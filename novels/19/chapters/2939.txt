2940 Fatal Trap

“For the sake of the main body!” another 10 people shouted loudly, and then fused together, turning into a creature that was 30 meters tall. It had many arms, legs, and eyes, becoming a complete monster.

Thank you readers!

Two Sixth-Tier monsters.

More and more people released loud roars and fused together, and there were more and more Sixth-Tier monsters.

Ling Han sighed. After these people were fused together, they possessed the unique trait of Hysteria, and he could not absorb their life essence. This was a pity, but they still had Heavenly Venerable Seals, and these would not disappear with their fusion.

…This time, he was not going to fall for Hysteria’s trick again. After he killed them, he would directly search their souls.

“Ling Han, it’s time for us to return to the main body,” Huang Dongyue said. Right now, only he and seven other people hadn’t fused together yet. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ling Han shook his head. “Not interested.”

“That’s not up to you!” Huang Dongyue let out a battle cry, and the eight Sixth Tier monsters immediately charged towards Ling Han. First-grade seals lit up, showing astonishing might.

Sixth-Tier battle prowess further boosted with first-grade seals; just how powerful was this?

“It really isn’t enough!” Ling Han was completely unconcerned. Fusion monsters only had the battle prowess of early-stage Sixth Tier. Even if they were boosted with first-grade seals, they would only be able to reach late-stage Sixth Tier in terms of battle prowess.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had already completely stabilized his cultivation level during these years. His basic power was similarly at the early stage of the Sixth Tier. He also possessed a first-grade seal, as well as ninth- and eighth-grade combination seals. Not only was his power not inferior, but it was even stronger.

However, there were eight Sixth-Tier monsters on the opposing side, after all. If they worked together, they could still match Ling Han and his group, with only a slight disadvantage.

“Charge!” Huangfu Dongyue and the others also charged towards Bai Mifan, Fu Yuan, and Xuan Feng.

The battle royale began. Though Bai Mifan was a Fourth Tier, he was a super genius that was not inferior to Xin Qihu. Moreover, after all these years, he had also reached the peak stage of the Fourth Tier, and his battle prowess soared to peak-stage Fifth Tier. Not only was he not inferior to Huangfu Dongyue and the others, he wasn’t at a disadvantage even in a battle of two against one.

However, Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng weren’t as powerful. It should be known that Huangfu Dongyue and the others had all received a first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal inheritance package from Hysteria. With the boost of more than 80 times of power, they were instantly pushed to their limits.

Moreover, Huangfu Dongyue and the others still had an advantage in numbers. If it weren’t for Bai Mifan continuously rescuing them, Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng wouldn’t have been able to last this long at all.

Even so, they were still in a perilous situation. It was possible that they would collapse at any moment.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and as he exchanged blows with the eight fusion monsters, he continued to rush towards Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng.

Boom!

He threw out a punch, instantly sending three Fifth Tiers flying, and resolving Xuan Feng’s pressing crisis. However, Fu Yuan was struck by two Fifth Tiers, and instantly threw up blood violently. He stumbled, his face as pale as paper.

Ling Han hurriedly charged forward. Although the eight fusion monsters tried their best to stop him, they still couldn’t succeed.

He stretched out a hand, and grabbed out at Fu Yuan.

Right at this moment, light suddenly lit up on Fu Yuan’s chest. Xiu, xiu, xiu! Three spots of light flew out, and then rapidly enlarged, turning into three figures… no, no, no, they could not be considered figures, but rather three monsters, but the aura they exuded was incredibly terrifying.

Furthermore, the aura they exuded was incredibly strong, and had shockingly reached the Sixth Tier, even stronger than those eight fusion monsters.

They… were actually those three monsters that had sniped Ling Han in the Genesis World of the last era!

Why had they flown out from Fu Yuan’s body?

Had Fu Yuan been coerced?

Or… when he had been completely unaware, these three monsters had possessed him?

Er, this should not be possible. For better or worse, he was still a Fifth Tier elite, and even if he was no match for a Sixth Tier, how could he not have the slightest reaction when three Sixth-Tier elites had hidden themselves inside his body?

Hong! The three great Sixth Tiers attacked, each channeling a second-grade seal, which boosted their power by more than 70 times, pressing down on Ling Han.

The eight fusion monsters also took advantage of the opening to make their move. The number of Heavenly Venerable Seals flickering on their bodies instantly reached as many as 10, and their power increased explosively by more than 400 times.

These were… combination seals!

They had not used them previously, because they wanted to lull Ling Han into a false sense of security.

It should be known that there were a total of over 100 of them, and each of them had a first-grade seal, which was completely capable of forming a sequence.

Now, three peak-stage Sixth-Tier elites were attacking Ling Han head-on, and there were also eight other Sixth-Tier elites who were slightly weaker that had been boosted more than 400 times in power. They had also boosted their battle prowess to the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, and both sides formed a pincer attack.

This was a trap, a deadly trap aimed at Ling Han.

Everything that had happened previously had all been an act, all for the sake of this moment, to deal a fatal blow to Ling Han.

Fu Yuan smiled coldly. Judging by his understanding of Ling Han, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t be able to resolve this!

“Ling Han!”

“Boss!”

Bai Mifan and Xuan Feng both exclaimed in surprise. This seemed to be a dead end. Whether it was Xin Qihu or Feng Wuding in his place, they could only die helplessly.

Ling Han also felt his hair stand on ends. This was the battle prowess of a total of 11 peak-stage Sixth Tiers, and every single one of them was stronger than him. Furthermore, it was not just by a bit, either. Their combined force was enough to deal him severe injury.

But the more severe the circumstances, the calmer Ling Han became. He felt his fighting spirit rise up from the depths of his heart.

This was what was interesting!

He released a battle cry. Weng! All the dimensions in his body were released.

It was not just one or two, but a total of 200 of them. They were not projections, either, but actual dimensions.

200 medium-level dimensions that were extremely close to reaching high-level—what kind of concept was this?

So what if they were Sixth Tiers? Their bodies involuntarily trembled, and their attacks were slightly halted.

However, the Sixth Tier was the Sixth Tier, after all. As power surged, cracks appeared on the 200 dimensions.

Taking advantage of this chance, Ling Han leaped and retreated rapidly.

He grabbed Bai Mifan and Xuanfeng, and then tore a rip into space. He stepped through, and the 200 dimensions were absorbed into his body at the same time. Xiu! The hole in the Void closed up behind him.

In the instant that the hole in the Void closed up, Ling cast a deep look at Fu Yuan. It was as if he was staring at a dead man.

Then, he turned around and left resolutely.

Shua! A black shadow whipped over, exuding a terrifying aura that could suppress the ages and destroy the heavens.

Hysteria!

Heh, it was really one move after another.

Ling Han had no way out. If he left the Void at this moment, he would have to fight against those 11 Sixth Tier elites again.

He released a battle cry, and channeled all the eighth-grade seals at the same time. He burst with his full power to greet this blow from Hysteria.

Peng!

Instantly, his whole body trembled violently, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Even if Hysteria had only sent out a doppelganger, its power had still reached the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, and it was even stronger than those subordinates outside.

However, Ling Han still managed to block this blow.

Hysteria was incomparably cold. Though its first strike had not succeeded, it was completely emotionless. It delivered another attack. The black tentacle swept through the Void. Its main body was far away in the Realm Battlefield, but its attack still easily reached its target.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Ling Han had already taken a step. He tore a rip into space again, and instantly exited the Void.

Hysteria’s attack came. This strike had followed him out of the Void, and was continuing to whip towards Ling Han.

“Scram!” Ling Han roared loudly, and attacked with both fists. The 200 dimensions were unleashed at the same time, forming an incomparably powerful oppressive force. Finally, Hysteria’s tentacle was blasted back.
