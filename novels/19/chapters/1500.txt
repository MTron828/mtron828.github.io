1501 The Great Saint Takes a Disciple

In fact, the Star Sand Saint had long since wanted to take Gu Daoyi as his disciple. In his eyes, Divine Fetus was the highest-grade physique in this world, and added with his careful nurturing, not only would Gu Daoyi be capable of inheriting his legacy, he might even be able to surpass him, and advance into the Saint King Tier that he had always yearned for.

It was no longer possible for him to take that step himself, but if he could personally nurture such an invincible paragon saint, he would die happy.

Moreover, if he nurtured a Saint King, Gu Daoyi would definitely remember his good will. Then, even after he had passed, his son would have an incredibly dependable backer in the future.

But what the Star Sand Saint did not know was that Gu Daoyi was not one to appreciate his kindness. He was the Severing Mundane Ancestor, and what he lacked now was merely time and resources. That was why he had entered into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy in the first place.

In Gu Daoyi’s eyes, every single person in the Immortal Realm was an ant. Would he go out of his way to take care of an ant? You gotta be kidding.

At first, the Star Sand Saint had not planned to take a disciple so soon. Wasn’t that equivalent to inflicting a bitter disappointment on all the other students? But this time, Gu Daoyi had lost to Ling Han. He was afraid that Gu Daoyi would be thus disappointed, and his heart of martial arts would be moved. Hence, he decided to immediately take Gu Daoyi as his disciple.

This was equivalent to saying that the Great Saint was optimistic about Gu Daoyi’s future.

So what if he had lost once? What elite had not lost before he ascended to the apex? Climbing up the high peak of martial arts did not depend on a momentary dash, but rather depended on a long-lasting endurance.

What would be the use for you to be the quickest to rush halfway up the mountain?

What kind of insight did the Great Saint have? Furthermore, the Great Saint represented the will of the heaven and earth, and with such an announcement from the Star Sand Saint, it was equivalent to having delivered a strike on everyone on behalf of the heaven and earth, and cut off their hopes of becoming a Saint.

This naturally made everyone feel anxious. A great number even thought of leaving the academy.

The point of them entering the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, wasn’t it all for competing for the place of the last true disciple of the Star Sand Saint, so that they, too, could become Saints? Now that this person was decided, what was the point of them staying any longer?

This could absolutely not be allowed to happen!

Ling Han immediately planned to stop them. What a joke, he was planning to lay a trap for Gu Daoyi, but what if he went out on a trip and came back, and everyone had left the academy? How was he going to spread out the news by then?

Running over and personally inviting Gu Daoyi?

Did he really take him as an idiot!?

Ling Han thought for a moment, raced out, and began to shout loudly, telling everyone not to waver. Even if the Saint had personally chosen him, so what? Man could conquer nature!

It did not absolutely mean success if they had competed, but if they did not, that meant definite failure!

Everyone had managed to enter the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, which meant that their aptitude was clearly high. All of them had hopes of becoming a Saint; how could they give up their conviction just because of one word from someone else?

Furthermore, it would be easier for them to pursue if they had a target ahead of them, stay behind... and surpass Gu Daoyi!

When these words were thrown out, they made the whole eighth campus flare up.

Right, as long as Gu Daoyi had yet to become a Saint, everything was still undecided. Moreover, there was not much advantage in returning to cultivate anyways. On the other hand, there were many king tiers here, and not only could these other king tiers incite one’s fighting spirits, they could also be sparring partners.

Many of them were the type to grow from battles. The more they fought, the stronger they would grow. When they returned, they were invincible and had no equal, which also meant that they would stagnate and not advance further. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Stay behind; even if they lost, they could not escape. They had to lose with their heads held high!

If this was another person, their words would definitely not have such weight. Ling Han was different, though. The reputation of a troublemaker like him had grown from fighting, and he had gotten the first place among the new students not too long ago too. His abilities were above Gu Daoyi’s. In the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, in terms of abilities, Ling Han still could not be considered a big shot, but in terms of reputation and fame, he was faintly close to catching up with the big shots.

These words spread from the eighth campus to the other campuses, and greatly encouraged every single person. Though there were still some people that chose to leave, the majority stayed behind. In any case, many students had enrolled this time round, so even if a few hundred had left, there was still a larger number than the previous years.

Only then did Ling Han breathe a sigh of relief. He was going to create a Saint King-level treasure trove later, and it would definitely lead to an uproar in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. It would be the topic of every conversation. Then, he would get some items of the Celestial Realm that only Gu Daoyi would recognize, and make him think that it was a Celestial level treasure trove. He would definitely be tempted.

Hehe, he himself was a little impressed by his quick wits. He had easily pacified the rest.

Sigh, he was really trying his best for the sake of his wife.

Ling Han brought along the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, preparing to depart and set out on their trip. After they left the academy, they would proceed into a galactic journey through the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. But they had just exited the doors when they were blocked by a large group of senior students.

“Ling Han!” A senior student walked out. He was in the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Previously, even the medium extreme was unable to stop Ling Han. Now, it was natural that they could only mobilize those in the high extreme, and furthermore, it was even one in the peak stage. His battle prowess had even soared up into the consummate level.

Would that still be unable to suppress Ling Han? No way!

“What is it?” Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he saw that these senior students all wore complicated expressions. They were not all furious as they had once been, immediately wanting to commit violence the moment they’d seen him.

“We’ve also heard some things about you, and have to admit that we are impressed,” the senior student continued. “How about this? We’ll make an exception for you. You don’t have to crawl through the dog’s hole, but traditions cannot be abandoned. Just make a public apology to everyone and yield, and you will be a true member of the eighth campus from then onwards.”

This was due to how Ling Han’s many actions previously were much too impressive, especially how he dared question Saint Missus, Zhu Xiu’er. Even the big shots would have to give him a thumbs up and admit their own inferiority. No, even the Nine Saints would have to admit they were impressed.

Thus, the seniors made the largest compromise, and no longer demanded to take Ling Han down a notch. However, this matter could not be forgotten just like that. Thus, Ling Han would also have to compromise on his side, and then they would all be one big family.

In their eyes, Ling Han would definitely agree to this. After all, Ling Han’s cultivation level was too low. In the next million years, at least, he would still be restricted by those in the high extreme and consummate level of the Eternal River Tier and the four big shots.

Could you survive having people staking you out everyday for the next million years? No way!

Ling Han did not even give the idea any consideration, and directly shook his head. He said, “I will not apologize!”

What a joke, what did he do wrong? Nothing!

Since that was the case, why did he have to apologize?

If he had done wrong, he would’ve admitted his mistake, but he did not do anything wrong, so why would he need to bow his head in submission?

He had previously questioned Zhu Xiu’er; wasn’t it also because of this?

Even the might of the Great Saint was unable to make him submit, what more trash like you people?

Seeing the determined expression on Ling Han’s face, the seniors looked livid. They had already made such a large compromise, yet Ling Han actually was unwilling to compromise even in the slightest? It should be known that he only had to apologize in front of all the members of the campus. Was that a humiliation to him?

No, no, no, you already had the upper hand, having managed to make the seniors compromise and only demand an apology from you!

Why did he still not agree!?

He had gone too far!

The senior in the lead couldn’t help but wear a dark expression as he said, “Junior Brother Ling, we have said all the nice words, and if you are still being disobedient, I can only use brute force!”

He moved. Boom, a giant palm suddenly appeared in the air, grabbing out at Ling Han. There were over 10,000 stars entwined around it. Merely the aura exuding from it was enough to make anyone in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier collapse on the ground.

Ling Han waved a fist, and a blood crow appeared. Flapping its wings, it greeted the large hand. As its wings spread, innumerable feathers transformed into swords that shot out, bringing with them the power of Tide of the Ages as if to rip into the skies.
