Chapter 905: Bribed with a Single Meal

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If Small Tower had facial expressions, it would currently definitely be dumbfounded.

After a moment of speechlessness, it finally said, “This descendant of the White Tiger’s injury most likely is a brain injury!” It really thought of itself as a cat; it was a bit of a retard.

“Little cat, come over quickly. I also have a ball!” Li Weiwei picked up the ball of wool on the ground, and then gave it a toss.

The fat cat could not restrain itself and pounced over, but then became so furious it erupted into a loud series of meowing, feeling incredible regret. Why was it that it had completely no resistance against woolen, ball-like objects?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Fat cat, let’s be friends. In the future, you can eat as much of the barbequed meat here as you like until you’re full, how about it? Though you can snatch it, I can still choose not to take it out. Furthermore, I could still choose to eat elsewhere as well.”

If it had been before it had tasted the delicious food inside the Black Tower, the fat cat would have naturally disdained this offer as something beneath its contempt. ‘Are you kidding me? Just giving me some food, and you want to be friends with me? In your dreams!’

But now, it merely had to think about the food inside the Black Tower, and it would already be drooling. It had stood guard here early on today; wasn’t it precisely because it wanted to snatch the food?

It could not help but feel troubled. As the White Tiger, its pride compelled it to be more strong-willed, and not submit for the sake of mere food, but as a glutton, it could not resist such temptation.

“Isn’t it just a friendship? I’m not seeking any benefits from you,” Ling Han cajoled smilingly.

“Meow!” The fat cat nodded, and felt that Ling Han’s words were very reasonable. In any case, there was no need for it to sacrifice anything in exchange.

Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er were both shocked. One had to know that this cat had been described as incomparably frightening by Zhang Deman, and was an existence that could definitely not be trifled with. But now, it actually agreed to befriend Ling Han; they were practically... dumbfounded!

Most importantly, it was because this White Tiger was really too young, and would easily be deceived. Otherwise, it if was a cunning guy like Rabbit, just try and see if it would be fooled.

Ling Han took out more food—not just barbequed meat, but also other kinds of delicious delicacies.

With thousand-year-old Spirit Herbs as supplementary ingredients, in a small world, this would be considered an incredibly extravagant meal, but in the Immortal Realm, it was more ordinary. That was because the lifespan of Immortals was really too long. Moreover, powerful forces could separate out an area to be used for the cultivation of Spirit Herbs, and after a few thousand years, they similarly could harvest a considerable amount of thousand-year-old Spirit Herbs every year.

However, in terms of numbers, it could not compare in any way to the production rate of the Black Tower at all. Hence, even Li Weiwei, a daughter of the Left Minister, could not help but gasp in surprise when she saw how extravagant Ling Han was.

Could it be that a small world was so wealthy?

Naturally, everyone ate this meat to their hearts’ content. Though the fat cat belonged to the tsundere category, that was a natural temperament induced by the pride deserving of a Divine Beast. But as it feasted, it also relaxed, and lay down lazily on its back, allowing Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er to rub its tummy, completely at ease.

It was a majestic descendant of a Divine Beast, yet was actually bought by a meal; how disgraceful!

Ling Han summoned the Gold-seeking Rat as well, but did not allow Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er realize it. They only thought that he had brought it out from inside his rooms.

The moment it saw the rat, the fat cat immediately reacted on instinct. Abruptly, it turned over and got to its paws, intending to do its rightful duty. Meanwhile, the Gold-seeking Rat was completely frozen as it flopped onto the ground with a pa , pretending to be dead.

It was really scared half to death!

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “This is my pet, so don’t scare it!”

Only then did the fat cat lick its claws in an aloof manner. Since it had agreed to a friendship, it did have to give Ling Han some face.

The Gold-seeking Rat scrambled onto Ling Han’s shoulder with a xiu . One of its tiny claws pointed at the fat cat, and it squeaked loudly, trying to say: ‘this big guy wants to eat me; Master, you must give me justice.’

Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er clicked their tongues in wonder. It was not uncommon for a Demonic Beast to have intelligence. In truth, the majority of Demonic Beasts that had reached the Shattering Void Tier would even be capable of speech, and those that had advanced into Immortal level could even take human form.

But, it was really rare to see such a cute baby rat, causing their beautiful eyes to light up as they fought each other over it. This scared the Gold-seeking Rat so badly it began playing dead again as it thought that these two women wanted to eat it.

In the time it took for this meal, Ling Han had established a business alliance with the two women. The two of them would be in charge of opening the channel of sales, and he would be responsible for supply. The profits would be divided 50-50 between them, wherein Ling Han would earn one half, whereas Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er would share equally their half of the profits.

Li Weiwei was in high spirits; this was an important opportunity that could change her image.

In the eyes of her old father, she was definitely a young mistress that only knew to spend money, but who didn’t have their own pride? Li Weiwei wanted to prove that she was not merely a rich young lady that could only depend on the benefits of having a good father.

She was filled with fighting spirit, and quickly departed with Ji Yun’er, impatient to go out and do something great.

Meanwhile, Ling Han strolled to the library of the Northern Institution.

Since it was a library, it naturally contained innumerable books, which included cultivation techniques, martial arts techniques, alchemical techniques, formation techniques, and so on. But, the Academy would not allow you to obtain them for nothing. You would have to work hard to earn academic credits to exchange for these things.

Of course, that applied for Immortal level students. Secret techniques meant for the Shattering Void Tier were completely not in the consideration of the Academy, and all students of the Academy could peruse these techniques freely.

Thus, Ling Han did not have to worry about not having academic credits and not even having the right to enter into the library.

‘Academic credits? I would have to begin consider obtaining them in future,’ Ling Han mused. Unless he took some higher-up of the Academy as master, he would have to think of his own ways to obtain Immortal level cultivation techniques.

They could be auctioned off at an auction house for True Origin Stones, but the cultivation techniques that could be obtained from an auction house would definitely be incredibly exorbitantly priced. Even if he opened the channel of sales for the food inside the Black Tower, he could not possibly compete in wealth with the various rich and powerful people in the Imperial Capital.

Or at least, before his alchemy prospered, he could only think of means to earn academic credits and exchange them for cultivation techniques from the library.

He did not want to take anyone as master. After ascending to the position of monarch, his personality had also changed, and he now had the pride as befitting of an emperor.

In the whole world, who would be capable of becoming master to an emperor?

He arrived at the entrance to the library, and saw an old man seated at the door. His whole head was covered with white hair, covering him so fully that even his face could barely be seen. His upper body was continuously swaying to and fro ever so little, and he seemed to be sleeping very deeply.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then walked around him as he headed in.

Pa , a walking stick stretched out, blocking his path.

“Kid, are you planning on stealing a book?” This old man suddenly raised his head.

“I would not dare. I merely wanted to borrow books to read,” Ling Han explained.

The old man cast a meaningful look at Ling Han for a while, then said, “Print your palm on that rock, and you would naturally know how many levels you may enter and what kind of secret techniques you can flip through.”

“Thank you for your guidance, Senior.” Ling Han nodded, and looked at the stone pillar ahead of him. It was about half the height of a man, and there was a jade stone on top. It was only slightly bigger than the size of a palm.

He stretched out a hand and pressed down. He instantly felt a numbing in his consciousness, which immediately returned to normal. If it was not for the fact that his spirit was incomparably sensitive, he could not have possibly felt it at all.

Seeing the surprised expression on Ling Han’s face, the old man could not help but give a “yi”, and asked, “You were actually able to sense a bit of your spirit being drawn out?”

Ling Han’s expression suddenly changed drastically. The spirit was incredibly important, and now, a sliver of his spirit had actually been drawn out?

“Don’t worry, it will not have any effect on you,” the old man said, smiling. Then, waving his hand, he said, “Go in!” After seeing Ling Han vanished, he could not help but mumble to himself, “This kid’s spirit is actually so sensitive. This has indeed made me feel like cherishing his talent; he would be worth observing for a while.”
