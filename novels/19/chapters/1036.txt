Chapter 1037: Absolute Beginning Stone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If Pei Ji had still been in his prime, then even if he was unable to dodge this arrow, he would at least have been able to avoid a critical hit to his vitals.

However, he had been ganged up on by five great Demonic Beasts, and had already received severe injuries, with his battle prowess taking a drastic drop. How would he have been able to avoid this arrow?

He looked at his chest with slight confusion, then pointed at Ling Han, and uttered, “Brat, I will definitely tear you into pie—”

Pa!

He had not finished saying the word “pieces” when his chest suddenly exploded. It was impossible for him to ever finish that final word.

His expression was filled with unwillingness; he collapsed heavily onto the ground, his blood spilling all over.

This treasure trove was obviously incredibly sturdy. The battle just now had not damaged it in the slightest, and now, the blood of a Mountain River Tier cultivator was naturally unable to damage it, either.

“Many Shadows Embodiment Technique!” Ling Han babbled, and xiu , entered into the Black Tower.

“Damn, damn it!” The four powerful Demonic Beasts were all furious. They had been tricked once by Ling Han just now, and now, for some inexplicable reason, they allowed him to escape. They had really lost face here.

“What kind of movement technique is that? How could it be so strange?”

“We have fallen for his trick. This old human bastard was not in the same group as that little bastard; instead, they were enemies.”

“Damn it, we’ve been used. Without us acting, that little bastard would definitely not have been able to kill that old bastard!”

“We’ve been horribly tricked!”

The five Demonic Beasts were in a towering rage, but now that Ling Han had disappeared without a sign, what else could they do?

After raging for a while, they left one by one.

The extraordinary images here were incredible, and might attract even more powerful Demonic Beasts. By that time, their only fate would be devoured.

Ling Han, too, came out of the Black Tower. He left the treasure trove, and followed the crowd. He once again entered into the Black Tower to study that mysterious stone slab.

“Small Tower, do you know what this is?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Small Tower’s figure surfaced. It lightly swayed, and replied, “This is the Absolute Beginning Stone.”

Ling Han asked because he wanted to try his luck and maybe get an answer. He had not thought that Small Tower would really know it, however, so it stunned him for a moment. Then, he continued, “Tell me more details.”

Small Tower humphed, and finally replied, “In the beginning when the heaven and earth split, it was among the most ancient stones, and is an evolution of the Chaos Source Rock.”

Ling Han knew of the Chaos Source Rock. Previously, when he had still been in the Lower Realm, he had obtained a large piece Asura Demon Emperor kept constantly. Furthermore, he had even managed to trick the latter heavily because of it.

“Then it is an incredible treasure!” he exclaimed, slightly excited.

“Sorry, aside from the fact that it’s a bit old and a bit sturdy, the Absolute Beginning Stone does not have any special property. It is merely a material used to record history,” Small Tower immediately interrupted.

“Ah...” Ling Han was immediately disappointed. This was something he had snatched back when he fully knew he faced the risk of being heavily thrashed, and it actually could not be considered a treasure?

Hold on.

Ling Han immediately said, “That’s not right. No power can penetrate this stone, and it can absorb all power, so how would one be able to carve words on this?”

“Hoho, since it cannot be penetrated by any power, how could it have been shattered into pieces, then?” Small Tower countered.

‘This...!’

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Even if it is the Absolute Beginning Stone, there should be a maximum limit to the power of the attacks it can absorb. When the power has exceeded this limit, even the Absolute Beginning Stone would only be shattered.”

“So the child can be taught.” Small Tower put on an air of maturity.

However, the Black Tower had existed for who knew how many millions—or perhaps it should even be counted in billions or trillions—of years, so it did indeed have the right to act mature.

“Though the Absolute Beginning Stone is no treasure, because its history spans very far back, it is treated by many as a plaque of greatness to sing praise of the feats their ancestors have achieved, so it could still be considered quite a rarity,” Small Tower continued.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Though I feel quite good about myself, I am still not so arrogant as to set up a plaque to sing praise for myself. I’ll just use this thing as a shield. Oh, right, what kind of power could break it?”

“Power of the Genesis Tier would be able to break it,” Small Tower replied.

Ling Han’s eyes widened, and he said, “Then wouldn’t it have to be someone of the Genesis Tier?”

Small Tower did not reply, apparently thinking that this question was very stupid, so it could not even be bothered to answer.

“Then this shield is really quite useful. Unfortunately, it’s too small.” Ling Han appeared quite satisfied because this stone slab was completely capable of absorbing attacks, and if properly used, it would show amazing effect.

But because it was too small, if he encountered a powerful Demonic Beast that used its mountain-like body to smash him, it would be a complete waste as it would not be able to protect him at all. When met with the punch of an elite, or even transformed into something akin to a star, it would be completely ineffective as well.

‘That would depend on how it’s used.’

Ling Han came out of the Black Tower. Immediately, the terrifying water pressure surged over. He tried to use the Absolute Beginning Stone, and it was really effective. Wherever he placed it, the pressure there would disappear completely. Unfortunately, he could only protect a spot about the size of his palm.

Ling Han simply treated it like a protection for his heart. The heart, the head, and Dantian were the three most crucial vital points of any cultivator. Losing the first two could be fatal, whereas the Dantian was the source of one’s power. If it was broken, then one would be equivalent to a cripple.

He began to float towards the surface of the sea. Because there was powerful gravity, the buoyancy also seemed to have completely disappeared. The speed that he was floating upwards at was very slow.

Boom!

The waters rippled, and a huge Demonic Beast suddenly appeared ahead of him. It was a giant crocodile that possessed as many as six legs, and was over 900 meters long. It was completely covered in scales that were even larger than the lid of a well. Merely its tail alone was more than 300 meters long.

Ling Han could see it because its two eyes were shining with light like two balls of fire. At the same time, he also felt an indescribable pressure.

The Sun Moon Tier!

The giant crocodile had also discovered his presence, and immediately accelerated with a swing of its tail, opening its mouth to eat him.

Ling Han did not have any intention of escaping by a fluke. He directly ducked into the Black Tower. If this huge mouth bit down, it was definitely not something that could be blocked by the Absolute Beginning Stone. It might not even be able to fully protect his heart, and the other parts of his body would be turned into mush.

The huge crocodile’s mouth snapped shut with a loud sound, but a hint of confusion shone in its eyes because it had not bitten anything at all.

Hu!

The sea waters surged. This time, the Black Tower was not swallowed down by the huge crocodile, because there was a massive gap in between its teeth. The Black Tower had long since flowed out with the water, and was immediately pushed out a few hundred meters away by the powerful waves.

‘The Sun Moon Tier is really too powerful,’ Ling Han mused inside the Black Tower.

If he had met with an opponent in the consummate level of Mountain River Tier, then even if he was no match for the other party, he would’ve still held up for a while somehow, just like when he had been simultaneously attacked by the five Demonic Beasts in the consummate level of Mountain River Tier. He had only spat out a few mouthfuls of blood back then.

However, he believed that he would be instantly reduced to a mush of flesh and blood if he was really bitten by this colossal crocodile.

The gap was really much, much too big.

The huge crocodile had an obvious wrinkle in its brow. When one had reached the kind of cultivation level it was on, its intelligence was completely awakened, and it was not the slightest bit different from any human’s. It was merely unwilling to take on human form in the deep sea. If not, others would really be unable to tell how it was different from other humans.

A mere cultivator in Mountain River Tier was actually capable of evading its bite?

‘Strange!’
