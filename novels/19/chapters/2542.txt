Chapter 2543: United Origin Manifestation Fruit

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han had a strange expression on his face. “In other words, if it hadn’t been me, but rather another person that had the same bloodline as I do that had encountered the Tower of Three Realms, it would also have recognized him as its master?”

Put this way, it was like all his effort was completely overlooked, and it all came down to sheer good luck instead.

“You can’t say that.” The large black dog patted Ling Han’s shoulder. “A precious tool itself is only an exterior object. Perhaps, if another person had obtained the Tower of Three Realms, he, too, would have been able to change his destiny, and rise up to become an overlord. However, Grandpa Dog can be certain that it is absolutely impossible that this person could have achieved what you have achieved now.”

He said seriously, “At the height that you are now, you are already no weaker than the Lord Heavenly Venerate had once been. In fact, you have surpassed him!”

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s Evolution Index had only been 11, and he had only just taken that last step after reaching the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier after countless years. And Ling Han’s Evolution Index was close to 12. As long as he truly reached that level, he would definitely be able to become a Heavenly Venerate himself.

Another example was… Huo Furong.

In this aspect, Ling Han had already surpassed the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

Ling Han nodded slowly. That slight bit of confusion immediately dispersed.

Indeed. His rising was due in part to good luck, but in truth, what supreme elite’s rise did not have an element of luck to it? But to climb to that highest pinnacle, one could only depend on one’s own effort.

For example, Ling Han had already formed his own Dao now, and his Intent Realm was close to consummate level. As long as he had enough time, he would gradually reach consummate level, and truly walk a path that was uniquely his own.

This was his own effort, and had nothing to do with the Black Tower.

The group continued onwards. Wally continued to release ripples of green, which could effectively determine whether the great beasts attacking were real or fake.

Furthermore, with Wally’s calculations, they soon found the right path.

Every time they passed a nodal joint in the space, there was actually a crossroads in the passageway. But real crossroads were the same as false crossroads, and vice versa, so if it were not for the fact that they had a guy who was an analysis freak like Wally with them, no one would have noticed at all.

More than a dozen days later, they finally walked out of this passageway.

A bright sky appeared ahead of them. There was a blazing sun shining brightly, with sunlight dazzling.

Everyone was invigorated. After being trapped in this passageway for so many days, they had finally seen the light of day again, which caused them to feel an indescribable feeling of ease.

“Strange.” They looked up, and they were all surprised.

Because there was a brightness here, but the sky not far away from them was still inky dark, there was a wild storm raging in the sky that was connected to the other side, and there were fiery flames further ahead, and lightning flashed furiously.

Upon counting, there were exactly nine different extreme weather conditions.

“Nine completely different environments, and there just happen to be Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier. Does this symbolize something?” Ling Han asked.

Liu Yufei answered, “This is just a coincidence. It is because only with the combination of these nine environments can the United Origin Manifestation Fruit be nurtured.”

“United Origin Manifestation Fruit?” Everyone was surprised. What was this now?

Liu Yufei continued, “I read about it in an ancient book. This United Origin Manifestation Fruit is nurtured with the blood essence of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King upon his death, and he would lay out the Ninth Heaven Stars Formation. Through countless years of growth, it would finally ripen.”

Everyone exchanged looks. They had read through a lot of books themselves, but why have they never heard of such a thing?

“What is the use of the United Origin Manifestation Fruit?” Liu Hao asked.

“The fruit of cultivation of a whole lifetime of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!” Liu Yufei said slowly. “And Celestial King He Feng was qualified to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, so his fruit of cultivation would be amazing. Without me explaining, I am sure you all can guess some part about it, right?”

Everyone’s heart throbbed wildly. Even if they all could attain Ninth Heaven without any obstruction at all, that needed time, after all. Furthermore, it was not just one or two years, but rather tens of billions of years.

This was too long.

But with a single United Origin Manifestation Fruit, they could directly advance to the Ninth Heaven, so how much time could this save them? Moreover, they would also be granted a peek into a sliver of the profound secrets of advancing into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and that was what was the most important.

…It was even better than the man’s personal notes and insights.

“And you are telling us so generously?” Huo Furong asked gravely.

Liu Yufei smiled slightly. “Firstly, without the cooperation of everyone, none of us would be able to close this Nine Heavens Stars Formation, so what need is there to speak of retrieving it? Secondly, as far as I know, there is not just a single United Origin Manifestation Fruit. There is enough of it to be shared among all of us.”

Could she be trusted?

Everyone had this question in their minds, but Liu Yufei was only a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, after all. Even if she was a supreme monarch star, so what? They did not fear that she would become violent with them at all.

“Since that is the case, we should all work together for the sake of the celestial fruit!” Xiao Yingxiong said.

Liu Yufei smiled slightly, and said, “So please work with me, everyone. Regarding the situation here, I am sure that I know more than all of you.”

Everyone nodded.

They advanced. The environment in this area was the most normal. There was no wind or rain, just the bright sun blazing, improving their moods as well.

“Be careful. Though this area does not carry any killing intent, the danger level here would not be much less than in any other place,” Liu Yufei warned.

As if trying to confirm her words, images of light flashed ahead of them, forming two human figures. They were entirely made up of rays of light.

Xiu, a light figure attacked them first, shooting out a blast of light that swept towards them.

It was extremely fast, but not as fast as Wally, allowing everyone enough time to stretch out a hand, and lay out a defense in front of them.

Instantly, the ray of light was sliced into nothing.

“So weak?” everyone asked.

When the words fell, they all laughed in spite of themselves. When they saw the ray of light, they inevitably thought about Wally. However, could any light attack be comparable to Wally’s attack?

Huo Furong leaped out, and struck out with her right hand, slicing out a wave of flames.

Pu, pu,?the two light figures were instantly cut in half, and a bizarre scene appeared. After the flames had sliced past them, their bodies stuck back together again.

“They are indeed not so ordinary,” everyone said.

For better or worse, this was what a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had laid out, and he was close to touching the Heavenly Venerable Tier at that, so there was no way it could possibly be so simple.

Xiu, xiu, xiu,?rays of light shot out rapidly.

Everyone leaped apart as they attacked endlessly.

The third light figure appeared, and then it was the fourth, the fifth, and so on. There were more and more of them, and this brought tremendous pressure to all of them.

…When numbers had broken through a certain limit, it would result in a qualitative change.

Of course, this was also because the light figures themselves were very strong, and had roughly reached the Fourth Heaven Celestial King Tier. Otherwise, no matter how many of them there were, there was no way it could lead to a qualitative change.

The number of light figures were endless, and after their numbers had surpassed 1,000, everyone felt excessive pressure.

Even the Imperial Void Celestial King was frowning slightly. Though he could defend himself very steadily now, if this number continued to increase further, and reach 2000, 10,000, or even 100,000, then even if he was the strongest in all eternity, he would not be able to last long.

“We can’t just defend ourselves passively.”

“We must destroy the formation eye!”

“Follow me!”

Liu Yufei shouted, “Please open the way for us, Ninth Heaven Seniors!”

Neither the Imperial Void Celestial King nor the large black dog refused. Now was not the time for personal grudges.

The two great elites opened the path ahead, and the group advanced. Naturally, they were moving like a hot knife through butter, but the further they advanced, the more of these light figures there were, which caused their progress to slow down inevitably.

Even the Imperial Void Celestial King had no choice but to summon the Ancient Bell of Qian, and toll out terrifying sound waves, which shattered these light figures.

He did not know if it was just a misconception, but he felt like the might of the Ancient Bell of Qian had declined greatly.
