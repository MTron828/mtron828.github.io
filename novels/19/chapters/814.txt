Chapter 815: Assault of the Elites

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The assault of the five clans of the middle state was something Ling Han had expected would happen, so he was naturally not surprised. On the other hand, that it had taken so long for someone from the five sects to come was actually slightly out of Ling Han’s expectations. This was most likely because they had been facing too much pressure from the Purple Moon Empire, and could only now draw out a portion of their people from the five sects.

He was a little expectant—who would be coming?

Ling Han walked out of the imperial palace, and saw a battleship hovering in the skies above the imperial palace. There was a raised flag on which was drawn a creature that could either be an earthworm or a long serpent on it.

The Earth Dragon Sect!

True, he had killed Jia Ming, so it was logical that the Earth Dragon Sect would send an elite to kill him in vengeance.

“Hmph, such a minor character would actually dare to establish his own nation and empire, what nonsense!” An ice-cold voice was heard from the skies.

This voice was a little familiar.

The Beast Snake King!

Ling Han immediately remembered him. Previously, when the Fifteen-eyed Corpse King appeared, a total of three Shattering Void Tier elites had arrived from the five great sects, and the elite from the Earth Dragon Sect was precisely this Beast Snake King.

“Hehe, bite me?” Ling Han laughed.

“Lord Beast Snake King, could you allow me to first battle with this person?” Xu Xiu Ran’s voice was heard from aboard the battleship.

“All right, this person could be considered your internal demon. As long as you eliminate this man, you would be able to break through to the Shattering Void Tier in the shortest amount of time. Furthermore, with your talent, as well as the full support and nurturing of your sect, it would not be difficult for you to rush up to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier in ten-plus years, with much awaited battle prowess.”

Although Xu Xiu Ran was not the strongest genius in the history of the Absolute Saber Sect, he was the only one who had been recognized by the Absolute Saber. Precisely because of this, even the Beast Snake King expected much from him, or in other words, attached much importance to him. After all, that old elder of the Absolute Saber Sect was still alive!

“Thank you, Milord!” Xu Xiu Ran leaped down from the battleship, and stood on empty air in the skies. He declared, “Ling Han, neither of us will use external aids. Let us have a good battle to our heart’s content!”

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “You are a little bit shameless. You obviously have the cultivation level of the peak of the Heaven Tier, yet proclaim your desire to have a good battle with me. I really don’t know what’s wrong with your head.”

He smiled faintly, and answered, “However, if I don’t battle with you, you would think I’m actually scared of you!”

Xiu , he leaped on empty air, and stood on the same level with Xu Xiu Ran. He said, “Come, I am the ruler of the Great Ling Empire. A bunch of clowns... see how I shall suppress you!”

Xu Xiu Ran humphed coldly, and said, “What ruler of the Great Ling Empire, you are merely a false ruler. Today, I shall kill you with my saber, so where would there still be any Great Ling Empire!”

Ling Han picked at his ear, and asked, “How many times have you said you would kill me? I’m already bored of listening to it, so could you try saying something new?”

“Then just die!” Xu Xiu Ran flew over, wielding the Absolute Saber in a slash in Ling Han’s direction.

There was not much technique in this move. It could be described in one word, and that was “fast”.

Xiu , the saber seemed to have just been raised, yet had already slashed down right in front of Ling Han. Saber Ray shone blindingly as if it were the beginning of the world.

This Xu Xiu Ran could really not be underestimated. Mere weeks had passed, and his abilities once again improved astonishingly. It was not in cultivation, but battle prowess. His comprehension of the path of the saber had increased greatly once again.

Weng , the Revere Life Sword in Ling Han’s hand was trembling as if it was about to fly out of his grip.

Saber Heart!

Ling Han smiled faintly. Sword Heart unfolded, and the Revere Life Sword immediately steadied. He raised his sword to parry, clang , and just managed to block the blade of the saber that Xu Xiu Ran had slashed at him with.

If it had been any other cultivator in the Deity Transformation Tier, or even in the Heaven Tier, they would have been likely beheaded by this strike without seeing more than a blur, for it was so fast that there was no possible way to block it. Even if the eyes could catch sight of the movement of the saber, if one moved too slowly, they would still be unable to block it, and could only use their Origin Power to take it head on.

But Ling Han was a body cultivator, and had furthermore improved his physique to the level of the Heaven Tier. It was naturally extremely easy for him to block this strike.

The sword and saber clashed, the friction giving rise to endless luster as blinding as the sun.

Ling Han gave a strong shove. Peng

. Xu Xiu Ran was sent flying by the force. He smiled, and said, “This strike is indeed very fast, but the power does not seem to be enough!”

Of course. Power and speed could not be simultaneously achieved. His strike was extremely fast, so its power was naturally lacking. This was also due to the fact that Xu Xiu Ran knew that Ling Han had a strange motion technique, and had deliberately practiced fast strikes. He had not thought that Ling Han was so atypical that he’d block it forcefully without even dodging or ducking.

With a flip of his body, he steadied his balance. He raised the Absolute Saber levelly, his eyes cold. Endless saber intent circulated inside his body, solidified, and gushed out, forming thousands of sabers around him.

There were all types and shapes, and they had all been formed from saber intent. This would not damage the physical body, but was capable of striking at one’s very soul, which was very terrifying.

Sword Heart, once mastered, could cut the soul, and Saber Heart, once mastered, could do it as well.

“Then take another strike from me!” Xu Xiu Ran declared coldly. His expression turned serious, and the Absolute Saber moved slightly, forming multiple ripples. “Cracking Wind Slash!”

Ling Han dared not be careless. The power of this slash was indeed frightening. He raised the Revere Life Sword to chest level, and the sword intent of the Mysterious Three Thousand circulated as a similarly tremendously powerful aura spread out.

“Yi?” Aboard the battleship, the Beast Snake King could not help but let out a light exclamation of surprise. Being the strong existence that he was, he naturally immediately realized that Ling Han’s sword intent gave him a feeling of familiarity. “This is... the Three Techniques of Black Origin!”

This was one of the ultimate techniques of the Heaven’s Sword Sect; he was definitely not unfamiliar with it.

Xu Xiu Ran gave a soft shout, and brandished the Absolute Saber in an attack. Instantly, the world around them paled, and only pure darkness was left behind. There was merely the endless brightness that was being exuded from the Absolute Saber, and it surged towards Ling Han.

Even if Ling Han opened his eyes, he would not be able to spot Xu Xiu Ran. The only thing left was that brilliant saber that was slashing down in his direction.

No sight of the wielder, merely the saber!

Ling Han remained unafraid. He simply closed his eyes, and merely used his heart to “see”.

Sword Heart.

A smile lifted up the corners of his lips. His long sword waved, delivering 3100 brilliant sword flashes. Each strike was severe, and they shot towards Xu Xiu Ran.

In theory, 10,000 Techniques Return to One was the strongest individual killing move, whereas the Mysterious Three Thousand was to be used in group attacks. Because the power of the attack was divided, its destructive power was naturally not on the same level as 10,000 Techniques Return to One. Yet Ling Han was too strong now, and added with the advantage the Revere Life Sword gave him, the power of even a single strike was enough to become a huge threat to Xu Xiu Ran. Thus, using the Mysterious Three Thousand was naturally even more effective as the range of attack could be widened.

Immediately upon contact, both sides were using their ultimate moves.

Hong!

Sword flash and saber flash clashed, creating a massive explosion in the skies. Temporarily, everyone had lost their sight and hearing, everything completely white in front of their eyes, and merely a soft humming was left in their ears.

When the light subsided, Xu Xiu Ran had already retreated 300 meters away. There was a total of five wounds on his body that blood was seeping out of, and no matter what he tried, the blood’s flow would not cease.

In case of a wound that had been inflicted by the Revere Life Sword, how could the bleeding be stopped so easily?

There were also three spots on Ling Han where his clothes had been torn open, but he was still mild and humid like jade, and it could not be seen that he was wounded anywhere—after his cultivation of his body art had entered the Heaven Tier, his physique had also once again improved to another level, and had reached the extent of Level Ten precious metal.

In the hands of a Shattering Void Tier elite, the Absolute Saber should be able to leave a mark on Level Ten precious metal as well, but if it was Xu Xiu Ran? It was obviously impossible!

Just a bit of a gap could mean a world of difference.
