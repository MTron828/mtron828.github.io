1291 Crossing the Border

That little beast was no ordinary beast. It could actually cause the Netherworld to launch such a large-scale battle, causing innumerable loss of life.

Why did they not directly say it, just directly demanding the Immortal Realm to hand over the little beast?

It was very simple. Once the Immortal Realm realized the extraordinary nature of the little beast, they would definitely capitalize on it, and by that time, the price the Netherworld would have to pay would not only be the deaths of so many people, but could possibly be much, much more than that.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be stunned. Exactly how important was this little beast that it would cause the Netherworld to spare no expense in their venture to take it back?

Though all this was merely his deduction, he had a very strong feeling that this was the truth behind the invasion of the Netherworld. Other theories, whether it was about treasure, or kidnapping women, were completely undependable.

However, who would believe such a crazy theory?

That was merely a little beast in the Mountain River Tier; could it really incite such a large war?

That was really the biggest joke ever heard!

Ling Han wanted to inform the Purple Moon Divine Maiden, but when he thought further about it, it was even more inappropriate.

In his opinion, it was best to return the little beast to the Netherworld, and then the Netherworld would naturally command the retreat of their army—even if he had guessed wrongly, they would not lack a harmless little beast. But what if the Purple Moon Divine Maiden believed his theory, but wanted to use the little beast as a threat against the Netherworld?

That could possibly cause the war to increase in scale!

This kind of deduction originated from the fact that the Netherworld had not revealed what they were looking for all this while. That was precisely because they did not want the little beast to become their weakness, or even cause some even more extreme people to kill the little beast.

If the little beast was used to threaten them, it could possibly have the opposite effect, and the Netherworld would erupt and go berserk.

Ling Han decided to move privately. He would find the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the two of them would bring the little beast back to the Netherworld to end this battle. Otherwise, it would only cause more bloodshed and death.

Because their army had serious casualties and injuries, there was temporarily no mission for them, and they were not recruited into other mercenary units, either. They were given a considerable amount of freedom. Thus, Ling Han easily left the camp, and came to camp of the Purple Moon Army.

Yet he could no longer enter into the Purple Moon Army camp. The military discipline here was strict, and even if Ling Han had the token given to him by the Purple Moon Divine Maiden, it was useless because it was presently a time of war.

Thankfully, Ling Han had also familiarized himself around the Purple Moon Army camp, and coincidentally met the group of girls he had met previously. He asked them to inform the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and after a while, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden appeared.

She was carrying the little beast, but what surprised Ling Han was that not even the slightest bit of an evil aura emerged from the little beast any longer. It was as if it was a locally born and bred Demonic Beast.

If Ling Han had not witnessed it with his own eyes, he would definitely not doubt that this little guy came from the Netherworld.

This further strengthened Ling Han’s deduction; this little beast was not ordinary!

“What happened?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked.

Ling Han nodded, and transmitted a message through divine sense, informing her of his analysis and deduction.

At first, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was stunned, and felt that this was practically a total nonsense. However, she did not immediately accuse Ling Han of letting his imagination run wild. Instead, she asked, “Are you sure?”

“I am at least 80% sure.” Ling Han nodded.

“Let’s go!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden obviously trusted Ling Han very much. Though Ling Han was not completely sure, she chose to believe Ling Han.

The two of them left the camp, and headed into the depths of the Two Realm Battlefield. They circled around the blockade line of the Netherworld. After all, this place was too large, so the Netherworld could not possibly completely seal off this place.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden could leave the camp for a limited time, but it could not be too long, or she would be treated as a deserter—and if the army that Ling Han was in was not like an empty shell, he would also be under severe restrictions.

“You go back first. I will send this guy to the Netherworld,” Ling Han said.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was filled with worry. In the eyes of beings from the Immortal level, the Netherworld was the very most dangerous place, with man-eating demons all around. Furthermore, though Ling Han had outstanding talent, he was still in the medium extreme of Sun Moon Tier, after all.

Now the Netherworld was launching a great invasion, and there were innumerable elites. How dangerous would this trip to the Netherworld be?

“Don’t worry, have you forgotten that I still have the Black Tower?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

Since he knew that there was a Celestial Realm, and the Black Tower was a Celestial Tool, if it really showed its might, even a Saint could be killed! But if he did that, the Celestial Realm would definitely be alerted, and there would be true supreme elites coming to seek the Black Tower. By that time, even if Ling Han hid in the Black Tower, he could still possibly suffer a calamity.

Hence, if he could avoid using the Black Tower, it was best not to.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden thought for a long time, but still handed the little beast over to Ling Han, causing the little beast to yowl loudly in anxiety. Who knew if it couldn’t bear leaving the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, or if it was afraid that Ling Han would kill it and make a soup out of it...

Ling Han could not allow this little beast to act spoiled. He picked it up, and his figure rapidly sped off.

Now, the people from both Realms were in a confrontation at the frontlines, and there were not many people here. Ling Han entered deeply into the central area of the Two Realm Battlefield. This had become a zone of chaos, the space incredibly chaotic.

Because this was the connection zone of the two worlds, directions would lose meaning in this place.

Ling Han determinedly walked on. In this place, a very serious collision happened between the Regulations from the two Realms, and they evaporated into nothing. Thus, it was impossible to draw on the Regulations of the heaven and earth here, and power was the only key factor of battle prowess.

But as he walked forwards, the Regulations reappeared, and a completely different space appeared in front of Ling Han.

In truth, this was also a galaxy, but Ling Han had a feeling that it was incompatible with the galaxy of the Immortal Realm.

This was a change of Regulations.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s mind, and the aura of the Demon Master rose up, shrouding his whole body. By now, whoever saw him would think he was from the Netherworld. That aura was completely different from the aura of a being of the Immortal Realm.

The little beast also changed, releasing an aura unique to the Netherworld. Indeed, it was like a chameleon, and possessed the ability to adapt to its environment.

Ling Han was stunned. What kind of breed was it exactly? How could it be so strange? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Jiu! Jiu!” The little beast bore its fangs and brandished its claws at Ling Han as if angered by the fact that he told the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to separate from it.

“Hey, hey, hey, that’s my wife, so the one who should be jealous is me!” Ling Han said with a grin.

Xiu!

A human figure suddenly appeared out of thin air. Ling Han had not sensed how he had appeared at all. It seemed as if he had been here all this while, and it was Ling Han who had not discovered his presence.

He was a sturdy man as tall as nine meters, his full body of muscles protruding boldly like mountains, exuding a frightening feeling of strength. He merely moved lightly, and the air itself exploded.

“Very good, very good. Little Master has finally been found!” This man laughed loudly, looking gratified. He stretched out his arm in a grabbing motion, and the little beast fell into his palm. He nodded at Ling Han, and said, “Brat, you have done a great merit. I have to immediately bring Little Master back, and have no time to reward you... well, hold on to this token, and come to the Chaotic Demon Palace to receive your reward.”

He tossed a silver plaque to Ling Han, and then disappeared into the distance with a large stride in an instant.

Only then did Ling Han get his breath back. Suppressed by the other’s genuine aura, he practically couldn’t even breathe.

The Eternal River Tier!

True enough, the Netherworld’s target was the little beast; furthermore, even an Eternal River Tier elite had to address him as “Little Master”. Did that mean that it was his master? No wonder they wanted to start war; the little beast’s identity was too important.
