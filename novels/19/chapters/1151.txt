Chapter 1152: Who is Ling Han?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What are you laughing at?” Hu Feiyun leaped out. “Ling Han is the most awesome, the very strongest!”

Everyone was astonished. They had not expected yet another person to speak up for Ling Han.

They were all seeds here!

What seed-level prodigy was not proud and arrogant? Yet Ling Han himself had not even appeared, but had already engendered the extreme admiration of several seeds. This was really unimaginable.

They became curious as well, wanting to see this mysterious man. How powerful exactly was this man, and how charismatic was he?

Yet flames of jealousy were ignited in Wu Zhe’s heart because these two extreme beauties, Hu Feiyun and Shao Sisi, had shown a fondness for Ling Han. Hu Feiyun was even more so; she looked like she would come to blows with anyone who dared to speak badly of Ling Han.

And this man had not even been qualified to enter into the Majestic Heaven Sect!

He was very displeased. Just think: as one of the six king tiers, usually, innumerable female disciples in the sect would throw themselves at him. However, his whole heart was concentrated on cultivation, so he had completely no interest in them. It was so rare that he had seen there were a few extremely beautiful women among the seeds this time, yet all of them exhibited great admiration for another man.

Damn it. He had better not meet this Ling Han in future, or he would definitely beat him to death.

“What a joke. Since he is as powerful as you Senior Disciples claim, why had he not been recruited by the sect?” a youth in green asked coldly. It was precisely Fu Liangye, who had been struck back by a sword light from Ling Han several days ago during the selection for followers.

At this moment, his hand was still wrapped in bandages. Though that was merely a casual sword light from Ling Han, his martial intent was contained within. How could it be so easily expelled?

Without expelling the martial intent, this wound would not heal.

“The way I see it, he is just a piece of trash. Everything is mere boasting,” he said disdainfully.

“Rubbish!” Ding Ping jumped out immediately. Pointing at Fu Liangye, he exclaimed, “Apologize now!”

“And what relation do you have with this matter?” Fu Liangye did not dare be careless. Though this youth had been defeated by Lan Luan, his abilities themselves were incredibly powerful and forceful. He might not have a good chance of winning.

“Because Ling Han is my master!” Ding Ping said with utmost seriousness. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Without Ling Han, he wouldn’t be where he was now. To Ding Ping, Ling Han was truth. One word from Ling Han, and he would even dare to brandish his fists at a Saint, so how could he allow others to speak badly of Ling Han?

Ah!

Everyone experienced a great shock. Instantly, Ling Han’s image was heightened endlessly.

Someone who could nurture a seed-level disciple... How amazing was that?

“Fight me!” Ding Ping shouted loudly. His fury soared high, and there were multiple flashes of divine light exuding from all over his body. He was much, much stronger than when he usually was.

“Huh?”

Ling Han was surprised. This disciple of his was really extraordinary. Could it be that with his fury, he was about to have an explosive burst of energy? Or could it be that he had awakened some ancient battle prowess, so he could push his battle prowess to a new height?

Fu Liangye humphed coldly, and declared, “I am in the medium extreme, and I can’t be bothered to bully you!”

Firstly, he was not sure that he could defeat Ding Ping, and secondly, his arm was still injured, so his battle prowess was far from his prime condition, so he was naturally afraid to do battle. In case he lost, and lost to an opponent in a lower cultivation level, what face would he have left?

Ding Ping still wanted to challenge him further when he saw the Rain Emperor leap out. The latter pressed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head at him. Ding Ping could only give up his idea. He was his second uncle, and with the absence of his master, he naturally had to obey the words of his second uncle.

“I, too, am in the medium extreme, so if I battle you, it would not be considered bullying you, right?” the Rain Emperor asked in a deep voice.

‘F*****!’

Fu Liangye felt baffled. Didn’t he just speak a few bad words about a person that no one had seen before? Actually, it couldn’t even be considered bad words. Wasn’t that just stating the facts as they were? Why was it that it seemed like he had punched a hole into the sky, with endless troubles following on his heels?

All of them wanted to challenge him?

“And what relation do you have with that Ling Han?” he asked. He was even more cautious with the Rain Emperor. He had witnessed the latter’s abilities, and even Wu Zhe was forced into a continuous retreat after he suppressed his cultivation level, and even was not capable of fighting back at one point.

Fighting with Ding Ping, he still had a chance of winning, but if he battled with the Rain Emperor, he did not even have the slightest confidence he could win.

The Rain Emperor brandished his fist, and replied, “Ling Han is my Fourth Brother.”

Pu!

Everyone was once again shocked. The disciple was a seed, the brother was also a seed. Your whole family had to be monsters, right? That was a little too strong, wasn’t it?

“Come fight me!” the Rain Emperor called out severely.

Fu Liangye’s expression changed drastically, but no matter how confident he was in himself, he did not dare battle with the Rain Emperor, what more when he was currently still injured.

However, he was the kind that could go with the flow, and immediately said, “I have not chosen my words well, and was rude and impetuous!”

So he had yielded.

Making a seed-level genius yield and apologize in public was a humiliation, but compared to being defeated in public, this was definitely much better. Hence, Fu Liangye had still made a wise decision.

Only then did the Rain Emperor nod and return to his initial position where he sat back down.

How domineering!

As everyone watched, they could not help but develop an impression of the Rain Emperor. Though this man’s cultivation level and abilities were not at the pinnacle, that domineering air was truly intimidating. There were definitely not many that could match him in this place.

Wu Zhe’s expression looked slightly ugly. At first, he had already taken control of the atmosphere, and everything had been centered on him. He’d been the only focal point, but now? His spotlight had been snatched away by a person that had not even been seen before.

“Senior Brother Disciple Wu, you have fought so many rounds, so you should take some rest, and let me have the stage.” A young man in white jumped out, wearing a dazzling smile on his face.

“Junior Brother Zhang!” Wu Zhe’s gaze jumped to him, and a sliver of caution appeared in his eyes.

This person’s name was Zhang Long. In the past, he had been equally famous as he. Their battle prowess was equally matched, but 100 years ago, Wu Zhe took a crucial step and formed his fifth Mountain River. Zhang Long, however, had not succeeded even until now, and the gap between the two of them was rapidly enlarged.

But Wu Zhe did not take this Zhang Long lightly, because the latter’s talent was really no worse than his own. It could only be said that he was not as fortunate, and that was why he had kept failing. But, who knew when Zhang Long would advance into the pinnacle level, and become capable of being on equal footing with him...

Wu Zhe thought for a moment, and stepped back with a nod, letting him have the stage. “Hoho, then I shall let Junior Brother Zhang have it.”

He had already exhibited enough of his power, and there was no need for him to continue showing off. Too far was as bad as not enough.

Zhang Long’s eyes swept over the masses. His eyes were obviously very gentle, but anyone who became the target of his gaze felt coldness rise up from the bottom of their heart as if they were being targeted by a venomous snake. Involuntarily, they lowered their heads, and dared not look him in the eye.

He was an elite, and even if he hadn’t formed his fifth Mountain River, he was more or less as powerful. He had powerful abilities that could crush all his peers.

Finally, his eyes stopped on Ling Han.

“Junior Brother Disciple, how about we spar?” he asked, issuing his own challenge.

Everyone was surprised. Zhang Long actually wanted to challenge Ling Han?

It should be known that Zhang Long had not entered into the Majestic Heaven Sect just over a year ago, but had been in the sect since 900 years ago. In such a great sect, he had been trained for 900 years. Even if he had not formed his fifth Mountain River, his power would definitely surpass that of any ordinary cultivator in the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier.

Gan Shiyun smirked icily. She had sacrificed a high-grade Godly metal in exchange for Zhang Long’s undertaking of this task. She wanted to teach Ling Han a harsh lesson, and cause him to be humiliated publicly.
