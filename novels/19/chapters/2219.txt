Chapter 2220: Finally becoming Immortal Palace Tier

Ling Han’s spirit channeled, and a power was mysteriously manipulating it. The Origin Power in his body surged, and the Regulations of Time turned into flames that were tempering his heart.

Though the Source Power of Time had left his body, it had still left behind its own brand, which exuded a weak mystical power, and cooperating with the Regulations of Time that he touched, they were tempering his heart together.

Ling Han’s soul was playing the role of a bridge. On one side, it was the Time Mystery Realm, and on the other, it was his physical body.

In this Mystery Realm, time was meaningless. An instant could mean eternity, but eternity could also be an instant.

In Ling Han’s body, his heart was being refined by the Regulations of Time, progressing towards becoming a Mystery Realm.

This would become a space of its own that could contain both items and people. It could also store up power, nourish precious Tools, and when it had reached the pinnacle, it would develop into a world of its own.

Ling Han suddenly had an enlightenment. It was no wonder that there were so many Mystery Realms in this world. Perhaps a considerable number of them were not naturally formed, but rather formed by Immortal Palace Tier elites.

His first Mystery Realm was taking form, and his small realm was also increasing frighteningly.

It was unknown how long had passed, and the first Mystery Realm, the Heart, was finally formed fully.

Boom!

Ling Han’s body trembled violently, and a majestic power was surging, about to gush out.

Xiu, his spirit suddenly moved, and was madly retreating the way it had come from.

The effects of the Thousand Year Dream Pill had ended.

“Er…” Ling Han released a moan, and suddenly snapped his eyes open. He felt like he was drenched in sweat, his whole person almost about to collapse.

Having his soul being forcibly plucked from his physical body was not something to play around with.

“Wu!” The Rain Emperor and the others also awoke at the same time. They were all holding their heads, appearing to be in incredible discomfort.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he couldn’t help but shake his head, looking disappointed.

Not one of the Rain Emperor and the others had actually broken through to the Immortal Palace Tier!

True, this was not something that could be accomplished in one go.

“Ling Han, you’ve broken through?” Hu Niu exclaimed with great delight. She could sese the terrifying wave of power from Ling Han’s body. It had far surpassed the level of the Dividing Soul Tier.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “Yes, I have.”

“Haha, it is still Fourth Brother that is the most outstanding!” The Rain Emperor nodded, not withholding his praise for Ling Han.

The five of them had started together, yet only one of them had broken through. Wasn’t the problem clear here?

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou did not feel the slightest envy. As they saw it, they wanted nothing more than for Ling Han to immediately become a Heavenly Venerate.

“Yi, what did we experience inside?” The Bewitching Maiden Rou suddenly asked, a questioning expression on her face.

Ling Han and the others were the same as well. Vaguely, they could feel that they seemed to have experienced some major event inside the Time Mystery Realm, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not recall it now. It seemed like there was some kind of mysterious power that had forcibly erased their memories.

“Just what in the world happened?” They scrambled their brains, but their gains were limited.

They vaguely remembered that they seemed to have been advancing along a mighty river. That was the flow of time, showing the past, present, and future. But now that they thought about it, they could not recall the slightest detail.

Then, it was a plain where time was chaotic, followed by a valley, where there were multiple crystals of time that developed into past and future.

There should be something else in this, but they could not recall it no matter what.

“Forget it, let’s not consider this problem now.” Ling Han stopped confusing himself with thoughts about this matter. “I will go to endure the heavenly tribulation first, and then I will concoct the Thousand Year Dream Pill again.”

He exited the Black Tower, and dark, stormy clouds instantly assailed him. Lightning flashed within, astonishingly terrifying.

In a few steps, Ling Han had already left the Saintly Origin Academy, and arrived in an uninhabited desolate forest, greeting the heavenly tribulation.

With a tremor of his figure, nine figures instantly stumbled out of his body.

“I have already severed my connections with you. From now onwards, you are all independent entities,” Ling Han said. These nine figures were the manifestations of the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth.

“Greetings, Master!” All nine of them bowed down at the same time.

Ling Han leaped up. As he greeted the oncoming heavenly tribulation, he asked, “Why do you address me as master?”

“You have a generous heart. You obviously could have enslaved us, yet did not do so. We are grateful for this. Secondly, you have lofty ambitions, and have astonishing good fortune. We will also be willing to follow by your side, and seek better future prospects for ourselves,” the nine of them said.

At first, Source Powers of heaven and earth would only have weak intelligence, and only through changes over time would they be able to develop a perfect intelligence. However, after they had fused with Ling Han, they would also be affected by Ling Han, allowing the awakening of their intelligence to speed up countless times over.

And now, they truly possessed actual intelligence, no different from any other person.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “All right. The invasion from the Foreign Realm is close at hand. I need enough strong people to assist me so that we can join forces to stand against the invasion of the Foreign Realm. You are all manifested from the Source Powers of heaven and earth. Once your intelligence has been awakened, your rate of cultivation will be incredibly shocking.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Yes, Master!” the nine of them answered in unison again.

Ling Han was practically dealing with the heavenly tribulation absent-mindedly. His battle prowess had long since reached the pinnacle of the Fourth Secret. Even if the heavenly tribulation he was presently enduring had also surpassed the height of First Secret, it was only about the level of Second Secret, at most. How could it threaten him?

Thus, as he carelessly parried the heavenly tribulation, he conversed with the nine of them.

“Do you have names?” If he called them something like Nine Heavens Flame, that wasn’t the name of a person at all.

“Not yet. Please grant us names, Master,” the nine of them said.

Ling Han nodded, and then said, “Nine Heavens Flame, you will be called Ling Huo. Xuanyin Source Water, you will be called Ling Shui. Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, your name is Ling Mu…” He absolutely did not have the slightest bit of creativity in naming, yet the nine of them were completely unconcerned[1].

Elites had never announced how strong they were through their names, but rather through genuine strength!

The lowest accomplishment of Source Powers of heaven and earth was the Celestial King Tier, and all of them had awakened intelligence. That was even more incredible. To say nothing of Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, at least Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier would not be too difficult.

Half a day later, the heavenly tribulation dispersed. Ling Han’s figure descended, and said, “Come, let’s return.”

He was filled with irritation and anger. Now that he had advanced into the Immortal Palace Tier, the first thing he was going to do is to seek Hong Huang out for a fight.

The 10 people returned to the academy. Ling Huo and the others passed through the gates of the academy as Ling Han’s followers. However, after they entered into the academy, they heard that Hong Huang had left eight years ago.

“Not just Hong Huang, but even Ji Wuming, Jia Lan, and Shi Chanzi have also left?” Ling Han murmured. It seemed like he had missed something these years.

“Han Lin, come with me.” An Ascending Origin Tier elite appeared. He was a teacher of the academy, and beckoned Ling Han over.

Ling Han nodded, and walked over. Then, he asked, “Dare I ask, my lord, has something happened?”

“I am not sure of the details myself. This is a command from Lord Eternity,” that Ascending Origin Tier elite answered.

Lord Eternity? That would have to be the Eternity Celestial King.

Ling Han naturally knew who the Eternity Celestial King was. He couldn’t help but feel surprised that he would actually be summoned by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Led by that Ascending Origin Tier, he arrived at a small courtyard. After he pushed the doors open and entered, that Ascending Origin Tier elite closed the doors behind him, and did not come in with him.

“Come, sit.” This small courtyard had not used any secret technique of Space. Thus, this really was a small courtyard. There was a man in white robes seated in the courtyard, his back facing Ling Han. He was presently brewing tea, and there were nine streaks of colored light entwined around him.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

[1] MC is basically just giving them his surname of ‘Ling’ + whatever their element is, so it would literally be something like Ling Fire, Ling Water, etc..
