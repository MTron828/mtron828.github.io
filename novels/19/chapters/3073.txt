3074 Heavenly Venerable Seals, Complete

The final battle… was about to begin!

Ling Han made some final preparations, doing his best to move as many people as he could into the dimensions inside him. The small Celestial Realm was already exploding with people.

There were countless dimensions inside Ling Han, and they were all high-level dimensions that were capable of hosting Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

Including the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others, Ling Han decided to move all of them into his body.

In this sense, no one could compare to Ling Han.

Take Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others, for example. They also had one or two dimensions inside them, and these dimensions had also been cultivated into high-tier high-level dimensions. However, they were unable to host life.

Without a secret code of life, how could they possibly manifest life?

Thus, only Ling Han was capable of doing this. Perhaps Extermination was capable of it too since she had also obtained some secret codes of life. It was just that she hadn’t obtained as many as Ling Han.

A while later, everyone under the Seventh Tier had already been moved into Ling Han’s body. It was as if he had transformed into a Genesis World.

In the outside world, only a measly few Seventh Tier ultimate elites remained.

They included Lin Luo, Xin Fu, Wu Zhihong, Bai Fan, and Blood Rainbow, the five experienced Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. In addition to them, there were also Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, Xin Qihu, and Bai Mifan, the six newly advanced Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. All up, there were 11 Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates present.

Including Ling Han, this was their final formation in the ultimate battle against Hysteria.

The Foreign Realm was falling at a rapid pace. After engulfing almost all of the Genesis World, Hysteria had already become incredibly powerful at this moment. It was advancing at an insane speed, using only a measly 300 years to engulf the entire Foreign Realm.

This was nothing more than a low-level dimension, so it was already unable to raise Hysteria’s power by much. However, engulfing the entire Genesis World was a complete process that involved engulfing all of the dimensions, regardless of how powerful or weak they were. Hysteria couldn’t give up on these dimensions simply because they were too weak. Otherwise, the process would be incomplete.

Ling Han was still cultivating. Before this, he had been fully focused on investigating secrets of the Genesis World such as the secret codes of life. Thus, he still had yet to fully deduce the second-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Since he had spare time now, he decided to sit cross-legged and absorb the comprehensions in his mind.

He had already obtained all of the secrets of the Genesis World, so with this as a foundation, deducing the Heavenly Venerable Seals became as easy as could be. In any case, this was simply a process of interacting with the fundamental power of the Genesis World.

In just three years, Ling Han opened his eyes again, revealing the dense array of symbols within them.

He was clearly sitting right there, yet Lin Luo and the others suddenly felt as if he were distant and unreachable. It was as if Ling Han had entered another realm.

Weng!

With a single thought, nine streams of symbols appeared on Ling Han’s body.

These were all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, from ninth-grade seals all the way to first-grade seals. Not a single one was missing.

Each seal was resonating with the others, and even though they were releasing energy, they were also absorbing energy at the same time. This was an endless cycle of growth and rejuvenation.

This was a perfect cycle, a complete system.

Ling Han came to some sort of understanding, and another thought in his mind caused the nine streams of symbols to fuse together again, transforming into a yin-yang diagram.

Yin, yang, life, death, positive, and negative—these things were opposing, yet they were also mutually enabling.

Ling Han tore open the void and casually snapped his fingers.

Peng!

A huge explosion instantly tore through the void, unleashing a petrifying destructive power.

This was the result of his power increasing 100,000-fold.

By channeling all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals and fusing them together, Ling Han was surprisingly able to increase his power 100,000-fold.

Pu!

Ling Han immediately spat a mouthful of blood. This power was far too immense, so much so that it placed a huge burden on Ling Han’s body. His Sixth Tier physique… was actually unable to withstand it.

Nearby, Lin Luo and the others were all wide-eyed with shock. The destructive power of this attack had been far too terrifying. Even they couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Would they genuinely be killed if they were struck by such an attack?

Perhaps their physical body would remain unharmed, but their mind would most likely be shattered into pieces.

Yet, Ling Han was still only at the Sixth Tier! How did he possess such unfathomable potential?

However, it was incredibly difficult for Ling Han to unleash such an attack. After all, his body had yet to become indestructible, so he was still unable to withstand the flow of such immense power.

“Ling Han, how do you feel?” everyone asked.

There was annoyance on Ling Han’s face. He hadn’t imagined that the problem wasn’t his power being insufficient, but instead his physique being too weak to withstand the shock.

Fortunately, the dimensions inside him all radiated with powerful life force. In just an instant, his slightly cracked skin had already healed and become as flawless as new.

Heavenly Venerates were detested by heaven and earth, so it was only natural that they wouldn’t be nurtured by heaven and earth. However, the dimensions inside Ling Han were also his cells at the same time. They were a part of him, so why wouldn’t they nurture him?

Unleashing such an attack indeed put a significant burden on his body. However, as long as it wasn’t too frequent, this was a burden that he could withstand.

“It’s time for the final battle!” Xin Fu announced. With his sharp sense as a Seventh Tier ultimate elite, he could already sense an overwhelming aura charging over and exuding an indescribably powerful might.

That was Hysteria, a being that had engulfed almost the entirety of the Genesis World. No one could imagine just how powerful it had become now.

Peng!

The earth shuddered, and the initially clear sky instantly became pitch black. Thankfully, they were all Heavenly Venerates, so they could see clearly even in absolute darkness.

Countless tentacles descended from the sky, bearing down on the entire Celestial Realm.

Hysteria had come. It wanted to engulf the final dimension and achieve its ultimate aim.

This was the Celestial Realm, the realm where Ling Han had begun his journey. And now, it was going to become the final battleground.

This was where everything had begun, and this was where everything would end.

“Charge!”

Ling Han and the others all charged forward, directly tearing open the void and leaping out of the dimension.

Looking down from the void, they could see an indescribably large octopus reaching out with its countless tentacles and encircling the entire Celestial Realm.

To provide a sense of scale, Hysteria was like a large mountain, while the Celestial Realm was nothing more than a small blade of grass on the mountain.

Ling Han and the others naturally wouldn’t stand there idly. They all charged forward and unleashed a barrage of furious attacks at Hysteria, attempting to stop it from engulfing the Celestial Realm.

“Huh? Why don’t you guys obediently shrink back into your shells like before? Wouldn’t that be nice?” Extermination said. She appeared before them with Chong Yan and the others.

She swept her gaze over them, and she discovered that there were four new helpers in Lin Youlian and the others. She couldn’t help but smile, and said, “Oh, so you’ve found yourself some new helpers. No wonder you dare to come over to challenge us.

“However, it’s not only you who has new helpers!”

She turned around, and said, “Come on out!”

Weng!

A figure walked over from extremely far away, radiating with a heaven-suppressing aura as he did so.

This was a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Another Seventh Tier ultimate elite had appeared in the world?

However, disbelief and deep astonishment spread across Ling Han’s face when he saw the appearance of this person.

Wang Quanhe.

This newly advanced Seventh Tier ultimate elite was actually Wang Quanhe.

How was this possible?

To say nothing else, just how many years had passed? How was it possible to raise someone from the Heavenly Body Tier to the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerable Tier in such a short span of time?

Moreover, Wang Quanhe’s cultivation talent could only be regarded as normal. If he were to cultivate by himself, it would be extremely difficult for him to even become a Celestial King, to say nothing of becoming a Heavenly Venerate, a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Now, however, Wang Quanhe was standing right before them, radiating with the formidable aura of a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. This was the reality.
