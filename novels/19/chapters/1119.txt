Chapter 1120: Learning from the Sword Strike

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han felt that if he were to die one day, he definitely wouldn’t set up so many trials and whatnot in his tomb.

He felt that it would make much more sense if the trials here were being used to select disciples for the Majestic Heaven Sect.

However, they weren’t, and they were instead trials left by a dead person.

‘Hmm? This Invincible Paragon Saint isn’t thinking of recruiting a disciple, is he?’

This was extremely likely. Otherwise, what was the point of setting up so many trials?

However, why couldn’t he say it straight up? There was almost no doubt that he was a Genesis Tier Saint. Even if he wasn’t, he was still at least an Eternal River Tier elite.

One had to realize that the Majestic Heaven Sect only had a single Eternal River Tier elite as well. However, even if it were only the Majestic Heaven Sect that was recruiting disciples and not he himself, all the young king tier prodigies in the neighboring galaxies were still especially eager.

Meanwhile, the situation here suggested that a Genesis Tier Saint was going to find a disciple after his death. People would definitely fight tooth and nail for this opportunity.

‘Hang on...’

Ling Han shook his head in his mind. If the Invincible Paragon Saint made his intentions clear, it was likely that the Heavenly Body Tier elites here would go around killing everyone else—if almost everyone else was dead, wouldn’t their chances of success increase significantly?

If a Genesis Tier Saint wanted to take a disciple, they naturally wouldn’t favor those at the Heavenly Body Tier over others. Instead, they would care more about one’s potential. In other words, they would try to find someone who was most suited to following their path.

Talent couldn’t represent everything. Different people would be suited to different paths.

Anyhow, the sword strike was especially simple, and everyone replicated its movements as they attempted to decipher a method to overcome it.

The sword strike didn’t possess any Origin Power when unleashed by the light-person, and thus one naturally couldn’t defeat this strike through brute strength. Instead, they had to defeat this strike using another strike.

When one felt that they could defeat the strike, they could head over to exchange strikes with the light-person. Whether or not they succeeded was naturally determined in a matter of seconds.

In addition, a layer of Primal Chaos would envelop both the light-person and the person that was attempting to decipher and overcome the sword strike. As a result, the others wouldn’t be able to see their exchange. If the person passed, they would be able to leave. If not, they would return to their original spot.

Because of this, the others couldn’t derive any help or copy patterns based on the process of the light-person’s exchanges.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the surroundings. There were truly a lot of Heavenly Body Tier elites. However, he didn’t see Empress Luan Xing. Perhaps she hadn’t come yet, or perhaps she had already deciphered this sword strike long ago and ascended to the fourth level.

It was a shame that there were so many watchful eyes. Otherwise, he could have entered the Black Tower with Shui Yanyu and completed comprehension under the Reincarnation Tree. One day was equivalent to one year, and he was confident that no one could possibly be faster than them.

Ling Han sighed in his mind. Even if he broke the time record and passed this trial with flying colors, his reward would still be a single Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill. It was useful, but not that useful.

‘Forget about it. I’ll just decipher it here.’

Ling Han focused his attention back on the sword strike. This strike drew on some Regulations of heaven and earth, making it appear remarkably profound.

He couldn’t learn this sword strike.

This wasn’t because his comprehension ability was weak, but rather because this sword strike drew on Regulations that far exceeded the Mountain River Tier.

Although he couldn’t learn it, this didn’t mean that he couldn’t decipher it. Otherwise, the Invincible Paragon Saint would have been giving them an impossible task.

However, this required time.

Ling Han mulled over the sword strike in his mind, and he couldn’t help but click his tongue in wonder. This strike was truly incredible. It suppressed its opponent using the power of the great dao—this was amazingly mysterious. He couldn’t learn this strike, but he could learn from its principles.

Sword of the Great Dao?

Enlightenment arose in his mind. If he combined the Sword of the Great Dao with his Fast Technique, how powerful would the might of the resulting sword technique be?

The Fast Technique destroyed the Regulations, while the Sword of the Great Dao adhered to the Regulations. It would be a pioneering feat if these two techniques could be combined.

This would be his own path!

Ling Han nodded in his mind. He had always wanted to create a technique that belonged to himself. However, achieving this was an extremely difficult task. Yet, right now, he finally saw a path before him. This allowed his comprehension to become clearer and more distinct.

‘Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!’

Ling Han ruminated over the sword strike in his mind. Right now, he wasn’t thinking about how to decipher it anymore. Rather, he was exploring the workings of this strike.

The more he understood it, the more enlightenment arose in his mind. This caused him to be beside himself with delight.

He lost all track of time. Some people successfully defeated the sword strike and left, while many others arrived and joined in on the deciphering. Many more people remained exactly where they were.

After heaven knew how long, Ling Han finally came to his senses after being tapped on the arm by Shui Yanyu. This seductive beauty was somewhat confident that she had deciphered the sword strike, and she was ready to head over to test herself against the light-person.

Meanwhile, Shui Yanyu found it strange that Ling Han still hadn’t gone over to challenge the light-person yet. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was extremely abnormal, and she was puzzled by it.

Only now did Ling Han realize that Shao Sisi, Du An, and the others had already left long ago. He was lagging far behind them.

“You go first,” he said with a smile. “I’ve reaped bigger rewards.”

Shui Yanyu’s eyes lit up, and she said, “You’re learning the sword technique?”

His wife was understanding him better and better. Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Yes, but also no. I’m figuring out the sword strike, but I’m not actually learning it. I’m simply learning from its principles.”

Shui Yanyu nodded in understanding. Just as she had thought, Ling Han’s comprehension ability was definitely no weaker than the other young king tier prodigies’.

“Then I’ll head over first,” she said.

“Sure!” Ling Han said with a nod.

Shui Yanyu went over to challenge the light-person. Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to succeed.

She wasn’t dispirited. She said, “I’m confident that I can decipher this strike in three more days.”

Ling Han nodded and continued to mull over the sword intent contained within the strike. He definitely couldn’t receive the reward for this trial, yet he didn’t care at all. This opportunity to explore the great dao of heaven and earth was far too precious and rare, and its value was countless times greater than that of the trial reward.

He lost track of time once again, and the people around him came and went. At some point in time, he finally stood up.

There was already nothing more that he could learn. After all, this was only a single strike. He could learn the rhythm of dao, but he couldn’t directly learn the Regulations of dao. In any case, he couldn’t grasp such kinds of Regulations anyway—they far exceeded his current cultivation level.

A confident smile spread across Ling Han’s face. He had already planted a seed in his mind, and there would eventually come a day when this seed sprouted and grew into a towering tree. When that time came, he would have forged a cultivation path that belonged to himself.

He went over to challenge the light-person.

The light-person wasn’t a genuine being; as such, it was completely emotionless. It immediately unleashed the sword strike at Ling Han.

Ling Han drew his Divine Demon Sword and replied with a strike of his own.

The tip of the light-person’s sword came to a stop before Ling Han’s neck, and Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword also came to a stop before the light-person’s neck.

After a brief pause, Ling Han suddenly felt his surroundings spin. He appeared in a completely new place.

He had passed the trial.

Ling Han clearly hadn’t thought about how to defeat the sword strike, yet strangely, the method to decipher and defeat it naturally came to his mind after he grasped the rhythm of dao that was contained within it.

“Hahahaha! Brat, you can’t ask me for a reward this time.” There was yet another stone tablet here, and it was from this stone tablet that the Invincible Paragon Saint’s voice traveled out. Right now, his voice was full of delight.

Ling Han had dissed him many times over the rewards for passing the trials. However, he had finally lost the right to a reward this time, and this made the Invincible Paragon Saint feel an evil sense of pleasure.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Yeah, I truly yearn for those alchemical pills... that’s right. Don’t tell me that the rewards for passing the fourth and fifth trials are also those pills?”

“Congratulations, you’re absolutely correct!” The Invincible Paragon Saint smiled, and said, “The best Purple Pattern Mountain River Pills can reach a quality of 10 stars. In other words, they can elevate one’s power by a maximum of 10 stars.”

Ling Han found this to be strange, and he asked, “If my power can already surpass five stars, won’t I obtain a power of 15 stars after ingesting a 10-star quality Purple Pattern Mountain River Pill?”
