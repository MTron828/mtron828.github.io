Chapter 3267: Hu Yang

Finally, with Lian Xuerong’s obstruction, the battle was stopped.

Tuoba Tianhuang left hatefully, and even gave Ling Han a disdainful look. He would teach Ling Han a lesson sooner or later.

As far as he was concerned, Ling Han was just a flash in the pan.

Look, he had already opened all twenty meridians and broken through to the Blood Transformation Tier, but what about Ling Han? He was still wandering around in the Meridian Opening Tier.

One had to know that the two of them had similar cultivation levels previously. They had both opened three Hidden Meridians.

The difference was obvious.

Thus, Tuoba Tianhuang no longer regarded Ling Han as a rival. All he wanted was to defeat Ling Han at the same cultivation level and completely erase the humiliation he had suffered back then.

Ling Han smiled faintly, completely unconcerned.

However, he originally thought that it would be very difficult for the two of them to interact again. In the end, they actually lived in the same area!

They would really be seeing a lot of each other.

‘Forget it, l’ll just beat him up. He’ll be obedient after I beat him up.

The academy arranged accommodations based on the time of entry, so those who lived in the same area may be either in Blood Transformation Tier or Meridian Opening Tier.

In the South Heart District, the people who lived here were basically seniors who had entered the academy three years ago.

“Brother Yang, the new students are settling in today. Should we quickly absorb them into the gang?” A man in green asked.

The person he was asking about was called Hu Yang, the leader of the Hu Clan. This Hu Clan corresponded to Hu Yunfeng, one of the three dukes of the imperial court. Although they were not as powerful as the Four Great Generals, Grand Tutor Hong, or the council chairperson, they were still in the second tier of authority and could not be underestimated.

Thus, the Hu Clan also formed their own faction, and did not rely on the Four Great Generals or Grand Tutor Hong. They had strong ambitions, and in the future, they would stand on equal footing with these elites.

Hu Yang nodded and said, “Although this group of people doesn’t have any background, being able to enter the academy means that their natural talent in martial arts is alright. They have some future prospects.”

“We’re not as good as the Vajra Gang and the Heaven Traversing Gang, after all. At the moment, we won’t consider quality. Expanding our forces is our top priority.”

“Let’s first show off our strength to those newbies and scare them. Then, we’ll recruit them into the gang. No one should dare to say no.”

“However, Brother Yang, there’s someone from the Hong Clan among the newcomers,” the green-robed man reminded.

A hint of fear flashed across Hu Yang’s eyes as well. He thought of that terrifying fellow. He had entered the academy at the age of 13, and at the age of Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

15, he had already become a celebrity in the academy. At the age of 19, he was already the number one elite in the academy, allowing the Hong Clan to be so strong that they occupied half of the academy’s territory.

Fortunately, this freakish cultivator had long advanced into the Extreme Bone Tier and left the academy. Otherwise, the academy would now be under the Hong Clan’s control, and no one would be able to contend with them.

“It doesn’t matter. We just need to not touch Hong Tianliang,” Hu Yang said. He paused for a moment and said, “Call all the brothers and let’s go.”

Compared to clans like the Four Great Generals, Grand Tutor Hong, and the Chairman of the Council, the Hu Clan could only be considered a newly risen force. Hu Yunfeng was still at the fifth step of the Extreme Bones and was working hard to break through to the Inscription Tier, striving to enter the top tier of power as soon as possible.

Correspondingly, Hu Yang also worked hard to expand the influence of the Hu Clan in the academy. This was because the future disciples of the academy would play a role in every corner of the Imperial Court. The role of middle-level officials was actually very important.

Hu Yang quickly gathered more than ten people, and they were basically all in the Blood Transformation Tier, while Hu Yang himself was in the Fifth Change of Blood Transformation Tier.

He was already thirty-five years old. Originally, if he had tried his best to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier, he would probably have already broken through. However, there was currently no one in the Hu Clan who could carry the flag after him, so he temporarily delayed the speed of his breakthrough and tried to stay in the academy for as long as possible.

Under his lead, more than ten people swaggered to the Green Clouds District.

This was where the new students lived. In the future, many new students would live here until this place was full.

“Newcomers, come out!” The man in green shouted. He was Hu Yang’s capable subordinate, Xu Youliang. His father was also Hu Yunfeng’s confidant and was a few years younger than Hu Yang.

If Hu Yang could no longer suppress his cultivation level and had to break through, he would temporarily carry the flag of the Hu Clan in the academy.

Xu Youliang was a Third Change cultivator. His roar shook the entire Green Clouds District.

“Who is it!” The new students walked out one after another. They thought that the academy was going to call them for another meeting.

Ten, thirty, seventy. More and more people came out. Most of them were very confused. Did something happen?

Xu Youliang didn’t wait for everyone to arrive. He said loudly, “This is Brother Yang, Hu Yang! Listen carefully. Brother Yang’s father is Lord Hu Yunfeng, one of the three dukes!”

Everyone was shocked. They might not have heard of Hu Yang, but it was naturally impossible that they would not know about Hu Yunfeng, one of the three dukes.

This was an important official of the Imperial Court, and an elite of Extreme Bone Tier.

“Newcomers, there are rules that you must abide by when you enter the academy!” Xu Youliang glanced around and saw that everyone’s faces were filled with reverence. He smiled and enjoyed such reverence very much.

“All of you, sit down!” He suddenly roared. The aura of a Third Change surged, instantly causing most people’s faces to turn pale.

Everyone sat down, but there were also many troublemakers who did not listen.

For example, Tuoba Tianhuang and Lian Xuerong were both in the Blood Transformation Tier—they were both in the Blood Transformation Tier, so who was afraid of who?

As for the Meridian Opening Tier, it was only Hong Tianliang and Ge Qiuling. Because Ling Han was still cultivating his Body Arts in the room, he pretended not to hear it. Instead, Huan Xue came out with the little pink pig in her arms. With her personality, she naturally wouldn’t resist.

Hong Tianliang revealed a look of disdain. The Hu Clan was nothing compared to the Hong Clan, and the Hu Clan was nothing in front of the Hong Clan.

He turned around and left.

Seeing that Hong Tianliang had left, someone also wanted to imitate him, but he was immediately beaten back. The man was indignant. “Why can he leave, but I can’t?”

“Because he’s Hong Tianliang!”

That one sentence shoved him back in.

“Oh, it seems like my words don’t work. There’s someone who is not able to listen!” Xu Youliang sneered and scanned an eye over Lian Xuerong, Tuoba Tianhuang and the others without getting angry.

He needed troublemakers to establish his might. This way, after he flattened these troublemakers, the others would naturally feel reverence. This might would be established.

“Boring!” Tuoba Tianhuang sneered and turned around.

Xu Youliang leaped out immediately and pounced towards Tuoba Tianhuang. When he was behind Tuoba Tianhuang, he spread his fingers and grabbed Tuoba Tianhuang’s shoulder.

“Scram!” Tuoba Tianhuang harrumphed coldly and turned around to slap. Boom! A terrifying power burst forth and the palm strike was both fast and ferocious.

BANG!

Xu Youliang was pushed back immediately while Tuoba Tianhuang staggered back as well.

“Eh?” Hu Yang’s eyes couldn’t help but light up. He had the information of every new student in his hands and it was naturally not difficult for him to obtain it with his abilities. That was why he knew that Tuoba Tianhuang had only just broken through to First Change.

It was not simple for a First Change to be comparable to a Third Change.

A prodigy!

He was definitely going to get this prodigy..
