Chapter 2113: Black Dragon King

“Old Bone Demon!” Xiao Gu said with enthusiasm. He always enjoyed finding a new person to mimic.

There was astonishing brilliance in the man’s eyes as he swept his gaze over Xiao Gu again and again. In the end, he sighed in sadness, saying, “So you’ve also died!”

“So you’ve also died,” Xiao Gu said with a sigh.

This was indeed correct. The Eternal Celestial King had indeed died several epochs ago. However, Ling Han and the others all knew that Xiao Gu was simply mimicking the man in green, so they couldn’t help but find this slightly amusing.

One of them was the remnant intent of a Celestial Tool, while one of them was simply a Celestial King Bone. When they sighed with emotion, Ling Han and the others couldn’t help but find it slightly strange.

The man in green squinted as he counted with his fingers. After a moment, he said, “So it’s already been this long.”

This was a dead person talking about how long he had already been dead. This was becoming stranger and stranger.

“Senior, you’ve already been dead for so long, so why don’t you give this bell to me?” Ling Han said.

Upon hearing this, Lu Hairong’s hair instantly stood on ends. She was given a huge fright.

This was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King! Even though he had already been dead for countless years, his might still existed! Thus, they had to treat him with utmost respect.

Yet, Ling Han actually dared to ask for his Celestial Tool?

He was truly courageous! He was also fairly shameless.

The man in green faltered for a moment before roaring with laughter. “I died countless years ago, and this wisp of aura is only a remnant intent that hasn’t dissipated yet. Now that I’ve awoken, this aura will dissipate in at most a dozen days. Fine, I’ll bestow this Bell of Time upon you.”

‘F*ck! He truly gave it away!’

Lu Hairong couldn’t help but feel slightly regretful. If she had known this, she would have definitely asked first. Even though the Bell of Time was damaged, it was still a Celestial Tool that had been forged by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. No matter what, it still possessed the might of seventh heaven or eighth heaven Celestial Kings.

“Young girl, you don’t possess such fortune, so there’s no need to feel regret,” the man in green said in an indifferent voice. It was as if he knew what Lu Hairong was thinking.

Lu Hairong couldn’t help but feel astounded. She was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King! Her emotions didn’t show on her face, yet before this man, she couldn’t hide them at all! His eyes were far too sharp!

“Huh? This young girl…” A look of realization spread across the man’s face as he gazed at Hu Niu, and he said, “You’re the seventh disciple of Brother Roc, correct? However, the symbol on your divine sense is damaged, and it seems neither human nor matter. You’re not the same person as before.”

As expected of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Nothing could escape his observation.

This was even though he was only a remnant intent!

“Senior, you sacrificed yourself while resisting the force of darkness, yet right now, the people from the force of darkness are still trying to extract the Source Power of heaven and earth from this continent. They want to damage the defenses of this heaven and earth. Senior, please help us!” Ling Han said with a bow.

They weren’t sure about the Black Dragon King’s cultivation, so what would they do if he were above the Fourth Heaven? If that were the case, Lu Hairong would simply be seeking death.

The man in green was the Eternal Celestial King’s remnant intent, so they might as well treat him as the Eternal Celestial King. Anger spread across his face, and he said, “These devils from the outside realm! They still haven’t given up yet!”

Boom!

Divine light exploded from his body, illuminating the entire void.

“Farewell, Senior!” Lu Hairong said with a bow. This was genuinely going to be the Eternal Celestial King’s final battle. Heaven and earth had their Regulations, and when one died, their dao would also vanish. This wisp of divine sense had only remained for several epochs thanks to the existence of the Celestial Tool. Once it unleashed its might, however, it would exhaust its power and vanish once and for all.

“Farewell, Senior!” Ling Han and the others also bowed respectfully.

The Celestial Kings who had battled to death here were all deserving of their utmost respect. They were worthy of being remembered forever.

“Farewell, Senior!” Xiao Gu said too. He mimicked what he saw.

The Eternal Celestial King was rendered speechless. While alive, he and Xiao Gu had shared the same status. Before they had achieved dao, Xiao Gu had even enjoyed a higher status than him. Now, however, Xiao Gu was actually referring to him as senior. This naturally made him feel extremely exasperated.

However, he wasn’t in the mood to reminisce with Xiao Gu right now. His final flames had already started to burn.

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly dashed over, bringing with them boundless darkness.

This was a woman who looked to be around 30 years old. Her figure was shapely, and her skin was smooth and jade-like. Her hair was tied into a bun, and as she looked over them, her gaze was as sharp as could be.

“So it’s just a few insects!” she said with a sneer. A black dragon rose behind her, brandishing its four claws and radiating with a terrifying aura.

‘Is this the Black Dragon King?’

There was no brilliant light around her, so it was impossible to determine her cultivation level.

“Bixi!” the Eternal Celestial King said with astonishment. “You actually didn’t die! Moreover, you’ve defected to darkness!”

Bixi!

Ling Han and the others were astounded upon hearing this. The first dragon in the world was called the Origin Dragon, and the Origin Dragon had given birth to nine children. The seventh was none other than Bixi.

However, they hadn’t imagined that Bixi was actually a female!

The Black Dragon King started to laugh in a wanton manner. This wasn’t an arrogant laugh, and it was instead a crazed laugh. She glared at the Eternal Celestial King with a baleful expression as she said, “When I was captured by Lord Mo Fu back then, which of you came to rescue me?

“To say nothing of you people, even my father abandoned me as if I were nothing! That being the case, why do I need to sacrifice myself for this world? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’m going to annihilate this world with my own hands!”

The Eternal Celestial King was extremely resolute, and he immediately charged forward upon hearing this. “Since that’s the case, I have nothing else to say to you.”

He didn’t utter any nonsense about dragging her back onto their side. First of all, her hate was far too deep-rooted, so she couldn’t be persuaded at all. Second of all, he didn’t have the time to do so.

Peng!

The Black Dragon King launched a punch, which transformed into a colossal dragon claw as it bore down on the Eternal Celestial King. A black lotus blossomed above the head of the dragon behind her, and it radiated with an extremely sinister aura.

16th Lotus!

Ling Han knew that the Ninth Lotus of this force corresponded to the Ascending Origin Tier. That being the case, what did the 16th Lotus correspond to?

Peng!

The attacks of the Eternal Celestial King and the Black Dragon King collided, causing both of them to shudder and retreat thousands of kilometers. However, with a single stride, they immediately charged forward and collided again, continuing their intense battle.

Peng, peng, peng!

The sound of their collisions was like torrential rain, and to everyone’s shock, the Black Dragon King wasn’t being suppressed at all!

“If you were still in your strongest state, I would indeed be no match for you. However, you’re merely a remnant divine sense at this moment, and you can only unleash the power of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. Even though I’m only a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, I possess the magnificent power bestowed upon me by Lord Mo Fu. Because of this, I’m no weaker than you!” the Black Dragon King said with pride.

“My physique is present, and my divine sense is also intact, meaning that I can battle like this forever. However, what about you? You’re at the end of your journey, and your power might vanish at any moment.”

The Eternal Celestial King didn’t reply. Instead, he simply attacked with his full might. With a roar, a semi-transparent blade appeared in his hands. This blade shone with the radiance of time.

He had formed this blade using the Regulations of Time. If one were struck, their body would be torn apart by the power of time. Some parts would be tossed 700 years into the past, while some parts might be thrown 100,000 years into the past. Some parts might even be sent back to three epochs ago.

His opponent wasn’t wrong. He indeed didn’t have long. Meanwhile, the Black Dragon King could still battle forever. This was an inherently unfair battle.

Ling Han’s heart thumped against his chest. He hadn’t imagined that the force of darkness would view this place with such great importance. They had deployed a 16th Lotus elite, one whose cultivation level could rival Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings and whose battle prowess could rival Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings.

It was commonly said that advancing to each level in the Celestial King Tier was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Just what kind of power had Lord Mo Fu bestowed upon the Black Dragon King? She could actually overcome the difference of one Heaven!

Was the force of darkness truly so terrifying?

Moreover, this would also entice many more people to descend into darkness.
