2998 Kill

“Me?” Ling Han was slightly surprised. “Why?”

“That’s because I don’t know that group of people at all. I only accidentally revealed that my surname is Ling, and I’m your grandson. In the end, they dissed me indiscriminately and started fighting with me,” Ling Feifan said. He appeared extremely curious, and he asked, “Old man, just how many enemies did you make in the past?”

This question… It seemed like Ling Han would have to ponder for a while before he could answer.

Ling Han stroked his chin, thought seriously for a while, and said, “I have killed the majority of those who have made an enemy of me, so there would not be any traces left behind.”

Alright, this answer was also quite domineering.

“Those people didn’t reveal their own identities?” Ling Han asked.

“No,” Ling Feifan replied. He then added, “I was too busy fighting, so I didn’t think to ask them.”

This battle was quite confusing. However, he really showed the bearing of the Ling Clan. “If you want a fight, I will oblige, and I will not cower in the slightest” is how it went.

Ling Han asked, “Why have you come here then? Calling for reinforcements?”

“I want to heal my injuries here; it’s safer.” Ling Feifan was quite strong-willed.

Ling Han nodded. “If you encounter someone that you are no match for, don’t force yourself. You can come to me.”

“Sure,” Ling Feifan replied. He then sat down in a cross-legged position and started to heal his wounds.

He looked extremely miserable, but in truth, those were only superficial injuries, and would recover in a few days. He then went out again. In that previous battle, he thought that he had suffered some loss, so he naturally had to get his revenge. The people of the Ling Clan were not the type to keep quiet after suffering a loss.

Ling Han ignored the matter. As long as Ling Feifan didn’t encounter any life-threatening dangers, he wouldn’t interfere.

Several days passed in this manner, and Ling Feifan came back with injuries again. However, there was a smug smile on his face. It was clear that he had made that group suffer even more serious injuries.

Another few days later, the situation was different.

Ling Feifan returned, but the moment he came in, he collapsed onto the ground, completely passing out.

A Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would actually lose consciousness?

Just how severely had he been wounded?

Ling Han couldn’t help but reveal a hint of anger.

If Ling Feifan had been fighting with Hysteria’s army, Ling Han would only feel heartache and not anger even if his arms and legs were broken. However, here with his “comrades,” his grandson had been beaten to such a state. This naturally enraged him immensely.

It was hard to imagine what kind of tough battle Ling Feifan had gone through. He had actually fought to the point of exhaustion.

Ling Han had not even stood up when he discovered a group of people walking over. Their target was his stone house.

Ling Han had been cultivating in seclusion all these days, and no one here had ever seen him before. Thus, these people definitely weren’t here to look for him, but rather for Ling Feifan. It was probably because they had seen Ling Feifan enter this place.

“Ling Feifan, get out here!” someone called out a challenge from outside.

Ling Han frowned. After so many years, how had the Realm Battlefield become so chaotic?

In the past, military discipline was strict, and private battles were prohibited. Those who disobeyed would be severely punished, but what was going on now? They actually dared to publicly charge to his doorstep.

“Coward, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Why are you afraid now?”

“If you’re scared, then get out here and kowtow three times. Then, say ‘those surnamed Ling are all bastards’ 100 times.”

“How could 100 times be enough? No matter what, it has to be 1,000 times, right?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hahahaha!”

Those people outside all broke out in a loud laughter, extremely arrogant.

Ling Han simply used his divine sense to scan the surroundings, and discovered that among these 24 people, only one was a First Tier, 22 were Second Tiers, and one was a Third Tier.

No wonder Ling Feifan had been completely exhausted from the battle. He wasn’t as freakish as Ling Han, so how could it not be like a cat toying with a mouse, resulting in him becoming completely exhausted?

Ling Han’s expression was very ugly. He wanted to destroy Hysteria, but did not have the noble aspiration to protect all life in the world—even if he did, that could only be ranked second on his list of priorities. What he truly wanted to protect was his family and friends.

Now that his grandson had been beaten so terribly, how could he still bear with it?

So what if he killed these bastards? With his current level, what did he have to be afraid of?

Worse come to worst, even if he didn’t have the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier, hadn’t he also dared to become hostile with a Seventh Tier and flip the table on them?

He stood up, opened the door, and slowly walked out.

“Yi, who is this person?”

“Tsk, he looks like he has a card up his sleeve. Just the look of him is so detestable.”

“Who does he think he is!”

Those people outside all spoke one after another. With Ling Han’s present height, his aura was withdrawn. If he did not take the initiative to unleash his might, aside from another Seventh Tier, who would be able to tell that he was extraordinary?

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them. He felt a sense of familiarity from these Heavenly Venerates.

He thought for a moment, and came to a sudden realization. These people were the marks of life that had been extracted from the bodies of Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the others. They were the seeds that had been preserved from the Genesis World of the last era.

Compared to how outstanding Feng Wuding was, the others naturally weren’t talented enough. More than 500 billion years had already passed, and they were only barely able to advance to the First Tier, Second Tier, or Third Tier.

However, Feng Wuding had been fully nurtured by Chong Yan and the others, so his rate of advancement was naturally very fast. Furthermore, he had indeed received some benefits from the Genesis World of the last era, which definitely far surpassed his peers.

“You were the ones who injured my grandson?” he asked calmly.

“That’s your grandson?” Those people snickered. “So what? We will beat even you into a grandson[1]!”

“All right!” Ling Han nodded. These people were unreasonably starting a fight with Ling Feifan, bullying Ling Feifan with an advantage in numbers, and now they even brought out a Third Tier, forcing Ling Feifan into such dire straits, which filled Ling Han with fury.

He did not care what the reason was. Since you guys liked to use violence, then he would just use violence to solve the problem.

“What’s so ‘all right’ about it? Want to be my grandson?” someone snickered.

Peng, Ling Han threw a punch, and this person was turned into a mist of blood.

Second Tier?

He was nothing but trash.

Instantly, the area fell silent, becoming deathly silent.

A Second Tier actually died just like that?

Though they had forced Ling Feifan to the point of exhaustion, they still didn’t dare to kill him. After all, this was the Realm Battlefield, so they needed everyone to unite and face the enemy together.

Killing their own people?

No one could afford to bear such a terrible reputation.

But when Ling Han moved, he was clean, swift, and without the slightest hesitation. He had killed the opponent with a single punch, as if that was not a Second Tier, but rather an insignificant piece of trash.

Hiss, this was too brazen, wasn’t it?

Moreover, he had killed a Second Tier with a single punch; what kind of concept was that?

He had to possess Third-Tier strength, at least!

Everyone was naturally terrified, fearing that Ling Han would kill again, and aside from the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate among them, who could match him?

“What is it? Why is there no noise now?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“Y-y-you are really too bold, to actually dare commit murder in the base camp!”

“Who exactly are you?”

They mustered up the courage to ask this question because that Third Tier was already standing in front of them, which gave them courage.

[1] Very demeaning, meaning that they would beat him into complete submission.
