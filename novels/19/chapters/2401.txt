Chapter 2402: Complete victory

Xie Yangbing knew that his strength was limited to the Eighth Refinement. If he proceeded to do the Ninth Refinement, the only path before him would definitely be failure, and the alchemical pill would explode.

If their accomplishments in Spirit Refinement were equal, then Ling Han would be able to defeat him with the difficulty level of concoction of the alchemical pill.

He still held a sliver of hope, and that was his skill in Spirit Refinement surpassed Ling Han.

But very soon, he paled in shock because Ling Han had not stopped, but rather continued Spirit Refinement.

The Ninth Refinement!

Xie Yangbing could not believe it; Ling Han was actually capable of Ninth Refinement?

No, no, no, there was no way he could succeed!

Xie Yangbing thought fervently. If he forcefully attempted Ninth Refinement, it would only result in the pill exploding. In that case, his victory was assured.

Haha, not bad, not bad.

He withdrew his hands, and stood watching from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Ling Han began the Ninth Refinement, and with the time acceleration effects, a day passed in the snap of a finger. He finished and stood up, and did not continue with the Tenth Refinement. In any case, he was definitely winning, and had fully established the image of his invincible might in the hearts of the residents of Alchemy City.

“Chairperson is mighty!”

“Chairperson is imperious!”

“Chairperson is invincible!”

Everyone cheered. Ling Han had an absolutely crushing advantage over his opponent. Furthermore, what kind of concept was the Ninth Refinement? One more step further, and Ling Han would be capable of becoming a Five-Star Grandmaster.

This was far too astonishing.

Xie Yangbing was completely dejected. He had actually lost to Ling Han, someone who was even younger than him.

Meanwhile, Qian Wuyi revealed his killing intent. No matter how strong Ling Han was in alchemy, so what? This was a world of cultivators, after all. As long as he got rid of Ling Han, Xie Yangbing could still ascend to the position of chairperson.

He was just about to make his move when he saw that Ling Han actually just happened to cast a glance at him.

“Don’t court death!” Ling Han stated camly, a flash of killing intent flickering in his eyes.

Qian Wuyi felt a chill that caused all the bones in his body to feel like they were frozen. This glance, this killing intent was really too terrifying, making him feel like he was facing an invincible Celestial King.

However, he immediately pepped himself up. Ling Han was just a mere Small Accomplishment Ascending Origin Tier, so how could he be a match for him? Even if the other party had a grasp of Regulations of Time, so what? With a gap of two minor levels, how could that possibly affect him?

On the other hand, as long as he flooded the whole area with the power of Regulation, Ling Han would not be able to draw on the Regulations of Time, so even if the Regulations of Time was supreme over all other Regulations, so what?

He instantly became more daring, and his right hand’s fingers formed claws. The power of Regulation was gathering. It was one thing if he did not make a move, but if he did, it would be a powerful strike. He was planning to kill Ling Han in a single stroke.

Ling Han smirked coldly. He was naturally able to discover Qian Wuyi’s dirty trick.

This old wretch was really seeking his own death.

“Young man, you are too arrogant!” Qian Wuyi moved aggressively.?Boom, endless fiery waves spread out as he laughed loudly. His right hand seemed to have formed the claws of a giant beast from the primitive era as he grabbed out at Ling Han.

“Not good!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng and the others all stood up. Ling Han’s skill in alchemy was practically off the charts, but his cultivation level was only at the Small Accomplishment level of the Ascending Origin Tier. The gap between him and Qian Wuyi was really too wide.

And this was a sudden strike from Qian Wuyi at that, and also a powerful move that he had planned long in advance. How could it not be extremely strong and powerful?

Ling Han merely smiled faintly as his right hand balled into a fist. Frightening physical power built up. This was the most basic power of a Genesis World, and was superior to Regulations. Though he could not use it directly, and could only use it in the form of brute force, it was already enough.

Boom, he brandished his fist, and struck out at Qian Wuyi.

Peng!

Ling Han’s fist was like a hot knife cutting through butter. Qian Wuyi’s massive claws shattered at the first contact, which also caused Qian Wuyi to grunt lowly. His right hand was covered entirely with blood. However, Ling Han’s fist did not look like it was going to stop, and was still flying towards Qian Wuyi. It was as if even if there was a great star ahead, it would still be turned into dust by the force of this punch.

Qian Wuyi’s expression changed drastically. He finally knew that the previous feeling of terror that he had experienced was not a misconception, but rather that this young man was truly terrifyingly strong.

He hurriedly bounced back in retreat, but how could he possibly be Ling Han’s match in terms of explosive power?

Ling Han caught up with him, and sent out his fists in a barrage of punches. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

It was just a mere three punches, and Qian Wuyi’s shield of defensive Origin Power crumbled completely. Then, Qian Wuyi could only throw up blood as he was entirely and forcefully pummeled into mush.

Actually, Ling Han was very good-tempered. As long as no one trifled with him, he would also be very amicable, but if anyone dared to trifle with him, he would also retaliate and beat him to the point of throwing up blood and breaking bones, and since Qian Wuyi wanted to kill him, he naturally could only pay him back.

Everyone was grabbing their heads in shock. Just what had they witnessed?

A consummate level Ascending Origin Tier elite had actually been beaten to death by a barrage of punches from Ling Han!

‘F*ck!’

Who could believe this?

But only an instant later, everyone erupted in a tsunami wave of cheering.

Too strong, their chairperson was truly too strong. His natural talent in alchemy was unmatched, and he was about to advance into the ranks of Five-Star Grandmasters, and his strength in cultivation was also world-shaking.

He had beaten a great consummate level Ascending Origin Tier until the latter burst with just a few punches. This was practically comparable to a Celestial King’s power.

Ling Han turned to look at Xie Yangbing, a faint smile curling up the corners of his lips.

Xie Yangbing was completely dejected, and his expression was ashen. How could there be such a freak in this world? Reaching heights that others could not even look up to in both cultivation and alchemy?

However, why was the other’s gaze so frightening!

Ling Han laughed. “Since you like this place so much, you should just stay here from now onwards, and concoct alchemical pills for me every day.”

Xie Yangbing couldn’t help but nod. Though Ling Han was smiling, he could only feel an endless chill. If he said one word in refusal, he would probably be pulverized instantly.

Ling Han patted Xie Yangbing’s shoulder. “That’s right. Since we are kindred spirits, we should help each other.”

Xie Yangbing forced a grin, yet it looked even worse than a smile. He was nodding repeatedly, yet was cursing Ling Han violently in his mind. If he was strong enough, he would definitely destroy Ling Han.

Ling Han’s words suddenly changed. “Right, exactly why have so many waves of your people come here?”

“Nothing much, we just wanted to expand our territory,” Xie Yangbing quickly answered.

Ling Han patted his shoulder again. “Misbehaving again?”

There were indeed some gains to be had in the Eastern Celestial Realm, but it could not compare to the Western Celestial Realm at all. Furthermore, the boundless seas separated them, and the journey to and forth was extremely inconvenient unless they were planning to permanently settle here. Even if Xie Yangbing conquered Alchemy City, he would be very soon overthrown.

Xie Yangbing continued to shake his head. “We really just wanted to rake in some treasures and resources.”

Ling Han cracked a grin. “Looks like I can only search your soul.”

Xie Yangbing instantly paled in shock. With a soul search, not only would he reveal all the secrets of his lifetime, it would also endanger his life, or he would basically become a retard.

“Don’t make me wait too long,” Ling Han stated.

Xie Yangbing hesitated for a while, and then finally replied, “It is rumored that there is an ancient pill recipe hidden somewhere in Alchemy City.”

“What ancient pill recipe?” Ling Han asked.

“It’s called the Celestial King Pill,” Xie Yangbing immediately revealed without any further hesitation.

“Celestial King Pill?” Ling Han asked smilingly. “Could it be that one would directly become a Celestial King after consuming it?”

“That’s right.” Unexpectedly, Xie Yangbing really nodded.

At this, even Ling Han became solemn. There actually was such an amazing alchemical pill in this world that consuming one would allow one to directly leap into Celestial King Tier?

No wonder there were still people endlessly coming here from the Western Celestial Realm even with how high their standards of alchemy were. The value of this pill recipe was really too high.
