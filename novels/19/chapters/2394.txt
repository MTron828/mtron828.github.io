Chapter 2395: Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate

Heaven and earth couldn’t tolerate Heavenly Venerates. After so long, why could the Foreign Realm still not defeat the Celestial Realm? This was because the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm was the most powerful weapon. Otherwise, the elites from the Foreign Realm would have charged over long ago.

Thus, once the final transcendent dimension was engulfed by Hysteria, the supreme elites from that dimension would have no other place to settle. At that time, how could they fight against Hysteria?

Right now, even the Genesis World had been forced to link the dimensions together. It had activated the Realm Wars, and was attempting to create more transcendent dimensions. It was abundantly clear just how terrifying Hysteria was.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate remained silent. The aim of her, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, and the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was simply to become transcendent beings, beings who were free from the restrictions of this heaven and earth. They wanted the freedom to travel through the dimensions without any restrictions.

However, after listening to Zhou Heng…

‘F*ck!’

Were they genuinely transcendent?

Once Hysteria charged over, all of the dimensions would be destroyed!

The transcendence of Heavenly Venerates simply allowed them to break free from the restrictions of their dimension. They could reside in any dimension without worrying about their strength being weakened. However, if the dimensions all disappeared, Heavenly Venerates would also be rendered useless.

That being the case, what transcendence would they enjoy?

Ling Han’s expression was solemn. He hadn’t imagined that the situation was so grave.

In comparison, the invasion by the Foreign Realm truly seemed insignificant.

“Lord, so you’ve come over to nurture more elites to fight against Hysteria?” Ling Han asked.

Zhou Heng nodded, and said, “Right now, we’ve stopped Hysteria outside the final transcendent dimension. However, our casualty numbers are too great, so we need more fresh reinforcements. As such, I’m traveling through the dimensions in search of prodigies to bring back to the transcendent dimension to nurture.”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “I won’t force anyone, but I still hope that those who are prodigious will follow me to the front lines. Otherwise, once the transcendent dimension falls to Hysteria, everything will transform into void.”

Boom!

Right at this moment, a colossal tentacle suddenly materialized in the air, slamming down at the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate and the others.

This tentacle was pitch-black, and it was covered in numerous indescribable symbols. Its appearance instantly triggered wails of grief from heaven and earth. A corner of heaven and earth was forcefully torn apart, leading to an endless deluge of bloody rain. It was as if heaven and earth were about to collapse.

“Damn it!” Zhou Heng’s expression changed drastically. He reached out with his right hand, and a sword had already appeared in his hand at some time. With a single slash, heaven and earth were shaken.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate also gave a shout as she pushed her palms out, summoning a wave of boundless flames.

Peng!

The tentacle slammed down, and the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate was ruthlessly sent flying. Meanwhile, Zhou Heng barely managed to dash over in time, swinging his sword and slashing at the tentacle.

Pu!

The sword hacked into the tentacle, yet no blood sprayed into the air. Instead, the tentacle shuddered lightly before transforming into bubbles and vanishing without a trace.

“This is a spiritual mark of Hysteria. It most likely discovered the dimension coordinates of this place as well, so it followed me here. Fortunately, this dimension beacon has already been destroyed. Hysteria can’t come here again.” Zhou Heng sheathed his sword as he spoke. He then looked toward the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate was in an extremely miserable state. After facing an attack head-on, her chest had directly caved in.

She picked herself up with great difficulty.

Boom!

Flames enveloped her, and her wounds started to slowly heal.

A cold chill gripped the hearts of Ling Han and the others. The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate had actually been severely wounded in a single strike! One had to realize that the tentacle had only been a spiritual mark of Hysteria!

Just how great was the gulf between their respective power?

Ling Han then looked at Zhou Heng. This person was most likely even more powerful than Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. Otherwise, he couldn’t have exterminated Hysteria’s spiritual mark.

Zhou Heng smiled at Ling Han, and said, “The Heavenly Venerable Tier is divided into seven minor tiers. I’m a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.”

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han and the others were rendered speechless. No wonder this person was so powerful. He was actually a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate! One had to realize that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was only at the peak stage of the First Tier, yet he could already rival the team of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. That being the case, just how powerful was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate?

“Then what about Hysteria?” Ling Han asked in curiosity.

“Hysteria reached the peak stage of the Seventh Tier long ago. Now, it’s transformed into a dimension itself, so it’s already pointless to measure its power in terms of the Heavenly Venerable Tier,” Zhou Heng pondered for a moment before replying.

In other words, it was even more powerful than Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. This was quite understandable. Otherwise, it couldn’t have destroyed three transcendent dimensions.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate’s wounds still had yet to fully recover. However, she turned around, and said, “I’ve decided. I’m going to follow you to the transcendent dimension.”

In this dimension, she had almost reached the peak of her potential already. It was almost impossible to take another step forward. Of course, this was unless the Celestial Realm crumbled and she absorbed the essence power of heaven and earth. Only so could she possibly advance to the Second Tier and realize transcendence.

However, this was only a possibility. Moreover, Hysteria was so petrifying, so it was hard to say whether she could ever see this day. Finally, the transcendent dimension could nurture Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, so she would naturally have a better environment to develop if she went there.

Zhou Heng nodded in delight, saying, “I can sense three other Heavenly Venerates in this dimension. These are all potential allies to recruit. Also, young people like this are our hope for the future. I can only come once, so I need to take everyone who wants to go together.”

The transcendent dimension definitely had something like a dimension beacon that could guide him back.

“Let’s go together.” Zhou Heng reached forward, and drew Ling Han and the others into his sleeve. Of course, he didn’t draw the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate into his sleeve. Even though she was weaker than him, she was still a Heavenly Venerate, after all.

Those who could reach this cultivation were all paramount prodigies.

With a slash of his sword, Zhou Heng sliced apart the void. He immediately stepped in. After hesitating for a brief moment, the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate also stepped in after him.

Heavenly Venerates were far too powerful. A split second after stepping into the void, Zhou Heng had already stepped out.

They arrived before a tall mountain. There was a palace atop this mountain, and with their powerful vision, they could all clearly see the words “Sealed Emotion Palace.” It exuded an aura of undying eternity.

Zhou Heng shook his sleeve, and everyone landed on the ground. He shook his sleeves again, and his aura as a Heavenly Venerate also vanished. This was to avoid being targeted by heaven and earth. As a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, if he unleashed his full power, the only fate of the Celestial Realm would be destruction.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate also arrived. Upon seeing Zhou Heng suppress his aura, she was also too embarrassed to show off her own cultivation. After all, even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate was being so modest. She suppressed her aura, yet she was nowhere near as able as Zhou Heng. She could only maintain this suppression for a short amount of time before being targeted by heaven and earth again. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

They headed toward the mountain peak.

Someone leaped over, and roared, “Impudence!” This person blocked their path.

This was a youth at the Ascending Origin Tier. He clearly didn’t recognize the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate, and he more so couldn’t recognize Zhou Heng. However, he was extremely familiar with Ling Han. He immediately yelped, “Ling Han!”

He was extremely astonished. A measly Ascending Origin Tier elite actually dared to barge into the residence of a Heavenly Venerate? Had he eaten the courage of a dragon?

However, Ling Han had someone backing him, so he was naturally brimming with confidence. “I’m accompanying two seniors over, so please help me request a meeting with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.”

The young man exploded with rage. Ling Han actually dared to speak so wantonly?

This was a Heavenly Venerate! Was this someone who could be called over on a whim? Also, what did he mean “accompanying two seniors”? He didn’t recognize either of them! At the most, they were only at the Celestial King Tier. Yet, they wanted an audience with the Heavenly Venerate? Were they dreaming?

“Very well! You actually dare to barge into the Sealed Emotion Palace! Don’t even think about leaving in one piece!” he said in a menacing voice.

Ling Han chuckled in his mind. He had naturally laid a trap for this person. Otherwise, he could have directly announced the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate’s title.

Zhou Heng glanced at him, and a faint smile surprisingly tugged at his lips. He showed no signs of wanting to chide Ling Han.

Ling Han knew that this person had most likely been playful in his youth as well. Thus, he allowed him to cause a ruckus here.
