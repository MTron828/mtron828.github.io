Chapter 2396: Sealed Emotion Palace

The youth from the Sealed Emotion Palace unleashed a long bellow, and two powerful elites quickly rushed over to meet them. Colorful light hovered around their bodies.

They were Celestial Kings!

One was at the Third Heaven, while the other was at the Fifth Heaven. They were fairly powerful beings.

The two Celestial Kings first looked Ling Han and the others up and down. They were naturally searching for Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. He was far too terrifying, and he had truly made a fearsome name for himself in that battle.

Mm-hm, he wasn’t here.

The two Celestial Kings breathed a sigh of relief. As long as he wasn’t here, everything would be fine.

The Third Heaven Celestial King flashed a menacing smile as he looked at Ling Han, saying, “Ling Han, just because Heavenly Venerate Wu Le made an announcement, you think you can act as you please? You actually dare to barge into the Sealed Emotion Palace? You’re seeking death!”

Under normal circumstances, no one would dare to disobey the command of a Heavenly Venerate. However, Ling Han had actually barged into the Sealed Emotion Palace by himself. If they didn’t kill him, wouldn’t that be a blight on the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s name?

This was their bottom line, one that couldn’t be crossed.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’m accompanying two lords over. They have something important to discuss with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. Aren’t you going to hurry up and report this matter?”

“Impudence!” the Third Heaven Celestial King roared in anger. He reached over to grab Ling Han. He didn’t dare to kill Ling Han, but he didn’t mind capturing this brat and handing him over to the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable to deal with.

“Why don’t we all calm down? There’s no need for violence, is there?” Zhou Heng said with a faint smile. He reached over and lightly grabbed the Third Heaven Celestial King’s wrist.

The Third Heaven Celestial King faltered for a brief moment. An expression of disbelief then spread across his face.

He hadn’t noticed this person’s movement at all!

Gasp!

Just how great was the gulf in power between them?

The Fifth Heaven Celestial King was also astounded. Zhou Heng hadn’t exuded any aura of dominance at all. Yet, his movement was actually so astonishing and powerful. He was unable to believe this; he was unable to fathom this.

This kind of power was even superior to his.

He hurriedly sent a signal to call for even more powerful reinforcements.

Coincidentally, the most powerful member of the Sealed Emotion Lineage was present today.

The Imperial Void Celestial King!

In no time, a terrifying aura surged over, bringing with it a paramount elite.

This was the Imperial Void Celestial King, essentially the most powerful person under the level of Heavenly Venerate.

“Ling Han!” the Imperial Void Celestial King exclaimed, his pupils contracting. This measly Ascending Origin Tier elite had even caused headaches to a mighty Heavenly Venerate. Ling Han was definitely one of a kind, and also the first of his kind. Moreover, he had also failed to obtain the Origin Magic Cube from Ling Han at that time. This was something that continued to linger on his mind, troubling him greatly.

To be remembered by so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings and even Heavenly Venerates… Ling Han was definitely one of a kind.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was just about to unleash his might, yet he instantly faltered when he swept his gaze across the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Others might not recognize the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate, but that was because they didn’t have the right to recognize her. However, as the most outstanding disciple of the Sealed Emotion Lineage, how could he not recognize this paramount elite? He hurriedly bowed with respect, and said, “My respects to Lord Green Flames!”

Pu!

The two Celestial Kings instantly choked and spluttered upon hearing this.

‘What?! That young girl is actually the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate?!

‘What in the world is going on? Isn’t the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate allied with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate? Why is she now standing with Ling Han?’

It was naturally beneath the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate to explain herself. In fact, she even ignored the Imperial Void Celestial King. In any case, it was Zhou Heng’s words that counted.

The hearts of the Imperial Void Celestial King and the others jolted upon seeing the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate’s attitude. Perhaps she had defected to the side of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le?

One had to realize that the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had to team up if they wanted to rival Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. That being the case, the choice of the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate would decide the victor. Whichever side she supported was whichever side would gain the upper hand.

The two Celestial Kings hurriedly kneeled down, and said, “Our respects to Lord Green Flames!” They weren’t as powerful and domineering as the Imperial Void Celestial King, so they naturally didn’t dare to only bow. They fell to their knees and paid grand respects.

The youth was also scared out of his skin. He had actually dared to shout at a Heavenly Venerate! Had he grown tired of living?!

He prostrated himself, offering his most sincere apology to the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate finally spoke, saying, “Sealed Emotion, get over here!”

“Haha, why didn’t you warn me about your visit, Green Flames? That way, I could have prepared some tea and snacks to welcome you.” There was a long laugh as the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable appeared. His appearance was handsome, yet his expression was cold and emotionless.

The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate humphed, pointing at Zhou Heng and saying, “It’s him who wants to talk to you, not me.”

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was astonished. Judging from her tone, the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate was seemingly filled with apprehension toward this man. However, one had to realize that there had only been three Heavenly Venerates in the Celestial Realm. Now, there were four. However, there was no fifth person.

What did a Heavenly Venerate need to be afraid of?

He trained his gaze on Zhou Heng. There was confusion in his eyes because he truly couldn’t see anything special about Zhou Heng. He was as ordinary as could be.

The Imperial Void Celestial King stepped forward, and said, “Friend, who are you? If there’s anything you want to discuss, you can discuss it with me.”

If he allowed a Celestial King to directly converse with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, wouldn’t that be devaluing the Heavenly Venerate’s face? Thus, as his disciple, he had to step forward.

Ling Han also stepped forward. If a Celestial King didn’t have the right to converse with a Heavenly Venerate, then the Imperial Void Celestial King more so didn’t have a right to converse with Zhou Heng, no?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Imperial Void, how can you show such disrespect before Senior Zhou?”

The Imperial Void Celestial King was incensed. A measly Ascending Origin Tier cultivator actually dared to utter his name without honorifics? To say nothing of Ling Han, most Celestial Kings would have to respectfully refer to him as Lord Imperial Void when they saw him.

There were Nine Heavens in the Celestial King Tier, and each step forward was as difficult as ascending the heavens. This was not a mere joke.

“I’ll teach you a lesson on the behalf of Lord Wu Le!” the Imperial Void Celestial King said. He reached over to grab at Ling Han. He had to punish this brat no matter what.

Zhou Heng smiled faintly. His eyes widened slightly, and a burst of sword intent burst forth, carrying with it a paramount aura. Heaven and earth instantly replied, with thunder rumbling and a tribulation forming to erase his existence.

The color drained from the face of the Imperial Void Celestial King. This was definitely the might of a Heavenly Venerate!

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!

‘Since when did a fifth Heavenly Venerate appear in the Celestial Realm? Holy f*ck! Perhaps Ling Han is the representative of Heavenly Venerates? Whenever he appears, he’s always bringing a Heavenly Venerate with him!’

“Friend, please calm down!” the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable hurriedly said. He reached over to block Zhou Heng’s attack.

Peng!

The two mighty Heavenly Venerates exchanged a strike. Zhou Heng smiled faintly, and quickly suppressed his aura as a Heavenly Venerate. He became indiscernible from an ordinary person.

Meanwhile, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable stumbled back in retreat. With each step that he retreated, heaven and earth would groan as if it were about to crumble, unable to endure this force.

The Imperial Void Celestial King and the others were stunned upon seeing this. They all trembled in fear.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had actually been defeated!

He hadn’t merely suffered a small disadvantage. Rather, he was completely inferior to this person. The gulf between them was far too great.

Gasp!

Not long ago, there was Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. Now, there was also this person. Were they trying to defy the heavens?

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s expression also changed drastically. He calmed himself down, and asked, “Friend, you are?”

“I’m Zhou Heng,” Zhou Heng replied in modesty. However, being overly modest was sometimes an act of arrogance. This was especially the case since he had already revealed his devastating power.

“Friend Zhou is a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate,” the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate finally said. However, her words almost frightened everyone to death.

Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate!

This kind of elite would be invincible even if they went to the Foreign Realm. In fact, they could even destroy the entire Foreign Realm if they wanted. They were genuinely paramount and transcendent beings.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was both stunned and confused. How could such a being be born in the Celestial Realm?

This super low-level dimension couldn’t sustain such a being at all!
