Chapter 828: Surprise Reinforcements

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After exchanging greetings, the Sword King immediately displayed his might, unleashing a sword strike. It was precisely the 10,000 Techniques Return to One, which condensed into a three-hundred-meter long Sword Ray, slashing towards the Lunar King.

The Lunar King, however, seemed totally unconcerned, reaching out with her hand and grabbing Sword King’s Sword Ray. She clenched it, and pa , the Sword Ray instantly shattered, turning into endless pieces and falling down. She nodded, and said, “Your talent isn’t bad. After reaching the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, cultivating arduously for another hundred years to increase battle prowess, you can attempt to reach fifteen stars of battle prowess.”

This was a very high evaluation—at least up till now, fifteen stars Shattering Void Tier was the strongest battle prowess.

... Ma Duo Bao hadn’t truly showed his hand, while Helian Tianyun was glory from countless years ago, and at most only returned to the Spiritual Infant Tier by now.

Ling Han acknowledged it on the inside. Those who were able to comprehend the heart of martial arts were definitely exceptional talents, and were definitely impressive in battles at the same tier.

The Sword King didn’t reply. He had become well known long ago, being the finest elite in the world to begin with, but now, despite it being a compliment, how could he possibly be glad about being treated like a junior?

He swung his sword, the Sword Qi imposing, shining over the world; even heaven and earth paled, and only his sword danced between heaven and earth as if it could split even them.

Powerful, he was really powerful!

Unfortunately, his opponent was the Lunar King.

Four stars of a gap in strength wasn’t something that any effort and imposing manner could change. The Lunar King casually swatted the sword lights that came assaulting her, easily extinguishing them.

After exchanging about a hundred moves, the Lunar King finally got serious, and shot the Sword King down from the sky with a single slap, making him lose battle power completely.

The first battle: Purple Moon Empire won!

This time, it was Purple Moon Empire’s turn to send someone out to battle.

The Flame King took the field, while the other side sent the Azure Phoenix Divine Empress.

The Azure Phoenix Divine Empress was unexpectedly the first to reach the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, her normal battle prowess reaching eleven stars, and she also had the advantage of her bloodline—as her wings spread, her battle prowess rocketed to thirteen stars.

This was extremely terrifying—she could run over the north sea’s royal clan by herself. However, against the Flame King, this wasn’t enough, and soon she was defeated, adding a second defeat to the five great sects’ side.

Ling Han had thought that the five sects would send out some mysterious expert in the second round. For example, an elite from the sea tribe—their imperial clan might have supreme elites of fifteen stars. But, by the looks of it now, the other party seemed to have given up.

This was completely off. The five great sects had deep roots in the divine realm, so how could they surrender so easily?

There was definitely something off!

Ling Han spread out his divine sense in attempt to find out whether the five great sects were taking advantage of the situation to lay down a killing formation, only using the wager to buy time and in reality attempting to kill them all in one go.

“They didn’t tamper with anything,” Ma Duo Bao said. He also had a puzzled look.

Ling Han obviously trusted his judgement. Although Ma Duo Bao had almost never displayed his strength, Ling Han believed that Ma Duo Bao was definitely the world’s number one expert at the current stage—the one and only!

In the future, Helian Tianyun should be able to compare against Ma Duobao, and after he himself advanced to the Shattering Void Tier, he wouldn’t fear the enemies, either—even Black Tower’s power boost could allow him to win instantly!

But now, Ma Duo Bao was definitely the world’s strongest, and since he said there was no ambush, then there definitely was no ambush.

Soon, two more battles were over. The Heavenly Astral King and the Grand Water King each added a victory to Purple Moon Empire.

Now, once the five sects lost one more match, there’d be no need to fight anymore, as they would’ve lost five matches.

Was it really that easy?

“Hehe, it’s come to the fifth match that quickly!” The old man from previously coughed, and said, “Zuo Qifang, you take this match.”

The crowd separated as a youngster walked out.

He was truly young; his blood and Qi were vigorous like a furnace, soaring straight into sky—the relative age definitely wouldn’t surpass twenty, the stage when the body was growing. So even if he was in the Shattering Void Tier, he would be at most two hundred years old.

And this youngster was really in the Shattering Void Tier!

“This humble one is Zuo Qifang!” The youngster walked with his hands behind his back, appearing extremely nonchalant. “I’m nineteen this year.”

Those words were enough to see his pride—or else, why announce his age? I was a Shattering Void Tier elite at nineteen; if I wasn’t impressive, who was?

Ling Han, Ma Duo Bao, and the eight kings all revealed shocked looks. A nineteen-year-old Shattering Void Tier elite was too ridiculous! Ling Han was walking down the old route again, but he was almost 21 years old now, and still hadn’t returned to the Heaven Tier, and there was at least two to three years time before he’d reach the Shattering Void Tier.

However, Ling Han’s speed was already more than fast enough; he was even suppressing his own cultivation to avoid unstable foundations, which would influence his progress in the future.

A nineteen-year-old Shattering Void Tier elite? What the hell!?

How much spirit medicine did he take to achieve it? Such a Shattering Void Tier was definitely a paper tiger, and anyone at the first layer of the Shattering Void Tier could defeat him.

Ma Duobao stared at Zuo Qifang; after a while, his expression became extremely stern as he said, “This person’s in the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier and is very, very strong!”

Even he used two “very,” so it could be seen how cautious he was.

The eight kings were all shocked. Although it was a bit hard to accept that that Zuo Qifang was such a young Shattering Void Tier elite, there indeed was some divine medicine that allowed people to reach the heavens in a single bound. However, going from the first layer of the Shattering Void Tier to the ninth layer... several tens of years wouldn’t be long at all.

A nineteen-year-old boy in the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, this was truly surprising.

Who could compare against him?

Probably only Hu Niu—she was only one step away from the Shattering Void Tier. With her freakishness, going from first layer to the ninth layer wouldn’t take much time. There was a 99% chance for her to reach humanity’s peak at nineteen years old.

In the world... there was actually a second person as freakish as Hu Niu?

“Who will fight me?” Zuo Qifang taunted. “Don’t make me wait too long.”

The Justice Mountain King was annoyed by his arrogance, so he jumped out immediately, and said, “This King will!”

“Alright, I’ll give you pointers,” Zuo Qifang said loftily.

The Justice Mountain King laughed out of extreme anger, and said, “Then let’s fight in the skies!”

“No need, one move is enough to subdue you. There’s no need to waste time!” Zuo Qifang said with a smile. These words were obviously even more arrogant.

The Justice Mountain King was instantly furious. His entire body was bound by lightning, while his hands formed seals as golden light shot in all directions.

The Thunderclap Ninth Heaven and the Earth Overturning Seal!

Ling Han nodded inwardly. The eight kings obviously knew each others’ Mystical Powers, and each person grasped not only a single one.

Zuo Qifang revealed a curious look, and said, “Mystical Powers? Hehe, I’m rather interested to see them.” He actually still had his hands behind his back; such arrogance was beyond overblown.

The Justice Mountain King let out a furious battle cry, and his figure charged out. With a zi , he turned into lightning, moving extremely quickly.

After turning into lightning, his speed was already shocking, and on top of the Shattering Void Tier standing on top of humanity’s peak, the speed was even more terrifying. Justice Mountain King’s body left an afterimage in its original place, but his real body already charged in front of Zuo Qifang, launching a hand seal right at Zuo Qifang’s chest as an array of golden light was shot out in all directions.

Peng!

As Earth Overturning Seal pressed down, Zuo Qifang was instantly smashed into pieces.

For a Shattering Void Tier elite, splitting into pieces was simply splitting into pieces, having no relation to death at all. He could completely reform his body, but he would definitely suffer heavy injuries.

Then, this battle would obviously be his defeat, which would mean that the wager would be lost.

“Hehe, a little interesting, but still not fast enough!” Zuo Qifang’s voice sounded, his body perfectly whole—the shattered body was also an afterimage!DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
