Chapter 1599: Conveniently shifting the blame

Han Qi felt immense regret.

He had drawn out the battle flag to turn the dispiriting situation around with it, but he had never imagined that Ling Han was even stronger than he was. The treasured swords he possessed were even stronger, making his disadvantage become more and more obvious.

“Damn it!” he roared in a low voice, and suddenly turned around to flee.

He was no match, so what was the point of battling to the death?

However, the space here overlapped greatly. When he ran over, he had spent countless time, and it was the same if he wanted to leave. He would have to spend a great amount of time to calculate and deduce the path to leave, but where would he get such time in the present situation?

Ling Han did not personally pursue him, but he slashed out with his sword, which tore a rip into space and reached right in front of Han Qi.

This scared Han Qi half to death. What was going on here?

Ling Han was also surprised, but then he recalled that both the Divine Demon Sword and Nine Heavens Flame were objects that would be Celestial King-level in future, and they naturally had their own unusual spots. It was normal that the Void Flower was unable to imprison their might.

After all, the Void Flower only contained the Regulations of Space, which would tempt a Celestial King. It did not mean that it itself was capable of opposing a Celestial King.

Pu!

The attack reached him, and Han Qi was forced to use the battle flag to parry the blow. The consequence was that the fiery blade struck the flag, and left behind a charred mark.

Han Qi almost died of heartache. In the Celestial Realm, Level 20 Godly Material was the highest grade, and above that, there was only Celestial Material. However, Celestial Material was difficult to obtain. Even the grand elders of the Han Qi could not possibly have such material, what more he. Even a great many Celestial Kings were unable to possess Celestial Material.

Then what were they to do?

The Celestial Realm had its own ways, and that was to use Level 20 Godly material as a base, and continuously meld it together to increase the grade of the Godly Material. In the Celestial Realm, the Godly Material produced from this kind of melding was termed Pseudo-Celestial Material, and there were a total of five grades, which were respectively from one to five stars. One star was the poorest grade, while five stars was the highest grade.

This flag of his actually didn’t even reach one star. At most, it could only be considered half a star. Yet, he had endlessly used his own power to create it through refining, and an elder of his clan had painted a fierce beast on the flag so that it could use celestial techniques.

In future, he would infuse more Godly Material so that this flag would become stronger as he became stronger, but he had not been in the Ancient Realm for that long, and this Nine Underworlds Frost Water Flag was already damaged, which struck him with heartache.

Ling Han laughed loudly. Han Qi was really considered to have driven himself into a dead corner. Now that he was trapped in overlapping space, there was no possibility for him to fight back. He would only be able to sustain being attacked.

“You asked for this!”

Ling Han endlessly struck out with his sword. Xiu, xiu, xiu. One after another, Sword Qi tore into space, and madly barraged at Han Qi. He had to take advantage of this time to deal with Han Qi. Otherwise, after one day, the effects of the power boost from the Black Tower would vanish, and by then, it would be he that would have to hide into the Black Tower.

Han Qi roared in fury. He brandished the battle flag to parry the attacks, but after each time he managed to successfully parry a blow, the flag would be torn and charred a bit, and as the damage accumulated, this flag had become battered.

“You have gone too far!” he called out loudly. “Our Han Clan is the overlord of the Nine Underworlds City. That is a large three-star city, and definitely not something that your Ding Clan can trifle with!”

“Come bite me!” Ling Han objected. The reason he had revealed the name of the Ding Clan was to create some trouble for the Ding Clan. Since he had promised Hu Yu to deal with the Ding Clan, he naturally did not mind creating some trouble for the Ding Clan before he himself even went to the Celestial Realm.

“Y-you will regret this!” Han Qi squeezed out through gritted teeth. Even a ruffian from a mere small one-star city dared to trifle with him. When he brought this news back to the Han Clan, the other would definitely cry.

“That is a matter of the future, and now I will kill you first!” Ling Han declared coldly. This guy actually dared make a move on his wife. This was something unforgivable.

Sword light blazed, and danced throughout the skies.

Han Qi really couldn’t hold on any longer. When the battle flag was completely reduced to just the flagpole, he, too, had fallen into desperate straits. He was repeatedly struck by the Sword Qi, and no matter how much he channelled the Nine Underworlds Frost to resist, it was useless.

The combined destructive power of the Divine Demon Sword and the Nine Heavens Flame was too frightening. It corroded his physical body, and harshly destroyed his vitality.

Pa!

Han Qi’s physical body was destroyed, and his spirit flew out, becoming a ball of light that was only about the size of a fist. That was a human figure that looked exactly like Han Qi. Sword Qi and the flames were still spreading out, but a serene light appeared, and forcibly blocked both the Sword Qi and the flames.

This serene light was incredibly strong, and forcibly tore a rip into space. It wrapped around Han Qi’s spirit, and with a flash, it had disappeared completely.

The space closed up again, as if Han Qi had never existed at all.

Ling Han’s heart shook. This definitely was not Han Qi’s own power. It was too strong, and had exceeded the level of the Genesis Tier.

“It is the protective measure that the grand elders of the Han Clan have placed on him. Once his physical body is destroyed, and his spirit is endangered, this energy would appear and bring his spirit back to the Celestial Realm.”

“...That will do as well. At present, the Han Clan only knows that I am a member of the Ding Clan, so they naturally will just go and make trouble for the Ding Clan.

“It is not advisable to stay here any longer. I will leave as soon as I pluck the Void Flower.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han immediately turned around and returned to the side of the Void Flower. He stretched out his hand to pluck it.

However, the space by the side of the Void Flower was collapsing. This had terrifying destructive power that could break and shatter everything that was trapped within. Thankfully, this was the Netherworld. The strongest power would only be the peak stage of the Genesis Tier, and Ling Han just happened to be standing presently on this cultivation level.

Patterns of great dao entwined around his hand, resisting the power of the collapsing space. Then, he grabbed the Void Flower, and xiu, stored it in the Black Tower.

Once the Void Flower had been plucked, the space in the surrounding area immediately returned to normal. There was no longer any collapse or overlapping of space.

Ling Han smiled slightly. With a thought, a golden path spread out. Since he presently had the power of the Genesis Tier, he naturally had to make good use of it.

All the Demon Masters watched as Ling Han disappeared, and then breathed a sigh of relief.

They were naturally worried as well, fearing that Ling Han would move to kill them to prevent them from leaking his secrets. Only once they could no longer sense any sign of Ling Han were they finally relieved, and hurriedly spread out their own golden paths and departed.

***

On the other side, Han Qi was wrapped by that serene light, broke through the barrier to the Celestial Realm, and entered into a completely new heaven and earth. Xiu, the serene light brought his spirit over numerous hills and streams. After several days, it arrived in the middle of a city.

This city was astonishingly huge, and could match any great star of the Immortal Realm.

“Humph!”

An incredibly powerful being released a sound of displeasure. He stretched out his hand and pressed down, and Han Qi’s spirit appeared in front of him. “What is going on? It has only been a few days, and you actually had your body destroyed, and was forced to use the boost in your body?”

“In reply to Eighth Elder, I was wounded by someone who is similarly from a Celestial Realm clan. I suspect... that person has obtained the inheritance of a Celestial King!” Han Qi explained.

“What!?” That powerful eighth elder stood up abruptly, and as his aura spread out, it was as if the heavens themselves were creeping in front of him. He was indescribably strong. “What clan is he descended from?”

“Dark Moon City, Ding Clan,” Han Qi hurriedly replied.

“Dark Moon City?” The eighth elder paused slightly, and then couldn’t help but look furious. “You didn’t even manage to defeat a descendant of a mere small one-star city?”

Han Qi’s expression was filled with grievance. “In reply to the eighth elder, that boy has obtained the inheritance of a Celestial King, and that was why I, why I was no match!”

Eighth Elder waved his sleeve, and said, “I will personally visit the Dark Moon City, and have them hand over the detailed information about that boy. Strange, mere Severing Mundane Tier actually has the ability to send another into the Ancient Realm?”

He frowned. This was a little unimaginable.
