Thank you readers!

Pu, pu!

However, before the two Fifth Tiers could finish speaking, one of the Sixth Tiers had already moved. With a single strike, the two of them were vomiting blood, severely wounded.

And this was still because they were at the Fifth Tier. If they were at the Fourth Tier, they would definitely be killed with a single strike.

Ling Han, Bai Mifan, and Feng Wuding were all shocked. What did these three people mean by their actions?

!!

“Seniors!” The two Fifth Tiers coughed up blood, their eyes filled with confusion. Why had they suddenly suffered such an attack?

Ling Han’s heart shuddered, and realization suddenly dawned on him.

He said to Bai Mifan, “Leave first!”

Bai Mifan looked towards him, his expression filled with confusion. He was the descendant of a Seventh Tier. Although the three people on the other side were Sixth Tiers, did they dare to make a move on him? It should be known that he had the means left behind by a Seventh Tier. Once he died, Bai Fan would immediately know everything.

The higher the cultivation level, the clearer one would be about how terrifying a Seventh Tier was. Even these three people wouldn’t dare to do such a thing.

“Idiot, they are Hysteria’s subordinates!” Ling Han shouted.

He finally discovered what was off about these three people. That was because they were the creations of Hysteria, so there was an incredibly strange component in their auras.

‘What?!’

Only now did Bai Mifan get a great shock. If these three people were Hysteria’s creations, then he wouldn’t have to worry about them not attacking him at all. In any case, they were already mortal enemies. To say nothing of killing a descendant of a Seventh Tier, even if they killed the descendants of all the Seventh Tiers, so what?

“What about you?” he asked Ling Han.

“I will fight them,” Ling Han was filled with fighting spirit.

“All right.” Bai Mifan made the decision, turned, and ran.

He ran, but the three Sixth Tiers did not give chase. They merely stared at Ling Han and Feng Wuding, and their aura gradually changed. What was originally only a bit of a cold aura completely spread out now, exuding endless evil.

At the same time, their forms also changed. One sprouted a few more arms, another grew out more legs, and the last had seven heads. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hysteria’s creations had many unique traits.

The difference was that their eyes were exuding the luster of intelligence.

This was understandable. If they hadn’t possessed such intelligence, they wouldn’t have been able to find this place at all. They would have long since been lost in the Void.

After such a long time, Hysteria finally made its move.

Ling Han was filled with lofty aspirations. He had just advanced to the Fourth Tier, and wanted to test out his own battle prowess.

With a shake of Ling Han’s right hand, Feng Wuding was knocked unconscious so that this guy would not cause trouble for him in battle. Ling Han smiled faintly. “Are you here to kill me or him?”

Feng Wuding was the person who had been chosen by the Genesis World of the last era. Perhaps Hysteria would also feel wary. Who knew what secrets this guy was hiding in his body? It was possible that they would only be unleashed when he reached the Fifth Tier, Sixth Tier, or even the Seventh Tier, eventually posing a threat to Hysteria.

“You both, have to, die!” a Sixth Tier monster spoke up, its voice dry, as if it had just learned to speak.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before shaking his head, and saying, “Normally, I wouldn’t care at all whether this person lives or dies. However, if Hysteria wants to kill him, I want to save him.” He shrunk Feng Wuding’s body with his powerful abilities, transforming it into a tiny dot that he casually stored away.

“Come on then!” Ling Han crooked a finger at the three Sixth Tier monsters.

The three monsters immediately charged over. Boom! Frightening battle prowess surged, rumbling out towards Ling Han.

They were very strong, all of them peak-stage Sixth Tiers. He was sure that Hysteria had to have paid a great price to create these three monsters.

This attack was at peak-stage Sixth Tier, so it was obvious that they wanted to succeed with the first strike.

Ling Han shook his head. If he had encountered these three monsters when he had still been at the Third Tier, he would definitely have been outmatched. He could only have immediately torn a rip into the Void and returned afterwards. Otherwise, staying for an extra instant could’ve possibly spelled death for him.

As for now? He was confident that he could put up a fight.

Boom! He channeled all the eighth-grade seals, and his battle prowess instantly soared madly.

He let out a battle cry, and brandished Fists of Fury to meet the incoming attack.

Peng!

Ling Han exchanged a blow with the three monsters, and his body suddenly shook. He felt blood rush upwards in his body, which made him feel very terrible.

In a battle of one against three, Ling Han still enjoyed the upper hand.

This was natural because these three monsters had not channeled Heavenly Venerable Seals, and Ling Han had directly closed the gap of 1000 times between the power of both sides. He would not lose even if it was one against three.

However, the three monsters immediately made a comeback. A Heavenly Venerable Seal lit up on each of them, instantly increasing their battle prowess by more than 70 times.

Second-grade seals!

Thankfully, every monster only channeled a second-grade seal. If they were also using combination seals, then Ling Han would really be having a headache. He would not be qualified to resist at all.

Boom!

They exchanged blows again. This time, it was Ling Han’s turn to be outmatched. The three great Sixth Tiers had boosted themselves with second-grade seals, and their battle prowess had increased explosively by more than 70 times. They had once again gained the upper hand in terms of power, and it was a crushing advantage at that.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and the 19 dimensional projections were unleashed together, suppressing the three Sixth Tiers.

However, it was utterly useless.

The Sixth Tier was too strong, and the dimensions inside Ling Han’s body hadn’t caught up to his cultivation level yet. They were only medium-level dimensions, so how could they suppress a Sixth Tier?

Peng! Merely being shaken by the aura of Sixth Tier, these dimensional projections were all turned into pieces.

Ling Han sighed internally. If he had let out a real dimension, it could still just barely withstand a few blows. However, if it was a dimensional projection, the gap would be too great, and would have no effect at all.

As he fought, he continued to retreat. This was a battle of one against three, and they were all peak-stage Sixth Tiers at that. It would be strange if he really won.

The three Sixth Tiers pursued him closely. They only had one thought in mind, and that was to kill.

No matter where Ling Han fled, they would persist and not give up. No matter who stood in their way, they would kill them without mercy.

Ling Han was very calm. At present, he also had Sixth-Tier battle prowess. If he wanted to kill someone at the same cultivation level as him, it would be as difficult as ascending the heavens.

He had no intention to fight to the death without retreating.

...

However, a peak-stage Sixth Tier was indeed powerful. No matter how Ling Han switched directions, they would always be able to firmly cling onto him. No matter what he tried, Ling Han would not be able to shake them off.

Time flew by as one side fled and the other side pursued. Before long, 300 years had already passed.

Ling Han continued to use the energy storms here to delay them, and even caused these three Sixth Tiers to suffer a little. However, they ignored it completely, and continued to pursue him closely.

“Dregs of Hysteria, take this!” A loud battle cry rang out, and two figures charged over at the same time.

Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang!

It was clear that the two greatest prodigies of all eternity had obtained great fortune here. Their cultivation level had already reached the peak stage of the Fifth Tier.

However, this was the real difficulty. Just think, they had all been stuck at the Fourth Tier for an epoch before finally advancing to the Fifth Tier. It could be imagined that without a crimson Great Herb, they might have to take two, three, or even more epochs to advance to the Sixth Tier.

However, with the cultivation level of peak-stage Fifth Tier, added with their freakishness, the strength of their battle prowess was definitely terrifying.

They charged over from the sidelines, and just happened to intercept those three Sixth-Tier monsters.

The two sides immediately came to blows, and the battle was incredibly intense.
