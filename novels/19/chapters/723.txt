Chapter 724: A Shocking Glory

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

At this moment, the anguish in Jia Ming’s heart must have magnified to an immeasurable extent.

They had all similarly made it into the list, and collectively forced the Lunar King down from it, so why was there such disparity in treatment? He was beaten up, yet Ling Han and Hu Niu were actually praised with a ‘well done’?

Well done your sister, it’s so unfair!

Yet Ling Han was dumbfounded as he remarked, “This ‘first’ was actually that Fatty Ma?”

The Lunar King nodded, then added, “Yes, it’s precisely that fatty! But, His Majesty was not a fatty before; on the contrary, he was an attractive and charming handsome man. If he had deigned to humbly court me, perhaps my heart would also be stirred.”

Every fatty had good potential!

Ling Han could not imagine how that Fatty Ma, whose horizontal width was comparable to his vertical height, had looked like when he was as lean as a lightning bolt. He also did not dare to imagine it, as Fatty Ma’s looks were already ingrained into his mind—no matter what, he could not relate him to being slim.

“You lot sure are impressive, to have actually forced His Majesty down the rankings. Just so you know, that fatty’s combat strength is truly fearsome—even if we, the eight Kings, fight against him together, we would not be his match.” A light glinted in the Lunar King’s beautiful eyes. “No wonder His Majesty has such high regard for you lot that even I also feel envious.”

That Fatty Ma was actually the holder of the first place since the beginning of history!

From the current perspective, it was not wrong to say that. That was because he had indeed already attained perfection of the Shattering Void Tier, and it was certain that he had also mastered the secret techniques he knew to the highest degree, far beyond what Ling Han and Hu Niu could compare with.

After all, he had spent so many years on cultivating extensively. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ling Han forced himself to stop pondering the fact that Fatty Ma also used to be lean. His heart was filled with great astonishment—the number one since ancient times, what kind of notion was this? Wrong, wrong, if Fatty Ma was so strong, then why had he sealed himself in the first place? Given his strength, he could already have split open the skies at that time.

It was not like one’s strength would advance with this seal—even if sealed for a million years, one’s cultivation would still be how it was a million years ago. And one would even age somewhat due to the change of time’s flow.

It was incomprehensible!

Ling Han lowered his voice and said, “Lord, what connection do you all actually have with this ancient kingdom?”

“Eh, didn’t you know that this ancient kingdom was called Purple Moon Kingdom?” the Lunar King responded laughingly.

Ling Han paused, and blurted out, “You’ve all established this ancient kingdom?”

“Of course. At that time, His Majesty led us, the Eight Great Kings, to unify the whole realm. The so-called five great sects were all beaten into a pulp, and we even snatched clean all their amassed resources, leaving them with no means left to seal any elites, breaking off their inheritance with no way to pass it on!” The Lunar King guffawed while reminiscing as she continued. “But someone from their upper ranks actually managed to hold out. Then, when we awoke, that previously defeated foe appeared so energetically again, how preposterous!”

Without inhibition, she did not lower her voice and was clearly heard by the people in the near vicinity immediately. And there was no one that wasn’t flustered with shock at hearing it.

So it turned out that this empire was so powerful that it once unified and ruled the whole realm, even the five great sects suffered a crushing defeat, and they were making a comeback now. No wonder their strength was horrifying—in just a few short months, they had already taken possession of nearly half of the lands in the middle state.

The Lunar King pondered, then pointed out something. “But during that time when we ruled over the realm, it had only been three thousand years since the last Reckoning, so there were not that many elites of the five great sects that had been sealed. Now, it’s a different matter. It has been almost ten thousand years, so their elites would have increased at least twofold. Moreover, we still have four Kings who have yet to awaken, and that is why we are unable to destroy them all in one go.”

This was already alarming enough, only four kings had awakened, yet they were already so ferocious. If all the eight Kings appeared together, it was indeed possible that they would once again conquer the whole realm; furthermore, Ma Duo Bao himself had yet to make a move, and he was a real elite whose battle prowess had emerged superior over multiple generations.

Ling Han mulled over it, and asked, “Why did you all seal yourselves for so long?”

“The time was not right.” The Lunar King shook her head. “The natural environment was too poor at the time. Martial arts had yet to achieve the peak, and power of the nation had also not reached the highest degree, as such...” She made a gesture that signified splitting open the skies. “Although His Majesty’s battle prowess has been the strongest in history, but he still could not compete, so we had no choice but to seal ourselves, awaiting an appropriate time to arise.”

Now was indeed a good time—the martial arts environment was heating up again, and the overall ability level of the realm had reached the strongest level in these ten thousand years, and so, naturally, the stronger would be the power of nation that they could borrow.

They would still have to possess strength. If they could not beat them with one shot, then they’d fight again after a nap.

“Given what you said, this place is yours?” Ling Han asked.

“Of course, why else did you think I chased after that damn Alchemy Pavilion?” The Lunar King humphed.

“That thing which has sprouted legs is an Alchemy Pavilion?” The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched momentarily; after all, it was his first time witnessing a building that sprouted legs and flew. It had practically gained a life of its own.

“That Alchemy Pavilion was forged from a divine metal; in fact, it is actually equivalent to an alchemy furnace. Furthermore, it has been nurtured endlessly by the precious Qi of the Earth that His Majesty has gathered—the longer the period of time, the stronger the effect,” the Lunar King continued. “But it was also because we overslept that that divine metal has been nurtured for too long by the precious Qi of the Earth, which allowed it to gain sentience, and it couldn’t even recognize myself or the Flame King!”

Ling Han probed, “Then you all still did not succeed?”

“No!” The Lunar King was furious. “The divine metal has practically gained a life of its own. Taking account of the time, it has been about two millenia at the very least. Being nourished by the precious Qi of the Earth day and night, this damned Alchemy Pavilion also became considerably impressive. From the looks of it, if His Majesty did not make a move personally, there would likely be no one in this world that could deal with it.”

Wasn’t that putting Ma Duo Bao on too high a pedestal?

But upon further thought, he was the number one in battle prowess since ancient times, so there would never be too many compliments and praise that he deserved.

Ling Han couldn’t help being curious, and asked, “What kind of alchemy art was that?” He was the Alchemy Emperor, and naturally was very much interested in anything related to alchemy.

“Tai Ji Star****,” the Lunar King answered.

There was an immediate change in Ling Han’s countenance as he said, “That is a divine pill!” High-level Heaven Grade pills were considered divine pills. There were even some Shattering Void Tier cultivators who were still unable to consume them, as their bodies would explode from the sheer strength of the pill. The Tai Ji Star**** was one of the highest quality alchemical pills among them all; it was capable of increasing the strength of one’s divine sense.

But exactly how strong, that Ling Han wouldn’t know, because he was not at all familiar with the hierarchy of the Immortal Grade’s levels.

“That’s right, it was part of our plans to consume it after successful concoction... but, unexpectedly, that damn Alchemy Pavilion actually dared to ignore me!” The Lunar King was practically about to die from fury.

Ling Han smilingly said, “No need to rush, there’s still a long time to go.”

Even if the five great sects were suppressed, opening up the skies was easier said than done. All the people had to submit willingly. If not, power of the nation would merely be akin to poison.

“Oh, right. Since you’ve managed to enter the Tool Pavilion, what kind of precious tool did you get?” the Lunar King casually asked.

Ling Han took out the Revere Life Sword, and answered, “This tool here.”

The Lunar King inhaled sharply as she responded, “The number one killing sword has actually fallen into your hands? And yet, the fatty actually claimed that there was no one in this world apart from him who could obtain that sword.

“You’re so lucky, kid. This precious tool was forged by his majesty’s own hands. Also, it is the only one, its mighty ability... is unimaginable!”
