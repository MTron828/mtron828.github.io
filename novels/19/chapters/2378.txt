Chapter 2379: Returning to the family line

The broken mountain had been reasonably made use of, with multiple palace halls built on it, making it seem very luxurious and magnificent.

Ling Han shook his head internally. This broken mountain should be the source of humiliation for the Nine Snake Tribe, and should be eternally carved into their memories, yet now there was a false facade of peace. Just what were these descendants thinking?

It was like Luan Sang, Luan Tianjun, and the others did not remember at all how their Celestial King ancestor had been killed, so they did not feel the slightest sense of shame, and only felt great pride due to being the descendant of a Celestial King.

There were really a considerable number of people here. When they saw how many there were in Ling Han’s group, they all ran out to watch them as they proceeded.

The attractiveness of this tribe was really very high. The men were all handsome and the women were beautiful, which was a pleasing sight to the eye.

When someone asked about who Ling Han and his group were, Luan Sang offered a simple explanation. When they knew that such a supremely exquisite woman like the Empress was actually a member of their clan, the people around all looked proud, as if their only concern was external appearance, and all other matters like strength and cultivation level could be set aside for the moment.

“Please wait a while,” Luan Sang said as he turned to them after he led them to stand in front of a palace hall. Next, he walked into the palace hall.

A while later, he walked out, wearing a reserved smile. “Ancestor has summoned you.”

This declining tribe really had great airs. For the sake of the Empress, Ling Han did not show any temper, and merely responded with a slight smile. The Empress, on the other hand, showed a hint of displeasure, her expression slightly icy.

They entered the palace hall. The inside was furnished very magnificently, with the furs of various Immortal Beasts covering the floor, while precious gems were embedded in the stone pillars, illuminating the entire great hall.

They walked all the way to the other end of the great hall. There were various young people seated on either side, and they were all in deep focus, while chanting was presently reciting teachings, calming the heart and spirit, and resonating with Heavenly Dao.

“Ancestor is teaching,” Luan Sang said with slight reservedness, but the pride in his expression could not be concealed. “Ancestor is at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier. Furthermore, he is just a single step away from the Celestial King Tier. When the Celestial Path opens, Ancestor will definitely manage to become a Celestial King!”

A Celestial King with a lofty, noble status, which no one else could compare to.

Ling Han really could not bear to see the sense of superiority these people had. He hadn’t become a Celestial King yet, right? So why were they so smug?

“Come.” Luan Sang led the way ahead, bringing them into the depths of the great hall. A man was seated in a lofty position there. He was an elder with a tall, lanky frame, dressed in white robes and exuding a sagely air.

Seal after seal was spat from his mouth, turning into lotus flowers which fluttered around the surroundings, and sank into the foreheads of the young people in the great hall respectively. He was teaching by example.

“Greetings, Ancestor!” When Luan Sang had come close enough, he bowed down respectfully, a heated look in his eyes. This was the strongest elite of the Nine Snake Tribe, as well as their pillar, an existence that would definitely become a Celestial King in the future.

The white-robed elder’s eyes opened, and his eyes passed over Ling Han and his group. When he spotted the Empress, his eyes shone brilliantly, and then he nodded. “Very good, very good. Another descendant with a pure bloodline has emerged from our bloodline. This is a sign that we are blessed by the heavens!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even as he spoke, the lotus flowers of great dao that were coming from his mouth did not end. Multi-tasking was naturally no big deal for an Ascending Origin Tier elite.

Luan Sang turned his head, and couldn’t help but frown. He shouted, “You actually do not kneel when meeting Ancestor?”

However, the white-robed elder laughed, and waved a hand dismissively. “She has not returned to the line and acknowledged her ancestors yet. There’s no need to rush things.” As for the others? They were all outsiders. Even if they wanted to bow to him, they were not worthy.

“Child, what is your name?” he asked again, very concerned about the Empress.

The Empress scoffed. ‘Just who do you think you are? I have to answer any question you ask?’

“Luan Xing.” Yet Ling Han smiled, and answered on her behalf. He wanted to see just how arrogant this tribe had become, and exactly why would they have such an astonishing superiority complex.

“What is your cultivation level?” the white-robed elder asked, slightly hesitant.

With his insight as a consummate level Ascending Origin Tier, he should be able to tell the Empress’s cultivation level with a single look. Otherwise, it would mean that the latter’s cultivation level was at the same level as his. He naturally could not believe this. The Empress’s flame of life had only been burning for several million years, not even comparing to the scraps of his age.

“Immortal Palace Tier,” Ling Han answered simply.

The white-robed elder’s eyes involuntarily lit up. Possessing the purest bloodline of the Nine Snake Tribe, and attaining Immortal Palace Tier when she was only several million years old? This kind of aptitude was truly amazing.

He laughed loudly. “Good, good, good. Good child!”

The elder began to talk, mainly about how he was going to gather the Nine Snake Tribe again, raising himself to a very high position, which Ling Han mocked endlessly in his heart. From the look of things, the Empress’s prideful character was really not unique, but rather a common ailment of this entire tribe.

After talking for a long time, he finally commanded Luan Sang to bring the Empress and the others to rest as he would hold a ceremony for the Empress to acknowledge her ancestors after selecting an auspicious day.

Though the Empress was disdainful, she did not say anything.

…In the first place, she was a descendant of the Nine Snake Tribe, so what need was there for her to return to the line and acknowledge her ancestors? Could it be that she would not be a member of the Nine Snake Tribe without this ceremony?

Moreover, she did not have any sense of association with these clansmen. Why was it she was the one required to acknowledge her ancestors? In the eyes of someone as proud as she was, it should be these people that should be acknowledging her instead.

Ling Han merely wrapped an arm around her waist, subtly indicating the Empress to keep calm and not to be impatient. After all, these people were her family. He wanted the Empress to have her own family—though relatives like them could only be considered the most distant of relatives.

With Luan Sang’s arrangements, they were led into a palace hall, and settled down there.

A clanswoman who had nine doppelgangers had returned, and one that had even reached the height of Immortal Palace Tier at that. For the Nine Snake Tribe, this was a serious matter. After all, they were no longer the Celestial King Tier force they had once been. Even the strongest among them was only at the Ascending Origin Tier, and there was only a single one at that.

Hence, this ceremony would be greatly and elaborately conducted.

Meanwhile, the Empress brought Ling Han and the others around. She was looking for the lost inheritance of this tribe so that she could complete her bloodline.

Previously, she had absorbed the Divine Fetus of Gu Daoyi, and had also obtained a portion of his memories, so she knew where he had obtained this inheritance from. Thus, she soon found an underground palace, but it was guarded, and others were forbidden from entering.

At first, the Empress was going to flip out, but Ling Han persuaded her otherwise. After acknowledging her ancestors, the Empress naturally could enter this place, and there was no need to become hostile now.

Of course, Ling Han was not afraid of the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe. He only thought that these were the only family members left to the Empress.

The Empress considered for a moment, and let the matter go. She only went on a scenic tour with Ling Han and the others while cultivating the Regulations of the Celestial Realm. Once it was time, she would be able to break through naturally, and return to the Ascending Origin Tier.

Because the ceremony was going to be elaborately held, the Nine Snake Tribe had also invited a great many guests. The island had become more and more lively throughout the last few days.

The Empress was exquisite beyond compare, which naturally attracted the eyes of countless. There were some young prodigies within the clan, as well as guests from outside the clan among them. However, this was the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe, after all, and the Empress was a rising star of the clan, so no one made any inappropriate actions.

Another 10 days later, the ceremony for acknowledging ancestors was held officially.

Everything was going smoothly, but just as the ceremony was drawing to a close, a young man suddenly leaped out, and demanded with great displeasure, “Lord Gui, didn’t you say that the person you betrothed to me is the most beautiful in your clan?”

He paused, and pointed at the Empress. “Have you all gone blind? I want this one!”
