Chapter 1413 Killing Without Amnesty

Ling Han didn’t plan to ask any more questions. However, perhaps Ding Li’an even knew about the secret of the Nine Kings, and that they were the clones of Empress Luan Xing. Otherwise, how would he dare to take this gamble by himself? If just one of the Nine Kings was still awake, they would be able to respond and unleash power at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. An elite at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier would be insta-killed by such overwhelming power.

It was best that the secret of the Nine Snake Tribe remained a secret forever.

“Ling Han, it was a grave error not to kill you at that time!” Ding Li’an raised his right hand, which immediately turned as white as jade. In fact, even his skin became transparent, revealing the bones and pulsing veins inside his hand.

“White Jade Murderous Heaven Palm!” the Right Minister exclaimed in a trembling voice.

Gasp!

The color drained from Qu Qiuxue and the other’s faces.

This was a tremendously powerful secret technique, yet it wasn’t much of a secret. Anyone who reached the Heavenly Body Tier could learn this secret technique from the treasure storage of the Imperial Family. However, in all these years, no one had ever mastered this secret technique before.

It was far too difficult!

However, Ding Li’an shocked everyone once again.

He was definitely a supreme genius. After all, he had advanced from the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier to the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier in just 1,000,000 years. Thus, was it truly surprising that he could also master the White Jade Murderous Heaven Palm?

Murderous aura exploded into the surroundings as his palm lashed outward, desiring to annihilate all matter.

To say nothing of elites at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, even those at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier would be killed by the murderous aura if they didn’t defend against it with their full power.

The killing intent in Ling Han’s eyes became more and more intense. ‘Holy motherf*cker, this bastard actually dared to target my wife? He’s seeking death!’

It was an individual’s freedom to fantasize about such things in their mind. He couldn’t control one’s thoughts and imagination. However, Ding Li’an actually dared to transform his fantasies into action? Ling Han had no reason to show him any kindness or mercy.

‘Die!’

Ling Han charged forward, not attempting to dodge Ding Li’an’s attack.

“You’re seeking death!” Ding Li’an said coldly. He had already restrained himself for so many years, and he could finally rip off his disguise now. This sent a feeling of euphoria through him.

Ling Han retrieved his wooden sword. It seemed as if this sword would undergo peculiar transformations if it drank the blood of powerful elites. However, under normal circumstances, he obviously couldn’t use this sword to wantonly kill people. Ling Han activated Tide of the Ages as he slashed down with the wooden sword.

The murderous aura... instantly aged, losing all of its menacing might.

“What?!”

Ding Li’an was stunned by what he saw. That was the White Jade Murderous Heaven Palm! It was a secret technique that he had spent 300,000 years to master! He had been confident that he could kill anyone weaker than himself with this palm—in one strike, no less. He couldn’t fathom any other outcome.

Yet, he had actually failed to kill an elite at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier? No, no, no. Not only had he failed to kill him, but he had even failed to slow him down! His opponent’s wooden sword was already slashing toward him!

“Humph!”

A long staff materialized in the air—it was Ding Li’an’s favorite weapon. This staff had followed him for countless years, and they were already able to read each other’s minds. The staff instantly parried the wooden sword.

Ding!

The sword landed, and the staff was instantly snapped into two. The sword didn’t stop, and it continued to slash toward Ding Li’an.

Pu!

Ding Li’an immediately vomited a mouthful of blood. His staff was linked to his mind, and his staff being snapped was equivalent to him being struck by the sword. His aura wilted drastically.

However, the sword had already landed!

He wanted to retreat, yet the stone door was directly behind him. How could he retreat? Moreover, Ling Han was attacking him in rage, so how could he hope to evade his attack?

Pu!

Ding Li’an was instantly sliced into two. The wooden sword was bathed in blood, and the divine patterns upon it became even clearer. They slithered around the sword like snakes, exuding an extremely sinister aura as they did so.

This... was a treasure of the Netherworld!

Ling Han finally came to a realization. No wonder this sword was so sinister. Moreover, it even gave him a slight urge to go crazy and go on a wanton killing spree.

He humphed in his mind. Could he not defeat this mere sword?

Qu Qiuxue and the others were numb with shock. They had already been rendered completely speechless.

In the past, Ling Han had killed Zhao Jianbai with a single slash. However, they had both been at the low extreme at that time. Now, however? He had killed Ding Li’an—an elite at the high extreme—with a single slash as well! Just how powerful was Ling Han?

Ling Han walked to the stone door and also started to undo the restrictions.

However, it was also at this moment that he could see the loyalty of the others. The Left and Right Ministers as well as the generals remained silent, with only Qu Qiuxue questioning him, asking, “What are you doing?”

Ling Han humphed softly, and replied, “Opening the door, of course! I’m going to take my wife away. What else am I supposed to do? Leave her here to die?” However, even though he had some mastery in formations, the difficulty of the formations before him was far beyond his understanding.

He definitely couldn’t undo these restrictions any time soon.

If he had known this earlier, he would have held back for longer, only killing Ding Li’an after he had undone all of these restrictions.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Applause suddenly reverberated through the garden as a domineering figure descended from the sky. Behind this figure was at least 50 other elites, all of them hovering in the sky.

They were all Heavenly Body Tier elites!

The leading figure was none other than the Eternity Sky Emperor. He gazed down at them, and said, “You people aren’t going to kneel upon seeing me?”

Boom!

A devastating might instantly enveloped them, causing even the Left and Right Ministers and the others to tremble uncontrollably. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han turned around. The situation was different now, and his plan to open the stone door and take Empress Luan Xing away was clearly infeasible now. Not only was he not going to open the stone door, but he even had to guard it now, preventing anyone else from nearing it.

“King of Curses, haven’t you learned your lesson yet? Your arm has already been severed once. Perhaps you want your arm to be severed a second time?” Ling Han immediately launched a powerful verbal attack.

Weng!

A wave of disbelief rippled through the Heavenly Body Tier elites behind the Eternity Sky Emperor. Their emperor had actually lost an arm before? And judging by Ling Han’s tone, this was somehow related to him?

Gasp!

Just how powerful was this brat?

A dark expression spread across the Eternity Sky Emperor’s face. Only he and his brother knew that his arm had been severed while retrieving the Nine Demons Sword. How was a third person aware of this? He refused to believe that his brother, Chang Tao, would reveal this secret to others.

Moreover, Ling Han was far too toxic. He had actually called him the King of Curses!

However, it would be extremely difficult for him to explain himself. Was he supposed to say that his severed arm had nothing to do with Ling Han? And that it had actually been severed by the ancestral weapon of his clan? This would only smear his name more and more. In any case, was he here to debate this point?

“Who’s going to capture him for me?” he asked calmly. As the ruler of a Majestic Empire, he naturally couldn’t do everything personally.

“Heh, I’m not late to the party, am I?” Another domineering figure descended into the garden. This person was none other than the Jade Drop Emperor. Like the Eternity Sky Emperor, he also had a large group of Heavenly Body Tier elites behind him.

The faces of the Left and Right Ministers and the others were all ashen. Apart from surrendering, their only other option was to battle to the death. Was there a third option for them to take?

“This elder will capture him,” an old and hunch-backed elder said as he stepped forward. His body radiated with an air of death, and it was clear that he was already nearing the very end of his lifespan. However, the aura that radiated from him was still incredibly formidable.

Judging by the fact that this elder could refer to himself as “elder” before the Eternity Sky Emperor, he definitely wouldn’t be a pushover. He was an elite at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, and he had in fact shot to fame even before the Eternity Sky Emperor.

It was also because of this that he was nearing the end of his lifespan.

He stared at Ling Han, curiosity and greed in his eyes. There was more so a glimmer of eager anticipation.

This youth had shot to the Heavenly Body Tier in such a short amount of time, so there was definitely a great secret hidden on his body. If he could obtain this secret, perhaps he would be able to break through to the Eternal River Tier. If he succeeded, he would regain his vitality and also gain an exorbitant lifespan. Moreover, he would become the most powerful being in this world, someone who could rule over an entire galaxy.

These thoughts fuelled his greed. However, he was also slightly worried. What if Ling Han had simply ingested some Great Herb of heaven and earth?

“Young man, obediently surrender to me. This elder can grant you a swift death.” He reached over, his hand transforming into a gigantic jet-black palm as he did so.

How could Ling Han block this attack? His opponent was an elite at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier!
