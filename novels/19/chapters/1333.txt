Chapter 1334 Confrontation with Eternal River Tier

One younger and the other older, one stronger and the other weaker, and both were standing on opposite sides of each other.

The difference in strength was as large a disparity as the gulf between heaven and earth, but in terms of aura, Ling Han was not the slightest bit inferior.

How many people would dare look an Eternal River Tier in the eye like this? Putting aside the clash of eye contact like this, even a sliver of the aura from an Eternal River Tier would be able to crush a Sun Moon Tier into dust.

“It is unfortunate that you are not a member of our Xie Clan!” After a while, Xie Qian spoke up, and said such words in an incredibly regretful tone.

This was the first person he had seen that could endure the heavenly tribulation with such ease. Even he, an elite of Eternal River Tier, had to admit he was impressed, and was filled with strong admiration for Ling Han. However, it was too bad; who asked Ling Han to have killed his descendant?

Members of the Xie Clan... could not be humiliated!

Hence, he could only feel regret because a future king tier, or perhaps even a top-grade elite, would soon die in his hands.

This caused him to feel regretful and rueful at the waste of precious resources.

But it was only that. He had been alive for several hundred million years, so how could it be that the number of prodigies who died at his hand would be few? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

To an elite of Eternal River Tier, a half day’s time would be like a blink of an eye, and would very soon pass.

The heavenly tribulation dispersed as suddenly as it had appeared. It ended astonishingly quickly, without the slightest warning.

Kuang, after the last bolt of lightning had descended, the thunderclouds that filled the skies completely disappeared in a single instant.

Xie Qian made his move. As he stretched out his right hand, a galaxy appeared, where several hundred million stars were floating, and it pressed down on Ling Han. Every star was filled with the power of a Heavenly Body Tier elite, and with several hundred million attacking at the same time, it was equivalent to the power capable of destruction of a world.

And this was only a sliver of divine sense from Xie Qian.

Boom!

When this attack landed, a massive pit was blasted into the ground. It was as wide as 100 miles and a dozen over miles deep, showing how terrifying the power of an Eternal River Tier elite was. And this was still because this was the Two Realm Battlefield, which was located in a strange space. Otherwise, if he had used the same attack in the outside world, then there would definitely not have been the slightest hint of life left within 10,000 miles from the epicenter.

The crushed rocks and dust formed a huge mushroom cloud, which rose up into the skies.

A sliver of shock appeared on Xie Qian’s face. That was because in the instant before his attack landed on Ling Han, the latter had disappeared.

He curled his hand carelessly, and a gust of wind instantly rose up, sweeping aside all the dust and rubble that filled the area.

Where was he?

A pondering look appeared on Xie Qian’s face. He definitely had not sensed the shock wave that came from a rip in space, so Ling Han could not have fled with any kind of instant teleportation seal. Furthermore, it would also need time to activate instant teleportation. With that attack from him, even if Ling Han possessed an instant teleportation seal, he would not have been able to use it.

Moreover, this place caused the range of his attack to decrease greatly, but it was also the same for an instant teleportation seal. Even if Ling Han had truly teleported instantly, he would not have been able to escape out of the range of his attack. He would still have died.

However... Ling Han had disappeared as if he was air itself.

“Strange!” Xie Qian mumbled involuntarily. It had already been many years since he was last moved, yet today, because of a Sun Moon Tier youth, he had been moved two subsequent times.

“I am really now quite curious. What tricks has this boy actually gotten hold of?” He released his divine sense from his body, and it rapidly stretched out over this area, searching for Ling Han’s whereabouts.

Doing this instantly caused the other Heavenly Body Tier elites to feel shock. What did you mean by releasing your divine sense for no rhyme or reason?

Were you trying to pick a fight?

Eternal River Tiers were too powerful, and if they released their divine sense without any qualms, they could all extend it for 10,000 miles. They could release a powerful attack in this effective area, just like how he had attacked Ling Han previously.

If this was his own territory, that was fine. So what if he released his divine sense? Who would dare to care?

But this place was different. There were several dozen Eternal River Tier elites, and if anyone released their divine sense, it could possibly be treated like a provocation by the others.

Putting aside the fact that there were still Netherworld elites here, even if they all belonged to the same force, they might not be able to trust him to this extent and allow themselves to be enshrouded by the divine sense of another. What if he suddenly rose in revolt? Then it would be indefinite what kind of suffering would await them.

Before this, every Eternal River Tier elite had all pulled back their divine sense into a very, very small range to avoid provoking others and causing an unnecessary misunderstanding. But precisely because of this, no one would think that Xie Qian would have been so outrageously bold to actually want to oppose all the Eternal River Tiers here.

Putting aside the fact that Xie Qian’s battle prowess might not be the strongest here, even if it was, being ganged up by so many other elites, he would definitely be finished as well.

Thus, everyone was curious. What was this Xie Qian doing?

Xie Qian was not in the mood to care what the others were thinking. He did not think that he would be ganged up on. After all, they were all Eternal River Tier elites. If there was not deadly feud between them, they would not rashly start a fight. Of course, he could not go too far, either. Otherwise, once an alliance formed, then he could only flee pathetically. He would definitely lose and die if he went head-on against them.

But no matter how much he stretched out his divine sense in search, he did not find Ling Han’s whereabouts anywhere. This caused his expression to become increasingly odd, and also more serious.

There were already not many things that could cause him to look at with much importance, but this definitely could be considered as one of them.

“Xie Qian, have you done enough?” an Eternal River Tier elite asked coldly. Stretching out his divine sense without qualms like this, weren’t you deliberately provoking them?

Once was enough, but if you continued to do so, that was a little too far, wasn’t it? Did you really think that you were the king of Eternal River Tier?

Xie Qian frowned. He knew that the tolerance level of the other elites had reached their limit. Immediately, he slowly drew back his divine sense. This divine sense was like the sea waters that were at low tide and quickly retreated from all directions, and when his divine sense retreated to that ancient coffin, he suddenly started.

“Wu!” He released a muffled humph, his expression instantly twisting in an inhuman look. His divine sense went berserk like a tsunami, and began a barrage.

“Ah!” It was in that one instant that at least a few hundred people had their spirits directly shattered and became zombies, and there was an Eternal River Tier elite from the Netherworld in that area as well. He had also been attacked by Xie Qian’s divine sense, so he immediately flew into a thunderous rage. With a loud roar, he began to attack Xie Qian.

However, he had not yet shot out his palm when his expression turned ashen in shock. That was because Xie Qian’s present appearance was too appalling. Black blood was pouring out of all his apertures. If this happened to a mortal, he would definitely not be living too long after.

Immortals naturally would not die just from bleeding from their apertures, but a great Eternal River Tier elite would actually look so tragic; what exactly was wrong with him?

“Killing members of our Netherworld, do you not feel that you should provide an explanation?” this elite of the Netherworld asked coldly. Those who had died just now were all people of the Netherworld, and furthermore, they were all related to him. Otherwise, they would not have been qualified to stay by his side.

Yet Xie Qian only acted as if he had not heard anything. His hands were covering his ears, and increasing amounts of black blood surged out from his eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears. The blood seeped through his fingers, and four heavenly bodies appeared, but each heavenly body was actually exploding.

Every heavenly body that exploded would mean a slight decline in the power of an Eternal River Tier. Though there were several tens of thousands stars in the galaxy, it could not hold up to such depletion, either. Not too long after, they would all explode into nothing.

How different was this from committing suicide?

Crazy, he had really gone crazy!
