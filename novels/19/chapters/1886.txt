Chapter 1887: Sudden Turn

Ling Han pondered for a moment before replying, “Perhaps Senior wanted to find someone who isn’t afraid of power and might?”

“Young man, you’re worth teaching!” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a hearty laugh. He stroked his beard, and continued, “I purposefully allowed Little Mo to act so haughtily because I wanted to see if anyone dared to speak out. However, it’s a shame that no one ever dared to step forward to oppose him.”

Disappointment spread across his face, and he said, “In fact, this was a test for those Holy Sons and Holy Daughters. However, who would’ve thought that they would all try to please Little Mo instead? Heh, they lack even the most basic confidence and toughness, so how can they lead a powerful sect?”

If Lu Xianming and the others heard this, they would definitely feel extremely vexed and stifled.

Were they not pleasing Alchemy Apprentice Mo out of respect and reverence for Alchemist Zi Cheng? Now, however, they were being belittled as nothing but trash.

However, this made a lot of sense. As Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, they should have indeed possessed the toughness and domineering might of leaders. Regardless of how arrogant and wanton Alchemy Apprentice Mo was, he shouldn’t have been able to ride on top of the Holy Sons’ and Holy Daughters’ heads. Otherwise, what ethics and rules would there still be?

Ling Han didn’t comment on this. After all, these were the considerations of a high and mighty ruler. He didn’t have the right to comment on these matters.

“Heh, let’s not talk about this. At the very least, you’ve arrived here,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said, suddenly changing the topic. A look of appreciation spread across his face, and he asked, “Brat, are you interested in joining Alchemy City?”

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “Since Senior has asked, I naturally have no reason to refuse!”

“Brat, you were already planning on joining, weren’t you? Yet, you’ve come here to flatter me now!” Alchemist Zi Cheng chuckled, and continued, “However, I’m relatively pleased to hear your flattering words.”

“As long as you’re happy,” Ling Han said. At this moment, he was no longer haughty and arrogant.

He indeed wanted to learn some things from Alchemy City. In fact, he wanted to learn many things. This was a force that had existed for heaven knew how many billions of years. Perhaps it had already existed for several epochs. Thus, it was in possession of countless pill recipes. To Ling Han, these were extremely valuable resources that were no less than Celestial King Tier cultivation techniques.

One had to realize that Alchemy City had once produced a Five-Star Alchemist!

“You... can become the 10th Holy Son of the Alchemy City!” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a solemn expression. He paused for a moment before continuing, “However, the position of Holy Son is incredibly important, so I can’t decide this all by myself. I need you to convince everyone with your abilities.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Through fighting? This is up my alley, and I can guarantee that I’ll beat all of the other Holy Sons into submission.”

Alchemist Zi Cheng faltered upon hearing this. He was rendered slightly speechless.

Was his potential successor a born fighter? Upon encountering any disagreement, his first thought was to fight? How barbaric!

Alchemists enjoyed an extremely lofty status, so how could they fight and tussle all day long? Doing so would be far too lowly!

“Through alchemy, of course!” Alchemist Zi Cheng hurriedly corrected.

“Oh...” Ling Han appeared slightly disappointed upon hearing this. This was something that could be resolved with fists, so why couldn’t they be more direct and forthright?

Alchemist Zi Cheng felt slightly regretful now. How was this Holy Son so violent? In the future, would he pummel anyone he didn’t like? Wouldn’t that be losing face for Alchemy City?

His expression was solemn, and he said, “If you want to become the 10th Holy Son of the Alchemy City, you have to prove yourself through your strength in alchemy.”

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “I know how to refine pills.”

Alchemist Zi Cheng roared with laughter, and he said, “That can’t be considered as refining pills. At most, you’re only just barely refining pills.”

Ling Han wasn’t willing to accept this. The first time he had refined a Celestial pill, it had already been at the medium level. Thus, was his talent not freakish?

“Don’t be dissatisfied,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a chuckle. “Your alchemy talent is indeed outstanding. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have picked you to transform the decaying ways of Alchemy City. In terms of alchemy, however, you’re genuinely a novice. Any random person is 100 times more skilled than you.”

Ling Han was even more unwilling to accept this, and he was just about to open his mouth to speak. However, Alchemist Zi Cheng waved his hand, signifying for him to remain silent.

“Refining alchemical pills is similar to tempering weapons. This isn’t a process that’s completed in a single step. Instead, it requires many steps and refinements, and a great amount of work,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said in a leisurely voice.

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this. Refining pills required many steps and refinements? Was this a joke? When refining pills, one would either succeed or fail. Failure was just that—failure. How could there be any concept of refinement?

Alchemist Zi Cheng noticed his confusion, and he said, “Take out a Celestial pill that you’ve refined.”

Ling Han did as he was told, handing a Celestial pill to Alchemist Zi Cheng.

“Follow me,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said. He led Ling Han into the alchemy room. He then lit up a cauldron, and it was as if he were about to refine a pill.

Ling Han gasped upon seeing this. ‘You’re truly going to refine my pill again?’

Alchemist Zi Cheng didn’t explain anything. Instead, he directly tossed the Celestial pill into the cauldron before him. He then immediately started to strike the cauldron with his palms.

This was no joke, and the force of his strikes roused the Great Dao of Fire, triggering brilliant rays of Regulation light.

Under the heat of these profound flames, the Celestial pill quickly showed signs of melting. It was also at this moment that Alchemist Zi Cheng suddenly gave a soft shout, and unleashed bursts of light from his palms, sending them into the Celestial pill.

The Celestial pill instantly lit up with a brilliant glow, causing the surroundings to become as dazzling as could be.

A look of astonishment spread across Ling Han’s face. This was because the Celestial pill actually stopped melting! Instead, it started to undergo some other change.

He was unable to describe this change, and he could only ascertain that the Celestial pill was undergoing some kind of fundamental transformation. In terms of whether this transformation was positive or negative, he also had no idea.

Anyhow, this alchemy room possessed the ability to speed up time. One day outside would be equivalent to 100 days inside.

Thus, after almost one day in the outside world, 90 or so days had already passed inside the alchemy room.

Ling Han had observed Alchemist Zi Cheng’s techniques this entire time. Although he didn’t fully understand them, he was certain that a Four-Star Alchemist wouldn’t show him these techniques for no reason. They wouldn’t toy with him in such a way.

On the 93rd day, Alchemist Zi Cheng suddenly gave a soft shout before opening his mouth, and breathing out a column of purple light. Looking closely, this was an orb of purple flame that was pulsating with a terrifying radiance.

This was Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s Source Power!

Each cultivator possessed their own Source Power, and these were generally very lackluster. Ling Han was an exception, however, and he had obtained two Source Powers of heaven and earth. Otherwise, his Source Powers wouldn’t have been so extravagant.

Alchemist Zi Cheng’s Source Power flames enveloped the Celestial pill.

Theoretically speaking, these flames should have instantly incinerated the Celestial pill. However, Alchemist Zi Cheng had clearly controlled his power extremely well. The Celestial pill spun around inside the purple flames, and it started to become increasingly transparent, like a crystal.

“Exit!” Alchemist Zi Cheng exclaimed as he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The Celestial pill flew into his palm.

“Compare it to before,” he said as he casually tossed the Celestial pill to Ling Han.

Ling Han caught the pill and started to carefully examine it. He immediately exclaimed in surprise.

A new golden-veined pattern had appeared on the Celestial pill. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He observed it again, and he then raised it up to take a sniff. His expression immediately changed, and he exclaimed, “It’s reached the High Level!”

This was unfathomable! An alchemical pill should have remained at whatever level it was at upon the completion of its refinement. How could it be refined a second time, and even rise in level?

Just what kind of celestial technique was this?

Ling Han looked up at Alchemist Zi Cheng, and his eyes were filled with puzzlement and keen interest.
