Chapter 2370: At the end of the line? Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable appears!

“Die!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate brandished his sword, and a majestic light blazed. Only a strong Sword Qi was left in this world. It was like an emperor had come out, and everyone could only kneel on the ground and bow to him.

This was a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious Tool, Jiuwu Great Imperial Sword!

In front of this imperial sword, any other sword-like Tools could only tremble. This was the reverence they felt towards a Heavenly Venerate.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le clenched his fists, and greeted the incoming blow.?Peng, peng, peng, sword light and Fist Qi collided, dazzling hundreds of millions of kilometers.

They exchanged a series of several hundred blows before finally ending the clash for this round. Copious amounts of blood were gushing from Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s fists, looking just like a golden celestial fluid.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le frowned slightly. His present battle prowess had dropped so greatly that he would actually be wounded by the other’s weapon.

He would be more willing to battle intensely to boiling point, drawing the interference of the heaven and earth so that they both would not dare to continue the battle further. Otherwise, should the power of heaven and earth move aggressively, it was definitely not something that a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could deal with.

After all, neither of them had transcended, and they were still limited by this realm.

But he had not expected that his own battle prowess would actually decline so greatly. Going by the look of things now, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable only had to summon his own precious Tool, and the two of them combining forces should be capable of very quickly suppressing him.

“Wu Le, what is the point?” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable asked coldly. “Since you have already become the dust of history, why did you have to appear again?”

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed, his fighting spirit reignited. How could a Heavenly Venerate possibly feel despair? Even after being refined by the Desolate Eternity Heavenly Venerate for so many years, he had never given up, and had always been earnestly preserving that sliver of practically impossible hope.

However, he had truly managed to wait until Ling Han came.

He wiped his blood casually, and pressed the Heavenly Venerate blood on Ling Han’s body.

Instantly, Ling Han grunted, feeling like his skin was on fire, and blood was dripping from his seven apertures.

It should be known that Ancestral King blood was greatly nutritious, and what Ling Han had gotten was from those in Fourteenth Lotus and below, and not this was Heavenly Venerate blood, so it was naturally incredibly overwhelming. Thankfully, when Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had wiped the blood on Ling Han’s body, he had already erased the murderous aura contained within, or Ling Han would not be able to bear it, even if he was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate right now.

But the benefits were endless. This was Heavenly Venerate blood, and what Heavenly Venerate would extract their own blood to nourish someone else?

If it were not for the fact that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had been bleeding from being attacked, he naturally would not waste it, either. As for now? It would be a waste if he did, so it would be better that he use it on Ling Han instead.

“Ah!” Ling Han released a loud shout. The Heavenly Venerate blood entered his body, turning into gushing lava. This power was too shocking, and he felt incredible agony as if his whole body was about to explode.

But the boundless great power of heaven and earth was modifying his physique. This was similar to Void Particle Energy, but it was clear that the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had not grasped it. He was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, so what he possessed was the unique power of the Celestial Realm.

Even in such agony, Ling Han was still carefully experiencing it because this was an incredibly rare opportunity.

He touched this power to establish foundations for the day when he would advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier in the future.

…When a Heavenly Venerate ascended Dao, they would definitely have to grasp this kind of unique power. This was the basis of a Heavenly Venerate, and was also eternally engraved in his bones, signifying that he would be a person of this realm forever.

Whichever realm they ascended Dao in, the unique mark of that realm would then be emblazoned on them.

With his present power of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, Ling Han was qualified to make a slight comparison, and realized that this unique power of the Celestial Realm was slightly inferior to Void Particle Energy.

It was just by a bit, and there was practically no distinguishing which was superior or inferior, but there was still that slight sliver of a gap.

“What nonsense are you spouting; come fight me!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s fighting spirit blazed. He had already been suppressed for over a dozen epochs. Previously, it was for the sake of escorting Ling Han back that he restrained himself from fighting, but at this moment, he only felt the fiery emotions of wanting to have an intense battle to his heart’s content.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable spoke no further, and a string of purple bells appeared above his head. The Intent Realm of primordial age and history flowed out. Upon closer look, phoenixes and dragons were entwined on these purple bells.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le looked, and couldn’t help but clench his fists, looking furious. “You have actually refined both Ancestor Dragon and Ancestor Phoenix!”

The two of them were living beings that were from the first batch of creatures that came into being when the realm was first created, and were also the strongest beings among them. They were practically capable of representing the Celestial Tool, yet their spirits had been plucked out by the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable to increase the might of his own precious Tool.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable smiled faintly. “I have never forged my own precious Tool, because I have been waiting for this Ancestor Dragon and Ancestor Phoenix to reach the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier so that I could refine them into my Ten Thousand Dragon Heavenly Phoenix Bells.”

When these words fell, everyone was speechless.

Ancestor Dragon and Ancestor Phoenix were both two of the strongest among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and there was a chance that they could take that final step. It was rumored that they had been in seclusion for the last few epochs, and a great many Celestial Kings were also filled with anticipation about this. Once the two of them appeared, there might be another two Heavenly Venerates added to the ranks of the Celestial Realm.

But now?

As it turned out, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had actually extracted the spirits of these two powerful Celestial Kings, and turned them into his precious Tools.

He had gone too far!

But who would dare say anything?

“At first, I had wanted to refine your corpse after your death to increase the might of the Ten Thousand Dragon Heavenly Phoenix Bells, but since you are so stubborn, I will refine you directly. Being irrigated by the blood essence of a Heavenly Venerate, this precious Tool’s might will definitely become even stronger!” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable declared wickedly.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was outraged, his black locks all fluttering upwards. He had not thought that the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable actually had designs on him, and planned to refine his corpse for his precious Tool after his death.

However, both great Heavenly Venerates were already going all out. By himself, he was weak, and he was severely injured at that, so how was he supposed to counter them?

He had always been unhindered for his whole life, and what crisis or danger had he not encountered before? Even when the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm were right at their borders, he had still forged on without fear, and in the end successfully halted their enemies outside their borders.

Yet now he discovered that there was really no way out for him.

Why had this damn power of heaven and earth still not reached its limit yet so that these two great Heavenly Venerates would refrain from acting to prevent harm to themselves, and not dare to wreak further destruction? Otherwise, the three of them could only die together.

“We should end this now!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate charged out, sword in hand, the aura of a great emperor flooding out.

Boom!

Ling Han’s body bounced out of nowhere, releasing a frightening hum, as if his body was a battle drum that was being pounded.

“En?” Both Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate turned to look at him, sensing that his present condition was slightly unusual.

In their eyes, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was not much different from mere trash. At most, it would only take slightly additional effort for them to deal with him. However, the aura that was seeping from Ling Han at this moment surpassed Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

It was not the blood of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, but rather something in his body seemed like it was about to be revived.

“Ah!” Ling Han roared, his chest splitting apart, and a black tower appeared abruptly.

“Yuan Sheng!” In the distance, Shang Zhiwei exclaimed in shock, tears streaming down her face instantly.

“Heavenly Venerate!” The large black dog had also popped out from who knew where, and jumped up and down.

Shua, shua, shua.?The Empress, Hu Niu, Liu Yutong, and the others—all those in the Black Tower—were tossed out, including things like Star Stones and Ancestral King blood.?Xiu, the Black Tower rapidly grew in size, turning into a nine-storey tower that was filled with an intimidating ancient aura.

“Yuan Sheng, you have already died. What might could a precious Tool have?” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable said coldly.

Just like they would instill a sliver of their own divine sense while they were forging their precious Tool, it was this sliver of divine sense that was activated now, allowing the Black Tower to unleash Heavenly Venerable Tier battle prowess.
