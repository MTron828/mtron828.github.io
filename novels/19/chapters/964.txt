Chapter 965: Flight

“You two really love each other!” Hu Feiyun interrupted in a very untimely fashion.

“Ah!”

Ahead of them, the last member of the group of three was also devoured in a single bite by the giant ape. The big guy had obviously not had his fill yet, as his large eye focused on Ling Han and his companions, revealing a sinister light.

“Run!”

The three of them quickly broke into a run.

Don’t underestimate Hu Feiyun just because she looked completely like the type to be a burden—her movement technique was frighteningly quick. She was directly a whole position faster than Ling Han and Shui Yanyu. The moment they started running, she was already in the lead, and took a position far ahead of them, looking like she would be leaving them in her dust at any moment.

“Faster! Faster! The ugly monster is about to catch up!” And she still managed to turn her head around to urge them to be faster, wearing an expression that clearly expressed her thought: ‘why are the two of you running so slowly?’ Hong!

A pillar of light shot out of the giant ape’s lone eye. It was filled with destructive ability that would bring about ruin, and shot towards Ling Han and Shui Yanyu. That was because the two of them were practically running side by side, and this pillar of light was wide enough to hit them both at the same time.

Ling Han made a decision on the spot. His feet paused slightly, and then he delivered a palm strike right at Shui Yanyu’s back. A gentle but massive energy surged out, which caused Shui Yanyu’s figure to speed up suddenly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But with this slowing down from him, the pillar of light instantly caught up with him. Peng, a thunderous bang rang out. The ground shook, and dirt and soil shot skywards. With the impact of the light pillar as the center, the ground itself was caving in, forming a gigantic deep pit.

“Ling Han!” Shui Yanyu exclaimed in shock, tears brimming in her eyes. How would she have thought that Ling Han would give up his life in a critical situation just to save her?

Hu Feiyun stopped as well, and consoled Shui Yanyu, “Don’t worry, Ling Han would be fine. He has even killed the large evil beast!”

... If she knew the truth, she would naturally not be so confident.

Xiu, a human figure shot out of the dust cloud. Who else could it be but Ling Han? As he ran, he said, “What are the two of you standing around stupidly for? Are you waiting for that huge Demonic Ape to make you into appetizers? I heard Demonic Apes are very perverted, so take care that you will not be captured to become his wife and bear him a pile of little monkeys.”

“Ling... Han!” Shui Yanyu was immediately gritting her teeth. And to think she was touched, sad, and furious all at the same time, but in the end, this guy was not only completely fine and unharmed, he was actually starting to mock her.

“Run!” Ling Han called out quickly. Previously, he had only ducked into the Black Tower, and had not killed off the giant ape, yet those two still had the mood to stand and chat idly?

Peng, peng, peng. The giant ape rushed out of the dust cloud as well. As the single eye swept over them, it couldn’t help but look confused. Hit with a blast from it, this tiny human was actually still capable of running around in such a lively manner?

After a momentary pause, it again ran out in pursuit.

Ling Han and his companions continued to run. As they fled, they searched around for a hiding place.

“There!” Ling Han pointed to their left side. There was a field of rocks there, forming a very complicated terrain. Furthermore, the Demonic Ape was too big, so they could just make use of this place as a spot to play hide-and-seek and shake it off their tail.

They quickly changed their course and raced over.

Xiu, xiu. The lone eye of the Demonic Eye glowed, and once more shot out destructive pillars of light. In the end, with Ling Han’s weaving in and out, all missed their target.

In truth, Ling Han very much wanted Hu Feiyun to take it on once. Who knew, it might actually summon out the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, just like how they had killed the three Demon Wolves. However, it was a huge question mark how many times they could actually use this move. What if it didn’t work? Then, Hu Feiyun would really die because of him.

Besides, the fact that the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire did not kill him once did not mean that she would not the next time. The might and intent of a ruler were difficult to predict!

Last but not least, or rather most importantly, Hu Feiyun was running faster than a rabbit, so how could he make her be hit?

Thankfully, they managed to escape into the pile of haphazard boulders in time.

Indeed, the giant ape was greatly affected. Its body was too large, so it could not squeeze into the narrow paths formed by the craggy boulders, nor could it endlessly blast out attacks. However, the boulders here were really sturdy, actually being capable of enduring the mad attacks of this Demon Ape.

Even so, the shock wave created by the streams of power was still an ordeal for Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun, who both felt like they were about to throw up blood.

Only Ling Han looked like he was completely unaffected. Only when an attack from the high extreme landed on him directly could it actually deal him damage. What could the shock wave from an attack do to him?

He guessed secretly that the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would not appear as long as Hu Feiyun was not in a life-threatening crisis.

Hu Feiyun’s battle sense was not strong, but she was very skilled in running away. She pointed ahead and exclaimed, “There! There! There!”

There was a mountain cave there.

With how sturdy the boulders here were, as long as they managed to hide in the mountain cave, the giant ape would not be able to do anything to them.

The single eye of the giant ape swept over, and it realized what they were planning. Instantly, it showed its might repetitively as its single shot out pillars of light like crazy.

This took a great effect on Ling Han and his companions, shaking them so much that they were falling and stumbling over their own feet.

“Go!” Ling Han grabbed Hu Feiyun, who had been sent flying over from ahead, and tossed her into the mountain cave first with a strong throw. Then, he took a large stride to the left, and pulled Shui Yanyu into his arms.

The physique of these two women was not on the same level as his. Suffering the impact from the shock wave left by the light pillars attacking, their movement techniques were completely interrupted. Hong!

The giant ape had also grabbed at them, wanting to capture both Ling Han and Shui Yanyu in a single move.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han humphed. Pressing his left hand, he caused the divine patterns of gravity to take effect.

Weng, the large hand that the giant ape had stretched out was instantly affected. With a bang, it fell, missing Ling Han by nearly one meter; the wind the impact produced caused his clothes to flutter.

Ling Han did not have the time to let go of Shui Yanyu; clasping her, he scrambled into the mountain cave.

“Ang!” The giant ape released a furious roar.

It could crush these little worms who knew how many times with its power, yet it actually did not manage to capture a single one of them on the whole way here. It was about to go mad with fury.

It dug at the opening of the cave furiously, wanting to dig out the mountain cave by force. Yet, its brute force had lost effect at this time. This mountain cave was incredibly sturdy. It crouched down, stretched out a long and wide finger, and poked it into the cave opening.

“Quick! Quick! Quick!” Ling Han retreated, continuing to circulate the divine patterns of gravity with all his might to affect that huge finger whilst he continued to urge Hu Feiyun to run faster.

“There is a turn ahead!” Hu Feiyun called out in pleasant surprise, and hurriedly followed it.

Ling Han quickly retreated back in as well. Ultimately, it was he who was affecting that huge finger, or they would have long since been chased down.

Peng!

The giant ape did not know that they had turned; its finger continued to move ahead, and soon hit the stone wall at the end of the path. The impact was enough to cause this giant ape to roar out in pain. The rocks here were really too hard.

Only then did it realize that Ling Han and his companions had turned; it quickly crooked its finger and started digging again.

“Retreat, retreat further back,” Ling Han called out.

“We can’t, we’re at the end!” Hu Feiyun called out from behind them. Her back was already stuck onto the wall.

Peng, Ling Han crashed into her, and then he squeezed back as much as he could.

The finger of the giant ape was still digging, and was just half a meter away from them. They could clearly see the sharp claw on the finger. If they were directly touched, even Ling Han would be injured despite his physique.

The sharp claw of an Immortal level Demonic Beast was on par with Godly metal of the same level in the first place. It was also a very valuable material; after all, there was only so much Godly metal available.

“You’re about to squeeze me to death!” Hu Feiyun shouted. Ling Han’s back was completely pressing down on her breasts.

This cave was really too narrow. There was absolutely no way for two people to stand side by side, and they could only pile up one on top of another.

And now, Hu Feiyun was at the bottom, Ling Han was in the middle, and Shui Yanyu was in front, and he still had his arms around her.

“P-pervert!” Only now did Shui Yanyu have the time to open her mouth and exclaim in low voice, her tone filled with embarrassment.

Ling Han was momentarily stunned, and only now did he realize that he had grabbed a not too appropriate place—it just so happened to be the tall mountain peaks on her chest. Who asked their size to be just right for his large hand to grab securely?
