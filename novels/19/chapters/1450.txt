Chapter 1451 Endless Mystical Powers

In front of everyone’s eyes, a smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he calmly said, “So this is the Heaven’s Will Saber? Quite interesting; it makes my head ache a bit.”

Pu!

The audience spluttered in absolute disbelief.

Though it was very rare to meet someone who had cultivated the art of spiritual attacks, it did not hinder their estimation of the strength of a spiritual attack. Gu Daoyi’s Heaven’s Will Saber was close to 30,000 meters long, and merely seeing it from afar was enough to make one frightened stiff. This kind of attack was definitely incredibly terrifying.

But after this saber struck, Ling Han actually just felt a little headache?

‘Holy sh*t, not only is this guy’s physique at the level of a freak, his spirit is also!’

Even those supreme king tiers like Long Xiangyue and Zi Chenfeng looked cautious. They definitely did not want to encounter a guy with freakish defenses like Ling Han. If they really met such an opponent, then their target would be the floating rock beneath Ling Han’s feet. They would definitely not attack him directly.

They pondered that if it was in pure attack power, they were no match for Gu Daoyi.

The sound of Gu Daoyi’s laughter naturally came to an abrupt halt. The smile on his face disappeared, and he stared at Ling Han for a very long time before he finally said, “Then take on the supreme Mystical Power that I cultivated in my fourth lifetime, Roaring Flames Incinerate the Heaven!”

Boom, endless flames surged out of his body like an ocean. But the incredibly bizarre fact was that even though this ocean of flames could spread out in all directions endlessly, its upper and lower limit was restricted in an absolute six meters wide space.

Which also meant that Gu Daoyi could not attack those more than six meters above from him nor those more than six meters below him.

This kind of flames was very frightening. Even Zi Chenfeng, Second in the World, Hong Ma, and the others were not willing to be matched up against Gu Daoyi at this moment. They all quickly moved and grabbed a floating rock, increasing their altitude.

In the midst of the fiery ocean, monsters appeared one after another. They were all formed from divine patterns and looked bizarre. Most of them were creatures Ling Han had never seen before.

This was a celestial technique, so it was extremely possible that these monsters were beasts from the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han broke into a smile, though. It should be known that he had comprehended the profound mysteries of Rising From The Ashes amidst the immortal flames, and those were not ordinary immortal flames, either. They were the flames that the Immortal Phoenix burnt itself in.

It was impossible for him to dispel the immortal flames, but it would be too easy for him to protect himself.

He was already capable of becoming one with the immortal flame, and no matter how fiery the flames were, they would not be able to wound him. It was like he was bathing in the warm waters of a pond. He would only feel relaxed and comfortable, and would not be injured at all.

He unfolded his Origin Power to protect the floating rock beneath his feet. Then, he aggressively charged towards Gu Daoyi.

‘F*ck!’

Beneath them, everyone felt numb with shock. The mere sight of those flames would cause goosebumps. Who would not guard themselves with their utmost effort when being surrounded by those flames? That was because spreading out this ocean of flames would definitely expend a great amount of energy, so the best strategy was naturally choosing defense. When the other party was worn out, they could then counterattack.

But what did Ling Han do? He charged out in attack when faced with these flames. They really did not know if they should call him courageous or stupid. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No, it seems like he is really confident!”

“My goodness, it seems like the flames can’t wound him!”

“Why do I have a feeling that these flames seem intimate to him?”

“This... The flames released by an enemy can also feel intimate towards him? This guy must be a freak!”

“A freak among freaks!”

Since it was the attack delivered by his opponent, then no matter how weak this attack was, they could only ignore it or dispel it; how could their opponent’s attack actually feel intimate towards them? That was illogical!

Even Gu Daoyi’s eyes had widened his shock. He truly wanted to call him a freak.

Ling Han arrived, and his fist shot out in attack.

He did not have as many tricks as Gu Daoyi. Though it was a punch, what surged out was not the power of the fist, but rather endless sword intent.

‘I am the sword!’

This was the enlightenment that Ling Han had attained from the attack delivered by the Heaven’s Will Saber. Sword Dao did not need to be limited to the sword. Any kind of technique was merely formality. Only power and Regulations were the fundamental qualities.

‘Since that was the case, why would I have to care how this sword strike is delivered?’

He had a kind of enlightenment, and his sword intent had also become more solid as if it had undergone a kind of transformation.

This time, Gu Daoyi was really stunned. ‘You can even be enlightened in the midst of f****** battle? Wow!’

This brat’s natural talent was beneath his, and so was his constitution. It could be claimed that all his inborn traits were inferior to himself, but his comprehension ability was too frightening, which caused him to feel cold.

In the Celestial Realm, the lifespan of cultivators was unlimited. As long as they were not killed by the Celestial Decline, then they would have enough time to polish their Origin Power and perfect themselves. However, the only shortcoming they could not compensate for was the ability of comprehension.

In other words, prodigies like himself only had a headstart and had a fast dash in the beginning. They could very quickly leave the others behind. However, cultivation was not a short run, but rather an extended marathon whose end could not even be seen.

After he had raced out a certain distance, he would slow down. That was because they were not competing in constitution or natural talent on this ultimate path, but rather in the comprehensive ability of the mysteries of heaven and earth.

Those with higher comprehensive ability might start later, but would soon catch up, and even surpass those before them!

This kind of person... could not be left alive!

Gu Daoyi’s killing intent blazed. He could not allow rivals, or even those who would overtake him, to appear on his path of king tiers.

‘Kill!’

“Mystical Power of the fifth life, Skyward Staff!” He gave a battlecry. His Origin Power condensed, and formed a golden staff in his hands. He delivered a heavy strike at Ling Han. The ocean of flames, meanwhile, was withdrawn instantly. He did not have the capability to use two supreme Mystical Powers at the same time as of yet.

Beneath them, everyone was already numb with shock.

As expected of Gu Daoyi. Every single secret technique he used was endlessly powerful. Others needed only grasp one of them, and they would be able to look down proudly on the rest of the world, but in his case, this seemed to be far from the end.

Boom, when the Skyward Staff struck, it would shatter the heavens and earth!

He was practically walking completely on the path of a tyrant. Without wasting words, one staff strike from him, and even the heaven and earth would collapse, and everything would be flattened.

The Rain Emperor couldn’t help but feel his hands itch. He really wanted to ask Ling Han to give way so he could go and fight to his heart’s content.

Ling Han also felt a noble aspiration, and declared, “This is what battle is!” He raised his hand, and similarly gathered Origin Power, which took the form of a sword that greeted the Skyward Staff in attack.

Boom!

The sword and staff crashed into another, suddenly creating a frightening shock wave that swept out in all directions. However, the affected zone was restricted to the air within a diameter of six meters, and was not allowed to go farther than that.

Ling Han’s and Gu Daoyi’s hair was fluttering, their clothing flapping loudly with the force, but neither of them took one step back in retreat.

Even if Gu Daoyi was a rank three king tier, his cultivation level had been weakened, so he was not that much stronger than Ling Han. It could be considered a battle between equals.

Peng! Peng!

The two of them retreated at the same time, and with such a clash, the floating rocks beneath their feet had begun to dissolve. If the victor was still undecided after some more time passed, they would be considered to have ended the battle with “mutual destruction”, and both would fall down the valley.

Obviously, it was impossible for the victor to be decided between the two of them in the short term, so they naturally could only separate.

Ling Han laughed loudly as he moved his hands repeatedly. One after another, flashes of sword light sliced out, and battered Gu Daoyi like the waves of an ocean.

Gu Daoyi’s eyes widened, and he asked, “Do you think that you are the only sword wielder here?” He also used his hands like swords, and attacked Ling Han.
