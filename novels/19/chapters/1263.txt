Ling Han simply smiled, and said, “I hope you won’t regret this.”

Jin Xuan chuckled coldly, and said, “Ha, you still dare to threaten me? How laughable!”

He felt that this young man was incomprehensible. Since when had a measly cultivator at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier dared to threaten him like this?

He waved his hand, and said, “Kick him out! Kick him out!”

Xie Donglai smiled coldly. This no-name commoner had dared to oppose him? He hadn’t been able to dispose of him in the tavern, but he could borrow the power of the Jin Clan to humiliate him now. He didn’t need to lift a finger.

Ling Han didn’t resist, and he allowed the two auction house workers to “send” him out the door.

He had already asked another worker to report his arrival to Jin Ming, the Jin Clan’s highest-ranking manager in this auction house. When Ling Han had proposed auctioning his Realm Spirit Stones before, it was Jin Ming who had come to warmly receive him. It was clear just how highly Ling Han was regarded.

“Heir Xie, please,” Jin Xuan said. He placed himself in a very subservient position. The Jin Clan was indeed very powerful—in fact, they were far more powerful than the Xie Clan, reaching the extent that even the imperial family was apprehensive of them. However, the Jin Clan also had far too many members. Non-direct lineage members like him had to rely on outside forces if they wanted to ascend to power.

On the other hand, Xie Donglai was only a slightly important member of the Xie Clan. He wasn’t a powerful figure who wielded great power. Thus, gaining the support of a behemoth like the Gold Origin Auction House was also very important and beneficial to him.

Thus, the two of them reached a tacit agreement to cooperate with each other. It was just that Jin Xuan was far less confident than Xie Donglai. In their relationship, Xie Donglai commanded a position of absolute dominance. From an outsider’s point of view, it was as if Jin Xuan was a servant and a lackey.

Jin Xuan led Xie Donglai into a private room. He didn’t leave after that, and he continued to accompany Xie Donglai. It was clear that he would do anything and everything to strengthen his relationship with him.

Meanwhile, Jin Ming hurriedly ordered the worker to invite Ling Han over after hearing his report. However, when the worker returned to the lobby, he couldn’t see Ling Han at all. He naturally became anxious, and he hurriedly pulled someone over to ask for Ling Han’s whereabouts. Only then did he learn that Ling Han had been kicked out.

He frantically ran out of the lobby, only to find Ling Han drinking tea under a pergola opposite to the auction house. He appeared especially carefree and relaxed. The worker breathed a sigh of relief. He had been terrified that Ling Han would leave in anger. If that had happened, the ensuing auction would have definitely become a huge joke.

“Young Master Han, the auction is almost about to begin. Why don’t you follow me back in?” he said carefully.

Ling Han smiled faintly. However, he shook his head, and said, “I was kicked out by someone. Won’t it be extremely humiliating if I return like this?”

“Young Master Han, what do you mean?” Cold sweat trickled down the worker’s forehead.

“Simple. Whoever kicked me out can invite me back in.” Ling Han smiled, and continued, “However, I was kicked out and embarrassed in front of everyone. I also lost a lot of face in the process, didn’t I?”

“I understand.” The worker didn’t try to persuade Ling Han any further. He knew that he was in no position to make decisions. He hurriedly ran back to Jin Ming, and recounted what had happened. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Peng!

Jin Ming immediately slammed the table with his hand. It was clear that he was beside himself with fury. During the past month, he had done some research on Ling Han. Thus, he knew that Ling Han was a Level Eight alchemist in addition to being the seller of the Realm Spirit Stones!

He was a Heavenly Body Tier elite, so he could naturally see through Ling Han’s disguise as well. He knew that Ling Han had the body of an infant. However, he obviously wouldn’t believe that this reflected Ling Han’s true age. Instead, he believed that Ling Han had ingested some sort of pill that reversed his growth.

This astonished him immensely. Ling Han had actually renewed his youth! Such an extraordinary pill... was unheard of.

Anyhow, just Ling Han’s identity as a Level Eight alchemist alone was enough to command Jin Ming’s respect. The fact that he was able to become a Level Eight alchemist at such a young age meant that his future was limitless.

Yet, Jin Xuan had actually dared to kick such a respectable customer out of the auction house?

He truly wanted to slap Jin Xuan at this moment. Jin Xuan was trying to acquaint himself with the rich and the powerful, yet he had kicked out the truly rich and powerful.

“Fool!” Jin Ming exclaimed with a humph. No wonder Jin Xuan was unable to run his own auction house even after so many years in the industry. How could he run an auction house with his subservient attitude toward those in power? People like him would only waste the Jin Clan’s resources to sate their own greed.

The worker remained as silent as a ghost. He didn’t dare to speak at this moment.

“Where’s Jin Xuan?” Jin Ming asked.

“He’s in the Earth Number Seven private room,” the worked hurriedly replied. He had naturally checked this before coming to report to Jin Ming.

Jin Ming stood up and walked toward the Earth Number Seven private room.

Peng!

He didn’t knock when he arrived. Instead, he barged straight in.

“Who are— Lord Jin Ming!” Jin Xuan was just about to scold the intruder, yet he hurriedly adjusted his attitude upon realizing that this was the clan’s highest-ranking manager in this auction house. Although he was also a member of the Jin Clan, his status was far inferior to Jin Ming’s. Moreover, Jin Ming was a Heavenly Body Tier elite, while he was only a Sun Moon Tier cultivator. The gulf in their abilities was massive.

“Follow me!” Jin Ming said solemnly. He didn’t want to scold Jin Xuan before outsiders. That would only succeed in embarrassing the entire Jin Clan.

Jin Xuan was completely baffled. ‘What on earth is going on?’

“Senior Jin Ming, what’s wrong?” Xie Donglai asked. His relationship with Jin Xuan was in a honeymoon period, so he naturally wouldn’t sit by idly as Jin Xuan was taken away. Thus, he immediately questioned Jin Ming on the situation. In fact, he was asking this for Jin Xuan.

Jin Ming glanced over, and calmly replied, “This is a private matter of our clan. Heir Xie, please keep out of this!” He was a Heavenly Body Tier elite, and the Jin Clan was more so a force that could rival the Imperial Empire. Thus, he naturally wasn’t afraid of Xie Donglai.

If he hadn’t been a businessman, he would have completely ignored Xie Dong Lai. After all, it was common knowledge that Heavenly Body Tier elites were transcendent above Sun Moon Tier cultivators.

Xie Donglai’s expression involuntarily changed. Jin Ming wasn’t giving the Xie Clan any face? If Jin Ming were someone else, he would definitely flare up in rage. However, the person before him was a Heavenly Body Tier elite, so what right did he have to be dissatisfied?

“You’re still not following me?” Jin Ming said coldly.

Jin Xuan didn’t dare to sit around any longer. Even Xie Donglai’s attempt to intervene had been useless, so how would he dare to raise any more questions? He obediently followed Jin Ming down the stairs and outside the auction house.

“Lord Jin Ming, where are we heading?” he asked carefully.

Jin Ming didn’t answer his question. He simply walked to the teahouse opposite to the auction house. Under a pergola sat Ling Han.

Jin Xuan faltered upon seeing Ling Han.

‘Could it be because of this brat? Impossible!’ he immediately thought to himself.

He had researched everyone attending this auction, and in terms of background, no one could surpass Xie Donglai. Thus, seeing the conflict between this person and Xie Donglai, he had naturally chosen to side with Xie Donglai. Such a decision was also in line with his clan’s benefits.

However, what was going on now?

“Young Master Ling!” Jin Ming smiled as he cupped his hands and greeted Ling Han. Although Ling Han’s status was inferior to a Heavenly Body Tier elite’s, Jin Ming decided to treat him as an equal because of his astonishing youth.

‘F*ck!’

Jin Xuan was completely stunned upon seeing this. His expression was as if he had just swallowed 100 flies.
