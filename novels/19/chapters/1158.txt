Chapter 1159: Battle to the End

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘Which of us is Han Lin?

‘Yang Hao came to look for Han Lin?’

Many people were unclear about the situation. They thought that Yang Hao had come to invite Ling Han to join his side after hearing about his victory over Wu Zhe. However, people like Gan Shiyun knew that Yang Hao definitely hadn’t come to ask Ling Han to join his side.

Gan Shiyun couldn’t help but be filled with delight. Yang Hao was finally making a move!

Zhang Long couldn’t deal with Ling Han, but would Yang Hao have any trouble dealing with Ling Han?

If Ling Han could genuinely stand up against Yang Hao, she would never, ever offend or provoke him again. Instead, she would take a wide berth every time she came across him.

Ling Han didn’t back down. He stood up, and said, “I’m Han Lin. Is anything the matter?”

Yang Hao glanced at him before saying, “I’ll give you two options. One, kowtow to me and apologize. Since you’ve killed one of my followers, you’ll become my new follower from now on. Two, I’ll belt you every time I see you. I’ll do so until you leave the sect, at which time I’ll personally kill you!”

Gasp!

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this. They had initially thought that a bright, unlimited future lay ahead of Ling Han, and there was even a chance for him to become the strongest disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect. However, everything had changed in the blink of an eye.

He had offended Yang Hao!

Just listen to Yang Hao’s words! Either submit to him and become his dog or suffer humiliation for years and be killed upon leaving the sect!

Although Yang Hao had put it in a less severe manner, saying that he would kill Ling Han once he quit the sect—such a threat was not against sect rules—everyone knew that he would act once Ling Han set foot outside sect grounds.

Did Ling Han still have a future?

“Which do you choose?” Yang Hao asked calmly.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m sorry, but I like neither of the two options.”

“Whether you like them or not isn’t important. What’s important is that I’ve given you two options, of which you must select one!” Yang Hao said in a domineering manner.

He did indeed have the right to speak in such a haughty manner.

“Heh, I’ll pick the third option—I’ll ignore you!” Ling Han smiled, and said, “When I advance to the Sun Moon Tier and reach a similar cultivation level to you, it’ll be your turn to make this choice.”

The others almost spat blood.

Offending Yang Hao was already bad enough, yet Han Lin was actually audacious enough to provoke him even further?

Meanwhile, Ling Han thought nothing of it. What else could he do? Act obsequiously and pray that Yang Hao would let him off? Impossible! Yang Hao was an opinionated person who believed that everyone in the world should submit to him. How could he take his words back so easily?

That being the case, why did Ling Han have to show him any respect?

Yang Hao chuckled coldly, and said, “You’re quite the stubborn person. However, I wouldn’t have it any other way!” He extended a hand toward Ling Han.

Weng!

Divine patterns gathered, and heaven and earth instantly lost their luster. It was as if the sky were about to collapse.

‘Powerful! Incredibly powerful!’

Before his overwhelming might, the so-called six king tiers seemed like nothing but a joke.

He was the true king; a peerless king!

Ling Han’s expression became stern, and he said, “You’re a Sun Moon Tier elite, yet you’re going to attack me inside the sect?”

“So what?” Yang Hao paid no heed to Ling Han’s words as he swatted his palm toward him.

Boom!

He made a pressing motion, and a gigantic Origin Power hand materialized in the air and pressed down on Ling Han.

There was nothing fancy about this strike, nor did he use any secret techniques. He had merely made a simple pressing motion with his hand. However, the might of this strike was harrowing, and even He Tao’s expression became apprehensive. He was certain that he wouldn’t be able to block such a strike.

There was an insurmountable gulf between the Mountain River Tier and the Sun Moon Tier—unless one reached a power of 10 stars. Even so, they would only be able to challenge the weakest of Sun Moon Tier elites.

However, who was Yang Hao?

So what if he had only just advanced to the Sun Moon Tier? He was a super genius to begin with, so how could someone one major tier below him dream of challenging him?

Ling Han would be no match for him, regardless of how freakish he was.

However, Yang Hao wanted to humiliate him?

No way!

Ling Han retrieved his Lion Seal—Shui Yanyu had naturally returned the Lion Seal and Vajra Seal to him already.

Weng!

Ling Han’s power instantly soared to the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier.

However, a divine seal was only a divine seal, after all. Thus, this “peak stage” was only the peak stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, not the pinnacle level.

Peng!

Ling Han made a punching motion, and a massive flame fist soared into the sky and slammed into the gigantic Origin Power hand.

Boom!

The gigantic hand was shattered, and the flame fist continued to soar toward the sky, exuding a petrifying aura as it did so.

“Oh?” Yang Hao was slightly surprised, and he said, “Who would’ve thought? You actually have a divine seal on you! However, this can only raise your power to the... consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Heh, you want to challenge me with such measly power?”

He stepped forward, and a devastating power instantly seeped from his body, transforming into intertwining patches of divine patterns that were as dazzling as could be.

“I reached the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier 12 years ago!” he announced proudly.

The others almost fainted upon hearing this. What kind of cultivation speed was this? Was he trying to scare them to death?!

He was the number one prodigy... He was definitely the number one prodigy in the entire history of the Majestic Heaven Sect! He had cultivated for no more than 1000 years, yet he had already soared from the Shattering Void Tier to the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier!

Not only that, but he had even cultivated each tier to a genuine state of perfection!

Even the word “prodigy” wasn’t enough to describe his absurd talent.

A slight sense of apprehension gripped Ling Han’s heart. Although his power had risen to the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier, this also meant that he no longer possessed the ability to challenge those at a higher cultivation level. Meanwhile, what about Yang Hao? He was certainly a 10-star genius, so adding a power of 10 stars to his cultivation level that was currently at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier...

Even if he were only at the early stage of the high extreme, his power could still surpass three stars beyond the pinnacle level!

This was a power that overwhelmed Ling Han’s power!

‘A power three stars beyond the pinnacle level? I should be able to remedy this.’

“Die!” Yang Hao snapped his fingers, and a streak of light instantly shot toward Ling Han.

Ling Han replied with a punch.

Peng!

The streak of light was obliterated into nothingness.

‘Huh? This power... doesn’t seem like it’s three stars beyond the pinnacle level!’

Ling Han was puzzled. The power of Yang Hao’s strike was evenly matched with his power. It definitely wasn’t three stars beyond the pinnacle level. ‘Perhaps... he didn’t reach the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier?

‘How is that possible?’

Yang Hao was honored as the number one prodigy of the Majestic Heaven Sect, so how could he not have reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier? Relatively speaking, this was the easiest pinnacle level to reach.

Ling Han roared and took initiative to attack. He and Yang Hao quickly became locked in an intense battle.

Yang Hao humphed softly, yet he didn’t dare underestimate his opponent. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After several exchanges, Ling Han became certain that his power was no weaker than that of Yang Hao. More precisely, their power was basically on the same level. He became even more puzzled, and he couldn’t help but use his mind to communicate with the Black Tower and ask for answers from Notionless Saint.

“What a stupid brat!” The Notionless Saint roared with laughter, and said, “Even if you attain a power of 10 stars at the Mountain River Tier, do you think you can still maintain a battle prowess of 10 stars after advancing to the lower levels of the Sun Moon Tier? According to your line of thought, wouldn’t it be possible to reach a power that surpasses 11, 12, or even more stars?”

‘Yeah... That’s right!’

Ling Han kind of understood, and he said, “So you’re saying that the number of stars one can surpass will drop after they advance to the Sun Moon Tier?”

“It doesn’t drop per se,” the Notionless Saint explained. “The power of the Sun Moon Tier is far above that of the Mountain River Tier, so a power of 10-stars at the Mountain River Tier can only compare to power at the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. After advancing to the first stage of the Sun Moon Tier, a power that surpasses 10-stars will become a power that can surpass six stars. This is similar to how you reached a power of 20-stars at the Shattering Void Tier. Were you able to keep these 20-stars after advancing to the Mountain River Tier?”

Ling Han finally understood. The main reason for this was because of the gulf in power that existed between each major tier of the Immortal levels. This would lead to a drop in the number of stars one’s power could surpass after they advanced to the next major tier.

10-stars would drop to six stars, so six stars would drop to three or perhaps even two stars.

‘No wonder even five-star geniuses are rare. This all makes sense now.’
