2714 Base camp

Lin Piaoxue was stunned for a moment before saying, “When I was born, it happened to be snowing, so my grandfather gave me this name1.”

A chill rose in Ling Han’s heart, and he thought that although Lin Luo was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, the latter’s naming sense was comparable to his own, which was similarly haphazard.

“I’m going back to the Realm Battlefield as well. Let me know when you’re done packing up, I’ll take you there,” Lin Piaoxue continued.

Ling Han nodded, and went to see the Empress and the Rain Emperor.

!!

After so many years had passed, the two of them had also advanced to the peak of the Eighth Heaven, and they could no longer progress to the next step based on hard work alone. Therefore, even if Ling Han hadn’t come, they would’ve gone to find Ling Han at the martial academy.

“Let’s go to the Realm Battlefield!” The two made the same decision very quickly.

“All right!”

Ling Han went to find Lin Piaoxue; they could leave at any time.

Three days later, Lin Piaoxue set off with them, riding the same carriage pulled by the golden ox formed of Divine Metal, and traversing through space all the way, but it still took them 70 years to reach their destination.

Along the way, Lin Piaoxue also gave them a detailed introduction to the situation at the Realm Battlefield.

From the perspective of the strategic situation, Hysteria still held an absolute advantage, and was gradually pushing forward the line of battle. However, with the Flaming Frost Realm being so extremely vast, there was no telling how long it would take before it completely fell into enemy hands.

As they got closer and closer to the Realm Battlefield, they found that the Regulations around them became more and more chaotic. In fact, it was even difficult to sense them.

This was also why only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could come here, because only the height of Ninth Heaven could just barely extract the Regulations for battle, whereas it would be absolutely unthinkable for other Celestial Kings.

However, it would be more likely to sense the unique power of the realm all the more under such circumstances, and they could take that last, most crucial step.

The same was true for Heavenly Venerates. With this being the place of collision between the two realms, the fundamental power was even more active, which made it all the more easier to touch and sense. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was a dangerous place, but at the same time, it was also a sacred place for breakthroughs—on the premise that one could survive.

“The battle is very fierce. Every year, a large number of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings will die, while the Heavenly Venerates aren’t untouchable, either. It is very likely that they will be killed if they meet with an encirclement,” Lin Piaoxue said solemnly.

The heaven and earth here was very special, with many layers, and the stronger the strength, the higher the cultivation level needed to withstand its power. Therefore, if Hysteria was to invade, the elites and the weaker ones that came would be divided according to their cultivation level and in various batches.

Of course, the weakest person sent by Hysteria would also be at the level of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King; it would be impossible to be weaker than this level.

“To put it simply, there are eight spatial levels in total.

“Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings like us are working on the first level because the First Tier Heavenly Venerate and above can’t exert their full power here; they would be targeted by the realm.

“First Tier Heavenly Venerate is in the second spatial level, and so on. In the eighth spatial level, the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate is overseeing things and battling against the main body of Hysteria.

“However, the space here is not absolute. There are many peculiarities. Although you are obviously in the first level, you may enter another space after passing through a cave, a lake, or a cloud, possibly arriving in the third level, fifth level, and so on.

“Once you find yourself in such a situation, don’t try to act tough. Run back as soon as possible, otherwise you will die,” Lin Piaoxue said solemnly. This was the way of survival in the Realm Battlefield, precious information obtained through countless bloodshed and sacrifices.

Ling Han and company nodded, while the large black dog eyes’s shifted quickly. If it wasn’t for Heavenborn also being here, he really would want to turn around and run away.

“Alright, always keep yourself alert, and welcome to the Realm Battlefield.”

Lin Piaoxue opened the carriage door, and was the first to jump out.

“Celestial maiden Lin!” Ling Han and company were still in the carriage when they heard someone outside greet Lin Piaoxue. They also got out of the carriage, only to see that this was a huge base camp with such towering high walls that one couldn’t even see the top.

This was the barrier against Hysteria’s troops. Every once in a while, Hysteria would gather troops to launch a fierce attack, and everyone would be defending here. After Hysteria’s army was repelled, they would go out of the city to hunt and kill the remaining wandering soldiers.

Of course, this was only the first spatial level; the same would be true for the other seven levels.

It was said that new barriers were being built behind them because they had discarded at least 20,000 barriers from the time the war had started until now, and were constantly retreating.

One day, this place would also fall, and then they would retreat to the wall behind, and a new cycle would continue.

It was just that there would be no way to retreat one day if this was the case, or in other words, when the Flaming Frost Realm had lost enough territory, it would no longer be a transcendent dimension. Would it still be able to resist Hysteria?

Just thinking about it would cause one to feel chills down the spine.

Therefore, every inch of land had to be fought for, and they would never retreat lightly. For this reason, who knew how many people had spilled their blood here, including Celestial Kings, Heavenly Venerates, and high-tier Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han and company were stunned by the city wall for a brief moment before turning to look at the person who was facing Lin Piaoxue.

It was a man with a slender figure and handsome features, giving other people an impression of being cultured and refined.

There was not much movement of aura from his body, but when his gaze occasionally shifted, a terrifying pressure overflowed from him.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

“Brother Lou,” Lin Piaoxue said calmly.

This person was Lou Tianqian, a son of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. He was keenly interested in Lin Piaoxue, and had been pursuing her. However, whether he was pursuing Lin Piaoxue herself, the Lin Clan behind her, or both was something only Lou Tianqian would know.

“Celestial maiden Lin, you are finally back. Everyone misses you very much,” Lou Tianqian said with undisguised admiration in his eyes.

Lin Piaoxue smiled. “Brother Lou, I still have some matters to attend to. I need to arrange for these people’s reporting in and their accommodations.”

“Allow me, allow me!” Lou Tianqian said quickly with great enthusiasm.

Lin Piaoxue obviously didn’t want to spend more time with him, and couldn’t stop him, either, so she had no choice but to entrust him with this errand.

“The three of you, please follow me,” Lou Tianqian said very politely.

He led the way for Ling Han and the others. This city only had a wall on one side, and it was needless to say the reason, so they didn’t have a procedure of entering the city.

However, after walking for a while, Lou Tianqian’s expression turned cold. “You all can go to the Celestial Administration to report by yourselves; just keep walking straight ahead.”

After speaking, he turned around and left.

Ling Han and the others looked at one another. This guy was indeed extremely two-faced: he showed great enthusiasm in front of Lin Piaoxue, but the moment he turned around, his attitude and expression immediately changed.

“It really makes people speechless.” Ling Han shook his head. “No wonder Miss Lin didn’t fancy him, such narrow-mindedness really makes one feel disdainful of him.”

The Rain Emperor rubbed his fists together; he really wanted to beat the crap out of Lou Tianqian, but with his current strength, he wasn’t strong enough, so it could only be considered a nice dream for now.

“Where is Heavenborn, where is Heavenborn!?” the large black dog yelled. Originally, he would be the one who cared most about this kind of thing, but now all he cared about was Heavenborn.

Ling Han nodded. “Let us go to the Celestial Administration to report first, and then go find Heavenborn.”

Celestial Administration was the command center of each spatial layer. There were two First Tier Heavenly Venerates stationed there to oversee this place. Even if a First Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t exert his full battle prowess in this place, having such a person here was in itself a deterrence.

Moreover, everyone might not obey if it was any other person.

…There were too many prodigies here; who would obey whom?
