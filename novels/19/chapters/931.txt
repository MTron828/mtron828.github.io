Chapter 932: Gathering of Geniuses

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Ninth King’s manor was bustling with noise and excitement. The Left and Right Ministers as well as the Seven Great Generals had all brought their personally selected “elites” over. There were also some government officials that were rushing about for this reason, trying to discover talented people from all over the nation in preparation for this grand occasion that happened every decade.

Additionally, the higher-ups from the various subordinate Royal Empires had all brought the geniuses of their own. If they could represent the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire in the battles, it would naturally be a great honor, and if they could lead the other geniuses and help the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire attain the first place, that would even lead to a tremendous reward from the empress.

The empress was sacred and virtuous. Not only was she the dream lover of all, she was also a supreme idol, and represented the ultimate pinnacle of cultivation and strength.

Everyone had gathered inside a garden. There were many chairs temporarily arranged here, but only the higher-ups were qualified to sit, whilst those in the Shattering Void Tier like Ling Han could only stand.

Many people had gathered; merely Shattering Void Tier cultivators numbered over a hundred. In the end, though, only 10 could represent the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire in the upcoming contest, so the competition was extremely fierce.

Li Weiwei had come as well. Naturally, she was here just to enjoy the excitement. However, because of her high status, endless people approached her to strike up a conversation. If they could marry the daughter of the Left Minister, they would achieve meteoric success in the later half of their lives.

Ling Han found a rock to sit down on in a corner, his eyes slightly closed. He was circulating the Six Techniques Return to One to absorb the Spiritual Qi in the air.

Although the effect of this kind of cultivation was not the best, he needed to make every second count. Wasting the slightest bit of time would be despicable.

“Hahaha, with I, Yang Zi, here, our Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would definitely be able to get the first place this time round!” a young man with a sturdy build announced loudly, appearing to be filled with confidence.

“Who is he?” someone on the sidelines asked.

“Oh, just a country bumpkin from the Black Flame Nation. Still, his ability is quite extraordinary as he has advanced to 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier.”

“Hiss!”

Even though Luo Ba and Ye Chengyun both possessed battle prowess of 21 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and Ling Han was capable of killing them both in an instant, in the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire—or even the whole Joint Peace Planet—20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier was still a very tall peak that very few could climb.

Hence, once they heard that this Yang Zi actually had battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, everyone naturally inhaled sharply, and accorded him great attention.

Ma Xing walked over. He had also been selected by an official as a prospective representative in the competition. After all, there were too few people that possessed King’s Qi. He walked to Ling Han’s side, and said, “They are all sitting and food is served to them, while we can only stand around. This is really too displeasing.”

‘They’ was naturally referring to the Left Minister and the others.

Ling Han could not help but grin. He had not thought that there would be so many gluttons in this world. This Ma Xing was also an amazing character. Even in such a situation, all he thought about was food; he could really be considered a weirdo himself.

“The Ninth King arrives!” It was at this moment that they heard a female servant announce the host’s arrival loudly, her tone firm and voice as loud as thunder. Astonishingly, she was an elite of the Sun Moon Tier.

Everyone stood up hurriedly. Even the Left and Right Ministers, as well as the Seven Great Generals, were no exception.

The empress had said before that seeing the Nine Kings was equivalent to seeing her. Now that the Ninth King had arrived, it was equivalent to the empress herself arriving, and who would dare remain seated in her presence?

In front of the eyes of the masses, a young woman in purple robes walked over from the entrance to the garden.

She looked to be only 18-19 years old, and was wrapped by a well-fitted long skirt, which beautifully emphasized her shapely figure, her exquisite curves on full display.

This woman was very beautiful. Even compared to Shui Yanyu, she was not the slightest bit inferior, yet she seemed to lack confidence. Being the focus of attention of so many people, a flush immediately rose up on her beautiful face, revealing her bashfulness.

She was a little shy, and when she reached the seat of the host, she gestured with her hands, and said, “S-spare me the f-formalities, all the L-Lords.”

Ling Han smiled in spite of himself. The Ninth King, with her noble status, was someone that even the Left Minister had to look up to, yet she was actually a little woman that seemed to be so easily embarrassed like this.

How amusing.

And yet, the Left and Right Minister and the others dared not be rude. They respectively paid their respects once more before finally sitting back down, giving her adequate respect.

For elites like them, something that happened 700,000 years ago might as well have happened just recently. Who would want the present Seven Generals become Six Generals, or the Left and Right Minister become a single minister?

“There is still half a month before the competition between the three empires begins. Today, we need to select the 10 representatives that will be participating on behalf of our empire.” The Ninth King had gotten slightly used to the environment. Although her beautiful face was still a little red, at least she was no longer talking with a stutter.

“I, under the command of Big Sister— er, no, Her Imperial Majesty, am responsible for selecting the 10 geniuses that will represent our empire in the competition.”

She accidentally let something slip, and her small face was completely red all of a sudden, making those who saw her feel sympathy.

She was really an alluring little demon!

The Left Minister and the others were not surprised. The Nine Kings and the empress addressed one another like siblings, and they had never avoided this issue. This was also the reason why the Nine Kings possessed such high status.

“Then, let’s begin,” the Ninth King said.

She had servants place down 10 chairs in the middle of an open space. The time was limited; after two hours, the 10 people that were seated in those chairs would be the ones chosen to represent the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire in the competition. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The rules were very simple, and that was to fight over the chairs.

Although they had to exchange blows in the garden, what kind of great elites were those seated nearby? Any single one of them could control the shock waves emanating from the battle with a single thought, and would definitely not allow the slightest bit of damage to be inflicted to this place.

At this moment, no one dared to make the first move.

They had to hold on for two hours, so those who sat first would definitely receive more challenges, or would even be ganged up on. Why should they not wait until two hours were almost up to make their move?

“Bunch of cowards!” Yang Ci strode out, and walked towards the chair arranged in the first position.

“Hold on!” Ma Xing leaped out quickly. “I quite like this place, you can go and take another one!” He did not like the other man’s behavior.

“Kaka, why don’t you switch to another seat?” Yang Ci moved, and clawed out at Ma Xing.

Ma Xing glared at him, and his King’s Qi was activated. With the exchange of a single blow, there were images of Divine Beasts interwoven, indescribably formidable.

Peng, peng, peng. Abruptly, the two of them had begun fighting.

Ma Xing’s personal battle prowess was only 19 Stars, but added with his King’s Qi, he was not any weaker than Yang Ci, who had battle prowess of 20 Stars, and the two of them were stuck in a stalemate.

The others, after a momentary hesitation, also began to fight over the seats.

Ling Han was unperturbed. All the Shattering Void Tier cultivators here added together couldn’t match him even if he fought with only one arm, so he naturally couldn’t bother to join in on the excitement. He merely closed his eyes to rest on one side, and intended to wait until two hours were about to be over—he would simply grab a random seat.

“Ling Han, are you not going to move?” A low voice rang out by his ear. Though it was very soft, it was transmitted directly into his mind, and became akin to a blast of thunder.

This was the voice of the Left Minister.

Ling Han raised his head to look, but the Left Minister was completely not even looking in his direction.

Fine, it looked like his laid-back behavior had garnered the displeasure of the Left Minister, so he deliberately sent him a mental message as warning.

‘Sigh, looks like I can only step out.’

Ling Han walked ahead whilst twisting his shoulders as if he was going through a warm-up exercise.

Since he was going to move, then he’d make it a grand one.

A smile lifted the corners of his lips. Ling Han stretched out his right hand, and endless power condensed in his palm.

Abruptly, all the higher-ups focused their gazes in his direction.
