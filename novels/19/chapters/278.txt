Chapter 279: Plans in Days to Come

Ling Han immediately put the Strange Fire into the Black Tower, only to “see” Strange Fire immediately jump joyously inside. This world was so much larger than the palm that it could only hibernate in.

Small Tower appeared, and with a weng , a flash of light enveloped the Strange Fire.

“Yiyaya!” The Strange Fire wanted to run, but it could only sway continuously, as if in fear.

‘Hopefully, Small Tower won’t torment it to death,’ Ling Han thought to himself. He stopped paying attention to the Strange Fire; ahead, the imperial palace was in sight.

Zai Xiang was already at the imperial palace’s large entrance. Seeing Ling Han arrive so slowly, he couldn’t help but reveal a shred of discontent and say, “You have the impudence to make his majesty wait so long, such nerve you have!”

Ling Han glared at him and said, “To put blame on me would be for his majesty, what the hell are you yelling for?”

“You…” Zai Xiang glared, looking fierce.

“Don’t you, oh you. I’m a high level Black Grade alchemist, even his majesty humbly calls me Grandmaster Ling. You’re so arrogant, is it because you think you’re more kickass than his majesty? Hehe, you’re the one with the nerve, Captain Zai!” Ling Han laughed.

Zai Xiang was momentarily startled. Ling Han was certainly right; a high level Black Grade alchemist was a big boss of alchemy in Rain Country, even the Rain Emperor had to respect Ling Han as a distinguished guest. However, he berated him for the sake of the Rain Emperor, but how come it turned out that he was showing contempt for the Rain Emperor…? Something was definitely wrong.

He had the utmost talent in martial arts, but lacked extremely in worldly wisdom. Led on by Ling Han, he instantly became confused.

“Since you’re rude to me, then I don’t have to give you face, either. I’m leaving.” Ling Han turned to leave.

“Wait!” Zai Xiang hurriedly chased after him and said, “His majesty wants to see you, you can’t leave!”

Ling Han glared at him, simply pretending not to hear.

Zai Xiang finally reacted and said, “Grandmaster Ling, his majesty summons you. Please follow me.”

“Be more quick-witted in the future. It’s not wrong to put your thoughts on martial arts, but you can’t cultivate all day, cultivating yourself into a dolt,” Ling Han said casually.

Zai Xiang was so angry the corner of his mouth twitched, but he could only give in, fearing Ling Han would turn to leave again.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh; it was his second life as a man, could he not control a hothead?

The two arrived once again at Main Heaven Hall. Zai Xiang went to guard the palace door while Ling Han walked in.

Rain Emperor sat on the throne, but this time, there wasn’t a Xu Ke Xin leaning by the side of his legs. Presumably, the deal she made with Rain Emperor was concluded, and with the acquirement of ten Foundation Building Pills, she already left the imperial palace, running off to some remote place to cultivate in seclusion; she’d come out again after breaking through to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier.

“In days to come, what are your plans?” Rain Emperor asked directly.

Ling Han pondered, and said, “I should be leaving Rain Country.”

“That’s right, the Winter Moon Sect is a large sect after all. This emperor can force a Flower Blossom Tier warrior to leave, but next time, if someone in the Spiritual Infant Tier comes, this emperor won’t be able to oppose them,” Rain Emperor said without any empty boasts like ‘even if a person in the Spiritual Infant Tier comes, I’d be able to hold them off’. This however did not whittle down his forcefulness.

Rain Emperor paused, and then said, “This Emperor will soon abdicate. The seventh one has unyielding integrity, but his strength is ultimately too weak.”

Ling Han nodded; no matter how hard the neck of the Seventh Prince was, his cultivation of the Element Gathering Tier was a shortcoming. Even with the grasp the power of the nation, he’d still bend before someone in the Spiritual Ocean Tier. Although Rain Country still had a Flower Blossom Tier warrior overseeing things, it could be seen from their consistent low profile that they wouldn’t intervene unless it was a crucial moment when the country was in peril.

If Rain Emperor abdicated and the Winter Moon Sect came again to demand they hand over a person, the Seventh Prince definitely wouldn’t be able bear such pressure… this wasn’t an issue of whether he conceded or not; martial arts looked at whose fist was the biggest, and Rain Emperor used his strength to expel He Zheng Chu.

“I plan on taking a stroll at the Star Brilliance Palace Hall and get an Earth Grade alchemy master certification to play with,” he said.

Across the vast lands, probably only Ling Han had the qualifications to say ‘get an Earth Grade alchemy master certification to play with.’ Even in a place like the north region, Earth Grade alchemy masters were prestigious beings—anyone needed to call them master.

However, for a Grandmaster of alchemy, an Earth Grade alchemy master certificate truly was child’s play, too easy.

He now crossed into the Gushing Spring Tier, and was not far from the Spiritual Ocean Tier. The Strange Fire’s power increased quite a bit, becoming more than capable of refining Earth Grade medicinal pills; with an Earth Grade alchemy master certificate as a protective talisman, there wouldn’t be as many people who would dare lay their hands on him in the open.

…As for covertly, it would be hard to say. If one was assassinated, the background didn’t matter—even if you were the son of someone in the Shattering Void Tier, so what?

Rain Emperor laughed and said, “You can leave at ease. This emperor will take care of Da Yuan King, and protect The Ling Family in your stead. You will always be Rain Country’s man; this emperor will make sure you have no lingering anxieties.”

“Thank you, your majesty!” Ling Han saluted with hands folded. This personal favor he certainly needed; otherwise, he could only move Ling Don Xing and the rest into the Black Tower.

Rain Emperor gave him face not because Rain Emperor had to, but because as an emperor of men, he needed to consider Rain Country as a whole. An Earth Grade alchemy master… not to mention whether or not Ling Han would refine medicinal pills for Rain Country, the reputation alone would attract countless alchemy masters’ pilgrimage.

It could be seen that hereafter, Rain Country’s strength would prosper and be the best of the Nine Nations of the Desolate North.

“If the Winter Moon Sect sends someone over, they’d get here in ten days at the fastest,” Rain Emperor reminded.

Ling Han nodded and said, “In five days, I will set out.”

“Very well then!” Rain Emperor revealed a smile. “Your accomplishments in alchemy surprise this emperor, and even your talents in martial arts shock this emperor. Live well, and perhaps, tens of years later, this emperor will see a rising star appear on the stage of the vast lands, shining and stunning the world.

Ling Han snickered. That was inevitable, even if he were an idiot at martial arts, he would still become a dazzling star based on his status as a Grandmaster of alchemy in his previous life. He also thought highly of Rain Emperor for letting go of the throne. After Rain Emperor left the Rain Country, he would lose the power of the nation, but he would also be able to focus his thoughts completely on martial arts.

He was an exceptional martial arts talent and his accomplishments in the future could be extremely shocking.

Honestly, he even had the thought of taking him as disciple, but if he were to say it aloud, he would definitely be smashed to death.

“Go!” Rain Emperor summoned him to have him leave Rain Country, so since Ling Han already had such plans, there naturally was nothing more to say.

Ling Han left the imperial palace, heading back to Hu Yang Academy. There were still five days, he had to make arrangements; he was naturally going to offer to take along Guang Yuan, Zhu Wu Jiu, and the others.

Zhu Wu Jiu and Guang Yuan had no objections, willing to leave Rain Country with Ling Han. They had nothing that would make them reluctant to leave, but Jin Wu Ji and Li Hao couldn’t let go of their families and loved ones, politely declining Ling Han’s invitation.

Ling Han didn’t force them; everyone had their own goals.

Contrariwise, Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan were awfully desperate—they followed him unequivocally.
