Chapter 1700: Enemies on a narrow road

Your mount attempted to commit a crime by crashing into us, and without asking the rights and wrongs of the matter, you immediately shouted at us and found fault; how could anyone be so overbearing and unreasonable?

The Empress’s expression immediately darkened. She was merely staring coldly at this young man, and her imperial intimidation seeped through the air. In this instant, it was as if the heaven and earth had crumbled, making one feel heavy to the point of suffocation.

The young man was also overwhelmed by this aura, but he clearly was a person that was used to being arrogant. Once he got back to his senses, he became even more furious, his head of black locks fluttering wildly, and looked as if he wanted to swallow someone alive.

What a joke, he was the most beloved descendant of the Tong Clan’s ancestor; when had he been treated with such despise from another before?

“Brother Lin, what happened?” A woman’s voice was heard from within the carriage. Very soon, a woman with a graceful figure also walked out. Her features were quite beautiful and very enchanting, yet the sight only made Ling Han feel that this was really a small world.

This woman was Liu Muyu!

“It’s you!!” At first, Liu Muyu’s complete attention was on that young man, Tong Lin, but after she happened to glance at Liu Muyu and the Empress, she immediately jumped up in anger.

The last few days were practically a nightmare!

Her cultivation level had been sealed, and she had been tossed to an old bachelor. Thankfully, with continuous threats from her, the latter did not dare use force on her, and when she burst through the seal that Ling Han had placed on her cultivation level, she immediately ran off to save her brother.

However, that brother of hers was an idiot. He had been scared witless once he had entered into that place, and only knew how to call out “no”, “no”. What was the use of that?

He had been r**ed horribly.

When she saw how her brother had developed a psychological trauma, and would immediately scream shrilly at the sight of any man, Liu Muyu’s hatred towards Ling Han had reached never before seen levels.

Why was this brother so important to her?

That was because this was not her brother at all, but rather her son! However, having a child out of wedlock was a scandal to the Liu Clan, especially when Liu Muyu was a prodigy of cultivation who could join another clan to their clan through marriage, and gain the support of a powerful force. If the scandal that she had birthed a child out of wedlock spread out, what powerful clan would want her then?

Thus, her son became her brother.

Liu Muyu indeed had her ways. She came from a One Star City, White Haze City, but in the short few days since she had entered into Black Moon City, she had already made a connection with the Tong Clan.

...The Tong Clan was a Severing Mundane clan, and their ancestor was a fourth severance grand elder. Though it was not considered a top-tier force in Black Moon City, Liu Muyu’s ultimate motive was not the Tong Clan, either. Instead, she wanted to make use of the Tong Clan to pave her entry into the upper class of Black Moon City.

And thus, she had managed to get her hands on a slot of entry into Celestial Clouds Island.

“You know them?” Tong Lin asked Liu Muyu with a dark expression.

Liu Muyu’s expression was similarly livid. She wanted nothing more than to devour Ling Han’s flesh and drink his blood! She harshly replied, “It was they that hurt Bao’er!”

“Just who are they?” Tong Lin asked first. As a profligate of Black Moon City, he was still aware that there were some people he could not trifle with.

“I met them in the secondary city.” Liu Muyu did not undermine the identities of Ling Han and the Empress, and merely related facts. However, she believed that this was enough.

As expected, Tong Lin immediately showed an expression of arrogance, and his fury increased even further at the same time.

Anyone who would stay in the secondary city had to be waiting for their application of entry into the main city to be approved, but if they had a powerful background, there was also a fast route into Black Moon City too, which was specially for the use of powerful figures.

For example, if any visitors came from other Two Star Cities, or a Three Star City had sent an envoy to pass on a command, how could it be that they would have to wait over a dozen days before entering?

And from this, it was clear that the identities of these two people were definitely ordinary; they had to have come from a One Star City—recently, weren’t they about to host a cultivation tournament? So, this fitted the timing. These two people had to be representatives that had come from some small city.

Though the Tong Clan was only a Severing Mundane-level force, they were located in the seat of power, so they naturally deemed themselves to be superior to the rest.

How could Tong Lin not be furious? A country bumpkin from a small city actually dared block the way of his mount; if this spread out, what face would he have left?

“Kneel!” he declared coldly. “Slap yourself, and don’t stop unless I tell you to!”

“Let’s go, Wife. This guy must be a retard.” Ling Han embraced the Empress, and could not be bothered to deal with this kind of brainless guy.

Tong Lin streaked out in a single move, barring Ling Han’s and the Empress’s path while furiously exclaiming, “Do you know who I am?”

“We know.” Ling Han smiled with a nod. “Didn’t I say it just now? You are a retard!”

F*** you!

Tong Lin repressed his anger, and then said, “I am Tong Lin, and the ancestor of my clan is a fourth severance grand elder, and also a four-star elder of the Black Moon Sect!”

There were many classes of elders of the Black Moon Sect, categorized according to their cultivation level. For example, a first severance would be one star, second severance would be two stars, and after they had advanced to the Dividing Soul Tier, Yang Soul would be a five star elder, Yin Soul would be a six star elder, Earth Soul would be a seven star elder, and Yang Soul would be an eight star elder[1].

An eight star elder would basically be able to stand on the same level as the sect master, but even the Black Moon Sect only had a mere three eight-star elders—perhaps there were ancient antiques that had lived in seclusion for countless years without making an appearance, but this number should not exceed as many as five.

Tong Lin’s expression was filled with arrogance. Though the ancestor of the Tong Clan was only a fourth severance grand elder, which was equivalent to the strongest elite of a One Star City, didn’t he see that there was still the official position of a four-star elder of the Black Moon Sect?

This meant that the Tong Clan’s ancestor would be superior even in the face of other fourth severance grand elders!

Ling Han smiled slightly, and countered, “So?”

What did Ling Han mean by it? Tong Lin was a little blank. After announcing such a “frightening” background, shouldn’t the other party be scared out of his wits, and he could do as he liked with them? Why was the conclusion completely different from what he had imagined?

Hiss, you guys were not acting according to the script here.

“Brother Lin!” Liu Muyu also walked over. Her eyes were filled with venom, but her expression was filled with concern as she said, “Forget it, don’t argue with them. They are very strong, I’m afraid...”

“What are you afraid of?” Not only did this persuasion not soothe Tong Lin’s fury, it spiked his flames of anger even higher. “I am Tong Lin, so how could it be that I will be unable to deal with these people?”

‘What I want is precisely this attitude!’ Liu Muyu pretended to lower her head in grievance. Without stoking the flames, how could she make it so that Tong Lin would become stubborn, and how would she make use of him to do her dirty work for her? She knew that Tong Lin was definitely no match for Ling Han, but that was fine. Tong Lin was the most beloved descendant of the Tong Clan’s ancestor, and if the latter knew that he had been beaten, how could he swallow his fury?

Ling Han swept an eye over Liu Muyu; this woman was really an evil snake. It looked like his previous punishment had been too light, and she hadn’t learnt her lesson at all. He smiled calmly, and said, “Spring chicken, just how do you plan to deal with us[2]?”

Spring chicken?

Tong Lin almost leaped up. Tens of thousands of years ago, he was already not a spring chicken, all right?

‘You can’t f****** call me spring chicken just because my surname is Tong!’ To him, this address of ‘spring chicken’ was practically a colossal insult!

...Having not had s*x for a tens of thousands, it definitely had to be because he had a problem in that area.

“In front of the prestige of our Tong Clan, you are destined to suffer the consequences of your own actions!” Tong Lin declared coldly. “I’ll give you one last chance: immediately kowtow and beg for my forgiveness, otherwise... humph!”

“There really are many retards!” Ling Han moved, and with two pa sounds, knocked both Tong Lin and Liu Muyu unconscious. He tossed them into the bushes in the distance, and then, after some thought, removed their clothes. These two naked pigs were piled on top of each other, and from the surface, it looked like they were doing that activity.

“Wife, let’s go by carriage.” Ling Han stretched out a hand to the Empress.

The Empress agreed gladly and boarded the chariot, while Ling Han steered the three-headed dragon, heading towards the castle ahead of them.

[2] 童子鸡 basically refers to a man who is still a virgin, which is a double insult, since the guy’s surname is Tong, and calling him this is an insult to his masculinity.
