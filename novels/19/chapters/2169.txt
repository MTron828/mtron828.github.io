Chapter 2170: Death!

“Damn it! The people from the Dragon Universe Palace have come over!” Chen Shuangshuang immediately exclaimed.

Upon hearing this, a worried expression instantly spread across Helian Xunxue’s face.

Ling Han observed the surroundings with his divine sense. With a shake of his head, he said, “Don’t worry, they haven’t found Ling Jianxue yet.” The cultivators were searching the houses in the village one by one, and this was proof that they still hadn’t found Ling Jianxue yet.

Helian Xunxue felt slightly better, but she immediately looked at Ling Han, and said, “Hurry, we need to think of something!”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I will.”

He let everyone down before turning to Chen Shuangshuang, and asking, “How do we contact Jianxue?”

“There’s no way to contact him right now.” Chen Shuangshuang spread her hands, and said, “I promised Junior Brother Ling to meet him in the nearby forest in three days’ time. If anyone else tries to meet up with him before this, he’ll know that they’re definitely imposters from the Dragon Universe Palace.

“In other words, even if I shout now, Junior Brother Ling will only treat it as a trap. He won’t show himself.”

It was extremely easy for celestials to change their external appearance, and it was only their aura that was hard to change. However, if Chen Shuangshuang simply shouted from the distance, it would be indeed impossible for Ling Jianxue to determine if it was truly her.

They still needed to wait for three days?

Ling Han suppressed his killing intent. In any case, he could observe everything happening in this small village with his divine sense. Thus, if the Dragon Universe Palace found Ling Jianxue, he could immediately charge forward and kill them, rescuing his son in the process.

If they couldn’t find his son, however, they would simply meet in the nearby forest in three days’ time.

With this in mind, Ling Han was finally able to calm himself down. However, his killing intent was still raging with no bounds.

These people actually dared to hunt his son?

They all deserved death!

Ling Han wore a dark expression as he strode toward the village. The others followed behind him, and even the Empress wore an extremely cold expression. There was a murderous look in her eyes.

These people dared to target members of the Ling Clan? Death!

When they entered the village, a young cultivator immediately leaped over to block them, saying, “This place has already been locked down. If you don’t want to die, hurry up and piss off!”

This young cultivator was only at the Genesis Tier, yet he wore an expression of extreme arrogance. When he saw the Empress and the others, an expression of greed and lust more so spread across his face.

Ling Han didn’t reply. Instead, he threw a simple punch.

Boom!

The young cultivator instantly exploded into a cloud of flesh and blood.

“Nineteenth Young Master!” the people in the surroundings yelped. Upon seeing this, they couldn’t help but tremble.

This young man was the 19th son of Sui Yuanliang, the palace leader of the Dragon Universe Palace. Sui Yuanliang was someone with many children, and he had a whopping 34 sons and daughters. To celestials, this was an astonishing number of offspring.

After all, the higher one’s cultivation, the more introverted their essence would be. As a result, it would also be harder for them to create offspring.

This was especially clear when looking at the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. After so many years, their bellies still had yet to show signs of swelling. It was abundantly clear just how difficult it was to have offspring.

Anyhow, Sui Yuanliang wasn’t someone who only cared about his own pleasure. He also adored all of his children, and when his 11th son had died during an adventure to an ancient site, he had killed all nine of the accompanying disciples in a fit of rage. He was a brutal and merciless person.

Now, the nineteenth young master had been killed before them. By failing to prevent this, it was easy to imagine just what kind of terrifying punishment they would face.

“Aaah…!” several of them screamed in terror as they turned around to flee. They completely forgot about searching for Ling Jianxue.

They didn’t want to die. In any case, they didn’t have any family, so there was no one else they needed to worry about. That being the case, they naturally ran for their lives.

Pu, pu, pu!

However, there were several flashes of sword light, and the fleeing cultivators were instantly sliced into pieces. A middle-aged man walked out from amid the bloody sword light, a meter-long azure sword in hand. The sword was still dripping with blood.

“Those who flee from battle face immediate execution!” he said in a baleful voice. His eyes were fixed on Ling Han. Perhaps because of the fresh blood, or perhaps otherwise, his eyes were also tinted with a hint of blood-red.

This was a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder. Moreover, he was at the third severance, and it was because of this that he was brimming with confidence.

Ling Han was completely unfazed, and he simply threw another punch.

Peng!

There was no surprise as the man exploded into a cloud of flesh and blood. Ling Han didn’t stop, and he continued to walk further into the village. A devastating aura suffused into the surroundings, bringing with it a raging killing intent.

Whoosh!

Several people shot over from the distance, and most of them were surprisingly Dividing Soul Tier elites.

This was a three-star force, so they naturally weren’t short on Dividing Soul Tier elites. In fact, the Dragon Universe Palace was an extremely powerful three-star force. Not only did they have Immortal Palace Tier elites, but Palace Leader Sui Yuanliang was even a Fifth Secret elite. Under his command were dozens of other Immortal Palace Tier elites.

“Who are you?” a Yin Soul elite roared.

Ling Han glanced over.

Whoosh!

A burst of sword light shot out from his eyes, instantly slicing the person into two.

Pu!

Blood violently sprayed through the air.

The members of the Dragon Universe Palace were all deeply astonished. The Yin Soul elite had failed to block a single strike from Ling Han? More precisely, he had failed to block a single glare?

Ling Han continued forward. Right now, he wasn’t in the mood to speak. He was in the mood to kill.

“Halt!” Someone else jumped forward and roared. This time, it was a Heaven Soul elite. From Ling Han’s previous attack, they had determined his cultivation level—he was at the Heaven Soul. Thus, Heaven Soul elites were naturally powerful enough to rival him.

“How audacious! You actually dared to kill disciples of the Dragon Universe Palace! You deserve death—” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Pu!

Ling Han threw another punch, and the Heaven Soul elite instantly transformed into a cloud of flesh and blood.

‘What?!’

At this moment, everyone was transfixed with shock. Weren’t they both at the Heaven Soul? Why was the gulf between them so great?

“He’s definitely a king tier from a large sect! It’s because of this that he’s invincible at the same cultivation level!”

“Perhaps he’s a disciple of the Heavenly Saint Palace!”

“Don’t tell me they hurried over after learning about this?”

“Impossible! If they truly found out about this, they definitely wouldn’t send just a few measly disciples.”

“Kill them! Don’t let a single one of them escape! Kill all of them!”

The members of the Dragon Universe Palace communicated with their divine sense, and they quickly turned their attention back to Ling Han and the others. There was killing intent burning in their eyes.

“What a wanton brat! You think you can act with domineering audacity just because our palace leader isn’t here?” an Immortal Palace Tier elite said as he stepped forward. His hands were clasped behind his back, and he appeared as confident as could be.

His confidence was indeed warranted. He was at the Immortal Palace Tier, so he could easily crush those at the Dividing Soul Tier. What did he need to worry about?

Ling Han glanced at him. ‘First Secret?

‘Die!’

He threw another punch, this time at the Immortal Palace Tier elite.

“Naive brat!” the Immortal Palace Tier elite roared in fury. This measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator actually dared to attack him? Just how audacious was he?

He also replied with a punch.

Ling Han’s punch transformed into a vicious tiger that bounded toward the Immortal Palace Tier elite.

Peng!

His opponent’s punch was instantly shattered. To the Immortal Palace Tier elite’s disbelief, the vicious tiger lunged at him with no obstruction. He immediately made a pushing motion, yet the flesh and blood on his hands and arms were immediately shredded, revealing his white bone.

Then, even his bone started to shatter, reduced to nothing but ashes.

However, the punch didn’t stop there, and it continued to surge forth, obliterating the body of the Immortal Palace Tier elite. He was reduced to nothing but bones, which were then also shattered into nothingness.

This was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, yet he was killed just like that. Not even a shred of him remained.

A deathly silence descended over the village.

‘This…!’

‘A Dividing Soul Tier cultivator has slain an Immortal Palace Tier elite! A Dividing Soul Tier cultivator has slain an Immortal Palace Tier elite! A Dividing Soul Tier cultivator has slain an Immortal Palace Tier elite!’

These words reverberated in everyone’s mind, causing them to forget everything else.
