Chapter 2471: Clash of divine sense

When a Celestial King moved, how could a non-Celestial King block it?

Hence, this Celestial King was naturally very disdainful. A mere Ascending Origin Tier actually dared to barge in all on his own; what could this be but an act of suicide? The Celestial King’s focus was mostly on Bewitching Maiden Rou. She was the one that could possibly become a strong opponent for him. He definitely could not allow her to enter. As long as she was restrained by the purple light, he would enjoy an absolute advantage over her.

He could see the fist that Ling Han was shooting out towards him, yet it was not even worthy of increasing his notice. This was but a mere Ascending Origin Tier; even if he had reached the height of a Pseudo-Celestial King Tier, so what? Given the word “pseudo,” there was no way his battle prowess could be considered equal to a true Celestial King’s. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Peng!

The attack landed, and a frightening clash took place.

That Celestial King instantly looked astounded. He was actually inferior to the other party in terms of power, and had been pushed backwards in a continuous retreat from the impact. He felt like his insides had been twisted and turned, and the discomfort was indescribable.

‘Impossible!’

He looked at Ling Han in astonishment. This young man was completely motionless, his expression calm, as if punching a true Celestial King back was a completely common, ordinary matter in his eyes, and it was not worthy of any excitement at all.

And in this moment of his opponent’s faltering, the Empress and the others had also entered the precious tower.

“Who are you?” that Celestial King asked, filled with surprise. How could this young man possess such astonishing battle prowess?

Ling Han smiled slightly. “I am Ling Han, and this place presently belongs to our Ling Alliance now. Do you submit?”

That Celestial King naturally would not submit, but merely Ling Han alone was enough to suppress him, what more when the other side had a Celestial King as well. He hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Please offer some guidance, sir.”

If he was forced away with just a single exchange, he would be dissatisfied, and he would not have the face to see others in the future, either. That was too cowardly.

......

“Come on then.” Ling Han crooked a finger.

That Celestial King took a deep breath, and spread out both hands, extracting a black broadsword formed of great dao. It was nine meters long, and exuded a blinding light. He looked at Ling Han, and then stabbed his sword towards him.?Boom, Regulations of Metal surged out, and a murderous aura spread.

Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He still shot out a punch.?Peng, the fist landed on the black sword, and the black sword immediately crumbled, turning into pieces that danced in the air.

That Celestial King retreated continuously, right until he was forced to stop when he reached the wall. He looked at Ling Han in shock, waves of astonishment surging in his heart. If it was claimed that he had previously underestimated Ling Han, then he had indeed exerted his full effort this time, yet he was still no match for Ling Han. The gap in strength could not be more obvious.

“Thank you for the guidance.” That Celestial King clasped his hands towards Ling Han. Immediately, he leaped out, leaving swiftly.

Merely Ling Han alone was enough to blast him to the point that he could not even fight back, so if Bewitching Maiden Rou was added into the equation, there would only be one result if he kept up the battle with no move to retreat, and that would be death!

He had come to fight here firstly to become stronger, and secondly for the sake of leaving this prison. How could he be willing to die here?

Ling Han chuckled. This Celestial King had tact. Otherwise, Ling Han would not have minded dyeing the Divine Demon Sword in blood again.

Very quickly, he found the control post of the precious tower. He inserted his divine sense, and immediately a sliver of divine sense took human form, looking coldly upon Ling Han, his might weighing down like a mountain.

“A Pseudo-Celestial King?” This figure naturally was a Celestial King, and he was a Third Heaven Celestial King at that. He was slightly surprised. The person that had conquered one of his bases was actually someone that had not even advanced into Celestial King Tier yet. A mere Pseudo-Celestial King, could it be that he did not fear that he would be destroyed by his divine sense?

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “I am Ling Han. Greetings, Lord Celestial King.”

“You dare to covet my base?” this Celestial King demanded loudly, very overbearing.

Ling Han sighed. It looked like this Celestial King was not as amiable as Ninth Descent. He showed his fists. “Lord Celestial King, since your divine sense has appeared here, doesn’t that speak volumes enough? All right then, let’s skip the nonsense. We should both be very busy, so just bring it on.”

That Celestial King couldn’t help but be enraged. A mere Pseudo-Celestial King actually dared to speak with him in this manner? However, how could someone who had attained the Third Heaven Celestial King Tier lack intelligence? He frowned slightly. “You are slightly extraordinary; this Celestial Seed is very extraordinary!”

“That is natural. This is a perfect Celestial Seed that belongs to me.” Ling Han nodded, without any modesty at all.

That Celestial King’s eyes were cold. “No matter how extraordinary you are, you are but a Pseudo-Celestial King still! Moreover, even if you advanced into Celestial King Tier, there would still be an unknown distance between the two of us. If I wish to suppress you, one move is all it will take!”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Dare I ask what is your title, Milord?”

“I am… Dark Frost!” that Celestial King declared proudly.

Ling Han nodded. “All right then. I will just aim for your bases subsequently.”

The Dark Frost Celestial King almost died of fury. Just how arrogant was this brat? He exclaimed menacingly, “You no longer have any future ahead of you!”

He moved. Though this was just a streak of divine sense, so the strength that could be unleashed was limited, this was a Third Heaven Celestial King, after all. It was just a casual palm strike, and it had stimulated a terrifying power of Regulation, which turned into countless spears of ice that blasted out madly in Ling Han’s mind.

“Humph, are you allowed to take charge in my territory?” Ling Han’s divine sense also manifested his original form, blasting out towards the Dark Frost Celestial King. His fists shot out in a series of punches, and those ice spears were instantly blasted into smithereens.

“Yi?” It was only now that the Dark Frost Celestial King experienced a shock.

Though he was just a sliver of divine sense, and his battle prowess not even ten-thousandth of the battle prowess of the original, it was enough to suppress a peak-stage First Heaven Celestial King, yet now his attack had been blocked by a Pseudo-Celestial King. Just how inconceivable was this?

Ling Han broke into a grin. “How about it? My battle prowess’s not bad, right?”

The Dark Frost Celestial King humphed. “Only so-so. If my real form was here personally, killing you would be a piece of cake.”

Ling Han spread out his hands. “Since you say so, there is definitely no way I can allow this sliver of your divine sense to return, Milord.”

The Dark Frost Celestial King almost laughed in spite of himself. Though Ling Han’s battle prowess was not too weak, it was completely impossible for him to be able to stop this sliver of divine sense from returning to the main body. Moreover, he had no plans to return to the main body and just simply hand over this base to Ling Han, either.

“Brat, your future accomplishments may be boundless, but just because of this arrogance of yours, there is no possibility that you can live that long!” The Dark Frost Celestial King moved again, both hands grasping a long spear that was formed from the Regulations of Water as he swept it out in an attack at Ling Han.

Ling Han drew up both his fists to greet this incoming attack. As long as it was not a real Celestial Tool, he naturally had no fear of a direct clash.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two fought fiercely. The Dark Frost Celestial King was much stronger; merely a sliver of his divine sense could suppress a peak-stage First Heaven Celestial King, and his Vitality Index had probably reached over 4600 points, not much worse than that of Ling Han himself.

But the problem here was that this was just a sliver of the Dark Frost Celestial King’s divine sense, after all, and was considered unrooted, so just how long could he battle for?

Half a day later, the Dark Frost Celestial King realized that it was not good.

His battle prowess was completely exhausted. Without the presence of the main body, his battle prowess could not be replenished, but Ling Han’s battle prowess was still endless. This battle between the two of them was completely unjust.

He did not want to “die” here. Though this would not have much impact on his main body, this sliver of divine sense had still obtained a lot of information, for example, about how freakish Ling Han was. He definitely had to be killed, or would ultimately become a major problem.

Xiu, his figure darted out, intending to leave Ling Han’s mind.

Ling Han humphed. “You entered my mind without my agreement, and now you want to leave… Would it really be that easy?”
