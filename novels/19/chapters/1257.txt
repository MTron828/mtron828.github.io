Chapter 1258 Followed in Secre

Ling Han wasn’t afraid of them playing tricks on him. He took the Realm Spirit Stone out briefly, and asked, “Satisfied?”

“Yes, of course!” the man said as he nodded hurriedly. “How many True Origin Stones does brother want for this?”

“How many can you guys offer?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Yan Jun and the five others whispered among themselves. After a while, they said, “There’s only a limited number of True Origin Stones on us. Why don’t you follow us to the Blazing Inferno Sect? Our seniors will naturally pay you the necessary amount.”

Ling Han shook his head with a smile, and said, “That won’t work. How do I know you guys aren’t leading me into a trap? Perhaps you’ll ambush and kill me somewhere, no?”

It was necessary to keep one’s guard up against strangers. Even though he had the Black Tower, this was no reason for him to take unnecessary risks.

“How about this. I’ll give you guys three months’ time. After three months, I’ll wait for you in the Wolf Fang City’s ‘Old Zhang’s Inn’. If you guys bring enough True Origin Stones or Godly metal, I’ll sell the Realm Spirit Stone to you. Otherwise, I’ll put it up for auction.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A malicious glint instantly appeared in one of the youth’s eyes, and he said, “Seventh Senior Brother, why don’t we just capture him and snatch the Realm Spirit Stone?”

“Mm-hm!” Two others nodded in agreement.

The man pondered for a moment before shaking his head, and saying, “How can our Blazing Inferno Sect do such things? Don’t mention it again!” He then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Brother, then this is a deal. We’ll meet in Old Zhang’s Inn in three months.”

He led the five others out. After walking far away, someone couldn’t help but ask, “Seventh Senior Brother, why didn’t we use force? Founder Mao is only a tiny bit away from reaching the Heavenly Body Tier. If we bring that Realm Spirit Stone back, Founder Mao will definitely succeed in breaking through. Meanwhile, we’ll all become heroes of the sect!”

“Humph!” The man shook his head, and said, “That brat isn’t easy to deal with. Otherwise, why would Junior Brother Yan have called us over?”

A look of embarrassment appeared on Yan Jun’s face, and he said, “I’m far weaker than that person!”

The others all cried out in astonishment. Although Yan Jun’s cultivation level wasn’t high, his battle prowess was relatively extraordinary—he was a four-star genius. In other words, only those at the high extreme could suppress him. Since he admitted to being far weaker than Ling Han, this signified that Ling Han’s battle prowess was at least at the early stage of the high extreme. In fact, it could even be at the middle stage or late stage!

“If we ganged up on and attacked him, everything would be fine if we succeeded,” the man said. “However, if we failed, that Realm Spirit Stone would have nothing else to do with us. We wouldn’t even be able to buy it from him.

“Junior Brother Liu, Junior Brother Ma, you two immediately report this matter to Uncle Qian. He’s an elder at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, so he’ll definitely be able to suppress that brat. In the meantime, the rest of us will follow him in secret. When Uncle Qian arrives, we’ll force that brat to hand the Realm Spirit Stone over.

“If he cooperates obediently, humph, we’ll spare his life. Otherwise, we’ll send him to the afterlife!”

The hearts of the five other people shivered. This Seventh Senior Brother looked gentle and easy-going, yet his disposition was cautious and sinister. He was like a poisonous snake, and those who offended him would die without even knowing how they had died.

They hurriedly acted according to the plan. Two of them left to call for reinforcements, while the remaining four followed Ling Han in secret. As they followed him, they left marks that were unique to the Blazing Inferno Sect. These would act as road signs for their reinforcements.

However, how sensitive was Ling Han’s divine sense? It wasn’t long before he realized that he was being tailed.

“As expected. One may know a person and their appearance, but will never know their heart,” he said with a sigh. In the beginning, he’d had a fairly good impression of the man. It was because of this that he had agreed to potentially sell the Realm Spirit Stone to them.

But now?

Only four of them were following him at this moment. It was clear that the other two had gone to call for reinforcements. They wanted to deal him a fatal blow.

Ling Han wasn’t afraid. Ignoring the fact that this was the Two Realm Battlefield—where Regulations behaved strangely, and decreased the battle prowess of elites as a result—he could still hide in the Black Tower. Thus, it wouldn’t matter even if their battle prowess wasn’t affected.

Moreover, Ling Han didn’t want to hide if their reinforcement wasn’t a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Instead, he wanted to fight.

In this peculiar place, he could even battle against those at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Ling Han continued to look for Realm Spirit Stones. In any case, he needed to wait three months before the Black Tower accumulated enough immortal flames again. Thus, there wasn’t much for him to do. He spent some time looking for Realm Spirit Stones, and also spent some time refining pills in the Black Tower.

This proved extremely troublesome for Yan Jun and the others. They would suddenly lose sight of Ling Han for days on end, and they would think that he had secretly fled after seeing through their scheme. However, he would mysteriously reappear after a few days. This left them all very baffled.

‘What on earth are you playing at?

‘Have you seen through our scheme or not?’

Fortunately, Ling Han didn’t disappear too many times. He would stroll through the realm most of the time, and he would occasionally come across Netherworld beings. During such encounters, he would either battle or flee, depending on the strength of his opponent.

However, Ling Han purposefully acted weaker than he was, fleeing when he came across Netherworld elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Otherwise, their reinforcements definitely wouldn’t dare to attack him if they were only in the Sun Moon Tier.

Right now, he was giving them a chance. If they stopped now, he wouldn’t pursue the matter. However, if they insisted on targeting him, he wouldn’t show them any mercy, either.

11 days passed, and in a stroke of huge fortune, Ling Han finally found another Realm Spirit Stone. However, this Realm Spirit Stone was far smaller than the one that he had found before. It was only the size of a pinky.

“As small as it may be, it’s still a Realm Spirit Stone.” Ling Han chuckled as he put the Realm Spirit Stone away. “Hmm?” He cocked his head, and said, “Have their reinforcements finally arrived?”

The four people that were tailing him had suddenly grown to seven!

He couldn’t help but sigh. He wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, yet there were always those who forced him to become a ruthless killer.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu!

Seven figures dashed over and surrounded Ling Han. They were none other than Yan Jun and the others.

An awkward smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he asked, “Guys, what’s the meaning of this? Didn’t we agree to meet in Wolf Fang City?”

The faces of Yan Jun and the five others flushed. It was embarrassing to be called out like this. However, the expression of the only elder present remained cold, and he said, “Young man, watch your tongue! Immediately hand the Realm Spirit Stone over. Otherwise, you’ll simply be asking for death.”

A pensive expression appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he retrieved both of the Realm Spirit Stones, asking, “Which one are you talking about? This one? Or this one?” He raised the Realm Spirit Stone in his left hand, and then raised the Realm Spirit Stone in his right hand.

The elder’s expression instantly became greedy, and he exclaimed, “Both of them!”

“No problem,” Ling Han said with a nod. “300 million True Origin Stones!”

The elder was infuriated, and he roared, “Brat, do you think I’m kidding around with you? If you dare to waste any more time, I’ll cut you into pieces!”

“Oh no! I’m so scared!” Ling Han exclaimed as he purposefully shrunk back in fright. He then chuckled, and said, “Fine, who’s coming to collect them?”

He gazed at each of them before pushing his hands outward, and saying, “Come on, come and take them! Don’t be shy!”
