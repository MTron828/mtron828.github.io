Chapter 2424: The Celestial King retreats in defeat

No matter how strong the Blue North King was, he was still just a First Heaven Celestial King, and was worlds apart from Heavenly Venerable Tier. How could he possibly match such ferocious might?

His right arm suddenly stretched out, and a shield immediately formed in front of him.

Peng!

The Sword Qi sliced the shield, and with a loud, crisp noise, the shield was immediately shattered. The Sword Qi continued on its original course, practically undeterred.

The Blue North King was stunned. He had not thought that mere Sword Qi would have such frightening destructive power. The defense that he had laid down might as well have been completely useless. He hurriedly turned his head to the side, and dodged the Sword Qi. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Shua, the Sword Qi swept past, and a few strands of hair quietly drifted downwards.

Ling Han had actually managed to slice a few hairs from the Blue North King’s head!

When the spectators below saw this, they felt a chill rise up from their limbs as numbness spread all over their scalps.

Heavens, that was a Celestial King, yet Ling Han actually managed to cut off a few strands of his hair! Though it was just a few strands, a Celestial King had a lofty, noble standing, and was an invincible god of war in everyone’s eyes, yet a few strands of his hair had actually been cut with a single sword strike. How could they believe this?

This was heaven-defying; this was really heaven-defying.

The Blue North King’s expression was ice-cold. Not the slightest bit of anger could be seen from his expression; only extreme calmness remained in his expression.

What person that could become a Celestial King did not have a willpower of iron?

“This power… is very astounding!” he said sincerely. Being capable of cutting a few strands of hair from his head was really hard to imagine. He was a Celestial King, and had the grace to admit this fact.

Ling Han laughed, and waved his sword. “You’re not going to tell me now that you won’t fight, right?”

“I have never backed down from a battle!” the Blue North King declared proudly. In a battle of equals, he had never feared anyone.

“Then come battle!” Ling Han charged out. The Divine Demon Sword had been instilled with Void Particle Energy, and would be able to burst out with frightening might for a short time, so he was confident that he would be able to defeat even a Celestial King.

The Blue North King had witnessed the might of the Divine Demon Sword previously, and did not dare to face it head-on at all. After he retreated, he delivered a series of palm strikes, sending out palm strikes that were as massive as mountains as they descended on Ling Han.

Ling Han casually blasted out Sword Qi.?Peng, peng, peng, when every flash of Sword Qi sliced into a massive palm, the palm would immediately crumble. It could not withstand even a single blow.

He advanced deeply, and set off in hot pursuit of the Blue North King.

The people below were all practically passing out from watching this. Just who exactly was the Celestial King here? How was it that it was an Ascending Origin Tier was attacking a Celestial King?

Their view on life was about to collapse.

Actually, Ling Han had stronger trump cards which he had not played yet, and that was the Heaven and Earth Origin Stars. It could kill even low-tier Celestial Kings. But since he had the upper hand now, he naturally would not be willing to waste such a deadly weapon. After all, he did not have many Heaven and Earth Origin Stars on him, either.

The Blue North King roared out continuously, launching ultimate moves repeatedly, but in front of the Divine Demon Sword, any technique was only wasted effort.

On the other hand, it was now Ling Han that could pose a serious threat to him, yet he could do nothing to Ling Han. With his battle prowess, if he wanted to cause serious injury to Ling Han, he would have to attack him a few hundred times in succession at least, but how could this be possibly done?

After fighting another three days, the Blue North King finally revealed fear.

Ling Han’s stamina was unending, and though the power of the Divine Demon Sword was close to exhaustion, it could gain endless replenishment, and he could not find a hole to penetrate through at all. Furthermore, under Ling Han’s continuous attacks, he had also been struck quite a number of times by the Sword Qi, so he was now covered with wounds, Celestial King blood spurting everywhere.

“Don’t let it go to waste!” Ling Han moved, and gathered the blood that spilled from the Blue North King. Though this was not Celestial King blood essence, it was still extremely valuable, and was not too inferior as compared to a Celestial King Tier Great Herb.

The Blue North King’s face was livid with fury. ‘You f***** gather my blood right in front of me. Is there anyone else like you?’

Those watching below were also speechless. What kind of person was this? To do something so despicable, was he planning to become deadly enemies with the Blue North King?

“Good! Good! Good!” The Blue North King’s whole body was trembling. He bounced back in retreat, and endless golden light surged out, forming golden mountains in front of him which blocked the Sword Qi one after another. He gritted his teeth, then actually turned, and left. He had abandoned even his pride as a Celestial King.

He understood that if things went on in this manner, he would still be unable to kill Ling Han. Instead, it would place himself in a dangerous position. Then, he might as well cease the battle.

Of course, he was definitely not going to let this go.

Xiu, he left in a flurry of divine light that filled the skies, and was instantly gone from sight.

‘This…!’

Everyone could not speak. A Celestial King had actually been forced to flee.

He had fled!

Who would have believed this?

Even if they saw it with their own eyes, it felt like they were dreaming. If they heard others speak of this, they would definitely think that this was an extremely ridiculous joke.

Ling Han withdrew his sword and stood, making no attempt to pursue.

Firstly, his goal was the celestial fruits, and secondly… he would not be able to catch up.

His battle prowess was actually slightly weaker than that of the Celestial King Tier, but the Divine Demon Sword was really too powerful now, and that was why he had attained such glorious accomplishments. Otherwise, it should be him that could not do anything against the Blue North King, though the Blue North King would not be able to kill him, either.

“Husband!”

“Ling Han!”

Hu Niu and the other women all pounced. Though Ling Han had even killed Celestial Kings previously, for their own safety, they had long since entered into the Black Tower, and had not witnessed it themselves. Furthermore, it was a display of Ling Han’s true strength this time, which was even rarer and more valuable, and they were extremely excited at this.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “All right, let’s harvest the fruits.”

“En!” The three women all nodded.

This was a familiar path for the four of them. Very quickly, they charged to the mountaintop, then climbed the cliff, and arrived at the side of the Celestial Tree.

Ling Han stretched out his hand first, and at the same time prepared himself to intercept. If this Celestial Tree was going to flee, he would move decisively, and snatch the celestial fruits.

The Celestial Tree shook gently, and endless Celestial Qi rose up in an extremely beautiful display.

Pa, a celestial fruit automatically left the tree, and fell into Ling Han’s hand.

When the celestial fruit fell into the hands of a living being, he would have to consume it as soon as possible, or it had to be concocted into a Celestial King Pill. Otherwise, it would soon evaporate into the heaven and earth.

Ling Han immediately consumed the fruit. He might not need the Celestial Seed to sprout and grow, but he could study the Celestial Seed in his mind, and grasp the Dao of Celestial King Tier in advance. In fact, he was going to gather the essence of a great many Celestial Seeds, and form the most perfect Celestial Seed.

An invincible Seed!

He stepped out of the way, and the Empress took his place.

The Empress stretched out her hand, her expression clearly bearing the domineering air that said, “If you dare not give one to me, I’ll beat you till you burst.”

The Celestial Tree shuddered slightly, and another fruit fell.

The Empress grabbed it, consuming it directly.

Hu Niu took her place. She giggled. “Stupid tree, if your fruits taste bad, Niu will burn you!”

The Celestial Tree shook again, as if it was expressing its displeasure. However, another fruit still fell.

Hu Niu got hold of it, and consumed it in a few chews. This taste was quite good, and the little girl’s eyes immediately lit up. She stretched out her hand and demanded another. “Niu still wants more!”

Those beneath them were all watching with both envy and speechlessness. There was no benefit to be gained even with more Celestial Seeds. Have you gotten addicted to the taste?

The Celestial Tree was not willing to give a second fruit, so Hu Niu could only retreat gloomily. Bewitching Maiden Rou took her place.

However, when the Bewitching Maiden Rou stepped forwards, the Celestial Tree shook and shook, and a fruit only dropped down after a very long time, as if it was hesitating whether or not to give a fruit.

This should be because the Bewitching Maiden Rou’s performance was slightly subpar, and had not completely won the approval of the Celestial Tree. However, for better or worse, she was not disappointed.

At this time, Ling Han stretched out a hand again. Naturally, there was no reason that a celestial fruit should go to waste.
