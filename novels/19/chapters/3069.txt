3070 Retreat

Ling Han and the seven ultimate elites retreated. Extermination and the others didn’t give chase.

They were all at the Seventh Tier, and they were all indestructible and undying, so what difference would it make even if they caught up?

They simply needed to guarantee that Hysteria could continue to advance.

When Ling Han and the others retreated from the main battlefield, the elites fighting on the secondary battlefield also flew over. They had no option but to do so. Following the fall of the main battlefield, Hysteria continued to charge forward and move onto the secondary battlefield. Thus, how could these ordinary Heavenly Venerates stop the charge of a transcendent dimension?

They naturally had no option but to retreat.

The last time they had performed a full-scale retreat was when Hysteria had triggered a devastating storm of energy. Now, less than one epoch later, they were forced to perform another full-scale retreat.

Just what was going on? Hadn’t Ling Han joined the battle already? Why were they still being forced to retreat?

Lin Luo revealed the reason, and this instantly caused deep astonishment and puzzlement to appear on everyone’s faces.

What was Extermination trying to do?

In any case, it was somewhat understandable that Extermination was joining forces with Hysteria. After all, one of them was the past life, and one of them was the present life. Extermination’s body had developed a new consciousness, and it wouldn’t be surprising if this new consciousness had been affected by her old one.

However, what had gotten into Chong Yan and the others?

They had come from the Genesis World of the last era, so they clearly understood the fundamental nature of Extermination and Hysteria. That being the case, why were they still willing to join forces with them?

No one was able to understand this. In the end, they could only explain it by saying that Chong Yan and the others had been bewitched.

The problem was, they were indestructible and undying Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, so how could they possibly be bewitched?

“Retreat first!” Ling Han commanded. There was already no way to turn the tables now, especially since there were two supreme Seventh Tier ultimate elites on Hysteria’s side. Meanwhile, he was the only one on their side. In terms of ordinary Seventh Tier ultimate elites, both sides had the same number. That being the case, how could they possibly block Hysteria?

This was unless more Seventh Tier elites rushed over to help them. Even then, they would only be able to slow Hysteria down by a little.

Everyone fell back in retreat. Judging by the situation, it was inevitable that Hysteria would engulf the Profound Negative Realm. How quickly it did so was entirely dependent on how quickly it could engulf things.

And after Hysteria engulfed this transcendent dimension, how would Ling Han still be able to block it?

They needed to pack their things and make some necessary preparations. That way, they would be able to immediately retreat when they were faced with insurmountable danger again.

Ling Han parted ways with Lin Luo and the others. They all had their own families, so they naturally needed to find a safe place for them first. Only after this could they discuss their next steps.

They needed to decide whether they would defend the Profound Negative Realm or retreat to the next realm.

Ling Han mulled over this as he walked.

The first question was why Chong Yan and the others had defected to Hysteria.

Since Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, this naturally couldn’t be because they were afraid of death. Instead, Hysteria had definitely promised them some benefits.

However, what benefits could they receive from doing this? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The answer most likely lay in the “World’s Core” that Extermination had made up.

Ling Han didn’t believe it, but this didn’t mean that Chong Yan and the others didn’t believe it.

They had most likely been told that they could advance to the Eighth Tier after obtaining the World’s Core. In addition to this, they had probably been enticed by the idea of breaking out of this small pond as well. These Seventh Tier elites, people standing at the pinnacle of the world, were presumably very attracted to this idea.

This was especially the case since they had already battled against Extermination for so long before this. Would they not feel exhausted both physically and mentally after all this time?

After arriving in this new Genesis World, they no longer had any friends or family to take care of or share time with. There was nothing for them to feel attached to. At the same time, many Seventh Tier elites also viewed all matter beneath them as nothing more than mere ants. That being the case, it was no surprise that they joined forces with Hysteria.

Perhaps there was one additional reason on top of all this. That was, they had suffered great humiliation at the hands of Ling Han, so they wanted to borrow Hysteria’s power to exact revenge.

Forget about it. These seven people were only minor characters in the scheme of things, so it wasn’t important why they had decided to defect to Hysteria. When the time came, Ling Han would simply suppress them with a single hand.

The most critical factor was Extermination.

What was her true identity?

After obtaining the secret of manifesting new dimensions from him, her battle prowess had been allowed to grow to a terrifying level. Moreover, she was intent on jumping out of this so-called small pond.

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han’s eyes suddenly lit up. ‘If Extermination is genuinely the same as me, then her being at the Seventh Tier should allow her to elevate a dimension to the transcendent level as well. At that time, she would possess enough power to suppress me.

‘However, this didn’t happen.

‘Extermination is at the Seventh Tier, and she’s also someone who’s lived for heaven knows how many years. Being as freakish as she is, she most likely possesses no fewer Heavenly Venerable Seals than me, either. She was further in possession of a group of dimensions before, so her cultivation speed is definitely no lower than mine as well.

‘So, she’s in possession of a transcendent dimension, yet she was still only able to rival me, but not surpass me. What does this signify?

‘She definitely possesses fewer dimensions than me!

‘In other words, she didn’t obtain the ability to manifest new dimensions!’

The glimmer in Ling Han’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. If his speculation was correct, then Extermination’s ability to rival him was because she possessed a transcendent dimension inside her. In other words, she had a qualitative advantage over him.

However, once Ling Han advanced to the Seventh Tier, he would also be able to raise a dimension inside him to the transcendent level. Or he could choose to raise more dimensions into high-tier high-level dimensions. In any case, he could definitely regain his advantage.

‘This is definitely the case. Otherwise, it will genuinely be impossible to stop Hysteria.’

He returned to his ancestral grounds, and those under the Heavenly Venerable Tier were all drawn into the Celestial Guest Residence by him. This was a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and the space inside it was so large that it could rival a low-level dimension.

As for the Empress, Hu Niu, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the others, they all sat around Ling Han as they listened to him explain the situation.

They were Heavenly Venerates, so it wouldn’t be too difficult for them to flee and stay alive as long as they didn’t directly challenge Hysteria or experience the comprehensive collapse of the Genesis World.

“What?!”

They were shocked and petrified by what Ling Han told them.

If news of this got out, it would definitely cause immense commotion to sweep throughout the entire Genesis World. It would cause everyone to freeze with fear, feeling as if doomsday were about to arrive.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable frowned, and asked, “Why are they doing this?”

“This isn’t important anymore,” Yi replied. “The most important thing is how we can stop these bastards.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. What would it matter even if they understood the reason behind Chong Yan and the others’ betrayal? Could that change the current situation?

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and said, “I’ll discuss this with Lin Luo and the others first. In fact, I’ve already drawn all of my clan members into the Celestial Guest Residence already, so you guys may as well come along with me as well.”

Before coming here, he had already agreed with Lin Luo and the others to meet up at the ancestral grounds of the Lin Clan after dealing with his personal matters.

Even though there was no one left to obstruct Hysteria, it was a dimension, after all, so it could only engulf the land bit by bit. Thus, the Profound Negative Realm was safe for the moment. However, this period of safety might only last for one billion years. Or perhaps it would even be as short as 100,000,000 years.

Ling Han led the others to the Lin Clan. Xin Fu and Bai Fan had already arrived, and Zhou Heng and Chu Hao were naturally present as well since they were Lin Luo’s disciples, and their ancestral grounds were also right next to each other’s.

They were only waiting on Wu Zhihong and Blood Rainbow.

After waiting for a dozen or so days, the two remaining Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates finally arrived.

The eight most powerful men in the world sat down, surrounded by their disciples and descendants, all of them Heavenly Venerates. They quietly listened to the discussion of the eight ultimate elites.

“In light of our current situation, what suggestions does everyone have?” Lin Luo asked. He was the owner of this ancestral ground, so he was naturally playing host to this meeting as well.

“Those bastards!” Bai Fan cursed as he slammed the table. His formidable aura seeped out, causing the Heavenly Venerates in the surroundings to become pale. They felt agonizing pain on their skin, and it was as if they were about to explode.
