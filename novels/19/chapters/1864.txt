Chapter 1865: It was still one move

“Just forfeit!” Tang Feng stated calmly, appearing to be indifferent.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I have never developed that habit.”

“If you fight with me, you will only be seeking your own humiliation,” Tang Feng continued, seeming very disdainful. He was the Holy Son of a three-star great sect, and was actually compelled to be battle through multiple levels of selections, which made him feel very insulted.

As he saw it, all his opponents should grovel beneath his feet, and respectfully deliver him all the way to the apex.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Make your move.”

Tang Feng frowned, and showed a hint of displeasure. ‘I have already repeatedly advised you, yet you still refuse to heed it.’ He said, “If I did make a move, it would not just end in a horrible defeat for you.”

“Oh, tell me about it,” Ling Han said calmly.

“You will be crippled in my hands!” Tang Feng humped, clearly angered.

Ling Han really did not know what was good for him. In that case, Tang Feng would just have to make him suffer a bit. This was just right. He could use this person as an example for the rest, and there should be no other person that dared to fight him tomorrow. They would admit defeat the moment they saw him.

Since he was asking for a beating, he would just have to beat him into submission!

He stretched out a hand, and without using any celestial technique, he simply grabbed at Ling Han. However, he was a king tier of the younger generation, so this casual movement of stretching out his hand was filled with pressure, and endless stars surged in the palm of his hand.

Even if they were sitting outside the arena, countless people felt their hearts suddenly clench as goosebumps rose all over their bodies.

This strike... was extremely devastating!

As expected of a king tier, he was strong, so strong that others would be rendered speechless.

The palm strike landed as a great star had fallen, possessing the might of destroying worlds. Yet Ling Han merely smiled faintly, and said, “Watch your feet!”

Pu, a considerable number of people spluttered.

They naturally were Cheng Fengyun and his group. They were incredibly familiar with this phrase. But the problem here was that yesterday, Ling Han’s opponents were only a rowdy mob, but today? Tang Feng was a fourth severance king tier, so how could the trash from yesterday compare with him?

Could Ling Han create a miracle?

“Ah!” Tang Feng suddenly released a sharp cry—when this palm strike of his had descended, Ling Han lightly pushed it aside, and changed the course of attack, making it land on his own foot.

Just how powerful was this strike? Boom, even if the arena had been reinforced through formations, it still trembled strongly, and Tang Feng’s whole left foot was crushed into mush.

He looked at Ling Han in shock, his face looking like he had seen a ghost. He actually forgot about his pain, and was just staring at Ling Han in a daze.

“I already told you to watch your feet.” Ling Han shook his head.

Tang Feng’s expression was bitter. With such an exchange, he already knew he was far from a match for Ling Han. He was indeed a king tier, but Ling Han was a king among kings. The gap of battle prowess between the two sides was overwhelmingly huge!

“I forfeit,” Tang Feng said, but his face also regained some vigor. His opponent had to be an heir from a Celestial King Tier-level force who had deliberately concealed his identity. It was not unjust that he had lost.

On the spectators’ seats, those that had watched this scene could not help but sigh.

When it first started, Tang Feng could be said to be awe-inspiring, but when they had really fought, he was completely outmatched!

“Have you guys made some mistake? How could he be a king tier?”

“That’s right, that’s right. Shouldn’t a king tier be invincible among his peers? That person called Ling Han is only a third severance peak stage, and is inferior to Tang Feng by a minor level, yet could defeat the latter with one move. When it comes to Tang Feng, he is a king tier of the present generation. Isn’t that a joke?”

“He must be someone having the same name!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A great many people stubbornly thought that this Tang Feng was not the Tang Feng that they thought he was, but some bore stunned expressions. They were sure that this Tang Feng was the Holy Son of Black Cauldron Sect.

Ling Han... Just who exactly was he? How could he be so powerful?

“Brother!” Shantian Wu called out to his brother, his expression filled with doubt. He also belonged to the category of people that did not know Tang Feng, and seeing how Tang Feng had been defeated in a single move, he naturally felt extreme disdain. “What kind of king tier is that, pei!”

He had anticipated Ling Han’s horrible defeat for so long, yet the result was the complete opposite.

Pa!

Shantian Jiu delivered a slap right onto his younger brother’s face. He had used so much force that the latter spat out a good number of teeth.

“Why did you hit me?” Because he was already used to Shantian Jiu’s abuse of authority, Shantian Wu actually did not look angry, and merely asked this question, very hurt.

What did he do? He didn’t do anything.

“Don’t go and trifle with that guy again.” Though Shantian Jiu resented him for failing to meet his expectations, this idiot was still his younger brother.

“Why?” Shantian Wu’s eyes widened.

“This person... is very likely an heir of a Celestial King Tier-level great sect!” Shantian Jiu had no choice but to explain to prevent this idiotic brother of his from being stubborn, and causing trouble again.

If he talked about king tiers, emperor tiers, and monarch tiers with Shantian Wu, he would not have any concept of it, but once he talked about a Celestial King Tier-level sect, he immediately understood.

That was because he knew that the clans on the top two levels were existences that he definitely could not trifle with, and they were just Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier-level forces. If it was a Celestial King Tier-level... Shantian Wu couldn’t help but shiver.

Actually, he was really just a profligate, and he was indeed very arrogant, but not stupid in the slightest.

“Brother, are you sure?” He was still a bit unrelenting.

“Don’t tell me that you think my judgment is worse than yours?” Shantian Jiu couldn’t help but feel slightly annoyed. ‘When has it been your right to doubt me?’

Only then did Shantian Wu agree, no longer daring to say anything else.

“From now onwards, do not have any further involvements with him!” Shantian Jiu stared at Ling Han for a while, and closed his eyes. After today ended, he would bring his younger brother back to the third level.

And on Cheng Fengyun’s side, the atmosphere was extraordinarily peculiar.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Cheng Fengyun, and they felt that this guy was really a jinx. Yesterday, whoever he had a high opinion of would be unlucky and lose, and that was the case today as well. He was practically a god—god of bad luck.

“Ahem!” Someone deliberately coughed, and looked towards Cheng Fengyun’s bottom.

Of course, he did not have any interest in Cheng Fengyun’s a*s. He was just reminding the latter not to forget his previous bet.

Cheng Fengyun’s expression was livid, his hands gripping tightly the armrests of the stone chair, and his eyes were practically spitting fire.

He really did not have the slightest grudge with Ling Han, but with Ling Han having “slapped” him twice in the face like this, he was really resenting him now.

...To recount, it was really baffling that Ling Han had gotten an enemy like this. He was also extremely innocent, but it indirectly proved that he indeed did have a halo of trouble, and could manage to attract trouble even in such a manner.

“I will eat it!” Cheng Fengyun gritted his teeth, accepting his loss. He was a relatively fair gambler, but he had forgotten that others had not bet anything against him at all. Even if he had won, he would not have gained any benefits.

***

Tang Feng left despondently, whilst Ling Han qualified for the next round. This caused many jaws to drop, and also caused Ling Han to truly gain the attention of many.

Some people shone so brilliantly that no matter how hard they tried to hide it, their brightness would still show and stun the masses.

When Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden left the arena, they couldn’t help but feel slightly surprised because they actually did not see Shantian Jiu and his brother.

Strange. Didn’t they say that they were going to deal with him? Where were they now?

Ling Han naturally would not wait for them. He smiled, and strode off with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. They would fight another day.

The two of them returned to their accommodations, yet saw a great many people had arrived. They represented different clans, all wanting to recruit Ling Han. Furthermore, it was not just limited to the forces of Alchemy City. There were also forces from outside the city.
