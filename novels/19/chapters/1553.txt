Chapter 1554 So it“s you

The two women were greatly inspired. The Empress immediately formed her nine doppelgangers; they all sat down cross-legged, and were boosted by the Reincarnation Tree. However, this could only accommodate 10 people, so the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had no means to cultivate. Thus, she decisively exited the Black Tower, and enjoyed some alone time with Ling Han.In any case, she had also grasped some Regulations of the Netherworld. From the surface, there was no difference between her and any ordinary being of the Netherworld.

On the eighth day, the Divine Demon Sword released a great tremor from within the Black Tower. It had finally advanced into the Saint Tier!

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. Why couldn’t his cultivation be as fast as that? If not, then it would also be good if the Empress could advance into the Saint Tier sooner.

But Ling Han was still very pleased. This time, the Divine Demon Sword’s advancement was really too amazing; it had directly skipped over the four levels of the Eternal River Tier, and became a Saint Tool.

He drew out the Divine Sword, and saw that the sword’s blade was exuding a gentle luster like the finest jade. Furthermore, there was about it a supreme air that vaguely could suppress all existence.

This was saintly might.

He drew on it lightly, and the divine patterns on the Divine Demon Sword immediately glowed one after another. However, a frightening absorbing energy was madly sucking on his Origin Power, which was comparable to him forcibly channelling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to take on the attack of a Saint head-on. It was only a couple of pulls, and his legs were already trembling with weakness.

To activate a Saint Tool, this kind of consumption was too great.

In truth, Ling Han had nurtured and created this Saint Tool with his own hands, so he should have been able to easily activate it without much effort, but don’t forget that he was presently only in the Eternal River Tier, and the martial intent that he had integrated had not attained Saint Tier.

Thus, the fact that the Divine Demon Sword could display saintly might was in truth due to the fact that it had swallowed countless Godly metal, and had therefore naturally formed saintly patterns. This had nothing to do with Ling Han. Hence, to activate this kind of saintly might, Ling Han would have to pay a very great price.

“I’ll probably be able to attack two or three times only,” Ling Han estimated.

And this was because the Divine Demon Sword was a treasured Tool that he had been nurturing all this while. If it was another person, how could they possibly activate a Saint Tool when they were only in the Eternal River Tier? They wouldn’t be able to do it even if they were sucked dry.

“This would mean having to choose,” he mumbled.

Origin Power was limited. He could focus it on either attack or defense, and it was impossible to cover both areas.

“We’ll see what the situation is. If there is enough distance, I could attack once then immediately duck back into the Black Tower, or deliver a sudden attack the moment I exit the Black Tower. If I am being targeted by a Saint, I will have to use the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to save myself.”

Another two days passed, and the time to meet with Wu Jue had already arrived. Thus, Ling Han set out with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

They had just arrived, and heard Wu Jue angrily exclaim, “You’re late, a whole 30 minutes late!”

He was very dissatisfied with Ling Han. He jumped out, and was just about to point at Ling Han in rebuke when he saw the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. His eyes involuntarily lit up, and he spread out his arms, planning to run over to embrace her.

“Hey, hey, hey, you’re not a three-year-old toddler!” Ling Han smacked the brat away. If it weren’t for the fact that he did not have any perverted expression on his face, he would not have just smacked him away.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s expression became one of disgust. This youth was a little too enthusiastic, wasn’t he?

“Sister, it’s me!” Wu Jue hurriedly called out, wearing an aggrieved expression.

‘Who are you?’

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden turned to look at Ling Han, and Ling Han shrugged. This brat seemed like he really knew them, and seemed to hate Ling Han very much, but he stuck close to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

“We’ve met at the Two Realm Battlefield,” Wu Jue continued.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook their heads. They had no memory of meeting at all.

Wu Jue’s face flushed, and he finally exclaimed, “I was that kitten!”

‘Huh?’

Ling Han immediately had some recollection. At the time, he had picked up a small beast, and drew the invasion of the armies of the Netherworld in the end. The situation only calmed when he delivered the small beast back to the Netherworld. He had deduced that this small beast was definitely no simple character. As it turned out, it was the son of a Demon Master.

Hold on, going by that line of thought, the Hysteria Demon Master or this brat’s mother should have the bloodline of a Demonic Beast, and that was why he had taken the form of a silver kitten when he was young. He only assumed human form whe he advanced into Immortal level.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and exclaimed, “So it was you! Tsk, tsk, now that you’ve met your savior, come and offer your thanks.”

“You weren’t the one who saved me!” Wu Jue mumbled, and then he began to fawn. “Sister, I have the Primordial Divine Fluid, and the Bright King Fruit, and also Clear Spirit Condensed Milk; I’ll give them all to you!”

This guy, if Zhu Xuan saw how this betrothed of hers actually fawned on another woman like this, she would probably charge over and slash him in two, and then tear him into pieces. Finally, she would crush his bones into dust which she would scatter into the sea.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook her head with a smile. The small beast had been so cute at the time, but now he had become a “bottom”. Sigh, she had completely lost all interest. It would be better for her to have her own child with Ling Han.

“This is good stuff, why would you refuse it?” Ling Han stretched out his hand. “Hand it over.”

“Pei!” Wu Jue’s attitude towards Ling Han was completely different; he despised him very much. “It’s not for you, don’t come close to me!”

“Let’s go, don’t make Master have to wait!” Mo Li spoke up, her tone neutral and completely absent of emotion.

Wu Jue was a little scared of Mo Li. When she spoke up, he immediately behaved himself, just like a little brother that was used to being reprimanded by his elder sister.

They set off. The Hysteria Demon Master was waiting on a mountain. He was a broad-shouldered man. He swept an eye over Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and then focused his eyes on Ling Han, his eyes widening slightly.

He should have seen through to the fact that there were 11 killing formations in Ling Han’s body, which brought even him, a Demon Master, some amount of surprise. But this kind of emotion was only slightly shown. For a Demon Master, all existence below Genesis Tier were ants.

Of course, if he had had the chance to chat with Hu Feng, he would not have underestimated Ling Han to this extent.

“Young man, you saved Jue’er over a century ago, and I have yet to repay the favor.” The Hysteria Demon Master smiled. He did not have the airs of a Saintly Material, and was extremely bold and unconstrained. “What do you want? True Origin Stones? Divine Fruit? Divine Pill? Saintly Material? Whatever you say, I will fulfill your wish.”

Ling Han smiled, being neither servile nor overbearing, and replied, “Senior, I helped out previously only because I had no wish to see a war erupt between the Netherworld and the Immortal Realm, and do not have any unreasonable request. Thus, you need not take this to heart, Senior.”

The Hysteria Demon Master paused, and then laughed loudly. “What a good youth. Your ambitions are quite far, and you have your own pride.”

Wu Jue mumbled something, but because his voice was very soft, no one heard what he said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

What Ling Han needed now was Saintly medicine, and it was not just one or two, but a great amount. However, it was already good enough if a Demon Master could give him one or two; how could he possibly give him a large amount?

Thus, he might as well just leave the favor there. Who knew, it might be used for some other purpose in future.

The Hysteria Demon Master waved his hand, and gathered all four of them together. A golden pathway appeared beneath his feet, and it surged towards the galaxy. As he walked, endless galaxies rapidly flashed past behind him.

Yet even so, he still walked for over a day before finally arriving at Sea Space Planet. This was on the other end from Cold Clouds Planet. Otherwise, it would not have caused a Demon Master to walk for so long to reach.

“Chaotic Demon Palace!” Ling Han looked at the colossal mass of buildings ahead of them. Rather than calling this a palace, it would be more appropriate to call it a city.

“Master!” A considerable number of people saw the golden pathway stretch over, and came out to greet them.

“It’s you!” a voice shouted by Ling Han’s ear.

Ling Han turned to look, and couldn’t help but feel rueful. It was really a very small world.

It was actually Chi Huangji!
