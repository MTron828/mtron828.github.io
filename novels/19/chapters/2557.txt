Chapter 2558: Entering the Celestial King Graveyard

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han returned to his abode first. His trip to the Celestial King Graveyard certainly wasn’t a one or two day trip. Thus, he needed to organize everything first.

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou and the other women in his Spatial Celestial Tool naturally didn’t have any complaints. They were all willing to follow Ling Han.

Ling Han went to visit the Rain Emperor, telling him about this situation. The Rain Emperor expressed that he hadn’t discovered his own path yet, so he needed to stay in the martial academy to improve his cultivation fundamentals for a while. However, he would definitely go when the time was right.

Ling Han naturally supported his second brother’s decision. He then went to visit Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the others. He also went to visit Ling Huo and the others, leaving them some alchemical pills. He then set a time limit for himself. He planned to stay in the Celestial King Graveyard for 100,000,000 years.

In these 100,000,000 years, he would be unable to leave. He could only wait for this time limit to approach. Only then would the black donkey come over to collect him. Of course, if he became a Heavenly Venerate, he could also forcefully tear open a corner of the prison to leave.

In any case, this was indeed a risky decision. Neither the large black dog nor Wally expressed a desire to travel with him. They were extremely unloyal.

Ling Han grabbed Wally, and had a detailed discussion with him for many days, asking him to analyze his cultivation path. He had explored and walked this path by himself, so it was possible that he was lacking in some detailed areas. Meanwhile, Wally possessed the most comprehensive analytical ability.

Of course, Ling Han wouldn’t believe Wally’s analysis without question. Instead, he would use it as a reference.

He naturally didn’t have time to challenge the Nine Deaths Formation again. However, he heard that Heavenborn had suddenly improved significantly, rising up the leaderboard of the fifth formation by a great amount. In fact, he even rose above A’mu and Can Yue, fully displaying his freakish abilities.

Ling Han became even more resolute. He definitely had to surpass Heavenborn in terms of cultivation. He would then pummel him and free the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s sliver of divine sense, thereby allowing him to revive.

He temporarily put down his animosity with Heavenborn, Xiao Yingxiong, and the others. With the black donkey as his guide, he set off for the Celestial King Graveyard.

“In fact, many disciples of the martial academy are in there. However, they definitely won’t reveal their identity. So just in case you come across them, you don’t need to show any mercy, either. Otherwise, you’ll be seeking death,” the black donkey warned.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. Only if he raised his Indestructible Celestial King Physique to the ninth level could he retreat with composure even against Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Otherwise, if he were attacked by countless Celestial Kings, he would definitely suffer a miserable fate.

This was clear when looking at the Imperial Void Celestial King. He was definitely an elite among Celestial Kings, yet hadn’t he been captured when facing off against the tens of thousands of metal chains?

Enough ants could bite an elephant to death. This was not to mention the great number of supreme talents in the Celestial King Graveyard.

The black donkey tore open space. Heavenly Venerates truly traveled at a terrifying speed. However, the black donkey was still extremely careful because the void was filled with dangers. It was possible that Hysteria might attack them. Even though the donkey was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, it was still very likely that it would be killed.

Fortunately, they arrived at the graveyard without a hitch.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Was the title of graveyard not a description only? Why had he been brought to a real graveyard?

“This is the entrance, dum-dum!” the black donkey chided. It brought Ling Han to a large grave before raising its hoof to press the tombstone. The symbols on the tombstone instantly lit up.

“Entering is easy, but exiting is as difficult as ascending the heavens!” it warned again. “During these 100,000,000 years, you won’t receive help from anyone. You can only rely on yourself.”

“I understand,” Ling Han said with a nod.

“Off you go!” the black donkey said, giving him a kick.

Peng!

Ling Han crashed headfirst into the tombstone. His body directly sank inside, quickly disappearing without a trace.

“Ah, I’m so eager with anticipation. After 100,000,000 years, just what kind of lofty heights will this brat reach?” the black donkey said as it rubbed its hooves.

It tore open space and stepped inside. The space fissure then instantly knitted back together, leaving only a faint ripple.

Several days later, three figures flew over. As if they were striding across time itself, they were radiating with a boundless and domineering aura.

The three people all had seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around them, signifying their level as Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings.

They were none other than Gu Heyi, Miao Hua, and Xiao Yingxiong.

After digesting the United Origin Manifestation Fruit, they had all advanced in a short amount of time, reaching the Seventh Heaven. With their aptitude as supreme monarch stars, their battle prowess was naturally far superior to this level.

“With his freakish talent, if we allow him to grow freely, his cultivation level will definitely be above ours when he returns.”

“We have to eliminate him!”

“Moreover, he harbors great secrets, and I suspect that he’s been tempered by six fundamental powers. Otherwise, there’s no way his Body Art can be so freakish.”

“We’ll kill him and snatch this secret technique. At that time, our chance of ascending to the Heavenly Venerable Tier will definitely increase greatly.”

The three of them raised their hands, placing them on the large tombstone. Symbols instantly lit up.

The Celestial King Graveyard was easy to enter but difficult to exit. Any Celestial King could open the gates to enter with ease. However, what if they wanted to exit? Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could only stare on in helplessness. Only Heavenly Venerates could tear open the restrictions with their own strength.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The three people also entered the Celestial King Graveyard.

***

Ling Han stumbled as he was kicked forward. When he stabilized himself, he realized that he had already arrived in a dark and gloomy place. The sky was filled with dark clouds, and the surrounding land was also covered in a rising black aura that transformed into all kinds of eerie symbols.

He was in no rush to leave. Instead, he familiarized himself with the environment first.

Only after a while did he stand up to observe his surroundings.

This was a desolate mountain where not a single blade of grass grew.

He unleashed his Celestial King power and advanced in a certain direction. After three days, a large city appeared before him.

Ghost King City.

These were the three large words written above the city gates. The strokes of these characters were filled with strength, and they radiated with a domineering but more so wild aura. This was the aura of a haughty and ruthless person with boundless ambitions.

Surprisingly, there were people standing guard outside the city. However, these weren’t Celestial Kings. Instead, they were Ascending Origin Tier cultivators.

Ling Han found this especially strange. Wasn’t this a prison for Celestial Kings?

However, he quickly came to a realization. There were Celestial Kings who only pursued the pinnacle of cultivation, yet there were also Celestial Kings who only cared about enjoyment. This was a land of slaughter, so it naturally inspired another kind of carnal desire as well.

As such, it wasn’t strange for Celestial Kings to bear children and have descendants.

“Halt!” Ling Han was immediately blocked as he approached the city gates.

“Do you have a permit to enter?” they asked.

Ling Han was already roughly aware of the situation. Numerous powerful Celestial Kings had formed their own territories here, and Ghost King City was one of these territories. A permit to enter was the proof of identity created by these forces, proving that one was a member.

However, the different forces didn’t forbid people from traveling around. Everything would be fine as long as they could pay the fee to enter.

Ling Han shook his head. “I only just arrived here, so I don’t have a permit.”

Upon hearing this, the guards instantly stood on alert as if they had come across a powerful enemy. Someone sent a signal, and a Seventh Heaven Celestial King immediately appeared, looking Ling Han up and down.

“What crime did you commit?” the Celestial King asked.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and replied, “I killed a member of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. I’ve been sentenced to this place for eternity.”

The Seventh Heaven Celestial King couldn’t help but feel astonished. The title of World’s Paramount Martial Academy carried far too much weight. Those who could enter were at least monarch tiers, with some of them even being monarch stars or supreme monarch stars. In fact, there were even freaks with Evolution Indices of 12.

A serious expression spread across his face, and he asked, “Whom did you kill? Why did you kill them?”

The black donkey had already discussed this with Ling Han. He was called Li Long now, and he had indeed killed a person called Zhao Ting. This information could be found in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.
