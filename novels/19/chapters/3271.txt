Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “If I didn’t have some abilities, wouldn’t I have been devoured by you scumbags until nothing would be left? How would I be able to beat up a vicious dog?”

He did not hold back at all with his words, they were truly vicious.

What was there to save face for?

The other party had bullied them to their face and even beat up Lian Xuerong. It was impossible for this matter to be resolved peacefully.

Hu Yang’s expression became even uglier. Although he also knew that prodigies were all arrogant, arrogance aside, which one of them had such a vicious tongue like Ling Han?

It was too unreasonable.

“Humph, you speak without thinking. Let me teach you a lesson!” He leaped out, and charged towards Ling Han.

This time, his strength increased to 750,000kg.

What suppression to the cultivation of First Change? Pei.

Ling Han met it head-on. Peng, the two of them clashed again, and a wave of power transformed into ripples visible to the naked eye, reverberating in all directions.

Hu Yang’s body swayed, and he retreated another three steps, while Ling Han stood still and remained unmoved.

This time, Hu Yang was really moved.

F*ck, 750,000kg of power still couldn’t suppress Ling Han?

This brat’s strength had probably reached 800,000kg.

It was too terrifying.

He suddenly had an idea. Would this person become the second Hong Tianbu?

Back then, that person had reached 1 million kilograms of strength in the Meridian Opening Tier, and from then on, his legend unfolded, becoming the nightmare of everyone in the same period as him.

Fortunately, because that person was too freakish, he only stayed in the academy for a few years.

If Ling Han would become the second Hong Tianbu, wouldn’t that mean that he would once again have to live under the endless shadow?

No, no, no. A freakish person like Hong Tianbu could only appear once in this world. There wouldn’t be a second one. Otherwise, others would not be able to live with it.

Only Hong Tianbu could reach the second limit of the Meridian Opening Tier.

Hu Yang roared and increased his power once again.

1 million kilograms of strength.

This was definitely enough to crush him.

BANG!

The two of them clashed again. This time, Ling Han was indeed no match for him. His body swayed, and he stepped back repeatedly. However, he did not sustain any injuries at all.

Ling Han’s strength was about 800,000kg. In that case, he would still have to take 200,000kg of strength from the collision. However, this was not too much of a burden for his current physique, and he could completely withstand it.

—at least withstanding a few attacks wouldn’t be a problem.

“Good job, Brother Yang!”

“Compared to our Brother Yang, you’re just trash.”

The members of the Hu Clan Gang cheered Hu Yang on. Previously, Hu Yang had been repeatedly at a disadvantage, making them feel very depressed.

Now, they could finally cheer to their hearts’ content.

Ge Qiuling found it strange, and said, “A Fifth Change Blood Transformation

Tier suppressing a Meridian Opening Tier, what’s there to be proud of?”

He was a straightforward young man. If he had any questions, he would naturally asked them immediately.

Instantly, all the shouts disappeared.

Yes, so what if he had the upper hand? What was there to be proud of?

It was merely a Fifth Change bullying a Meridian Opening Tier.

Hu Yang gritted his teeth. Since he was already shameless, what was there to

be afraid of?

He no longer held back and went all out.

When he was in the Meridian Opening Tier, he had opened up twenty meridians, and his mystical power was as high as 200,000kg. In addition, he had cultivated Body Arts, and the limit of his strength was 300,000kg, which wasn’t a simple feat at all.

Now that he had advanced to Fifth Change, his mystical power had reached 1.25 million kilograms. Although his physical power had not increased much because the materials needed for Body Arts were too expensive, it had reached 300,oookg.

Although the fusion of the two could not reach a perfect state, it was still as high as 1.45million kilograms. It was almost 50% more than an ordinary Fifth Change.

This was under the condition that his blood and Qi were not boiling. Otherwise, his strength could reach about 3-5 million kilograms—his physical power could not be doubled when his blood and Qi were boiling, but under the suppression of 3-5 million kilorams of strength, if he was to throw a punch, Ling Han would definitely be blasted apart.

Of course, he did not dare to beat Ling Han to death. Firstly, there was no such deep enmity between the two of them, and secondly, he still wanted to recruit Ling Han. Thirdly, if he were to beat Ling Han to death, the academy would severely punish him.

One million kilograms was enough.

“Brat, don’t be too arrogant. You need to know that there’s always someone better than you!” He laughed loudly, and both of his fists blasted forward like the hitting of a drum, wildly blasting towards Ling Han.

Ling Han did not fight head-on with the other party. He shifted his feet, and was only familiarizing himself with Hu Yang’s strength, capturing the frequency within. Occasionally, he would throw out a punch. The force of over 500,000kg reverberated, and even Hu Yang did not dare to take it head-on.

Tuoba Tianhuang’s face turned extremely dark as he watched Ling Han and Hu Yang fight back and forth. Then, he thought about how he had been defeated by Hu Yang in just 50 moves. Every time he took another look, he felt that his confidence had been reduced a little more.

After a hundred or two hundred moves, the battle between the two continued. Hu Yang gradually lost his patience.

He was a Fifth Change after all. Yet, he still couldn’t take down a Meridian Opening Tier cultivator after battling for such a long time. If word got out, he would lose face.

He began to increase his strength; 1.25 million kilograms.

Ling Han instantly felt the pressure. Such a berserk power bombarded him, and the strong winds it brought with it were incomparably terrifying, affecting his movements.

He planned to counterattack because after so long, he had already captured Hu Yang’s attack frequency.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just as he was about to punch, a thought suddenly flashed through his mind.

This was about the Shuttle Steps.

He had long mastered this footwork, but there were a few verbal chants that felt a little strange, as if they were inappropriate and in fact superfluous. But now, as the thought flash through his mind, he had an inspiration.

So that was how it was.

He suddenly laughed loudly. He was like a lotus in the wind, swaying gently. His entire body even floated upwards, and he was stepping on the air like a flying immortal.

This!

Everyone was flabbergasted. They had never seen such a fight before. Someone could actually fly in the air?

Hu Yang was also stunned. Ling Han could fly?

F*ck, how could they continue fighting? If the other party couldn’t win, he could just fly into the sky. How could he give chase?

However, he was, after all, a Fifth Change elite, so he immediately grasped the wisdom behind it. It turned out that Ling Han did not really know how to fly, but like a kite, he was relying on the power that he struck out to achieve the state of “flying”.

Of course, 1.25 million kilograms of strength was enough to support a person.

It was as if the violent waves could even overturn a large ship, but with just a surfboard, humans could conquer the huge waves and ride them forward.

Now, Ling Han was stepping on his “strength” wave, achieving a state of flying.

However, the problem was that even if he knew this, he could not imitate it. This was because the force was chaotic. It was as if many waves were slapping over and one could easily be overturned.

Therefore, it was possible for him to leverage on one strength wave, but it was completely impossible for him to leverage on ten or a hundred.

“Get down here!” Hu Yang shouted loudly. His punches became irregular, wanting to disrupt Ling Han’s rhythm and make him fall from the sky. However, Ling Han moved along with the “wind”, and was still as light as a feather.

It was as if he had turned into paper. No matter how strong the wind was, it could blow away the house, but it could not tear a piece of paper.

Ling Han’s control over his power had already reached the peak of perfection..
