Chapter 1147: Tasting Tea and Discussing Dao

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was naturally unafraid. In fact, he couldn’t even be bothered to pay attention to her. He casually retrieved a Divine Fruit and started chomping down on it.

This was only a Level Two Divine Fruit, so it wasn’t all that valuable. However, Ling Han was genuinely eating it as if it were just a mere fruit. Many people couldn’t help but label him as extravagant in their minds.

Gan Shiyun almost exploded in rage. This person was actually eating fruit as if he couldn’t see her at all! He was treating her threatening glare as if it were nothing!

‘Damn it!’

More and more people arrived, and when the sun rose to its peak, no other person arrived.

The stones were all taken, yet there were still some people who were standing. These were followers. They stood around the edges as they didn’t have the right to stand closer to the center.

The number of stones was definitely the same as the number of seeds. Since they were all taken, it was clear that everyone who had been invited to this gathering had arrived.

This was the first gathering of the seeds, so everyone was extremely curious about the others. Moreover, each seed was filled with confidence and belief that they were invincible. Thus, they naturally wanted to take advantage of this gathering to assert their position.

“Hehe, everyone’s arrived.” A man stood up and smiled at everyone before saying, “Perhaps some of you don’t know who I am yet. So, let me introduce myself. I’m He Tao, and I entered the sect 900 years ago.”

‘This person is incredibly strong,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He Tao’s aura was obscure, and it was as deep and as profound as the sea. It was extremely likely that he had formed a fifth Mountain and River, and doing so had allowed him to develop this obscure yet powerful aura.

Ling Han wouldn’t have thought this if he’d been on the Joint Peace Planet. However, this was the Majestic Heaven Sect, a sect that was overflowing with countless supreme prodigies. Moreover, Elder Hai Yun had said that there was a total of seven seeds who had formed five Mountains and Rivers, including him.

This statement had only encompassed the Mountain River Tier. If it were expanded to include the Sun Moon Tier, the number of people would definitely be more than seven.

“So, he’s He Tao!”

“He can definitely rank inside the top five among seeds at the Mountain River Tier.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Look, the person beside him is Wu Zhe. He’s also a seed-level prodigy. In fact, he’s on par with He Tao.”

“Together with Wu Wentong, Shi Anguo, Shen Zhu’er, and Kuang Peishan, the six of them are called the Six Small Kings.”

There were people whispering to each other, and Ling Han understood the situation after hearing their conversation. The so-called six kings were the six Mountain River Tier disciples who had formed five Mountains and Rivers.

“Haha, this is a tea tasting gathering, so of course there needs to be tea,” He Tao said with a chuckle. He retrieved a small cauldron from his Spatial Spirit Tool, and then placed a teapot on top of it. He started to brew tea.

He wasn’t using ordinary fire, but rather fire that was spitting out from his palm. There were divine patterns intertwined inside the flames, and it was clear that he was actually using the Regulations of the great dao as his fire source.

Ordinary metals would definitely be melted by such divine flames. Moreover, being as powerful as he was, perhaps even Level Four Godly metal could be slowly melted by his flames.

However, his cauldron was able to withstand these intense flames even though it looked small and ordinary. It showed no signs of melting under the intense heat of the divine flames.

‘This is no ordinary cauldron,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He wasn’t thinking about obtaining this God Tool to use as a cauldron. Rather, there was only one thought going through his mind—he wanted to slash this cauldron apart and use it to elevate the quality of his Divine Demon Sword.

Theoretically speaking, the water in the cauldron should have boiled in no time since it was being heated by such powerful divine flames. However, half an hour had passed, and not a wisp of smoke had drifted from the spout of the cauldron yet.

“Heh, there’s Extreme Night Frosty Ice inside, so it’ll take a while for it to melt.” He Tao smiled, and said, “However, our tea tasting and dao discussions will go on for four or five days at the very least. So, why don’t we discuss dao first? We can taste the tea later.”

“What? Extreme Night Frosty Ice?!”

Many people cried out in surprise. Meanwhile, some people didn’t know what this was, and they only understood after listening to the explanations of others.

“Extreme Night Frosty Ice only forms in the extreme southern regions of the Flying Cloud Planet. That place is bone-chillingly cold, and it’s blanketed by snow and ice all year round. Moreover, there are countless terrifying caves hidden under the snow and ice. If one steps over them, they might fall into the cave and be sealed in ice forever.

“Even Sun Moon Tier elites aren’t willing to go to that place. After all, there aren’t any precious Godly medicines or valuable Demonic Beasts there.

“However, Extreme Night Frosty Ice is one of the few special local products. It’s formed from the unique great dao of the extreme southern lands, and drinking such ice will allow one to comprehend the mysteriousness of ice.

“If ordinary Mountain River Tier cultivators come into contact with Extreme Night Frosty Ice, they’ll immediately be frozen. They’ll suffer grave wounds even if they don’t die.”

“As expected of Senior Brother He. He’s even able to get his hands on Extreme Night Frosty Ice! How astonishing!”

Although prodigies were generally unwilling to admit that others were more impressive than them, the truth had already been placed in front of their eyes. If they lacked even the courage to acknowledge someone else’s strength, how could they ever wish to surpass them?

Thus, everyone looked at He Tao in admiration.

He Tao smiled faintly as he continued to boil the Extreme Night Frosty Ice. “I only obtained this by luck. I was chasing an Extreme Plain Ice Fox, and I happened to enter an ice cave where I found a few slabs of Extreme Night Frosty Ice. I pondered for a while, and I figured that I may as well bring it back and brew some tea for my junior brothers and sisters to taste.”

Someone was a little puzzled, and they softly said, “It’s such a small pot; will we even get half a cup each?” The cup that he spoke of was more so the extremely small type of teacup, the kind where its content could be downed in a small mouthful.

“Don’t worry, there’s another separate space inside the teapot. Although it’s not that big, I’m sure it’s big enough to provide us with enough tea,” He Tao said with a smile.

“Brother He has provided us with Extreme Night Frosty Ice as tea-water. I can’t be greedy, either, so I’ll offer some Serene Poplar Tea Leaves. We can use it to make tea in a moment,” Wu Zhe chimed in.

Pu!

Many people instantly spluttered in astonishment. In fact, they even wore expressions of excitement and eagerness.

Serene Poplar Tea was definitely extremely valuable. It could help cultivators comprehend dao, and even Sun Moon Tier elites wouldn’t necessarily be able to obtain such tea.

As expected of a member of the six kings. The things that they casually took out could easily astound others.

Only the Rain Emperor and Ding Ping were unmoved.

How could Serene Poplar Tea move them? In terms of help to one’s comprehension, how could it compare to the Reincarnation Tree? That was a tree that could turn one day’s worth of comprehension into one year’s worth. Could Serene Poplar Tea achieve this?

Moreover, they could comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree every single day. Meanwhile, how many pieces of Serene Poplar Tea Leaves were there?

“However, there’s only a limited number of tea leaves, 10 to be exact.” Wu Zhe paused for a moment before continuing, “How about this. Those who rank inside the top 10 will receive a tea leaf in their tea. What does everyone think?”

Although the tea leaves would be placed in the teapot to begin with—giving the tea extremely good comprehension effects—how could a clear cup of tea compare to genuinely having a tea leaf in one’s tea?

Everyone nodded in approval as they rubbed their fists and prepared to fight. Since they were discussing dao, those who were more powerful would naturally receive more benefits. This was the eternal truth of the cultivation world.

The strongest would become kings!

“I’m Fang Jin. Which junior brother or junior sister is willing to challenge me?” A youth immediately leaped out and referred to everyone else as his juniors. This was a display of confidence, and it showed that he was confident in his abilities to become a senior.

“Heh, I’ll challenge you,” another youth said as he leaped forward.

“Please!”

The two of them clasped their hands in respect before immediately launching into a fight.

Their battle was extremely intense.
