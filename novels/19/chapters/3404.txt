Chapter 3405: Not Accepting Threats

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han spoke righteously, and said, “I’ll say it again, I never accept threats! Moreover, this is the territory of the human race, and you’re committing a crime here. This is a provocation to the human race.”

“Brother Gu!” He looked at Gu Xiangming. “It’s not that I don’t want to save you, but we humans can’t submit to the Demon Race!”

“Ling Han, if you don’t accept the challenge, I’ll kill him!” Bian Kun roared. Wait a minute!

Gu Xiangming’s eyes widened. This was not the case.

Bian Kun only said that if Ling Han didn’t accept the challenge, he would beat him up. He didn’t say that he wanted to kill him. However, after Ling Han said that, how did it really become that he wanted to kill him?

Ling Han was too good at deceiving others. Was Bian Kun really foolish enough to allow Ling Han to manipulate him into killing him.

Young Master Bat, don’t listen to Ling Han’s nonsense. I have a deep enmity with him, and he is deliberately using you to kill me,” he hurriedly said. “Hmph!” How could Bian Kun believe that? The human race really had no backbone. In order to protect himself, he was actually lying openly.

He looked at Ling Han, and squeezed hard with his hand. Gu Xiangming felt as if his bones were about to break, and instantly let out a miserable cry.

Brother Gu…” Ling Han pretended to be angry, and said sternly, “Bian Kun, quickly release him!”

Bian Kun felt that he was already in control of the situation, so he couldn’t help but sneer and say, “If you agree to fight, I’ll let him go.”

Impossible. I’ve already said that I won’t accept threats!” Ling Han said resolutely.

“Then are you just going to watch your friend suffer?” Bian Kun changed his grip on Gu Xiangming’s arm. Ka, ka, ka! Gu Xiangming’s bones started to groan again.

Fortunately, Bian Kun did not dare to go overboard and did not really want to break Gu Xiangming’s bones.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel that it was a pity. If only he could provoke Bian Kun into killing Gu Xiangming.

“You idiot, I’m really Ling Han’s enemy. He’s playing with you!” Gu Xiangming shouted while enduring the pain.

‘En?’

Bian Kun finally had some doubts. After all, he was a prodigy of the Demon Race. Just because he wasn’t scheming didn’t mean that he was stupid. After such a long time, he had also noticed that something was wrong.

Although Ling Han called out urgently, he was not impulsive at all. He did not look like he was watching his friend in a dangerous situation.

Could it be that he had really been played by Ling Han?

He snorted and threw Gu Xiangming aside. “What human prodigy? He’s

nothing much. He doesn’t even dare to fight me!”

Eh, he finally realized it?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Little Bat, do you really want to be beaten up?”

Bian Kun’s expression turned cold and he said, “Watch your words!”

They were the Blood Bat Clan. They had produced powerful existences in the previous era.

“Alright, I’ll play with you.” Ling Han stood up. The reason why he was willing to accept the challenge was because he had already mastered some of the Floating Wind and Clouds movement technique. He wanted to make use of Bian Kun to try it out in actual battle.

Bian Kun was stunned. He didn’t expect Ling Han to really agree. He immediately said, “You asked for it!”

He flapped his wings, and charged towards Ling Han, not giving him a chance to regret his decision.

This speed was so fast that it was actually not slower than Bao Taigong.

Ling Han s feet moved, and he activated his movement technique.

Xiu, Bian Kun pounced over but missed.

He was extremely surprised. Ling Han’s speed was actually this fast?

Floating Wind and Clouds!” he blurted out as his gaze swept across the area.

The Leopard Clan’s movement technique was famous. He recognized it at a glance.

Although Ling Han’s footwork was still very unpracticed, his movements exuded a hint of the Floating Wind and Clouds.

This… In just a short while, this human had already grasped Floating Wind and Clouds?

You must be joking!

Bian Kun was shocked. This human’s comprehension ability was simply terrifyingly high.

Not to mention him, even Princess Bixiao revealed a surprised expression. In terms of strength, even if all the people here joined forces, they might not be able to kill her with one hand. However, in terms of comprehension, even she had to admit that she was inferior.

The human race… had produced a freakish person.

Bian Kun immediately regained his confidence. High comprehension was one thing, but battle prowess was another.

He flapped his wings, and charged towards Ling Han again.

In terms of speed, the Blood Bat Clan was not inferior to the Leopard Clan.

Ling Han still didn’t make a move. He just used his movement technique. With every second that passed, he gained a deeper understanding of Floating Wind and Clouds.

His movements became more and more proficient, causing Bao Taigong to involuntarily open his mouth wide.

…In such a short period of time, Ling Han’s attainments in Floating Wind and Clouds were already not inferior to his.

Heavens, how could there be such a terrifying person?

Ten minutes later, Ling Han shook his head. He had encountered a bottleneck in his mastery of Floating Wind and Clouds. If he wanted to take another step forward, it would take a long time, and he would have to thoroughly understand every detail.

However, even so, he had reached four times the speed of sound and was not inferior to Bian Kun at all.

Ling Han roared, and launched a counterattack.

It was still the Lightning Fist. Xiu, xiu, xiu! Not only was the fist as fast as light, but the overlapping layers of power was also very terrifying.

The limit of the Lightning Fist was forty-five overlaps. Ling Han could now exert thirty overlaps, and it was still slowly increasing. Coupled with the fact that he had also entwined his attack with high-level energy, how terrifying was the destructive power of this punch?

Bian Kun immediately felt immense pressure. After barely taking on a few blows, his face had already turned pale.

What, even Bian Kun was no match for Ling Han?

All the Demon Race members could no longer sit still. Although Bian Kun’s strength could not be ranked in the top 30 among the younger generation of the Demon Race, in terms of combat ability within the same cultivation level, he could definitely be ranked in the top 10.

If even Bian Kun was defeated, then the number of people who could defeat Ling Han in a battle of the same level could be counted on one’s fingers.

After fighting for nearly an hour, Bian Kun finally lost.

In reality, Ling Han definitely did not need to win with such difficulty.

However, in order to lay a trap for the Demon Race, he deliberately controlled his own strength.

Even so, the people of the Demon Race were speechless.

Who else could suppress Ling Han?

Did they need to mobilize Inscription Tier elites? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, Ling Han was merely a Blood Transformation Tier, and had crushed two people that had an advantage of a major tier over him. So what if the person they sent out won? However, for two people who were both in their twenties, Bian Kun was already the strongest. Who else could they look for?

If they couldn’t even deal with Ling Han, then what about Hong Tianbu?

The morale of the Demon Race fell to rock bottom.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Are you guys very unconvinced? Do you really want to defeat me? Fine, I’ll allow you to mobilize Inscription Tier elites. However, you must bring out the stakes. If it’s too low, I won’t agree.”

Eh, isn’t this kid too arrogant? Does he really think that just because he defeated Bian Kun, he thinks he can look down on an Inscription Tier elite?

Princess Bixiao’s beautiful eyes lit up. She seemed to have thought of something. She wanted to speak, but she pressed down the urge again.

“Ling Han, you’re too arrogant!” Hu Sihai jumped out. He looked at Ling Han balefully, his killing intent surging.

An Inscription Tier elite.

“What do you have to bet with me?” Ling Han asked calmly.

Hu Sihai snorted and said, “I have a piece of precious iron here that can be used to forge high-grade weapons!”

He took out a piece of jade-green metal that was only the size of a fist.

Sixth Baby jumped onto Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “Father, this is Green Algae Gold. Although it can’t be considered precious metal, below the path of immortality, it can barely be considered just passable..”
