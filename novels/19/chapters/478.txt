Chapter 479: Two Great Spirits of the Five Elements

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

This was a set of divine bones. Although countless years passed, its divine nature still remained.

Moreover, they definitely weren’t the remains of a normal human.

There was a horn on the forehead! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was very obvious that the horn was broken, leaving only a small half on its forehead. Moreover, legs and arms had winged bones, which were also broken. It could be imagined that when this god was alive, its arms and legs had extremely sharp blade-like bones that protruded.

‘This isn’t a human, but could it be a beast’s human transformation?’ Ling Han’s heart palpitated. He had read in ancient records that when beasts advanced into God Tier, they could exuviate their beast body and change into human form.

Some humans possessed the bloodlines of great ancient beasts—like Feng Yan—so it was very possible that it was after a beast became a god and transformed, having offspring with a human, which resulted in a trace of a beast’s bloodline to be inherited.

No matter what, these were precious bones!

Without another word, Ling Han was going to store the remains into the Black Tower, but he immediately discovered that his idea couldn’t be carried out.

What happened—could God Tier items not be stored inside the Black Tower?

No.

He immediately discovered a blood-sucking bug the size of a fist flying out from within the remains. It stared at him and emitted a shocking chill.

A Flower Blossom Tier existence!

Hiss!

Ling Han suddenly understood—could these blood-sucking bugs be born from the god’s corpse? That was why it could be unafraid of a god’s oppressiveness after death, and not worry about dying from having no food to eat. They normally resided inside the god’s remains, absorbing the god’s presence.

Damn it—what the hell was this place exactly, was it using a god as sacrifice?

“Mother!” Yue Kai Yu screamed in fright. They were giving it all to block the blood-sucking bugs from the outside and could barely defend relying on the narrow passageway; however, Ling Han attracted another bug king, one that was at the Flower Blossom Tier.

“Don’t be nervous. You guys keep dealing with the small ones, leave the big one up to me,” Ling Han said smilingly as he waved his right hand, summoning the rock spirit. At this moment, rock spirit had already completely recovered.

The earth was solid, and the rock spirit it birthed also inherited this strong point. Its defensive power was shocking, and its recovery power was also shocking. As long as it wasn’t annihilated on the spot, it would soon recover to as it usually was.

“Ang!” Once the rock spirit appeared, it roared at the bug king, the sound waves like blades.

The bug king was small, but its Flower Blossom Tier strength was bare to see. It wasn’t afraid at all and fluttered its wings. Weng, weng, weng, it swept up a whirlwind that greeted the sound waves. Pu, pu, pu, pu, the whirlwind and the sound waves collided, raising a shock wave.

The rock spirit’s sound wave clearly had the advantage; although it was weakened a bit, it still shattered the two whirlwinds, continuing to fire at the bug king.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. The rock spirit wasn’t a beast, but a miraculous being birthed by heaven and earth. In terms of ranking, it was not only a king amongst beasts, but even a king amongst kings.

Similar to how one who cultivated seven flashes of Sword Qi could be called a king amongst sword users, and those who cultivated ten flashes were also kings, but could the two types of kings be the same?

The bug king flapped its wings as it charged at the rock spirit, extremely fast, obviously trying to take advantage of the rock spirit’s sluggishness.

The rock spirit’s movements certainly weren’t as fast as the bug king’s. Only when the bug king stung its mouthpart at its heart did it finally swat over.

The bug king already started to suck blood. As long as it drained its opponent’s blood dry, no matter how strong, the opponent would simply turn into a corpse. However, only when it sucked did it discover... damn it, where was the blood?

Peng!

The rock spirit’s palm already hit. Its speed wasn’t ridiculously fast, but when the attack was fired, coming to the peak of its speed, it was also ridiculously fast.

This was about the same as hitting a fly. The rock spirit loosened its hand and the bug king instantly fell down, but then it flew up again after falling halfway down. It stared at the rock spirit with hatred and confusion.

‘Can’t suck blood—could this already be a corpse? But how can a corpse be so alive and kicking?’

Limited by the growth environment, even if the bug king already advanced into the Flower Blossom Tier, its experiences and its intelligence were quite limited, so it was confused all of a sudden.

It was confused, but the rock spirit wasn’t, roaring loudly as thirty-six “hairs” grew on top of its head. Zi , the power of heaven and earth was drawn, and instantly, a dazzling white lightning fired out along with its fist.

Tiandu Thunder Star Array!

Unfortunately, this was only a fifth-tier formation, and its effects weren’t optimal against a Flower Blossom Tier bug king, but against normal small blood-sucking bugs, the destructive power was too great.

“All come here!” Ling Han yelled. Yue Kai Yu, and Guang Yuan hurriedly ran over; but when large amounts of blood-sucking bugs surged in, they suffered the bombardment of the power of lightning, being instantly electrified to ashes.

This was produced by a formation and relied on the power of heaven and earth, having no need at all for rock spirit to initiate it. The rock spirit only needed to control the lightning so that it didn’t strike the three of them.

“Zhi! Zhi!” The bug king was furious, sending out an ear-piercing screech. Immediately, countless blood-sucking bugs gathered around the bug king as their center, turning into a black-colored tornado.

It was gathering the power of the swarm, assembling parts into a whole. With it as the core, adjusting from the center, it fired out the swarm’s power as one.

However, a problem immediately appeared. The black temple was only three meters high, and for the rock spirit which was ten times shorter, this height was just enough to display its abilities, but for the swarm, it was too narrow.

The rock spirit took the chance to attack. The power of lightning erupted and had a powerful restraining effect against evil things. The “tornado” kept being weakened, while the power in the rock spirit’s punch was unaffected at all, continuing to fire at the bug king that was at the core.

Peng , a fist shot out and the entire swarm of bugs immediately dispersed. The bug king flew out and emitted strange squeaks, appearing extremely furious.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Small Fire, come out to help.”

Hong , a flame flew out and turned into appearance of a small dog, circling Ling Han’s legs.

The corner of Ling Han’s mouth twitched involuntarily. He summoned Strange Fire to help fight alongside the rock spirit, not to let this guy mimic a dog and act cute.

“Go!” He threw a kick and the small dog that Strange Fire turned into was kicked towards the swarm.

A large swarm of blood-sucking bugs truly thought Strange Fire was food, so they dove at it one after another, but Strange Fire also cast off its “cute” mask, turning into a terrifying apocalyptic being.

Hong , the flame swirled pass, and instantly a large swarm of bugs was burnt into ashes.

The Strange Fire currently could even help Ling Han refine Heaven Grade medicinal pills, at least comparable to a Flower Blossom Tier, and Strange Fire was a natural nemesis for the swarm of bugs. With Small Fire’s eruption, the entire swarm of bugs hurriedly stayed far away from Small Fire as if they’d encountered their natural enemy; even the bug king revealed a look of fear.

All things had natural nemesis, and Strange Fire was definitely the natural enemy of the blood-sucking bugs; if the bug king wanted to fight against Small Fire, then it had to be at least five to six small tiers higher.

Besides, there was still another spirit of the five elements!
