Chapter 2411: Sprinting wildly on the Celestial Path

A great many people had not even managed to see Ling Han. They only managed to glimpse a figure blazing past them like lightning.

Because Ling Han was too fast, he caused a powerful gust of wind. In fact, a great many people were thrown off the rainbow bridge by the force of the wind. Upon closer look, one would discover that these people were all those that had spoken badly of Ling Han before.

…Who said that Ling Han was not the type to hold a grudge?

Not bothering to pay them any attention did not mean that he had forgotten. Since he had run past them, he would put slightly more effort into it while he was at it. Sending these people off the bridge as a small punishment naturally was just a very slight effort for him.

If this was flat land, to create a gust of wind from sprinting to send these consummate level Ascending Origin Tier elites tumbling was absolutely impossible, unless Ling Han made a deliberate move.

But this place was different. The rainbow bridge was incredibly slippery. Everyone had to walk carefully on it, so how could they bear up against this external force?

All of a sudden, it was like a celestial maiden scattering flowers as countless people fell down from the skies. That scene was quite grand and magnificent.

“Who is this? He’s a bit too powerful, isn’t he?”

“Others can only walk cautiously, yet he can sprint at full speed. This overwhelming strength is completely unfair!”

“Hiss, why do I feel that his rear view is a little familiar?”

“Ling Han! He’s Ling Han!”

There will always be those with sharp eyes, and they recognized Ling Han. With this call, everyone was dumbfounded.

The one that was sprinting madly on the rainbow bridge was actually Ling Han?

Heavens, previously everyone had still been laughing at him. Alchemists were only alchemists, after all. But now? There was no one with that kind of freakish talent. Even added together, would all of them be able to compare to him?

“Have you guys noticed? Those that have been blown off the Celestial Path were those people that laughed at him before?” someone asked slowly.

With this reminder, everyone’s expressions instantly changed.

“Now that you’re saying it, it seems like that really is the case!”

“The more you think about it, the scarier it is. His sprint is actually targeting them, showing that even now, his grasp of power is still proficient and smooth.”

“I am about to lose my mind. How could such a freak exist?”

“That’s right. In alchemy, he’s king, and now in cultivation, he’s also leaving us all behind in his dust. No one can be his equal, and he is peerless in this world!”

Everyone exclaimed in shock. Comparing yourself to him would truly drive you crazy. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ling Han released a battle cry. His speed became faster and faster. It was like what lay beneath his feet was not a path of trial formed from Regulations, but rather a wide path that could not be more ordinary.

One after another, he sprinted past everyone. In the first place, the Eastern Celestial Realm did not have many emperor tiers, and now that they had all been enrolled into the Saintly Origin Academy, or had gone to the Western Celestial Realm as summoned by the Heavenly Venerates, while those that stayed could not be considered the bottom of the barrel, there were indeed not even many emperor tiers among them.

When Ling Han had passed a certain emperor tier, there was already no one ahead of him. The Empress and the others’ lead was extraordinarily huge.

And when they saw Ling Han sprint past him, that emperor tier almost fell off the rainbow bridge in his shock.

Gods, he’d seen a ghost!

Ling Han ran for a considerably long time again, right until he was drawing close to the end of the rainbow bridge. Only then did he finally see the Empress and the others.

The Empress and Hu Niu were both progressing smoothly, but Bewitching Maiden Rou was doing considerably worse. Her forehead was covered with sweat. After all, she was only a monarch tier, unlike Hu Niu and the Empress, who were both Monarch Stars.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu was the first to discover Ling Han, and immediately waved at him. She was in the lead, and behind her was Bewitching Maiden Rou. With such a sudden stop, Bewitching Maiden Rou almost collided with her. This witch continuously patted her bountiful bosom at the near miss, causing it to wave alluringly. Who knew if she was doing it on purpose.

Ling Han caught up, and grinned. “Thankfully, I’ve caught up.”

The three women had not reached the end of the rainbow bridge yet. He had not broken his promise.

They walked a few more steps, and the rainbow bridge reached its end. The end of the rainbow bridge was actually connected to a steep cliff.

This cliff was very strange. It was illusory, and whichever angle one looked at it from, it seemed to be nonexistent. It could only be seen when one was standing on the rainbow bridge, and could only be set foot on from there as well.

The power of heaven and earth was not something that could be humanly studied.

They all stepped onto the cliff, and the steady and real feeling of gravity returned to them. They felt a profound ease at this. Otherwise, it would feel like they were hanging in midair.

“This first step tests one’s agreement with Dao,” Ling Han said, turning his head.

The Empress nodded. “If understanding of great dao is still not thorough enough, there would be no way to pass through here at all.”

This first test would eliminate half the candidates, and also gave a resounding blow to many rookies who had come for the first time. Becoming a Celestial King was not as simple as they had imagined.

“We still have 10,000 years’ time.”

Once the Celestial Path was open, or rather after this Mystery Realm had begun, there was 10,000 years’ time for them to roam around here, and search for the true Celestial Path. Furthermore, after 10,000 years, the Celestial Path would close, and reopen only after another 10 billion years.

If they could not manage to leave in time, they wouldn’t die, of course. However, this was extremely close to the core of this heaven and earth. There was a mysterious power here. As long as one stayed here for more than 10,000 years, they would be bound by this power, and would never be able to leave again.

“There are only two ways if you want to leave this place.

“First, go back on the path that you have come. Second, head to the center of this Mystery Realm. There is something similar to a Transfer Formation there, but only a Celestial King would be able to activate it.

“In other words, if you can’t become a Celestial King, you can only go back the path that you have come.

“But if you penetrate too deep, or lose your way, the moment the deadline of 10,000 years has passed, you would be eternally trapped here.

“Since the ancient times, countless people have been trapped here, and as they grew older and had children, this Mystery Realm has become more and more populated.

“Additionally, though they would be eternally trapped here, they could also let go of all other worries. They would have boundless time to attempt becoming a Celestial King. Hence, there would be Celestial Kings here, and their number would not be too few, either.”

Ling Han and the others were all thinking back on the information about the Celestial Path. This was something that they had to know.

“I am truly quite curious. Yan Xianlu was born on the Celestial Path. Could it be that there were two Ascending Origin Tiers that fell in love with each other here, and couldn’t stop themselves from being caught in their passion?” Ling Han had a strange expression on his face. He truly wanted to see just who these two were.

Bewitching Maiden Rou could only shake her head. Why was this guy’s thought process always so strange?

They dared not be careless. At first, they thought that they could walk unrestrainedly on the Celestial Path, but since this place had Celestial King Tier beings, they had to be careful.

Moreover, having become a Celestial King here, they were still unable to leave. Perhaps, their personality would also have become warped. They had better not encounter this kind of maniac that would trap them here and prevent them from leaving. That would really be a great loss for them.

“Haha, you’ve lost.” Amidst a loud bout of laughter, two people were seen walking towards them. One was tall, and the other was short. They were both men, and presently, it was the shorter man that was speaking to the taller man.

Meanwhile, the taller man glared at Ling Han and his group, baffling Ling Han and the others. ‘What did we do to you? Why are you looking at us so viciously?’

The shorter man snickered. “I made a bet with him that after the Celestial Path opens this time round, the fastest person would walk over the rainbow bridge within three days. I bet on yes, and he bet on no. Hence, now that we’ve seen you here, it naturally proves that I’ve won.”

The taller man revealed a blazing killing intent. “As long as I kill them, there wouldn’t be any, right?”

“You can’t be that kind of sore loser!” the shorter man hurriedly exclaimed.

Yet Ling Han chuckled. “How overbearing. Wanting to kill just for something like that?

“Can’t I?” The tall man scoffed. “There is no way your Celestial King Tier elites can come in here, but we have Celestial Kings on guard here. Thus… it would be best for you to submit obediently!”
