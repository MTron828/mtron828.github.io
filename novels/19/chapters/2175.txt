Chapter 2176: Lady Wenren?

Ling Han was confused at first, but he quickly came to a realization.

After unleashing the power of darkness, Sui Yuanliang had already become the enemy of this heaven and earth. Meanwhile, the Celestial King Tier power had represented this heaven and earth, so after being activated, whom would it attack?

In other words, Sui Yuanliang had been seeking death.

“You’ve inflicted this fate upon yourselves!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. He hadn’t imagined that Sui Yuanliang would actually die by his own hands. Even he felt slightly dissatisfied by this conclusion.

He lashed out without mercy, killing all of the remaining disciples from the Dragon Universe Palace.

“Father!” Ling Jianxue called. He was slightly dazed as he gazed at his father, and his colorful imaginations of Ling Han naturally crumbled into ashes. Right now, he had to accept this mighty and powerful father.

Ling Han dashed over, pulling his son into a tight embrace.

Ling Jianxue was slightly flustered. He had never been embraced by a man before, especially a man he had just met. However, after a short while, he immediately felt the deep emotions of Ling Han’s embrace. Tears involuntarily welled up in his eyes.

“Father!” he called again. His voice was filled with emotion and admiration.

Ever since he could remember things, he had never met Ling Han. His only impression of Ling Han was created through the descriptions given by Helian Xunxue. He had once grumbled, he had once been confused, and he had once felt aggrieved. However, after beginning to cultivate, he had buried all of these emotions deep in his heart.

At this moment, a feeling of familial affection finally erupted without restraint.

Ling Han lightly patted Ling Jianxue’s back. At the same time, he channeled the Source Power of Wood, helping his son expel the poison from his body.

This was naturally an easy task.

Ling Jianxue had only been wounded by a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator, so his wounds naturally wouldn’t pose much challenge to Ling Han. Moreover, Ling Han could utilize his Source Powers of heaven and earth, so it wasn’t long before he expelled all of the poison from his son’s body, and healed all of his wounds.

However, Ling Jianxue had suffered severe wounds, after all, so he wouldn’t be able to fully recover in such a short period of time.

“Let’s go to my place first,” Wenren Yue said, interrupting at just the right moment.

His suggestion naturally won everyone’s approval. They all returned to the Wenren Clan. As for Wenren Tang… no one paid any heed to him. They didn’t even spare him as much as a glance.

How could Ling Han, the Empress, and the others pay any heed to such a measly person? Meanwhile, Wenren Yue felt it beneath him to deal with such matters. He had made the right move and taken the right gamble, and this had allowed him to instantly turn the tables.

After arriving at the Wenren Clan, Wenren Yue arranged their living quarters. Meanwhile, the disciples of the Dragon Universe Palace were all captured by Ling Han. With him using his divine sense to observe the surroundings, these people were naturally unable to flee.

Those who deserved death were killed, and those who deserved punishment had their cultivation crippled. Ling Han wasn’t a bloodthirsty person. He understood how to act with reason.

With their support, Wenren Chuang naturally inherited the position of clan leader without any problem. In fact, Ling Han even gifted him several alchemical pills, helping him directly reach the Genesis Tier.

However, this also came with a side effect. That was, Wenren Chuang was now stripped of any chance of improvement. He could only stay at the Genesis Tier forever.

To Wenren Chuang, however, this was already good enough. This was because with his cultivation talent, it had almost been impossible for him to reach the Genesis Tier in the first place.

Wenren Yue was extremely intelligent, and he immediately organized an inheritance ceremony for his younger brother. At the same time, he invited Ling Han and the others to attend this ceremony. He believed that after doing this, the nearby forces most likely wouldn’t dare to target the Wenren Clan in the future.

Because he was afraid of the Four Seas Palace, Ling Han put on some disguise. Otherwise, when he arrived at the Heavenly Saint Palace, perhaps the people from the Four Seas Palace would already be waiting for him there.

“Huh? Where’s Wenren Yue?” The ceremony was about to begin, yet Wenren Yue surprisingly had yet to arrive. Ling Jianxue couldn’t help but find this strange.

A mysterious smile spread across Wenren Chuang’s face, and he said, “Brother Jianxue, you’ll find out soon.”

“How mysterious. What in the world are you playing at?” Ling Jianxue murmured. He had been recuperating in the Black Tower for the past few days, which was equivalent to thousands of years in the Black Tower. Thus, he had naturally made a full recovery already.

He had severed heaven and earth when advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier, yet he had also ground to a halt after reaching the Fourth Severance. With Ling Han’s abundant amount of cultivation resources, he now had hopes of reaching the Fifth Severance.

At this moment, a beautiful woman walked over, and stopped behind Ling Jianxue.

Ling Jianxue didn’t pay any attention at first, yet the woman surprisingly didn’t leave after stopping behind him. He found this especially strange, and he couldn’t help but turn around, and ask, “Miss, why are you standing behind me?”

The woman clasped her hands behind her back with a smile, and said, “Brother Jianxue, is this your attitude toward someone who shared adversity with you?”

‘Huh? This voice is so familiar!’

Ling Jianxue was slightly dazed as he stared at her. After a moment, he suddenly exclaimed, “Y-you’re Wenren Yue!”

“It’s Wenren Yue, not Wenren Yue[1],” the woman said with a smile. “In the past, my brother was too young, and was unable to deal with clan matters, so the elders in the clan disguised me as a male so that I could support the hope of the main branch of the clan. After so long, I’ve almost forgotten that I’m a female as well.”

Ling Jianxue couldn’t help but feel respect. For the sake of her brother and clan, this woman had made such a huge sacrifice. She was deserving of his respect.

“Lady Wenren, I’m impressed,” he said with sincerity.

Wenren Yue smiled, and said, “Call me by my name. I can also call you by your name, right?”

“Indeed,” Ling Jianxue replied. He didn’t think much about this.

Not far away, Ling Han and Helian Xunxue were far more understanding of this exchange.

“This girl has feelings for Jianxue,” Helian Xunxue said with a slightly proud expression. Her son was well received by women, so she was naturally overjoyed as well.

“But doesn’t Jianxue like Shuangshuang? Now that another person has suddenly appeared, will it cause trouble?” Zhu Xuan’er asked. They had all heard Ling Han talking about how Ling Jianxue was head over heels for Chen Shuangshuang.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before smilingly saying, “It’s no problem. Let the two of them grow closer, and this will also stimulate that girl. She’s always so airheaded, so isn’t she delaying the fourth generation of the Ling Clan?”

However, the Empress, Li Sichan, and the others didn’t think that the airheaded Chen Shuangshuang would understand the situation. After all, hadn’t the granddaughter of Celestial King Jiuhua pursued Ling Jianxue before as well? Why hadn’t that girl shown any signs of jealousy?

Perhaps she hadn’t been stimulated enough?

Ling Han pondered this. However, he didn’t want to expose this in a forthright manner. Instead, he wanted Chen Shuangshuang to discover this by herself.

After Wenren Chuang became the clan leader, many people came to offer their congratulations. They all heard that the Dragon Universe Palace had been destroyed, and they naturally attributed this to elites from the Heavenly Saint Palace. Thus, they naturally didn’t dare to underestimate the Wenren Clan.

This allowed the Wenren Clan to feel extremely proud from top to bottom. Their new clan leader had only just ascended this position, and there were already so many powerful clans coming over to congratulate them. In the future, their development would naturally be smooth as well. Prosperity was just around the corner.

After dealing with all the other matters, Ling Han waved his hand, and set off with everyone else for the Heavenly Saint Palace. Wenren Yue naturally set off with them as well. She had made a promise with Ling Jianxue, so she would also join the Heavenly Saint Palace, and become an external disciple.

“Father, this is the Cold Moon Light Sun Sword,” Ling Jianxue said as he retrieved a sword, handing it over to Ling Han.

Ling Han accepted it, and held the sword hilt in his right hand. Meanwhile, he used his left hand to lightly stroke the blade of the sword. He was slightly curious. This was a sword that Sui Yuanliang had been intent on obtaining, even if that meant offending the Heavenly Saint Palace. Just what was so special about it?

Weng!

His hand stroked the blade, causing it to lightly shudder. It was as if the sword were murmuring.

“This sword is extraordinary. However, perhaps only Sui Yuanliang knew its history,” Ling Han said. He retrieved Sui Yuanliang’s Spatial God Tool, saying, “Let’s look through his belongings. Perhaps we can find some information.”
