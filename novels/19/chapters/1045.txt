Chapter 1046: Poor Again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han temporarily laid aside his displeasing troubles, and moved to handle a more pressing issue.

He wanted to sell off a large amount of Heavenly Pearl Pills.

He would naturally have to seek out Li Weiwei for this. If he was to take them to be sold, the price would definitely be horribly lowered; who asked him to have neither the right social connections nor the background? But with Li Weiwei on the forefront, who would dare trick the daughter of the Left Minister?

Even if he shared some of the profits with Li Weiwei, it was still profitable for him.

Li Weiwei had already experienced the sweet taste of earning money, and naturally seized this job with pleasure. However, when she saw the number of Heavenly Pearl Pills, she couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. “What alchemy clan have you robbed?”

There was really too many of them. An ordinary pharmacy might not even have one-hundredth of this amount.

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “I’ll take 80%, and you will have 20%. All right?”

Li Weiwei nodded happily. She was merely doing an errand, and the price of alchemical pills was far higher than food ingredients’; even if it was a mere 20%, she would be earning an exorbitant amount.

Ling Han met with Lin You, Ma Xing, and the others again. They were still in the Shattering Void Tier Division, and would definitely not attempt to break through to the Immortal level without pushing their battle prowess up to 20 Stars of the Shattering Void Tier. They all felt rueful. They had entered the Scarlet Heaven Academy together, and they were all practically making no headway, whereas Ling Han was already in the medium extreme of Mountain River Tier.

Why was the gap between them so overwhelmingly massive?

Li Weiwei was very efficient. For the sake of money, this young mistress had really worked hard. In a short three days, she had already earned 3,000,000 True Origin Stones for Ling Han. Even if the profits were shared at an 80-20 ratio between them, the wealth that reached Ling Han’s hands was still more than 2,000,000.

He only retained a bit of True Origin Stones for cultivation and maintaining the puppets. He traded the others for raw materials to be used to concoct the Jade Heaven Pill.

A medium extreme cultivator concocting a Level Three Divine Pill was a rather straining task. However, Ling Han had the Black Tower, so there was absolutely no need for him to worry about the heat of the flames. Furthermore, his divine sense was strong, and much sturdier than any ordinary medium extreme cultivator’s. Hence, he was completely capable of concocting a Level Three Divine Pill.

At the beginning, it was naturally a complete failure.

In just over a month’s time, he had already spent about 90% of the materials that had cost over 2,000,000. However, Ling Han finally saw the light of hope, and managed to get some idea of an outline from his many failures.

... Er, after failing for a few hundred to a thousand more times, he should be just about succeeding.

Just look at how he was burning through his cash.

Even Ling Han felt a little heartache because it was absolutely not enough to invest just 2,000,000. He needed another big sum—more or less the same amount.

“I’m lacking money!” Ling Han scratched his head. He had obviously just earned more than 2,000,000 not too long ago, so how had he become a pauper in just an instant? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Was there any spendthrift fool for him to trick?

“Young Master!” In front of Zhao Lun, an extremely beautiful woman was kneeling. Upon a closer look, she actually looked quite similar to Shui Yanyu. They were both captivatingly beautiful and similarly graceful. However, there was still a little bit of a gap, and she was lacking just that something.

Zhao Lun was presently looking at the ripples of the lake’s waters, his arms crossed behind him. They danced like thousands of golden snakes. Upon a closer look, his fingers were also moving at a certain rhythm.

He had cultivated a special ancient technique, and had to learn from observing the movement of the water to comprehend the rhythm of the heaven and earth.

“What is it?” he asked calmly, his tone even. From his expression, he seemed to have completely walked out of the shadow of being defeated at Ling Han’s hands.

“Ling Han and Miss Shui have returned,” the beautiful woman said. Her name was Yang Luodan.

That calm expression on Zhao Lun’s face suddenly twisted, his right hand involuntarily clenching into a fist. Losing to Ling Han—even if it was because his cultivation level had been restricted—was still the greatest stain in his entire life.

What more when Ling Han was still walking around with Shui Yanyu everywhere, and this was his reverse scale 1 .

“Those two pieces of trash, they can’t even accomplish such a little matter!!” Zhao Lun humphed. Now, both Ling Han and Shui Yanyu had returned, whereas Zuo Xiao and Fan Yong had disappeared. Obviously, not only had they not succeeded, they had also been killed by Ling Han.

... Though the truth of the matter was a little different, it was true that these two people had indeed failed and died.

Zhao Lun could not understand. Those two were at the peak stage of the high extreme, their battle prowess could exceed two to three stars, and they had even been given two treasures. And even then, they could not kill Ling Han?

Was it that the ant from the small world had come by opening the sky, really obtaining the instillation of fortune from the heaven and earth, and thus could not be killed?

“Could it be that I have to do it myself?” he uttered ruthlessly. A red sun appeared behind him. Though it was very small, but compared to Mountain River Tier, it was a qualitative change.

That ant from the small world was presently a man of the Ninth King. How many would dare to oppose Ling Han on the surface? Were they not afraid to provoke the anger of the Ninth King? Then, putting aside Zhao Lun, even if Great General Zhao stepped out, it was useless.

“Young Master, why don’t we ask someone from the Dark Night Hall?” Yang Luodan suggested.

Zhao Lun’s expression clenched involuntarily. He humphed, and exclaimed, “How dare you!!”

The Dark Night Hall was the public enemy of the three great Majestic Empires. Zhao Lun himself was the son of the Great General. If it was known that he had any dealings with the Dark Night Hall, wouldn’t he attract the attention of the empress? Then, if she conducted an investigation, there was a possibility that he might even be executed.

If he committed a crime when he well knew the law, his crime would be even heavier!

Yang Luodan hurriedly knelt, and uttered, “Please quell your anger, Young Master!”

At first, Zhao Lun was planning to rebuke her some more, but when he saw Yang Luodan kneeling on the ground, her rounded hips sticking up proudly, he couldn’t help but feel his ***** stir.

Before entering into Sun Moon Tier, the Great General Zhao would not allow him to approach any women, fearing that he would be drunk in sexual pleasures and thus hold up his cultivation. However, this ban had already disappeared by now. Zhao Lun did not favor any ordinary beauties, and had only Shui Yanyu in his heart.

However, Shui Yanyu was showing determination that she would prefer to marry a pig, or a dog, anyone but him. This made him very furious, and that was why he deliberately sought out Yang Luodan to be his follower, inevitably with the purpose to treat her like a substitute for Shui Yanyu.

However, Yang Luodan was still not Shui Yanyu, after all. Moreover, he had had no such interest all this while—right until this moment, when he was provoked by the news about Ling Han. His self-discipline had also fallen to rock bottom.

He suddenly pounced over, and impatiently tore off her clothing.

“Young Master, what are you doing?!” Yang Luodan exclaimed in shock, but there was a hint of pleasure in the depths of her eyes. She was not just satisfied with being Zhao Lun’s follower. Her ambition was greater than that; she wanted to become the young mistress of the General’s Residence!

Sticking out his waist, Zhao Lun had entered into Yang Luodan, and began to madly thrust into her.

Yang Luodan wrapped her arms around Zhao Lun, a hint of a smile around the corners of her lips. The first step of her plan had already succeeded.

“Young Master, what do you think about my idea? We can conceal our identities; in any case, the Dark Night Hall only recognizes money and not people!” she continued while panting. Merely satisfying Zhao Lun’s ****** was useless—he would only treat her like a tool for him to release his frustrations.

How could Zhao Lun have his usual judgement in this kind of situation? He nodded his head absent-mindedly, and replied, “You will be in charge of this matter!” After he said this, he greedily sucked Yang Luodan’s breasts, imagining her to be Shui Yanyu, and couldn’t help but be even more excited than before.

Ling Han had already expended all the materials, and was still unable to concoct the Jade Heaven Pill. Now that his pocket was empty, he could only concoct some more Heavenly Pearl Pills to earn money in order to fund alchemy with alchemy.

Time passed very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, five months had passed.

For cultivators, five months was really just a blink of an eye. There was not much difference between five months for cultivators and the passing of a few days for ordinary people.

But for Ling Han, one month’s time was enough for him to experience a massive change.

The Jade Heaven Pill was finally concocted, and he, too, had stepped into the late stage of the medium extreme.
