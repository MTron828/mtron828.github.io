Chapter 1137: Goddess Furnace

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She was a super genius who was no weaker than Shao Sisi and Xia Wuque—her power had already reached six stars.

She was at the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier, and her power was six stars above this level. Just how terrifying was this?

Swoosh!

The winds and clouds swirled under the effects of the whip, and it was as if a gaping hole were going to be torn in the sky!

She was different, very different!

Although Fu Liangye was also a seed-level genius, his cultivation level was still too low at the moment. Thus, he was nowhere near the level of Gan Shiyun.

Ling Han knew that the him from two years ago would only be able to withstand the power of this whip with his physique. Now, however...

He casually raised his hand and brought two of his fingers together. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Pa!

The whip was easily caught between his two fingers.

Pu!

Countless people almost spat their tongues out in shock upon seeing this.

Gan Shiyun was a seed-level genius of the Majestic Heaven Sect! Moreover, she was also at the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier. Theoretically speaking, she should have been invincible in the Mountain River Tier—at the very least, no one should have been able to suppress her.

However, this youth had casually caught her whip, and his expression was as if he still had a lot of strength to spare. How large was the gap between them?

Gan Shiyun’s eyes also bulged in shock. A frosty chill gripped at her heart, and she thought, ‘How can this youth be so powerful? He didn’t use any secret techniques, and he relied solely on his power to catch my whip!’

This signified that his power was far above hers. Moreover, his physique was also freakishly sturdy. Otherwise, one would definitely get injured after catching a God Tool like that—regardless of how strong their power was.

However, could such a person really exist in this world?

If they did, shouldn’t they be a seed of the Majestic Heaven Sect?

Ling Han let go of the whip, and said, “One shouldn’t be too domineering. Being kind to others is also equivalent to leaving a path of retreat for oneself.” He turned toward Hu Feiyun with a smile, and said, “Ninth King, there’s a letter for you.”

Hu Feiyun seemed a little dazed as she accepted the letter from him. She speedily read through it, and then asked in confusion, “Big Sister sent you over to become my follower?”

“That’s right,” Ling Han said with a nod.

‘What!?’

The people nearby were all stunned upon hearing their exchange.

This person—who could casually catch Gan Shiyun’s whip strike with two fingers—was actually going to become Hu Feiyun’s follower?

Although the people here all wished to become followers of the seeds, this was largely because they weren’t talented enough to become disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect. Otherwise, how many people would be willing to become servants?

However, judging by Ling Han’s abilities, he could have definitely qualified as a seed-level disciple. So, why was coming here to become a follower?

Even if he had missed the Majestic Heaven Sect’s recruitment period, couldn’t he just wait for the next recruitment period? It was only 100 years away—an insignificant amount of time to Immortals.

The onlookers couldn’t understand his actions. Then, they all looked toward Hu Feiyun in envy. Now that she had obtained such a powerful follower, her position in the sect would definitely rise to an even greater level.

“Who... are you?” Hu Feiyun was still as ditzy as always.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Han Lin.”

“Han Lin, Han Lin... Ling Han!” Hu Feiyun’s eyes suddenly lit up, the air of ditziness completely leaving her. A smile blossomed on her face. Her appearance was still a bit ditzy, though, and this filled her smile with the innocence and adorable nature of a young girl.

Ling Han smiled faintly. Although this woman was a bit ditzy, she wasn’t stupid at all. She had guessed his identity from his alias alone, and this was enough to show the quickness of her reactions.

“Detestable!” Gan Shiyun shouted in fury. Flames surged from her body and weaved into a dense field of divine patterns, making her appear like a Goddess of Flames.

Ling Han turned around, and chided, “Hasn’t anyone told you that it’s rude to interrupt the conversations of others?”

“That’s right!” Hu Feiyun concurred. Her personality hadn’t changed at all.

There was a look of rage on Gan Shiyun’s pretty face. These two people were working together to ridicule her! Disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect obviously weren’t allowed to kill each other, yet there was no such restriction for mere followers. Thus, no matter how talented he was, what did it matter if she killed him?

The dab of cinnabar between her brows flashed, and a furnace surprisingly flew out. Its emergence instantly caused the temperatures in the surrounding to soar.

“Crap! That’s the Gan Clan’s Goddess Furnace!”

“It’s a Heavenly Body Tier precious treasure, and it can incinerate all life!”

“No, this is only a replica. The real Goddess Furnace is definitely still at the Gan Clan.”

“That still doesn’t change the fact that it’s extremely powerful. In fact, it’s almost at the Sun Moon Tier!”

The surrounding onlookers frantically retreated. A seed at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier was unleashing her might, and even fellow seeds would have to draw on their full power if they were to battle against her. Thus, what right did they have to spectate the battle from a close distance?

Ling Han shuffled over to block Hu Feiyun behind him. Meanwhile, the Ninth King stuck her head over Ling Han’s shoulder in confusion, and said, “Why is she so angry?”

The people in the surroundings all wore strange expressions. ‘WIll Gan Shiyun vomit blood upon hearing this?’

Gan Shiyun didn’t vomit blood. However, her pretty face darkened considerably, and she instantly activated her Goddess Furnace.

Boom!

Countless bursts of flames soared into the air and intertwined to form sheets of dazzling divine patterns. This was a terrifying sight.

“Roaring Flames Incinerate the Heaven!” she roared. She smacked the Goddess Furnace, and the lid of the furnace instantly flew up, releasing a green flame that surged toward Ling Han.

Ling Han activated an Origin Power shield.

His physique was obviously powerful enough to resist these flames, yet his clothes would definitely be burned to ash. If he allowed these flames to hit him, he would definitely be “stripped” naked. He naturally couldn’t let this happen.

“I’ve got to buy some precious treasure clothes,” Ling Han mumbled to himself. “They don’t need to possess much defensive ability, but they definitely have to be resistant to fire and water.”

“Die!” Gan Shiyun controlled her Goddess Furnace and charged toward Ling Han. Since the surging flames couldn’t kill Ling Han, she would absorb him into the furnace and refine him using its divine flames. That ought to incinerate him into ashes, right?

Weng!

The Goddess Furnace expanded and bore down on Ling Han.

There was a deafening noise as the Goddess Furnace slammed into the ground. Meanwhile, Ling Han was nowhere to be seen.

He had been trapped inside the furnace!

“Hahahaha!” Gan Shiyun roared with laughter. Ling Han had been trapped inside the Goddess Furnace, so what use was it that he possessed an incredible power? Being incinerated into ashes was his only fate!

Peng!

A fist-shaped dent appeared on the lid of the furnace, causing the entire furnace to shudder.

Peng!

Immediately afterward, another fist-shaped dent appeared. Then a third, a fourth...

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The Goddess Furnace instantly lost its original shape, becoming extremely irregular in appearance.

Everyone’s mouth gaped open in shock. In fact, their jaws hung so low that even a fist could be stuffed into their mouths.

It was clear that Ling Han was unleashing his might.

Gan Shiyun had no option but to continue. “Refine him!” she shouted frantically.

She unleashed the full power of the God Tool and attempted to refine Ling Han using the supreme divine flames.

Even the seeds went pale upon witnessing this sight.

“What kind of freak is that person? He’s already been trapped inside the Goddess Furnace, yet he still hasn’t been refined yet. Not only that, but he’s even as energetic as can be! The Goddess Furnace has almost been destroyed by him!”

“Although this isn’t the real Goddess Furnace, it’s still an extremely terrifying Mountain River Tier God Tool.”

“This is... simply unbelievable!”
