Chapter 568: Thousand Corpse Sect’s Crushing Defeat

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

As the sword swept by, it was as if a true dragon had revived. The thick and long Sword Qi spread its claws, slashing towards the five Corpse Soldiers.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, the Sword Qi swept past, and the five corpses were sent flying all together as if they were five feathers too frail to stand a gust of wind, unable to stand even a single blow. After they landed, everyone saw clearly that there were actually spiderweb-like cracks on their bones.

Hiss!

Everyone gasped in astonishment. Corpse Soldiers had formidable physique, but under Ling Han’s sword attack, cracks actually appeared; wasn’t this too ridiculous?

The Sword Qi was only fired out with a sixth-tier Spirit Tool, and even if it were stronger than the Corpse Soldiers, it shouldn’t be powerful to such a degree!

“He, he condensed Sword Qi!” someone said in a quavering voice.

Not a Sword Ray, but condensed flashes of Sword Qi. Their power far surpassed average Sword Qi, but was inferior to Sword Ray’s. This was a stage where one could both retreat and advance, possessing might that surpassed Qi but was not constrained by a Ray; one could still continue to increase the amount of flashes of Qi.

A genius! A freak!

Simply looking at Xuanyuan Zi Guang operate it for a short while, he learned it already? My God, could there really be such a terrifying guy in the world?

However, they didn’t know that Ling Han had stood at the heights of the Heaven Tier, and in this lifetime, he’d even acquired a Mystical Power—the Eye of Truth, which could reach the essence of things, allowing him to clearly see how Xuanyuan Zi Guang combined and used Qi.

Once he had the inspiration, with his martial talent and the height he’d once stood at, combining Sword Qi became a piece of cake.

“Damn it!” Tian Xiu Ning roared angrily and unleashed from within his body waves of Corpse Qi, which surged into the five Corpse Soldiers. Instantly, the cracks on their bodies healed at an extremely fast rate.

This was the advantage of Corpse Soldiers; as long as there was an endless supply of Corpse Qi, they were almost undying. Else, why had Xuanyuan Zi Guang not won against Ju Tian Ge despite grasping the mystic arts of combining Qi, and having reached 22 flashes of Qi?

On one side, Ju Tian Ge was certainly very strong, and on the other, it was because of the undying characteristic of Corpse Soldiers.

“Kill!” Tian Xiu Ning controlled the Corpse Soldiers again to attack at Ling Han.

Ling Han, however, was unperturbed, and muttered, “Sword Qi combining has succeeded, but to adhere the bone patterns on it... is somewhat difficult.” He wanted to adhere the Old Vicious Mongoose’s bone patterns onto the Sword Qi; this could greatly increase the Qi flashes’s power.

However, now that the Sword Qi was an amalgam, adhering the bone patterns onto it was difficult!

Ling Han continued to use the five Corpse Soldiers as sparring partners, continuously striking out with Sword Qi. As the terrifying sword attacks swept past, the five Corpse Soldiers were injured repeatedly. Even if Desolate Hell Sword was mainly defensive, the combined Sword Qi’s power was too strong.

Tian Xiu Ning no longer had the energy to partake in the battle, simply unleashing Corpse Qi continuously to repair the Corpse Soldiers; otherwise, once these corpses were shattered, it would also mean his crushing defeat.

Although he was a highly ranked disciple in the Thousand Corpse Sect, Corpse Qi still had its limits, and he soon felt immense pressure.

After countless slashes, Ling Han struck again with the sword, yet discovered that there were no Corpse Soldiers that came to block the sword. He was startled; looking at Tian Xiu Ning, he said, “Why aren’t you fight... sh*t, why are you looking so ghastly, trying to scare people to death!”

Although Tian Xiu Ning was far from being handsome and bright, he was still tall and masculine, emitting an astounding presence all over his body... but now? He actually became emaciated, so much that his skin stuck onto his bones as if he’d starved for several months.

“You, you still want to humiliate me?!” Tian Xiu Ning said with a quavering voice; he continuously repaired the five Corpse Soldiers and had exhausted his Corpse Qi, even consuming quite a bit of Origin Source Corpse Qi, so he naturally shriveled up into a skeletal monster.

“Haha, didn’t notice, didn’t notice,” Ling Han said without any sincerity while revealing a regretful look. He still hadn’t adhered the bone patterns onto the combined Sword Qi—mainly because his opponent couldn’t take much of a beating.

Tian Xiu Ning mustered up some remaining strength and leapt back to his own side; this battle was obviously a crushing defeat.

“Next!” Ling Han said indifferently.

Bai Yuan stared at Ling Han, feeling a sense of speechlessness.

He’d known that there were hidden talents in the middle state and that the current prodigies were even more likely to appear at a place like Million Treasures City; thus, he’d brought ten of the sect master’s disciples to come here for a challenge, toughening these conceited youngsters.

However, he’d still been sure on the inside that with Ju Tian Ge present, opponents would be easily suppressed no matter how strong.

Now... Ju Tian Ge was obstructed, while the other disciples suffered crushing defeat! They didn’t lose to one person, but they collectively lost three times. First losing to a small little girl, then losing to a naturally foolish girl, and then to this young man.

What an unlucky year this was... there were too many prodigies.

“No need to fight, I’ll count it as you winning nine rounds. Wait till the third’s fight stops, then he’ll fight you,” Bai Yuan said grudgingly.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said to Xuanyuan Zi Guang, “Little Guang Guang, can you do it or not? If you can’t, leave it to me.”

“Bullsh!t!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang roared angrily as divine light flashed in his eyes, and purple-colored flames were emitted from his body. Hong , his aura actually skyrocketed.

“Power of bloodline?” Ling Han muttered. At this moment, Xuanyuan Zi Guang was truly powerful, and it felt like he’d already surpassed the level of the Flower Blossom Tier and crossed into the height of the Spiritual Infant Tier.

“Within three moves, I’ll crush you!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang shouted, firing both fists like hammers towards Ju Tian Ge.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, peng, peng! As expected, the five Corpse Soldiers weren’t Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s match at all, exploding into pieces with a casual strike and not even having the chance to be restored.

Ju Tian Ge’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly retreated toward the side of the Thousand Corpse Sect, no longer daring to fight.

This was natural. Spiritual Infant Tier elites suppressed Flower Blossom Tier ones, and he wasn’t strong to the point where he could crush a Spiritual Infant Tier while at a disadvantage, so he could only forfeit the battle.

Ju Tian Ge was also defeated.

At this point, the Thousand Corpse Sect’s ten disciples were all defeated, making them all lose face. They clearly came with the light of the victorious yet were trampled into dregs; no one could keep their heads up.

Bai Yuan sighed inwardly. The eldest and the second didn’t come, so it seemed like they could only swallow the defeat this time.

“Han Lin, dare to fight me?” Xuanyuan Zi Guang targeted Ling Han.

Ling Han’s gaze swept by as he said, “Want to fight? Then fight. Where do you come up with all this nonsense!”

“Hahahaha, though I really dislike you, I must admit, you certainly have quite the nerve!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang charged over, striking with his palms, and a massive fire tiger was formed. “I’ll let a thieving man like you know what true power is!”

After he activated the power of bloodline, his power skyrocketed, breaking through the level of the Flower Blossom Tier. Condensing 22 flashes of Qi again, the fire tiger could even annihilate low stage Spiritual Infant Tier opponents; it was terrifyingly powerful.

Ling Han obviously wouldn’t counter it head on. He was originally behind in cultivation by quite a lot, not to mention now that the power of bloodline was activated—it was like taking a forbidden medicine as Xuanyuan Zi Guang instantly became several times fiercer.

He displayed the Demon Fairy Step. Once he delayed to when the power of bloodline was exhausted, he would launch a counteroffensive.
