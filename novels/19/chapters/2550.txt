Chapter 2551: All Tricked

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Advance?

The Imperial Void Celestial King and the others had already entered, yet the group still couldn’t sense any commotion at all. According to what He Runhai had said, they should have encountered grave dangers if they entered. Even the Imperial Void Celestial King wouldn’t be exempt from this.

After all, this was the handiwork of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Even though he was already dead, his handiwork still remained heaven-defying.

That being the case, entering would equate to seeking death.

Perhaps they should retreat?

But was there still anywhere for them to retreat?

He Runhai had clearly prepared a trap. He had taken advantage of everyone to shatter the large formation, and it was now time for him to reap the rewards. Would he allow Ling Han and the others to leave?

It was only logical to assume that he had made other preparations to prevent them from leaving.

“Neither advancing nor retreating is a suitable choice. Why don’t we stay put and observe any changes instead? We’ll deal with any changes by remaining steadfast and calm!”

In the end, the four of them reached a consensus. They would stay put and observe any changes.

Wally released a green light wave that undulated into the surroundings. This light wave would instantly alert him to any changes.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the Empress had already retrieved their Celestial Tools. The large black dog also wore a solemn expression. They might encounter a fierce and brutal battle at any moment.

Clang, clang, clang!

The metal chains slithered around the sky, creating deafening noises. In fact, there were still more lengths of metal chains gathering from the surroundings, causing the metal tree to become larger and larger.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han and the others all looked up at the sky. Another person had been impaled by the metal chains and lifted up into the sky.

Ji Wuming! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He roared in rage, and the Celestial Tool in his hand ferociously slashed down. However, this was utterly futile. Peculiar symbols pulsated on the metal chains, forming a sheen of light every time the Divine Sword slashed down, and blocking its attacks.

This was similar to how Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could form a layer of Regulations around their fists, allowing them to face Celestial Tools head-on.

Ji Wuming unleashed his full might. The right side of his chest suddenly started to expand and pulsate, and it was clear that he surprisingly had another heart!

This heart provided him with a vast amount of Celestial King blood essence, causing his battle prowess to instantly soar several-fold.

The Sixth Heaven, Seventh Heaven, Eighth Heaven, Ninth Heaven!

It was as if Ji Wuming had returned to his previous life, becoming an invincible Ninth Heaven Celestial King. The might of his Celestial Tool was also completely unleashed, appearing as devastating as could be.

There was a crisp clanging sound as the sheen of light on the metal chain was shattered. Moreover, these metal chains weren’t forged from Divine Metal, so how could they possibly withstand the power of Celestial Tool? With just a few chops, the metal chain was ruthlessly hacked apart.

However, even more metal chains slithered over like snakes, firmly trapping Ji Wuming.

“As expected of the most powerful Celestial King of his time,” the large black dog said with sincerity. “If I hadn’t undergone a great rebirth, I definitely couldn’t have reached the same height as him.”

Ling Han furrowed his brows. Ji Wuming was still unable to break free, and this certainly wasn’t good news. “Now that Ji Wuming has reincarnated and recultivated, his achievements will still be above yours.”

“Utter bollocks! Grandpa Dog completed a great rebirth, something that even one in a gazillion Celestial Kings might not succeed in! It’s far superior to reincarnation!” the large black dog said with a sneer.

“Then why don’t you go over and help?” Ling Han said.

The large black dog immediately cowered, saying, “Heh, can’t you see that Grandpa Dog hasn’t cultivated to the pinnacle state yet? My battle prowess is still slightly inferior.”

Clang, clang, clang!

Another metal chain soared into the air, carrying with it a person.

This time, it was Huo Furong.

Even though she was revered as number one in the ages, with her Evolution Index reaching 12 and representing her future as a Heavenly Venerate, she was still only a Third Heaven Celestial King at this moment. At the most, her battle prowess could only reach the Sixth Heaven.

Even Ji Wuming, who possessed the power of his past life, had been trapped, so how could she possibly break free?

She roared with anger, and the ancient mirror above her head continued to fire beams of light. The Origin Flame of heaven and earth also raged, transforming into a flaming dragon. However, she was still unable to shatter the metal chains.

Immediately afterward, Xiao Yingxiong was also impaled. Then it was Liu Yufei, Gu Heyi, Miao Hua… Apart from the Imperial Void Celestial King, everyone who entered was impaled and trapped.

Of course, Ji Wuming had managed to temporarily break free, yet he was still engaged in a ferocious battle with the metal chains. It was hard to say whether he could successfully escape.

“Sh*tty dog, hurry up and help them!” Ling Han said as he kicked the large black dog.

“There’s no way that Grandpa Dog’s going over there!” the large black dog said as he shook his head. “This He Feng person is incredible! Even among Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, he was most likely still an elite among elites. This formation is far too terrifying. Each metal chain is as powerful as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and there’s more so a boundless number of them! If Grandpa Dog goes over, that will be nothing short of seeking death

“Forget about it, let’s flee while we can. If worse comes to worst, we’ll just burn some incense and paper money to commemorate them in the future.”

The large black dog prepared to flee.

Boom!

Right at this moment, there was a deafening sound as a figure suddenly charged over. A bell hovered above his head, continuing to ring even though no one struck it. Sound waves surged into the surroundings. Moreover, whenever these sound waves came into contact with the metal chains, it was as if they would lose their vitality, immediately dropping from the sky.

It was the Imperial Void Celestial King!

As expected of one of the most powerful Celestial Kings. The Imperial Void Celestial King was incredibly powerful, and he actually managed to break free from the shackles of the chains.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. He had already absorbed most of the essence of the Ancient Bell of Qian. Even Wally had said that the current Ancient Bell of Qian was only equivalent to five pieces of Divine Metal. Even so, the might of this Celestial Tool was still immense.

However, this was only natural. Any Celestial Tool that could reach the Ninth Heaven would be equivalent to an elite among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. With five fused together at one, it could naturally rival a monarch star.

However, even more powerful was the Imperial Void Celestial King himself. He swung his fists that were shrouded in Regulations, and even the powerful metal chains couldn’t contain him.

The metal tree shuddered slightly, emitting a crisp clinging sound of metal. Even more metal chains shot toward the Imperial Void Celestial King. 100, 1000, 10,000. Even the Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t withstand such a barrage. Just how many Celestial Kings did this equate to?

Elsewhere, Ji Wuming’s power had already receded from the Ninth Heaven. This had simply been a short burst of power, so how could he maintain it?

With his battle prowess declining, he was once again impaled and trapped by the metal chains.

“Aaah…!!!” The Imperial Void Celestial King roared in rage. Even though he was invincible among those at the same cultivation level, there were far too many metal chains at this moment. Each was equivalent to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so their sheer number had already surpassed his limit.

He was suppressed, and the area in which he could move continued to shrink.

“Hahahaha!” He Runhai’s laughter rumbled through the air. Everything was already settled.

He appeared before them again, standing atop the colossal tree of metal chains. His hands were clasped behind his back, and it was as if he were a mighty ruler of the world.

Indeed, everything was under his control at this moment. Even though Ling Han and the others were still uncaptured, this “metal tree” was far too devastating. It was hard to say how many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be needed to suppress this tree.

It was clear that the power of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates couldn’t be rivaled by that of Celestial Kings.

The title of Heavenly Venerate was transcendent above that of Celestial King.

“Master… forgive your disciple this one time!” Liu Yufei said in a feeble voice. She could feel her cultivation being mercilessly drained away by the metal chains. Before long, she would become a cripple.

“Detestable b*tch, you pretended to become my disciple, and you even tried to form a relationship with me on purpose. You think I didn’t know your true intentions? That you had your eyes set on the treasures of my ancestors?” He Runhai said in disdain. “I decided to play along with you. If you had been sincere, I would have shared some of the spoils with you. However, you simply wanted to take everything for yourself. That being the case, offer all of your blood essence to me!”

“No, your disciple is truly sincere!” Liu Yufei said.

“Since you’re sincere, then offer me your blood essence and help your master embark on this path of unrivaled greatness!” He Runhai said loudly. He then humphed, turning to the sky, and saying, “Lord Ancestor, does something feel amiss?”
