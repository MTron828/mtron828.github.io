Chapter 904: Descendant of the White Tiger

“Weiwei, what is it?” Ji Yun’er asked hurriedly. She would naturally not take Li Weiwei’s theory of the food being drugged seriously, but she was still worried when she saw Li Weiwei’s current expression.

This man from a small world might really not know respect and fear and do something shocking.

“It’s too delicious!” Li Weiwei suddenly exclaimed. Then she began wolfing down the food, and ate all the remaining barbequed meat. Then she turned to look fixedly at the plate in front of Ji Yun’er, her eyes bright as if she was about to pounce over any moment.

Ji Yun’er could not help but stretch out her arm to guard her food, and asked, “Is it really so delicious?”

Li Weiwei turned her face around, and demanded, “Blockhead, quickly serve the remaining barbequed meat!”

Yet Ling Han smiled, and said, “Will you pay True Origin Stones for it?”

“Yes!” Li Weiwei said impatiently, “Quick, hand it over, I want to eat to my heart’s content today!”

“Take care you don’t become fat!” Ling Han said with a grin.

“Hahahaha, no matter how much I eat, I won’t become fat. I have a natural perfect figure!” Li Weiwei declared proudly.

Ling Han picked up that completely cooked piece of meat and placed it onto Li Weiwei’s plate.

The girl was instantly ecstatic, and hurriedly used her chopsticks to pick up her meat, beginning to eat delightfully again.

Ji Yun’er could not help but feel curious; was it really that delicious?

Li Weiwei was the Fourth Young Miss of the Left Minister; what exotic delicacies had she not eaten before? Yet now, she was actually so filled with “unbearable” anticipation. She elegantly picked up her chopsticks, plucked the barbequed meat, and took a light bite with her snow-white teeth.

To be honest, the way this meat was barbequed was really not all that impressive, but in a single bite, the strong aromatic taste of meat diffused out instantly in the mouth. That kind of delicious taste would really make even one’s spirit quiver.

How could it be so delicious?

She was more reserved, and also more restrained, but she still felt an urge to open her mouth wide and begin wolfing down the meat.

“Meow!” Right at this moment, a white shadow flashed past, and before the three of them could react, the two pieces of meat on the barbeque grill vanished. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“That white cat!” Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er both exclaimed simultaneously. Wasn’t it precisely that famous white cat on the wall of the courtyard they now saw? Its mouth held the two pieces of barbequed meat, and they could actually see the proud look on its face as if it was mocking the three of them.

... How about it? I still succeeded, didn’t I?

It devoured the meat ravenously, and in moments, the two pieces of meat were completely eaten. No wonder it was that fat.

This time, Ling Han had kept his guard up, but he still did not manage to stop it in time. Don’t just look at how this fat cat had such a rounded stomach—its speed was really incredibly fast.

“Waaah, that was my meat!” Li Weiwei instantly screamed out horribly, and angrily pointing out with a finger, said, “Damn cat, you dared to steal my meat; this is not over!”

Ling Han could not help but smile, and said, “That was my meat, all right? I know you’re very excited, but you should still distinguish between who’s the host and the guest.”

Li Weiwei humphed, and declared, “You are my man, so your meat naturally is mine as well!”

“Yi, this cat... this isn’t a cat; it’s the Divine Beast, White Tiger!” Small Tower suddenly exclaimed. “Yesterday, I had some suspicions, but could not confirm them. But now, I can definitely confirm that this must be a descendant of the White Tiger!”

Ling Han gave an”‘ah”. This round and fat cat actually wasn’t a cat, but a tiger? This had to be a mistaken reincarnation, right? How could it have possibly developed into this kind of creature? He could not help but ask mentally, “Are you sure?”

“Hoho, only a descendant of the White Tiger would exude such a noble air; there’s no mistake,” Small Tower answered.

“Is the White Tiger very strong?” Ling Han asked. He had seen a descendant of the True Dragon before, and even the latter could do nothing but be thrashed by his hand.

“Tsk, what you encountered could still be considered as a descendant of the True Dragon?” Small Tower scoffed. “At most, there was only a sliver of the bloodline of the True Dragon in him. However, this White Tiger cub is different. Its bloodline is extremely dense, but it seems to have suffered some serious injury, which led to it being unable to completely exhibit the true strength of its bloodline.”

“Hold on, just how strong is the White Tiger?” Ling Han asked.

“Do you know about the Genesis Tier?” Small Tower countered with a question of its own.

Was this not a nonsensical question?

“Hoho, if it was the White Tiger in prime condition, then a puff of its killing intent would be able to eliminate someone in the Genesis Tier,” Small Tower answered with disdain.

“Really?” Ling Han did not dare believe it. “Genesis Tier is the strongest ability of this world!”

“Even if both are on the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, there would still be a world of difference, right? What more when—”

“What more when what?”

“Nothing, just concentrate on your cultivation and don’t talk so much nonsense!”

Ling Han really felt like beating someone up. Wasn’t this topic started by this tsundere Tower? He did bother to argue, and asked, “Then how about the descendant of the White Tiger? Do you have the ability to tame it?”

“Heh, if I did not, would I speak so much nonsense with you?” Small Tower humphed.

Fine, it was acting tsundere again.

However, this time, Ling Han was not planning to bicker again. He asked, “How do we tame it? Wait, it has an owner!”

“With how proud the White Tiger is, how could it possibly serve trash the likes of the Heavenly Body Tier? Take out some Godly metal. The White Tiger has an elemental alignment of Metal, and can absorb the strength of Godly metal to increase its cultivation,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han gave an “ah”. Now, the Black Tower would be able to produce a piece of Godly metal every year. If he left it aside without using it, the quality of this piece of Godly metal could be endlessly boosted. But, only a single year had passed at present, so he only had that one piece of Godly metal in his possession.

“You cannot catch a wolf without being willing to sacrifice your child. This White Tiger is still young. You can establish a good relation with it now, and if you can cure its illness in the future, it would not be difficult for it to acknowledge you as its master. Even if it is... heh, it is still a very strong existence.” Small Tower said[1.The saying 舍不了孩子套不了狼 is literally translated here, but basically means nothing ventured, nothing gained.].

Ling Han considered the matter, then took out the Godly metal. In any case, he was still some time away from Immortal level. Moreover, as long as he had a large amount of True Origin Stones in hand, wouldn’t it be a simple matter to bug Godly metal?

“Yi, this is Godly metal!” Li Weiwei was the princess of the Left Minister’s Residence, after all, so she recognized it for what it was with a single look. She could not help but be surprised. “Blockhead, where did you get the Godly metal from? It can’t be you stole it from somewhere, right?”

Ling Han ignored her, and merely waved the Godly metal around in front of that fat cat, and asked, “Fat and round cat, do you want this piece of Godly metal?”

The fat cat instantly puffed up in indignation. It was the descendant of the White Tiger, so how noble was it? ‘This guy really is a mortal indeed, to not know how amazing I am!’ It pretended to be aloof. ‘Do you think that just because you’re waving around a piece of whatever Godly metal, I’ll be hooked? You are really looking down on me!’

Ling Han thought for a moment, then drew out a ball of wool from within the Black Tower, and tossed it onto the ground.

“Meow!” the fat cat instantly could not restrain itself, and pounced over. Directly pouncing onto the ball, it finally realized it was much too unreserved, actually being seduced into revealing its true nature by a ball. It hurriedly crouched down, and using its claws, combed through its whiskers, putting on an act of being aloof. However, its eyes kept uncontrollably gliding towards that ball; it really wanted to pounce on the ball again.

Seeing its actions, Li Weiwei broke out into an abrupt bout of hearty laughter. Ji Yun’er was more reserved, yet still could not help covering her small mouth with a hand as a smile turned up the corners of her lips.

“Here’s another!” Ling Han threw out another ball of wool.

“Meow!” The fat cat, unable to restrain itself, pounced.
