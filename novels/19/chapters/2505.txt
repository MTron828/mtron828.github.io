Chapter 2506: Coming back to life

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A person that Ji Xueming had clearly killed suddenly stood back up. How could he not feel a chill rise up his spine at the sight?

It should be known that while there were in this world supreme elites that could destroy stars and crumble the ground with a single move, and could evaporate the sea with a single breath, there was definitely no possible way a dead person could be revived.

Yes, a Heavenly Venerate could do it, but even a Heavenly Venerate would have to pay an exorbitant price for it. It was definitely not something as simple as just a casual move.

If it was to be claimed that Li Juan had been revived by a Heavenly Venerate, Ji Xueming wouldn’t believe it even if it killed him.

But the problem here was that Li Juan really had stood up.

“Senior Sister Li!” Luo Xing was filled with pleasant surprise, but at the same time also felt slightly cautious because who knew whether Li Juan was of the same flock as Ji Xueming, putting an act on for his sake merely for the sake of launching a sneak attack on him.

Of course, the chance of this was too low. Luo Xing was already poisoned at present, and the enemy had as many as 11 Ascending Origin Tiers. No matter how he thought, there would be no need to use such a low-handed trick.

“Ji, Xue, Ming!” Li Juan spat out each word, her voice filled with fury.

Ji Xueming forcefully kept his cool. He stared at Li Juan. “I do not believe that a dead person can come back to life. You probably have some kind of treasure to substitute for you, right?”

How could Li Juan have anything? She only knew that a sword had struck her from behind, and she had been completely unguarded, but just when the blade of the sword had been about to touch the back of her head, a powerful force had pushed her down, and then she could not move at all. Hearing Ji Xueming’s performance, she was practically exploding with anger.

Subsequently, she suddenly recovered mobility, and then stood back up.

In truth, she was also very confused.

Could it be that there was an elite helping them in secret?

......

She naturally would not be giving him any explanation. She rebuked, “You shameless man, you will not get an easy death!”

Actually, Ji Xueming would not feel the slightest fear towards a living person. What he was concerned about now was just why Li Juan had managed to come back to life. He smiled slightly, and said, “Senior Sister Li, could it be that you have forgotten my previous words? I have always been the type to leave nothing to chance.”

Clearly, it was not just Luo Xing he had poisoned. Even Li Juan had not been exempted.

Li Juan’s expression instantly changed. Ji Xueming stabbing her from behind should have only been a whim of his as he just happened to have the opportunity to do so, but poisoning both her and Luo Xing definitely had to have been a long-planned conspiracy.

He had the intentions, and they were unguarded against him. Who would have thought that a fellow disciple whom they had lived with for tens of millions of years would actually be an undercover agent from an enemy sect?

“Though I have to expend a little more effort, it has absolutely no effect on the greater picture,” Ji Xueming said. WIth a wave of his hand, the 10 Ascending Origin Tiers from the Red Flower Sect immediately walked over, approaching Luo Xing and Li Juan.

Both Li Juan and Luo Xing frowned deeply. Now that things had progressed this far, it seemed like they could predict their end by now.

“Sigh!” Ling Han sighed. Was he really a bringer of calamity that would encounter trouble wherever he went?

He had only wanted to find some place to settle down and ascertain the situation. Then, he could find out where the Empress and the others were, and go over calmly. Why wasn’t he allowed to relax just a bit?

“Brother Ling, what are you sighing for?” Ji Xueming asked laughingly. “You have no need to fear. I will not kill you. I will study absolutely thoroughly a prodigy of cultivation like you. This kind of ability… I very much wish to possess it!”

To practically cultivate the Hidden Radiance Stage completely within half a year’s time was a kind of natural talent that could only be described as legendary, which filled him with curiosity, as well as greed.

Ling Han broke into a smile. “Could it be that you are not curious just how this woman came back to life?”

Ji Xueming laughed loudly. “Could it be it was you behind it, then?”

“I have never coveted the merits of others, but I would not hide my actions, either. Of course, it was me.” Ling Han nodded.

Ji Xueming would naturally not believe it. Ling Han was but a mere Hidden Radiance Stage. If he did have that kind of strength, wouldn’t even pigs fly?

“Kill them!” he said lowly.

The 10 members of the Red Flower Sect charged out. They had long since lost their patience.

“Begone!” Ling Han roared, and his voice instantly rumbled out like thunder, deafening and ear-splitting.

Every single person felt their mind buzz, and then all that was left was a complete blank.

When they came back to their senses, they were all looking at Ling Han with eyes filled with absolute shock. The might of a roar was actually so frightening; just how terrifyingly strong was this person then?

“I-it really was you!” Ji Xueming pointed a finger at Ling Han as he stuttered, his hand trembling slightly.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He had secretly given Li Juan a slight shove when Ji Xueming had attacked just now. As for the blood, that was real. Li Juan had indeed sustained injury, but it was not too severe.

He gave another shout. “Azure Sun Celestial King, please come out for a meeting!”

Boom, the sound turned into a terrifying ripple that reverberated throughout the Peaceful Sun Mountain.

The shouts of Luo Xing and Li Juan could not be transmitted because of their limited strength, but Ling Han’s Body Art had directly reached the peak stage of the Fifth Heaven. With this shout, there was no issue to envelop the whole of the Peaceful Sun Mountains.

In merely an instant, a figure streaked through the air and arrived. This person was enshrouded in two streaks of peculiar light. This was a symbol that could not be any more obvious. This person was a Second Heaven Celestial King.

The Azure Sun Celestial King.

“How dare you!” The Azure Sun Celestial King’s eyes swept over them, and he instantly humphed. Members of the Red Flower Sect actually dared come here to cause trouble; were they really planning to step all over him?

Though he could not travel far, it was fine for him to just leave slightly for a short while.

Ji Xueming shuddered fearfully, and he knelt onto the ground with a sudden turn of his eyes. “Master, you have finally come. I thought I would never be able to see you again. Both Senior Brother Luo and Junior Sister Li are traitors, and they were the ones who poisoned Missus!”

‘This…!’

To say nothing of both Li Juan and Luo Xing feeling utter fury, even Ling Han was slightly surprised. Could a person really be as shameless as this?

“Master, he is spouting rubbish. He is the undercover agent from the Red Flower Sect!” Luo Xing hurriedly exclaimed.

Li Juan also nodded repeatedly. The moment the Azure Sun Celestial King appeared, they had subconsciously ignored Ling Han, because in their hearts and eyes, their master was the strongest person of all, and Ling Han was not enshrouded by any peculiar light, so how could he be a Celestial King?

The Azure Sun Celestial King naturally held his own judgment. Just look at the situation now—10 elites of the Red Flower Sect had surrounded Luo Xing and Li Juan, and Ji Xueming was standing outside of the siege—was that still not enough to describe the problem?

“Unfilial disciple!” This Celestial King humphed coldly. Now that things had reached this point, he naturally understood the reason behind his wife’s illness.

He moved.?Boom, the might of a Celestial King surged out.

Even if there were 11 Ascending Origin Tiers on Ji Xueming’s side, so what? The difference between a Celestial King and an Ascending Origin Tier was like the difference between an adult and an infant. No matter how big the advantage in numbers was, there was no way that the gap in strength between the two sides could be compensated.

With the descent of a single palm strike,?pa, pa, pa,?the 10 Ascending Origin Tiers were all turned into pools of blood instantly, and Ji Xueming was apprehended. This unfilial disciple definitely could not be executed so easily.

Ji Xueming trembled in fear. He was in despair, and his eyes were set on Ling Han. If it were not because of him, how could he have fallen to this?

Ling Han shook his head. “Ask yourself this question first, do you have the right to fault others?”

“This person is…” The Azure Sun Celestial King looked towards Li Juan and Luo Xing. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“His name is Ling Han, and we encountered him at the Cloudy Dream Marsh. Just now, it seemed like he was the one who helped me out of a crisis,” Luo Xing said. He could not distinguish Ling Han’s strength at all, and could only offer a vague description.

“Oh?” The Azure Sun Celestial King paused slightly. “Friend, please join me on the mountain, and allow me to serve you some fragrant tea.”
