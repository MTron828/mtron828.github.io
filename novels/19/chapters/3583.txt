Chapter 3584: What a coincidence

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was not strange for Niu Jianhua to be able to make it into the top 32. After all, he was a one-star genius, but for Niu Jianhua, when he discovered that Ling Han was still in the courtyard, he was naturally greatly shocked.

Afterwards, he found out that Ling Han was the lucky one who had obtained the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle.

No wonder. He was a Grandmaster of Divination, so it was naturally very normal that he would be the first to find the celestial technique.

He didn’t go to the mountain peak to search, because he was the descendant of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, so what secret technique couldn’t he get? Did he need to snatch a low-level celestial technique?

What a joke.

However, because he had shamelessly abandoned Ling Han and Xiao Zhixuan, he couldn’t bring himself to greet Ling Han, so he pretended not to know.

A night passed, and Ling Han’s comprehension of the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle had improved further. However, exactly how much might he could unleash, he would only know after battling.

When the sun rose, he began to cultivate.

He opened the apertures on his body, and absorbed the power of heaven and earth, helping to push the expansion of his meridians.

This process would only end when he attained Mystery Realm Tier.

There was no need for Mystery Realm Tier elites to open up their meridians. Instead, they would open up an area inside their bodies to store their mystical power.

The Mystery Realm that each person created was different. Some people used their heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as their accomodation space, while others were inventive and used their brains as their accomodation space, but the majority opened up their Dantian.

There was actually no real end to the Mystery Realm Tier. You could open up a bit of space to leap over the Celestial Gate, or you could stay on this cultivation level for a very, very long time, and continuously expand this storage space. Because Mystery Realm Tier only determined the “lasting time” of a martial artist’s battle prowess, the one that truly influenced battle prowess was Enlightenment Tier. This tier could still continue to expand the meridians and veins, and the wider the meridian, the more mystical power would be delivered with a single strike, and naturally, the greater the power would be.

Of course, if Mystery Realm Tiers were too sloppy in their cultivation, they would completely exhaust their power in a few exchanges, which wouldn’t do either.

Enlightenment Tier was extremely important.

Some people had broken through after opening 36 apertures, and in this lifetime, they would only be able to use 36 apertures to absorb the power of heaven and earth forever. Compared to those who had broken through to the second and third tiers, the gap was eternal, and could not possibly disappear.

Ling Han naturally would not be satisfied with the first tier. In fact, the third tier in fact was not his end either. He wanted to open all the Hidden Apertures, and lay down the most solid foundation.

After half an hour, he stopped. In about a few more days, he would be able to experience a leap in his level of being, and by then, who knew how many more aperture openings he would be able to unlock.

After breakfast, he revised the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle. Seeing that it was about time, he pushed open the doors and left, heading towards the Tai

Yi Pavilion.

—Niu Jianhua had left before him, so the two of them did not meet.

Tai Yi Pavilion wasn’t far, and Ling Han arrived after walking for over ten minutes. Looking at the time, it was still five minutes away from ten o’clock.

En, his calculations were very accurate.

Ling Han’s eyes wandered over, and saw three familiar faces.

Niu Jianhua, Sima Huai, Liu Huayun, and the others were all exuding powerful auras. Naturally, they were all well-known figures of Mystery Realm Tier. The majority should be one-star geniuses.

When Sima Huai and Liu Huayun saw him, they both revealed expressions of both fury and wariness.

The Foundation Building elite from before walked out, his hands crossed behind his back. Though it was very obvious that he was putting on an act, in front of these Mystery Realm Tiers, he was naturally fully qualified.

“The real tournament begins today,” he stated calmly, “Later, everyone come and draw lots. Number one versus number thirty-two, number two versus number thirty-one, and so on.”

“In battle, aside from Talisman Weapons, one can’t use any kind of technique.” “After one side admits defeat, the other side must stop, or I will kill him with my own hands.”

“If you do not admit defeat, then whether it is crippling or killing you, there would be no need to bear any responsibility.”

“If you’re afraid, then hurry up and admit defeat.”

He paused, giving everyone time to think, but it was only a few seconds. Seeing that no one spoke, he waved his hand, “Then let’s begin drawing lots.”

Everyone stepped forward, one after another, drawing a number.

Ling Han looked over, and saw that he had drawn the number “nine”. “First match, number one versus number thirty-two. Hurry up and step forward. Don’t dawdle around.” The Foundation Building elite clearly didn’t have much patience.

True, as he saw it, Mystery Realm Tier was like an ant to him. Now, he had to take charge of the battles of Mystery Realm Tier against Mystery Realm Tier, which naturally made him very displeased.

The two of them stepped out, and immediately began an intense battle.

To Ling Han’s disappointment, though these two people’s battle prowess was quite strong, they hadn’t reached the level of one-star genius yet. However, because their abilities were close, they battled endlessly for more than an hour, using all kinds of methods. In the end, it was still because one of them had more power, and finally won.

This was the benefit of cultivating Mystery Realms for a long time. Once they engaged in a drawn-out battle, the effects would be immediately apparent.

Then, number two versus number thirty-one.

The battle ended very quickly. The thirty-first prodigy was a one-star genius, and it only took him a few minutes to end the battle.

One after another, battles continued.

“Ninth versus Twenty-fourth.”

Ling Han walked out, yet saw that his opponent was actually Niu Jianhua. Niu Jianhua obviously had not expected this either. An expression of surprise appeared on his face, but then he nodded, and said, “You are no match for this young master, so hurry up and admit defeat.”

Ling Han was proficient in divination, after all. If he went to explore ancient sites in the future, he might be able to help. Thus, he didn’t want Ling Han to be publicly defeated, to avoid awkwardness in the future.

When these words fell, Liu Huayun and Sima Huai both looked disdainful.

Where did you get such confidence from?

Ling Han shook his head, and said with a smile, “It would be better for you to forfeit. I am determined to get first place.”

Niu Jianhua faltered for a moment, then laughed in spite of himself. What kind of joke was that? You still want to be first? He humphed, and said, “You are only lucky enough to have obtained a celestial technique, which allowed you to directly enter into the actual tournament. If I moved, I would be able to defeat you with a single move, so you had best just admit defeat.

“Enough with the f*cking nonsense, hurry up and fight!” the Foundation Building elite said coldly. He was extremely impatient.

Niu Jianhua cursed vulgarity in his heart, and was also angered. Since when did even Foundation Building Tier cultivators dare to reprimand him?

However, he was not arrogant to the extent of being arrogant here, so he immediately humphed and said, “Can Ye, then don’t blame me for being rude!” He was also determined to obtain the Star Origin Fruit.

Xiu, he finally moved. With a tap of his foot, he charged towards Ling Han. He shot out a palm strike, causing flames to fill the skies.

He was not the kind to be merciful, and would not hold back in his attacks.

Ling Han unleashed the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle, and stretched out both hands. Instantly, they became crimson gold in colour.

Seeing this scene, the Foundation Building elite couldn’t help but look stunned. His hands had turned golden. This was a sign that he had tentatively grasped the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle.

However, this brat had only obtained this celestial technique for two days, so how had he already mastered it?

What a monster!
