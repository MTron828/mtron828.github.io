3059 Incomparably Coincidental

‘Are you trying to go back on your word?’ Wang Quanhe thought to himself. ‘You’re already a Celestial King. Who else can be called a mighty figure?’

He was clearly going back on his word.

However, how could he dare to vent his anger on a Celestial King? He didn’t even need his opponent to make a move. Any random person from this manor could easily kill him.

He had been too young and naive, after all. With this thought in mind, his face naturally revealed it.

Prince Ma Xuan smiled faintly. He naturally knew what Wang Quanhe was thinking. In fact, he was also very surprised.

A powerful Heavenly Venerate had gone through so much trouble just to find such an extremely ordinary person?

He couldn’t see what was so outstanding about Wang Quanhe that he was actually so important to a Heavenly Venerate.

If it weren’t for Ling Han, he would have slapped Wang Quanhe to death long ago if he dared to show such emotions. However, he could only entertain the thought now.

He knew how important this matter was to Ling Han.

“You—” He was just about to speak when he was startled because he suddenly received Ling Han’s voice transmission.

He hurriedly stood up, and said respectfully, “Greetings, milord!”

Wang Quanhe was shocked. There really was someone more impressive and awesome than Prince Ma Xuan?

He only saw a blur before his eyes, and there was already another person in the courtyard.

He was very young. His face was like jade, and his hair was jet-black. It wasn’t tied up with a crown, and it fluttered slightly, giving him an indescribable elegance.

“Greetings, milord.” His mind being alert at the arrival of a surge of good fortune, he knelt down in front of Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a finger, and lightly pressed it on Wang Quanhe’s forehead. He immediately discovered the existence of a speck of light in Wang Quanhe’s mind.

This was a person he was looking for.

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han was suddenly startled. He had discovered even more things.

Their bloodlines resonated.

This was actually his descendant?

How was that possible? This was only a medium-level dimension. Why would his descendants appear here?

No, it was indeed possible.

Back then, when the five ultimate elites attacked, Ling Xi, Ling Jianxue, and the others were all captured, and the descendants of the Ling Clan scattered in all directions. Although most of them had fled to various corners of the Profound Negative Realm, there was still a possibility that one of them had escaped here.

Crossing 17 dimensions was extremely difficult, but it wasn’t impossible after so much time had passed.

The Ling Clan had once been at its peak, and there would always be some precious treasures that could be passed down to allow travel through dimensions.

After arriving here, the descendants of the Ling Clan had settled down. However, perhaps when they had been traveling through the dimensions, this bloodline of the Ling Clan had also suffered heavy injuries, resulting in the death of all the elites, and only Severing Mundane Tiers could emerge from this line of his descendants.

In fact… not long ago, their entire clan had been annihilated.

Intense anger instantly rose in Ling Han’s heart, but after thinking about it, he still decided to let Wang Quanhe deal with it himself.

“Thank you for your hard work,” he said to Prince Ma Xuan.

Prince Ma Xuan didn’t dare to accept the credit at all, and hurriedly said humbly, “It’s my duty to do things for you, milord. It’s my duty.”

In reality, as long as he had a relationship with Ling Han, it would be equivalent to obtaining a talisman that exempted him from death. Which Celestial King or even Heavenly Venerate would dare to attack him?

This favor was bigger than the sky.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “You go ahead with your business.”

“Yes, milord.” Prince Ma Xuan quickly left obediently.

Although he was very curious about why Ling Han wanted to find such an ordinary person, and what secrets he was hiding.

However, curiosity killed the cat. He was just a nobody, so how could he dare to interfere with the matters of a Heavenly Venerate?

After Prince Ma Xuan left, Ling Han looked at Wang Quanhe, and asked, “What wish do you have?”

‘Here it is.’

Wang Quanhe immediately became excited, and said, “Milord, I have a deep feud. I would like to ask you to help me eliminate my enemies.”

“There’s no need to call me lord. My name is Ling Han, and you… can just call me senior.” Ling Han thought for a moment, and decided not to reveal the relationship between the two of them for the time being.

“Yes, Senior,” Wang Quanhe hurriedly replied.

Ling glanced at him, and said, “I won’t make a move.”

Wang Quanhe instantly felt as if he had been struck by lightning, and his excited expression instantly froze. His face was filled with disappointment as he looked towards Ling Han, his lips trembling slightly.

Why? He wanted to ask, but he couldn’t make a sound.

“Don’t you want to personally ask that woman why she betrayed you?” Ling Han said with a smile.

‘Hmm?’

Wang Quanhe was shocked. “Milord, how did you know—”

Ling Han had just tapped a finger on his forehead just now, and he had already flipped through all of Wang Quanhe’s memories, so he naturally knew what Wang Quanhe had encountered.

“I won’t make a move, but I can teach you so you can personally take revenge,” Ling Han said.

After being stunned for a moment, Wang Quanhe hurriedly knelt down. “Disciple Wang Quanhe pays his respects to Master—”

Before he could finish his words, he was already lifted up by Ling Han.

“I won’t take in any more disciples.” Ling Han shook his head. What a joke. This was his descendant. If he were to take him in as a disciple, wouldn’t the hierarchy become a mess? “I need something from you, and in return, I’ll let you obtain enough strength to take revenge. How about that?”

Disappointment appeared on Wang Quanhe’s face. How impressive and awesome was an existence that even a Celestial King addressed as Lord?

Unfortunately, the other party was unwilling to accept him as a disciple.

But as long as he could take revenge, this was enough.

“Deal.” He nodded.

“After you avenge your family, I will take you away from here,” Ling Han said.

Apart from containing the secret code of life, these people with specks of light in their minds also had their own unique characteristics. If he could unravel them, it would be very useful.

Furthermore, this one was his descendant.

Ling Han taught Wang Quanhe how to send out his divine sense to probe, and the two of them resonated, allowing Wang Quanhe to discover the existence of another ball of light in his body and obtain the information contained within.

Wang Quanhe sent this information back to Ling Han, and Ling Han taught him how to cultivate.

What was Ling Han’s cultivation level, and how many natural treasures did he possess?

Even a stupid pig would be able to become a Celestial King if they were buried in endless resources.

Just seven days later, Wang Quanhe had reached the Dividing Soul Tier.

Ling Han had no intention of building a stable foundation for Wang Quanhe. Wang Quanhe did not have any outstanding natural talent in cultivation, and was just exceptionally lucky.

For example, if Wang Quanhe had to choose one out of two, three, or even one out of 10,000, he would always be able to find the right one. If Ling Han allowed him to venture into an ancient site, it would probably be as easy as walking on flat ground for him.

His specialty was that he was extremely lucky.

The Dividing Soul Tier was definitely enough for him to take revenge. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Go.” Ling Han waved his hand. He wanted to properly digest the secret code of life he had just obtained.

Wang Quanhe kowtowed respectfully to Ling Han. Seven days ago, he would never have imagined that he could undergo such an earth-shattering change in just seven days.

Towards Ling Han, he was filled with gratitude, even if he also knew that what Ling Han had obtained from his mind was definitely extraordinary.

To be able to help him avenge his blood feud was an unparalleled kindness.

He left Prince Xuan’s Manor, and prepared to leave the city and return to Qianshui Town.

But just as he reached the city gate, he was stopped by someone.

“Stop right there!” one of the guards shouted. “You can’t leave.”
