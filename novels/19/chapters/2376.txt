Chapter 2377: Ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe

The large black dog had gone into seclusion, and the Rain Emperor had also begun his seclusion. They had glimpsed a brand-new path of cultivation.

Ling Han gave some guidance to Yan Xianlu and the others. These people were only monarch stars, with Evolution Index reaching only up to 9, while Ling Han was a supreme monarch star, whose Evolution Index was as high as 11. He had already completely surpassed them, and it could be claimed that they were on two completely different levels.

Then, he began to mull over his next move.

In terms of cultivation resources, he had an abundance. Just Ancestral King blood essence alone was something he had a great amount of. To say nothing of helping him attain the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, reaching Great Accomplishment level should be no problem, at least.

Then he asked the women where they would like to travel. After all, they had been away from the Celestial Realm for so many years.

“Let’s visit Father and Mother-in-law.”

In the end, the women reached an agreement.

Ling Han nodded. He, too, wished to see his parents, and his son as well. However, Ling Jianxue had forgotten his parents now that he had his own wife, and who knew where he was enjoying life now.

When children had grown up, it was up to themselves to walk their own paths.

Ling Han decided to first see his parents, and then visit the Heavenly Saint Palace. That was also a place that had nurtured him. He also had to make a trip back to the Eastern Celestial Realm. His uncle, cousin, and other relatives were still there, as well as Little Stone, Asura Demon Emperor, and the other people or “non-humans” that had been the earliest to follow him.

They set out, and they arrived where Ling Dongxing and his wife lived in seclusion after a six-month-long journey.

Seeing their son and daughters-in-law return, the old couple was very happy, but when they saw that there were no new grandsons or granddaughters, they couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed. Why was it that there was still no good news even with so many wives?

Yue Hongchang even deliberately pulled the women aside for some quiet words, discreetly asking if it was her son that had some kind of problem in “that” aspect, or was he being too aloof, and the women all flushed bright red at this.

Ling Yueyan and Cheng Zilong were also here. When she saw Ling Yueyan, Ling Yueyan naturally called out “brother” sweetly, while Cheng Zilong appeared very terrified. After all, Ling Han had previously left behind a powerful psychological trauma for him.

Ling Han stayed for a good many days, and gave his parents and sister a great many cultivation resources. He was also continuously cultivating every day, his cultivation level presently rising rapidly.

From the Second Secret onwards, he had been cultivating the Regulations of the Foreign Realm, and now he had to cultivate again right from the beginning, replenishing the Regulations of the Celestial Realm, which helped him to again achieve a new understanding of Regulations.

Especially when he was still standing at the height of the overlord of a realm, this understanding was naturally even more profound.

With time acceleration effects, he already raised his cultivation level to the height of Eleventh Secret in just a short three years. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Now that he had reached this level, he had actually already returned to the Ascending Origin Tier because a portion of his Origin Power had already been converted to Source Power, but he was in no rush to break through. He planned to settle himself and strengthen his foundations further.

He planted the Reincarnation Tree. Since the Black Tower could no longer be used for a very long time, the Reincarnation Tree naturally had to be moved as well.

By now, his need for the Reincarnation Tree was not too great. He had already cultivated a time celestial physique, and he himself could turn into the flow of time, which was more useful than anything else.

According to his parents, Ling Jianxue had returned several hundred years ago, but had left quickly afterwards.

When Ling Han knew his son was fine, he was assured. Furthermore, as long as he was in the Celestial Realm, he would have an instinctive feeling about the safety of his family.

Hence, when it was the fourth year, Ling Han was already restless, and decided to leave.

“Let’s go and take a look at the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe first,” the Empress suddenly said.

Ling Han recalled how he had promised the Empress that they would go to the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe when they had been in the Ancient Realm. However, due to various incidents previously, this promise had never been fulfilled.

Originally, the Empress wanted to return to her ancestral grounds primarily for the sake of completing her Divine Fetus, but now she had cultivated the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique, which could be considered the strongest physique in this world. What else could be stronger than time itself?

Hence, completing the physique of the Nine Snake Tribe had become secondary, though having another physique would still be slightly beneficial.

Returning was mainly a preoccupation for her, originating from the hope that had been passed through the generations to the Empress.

“All right. We will go to the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe first, then return to the Eastern Celestial Realm,” Ling Han decided.

The group set out, heading towards the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe.

Of course, there was a problem with this. They did not know where the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe was.

Thankfully, the bloodline that the Empress had inherited contained some memories about her ancestral grounds. When she extracted them and compared them to a map, they finally found the location of the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe after a long period of study.

It was in the Scorching Flames Heaven, which was still considerably far from where they were.

With the existence of Transference Portals, the journey was naturally no problem. They used Transference Portals one after another, saving countless amounts of time on the journey. About half a year later, they entered the Scorching Flames Heaven.

The ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe was in the western parts of the Scorching Flames Heaven. There was a great sea there, and there was an island in this sea, which was named Nine Snake Island.

They arrived at the coast, and Ling Han took out a large ship from his Spatial God Tool. Because of the Black Tower, he had also developed the habit of placing various items in his Spatial God Tool.

The group braved the winds and the waves, and several days later, a massive island appeared ahead of them. It could be seen that this island originally should have had a massive mountain, but now it had been severed in the middle, and was only about three kilometers tall, looking very abrupt.

The Empress’s beautiful eyes widened slightly. She had finally returned to her ancestral grounds, which made her feel slightly excited.

“Let’s go.”

They disembarked and landed on the island.

The ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe had already become ruins many, many years ago. That was because the ancestor of the Nine Great Ancestral Flames had chosen to stand on the same side as the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable all those years ago, and had suffered an attack from the forces that belonged to the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and Green Flames Heavenly Venerate as a result, leading to many deaths of this tribe as the rest fled.

The Empress was feeling rueful. She had finally realized the long-cherished wish of her parents, grandparents, and countless of her elders, and arrived at the ancestral grounds of their tribe.

She walked very slowly, touching gently every blade of grass, every tree, every stone, and every pillar of this place.

“Who goes there? To actually dare barge into the ancestral grounds of our Luan Clan!” An admonishment rang out, and a man suddenly shot down ahead of them. He looked to be in his twenties, dressed all in black and majestic in appearance.

‘Huh?’

Everyone exchanged looks, all appearing slightly surprised. Wasn’t the Nine Snake Tribe almost fully exterminated? Even if there were some fortunate people who had managed to escape that entered into the Ancient Realm, how could they appear here?

It should be known that it was practically impossible to return to the Celestial Realm after entering into the Ancient Realm.

…In the past, just how many Forbidden Lands were there in the Ancient Realm that had been forces that had fled from the Celestial Realm? But after so many years, which one of them had managed to return to the Celestial Realm?

Not even a single one.

“Your surname is Luan?” Ling Han asked smilingly. If the other was really a descendant of the Nine Snake Tribe, this was inevitably a piece of good news for the Empress. She had finally found family, and was no longer alone.

“I am Luan Tianjun!” this young man declared proudly, and then looked askance at Ling Han and his group, putting on a lofty stance. However, when his eyes passed over such exquisite beauties like the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou, he couldn’t help but look stunned.

“Just how many of you are there?” Ling Han asked further.

“What are you asking this for?” Luan Tianjun’s expression became alert, while also appearing slightly impatient. Just who was he? The Luan Clan had the bloodline of a Celestial King, noble and lofty in status. They could be considered the descendants of emperors.

“We’re planning to visit family,” Ling Han replied, smiling.
