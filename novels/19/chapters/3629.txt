At first, the Bodhi Tree had already wilted, and in fact, even half of its crown had been sliced off. However, when the moon reached the middle of the sky, it began to regrow under the nourishment of the moonlight, and the crown that had disappeared reappeared.

“An… Ma… Ni… Ba… Mi… Gu…”

The Six Characters Bright King Curse sounded continuously. A breeze blew over, and the Bodhi Tree vibrated slightly. The leaves rustled, producing a pleasant sound.

Ling Han hurriedly patted the little loli’s head, waking her up.

“What are you doing? I want to sleep!” Tang Yun’er stretched lazily, her eyes hazy, her expression filled with bitterness and deep hatred.

What she hated the most was being woken up when she was sleeping soundly. She would be upset even if it was her own mother waking her up.

“Idiot, you don’t want the inheritance of the Buddhist Race?” Ling Han called out.

Ah! The little loli was quick-witted, and immediately lost her sleepiness.

Her eyes widened, and she naturally saw this amazing scene as well.

“Where’s the inheritance?” she asked.

“Don’t speak, just watch carefully.”

The Bodhi Tree swayed continuously, and after an unknown amount of time, a monk in a Buddhist robe suddenly appeared. He sat cross-legged under the Bodhi Tree, and his head was completely bald. However, there was actually a halo of light around him.

“Having sprouted a Buddhist ring, this is a great elite of the Buddhist Race!” The little loli knew what was what, and immediately whispered.

Is it that person?” Ling Han asked. He was naturally referring to the Ancestral Buddha, the Ancestral King who had founded the Buddhist Race’s territory, invincible in this world for an era.

The little loli shook her head, “Impossible. If Ancestral Buddha left a shadow, then his aura would be extremely terrifying. We couldn’t possibly be so close. This should be a Bodhisattva.”

According to the hierarchy of the Buddhist Race, Ancestral Buddha represented the Ancestral King, the Buddha represented the Saint, the Bodhisattva represented the Venerate Tier, and the Arhat represented the Sect Master, so this was a Venerate Tier.

Even on the Moonlight Planet, this was still a top-notch great elite.

Ling Han couldn’t help but widen his eyes in shock. Would this Bodhisattva teach him the Six Characters Bright King Curse?

However, what disappointed the two of them was that this monk was only sitting cross-legged and cultivating. What inheritance was there?

Had he waited for nothing again?

Ling Han was unwilling to give up. After a long while, xiu, a leaf fell.

The Bodhi Tree had long since withered to death, so how could it have leaves?

Ling Han stretched out a hand. Coincidentally, the tree leaf landed near him, and he easily caught it in his hand.

Instantly, an indescribable power surged violently inside Ling Han’s body, turning into a majestic voice that was chanting something. It seemed like a song, but also seemed like a chant.

Ling Han’s heart clenched. Could this be the inheritance of the Buddhist Race?

He hurriedly focused on capturing every single word, but they were extremely vague, and it was extremely difficult to capture them.

After half a day, he finally grasped one word — An.

An of the Six Characters Bright King Curse.

This was the Six Characters Bright King Curse?

Ling Han opened his mouth, “An!”

Boom! An indescribable power surged out, bright and clear, and thought-provoking. In fact, one could even see the glow of Buddha.

Ling, Ling Han, have you learnt the Six Characters Bright King Curse?” The little loll got a scare. Though she could also shout the word “An”, without a special cultivation technique to coordinate with it, this was only an ordinary word, and did not have any special effects.

Ling Han wanted to capture it again, but the leaf in his hand had already turned into shards of light, not leaving a single bit behind.

The power in his body disappeared, and the majestic voice also disappeared.

Ling Han was astonished. Had he really learnt a single word?

He recalled, and then came to a realization. As it turned out, the process of capturing sound was the process of cultivation. The fact that he could hear the word “an” meant that he had successfully grasped the cultivation technique. This kind of teaching was really amazing.

Ling Han explained to the little loli, making the little loli excited.

“Ling Han, the next leaf is mine!” she emphasized.

Ling Han chuckled before turning around to leave.

He also needed to stabilize himself. Though he could recite the word “An”, he was not very proficient, and needed to practice hard.

Furthermore, there were too many details that needed to be studied.

The little loli waited for the second leaf to fall, while Ling Han was perfecting his “An” chant.

However, Tang Yun’er waited for an entire night without any results. When the sun rose on the second day, the strange phenomenon disappeared, and the Bodhi Tree became wilted and shriveled again. What leaf was left?

“I’m about to die from fury. I didn’t sleep all night!” the little loli shouted in anger.

Meanwhile, Ling Han faced the rising sun and started to cultivate. He had to speed up his cultivation and advance into the Mystery Realm Tier as soon as possible.

Ling Han and Tang Yun’er naturally wouldn’t leave since they hadn’t obtained the Six Characters Bright King Curse yet. They would rest during the day, and wait for night to come for a fierce battle.

However, Ling Han only slept for four hours, and he was already energetic. He once again studied the “An” chant. Even though there was only one word, combined with the cultivation technique, there were all kinds of changes’.

It could suppress evil, it could clear one’s mind, and it was profound and deep. After a whole day, Ling Han couldn’t contain his joy. The Six Characters Bright King Curse was indeed worthy of being the ultimate technique of the Buddhist Race. Its significance was extremely great. Using it to shout at himself would allow his spirit to become even more stable.

This was natural. His own spirit was not stable enough, so how could he speak of suppressing evil and expelling the demons?

At night, the moon hung high in the sky, and the strange phenomenon reappeared. The Bodhi Tree shone brilliantly again, and all the wilted leaves instantly grew out, adorning the entire tree. Not long after, that Bodhisattva appeared again, comprehending Dao underneath the Bodhi Tree.

Because he had grasped an “An” character, he naturally understood a portion of dharma. Ling Han instantly saw through even more.

That Bodhisattva’s comprehension was not completely unchanged.

The leaves of the Bodhi Tree dimmed and glowed, and there was a mysterious rhythm to it.

He grasped this rhythm, and couldn’t help but immerse himself in it. Vaguely, he discovered that there was Buddhist chanting in his mind, which was thought-provoking, and made him acknowledge it from the spiritual level. He wanted to submit, and from now onwards, it was his duty to expiate evil.

Ling Han suddenly faltered, and couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.

This Buddhist technique was too terrifying. He had only comprehended it for a short while, and he was actually immersed in it. His spirit was bewitched, and he wanted to convert into Buddhism.

Was this the power of the Ancestral King? This was practically besieging cities and plundering land without spilling blood. Once he unleashed his dharma, everyone under the heavens would be enlightened.

Ling Han hurriedly guarded his mind. He was only interested in the Six Characters Bright King Curse, but definitely did not want to become a member of the Buddhist Race, and be restricted by the rules of the Buddhist Race.

The night passed, and Ling Han’s understanding of the “An” character increased slightly. However, the little loli had waited for nothing the entire night, because no leaves of the Bodhi Tree had fallen at all. She was so angry that she directly jumped up, wanting to pluck it herself. In the end, a massive power descended, causing her to fall solidly.

Little Toffee, I think you’re destined to have no chance with Buddhism,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it!” The little loli placed her hands on her hips, her face filled with fury.

Why was it that such a stupid uncle could learn it, but she, an intelligent child, couldn’t?

The two of them continued to stay here determinedly. At night, Ling Han grasped the rhythm of the Bodhi Tree leaves and comprehended their amazing techniques. Meanwhile, the little loli stared at the top of her head, waiting for the leaves to fall..
