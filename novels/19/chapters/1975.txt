Chapter 1976: Heaven Destroying Nine Swords

Before Ling Han, Yan Xianlu had no option but to admit that there were prodigies more freakish than him in the world.

Ling Han’s cultivation talent was superior to his, and his battle prowess was also superior to his. In the domain of alchemy, Ling Han more so possessed the potential to become a grandmaster. Right now, even his talent in formations was miles ahead of Yan Xianlu’s. How could such a profoundly talented person exist in the world?

Following Ling Han and the Empress’ lead, they didn’t need to stop at any of the forks on the path. This naturally increased their speed by a significant amount. Two months later, several more people appeared before them.

This included Shu Yarong and the survivors from the Wide Prosperity Heaven. For example, Liu Jie and his younger sister.

Shu Yarong involuntarily furrowed her beautiful brows upon seeing Ling Han and the others. She was slightly astonished.

She had been certain that Ling Han and the others would need an exorbitant amount of time to comprehend the true meaning of the great dao. Now, however, they had actually caught up to her. What did this signify?

This signified that Ling Han and the others could crack this formation far quicker than her.

She was completely stunned. Others didn’t know, but she was naturally clear that she had been a Seventh Heaven Celestial King in her previous life. Because she had lived for so long, she was naturally well-versed with many different dao of the world.

Now, however, she had actually been beaten by a measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivator!

“Humph!” The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven all wore unfriendly expressions when they saw Ling Han and the others.

Half of the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven had been massacred by Ji Wuming, while some others had ventured down the wrong paths. They hadn’t been able to meet Shu Yarong and follow her. Thus, there were currently only seven of them in total.

“What are you harrumphing about?” Hu Niu said with a glare. “Who’s not happy? Come and fight me!”

No one answered her. Hu Niu’s fierceness was already deeply engraved in everyone’s mind. Of the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven, only Shu Yarong could rival her. As for the others... They were no match for her. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Neither side communicated with each other, and it wasn’t long before they reached the next fork in the path.

The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven all stopped in their tracks. With Shu Yarong as their leader, they would analyze the situation to determine the correct path. However, Ling Han and the others didn’t stop at all. They directly chose a path.

‘F*ck!’

Shu Yarong and the others were stunned. What in the world was going on? Didn’t they need to determine the correct path? This was impossible! To determine the correct path with a single glance? What kind of analysis ability was this?

“Follow them!” Shu Yarong immediately said. Even if this were the incorrect path, they could still immediately retreat. The memory of Celestials naturally didn’t need to be questioned.

They activated their movement techniques, and immediately followed behind Ling Han and the others.

After a day of travel, they arrived before another fork in the path.

With the eyesight of Celestials, they could easily determine how many paths there were with a single glance. Coincidentally, there was one more path than the previous fork.

In other words, this was the correct path!

Had Ling Han and the others guessed correctly?

Could there be such a great coincidence? Moreover, was it possible that they had guessed their way up to here?

This was far too terrifying! Just what kind of freak was he?

However, since this was the case, they would naturally follow behind Ling Han and the others.

The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven were all thinking this. After all, this would help them save some time.

After passing several forks, Shu Yarong and the others continued to follow behind Ling Han. They were enjoying the fruits of his labor.

“Oi, why are you still following us?” Hu Niu asked in displeasure.

“Does your family own these paths? Are others not allowed to walk them?” a monarch tier from the Wide Prosperity Heaven asked in retort. He naturally wasn’t willing to admit that they were enjoying the fruits of Ling Han’s labor.

“Alright then,” Ling Han said with a nod. After arriving at the next fork, he stopped and said, “You guys first.”

Shu Yarong and the others exchanged glances with each other. ‘Us first?’

However, they naturally didn’t need to back down. They ignored Ling Han and started to analyze the paths.

Ling Han snickered before choosing a path.

Upon seeing this, Shu Yarong and the others hurriedly followed after him. They didn’t feel any shame at all.

“You people are far too shameless!” Hu Niu shouted.

Ling Han smiled, and said to her, “Don’t worry, I’ve got this.”

Upon arriving at the next fork, Ling Han suddenly grabbed the Empress and the others before activating a movement technique. He surprisingly transformed into four shadows, each of which sprinted down a different path.

“Ah!” Shu Yarong and the others instantly stopped in their tracks. They didn’t know which shadow to follow.

How was this possible? Ling Han was only at the fifth severance, so even if his cultivation could rival those at the yang soul, and even if his battle prowess could suppress those at the yin soul, he still wasn’t a Dividing Soul Tier elite. Only those at the Dividing Soul Tier could separate their souls to create clones of themselves. It was impossible to tell these clones apart from the actual person.

This was far too strange.

However, they didn’t know that Ling Han had actually taken advantage of the power of time of the Black Tower. He had infused himself with this power, allowing time to slow down by several hundredfold. What looked like an instant to others was much more time for him. During this time, he had sprinted down four different paths. To others, however, it was as if he had suddenly summoned three clones of himself.

What could they do? Did they have to separate?

However, what if Ling Han did this again? If they divided the seven people up into four different groups, one group would only have a single person. That being the case, how could they split up again?

“Forget about it. Let’s analyze the paths ourselves.”

They started to wrack their own brains.

Ahead of them, Ling Han flashed a smile. ‘Trying to ride on my coattails?’

After walking for a dozen or so days, the path before them finally opened up. There were no more forks on the road, and there was only a wide and magnificent path. At the end of this path was a towering and majestic palace.

The four of them walked over, only to discover that this palace was only a shell of its former self. It was in complete disarray.

In the past, this had definitely been a spectacular structure. Its size was absolutely astonishing. Now, however, not even a single blade of grass could be found. All that was left was broken and naked stone. In a gigantic plaza, there rested a towering stone tablet. Engraved on it was a dense array of words.

Right now, a short man was standing before this stone tablet. His hair was white, and he wore an expression of slight concentration as he gazed up at the stone tablet.

However, he immediately turned around when Ling Han and the others arrived behind him. Was this not Tang Minglong?

He hadn’t gone to the mountain peak on the left, and he had instead directly come here.

If Ling Han had known that Tang Minglong had fought with Ji Wuming before, he could have guessed that he hadn’t gone to the mountain peak on the left because of Ji Wuming. Now, however, he couldn’t help but feel slightly curious. Why had Tang Minglong come here first?

One had to realize that the left mountain peak was the closest to the entrance. Even though the central mountain peak was in the center of the valley, it wasn’t actually facing the entrance directly.

“Who would’ve thought that you guys would arrive here first?” Tang Minglong said in emotion. He was well aware of Shu Yarong’s background. Yet, this reincarnated Celestial King had actually been surpassed by a few juniors. He couldn’t help but feel surprised.

Ling Han simply smiled in reply.

If others didn’t target him, he wouldn’t target them, either.

He walked over to observe the stone tablet.

“Heaven Destroying Nine Swords!”

Four words immediately surged over from the stone tablet. In fact, they transformed into four streaks of light—no, four bursts of Sword Qi—as they slashed down at Ling Han.

Boom!

Ling Han raised his arms to block.

Screech!

He was immediately pushed back by the overwhelming power of the Sword Qi.

Thud, thud, thud...

He retreated several hundred steps before finally coming to a stop.

At this distance, the words on the stone tablet instantly became blurry. He could only determine that there were words engraved into it.

“Heaven Destroying Nine Swords?” Ling Han murmured to himself as he stood there. A smile spread across his face, and he said, “So, this means that if I can’t stand closer to it, I don’t have the right to practice this sword technique?”
