Chapter 443: An Easy Victory

Translator: DarkAngel_ Editor: Kurisu

The spectators were all not very optimistic about Ling Han. Although he had ferocious power behind each single punch, the person he had killed was only in the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier and was not someone like Quick Sword Yang Qi who had a well-established reputation. Who knew how many Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators had been slashed by his blade?

“Yang Qi, kill him!”

“Don’t disappoint us!”

Some particularly fierce people among the spectators had already begun to call out wildly. The reason why they had spent a single Origin Crystal was precisely because they wanted to see a bloody battle.

Yang Qi was unmoved, and merely stared fixedly at Ling Han. He said, “You’re very strong. You’re qualified to make me battle with my full ability.”

“Oh, then are you qualified to make me attack at my full ability?” Ling Han asked, smiling. He truly hoped that there was someone in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier that could force him to the fullest of his ability; he currently felt a loneliness from standing at the very top and a solitude like snow.

“Watch my sword!” Yang Qi moved. Shua , at some moment, a sword had suddenly appeared in his hand. The blade was as thin as a cicada’s wing, and with a move of his wrist, the tip of the blade had appeared at Ling Han’s left shoulder. It was indeed shockingly fast.

“It’s too fast. He really deserves the name of Quick Sword Yang Qi!”

“It’s finished. Han Lin is going to be defeated by a single strike.”

The spectators called out in excitement. However, the fact that Yang Qi aimed for the Ling Han’s left shoulder rather than his heart made a large number disappointed. It would have been a greater spectacle if his stab killed him.

Ling Han smiled lightly, and with a grab of his right hand, his opponent’s thin sword had appeared in his hand.

Yang Qi’s expression changed drastically. His sword was already as fast as this, how had his opponent managed to grab it? He quickly drew back his sword, confident that the sharpness of his Snowy Wing Sword would be enough to inflict a serious injury to Ling Han’s hand.

Yet he immediately realized that it was as if Snowy Wing Sword had sprouted roots in Ling Han’s hand, and he couldn’t move it even the slightest bit.

Ling Han slowly raised his left fist.

Yang Qi was very clear that if he abandoned his sword and stepped back now, he could dodge this punch. But as a swordsman, he would live and die with his sword.

He did not abandon his sword, and merely continued to draw it back as hard as he could.

Unfortunately, even though he was in the sixth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, his strength was not as powerful as Ling Han’s, and no matter what he tried, he could not draw his sword out of the latter’s grasp. His eyes froze, and he decided to simply push the sword forward to pierce directly through Ling Han’s left shoulder.

But that was a pointless effort.

Yang Qi was still an expert swordsman, after all. With a loud shout, the tip of his blade actually formed seven flashes of Sword Qi that **** towards Ling Han.

With such a short distance between them, how was he supposed to dodge?

Ling Han smiled and made no attempt to dodge at all. He merely tilted his head at a slight angle and did not allow the Sword Qi to hit his eyes. Shua, shua, shua, shua. The seven flashes of Sword Qi landed solidly on him, but because he had now formed Body of Iron Sheet, the toughness of his physique was comparable to that of forging materials of the same level. The seven flashes of Sword Qi streaked over him, yet did not even leave behind a slight scratch.

Pu!

When they saw this scene, everyone choked. What kind of terrifying defense was that?

Sword Qi was formed from a combination of the martial artist’s personal strength, his comprehension of sword arts, and the medium. Yang Qi was in the sixth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, so there was no need to elaborate on his personal strength as he definitely had to be very strong. Furthermore, since he could form seven flashes of Sword Qi, his comprehension of sword arts was definitely not poor. Lastly, his Snowy Wing Sword was a Level Five Spirit Tool, and was definitely not a weak weapon.

But even with all these, he could not manage to leave a scratch on Ling Han at all! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“F***, is this guy still human?”

“This guy’s skin must be forged from precious metals, right? How could he be unmarred even with this kind of Sword Qi!?”

“This kind of defense is practically enough to make one lose all hope!”

“Who could manage to break through this kind of defense?”

The spectators outside the arena all exclaimed in shock. Some even had their hands cupped around their faces, showing expressions of absolute disbelief.

But not everyone was so. For example, Lu Yang, Zhu Xuan Er, and Yu Kun Lun all showed expressions of eagerness to battle. This kind of opponent was really worth fighting. They all had very high confidence in themselves and believed that they were all invincible when facing an opponent from the same cultivation level.

Ling Han shot out a fist, and with a peng , it landed on Yang Qi’s face, which instantly knocked him out. The latter had not born any killing intent, so he had pulled his punches.

“Han Lin wins!” the referee announced.

After defeating Yang Qi, although Ling Han had not managed to accumulate ten consecutive wins, it had already reached the time of one hour, and he had naturally obtained the qualification to enter the next round.

He descended the tournament stage and returned to the arena. He could clearly sense that there was a considerable number of heated gazes on him, which made him feel slight ache. This was not a physical pain, but rather a mental one. The battle intent of Yang Jun Hao and the others was too fierce.

Ling Han merely smiled calmly. Currently, who would be able to threaten him among the Spiritual Pedestal Tier?

...Unless the Sword Emperor or the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden appeared once more and returned to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, perhaps they would be qualified to fight him.

After all, he could be a monster, but so could the Sword Emperor and the others. The Heaven’s Sword Sect was an ancient great sect that had relations with the realm of gods. In his last life, only seven people managed to break through to the Heaven Tier, which showed how monstrous the Sword Emperor and the others were.

On the third day, Ling Han did not appear at the Great Arena. He did not need to know what kind of elite cultivators there were among his future opponents or observe their strongest moves. Anyways, whoever appeared in front of him, he only need to throw them out of the battle with a single punch.

Another day passed, and the semi-finals began.

A total of forty-nine people had qualified for the semi-finals. Thus, in the first round, there would be fifteen who would automatically pass to the second round, and the remaining thirty-four would have to fight to decide on who would be the final seventeen to qualify for the next round.

However, who would automatically pass was not decided by a drawing lots, but rather by the Jiang Clan. This was naturally unfair, but who asked them to be the organizer of this time’s Marriage Tournament and have the absolute power to decide?

As a result, the new and old first place holders of the Prodigy Roll like Yu Kun Lun, Yang Jun Hao, and Cao Tian Yi all passed without a doubt. It was the same for young geniuses like Ling Han and Lu Yang. Obviously, the Jiang Clan was optimistic about them and did not want them to be knocked out in the first round.

Unfortunately, the Jiang Clan only had one key. If not, they did have quite a number of young girls of marriageable age in their clan.

The first round ended, and the main namelist of thirty-two participants finally emerged. Though only men could participate in this Marriage Tournament, one look at this namelist and it was clear that this was definitely an even more awesome tournament than this time’s Prodigy Tournament.

There was a considerable number of generations of the top ten from the Prodigy Roll, and together with an extreme monster like Ling Han, there was another that had drawn public attention. Yet no one knew what he looked like.

That was because he wore a mask, but his build seemed to be quite small, and was obviously half a head shorter than the average person.

His name was Zhang Shan, which was obviously a false name.

Ling Han glanced him over, and was sure that the latter was in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier; he also faintly had an aura that Ling Han disliked.

The second round of battles began. Ling Han was the seventh to fight, and his opponent was the White-Robed Sword King, Shen Zhong Cheng.

The previous few battles quickly concluded because the organizer had tried their best to arrange it so that it would be a very powerful participant against a much weaker opponent. For the battle between Ling Han and Shen Zhong Cheng, did they think that Ling Han was at an absolute advantage, or at an absolute disadvantage?

Ling Han ascended the stage and nodded at Shen Zhong Cheng. He had a slightly favorable impression of this particular swordsman.

“Please!” Shen Zhong Cheng said seriously. He had seen Ling Han’s moves previously, and knew that the latter was very powerful.

Ling Han clasped his hands together and said, “Please!”

Shen Zhong Cheng drew his sword. Qiang , a brilliant sword flash soared to the heavens, and instantly, an additional seven flashes of Sword Qi appeared, which all swept towards Ling Han.

Ling Han did things simply and roughly. He faced the oncoming attack directly and raised his fist to deliver a series of fierce punches.

Peng, peng, peng. He merely shot out a consecutive seven punches and had not even circulated Fist Qi yet when the impact of his strike caused the long sword in Sheng Zhong Cheng’s hand to fly out of his grasp—and with that, he was defeated.
