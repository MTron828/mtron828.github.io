Chapter 1726: Arrival of King Tiers

Some time ago, in the Roc Palace in someplace in the Celestial Realm.

“Young Imperial Empress, Ling Han has already entered the Celestial Realm,” a woman reported to Hu Niu as she went down on one knee. There was a look of fervor on her face.

Their Imperial Empress had successfully advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier 100 or so years ago, and she had more so severed heaven and earth. She had become a king tier among king tiers. This was an achievement that few could rival, even among the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of the other powerful forces.

In reality, there was a notion of stronger or weaker even when it came to severing heaven and earth. One had to consider how thoroughly heaven and earth had been severed. The more thoroughly and viciously it was severed, the more powerful one would be.

Hu Niu was lazily lying down on a couch. She was a lazy person who definitely wouldn’t stand if she could sit, and definitely wouldn’t sit if she could lie down. Cultivating was truly torture for her, and if it weren’t for that old hag always watching her, she would have gone to look for Ling Han long ago.

Pa!

Hu Niu suddenly leaped up and laughed heartily, saying, “Where’s Niu’s Ling Han? Hurry, hurry, hurry, Niu is going to look for him!”

There was an expression of indignance on the woman’s face. Who was this Ling Han? Why was the Young Imperial Empress always thinking about him? In her eyes, the Young Imperial Empress was the most perfect person in the world. No man was worthy of her.

However, could she ignore the Young Imperial Empress’ question?

“Young Imperial Empress, we currently don’t know his whereabouts,” the woman hurriedly replied. “When opening the gate to the Celestial Realm, the point of entrance is largely random. Moreover, the Celestial Realm is also far too large. As such, it’s extremely difficult to determine his whereabouts.”

Hu Niu wore the vicious expression of a petulant child as she said, “Niu doesn’t care! Hurry up and find him! Niu wants to see Ling Han!”

“As you wish, Young Imperial Empress!”

It wasn’t long before 12 Dragonhawk teams flew out from the Roc Palace, each of which was led by an elite at the Immortal Palace Tier and consisted of 10 soldiers at the Dividing Soul Tier. They flew toward different regions in the Celestial Realm.

They only had a single task, and that was to find a certain man in the huge Celestial Realm.

Ling Han, the Empress, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden headed toward the Severing Mundane Pool, a Mystery Realm that was formed by heaven and earth. At normal times, the environment here was extremely harsh and unforgiving, resulting in no one being able to venture deep inside. If they tried to forcefully enter, they would be killed by the ferocious power of heaven and earth.

The Severing Mundane Pool would only open once every 10,000,000 years, and the meaning of “open” was that the power of heaven and earth inside would become largely manageable. As such, cultivators would be able to enter and venture into the depths of the Severing Mundane Pool.

There, they would be able to sense the mystical power of heaven and earth that was related to the Severing Mundane Tier. By comprehending it, they would then be able to sever a mundane or sever heaven and earth.

“If I’m not wrong, the Ding Clan, Han Clan, and Xiao Clan will all be waiting there for me,” Ling Han murmured as he stroked his chin. “Am I truly that reprehensible?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden instantly gave a silvery laugh. Her husband was indeed a top-notch elite when it came to causing trouble. He was only a Genesis Tier cultivator, yet he could already cause three-star forces to suffer defeat. Moreover, he could even retreat in one piece. This was truly an immensely difficult feat.

“Let’s keep a low profile.”

They were all dressed extremely conservatively, with not even their real appearances visible. Moreover, they also manipulated their aura such that even Severing Mundane Tier grand elders could only detect their presence if they stood extremely close.

Elites at the Dividing Soul Tier and Immortal Palace Tier could naturally observe a greater region, yet would such elites come to the Severing Mundane Pool? Perhaps Dividing Soul Tier elites might, but as for Immortal Palace Tier elites... Ling Han shook his head. This was the territory of a three-star force, so Immortal Palace Tier elites most likely wouldn’t venture here.

There was still a month or so until the Mystery Realm opened, yet far too many people had already gathered in the surrounding regions. Although these people all belonged to subordinate forces of the Fu Clan, there was still quite a lot of conflict between them. It was extremely common to witness battles between cultivators and even between Severing Mundane Tier grand elders.

“Xiao Sheng has arrived!” someone suddenly shouted in astonishment.

“Xiao Sheng? Who’s Xiao Sheng?” many people asked in confusion.

“What? You guys haven’t heard of Xiao Sheng? He defeated Changsun Liang two years ago!”

“Changsun Liang? The Black Moon Sect’s Changsun Liang? Gasp!”

It was impossible for news of Xiao Sheng’s victory over Changsun Liang to travel throughout the entire territory of the Fu Clan in just two years. Thus, this piece of news naturally astonished everyone.

Changsun Liang was well-renowned, and he was publicly acknowledged as a king tier of the younger generation. In fact, there was no one in the Fu Clan who could rival him. Yet, someone had actually defeated Changsun Liang? This instantly triggered a huge commotion.

“Could it be Hundred Magnificence City’s Xiao Clan?”

“Yes, it’s that Xiao Clan. How impressive! They produced a prodigy who’s even more powerful than Changsun Liang! They can definitely reach the Immortal Palace Tier in the future!”

“Heh, you guys don’t know, do you? Several prodigies have emerged these past few years, and Changsun Liang... is already a prodigy of the past!”

“Huh?”

“Indeed, the Desolate North has produced Song Ji, and Heaven Holding City has produced Ma Ying, both of whom can be regarded as king tiers. Most astonishingly, the Fu Clan has produced a supreme Divine Fetus!”

Everyone in the surroundings drew a sharp breath.

Even in the Celestial Realm, the words “Divine Fetus” couldn’t be thrown around lightly. This represented the most powerful physique in the world, a physique that would appear in fewer than one in one in one trillion people.

“Who is it?”

“Fu Xiaoyun. Not only does she possess a supreme Divine Fetus, but she’s also stunningly beautiful. Just a glance at her beauty can cause your soul to fly into the sky.”

“Is she also coming here to sever the mundane?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Of course! If she misses this opportunity, she’ll need to wait another 10,000,000 years. To young king tiers, 10,000,000 years is far too long. During this time, their opponents might have already become second severance grand elders!”

Ling Han was also slightly astonished upon hearing this. Another Divine Fetus had appeared.

There were two ways to develop a Divine Fetus. The first method was to be naturally born, and this depended on one’s parents and ancestors. According to rumors, one would have a larger probability of giving birth to a Divine Fetus if there existed a Celestial King among their ancestors. Otherwise, one would need to be extremely fortunate.

The second method was to cultivate some kind of special Celestial King Tier cultivation technique. An example of this was Gu Daoyi, who had accumulated his cultivation for 10 lifetimes before developing a Divine Fetus.

Anyhow, Ling Han was curious about how powerful the Fu Clan’s Divine Fetus was compared to the Empress.

Meanwhile, the Empress wore an expression of pride and haughtiness. She was confident that she could definitely win.

Ling Han gazed into the surroundings. He saw Xiao Sheng, who after nearly two years had naturally recovered from his wounds already. Although he had been severely wounded by Ling Han and the Empress at that time, the Xiao Clan had treated his wounds without any regard for the costs. He was to the Xiao Clan what Changsun Liang was to the Black Moon Sect.

Moreover, Xiao Sheng had already cleansed himself of the disappointment of losing to Ling Han that day. Moreover, he was now brimming with confidence after his victory over Changsun Liang. He viewed everyone else with disdain.

As a king tier, he was naturally proud and haughty.

Several days passed, and more and more king tiers arrived.

Song Ji—the king tier who had recently found fame in the Desolate North—was one of them. His battle prowess was terrifying, and many regarded him as invincible among those below the Severing Mundane Tier. Ma Ying was another of the king tiers. She was a precious daughter of Heaven Holding City, and she was also praised as invincible among those under the Severing Mundane Tier.

According to rumors, Song Ji and Ma Ying were also distant cousins. Thus, the two large clans that they belonged to were interested in connecting through their marriage. If this eventuated, they would most likely become the most powerful force under the rule of the Fu Clan. In fact, they might even develop the ability to challenge the rule of the Fu Clan in the future.

Apart from them, Fu Xiaoyun had also arrived. Moreover, she surprisingly hadn’t been accompanied by elites from the Fu Clan. She sat cross-legged on a mountain, and her appearance was so beautiful that it was enough to make one’s heart flutter. However, there was a sword resting on her lap, and she was radiating with a killing intent that warned others to stay away.

“Changsun Liang has arrived!” Another two days passed, and commotion swept through the sea of cultivators again. The cultivators were even more fervent than when Song Ji, Xiao Sheng, and Fu Xiaoyun had arrived. After all, this was a publicly acknowledged king tier.
