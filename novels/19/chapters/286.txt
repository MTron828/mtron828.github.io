Chapter 287: I am Ling Han

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Martial arts and alchemy were the same—they were about spending a long time to advance, aiming for the peak.

Moreover, alchemy had no way of speeding up the process.

There were spirit medicine and spirit fruits in the world—eating a stalk or a piece could increase cultivation and turn one into a formidable cultivator over night. However, there definitely wasn’t anything good like that that could make an alchemist’s techniques improve greatly in a matter of days.

Even with the Strange Fires’ existence that only allowed alchemists at lower tiers to refine higher tier medicinal pills, one still needed enough understanding of alchemy to do so; they couldn’t reach the sky in a single bound.

Ling Han wasn’t twenty, but he was already a medium level Black Grade alchemist?

This was definitely a joke; if such a genius ‘s name didn’t spread across the world, how could they have not heard of him?

“Hmph, I almost got deceived by you, you actually dare pose as an alchemist. How dare you!” Cheng Fei Jun said threateningly. His younger brother was captured and even had one of his arms severed earlier, making him extremely infuriated.

Ling Han laughed indifferently, pointed at his chest, and said, “Open your filthy eyes and look clearly, is this fake?”

F-filthy eyes?

Everyone’s mouth twitched, he actually dared to berate a high level Black Grade alchemist so; this guy was truly extremely daring.

“Youngster, hand over your alchemy master certification for inspection.” Qian Xing, one of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier warriors, spoke to Ling Han. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Badges might be faked, but alchemy master certifications not. On top was complete information, which could be investigated and verified immediately.

Cheng Fei Jun sneered, and said, “So what even if you are a medium level Black Grade alchemist, you still have to listen to my orders!”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk!” Ling Han wiggled his finger and said, “With which ear did you hear me say that I’m a medium level Black Grade alchemist? You’re an idiot as expected!” Ignoring Cheng Fei Jun who was already bursting with anger, he took out the third silver badge and placed in on his chest.

Three silver badges, the same as Cheng Fei Jun!

‘Impossible!’

Everyone said the same three words inside their minds. There definitely, definitely, definitely existed no such a young high level Black Grade alchemist.

“Ha!” Cheng Fei Jun sneered, already not believing from the point when Ling Han took out the second silver badge.

“Huh!?” Qian and Yang, the two formidable Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators, were startled momentarily, remembering someone all of a sudden.

“Bullsh!t, you think wearing three silver badges can make you pass as a high level Black Grade alchemist?” The one who boot-licked Cheng Fei Jun earlier immediately jumped out, pointing and shouting sharply at Ling Han.

Ling Han sighed and said, “Haven’t I mentioned that I hate it the most when others point at me?”

“Youngster, you’re surnamed Ling?” the Spiritual Pedestal Tier warrior surnamed Qian suddenly interjected.

“Ling!” Cheng Fei Jun’s expression immediately changed as he thought of someone. “Ling Han, you’re Ling Han!”

His expression was filled with rage.

Half a year ago, he advanced to high level Black Grade, creating the record in the Desolate North. A thirty year old high level Black Grade alchemist put in a large place like the north region was extraordinary, and very few could surpass him.

However, his complacency was only maintained for several months—very quickly, another young genius came out of nowhere, and became a high level Black Grade alchemist. Moreover, the genius was younger than him, so much younger that he couldn’t believe it.

Seventeen!

At first, even several people in the Star Brilliance Palace Hall had doubts about the truth of the matter, let alone him. However, with Fu Yuan Shen’s own handwritten letter and many medium level Black Grade alchemists’ joint guarantee, people could only believe it.

From that point on, Cheng Fei Jun hated Ling Han for stealing his glory; otherwise, he would’ve had the glory of being the youngest high level Black Grade alchemist, and how dazzling would that be?

This detestable guy stole his limelight, and today, he ran to his territory, injuring his younger brother and trampling over his face in public?

He definitely wouldn’t allow it!

“I am Ling Han.” Ling Han took out the crystal that could prove an alchemist’s status. Origin Power poured in and instantly formed a curtain of light that clearly wrote Ling Han’s alchemy master level, when and where he broke through, as well as the witnesses at the time.

Everyone cried out, because this happened only one or two months ago, and most people still didn’t know of Ling Han’s existence; they couldn’t help but stare blankly at Ling Han.

Too young, so young that people couldn’t accept it!

Cheng Fei Jun, a thirty year-old high level Black Grade alchemist, surprised people every time they saw him, sighing deeply for just how young he was, but what about Ling Han?

Seventeen? Eighteen?

My goodness!

“First, let go of my younger brother!” Cheng Fei Jun said, clenching his teeth.

Ling Han laughed lightly, and said, “You say let go and I do so, then what face do I have?

“Ling, Han!” Cheng Fei Jun’s eyes burst with flames. “What exactly do you want?

At this moment, Qian and Yang, the two Spiritual Pedstal Tier warriors, sat by and watched. Whether it was Ling Han or Cheng Fei Jun, both were high level Black Grade alchemists, they both had boundless prospects and were equal in status, so it wasn’t worthwhile for them to offend either one.

Ling Han laughed. “You finally asked about the main point. This guy has, well, obviously done countless terrible things, but I just arrived, so I’m not clear on just how terrible, nor do I have the effort to investigate. However, it’s the truth that this guy tried to kill me, yes, actually thinking of killing an alchemist. That’s death penalty, I’m not wrong, right?”

“Hmph, my younger brother didn’t know your status, this crime could be forgiven!” Cheng Fei Jun immediately said.

“You say it can be forgiven, so it’s forgiven? It’s not like you were the one who was threatened by this scum!” Ling Han ridiculed. “No need to trouble the Star Defense Force. This person conspired to kill an alchemist, I declare immediate execution!”

“You dare! You dare!” Cheng Fei Jun stamped his feet and said sternly, “Ling Han, you’re going to make an eternal enemy out of me?”

“Who the hell are you?” Ling Han scorned, his expression full of disdain.

“You, you dare insult me!” Cheng Fei Jun was stamped with fury, the veins on his neck twitching. “I won’t lower myself to your level. Hurry up and let go of my brother!”

Ling Han laughed loudly and said, “I discovered that you have quite the comical talent, but unfortunately, I don’t appreciate it at all.” He shook his hand, and instantly, a long sword appeared from thin air. As a high level Black Grade alchemist, he was already unafraid of people knowing of him having a “spatial ring.”

“Older brother, save me! Save me!” Cheng Kai Fu immediately felt Ling Han’s threatening killing intent and instantly waved his arms while screaming; however, his arm was jut reconnected, it couldn’t withstand such intense movement, so with a pa , the arm instantly fell from his shoulder, fresh blood gushing out profusely.

Pu , without hearing his cries in pain, Ling Han already struck, slicing open his neck.

Blood gurgled inside Cheng Kai Fu’s mouth as it spilled out violently, and he reached out towards Cheng Fei Jun, but his arm only rose halfway before drooping weakly to the ground.

“Brother!” Cheng Fei Jun shouted grimly, eyes bursting with flames. “Ling Han, I swear one of us will die!”

“Ha!” Ling Han shrugged indifferently and said, “I’ll make a bet that you’ll kneel properly before me later and call me Master Ling.”

“Bullsh!t” Cheng Fei Jun spat out—for him to be humiliated as he kneeled before the one who killed his brother? Impossible.

“How about it, want to bet? If you win, I’ll give you my Strange Fire, and conversely, you have to give your Strange Fire to me if I win.” Ling Han finally spoke of his true motive.
