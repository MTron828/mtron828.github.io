Chapter 1770: Might of the Divine Demon Sword

Fu Zhengtong refused to believe this; he didn’t dare to believe this.

This had shattered the iron rules of the cultivation world, and it was something that should have been completely impossible to achieve.

He had definitely made a mistake. His opponent was actually at the third severance... Yes, he was actually at the peak stage of the third severance!

“What a sneaky brat! You’re clearly at the third severance, yet you’ve purposefully practiced some cultivation technique to manipulate your aura and trick your opponents!” Fu Zhengtong said through clenched teeth. This kind of person was truly far too detestable. They didn’t focus on raising their cultivation, and they instead relied on these evil little trickeries.

Ling Han was astounded. Fu Zhengtong was far too skilled at speaking absolute bullsh*t!

“You’re nothing but a frog that sits at the bottom of a well,” Ling Han said. He couldn’t be bothered arguing with him anymore. He raised his fists and unleashed more of his battle prowess.

“Suppress!” Fu Zhengtong roared. He immediately composed himself. Their battle prowess was almost identical, so now it was a battle between whose celestial technique was more powerful.

As a member of the Fu Clan, how could he lose to this country bumpkin?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

They collided again, with both of them unleashing waves of celestial techniques. At the same time, Regulations transformed into spears and chains that whistled through the sky and shook the earth.

Fortunately, there were formations protecting the academy and its surroundings. As such, it would be extremely difficult to damage the surroundings. Even so, the surrounding earth was still filled with lumps and craters, making it look like a pockmarked face.

Ling Han had to admit that those at the fourth severance were indeed extremely powerful. Even though Fu Zhengtong was only at the early stage of the fourth severance, and even though he had only performed normal severances, he could still manage to rival Ling Han’s battle prowess.

Ling Han was sighing in emotion. However, if passers-by witnessed this battle, their eyes would definitely bulge out in disbelief.

‘You’re only at the f*cking second severance!’

Sure enough, because this was the entrance to the academy where people continued to enter and exit, it wasn’t long before people noticed the battle between Ling Han and Fu Zhengtong. They couldn’t help but walk over to spectate. Of course, some of them also noticed the Empress, and they couldn’t help but continue to glance over at her.

However, even the Empress’ stunning figure couldn’t hold their gazes for too long. This was because they discovered that Ling Han was only at the second severance.

This was far too astonishing. How could a cultivator at the second severance be so powerful? If he reached the fourth severance, then wouldn’t he be able to rival those at the Dividing Soul Tier?

They were so stunned that even the Empress’ charisma seemed weaker than normal. Of course, this was also because the Empress had concealed her true appearance. Otherwise, even the presence of a Celestial King Tier elite might not attract as much attention as her.

‘Fight, fight, fight!’

Ling Han unleashed his full power. Being weaker by two minor levels, he finally found an opponent he could battle against without restraint. Otherwise, even king tiers at the third severance would be comprehensively suppressed by him. Only those at the peak stage might be able to rival him.

He became increasingly enthusiastic. Meanwhile, Fu Zhengtong started to feel increasingly apprehensive. After all, Ling Han didn’t seem like he was at the third severance no matter how he looked at him...

A thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Had he been screwed over by Bei Xuanming?

Bei Xuanming hadn’t said that Ling Han had defeated him. Instead, he had only said that Ling Han had offended him, and that Ling Han was far too friendly with Fu Gaoyun. Upon hearing this, Young Master Hai had casually said that he would give Ling Han a lesson.

Now, however, who was giving whom a lesson?

Yet, their battle had already reached such a stage, so Fu Zhengtong naturally couldn’t give up and retreat. Instead, he definitely had to achieve victory. Otherwise, what face would he have?

He opened his mouth and spat out a miniature sword that started to expand in the air. This sword then eventually transformed into an azure blade three feet long that was engraved with snake-like patterns. Fu Zhengtong immediately imbued his Origin Power into the blade.

Weng!

The sword instantly lit up, releasing numerous projections of giant snakes that started to hiss at Ling Han.

“Defeat him!” Fu Zhengtong roared as he slashed his sword at Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

The giant snakes slithered through the air to attack Ling Han.

“You think only you have a Pseudo-Celestial Tool?” Ling Han asked. He immediately unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword. Coincidentally, he had just raised the toughness of this sword to the level of Two-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool. As such, now was a good time to test its might.

Weng!

The Divine Demon Sword shuddered slightly, yet it didn’t unleash any rays of brilliant light. In fact, not even symbols of the great dao materialized on the blade of the sword. At a glance, this looked like an incredibly ordinary sword.

In fact, Ling Han had already erased all of the Saintly patterns that had previously existed on the sword. After all, those Saintly patterns were nothing more than imperfections to the current Divine Demon Sword.

The Divine Demon Sword looked as ordinary as could be, yet when Ling Han slashed down, it released bursts of sword light that illuminated the sky. At the same time, countless bursts of Sword Qi surged forth, and it was as if they wanted to shatter the entire sky.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The projections of the giant snakes were immediately obliterated by the countless bursts of Sword Qi. However, the bursts of Sword Qi didn’t dissipate, and they instead continued to slash at the nearby Fu Zhengtong.

“What?!” Fu Zhengtong was completely astounded. He had retrieved his Pseudo-Celestial Tool to settle victory and defeat in one resolute attack, yet who would have thought that the country bumpkin would also retrieve a Pseudo-Celestial Tool? Moreover, Ling Han’s Pseudo-Celestial Tool was even more powerful than his!

He frantically shot back in retreat. The bursts of Sword Qi from the Divine Demon Sword were far too terrifying. In fact, they were powerful enough to easily slice through his flesh. Although they weren’t powerful enough to kill him, who would want to suffer severe wounds for no good reason?

Just then, they had still been evenly matched. However, with the addition of the Divine Demon Sword, the battle instantly started to become one-sided.

In just a dozen or so exchanges, Fu Zhengtong was severely wounded by Sword Qi, with blood gushing from his wounds.

Being cut by the Divine Demon Sword was definitely no joke.

Moreover, Fu Zhengtong had only been cut by the Sword Qi. If he had been cut by the actual Divine Demon Sword, he would have been dead already.

Fu Zhengtong retreated for at least 50 kilometers before coming to a stop. Meanwhile, he continued to stare at Ling Han who was still standing in the distance. At this moment, he had truly lost all face. He had initially wanted to teach Ling Han a lesson, yet it was now him who was being taught a lesson. Moreover, this had been witnessed by countless people. If word of this got back to Young Master Hai, perhaps he would even be scolded and fall out of favor.

After all, Young Master Hai didn’t need trash!

However, should he continue to fight against Ling Han? Forget about it; he didn’t want to get pummeled!

Meanwhile, the spectators were all engaged in spirited discussions before the gate of the academy. They didn’t know who Ling Han was, so they were all speculating about his background.

“Lord Mao!” Ling Han said in greeting and nodded at Mao Dai.

Mao Dai sighed with emotion. Back then, he had even wanted to take Ling Han as his disciple. Now, however, Ling Han’s cultivation level was only a single severance lower than his. In terms of battle prowess, Ling Han had more so surpassed him by a significant amount.

He could barely accept this reality. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t call me lord anymore. I’m not the commander of the Dark Moon Army anymore, and your battle prowess is also superior to mine,” Mao Dai said with a serious expression. When cultivators communicated with each other, strength was of utmost importance. Thus, Mao Dao felt extremely uncomfortable when Ling Han referred to him using such an unfitting title.

Ling Han didn’t insist anymore, and he said, “Then I’ll call you Brother Mao.”

Mao Dai nodded upon hearing this. However, just as he was about to enter the academy with Ling Han, he suddenly saw someone walking out. This person was none other than Fu Gaoyun.

“Brother Ling, I heard that you got into a fight?” Fu Gaoyun looked around, and he asked, “Where’s your opponent? Where are they?”

“The fight’s over,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

“Over so quickly? I wasn’t even able to enjoy the show. Oh, that’s right, you’re far too good at causing trouble. How did you get into a fight on your first day at the academy?” Fu Gaoyun asked teasingly.

Ling Han rolled his eyes, and replied, “Isn’t this all thanks to you? Anyway, how many potential successors does the Fu Clan have?”

“Why are you suddenly asking this?” Fu Gaoyun asked in slight curiosity.

“The person I was fighting with just then was called Fu Zhengtong. He said that Young Master Hai or something wanted to teach me a lesson. He also told me not to be friends with a weak person like you anymore.”

“What?!” Fu Gaoyun exclaimed in astonishment. “You were fighting with Fu Zhengtong?”

Heavens! That was a fourth severance elite!
