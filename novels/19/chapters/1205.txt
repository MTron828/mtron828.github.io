Chapter 1206: Speaking Without Bounds

‘What?!’

Zhu Tianchou and Yu Si almost jumped up in astonishment. Ling Han was only bait?

Why were they targeting and chasing Ling Han?

Although he had offended and disobeyed Gao Huang, this wasn’t enough reason for the Gao Faction to spend so much effort targeting him. The most important reason was the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid. However, he had actually handed these to the Mo Clan Establishment to auction!

That being the case, what did it matter whether they captured Ling Han or not?

They had been screwed over!

“You look like you’ve eaten dead children,” Ling Han said with a chuckle. “You have to understand that the Thousand Source True Fluid was mine to begin with. Yet, you people are so worried about it now. Heh, should I thank you guys?” His voice was full of ridicule.

He had handed the Thousand Source True Fluid and other auction items to Ding Ping before he went into seclusion. Moreover, he had correctly guessed that the Gao Faction would monitor the people close to him. Thus, he had used himself as bait to draw all of them over.

It was only natural that they fell for his trick. Ling Han—their main target—had appeared, so shouldn’t they pursue him?

“You must be lying!” Zhu Tianchou roared. He had already been screwed over by Ling Han once. If he was screwed over again, he wouldn’t be able to raise his head anymore. It would be far too humiliating.

“That’s right, you’re definitely trying to scare us into hurrying back,” Yu Si said. “That way, you’ll be able to escape!”

Ling Han shrugged his shoulders, and said, “Heh, only losers will stubbornly believe that they haven’t lost yet! Alright, it’s time to leave. It’s about time that this farce came to an end. I don’t want to carry a nonexistent accusation, even if it’s only a suspicion!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Zhu Tianchou and Yu Si exchanged a glance. It was already too late to return to the Mo Clan Establishment. Their only option was to capture Ling Han and bring him back. That way, they would have at least accomplished their task.

After a short while, they arrived at the White Jade Palace, which was located on the main peak. This palace was cut from flawless white jade.

This was where the sect interrogated people and determined their innocence or guilt.

After learning of Ling Han’s “return”, several elites instantly hurried over. They would act as judges.

There were five elites in total, and they were all at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier.

Heavenly Body Tier elites naturally wouldn’t come to interrogate a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator. After all, who had so much spare time? If this was the case for Heavenly Body Tier elites, then it was obviously more so the case for Eternal River Tier elites. Venerable Trinity spent almost all of his time cultivating. He barely ever came out of seclusion.

However, were elites at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier not enough? Apart from the one Eternal River Tier elite and 24 Heavenly Body Tier elites, this was the most powerful force of the Majestic Heaven Sect. This was a force to be reckoned with, even when casting one’s eyes over the entire galaxy.

“Han Ling, are you not going to kneel before us?” one of the judges roared.

He was called Shen Kuo, and he was the head of the five judges. Thus, he was naturally seated in the middle.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “This disciple hasn’t broken any sect rules, so what am I being accused of? Moreover, I’m a seed, so I don’t have to kneel before you, am I correct? Heh, my respects to you, Seniors.”

He clasped his hands in front of him and nodded at the five judges. This was his “respectful” greeting.

“What an arrogant brat!” another judge—Ma Gai—exclaimed. His eyes were very narrow, and there was a strangely feminine feel about him. “Youth, that which is too hard snaps easily. Those who are too arrogant never meet with good fate.”

“Oh, are you talking about Yang Hao?” Ling Han chuckled, and said, “He’s indeed very arrogant. He’s already at the Sun Moon Tier, yet he’s still targeting cultivators at the Mountain River Tier. He’s ignoring the rules of the sect, yet he actually went unpunished even after causing such a great commotion. There’s truly no justice.”

Pu!

The five judges almost exploded in rage. ‘You’re pretty f*cking good at spewing sh*t, aren’t you?!’

Yang Hao was indeed very arrogant. However, he was a one-in-1,000,000-years prodigy. In fact, there was even a chance that Venerable Trinity would choose him as his successor. Thus, he had the right to be arrogant. Moreover, hadn’t Yang Hao been severely beaten by the empress already? Even his life essence had started to drain, and his lifespan had decreased by at least several hundred years.

Although a few hundred years wasn’t significant to Heavenly Body Tier elites, it wasn’t insignificant, either. When they neared the end of their lifespan, even a period of a few hours would be extremely precious, let alone a period of several hundred years.

Yang Hao hadn’t caused a fuss after suffering this fate, yet Ling Han was standing here and taking jabs? Where was the justice?

Shen Kuo coughed loudly, and said, “Han Lin, stop trying to deride others!”

The aim of this trial was to determine whether Ling Han was innocent or guilty. So, what reason was there to talk about others? His expression became cold, and he asked, “Do you understand your crime?”

“Understand what crime?” Ling Han retorted with a smile.

“During your time in the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm, you slaughtered the Gao Faction’s Shi Ming as well as his companions. Not only that, but you even stole their Thousand Source True Fluid!” Shen Kuo’s voice was frosty, and he even unleashed his Sun Moon Tier aura toward Ling Han.

Unfortunately for him, Ling Han’s divine sense was extremely sturdy and tough thanks to the tempering from the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Moreover, he had even refined a remnant wisp of Demonic Power Source. Thus, if one wanted to suppress his divine sense, they would need to be at least Genesis Tier elites.

As for Sun Moon Tier elites? They weren’t powerful enough!

Ling Han stood proudly, and said, “What Gao Faction? I’ve never seen it before! In fact, I’ve never even heard of it!”

“Utter drivel!” Ma Gai humphed, and said, “If you don’t have a guilty conscience, why did you disappear for several months and make it impossible for others to find you?”

“You truly like to joke. Isn’t it extremely normal for cultivators to cultivate in seclusion?” Ling Han smiled, and continued, “Perhaps you make a special report to the sect before you go into seclusion?”

Ma Gai was instantly rendered speechless. Of course disciples could go into seclusion as they pleased. However, the timing of Ling Han’s seclusion was far too coincidental to be an accident. No matter how one looked at it, it was clearly the action of a criminal escaping prosecution!

Shen Kuo waved his hand, and said, “This is a fair and just trial to determine whether you’re guilty or innocent. So, we still haven’t used any instruments of torture on you yet. The sect definitely won’t torture you into making a false admission. However, we won’t allow criminals to lie their way out, either!”

“Senior is so just!” Ling Han exclaimed with a smile. However, there was strong flavor of sarcasm in his voice.

Shen Kuo really wanted to slap him to death. However, he could only suppress his urge upon thinking of Ling Han’s identity as a seed. Anyhow, were it not for the fact that Ling Han had come from a small world and didn’t have any background, how would they dare to target a seed?

Which seed didn’t have the support of Heavenly Body Tier elites?

The situation surrounding Ling Han, the Rain Emperor, and Ding Ping was extremely unique. Three seed-level geniuses had actually come from the same small world!

Shen Kuo composed himself, and said, “You’re innocent for the time being. However, there’s still a dispute regarding which party the Thousand Source True Fluid belongs to. So, I’ll have to ask you to hand over the Thousand Source True Fluid first. If it truly belongs to you, we’ll naturally return it later.”

After saying so much, their true aim was still the Thousand Source True Fluid.

This was to be expected. If it were Ling Han alone, the Gao Faction definitely wouldn’t spend so much effort and resources.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Senior, are you trying to say that the Thousand Source True Fluid was obtained by that Crap Faction or whatever? Heh, you’re quite the joker. How could those weaklings have obtained the Thousand Source True Fluid? Four drops, no less!

“Oh, that’s right. I heard that Yang Hao also obtained two drops before. If that Crap Faction obtained four drops, doesn’t that mean that they’re even more powerful than Yang Hao?”

‘W-weaklings?’

Shen Kuo and the other judges all winced upon hearing this. In reality, they were all members of the Gao Faction. Although Ling Han hadn’t called any names, he had effectively called all of them weaklings in his sweeping statement. He was a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator, yet he had pointed at their noses and called them weaklings? How could they accept this?!

‘What a toxic brat!’
