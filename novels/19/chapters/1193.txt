The aura-formed person was a little irritated. He was more so unable to accept this.

There were seven people, yet not a single one of them was willing to acknowledge him as master. Did they all think that they were Genesis Tier Saints?

“Since none of you are willing to acknowledge me as master, the secret techniques of this palace will have nothing else to do with you seven,” he said emotionlessly. He paused for a moment, and then gazed at the seven king tiers. A smug look appeared on his face when he saw the corners of their eyes twitch.

He didn’t believe that these youths could maintain their composure and resist the temptation of the secret techniques.

“However, these secret techniques are useless to me, so it’s not as if I can’t bestow them to you seven,” the aura-formed person continued. He paused and looked at them again. He always stopped at the critical points.

Ling Han was the first to react, saying, “It looks like Senior has some conditions.”

The aura-formed person smiled, and said, “They’re not conditions per se. I passed away long ago, and what’s left of me right now is only a wisp of my willpower. As such, I can’t collect those secret techniques even if I want to. So, I need one of you to act as a host for my willpower. That way, I’ll be able to retrieve those secret techniques.

“If anyone wants those secret techniques, let me borrow their body for a moment. Otherwise, there’s absolutely nothing I can do!”

Solemn expressions appeared on Ling Han and the other’s faces when they heard this.

Was he trying to possess them?

He had made it sound enticing, saying that he was only borrowing someone’s body to retrieve those light orbs. However, what if he didn’t leave their body? Moreover, he claimed that he had already passed away, and said that only a wisp of his willpower was remaining. However, who could guarantee that this was true?

What if this was a damaged soul? If that were the case, letting him enter their body would be suicide.

“Who wants these secret techniques?” the aura-formed person asked. His voice was dripping with temptation.

Ling Han and the others remained silent, and they all entered a defensive stance. Although this aura-formed person wore a facade of politeness, who knew whether he would flip out in rage after being rejected?

“No one?” the aura-formed person asked. He sighed upon seeing that no one was going to answer him. “I had initially wanted to use a simpler method. By the looks of it, I can only use the more difficult method now!”

He swept his gaze over them, then pointed at Ling Han, and said, “Your body is the most suitable for me. I’ve never seen such a powerful physique before. In fact, no one in history has been able to reach such a level in the Mountain River Tier! However, your divine sense is also incredibly tough. I’m not confident that I can erase it.”

“Thank you for your praise, Senior. However, it seems like you’re a little short-sighted. The world is enormous, so who knows whether there are other supreme prodigies?” Ling Han said calmly.

This aura-formed person had tried to use words before resorting to force. He had used secret techniques to entice them, and was only turning to force after realizing that no one would bite his bait.

That being the case, Ling Han didn’t need to be polite, either. Anyhow, the aura-formed person had tried to persuade them with words first, so what did that signify?

This hinted at the fact that he no longer possessed his Eternal River Tier strength. Otherwise, why would he need to tempt Mountain River Tier cultivators?

The aura-formed person didn’t become angry. He simply shook his head, and said, “I traveled the world for countless years, so what prodigies haven’t I seen? Hehe!” He turned his attention to Shen Zhu’er, and said, “I can sense a powerful bloodline in this young lady’s body. Shame, what a shame! Her divine sense is protected by a secret technique, and I’m not powerful enough to challenge it at this moment.”

He went through the seven king tiers, listing out all of their strengths. Ling Han and the others were all astounded. His vision was incredible, and he had been spot on with everything that he had said.

In the end, the aura-formed person pointed at Wu Zhe, and said, “You’re the weakest of the seven. Relatively speaking, you’re also the least talented. You’re not the best host for my soul, but you’re definitely the easiest to possess. So, I won’t be too fussy.”

As he spoke, he formed into a streak of light that shot toward Wu Zhe’s body.

Wu Zhe was naturally prepared, and he hurriedly crossed his arms, raising his power to the extreme. Close to 90 divine patterns appeared around his body. Since he didn’t know what this aura-formed person was, he took a more conservative approach just in case. Right now, the most important thing was to protect himself.

Divine patterns flashed through the air. These were the Regulations of heaven and earth, and they represented the might of the pinnacle level.

However, they were utterly useless against the uncanny aura-formed person. The streak of light pierced through Wu Zhe’s defenses and shot into his mouth.

“Aaah...!” Wu Zhe instantly wailed in agony. His arms and legs spread wide open, and his head was forcefully thrown back. The black aura surged into his mouth, forming a misty cloud around his head. It appeared extremely uncanny.

“Humph!” Ling Han and the others naturally wouldn’t stand aside and watch. They all retrieved their God Tools and slashed at the black aura.

“Kakaka! You want to wound me with such measly power? You’re several epochs too young!” The unbridled laugh of the black aura cut straight into their minds. This was voice transmission through the divine sense.

Regardless of how the six king tiers attacked the black aura, it simply shifted in shape and size. They were completely unable to wound this mysterious being. Meanwhile, the black aura continued to surge into Wu Zhe’s body, causing his stomach to expand at a rate that was visible to the naked eye.

Before long, Wu Zhe’s stomach had already expanded to the size of a wok. It was as if he had become morbidly obese. There was an agonized look on his face, and the veins on his face were all popping out. His eyes also looked like they were about to pop out of his head.

The shape of his face also continued to shift. He was himself at times, though his face would become that of another person at other times. It was extremely eerie.

Xiu!

The last wisp of black aura crept into Wu Zhe’s mouth at this moment, and his stomach suddenly shrunk back to its original size. It was as if they had been seeing things just then.

There was a dazed look on Wu Zhe’s face as he stared at Ling Han and the others, and he was just about to raise his arm and say something. However, he suddenly grabbed his head and began to wail in agony.

A devastating aura exploded from his body. It was eerie, sinister, and filled with an air of death.

It felt just like the Yellow Spring in the sky outside!

“Damn it! He’s about to be possessed!”

“Once that person succeeds, his strength might increase by an explosive amount!”

Ling Han and the others all cried out in alarm.

Possessions were actually very rare—ordinarily speaking, what elite would abandon their own body to take over another person’s body?

Possession meant that one would have to forsake their own cultivation. Moreover, when the Regulations of heaven and earth determined one’s lifespan, they would do so based on the divine sense of the person. Thus, an old and near-death cultivator wouldn’t gain the lifespan of a younger cultivator even if they possessed their body.

However, if this mysterious being successfully possessed Wu Zhe’s body, there was a great possibility that he would gain the strength of an Eternal River Tier elite. As such, his battle prowess would see a terrifying increase.

“Kill him!” Wu Wentong said resolutely.

With Wu Zhe’s strength, there was no way that he could resist the possession of the mysterious being. That being the case, it would also be impossible for them to drag the divine sense out of his body. Thus, their only option was to kill Wu Zhe before the possession of his body was complete.

“Kill him!” Shen Zhu’er said with a nod.

Disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect weren’t allowed to kill each other. However, that depended on the situation. Right now, Wu Zhe already wasn’t Wu Zhe. Instead, he was in the process of becoming a terrifying demon.

They had to kill him in the cradle!

The six king tiers charged toward Wu Zhe in unison.
