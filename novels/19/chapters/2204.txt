Chapter 2205: In front of the academy gates

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Saintly Origin Academy had been co-founded by 22 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so its status was naturally astonishingly high, even more amazing than the greatest sects in the world.

You wanted to enter into the gates of the academy? It was difficult.

…Who did not want to enroll into the Saintly Origin Academy? But the threshold for enrollment was too high.

Ling Han, the Rain Emperor, Hu Niu, and the Empress stood side by side, standing at the gates of the academy.

They were just four people, yet seemed like four great rulers, capable of causing an endless stir in the atmosphere.

However, Hu Niu was too unreliable. She had already taken out a chicken drumstick to chew on, and the image was immediately destroyed without leaving anything behind, completely becoming a comical scene.

“Who are these four idiots?”

“Do they think that just standing at the academy gates, they can consider themselves disciples of the academy?”

“Haha, where did these four jokers come from?”

Students came in and out, and when they saw Ling Han and his group, they immediately erupted into discussions, feeling that these four people were really too funny.

A man approached, asking Hu Niu and the Empress, “Beauties, become my followers, and I will take the two of you in, how about it?”

“Scram, or Niu will beat you to burst!” As Hu Niu chewed on her chicken drumstick, she issued a threat to the man.

“Yo, our popular lover boy has been rebuffed!” Another man walked over. This was a man dressed in a green shirt, having a lanky build, his aura majestic.

The first man turned, glanced at the man in the green shirt, frowned, and said, “Jia Xi, there is no need for your interference!”

“Have I spoken wrongly, Cheng Liang?” the man in the green shirt, Jia Xi, stated calmly.

The first man’s name was Cheng Liang, and he was a well-known playboy. Furthermore, he did indeed have his ways with women. A great many women whose cultivation levels were higher and stronger than his had all willingly become his lovers.

When he spotted the Empress and Hu Niu, he had gained some intentions, and that was why he had immediately approached. Being rejected by Hu Niu was naturally within his expectations as well—no matter how charismatic he was, he had not reached the point that others would be falling in love with him at first sight.

However, he would first strike up a conversation, get familiar, and next he would shamelessly pursue them, slowly unfolding his charisma little by little, completely winning the hearts of these two beauties.

As for Jia Xi, he, too, was a playboy. That was why he knew that the former would be undermining his plans when he emerged, and his goal would also be these two exquisite beauties.

“Jia Xi, are you planning to become my enemy?” he asked menacingly.

Jia Xi chuckled coldly. He was indeed no match for Cheng Liang, but now it was a fight over women, and the most important factor here was their skills, not their battle prowess. He said, “What is it? Are you now furious after being humiliated because I hit the nail on the head?”

“You’re seeking death!” Cheng Liang raised his hand, wanting to deliver a strike on Jia Xi.

Ling Han stretched out a leg, and with a light hook, peng, Cheng Liang’s whole person stumbled onto the ground, landing solidly.

When Jia Xi saw this, he couldn’t help but laugh loudly, but as he laughed, the smile on his face gradually disappeared.

Which of those that were capable of enrolling into the Saintly Origin Academy was mediocre?

Both he and Cheng Liang were emperor tiers, and could be considered above average even among emperor tiers. However, Cheng Liang tripped with just a hook of the leg from Ling Han. Just what kind of overwhelming strength was that? If he had previously leaked just a bit of covetous intentions towards the two women, would he also have been struck a blow?

Cheng Liang was completely dizzy from his stumble, and only climbed to his feet after a long while. He looked towards Ling Han, initially with a dazed expression on his face, which then became anger. “You, you dare to make a move on me?”

He was a disciple of Saintly Origin Academy!

“Your only support is your higher cultivation level!” His expression was filled with contempt. The moment Ling Han moved, he could sense that the former should be a Heaven Soul, and he was only a Yin Soul. Though he was an emperor tier, he could only be invincible against Earth Souls at most. Against a Heaven Soul, he could barely last a few moves, but would definitely be outmatched.

How shameless. His cultivation level was higher than his, yet still launched a sneak attack? What was the meaning of that?

The students in the area all nodded. With their insight, they could naturally distinguish Ling Han’s cultivation level. He was indeed a Heaven Soul.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “You dare to have unsightly designs on my wife, and are rebuking me for having a higher cultivation level?”

Pu, a considerable number of people immediately spluttered out in laughter. It was indeed Cheng Liang who had taken the initiative to approach and ask for a beating.

To make a slightly unsuitable analogy, if someone were to harass your wife, how could it be that you would check to see if the other was your equal in strength before deciding to make a move?

How could that be!

Cheng Liang was struck speechless for the moment. Pointing at Ling Han, he declared, “All right. If you have the guts, don’t run!” He turned and ran into the academy gates. As a member of the academy, he would naturally not be obstructed. Very quickly, he disappeared from sight.

There were no guards at the gates, but there was naturally a Celestial King Tier formation channeling, which was more useful than any kind of guards.

“I say, brother, you had best run!” someone called out towards Ling Han.

“What for?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“Though Cheng Liang is weaker than you, not only is his older brother also an emperor tier, he is also a Heaven Soul!” that person said. “You did not manage to enroll into the academy, and that means that you are at most only a Heaven Soul emperor tier, and belong to the category with strength that is weaker. There is no way you would be a match for Cheng Qi.”

Cheng Qi was Cheng Liang’s older brother. To have two emperor tiers emerge from the same clan was very extraordinary.

Being capable of enrolling into Saintly Origin Academy had now become the standard for assessing whether one was a prodigy or not.

“Brother, don’t cower. Isn’t it just Cheng Qi? There’s only one thing to do, and that’s fight!” Yet some deliberately egged him on, eager to watch the excitement.

There were many of such people at that, and they cheered from the sidelines, cheering Ling Han on, and yelling in encouragement.

Ling Han naturally would not be leaving. He merely smiled in response.

Enrolling into the Saintly Origin Academy was actually very simple. One only had to prove that he possessed a strong natural talent in cultivation, or was an expert in a particular field. Thus, Ling Han and his group only had to get into a fight here, beating all their opponents into submission, and they naturally would be able to become a member of the academy.

Fighting was a method that he preferred.

Only a while later, Cheng Liang appeared again, with a man of short stature beside him. However, this man had an astonishing aura, as if there was a giant dragon coiled up within his body.

So this short man was Cheng Qi?

Yi, the two brothers really had very different appearances.

Cheng Qi and his brother walked out of the gates, and both stopped in front of Ling Han.

“To dare make a move on my younger brother, you are really quite bold,” Cheng Qi stated coldly, his gaze not even falling on the Empress and Hu Niu. Instead, his stare was fixed on Ling Han and the Rain Emperor.

It seemed like that not only did these two brothers have largely differing appearances, their personalities were also extremely different.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “So-so, just second in the world.”

“Humph, what I hate the most is when others speak cheekily in front of me.” Cheng Qi’s face was still icy-cold.

“Yi, don’t you know how to laugh?” Hu Niu asked curiously.

Cheng Qi immediately looked angered. “I have already said that I despise it when others speak cheekily in front of me!”

“You really won’t laugh?” Hu Niu was really curious, and couldn’t help but ask again.

“Cheeky mouth!” Cheng Qi couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He stretched out his right hand, which turned into a golden millstone that descended down on Hu Niu.

Hu Niu was intrigued now. Puffing up her cheeks, hu, she blew out a breath, and the golden millstone was immediately sent flying backwards through the skies. In an instant, it disappeared without a trace. She was curious, and came closer to ask again. “Have you never laughed?”

Cheng Qi did not panic. He stretched out his arms, and boom, gold spread out, turning everything in the surrounding area into metal.

“Why can’t you laugh?” Hu Niu’s eyes widened.. She was completely unscathed.
