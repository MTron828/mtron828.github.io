Chapter 1526 New Shopkeeper

The Saint that had set off was the Dīpankara Saint.

He arrived in no time, and he quickly returned with the guards who had been knocked unconscious. However, these guards were unable to recall whom they were knocked unconscious by, regardless of how hard they racked their brains.

The Star Sand Saint was furious upon learning of this. The mysterious culprit was most likely the same person who was responsible for Gu Daoyi’s disappearance. Yet, they had actually dared to lay a trap there! How incredibly audacious! This was a direct provocation to his might!

However, what did it matter that he was furious? There were no clues for him to chase, so what more could he do?

Ling Han safely returned to the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. He then headed to the Treasure Forest Pavilion to check how much Godly metal Lin Yuqi had obtained for him.

However, Ling Han was given a fright when he arrived before the pharmacy. It was bustling with people.

The last time he had come, it had been desolate and quiet. Now, however? There was an endless stream of people entering and leaving the pharmacy. It was as if they wanted to burst the pharmacy apart.

“Brother Qian, are you for real? I want to forge a treasured saber, so why are you taking me to a pharmacy?”

“Hehe, you’ll know once we go inside.”

Two people in front of Ling Han were about to head into the pharmacy. However, one of them was wearing a confused expression as they looked at the sign of the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

A pharmacy selling weapons? How strange!

Ling Han entered the pharmacy behind the two people. Upon entering, he discovered that only a small portion of people was actually purchasing medicines. Most people were gazing around as if waiting for something to happen.

It wasn’t long before a maid in an azure dress appeared, a tray in her hand. There was an item on this tray, yet it was hidden by a red cloth.

“Let us begin the auction for today’s Godly metal!” The maid removed the red cloth, revealing the dazzling piece of metal that rested beneath it.

“Gasp! This is a Level 14 Godly metal, the Ghost-patterned Gold!”

“It can be forged into a Level 14 weapon, and after being nurtured for a long time, it can become a Level 14 God Tool! Its power is on par with elites at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier!”

“I’ve always heard that this pharmacy auctions a piece of high-level Godly metal every three days. I hadn’t believed it before, but I have no option but to believe it now. This is truly astonishing!”

“Indeed! A pharmacy is actually selling Godly metal! How strange is this?”

“Aren’t they stealing business from actual weapons shops?”

Everyone was engaged in a spirited discussion. However, they would still place a bid if they thought the price was right. After all, what did it matter where they purchased their Godly metal from? Everything would be fine as long as the Godly metal was real.

Bids were placed one after another, and the piece of Level 14 Godly metal was eventually sold to a very happy customer. The customer excitedly handed over his payment before immediately stowing the Godly metal away. He then sprinted away from the pharmacy, afraid that he would be ambushed and robbed.

Although the auction had already concluded, many people still lingered around. They had come here anyway, so they might as well purchase some goods.

Even if only one percent of the people purchased goods, this would still be a huge amount of transactions. After all, there were far too many people here.

Ling Han nodded upon seeing this. He then approached a worker, and said, “Where’s the shopkeeper? I have some matters to discuss with them.”

“Who are you? Do you think any random person can meet our shopkeeper?” The worker was unexpectedly arrogant, and his attitude was the complete opposite of what Ling Han had experienced the previous time he had come here. Moreover, the workers here were all different from before. Ling Han didn’t recognize a single one of them.

Business was booming right now, so Ling Han could understand the overconfidence of these workers. However, their arrogance and haughty attitude were taking things a step too far.

Ling Han’s expression became cold, and wisps of heaven’s might started to emanate from his body. The worker almost wet his pants in fright. “Don’t make me repeat myself again. Call your shopkeeper over.”

The worker hurriedly nodded, and replied, “Yes, yes, right away!” His entire body was trembling.

After waiting for a moment, Ling Han saw the worker reappear. “Sir, I’m extremely sorry. The shopkeeper is busy at the moment, so he has no time to entertain guests.”

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han’s gaze became intense, and it was as if he were about to explode with fury. However, he forcefully suppressed his anger, and said, “Tell him that Ling Han has come.”

The worker hesitated for a moment. He had been told to ignore this customer and directly shoo them out of the pharmacy. However, the question was: did he dare to shoo this customer away? Moreover, did he have the ability to shoo this customer away?

Thus, he had no option but to turn around and report to the shopkeeper again.

He returned after a moment, saying, “Mr. Ling, the shopkeeper has invited you for a discussion.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He led Ling Han to the backyard of the pharmacy.

There was indeed a person standing in the backyard, but this person wasn’t Lin Yuqi. Instead, it was a middle-aged man. He looked like a large mountain, and there was a powerful aura radiating from his body.

He was at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

‘Where’s Lin Yuqi?’

Ling Han knew that something wasn’t right, and he asked, “Where’s Lin Yuqi?”

The middle-aged man waved the worker away before calmly saying, “I’m Shi Gangyang, the new shopkeeper of this pharmacy.”

Ling Han frowned, and said, “I handed Lin Yuqi a large amount of Godly metal to help sell for me...”

“Ahem!” Shi Gangyang coughed loudly, and said, “Lin Yuqi has already been transferred back to the headquarters. I don’t know what kind of deal you made with her, and I can’t take your word for it, either.”

‘F*ck! He’s trying to renege on the deal?

‘This person actually dares to steal my belongings... How courageous!’

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Are you trying to openly steal my belongings?”

Shi Gangyang’s expression instantly darkened. “Young man, your ability to enter the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy is a reflection of your cultivation talent. However, having talent is one matter, and having trust is another matter. One has to abide by the principle of trust when dealing with others. Yet, you actually dare to falsely accuse the Treasure Forest Pavilion? How audacious!”

He was aware that Ling Han was at the Eternal River Tier. However, he was still completely unafraid. After all, just how powerful was the Treasure Forest Pavilion? They also had numerous Eternal River Tier elites!

Moreover, he was an elite at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, while Ling Han was only at the low extreme. As such, could he not suppress Ling Han?

Ling Han tapped his fingers, and said, “I’ll give you two options. One, allow Lin Yuqi to speak with me. Two, I’ll beat you until you become obedient, and then we can discuss this again.”

“Hahahaha!” Shi Gangyang roared with laughter upon hearing this. “Young man, you’re far too arrogant!”

He knew who Ling Han was. Back then, he had even helped Lin Yuqi’s branch family win first place in their clan competition. News of this had spread far and wide, and the other three families had all heard about it as well. However, none of them had taken it to heart. After all, who would care about a measly Heavenly Body Tier cultivator?

Thus, he had been given a fright upon learning that Ling Han had already advanced to the Eternal River Tier. However, before the small mountain of Level 14 Godly metal, how could he suppress his greed?

“To tell you the truth, so what if those Godly metals are yours? It’s your word against mine, so who would believe you? However, seeing that you’ve also made some contributions, here, this is your commission.” Shi Gangyang tossed out a spatial ring.

Pa!

The spatial ring landed on the ground and started to spin around. Meanwhile, there was a look of disdain on Shi Gangyang’s face.

Apart from Saints, the Treasure Forest Pavilion wasn’t afraid of anyone else!

Could Ling Han become a Saint?

The answer was clearly no. This was because he hadn’t become the Star Sand Saint’s disciple. Moreover, he had only ranked second among the new students during the initial recruitment. The honor of first rank had gone to Gu Daoyi. However, after Gu Daoyi’s “disappearance”, the Star Sand Saint still hadn’t taken Ling Han as his disciple.

This was a clear sign that the Great Saint didn’t believe in Ling Han’s ability to become a Saint.

Even a Great Saint didn’t believe in his abilities, so his fate was as good as sealed!

Regardless of how powerful Ling Han became, he would still only be an Eternal River Tier elite. However, how many Eternal River Tier elites did the four clans of the Treasure Forest Pavilion have? A frightening number!

The spatial ring finally fell to the ground after spinning for a few more revolutions. It lay there silently, just like that.

“There are 100,000 True Origin Stones inside. That’s already quite a large sum!” Shi Gangyang said with a sneer. “Take it and p*ss off! Otherwise, you won’t even get a single True Origin Stone!”
