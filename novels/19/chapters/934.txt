Chapter 935: Invincible, Sweeping Aside All Opposition

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The students of the Western Institution surged forth continuously, dashing forward bravely without care for their safety.

This was not a mortal duel. No matter how harsh Ling Han was, he could not possibly kill or cripple them. As a result, they had lost much of their wariness, and aroused their bloodthirst and courage, determined to give this scoundrel that dared not to take their Western Institution seriously a good thrashing.

Unfortunately, no matter how many lambs there were, how could they be a match for a fierce lion? What more when they could not even be considered lambs in front of Ling Han.

Ling Han threw out a careless punch, and the people dispersed like they were flowers scattered by a divine fairy. Peng , immediately, over a dozen people were sent flying. It seemed accomplished very easily, and was not the slightest bit difficult.

“Senior Brother Jia, it’s all up to you now!” Everyone turned their eyes to a thin young man. He looked like a bean sprout, and his whole body looked like it was skin wrapped over bones.

This young man nodded, and suddenly took a deep breath. Peng , his left shoulder and hand seemed to have been pumped full of air, and abruptly enlarged. Then, it was his right arm, torso, his two legs... Only his head still maintained its original appearance.

Abruptly, he had transformed from a bean sprout into a nine-meter-tall giant. His muscles were bursting, and reflected light as if they were covered in a layer of oil.

“Senior Brother has cultivated an incomplete Heaven Swallowing Technique. Normally, he only has battle prowess of 18 Stars, but once he explodes, his battle prowess can reach 21 Stars, or even more than that!”

“Humph, Senior Brother Jia’s talent is not weaker than Ye Chengyun’s in the first place. However, Ye Chengyun could attain 21 Stars of battle prowess in normal condition, whereas Senior Brother Jia’s exploded battle prowess will definitely be capable of surpassing him.”

“22 Stars!”

Everyone was filled with anticipation. Their Senior Brother Jia should be able to save the day, suppressing Ling Han so that the Western Institution would not continue being embarrassed.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Senior Brother Jia rushed out towards Ling Han. His current figure was huge and frighteningly heavy. Every step he placed on the ground was as loud as a clap of thunder, and even the ground itself was trembling as if it would split open at any moment.

With him rushing forth like that, everyone else raced away. Senior Brother Jia was too strong now. They would suffer even if merely the shock wave swept over them.

Hong!

Senior Brother Disciple Jia shot out a punch, aiming at Ling Han’s head.

In front of his colossal body that was nine meters tall, Ling Han was practically like a newborn, pitifully small.

“Thrash him to death!” the masses cheered.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. The battle prowess this giant exploded with had actually surpassed Ye Chengyun’s. Unfortunately, he had obviously used a kind of secret technique to forcefully boost his battle prowess, and could only maintain his boosted battle prowess for a pitifully short time.

Yet it was precisely because of that that the focused explosion of battle prowess would naturally be incomparably terrifying.

Still, compared with Ling Han, this bit of battle prowess was absolutely not enough.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, parrying lightly.

Pa , the fist that Senior Brother had shot out could not descend any further once it had arrived right on top of Ling Han’s head.

But, because their two figures were completely unequal, while this fist from Senior Brother Jia was frighteningly huge, covering Ling Han’s head, others would not be able to see the real situation. Many of them thought that Ling Han had been hit, and could not help but begin cheering.

They roared for a while, but when they discovered that Ling Han was still standing firm, they could not help but look stunned.

Was this guy a monster?

Ling Han lifted his hand, and Senior Brother Jia’s massive torso was raised high above his head. He was like an ant lifting up a huge lion, making for a bizarre and disharmonious scene.

“Go!” Ling Han swatted his hand, and xiu , Senior Brother Jia was tossed away. He landed heavily on a wall, and stopped with a bang.

Pu!

Senior Brother Jia let out a shockingly loud fart, launching his whole person up into the air. However, his body was quickly shrinking, and in an instant, he returned to his original size.

His battle prowess... had also returned to 18 Stars of Shattering Void Tier.

Even someone as strong as Senior Brother Jia was no match for Ling Han!

Finally, the students of the Western Institution became afraid. The person they were facing was no ordinary genius. An advantage in numbers was not the slightest bit useful in front of this monster.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and asked, “You still want to fight?”

They all looked at the people who were lying all over the place. By now, the number had surpassed more than half of them, yet Ling Han was still looking as if he hadn’t even warmed up yet, completely unruffled and calm.

They shook their heads simultaneously. They were not going to fight anymore; this guy was too monstrous!

Their best bet was to wait for this monster to advance into the Mountain River Tier so that they could ask their senior brother and senior sister disciples in the Mountain River Tier to deal with him.

“If we aren’t going to fight anymore, I’m going back to sleep!” Ling Han did not say any more words of apology. He had already thrashed more than half of the people of the Western Institution onto the ground, so if he said anything along the lines of apologies, it would be as if he was showing off, having the opposite effect.

He left, his arms crossed behind his back. The people of the Western Institution could only watch helplessly, their eyes shooting fire.

Actually, Ling Han himself was also very displeased. Although he had really shown off his might here, he had been forced to do so.

‘Zhao Lun, Zhao Lun, looks like our feud is established!’ Ling Han thought.

Did he have the ability to oppose Zhao Lun now? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

No!

Setting aside Zhao Lun, even the three great followers beneath him, as well as the subordinates below these followers, were people he was no match for. There was nothing that could be done. The gap between the Mountain River Tier and Shattering Void Tier was too massive.

‘I have to rush up to the Mountain River Tier. Then, with my potential, it would definitely not be difficult to become a five star genius! Then, I would be able to match an opponent in the middle stage of the middle levels of the Mountain River Tier when I myself am in the lower levels. At least I would not be so passive.

‘Zhao Lun resents me because of Senior Sister Shui, so she would be his weakness. Then, I will pretend to be intimate with Senior Sister Shui to get back at him. I’m not someone who doesn’t take revenge when he should.’

***

On the second day, the monthly assessment that took place once every month in the Northern Institution began.

This was to assess everyone’s abilities and check whether they had improved or degraded. After all, there were some that had entered into the Academy with gritted teeth—after they successfully enrolled into the Academy, it could not be helped that they would relax and no longer work hard at cultivation. So, it was possible for their abilities to not rise, but instead fall.

The path of martial arts was an uphill battle.

If someone’s ability declined, the first time would garner them a warning, the second time would result in elimination of all favorable conditions, and the third would lead to expulsion. Thus, the monthly assessment was still quite important.

Over 500 new students arrived.

Shui Yanyu’s eyes swept once over each person’s face, and she said, “Today, the monthly assessment will be conducted. Everyone must put their full effort into it. If you perform worse than when you entered the Academy, you will receive a warning from the Academy, and after three times, you will be directly expelled.”

“Yes!” they all answered with utmost seriousness.

Ling Han raised his hand, stood up, and asked, “Senior Sister, if we get the first place, is there any reward?”

Shui Yanyu shook her head, and answered, “No.”

“No reward?” Instantly, Ling Han lost all interest. Sprawling out on the table, he dozed off. If there was no reward, what motivation was there for him to do well?

Looking at his laidback appearance, Shui Yanyu could not help but feel irritated.

This guy, his ability was obviously so strong, so why did he not have the slightest bit of assertiveness? Where was your sense of responsibility?

If it weren’t for the fact that this guy was her husband-in-name, she would really not bother herself with him!

“Let’s begin!” she declared, displeased.

This so-called test, in simple terms, was a fight. If that was not the case, what else could it be?

Yet no one dared to challenge Ling Han. They had all agreed tacitly that he was in the first place.

What a joke. Just yesterday, Senior Brother Ling had challenged the whole Western Institution all by himself; how awesome was that? If you were stronger than Senior Brother Ling, then wouldn’t you have to step out as well if the Western Institution came and looked for trouble?

Wouldn’t that be looking for a beating?

Thus, Ling Han had obviously not fought a single battle, but he had automatically obtained the first place in this monthly assessment.
