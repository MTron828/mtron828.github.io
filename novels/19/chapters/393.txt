Chapter 394: Encountering Ao Feng Again

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han looked at Ao Feng. Several months had passed, yet this genius of the Ao Family already crossed into the Flower Blossom Tier. He had an intangible constitution, clearly standing there yet nonexistent like the void. That feeling made him sick to the point of wanting to vomit.

The best solution was not to look at him.

Flower Blossom Tiers surpassed mortals, even Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors couldn’t stare at them—an inkling of their power.

His expression was calm, but inside he was extremely vigilant. Flower Blossom Tier martial artists were too strong, such that even if he were at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier now, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to resist; this limit was extremely hard to cross over.

If Ao Feng made a move, he would immediately enter the Black Tower.

...Thunder Battle Armor? Not to mention whether the power it could unleash in his hands was able to block Ao Feng or not, as long as he used it, wasn’t it equivalent to telling Ao Feng that he was “Han Lin”?

“Who are you?” Ao Feng asked indifferently, unleashing his godly might like a supreme god.

‘Cocky!’ Ling Han said inwardly. Only those newbies who just crossed into the Flower Blossom Tier would make a show of their presence. It was a sort of mentality as their strength surpassed the mortal limit—but would their mentality also make the same leap?

He showed no sign of fear, took out his golden badge, brandishing it, and said, “I am Ling Han, low level Earth Grade alchemist!”

‘Hiss!’

Ao Feng involuntarily gasped in astonishment—such a young Earth Grade alchemist? That was way too ridiculous. However, with his vision, he could tell that the badge was real with a single glance.

He was a Flower Blossom Tier warrior, which was certainly out of the ordinary. The problem was that low level Earth Grade alchemists were treated as equals to Flower Blossom Tier warriors, and because of the rarity of alchemists, they were actually a level higher—even Spiritual Infant Tier elites had to be very courteous toward alchemists.

But could Flower Blossom Tiers earn the courtesy of Spiritual Infant Tier warriors? No way. The tiers of martial arts were rigidly stratified; if someone at the Flower Blossom Tier were smug in front of someone in the Spiritual Infant Tier, the former would be swatted to death!

...Unless they had a father at the Deity Transformation Tier or the Heaven Tier or something; and if you had a Shattering Void Tier cultivator as your father, then making Spiritual Infant Tiers kneel down to lick your feet wasn’t something impossible.

“So it’s Master Ling.” Ao Feng withdrew his lofty attitude. He just entered the Flower Blossom and there might be a time in the future where he needed to ask Ling Han to refine pills. Besides, alchemists were a very united group, so offending one could mean offending the entire group. Thus, he’d rather not become enemies with Ling Han.

Of course, it was mainly because he had the thought of asking Ling Han to refine pills in the future, or else who would know that he killed Ling Han in the Dark Demon Forest?

Ling Han cupped his hands, and said, “You’re too polite.” He was neither cold nor indifferent, just right in expressing the arrogance peculiar to alchemists.

This was his true quality, so he naturally handled it with ease.

“How come Master Ling has come to Dark Demon Forest alone... No, with just the two of you?” Ao Feng asked. He had just saw Hu Niu and felt somewhat astounded that he overlooked her earlier.

At such heights as his, all things should be reflected in his consciousness regardless of size, but he overlooked Hu Niu... an extremely strange thing. Fortunately, it was just a five to six years old little girl, it mattered not if he overlooked her.

“I need a stalk of spirit medicine; if Brother Ao can find it, there’ll definitely be a handsome reward,” Ling Han said smilingly.

Hearing this, Ao Feng instantly felt full of revulsion within.

He was a Flower Blossom Tier, but a seventeen to eighteen year old youngster with the Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivation was actually calling him a brother... It naturally made him feel very out of sorts. It couldn’t be denied that Ling Han was an Earth Grade alchemist, and having a low cultivation and being young weren’t a problem at all.

“What spirit medicine is Master Ling searching for?” Ao Feng asked. He had set out to get on friendly terms with Ling Han, and now he naturally placed his stance lower.

“Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass,” Ling Han said seriously while laughing inwardly. If Ao Feng really found the spirit medicine, then when he refined the Restore Spirit Pill for Ling Dong Xing in the future, making his father’s cultivation skyrocket before at last suppressing Ao Feng and telling Ao Feng the truth... would this guy spurt out blood from anger?

It was truly something to look forward to.

“All right, I’ve remembered it. If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely deliver the spirit medicine myself.” Ao Feng nodded, then went on, “I have other things to take care of, farewell!”

“Please.” Ling Han also nodded.

Ao Feng left treading on wind, and very soon disappeared into the horizon.

Ling Han’s gaze turned cold. He was contemplating if he should become blood brothers with Ao Feng—wouldn’t this guy have to call Ling Dong Xing uncle? Ha, he immediately shook his head and forgot such distasteful stuff.

“Ling Han dislikes that bad guy?” Hu Niu suddenly asked.

Ling Han said smilingly, “Niu Niu is real smart, you even saw through that.”

Hu Niu giggled. She was most sensitive to presence and emotions; even if Ling Han intentionally suppressed the hatred, deceiving even Ao Feng, it couldn’t escape Hu Niu’s eyes.

“However, we’ll have to be careful from now on,” Ling Han said, walking into the valley with Hu Niu.

The Ice Fire Gourd Valley was half a world of ice and half surging with lava. Once one entered, there was boundless snow that covered the entire valley, a field of white without a single shred or inch of motley—it was a rather splendid sight.

“There’s a large snake here,” Ling Han said.

“Niu wants to eat snake meat!” Hu Niu’s eyes immediately lit up, saliva almost drooling out.

Ling Han laughed loudly and said, “That’s a peak stage Spiritual Pedestal Tier being, I can’t beat it, can you?”

“Niu can’t beat it.” Hu Niu sighed dejectedly, appearing extremely disappointed.

This shock was too great for a foodie.

“Our main purpose is to find Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass. This large snake can be taken care of when we come back in the future,” Ling Han said.

“En!” Hu Niu nodded lovably.

The two walked very fast, passing through the ice valley, and a sea of fire appeared before them, crimson colored lava rolling around—a scene that would make one’s scalp creep.

Between the sea of fire and the layer of ice was an expanse of boiling water that acted as a buffer. However, no matter whether it was the sea of fire or the layer of ice, the power of either was extremely strong, so neither was devoured by the other, existing like so for several thousand years.

...To Ling Han’s knowledge, there had been no such place like the Dark Demon Forest. Well, there might’ve been such a place, just that he didn’t know—after all, the vast lands were too massive.

Ling Han carefully searched locations where Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass could grow. Such a spirit medicine could only survive in the buffer zone, absorbing the power of the chilling ice and the raging flames, or else it wouldn’t be able to survive at all.

However, the buffer zone was all boiling water, without any surfacing rocks. This dictated that Crimson Red Chilling Ice grass couldn’t possibly grow, because this spirit grass disliked water environment.

He came for nothing.

Ling Han took out the map. On it were several special landforms that were marked, but other than this Ice Fire Gourd Valley, there were no other places that was suitable for the growth of Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass.

Unless... it was Dark Demon Forest’s core area.

Hong!

At this moment, earth-shattering sounds reverberated as a fully silver-colored large snake broke through the ice. The snake’s head alone was several meters high, and the length of the snake’s entire body was extremely shocking.

Ling Han was astounded—not because of the large snake’s length, but because of the tumor on the top of its head.

Was it turning into a flood dragon?Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
