1263 Conflic

A hush suddenly fell over the tavern.

That was Xie Donglai!

Although everyone knew that the Wolf Fang City prohibited private skirmishes, who wasn’t afraid of getting on the bad side of Xie Donglai? Doing so would mean becoming an enemy of Great General Xie. Who was willing to shoulder such a terrifying consequence?

If one offended the Xie Clan, how many people in the world would still dare to associate themselves with them?

Moreover, Xie Donglai was an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and he was more so a prodigy who had a great chance of reaching the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, few people dared to offend him.

Xie Donglai looked around, and no one dared to meet his gaze. He was like a mighty and invincible ruler.

He chuckled coldly. These lowly commoners actually dared to talk behind his back! If this weren’t the Wolf Fang City, he would definitely kill all of them.

‘Hmm?’

He faltered slightly. This was because a young man was still drinking leisurely as if he hadn’t noticed his arrival at all.

Moreover, this young man stood out like a sore thumb. The tables around him were all empty, and this was a huge contrast to the otherwise bustling scenes in the tavern.

Xie Donglai strode over. As he did so, two elders followed behind him. In fact, these two elders had always been following him. It was just that they had maintained a relatively large distance just then, making it seem as if they weren’t with Xie Donglai.

He sat down opposite to Ling Han, and then released his consummate level aura. An overwhelming pressure surged toward Ling Han.

Ling Han was unfazed, yet killing intent had already welled up in his heart. However, he didn’t have the ability to kill Xie Donglai, and this wasn’t a good place to fight, either. Thus, he could only mull over other ways to rattle Xie Donglai.

This person dared to pester his wife, so there was naturally no reason to go easy on him.

“Mister, how should I address you?” Xie Donglai asked. There was a hint of astonishment in his eyes. This young man was actually unaffected by his aura!

‘It’s clear that he’s only at the peak stage of the low extreme, so how is his divine sense so powerful?’

“Ni Ba[1],” Ling Han replied casually.

Xie Donglai was clearly very intelligent, and a look of anger instantly spread across his face. This brat actually dared to mock him? He humphed, and said, “Young man, is it really appropriate to offend others so readily?”

“Idiot, you sat at my table without an invitation. If I don’t deride you, whom will I deride?” He hadn’t wanted to offend Xie Donglai so soon, but who told him to ask for trouble?

Xie Donglai squinted his handsome eyes as killing intent oozed from his body. This young man was far too audacious. He even dared to mock him, a grandson of the Xie Clan! He was unafraid of the rules in this city, and he was just about to act on his killing intent.

“Young Master!” the two elders called softly. They had been standing by the staircase just then, yet they took a huge stride and arrived behind Xie Donglai at this moment.

If one attacked someone else in the Wolf Fang City, they would receive a punishment equal to 10 times the damage that they dealt. Of course, one would simply be executed if they killed someone else. Their corpse wouldn’t be whipped.

This was a rule that had been formulated by several Eternal River Tier elites. If Xie Donglai dared to break this rule, he would be punished just like everyone else. Although Great General Xie was influential, Xie Donglai wasn’t important enough to receive his full support.

Of course, if it were Great General Xie who killed someone in this city, perhaps the Purple Moon Divine Maiden would simply protest for a bit. She definitely wouldn’t go all out to enforce the rule.

Similarly, Great General Xie wouldn’t go all out against several Eternal River Tier elites if Xie Donglai were killed by the forces of the Wolf Fang City. It simply wasn’t worth it.

Thus, it would be best if everyone followed this rule.

Xie Donglai clearly understood this reasoning as well, so he had no choice but to forcefully suppress his wild fury. Few people had dared to provoke him like this before. There were some, but the grass before their graves was already long.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had dared to escape their wedding, and now a young man dared to humiliate him to his face. Heh, what was the world coming to?

He stood up, and said, “Young man, I’ll remember this!”

With his abilities, he could naturally tell that Ling Han was wearing a disguise at this moment. However, this didn’t matter, as he could remember Ling Han’s aura. It was extremely difficult for cultivators to change their aura, unless they switched to a different cultivation technique.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You should have p*ssed off long ago. You’re affecting my appetite.”

Xie Donglai’s expression darkened, and he wanted to explode again. However, he was a supreme prodigy, after all, so he forcefully suppressed his dangerous urge. He felt like he couldn’t stay here any longer. Otherwise, he wound definitely explode in anger.

Cultivators should have been unconstrained in paying their debts of gratitude and revenge. Holding his anger in distressed him immensely.

He turned around and left. The two elders behind him glared at Ling Han for a short moment before also turning around and leaving.

Conversations gradually returned to the tavern. However, after what had happened just then, the tavern was much quieter than before. The customers glanced at Ling Han as they conversed, and they all felt that this person was extremely bold and courageous. He had actually dared to provoke a member of the Xie Clan!

An elder shook his head, and said, “He’s still young, so it’s not surprising that he wasn’t able to control his temper. Moreover, this is the Wolf Fang City, so Xie Donglai obviously didn’t dare to attack him. However, is this young man going to hide in the Wolf Fang City forever?” The old man felt that Ling Han was far too rash.

Ling Han had come here to gather information, not to eat or drink. Seeing the current situation, he decided that there was no point in staying any longer. He paid his tab and returned to the auction house.

There were only two days until the auction began.

Meanwhile, Rabbit and the old ginseng took to this city like fish took to water. They were free and unfettered as they strolled around all day long. Ling Han wasn’t worried about them, as this pair of bad friends was extremely slimy and hard to catch. Unless they were targeted by Heavenly Body Tier elites, there was truly no way one could capture them.

Two days passed by in a flash, and Ling Han entered the lobby of the auction house with his Realm Spirit Stones. He had already handed the alchemical pills to the auction house, but the Realm Spirit Stones were far too valuable to hand over. Thus, he had kept them on him this entire time. He would only hand them over at the time of the auction.

He found a worker and asked them to report his arrival to the manager from the Jin Clan. While he was waiting, he suddenly saw a familiar face appear. It was none other than Xie Donglai! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

With Xie Donglai’s status and wealth, it was only normal for him to attend this kind of auction. Moreover, as someone at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, he naturally had an urgent desire to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier or the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, he was hell-bent on obtaining the palm-sized Realm Spirit Stone.

“You?” A dark expression fell across Xie Donglai’s handsome face when he saw Ling Han. He chuckled coldly, and said, “Heh, the Gold Origin Auction House is truly becoming more and more low class. Even commoners like you are able to attend?”

“Heir Xie, are you referring to...” A person from the auction house was walking beside Xie Donglai. Because of Xie Donglai’s high status, the auction house also regarded him as an important customer. Thus, they sent a relatively high-ranking person to accompany him.

This person was called Jin Xuan, and he had always yearned to climb to a higher position. Thus, Xie Donglai became someone who he wanted to become acquainted with. If he could form a relationship with the Xie Clan, his status in the Jin Clan would definitely climb exponentially.

Xie Donglai pointed at Ling Han, and said, “I detest this brat!”

“I understand!” Jin Xuan nodded, then turned to the two workers beside him, and said, “What are you two waiting for? Hurry up and kick him out!”

He had never seen Ling Han before, so he didn’t know that Ling Han was the patron selling the Realm Spirit Stones. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t talk or act like this.

Now, however, he had committed a huge mistake.
