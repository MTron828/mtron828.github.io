Chapter 1360 Leaving the city

A sliver of satisfaction appeared on Ling Han’s face. He had finally fulfilled his promise to Old Man Xu.

He had gained many benefits from Old Man Xu. Whether it was the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique or the Universal Eight Desolation Technique, both were extremely first-class techniques, and had been of great help to him. And he was the type of person to repay the smallest favor many times over.

He had kept Old Man Xu’s matter constantly on his mind, and now that he had completed the task, he felt a sense of relief.

This time, he could return to the Joint Peace Planet without any further worries.

“Young Master Han, you are really rich and imposing, I admit defeat!” Zhao Ku exclaimed, giving him a thumbs up. Some of it was merely an act, but there was also some part that was sincere. After all, even he couldn’t take out such a large amount of wealth—or at least not recently.

Ling Han merely smiled slightly. He and Zhao Ku were not comrades, and he did not have the slightest intention to befriend him.

Next, there were a great many other items being auctioned off. There was Godly metal, as well as God Tools and alchemical pills. It was a diverse variety of items.

Ling Han made his move, and purchased all the Godly metal to be swallowed by his Divine Demon Sword. As for God Tools, he took no action. At the same price, he could buy 10 times the amount of Godly metal. In any case, it would all be fed to the Divine Demon Sword, so why would he have to deliberately purchase the more expensive ones?

“Yi, why does this God Tool look a little familiar?” Zhao Ku was watching in boredom, but when a long saber was brought out for auction, he scratched his head. He felt that that thing was extraordinarily familiar.

Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden smiled secretly. How could it possibly be unfamiliar? It had in the first place been Zhao Ku’s God Tool, which was then snatched by Ling Han, who took it here to be auctioned off.

The God Tools were first traded for True Origin Stones, which were then used to buy Godly metal. The amount would definitely be much more than the God Tools themselves, even if part of it went to the auction house as service fee.

Soon after, Zhao Ku continuously discovered that a great many of the God Tools being on auction here gave him a very familiar feeling, and only when the final Divine Sword was being auctioned did he suddenly remember that these were all f******* his!

He couldn’t help but look at Ling Han plaintively. As it turned out, all his property had been sold off by Ling Han.

Though he was internally displeased, he did not dare show his feelings in the slightest. What a joke. Ling Han was the descendant of a Genesis Tier, so even in a competition of backgrounds, he would lose. Of course, if his background was slightly stronger, he would definitely show his true colors and immediately turn hostile with Ling Han.

That was the type of man he was.

Zhao Ku also made his move, and bought a few God Tools that were his in the first place. Those God Tools that deserved to be in his collection were naturally out of the ordinary. However, because Gu Shaoyun had lost the competition for the Highest Jade Essence Heart, he naturally bore a grudge against Zhao Ku as well. Thus, he deliberately increased the bidding price, causing Zhao Ku to experience terrible loss.

He almost wanted to cry. They were obviously his God Tools, yet he still had to buy them back at such a high price. At the same time, he was also gritting his teeth with resentment toward Gu Shaoyun, and swore that he would definitely make the latter suffer. He actually dared to defy him.

The auction continued for a very long time, and only ended five days later. Ling Han, meanwhile, had gained much from this auction. Not only had he obtained the Highest Jade Essence Heart, he had also bought a great amount of Level 9 Godly metal.

He went off to settle his bill, yet had only paid 70,000,000 True Origin Stones. That was because he had earned more than 400,000,000 from the alchemical pills and God Tools he had auctioned off. If it was not for the fact that he had also bought a great amount of Godly metal, he could actually earn quite a large number of True Origin Stones even.

“Situ Lin?” When Ling Han came out, he saw a young man was standing in front of him. The latter had a slender, tall build, with very thin eyes. He stared fixedly at Ling Han. “I’ll remember you.”

He was Gu Shaoyun.

After he said this, he turned around and left. He actually did not give Ling Han the slightest chance to speak.

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange. The grudge and resentment had actually been born by Situ Lin; should he chase after him and give him a proper explanation?

Forget it, he was too lazy. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Hahahaha!” Zhao Ku, meanwhile, laughed raucously. When he thought of the expression that Gu Shaoyun would have on his face when he discovered he had made such an unexpected mistake in future, he couldn’t help but laugh so much that his stomach was aching.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden left. He naturally would not care if Gu Shaoyun and Situ Lin would come to blows in future.

When they returned to the inn, they made some preparations and planned to take their leave in order to head to Big Trade City. After this, they would then leave the Cloud Apex Planet and head back to the Joint Peace Planet. When 100 years passed, Ling Han would return here and head to the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy in the Myriad Directions Galaxy to meet the true prodigies of the Immortal Realm.

“I can’t leave with you.” Li Ruotong bit her lip. “The clan has already sent people out to stand guard at the city gates. If I leave the city, they would definitely capture and take me back by force.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly, and said, “That’s all right. If I want to take someone away, who could stop me?”

Li Ruotong naturally would not believe him. Though Ling Han was very strong, he was only in the early stage of the low extreme, after all. Even if he was a 10-star genius, that would only be capable of matching the late stage of the high extreme, but the Li Clan had an ancestor in the consummate level, who was furthermore a four-star genius!

There was no doubt that this would be a one-sided battle.

But this was the master of her beloved, so even if there was much disbelief in her heart, she did not dare voice her doubt.

However, she soon discovered that the others were all smiling as if they had full confidence in Ling Han.

‘What’s going on?

She knew that Ling Han was very freakish, but weren’t they all a little too blindly admiring of this man?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s also time to bring Jiuyao and Ruotong into the Black Tower.”

With a wave of his hand, he had brought all of them into the Black Tower.

Instantly, those who had not entered the Black Tower before were all extremely surprised. This was a Spatial God Tool!

Ling Han brought them all to the roots of the Reincarnation Tree, and said, “You all first comprehend Dao here, and when we return to Big Trade City, I will let you all know you can come back out.”

“All right!” Feng Po Yun nodded. “After the battle with the Earth Dragon Sect, I have accumulated a great amount of insight about martial arts, and I precisely need to carefully comprehend what I have obtained.”

“En!” Murong Qing nodded.

Li Ruotong was already stunned speechless, but Jiuyao’s adaptability was incredibly frightening. He had already sat down in a cross-legged position under the Reincarnation Tree, and begun to comprehend Dao. Meanwhile, the Notionless Saint and the Asura Demon Emperor had long since been sitting here. They were presently cultivating tirelessly in seclusion, and had not been disturbed by their arrival.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden left the Black Tower. Now, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had met with the bottleneck before the Heavenly Body Tier. It was not something that could be overcome with mere comprehension. Perhaps a slight pause would cause a flash of inspiration.

Thus, she still decided to walk outside and have a taste of life to accumulate her appreciation.

The couple walked side by side, and headed out of the city.

It was obvious that they were known to the three great clans by now. When they arrived at the city gates, they encountered a very strict interrogation—that was because Immortals could shrink their size, and it was very common for them to hide in the sleeves of others and take advantage of the opportunity to be brought out of the city.

But Ling Han was in the Heavenly Body Tier. Who dared to come near him and do a body search? In the eyes of others, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also in the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and similarly could not be easily offended.

Thus, even if there were Heavenly Body Tier elites on guard here, they merely swept over them a few times with their divine sense, confirming that there was no additional life signs coming from Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden before letting them go.

Ling Han neared the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and whispered into her ear, “Just guess. Would we be hunted down later?”

“That is definite,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden replied.

There was still a great number of True Origin Stones on Ling Han, as well as the Highest Jade Essence Heart. Previously, when they were in the city, everyone would still have a bit of wariness, but the moment they exited the city, it was definite that all the bad characters would be popping out of the woodwork.

“If we can’t talk reason, we can only resort to bloodshed!” A flicker of killing intent flashed through Ling Han’s eyes.
