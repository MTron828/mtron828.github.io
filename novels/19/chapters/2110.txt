Chapter 2111: More than One!

Ling Han had waited for this word for heaven knew how long. Upon hearing it, he hurriedly shouted, “Senior, it’s right here!”

Lu Hairong immediately came to a stop. A valley appeared before them, and this was a valley that was brimming with murderous aura.

“It’s most likely here,” Lu Hairong said with a nod. She was born after that chaotic battle, so she had only heard about it from the elders in the Roc Palace. She naturally wouldn’t have any impressions of this place.

However, the murderous aura in this place had almost become tangible. Either a great number of people or a heaven-defyingly powerful elite had died here. Otherwise, the murderous aura definitely couldn’t be so overwhelming.

“Be careful!”

The force of darkness had already arrived here long ago. In fact, they might have even set up a formation that could slay Celestial Kings. Thus, they naturally had to be careful.

The Black Dragon King was definitely at the Celestial King Tier, and they were simply unsure about which Heaven he was at.

Xiao Gu led the way, while Lu Hairong protected the rear, keeping Ling Han, Hu Niu, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou safe. As for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she wouldn’t participate in this adventure.

“It’s a shame that the detestable dog isn’t here. Otherwise, our victory would be almost certain,” Ling Han said with slight pity.

The large black dog had been able to steal Celestial King Ling Miao’s underwear, so he was either an Eighth Heaven Celestial King or a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. With such strength, he could essentially do whatever he wanted in the Celestial Realm.

Upon entering the valley, it was inevitable that they ruined the previously stable atmosphere. Murderous aura instantly surged toward them, transforming into a sword as it slashed down at them.

“Shatter!” Lu Hairong launched a palm strike, and with the power of Regulations, a gigantic light symbol formed before her, slapping at the sword.

Peng!

There was a dull thud as the sword was shattered into smithereens. Meanwhile, the light symbol continued to surge forward.

Peng, peng, peng!

The murderous aura in its path was crushed, and only after striking the mountain did the light symbol finally come to a halt. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This Fourth Heaven Celestial King… was powerful!

However, Lu Hairong didn’t look happy at all. She had indeed blocked this attack with ease. However, this had only been a casually formed burst of murderous aura, yet it could already rival the attack of a First Heaven Celestial King.

She couldn’t let her guard down. Otherwise, they might be taken by surprise and fall into a perilous situation.

“Damn it! The strong winds have come again!” Ling Han suddenly shouted in astonishment.

After staying on this continent for three years, they were already extremely familiar with the environment here. Every 10 days or so, strong winds would rage through the continent.

If this were in the outside world, such strong winds wouldn’t pose much of a problem. With Lu Hairong and Xiao Gu’s protection, they could easily endure this strong wind. However, things were different in this valley. The murderous aura here was far too terrifying, and even the smallest wisp of murderous aura would possess devastating destructive power. After it was riled by the strong winds, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would frown at its power.

Anyhow, the birth of these strong winds was because this continent was located in the void that was surrounded by storms of energy. Even though things were much better on the continent, they still had to face these strong and destructive winds once every 10 days.

At this moment, a wall of wind that measured a whopping 3000 meters in height violently surged over. It was as if this wall of wind would obliterate anything and everything in its path.

“That cave! Hurry!”

There was a cave in the mountainside, and its mere existence signified that it had endured heaven knew how many waves of these strong and destructive winds. This time would be no different.

They hurriedly dashed into the cave. In just a moment, the wall of wind was already upon them.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The murderous aura transformed into all kinds of weapons, violently tearing at the surroundings.

Gashes started to appear on the mountainside, yet surprisingly, the valley wasn’t flattened and destroyed.

“This is purely a windstorm of Regulations; it doesn’t possess much power,” Lu Hairong explained. If this windstorm only possessed Regulations, it would be most destructive toward life forms. However, it would be a completely different story for inanimate objects.

This was analogous to how a drop of poison could easily kill someone, but if it were dripped onto stone, there would be no effect at all.

There were only gashes on the mountain wall because of the force of the strong winds.

Of course, this valley was definitely as sturdy as could be due to the existence of the murderous aura. It was only because there were wisps of murderous aura in the strong winds that the winds could even leave gashes in the mountain. Otherwise, the winds would do absolutely nothing to the mountains.

Blades of wind slashed into the cave, yet they were all easily blocked by Lu Hairong and Xiao Gu. They didn’t face much danger. However, the strong winds continued, and the blades of wind also continued to rush into the cave. It was as if tens of thousands of First Heaven Celestial Kings were attacking them in unison. If it weren’t for the humongous gulf between each Heaven of the Celestial King Tier, Lu Hairong and Xiao Gu would have definitely been overwhelmed by these blades of wind.

After an hour, the strong winds finally calmed down. They would only rise again in 10 days.

They left the cave, only to see that the valley had already returned to a state of calm. Murderous aura continued to swarm, and it was as if it were steam.

When they walked out, the murderous aura in the valley immediately reacted, transforming into sabers and swords that slashed over. However, they were all easily blocked by Lu Hairong.

The valley was colossal, and the group could see traces of battle everywhere.

“This valley actually wasn’t obliterated by the chaotic battle between the Celestial Kings?” Ling Han asked in curiosity.

“This place is the Azure Origin Valley,” Lu Hairong said after pondering for a moment. “According to rumors, a powerful figure refined their source treasure here. Thus, the entire valley was refined by a paramount Regulation. Even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King attacks this valley with all their might, they can only shatter a few stones.”

“Powerful figure?” Ling Han asked.

“Heh.” Lu Hairong didn’t explain.

‘Heavenly Venerate, right?’ Ling Han thought in his mind.

Otherwise, how could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King only manage to shatter a few stones?

“Hang on!” Small Tower suddenly shouted. It faltered for a moment before saying, “Why is this Source Power of heaven and earth so strange?”

“Perhaps it’s been damaged by the force of darkness?”

“Impossible!” Small Tower said as it swayed from side to side. “Their aim isn’t to damage the Source Power of heaven and earth. Instead, they want to use the Source Power of heaven and earth to corrode and weaken the passageway between the two realms. As such, damaging the Source Power of heaven and earth will be completely pointless.”

“Then what’s wrong?” Ling Han asked in curiosity.

“Huh? Unless!” Small Tower’s voice was surprisingly filled with emotion.

“What did you figure out?”

“You have to realize, Source Powers of heaven and earth are limited in number. Moreover, some Source Powers of heaven and earth are able to achieve dao by themself and become Celestial Kings.” Small Tower suddenly started to talk about unrelated matters.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I know about this.”

“However, even so, of 1000 Celestial Kings, perhaps only one possesses a Source Power of heaven and earth,” Small Tower continued.

Celestial Tools were also rare, yet around one in 10 Celestial Kings would possess a Celestial Tool. Source Powers of heaven and earth were even rarer, and only around one in 1000 Celestial Kings would possess them.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. “You’re saying that tens of thousands of Celestial Kings died back then, so at least 10 Source Powers of heaven and earth would have also died with them. After countless years of nurturing, these Source Powers of heaven and earth should have already been reborn.”

Ling Han didn’t know whether “reborn” was the right word to use. However, this was the word that he found fitting.

“That’s right,” Small Tower replied. In a rare turn of events, Small Tower didn’t tease Ling Han. Instead, it started to sway about with a solemn expression. This was Small Tower nodding its head.

Ling Han’s expression also changed. 10 Source Powers of heaven and earth!

If they allowed the force of darkness to obtain 10 Source Powers of heaven and earth at once, just how much damage would be caused to this heaven and earth?

No wonder Ascent Route Island had only been guarded by an Ascending Origin Tier elite, while this continent was being guarded by a Celestial King.

There were 10 Source Powers of heaven and earth! Perhaps there was one or two more than this, or perhaps there was one or two fewer than this.

They definitely couldn’t allow the force of darkness to succeed!
