Chapter 3404: Floating Wind and Clouds

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Bao Taigong was stunned and quickly ran away.

The golden energy crushed over. If he didn’t dodge, he would only be crushed into pieces.

Ling Han smiled, and unleashed his Lightning Fist, infusing it with golden energy. Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu, the golden energy danced in the skies. His current spiritual power had greatly improved, and he could completely squander it like this.

Bao Taigong did not dare to take it on at all. His power was inferior, and his high-level energy was inferior. Wouldn’t he be courting death if he took it head-on?

However, ten minutes later, his speed immediately slowed down.

—the outbreak period was over.

There was no way he could dodge the Lightning Fist. He was sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood.

All the Demon Race members were completely speechless. This was the suppression of raw strength, leaving them with no excuse at all.

“I… lost!” Bao Taigong still had some elegance. His eyes were dim. He had lost at the hands of the human race, and his opponent was even “weaker” than himself by a major cultivation level. This had severely destroyed his confidence.

How could he be called a prodigy?

Ling Han walked towards Princess Bixiao, and stopped about three meters in front of her. “Princess, may I trouble you to give me the wager?”

Princess Bixiao looked at Ling Han. Her expression was very calm, but there was a strange look in her eyes.

This was killing intent.

Ling Han knew that his performance was too heaven-defying, causing this Demon Race princess to develop killing intent, and she wanted to prevent him from rising up in the future and becoming a huge threat to the Demon Race. It was very likely that he would be another Chen Fengyan.

But what could he do? Before he could even use his ultimate move, Bao Taigong had already been defeated. He was too weak.

In the end, Princess Bixiao did not dare to make a move. Chen Fengyan was too powerful. He had intimidated the Demon Race with his own strength. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It could be said that as long as Chen Fengyan was alive, the Demon Race would not dare to rebel.

She raised her hand, and instantly, the book and a jade seed were tossed towards Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out his hand to receive it, and said with a smile, “I had invited the right person to become the witness. The Princess is fair.”

Princess Bixiao instantly had the urge to beat someone up. Did she want to hand over the Demon Race’s secret technique to Ling Han? Of course not. On the contrary, she still wanted to obtain the Demonic Monkey Fists from Ling Han, but they were in the imperial capital, so how could she dare to make a move so easily?

After Ling Han took the secret tome, he sat at the side and immediately began to flip through it.

He was lacking a movement technique.

He skimmed through it and couldn’t help but smile.

This Floating Wind and Clouds movement technique could be used until the Mystery Realm Tier. After cultivating it to the Great Accomplishment level, it could even allow a cultivator to increase his speed by two times the speed of sound.

Therefore, Bao Taigong had not cultivated Floating Wind and Clouds to Great Accomplishment level. Otherwise, with the speed of the Leopard Clan and this movement technique, his speed would become incomparably terrifying.

Perhaps even if he had rushed up and killed his opponent, the other party would not have any reaction.

“Ling Han!” A man from the Demon Race strode over. He was tall and slender, and on his back were two dark red wings. There wasn’t a single feather on them, and they were completely fleshy.

“Young Master Bat is about to make his move.”

“This is the number one elite in the Extreme Bone Tier. He’ll definitely win once he makes his move.”

“He’s only 22 years old this year, similar to this human, so although his cultivation level is much higher, it’s still a fair battle.”

The Demon Race members spoke one after another. They were filled with confidence in this man from the Demon Race.

His name was Bian Kun, and he came from the Bat Race. Just as the people of the Demon Race had said, he was the number one elite in the Extreme Bone Tier.

If they wanted to overwhelm Ling Han and restore the Demon Race’s reputation of being invincible, they could only rely on Bian Kun now.

Otherwise, even if they still had Ying Pokong, Hu Er, and so on, they were all much older than Ling Han, and could only suppress their cultivation level before fighting.

If they really suppressed their cultivation level to the same level, tt was hard to say if they could defeat Ling Han.

Hong Tianbu and Ling Han were freakish geniuses.

Thus, Bian Kun was the best candidate to fight Ling Han.

“Do you dare to fight?” Bian Kun challenged Ling Han.

Ling Han was currently flipping through the Floating Wind and Clouds movement technique. The more he read, the more fascinated he became. The great elite of the Demon Race who had created this movement technique was truly overflowing with talent, and he was extremely impressed.

“Ling Han!” Bian Kun couldn’t help but feel angry. This human actually dared to ignore him?

If it wasn’t for the fact that he had to clear the Demon Race’s name, he really wanted to attack directly, and not wait for Ling Han to agree to the decisive battle first.

Only then did Ling Han raise his head impatiently, and said, “Don’t you know the rules? In such an occasion, is it appropriate to shout and howl? Do you have any manners?”

Bian Kun was stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses. He was so angry that he spread his wings.

‘Who doesn’t have manners?’

It was clearly you, but you pretended not to hear me when I spoke to you. If not for that, would he need to shout?

He suppressed his anger and said, “I challenge you!”

Ling Han raised his head to look at him, his expression calm.

Bat Kun explained, “Although I have the cultivation level of Fifth Extreme, I’m only 22 years old. It’s not considered bullying you.”

A battle between people of the same cultivation level was indeed fair, but a battle between people of the same age was also fair. If one’s cultivation level was low, it was because one did not work hard enough, did not have enough talent, and did not have enough opportunities. It was impossible for others to give him allowances to accommodate him.

Ling Han smiled leisurely, and said, “Heh, do you know the rules of challenging me?”

F*ck, you want another bet?

Bian Kun snorted and said, “What do you want to bet?”

“And what do you have?” Ling Han asked in return.

Bian Kun’s gaze was baleful. He wasn’t an idiot like Bian Kun. He was really stupid enough to take out a wager. He swept his dark red eyes across the crowd and said, “I’ll use this person as my bet!”

His figure leaped out, and when he returned, he was already holding a person in his hand.

“If you win, you can take him back. Otherwise, I’ll beat him up until he doubts his life.”

“I have nothing to do with this. Let go of me!” The person who was caught immediately struggled.

Ling Han took a look, and couldn’t help but have a strange expression on his face. He smiled, and said, “I’ve always been a person who doesn’t accept threats.”

Coincidentally, the person that Bian Kun caught was Hu Yang.

Hu Yang let out a blood-curdling scream, and said, “Ling Han, you’re using your position for personal revenge!”

Ling Han merely chuckled, and continued to flip through Floating Wind and Clouds. This was truly worth studying.

Only then did Bian Kun realize that he had made a mistake, and had actually captured an “enemy” of Ling Han’s. How could such a threat work?

He reached out and threw Hu Yang out. Then, he flew out again and grabbed another person.

“Ling Han, do you want to be a coward of the human race?” he said coldly.

Ling Han took another look, and almost spluttered with laughter. This time, it was even more coincidental that the person Bian Kun had captured was Gu Xiangming.

However, he controlled himself very well and said solemnly, “Don’t involve innocent people. Release him quickly!”

Gu Xiangming almost vomited blood.

He had paid a huge price to sneak in with a person with an invitation. He was ambitious and did not want to be a captain of the Imperial Guards for the rest of his life. This was a perfect opportunity to expand his connections.

However, how could he have imagined that he would be captured by Bian Kun in an attempt to threaten Ling Han?

What was even more infuriating was that Ling Han actually acted as if the two of them had a very good relationship. If that was the case, would Bian Kun let him off?

You’re so vicious!

As expected, Bian Kun naturally wouldn’t let go.. He squeezed Gu Xiangming’s arm forcefully, and asked balefully, “Ling Han, are you going to fight or not?”
