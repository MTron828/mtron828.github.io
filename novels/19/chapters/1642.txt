Chapter 1643: Shard of the Celestial Realm?

Hearing this loud shout from this middle-aged man, the people in the surrounding area all had strange expressions, feeling extremely awkward.

They all recognized these two people. The older one was Tong Yi, while the younger was called Tong Wenzong, and the Tong Clan was an Eternal River Tier-level force. The ancestor of the Tong Clan was already in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier 100,000,000 years ago, and belonged to the category of veteran elites.

However, who was Ling Han?

A Saint!

In front of a Saint, what was a mere Eternal River Tier consummate level worth? Absolutely bullsh*t.

He actually dared shout and holler at a Saint; what else could this be but an action to court death?

“Brother Tong Yi, how could you be so rude to this lord? Apologize quickly!” someone immediately said. This was Tong Yi’s friend. Otherwise, who would dare interfere at this point at the risk of drawing the anger of a Saint onto themselves?

L-lord?

Tong Yi glanced at the speaker, and couldn’t help but humph internally. ‘What do you mean by that? Are you still my friend? Being so young, if he managed to advance into the Heavenly Body Tier, he would already be extremely lucky, and you call him a lord?

‘Are you trying to trick me!?’

“What bullsh*t lord? Having injured a member of our Tong Clan, even if he was a god, he would have to lower his head and apologize!” he declared arrogantly.

“How dare you!!” Yang Ming leaped out, glaring angrily at Tong Yi.

“Yi, Brother Yang!” Tong Yi was startled. He might not recognize others, but this was one of the well-known figures of the younger generation. His reputation was so established that his name was widely known even in the surrounding galaxies.

This was a prodigy that was destined to become an Eternal River Tier elite, so he naturally had to be treated with respect. At present, he could still address him as Brother Yang, but in future, he would have to address him as Lord Yang.

“Quickly apologize to the lord!” Yang Ming humphed coldly. Even he had to kneel down in apology; just who did Tong Yi think he was?

Tong Yi was startled. Why did even Yang Ming say that? Could it be that this young man came from some powerful background? Hiss, could it be that he was the son of a Saint? Otherwise, even if he was the son of an Eternal River Tier, Yang Ming would not have to act so anxiously.

Suddenly, his face turned pale in fear, and he was in a complete panic.

Ling Han only smiled, and nodded at both Long Yushan and Long Xiangyue. Holding the hand of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he walked along the passageway.

Tong Yi watched on from behind, and didn’t even dare to breathe too loudly. When Ling Han and his group had completely disappeared from sight, he finally asked, “Brother Yang, just who is that person?”

“That person?” Yang Ming humphed coldly. “That is a Saint!”

Pu!

Tong Yi abruptly spluttered, and coughed uncontrollably. His expression was filled with shock. “Brother Yang, don’t scare me. With how young he is, how could he possibly be a Saint?”

“Just consider carefully how you are going to make your apologies to that lord. Otherwise, not only you, but possibly even your whole Tong Clan will be eliminated!” Yang Ming said. This was not an exaggeration. If a Saint was angered, the heaven and earth would pale.

To say the least, even if Ling Han himself did not make any movement, it was guaranteed that there would be a great many people that would move on his behalf to gain his favor. In front of over a dozen, or a few dozen Eternal River Tier-level forces, even if it was the Tong Clan, what would they be worth? It was assured that they would be exterminated in a single night.

With a flick of his sleeve, Yang Ming strode off.

On the other side, the friend that had initially warned Tong Yi also left, washing his hands of the matter. Previously, he had already done his utmost due by advising him. It was naturally impossible that he would die along with the Tong Clan.

“Seventh Great-grandfather, what should we do now?” Tong Wenzong asked Tong Yi, scowling miserably.

“What should we do? What should we do? How do I know what we should do!” Tong Yi suddenly exploded, and pelted a series of slaps right at Tong Wenzong. “You little bastard, if you want to die, just die on your own, why did you have to drag others into it!!”

Tong Wenzong also broke into tears. How could he possibly know that an impossibly young guy would actually be a Saint? Even the ancestor of their clan would have to kneel and greet him upon meeting him.

Yet Ling Han had completely forgotten this little intermission, traveling through the passage. When they reached a certain point, he felt his body become sluggish, as if he had passed through some kind of restriction barrier or something else.

In short, this heaven and earth became completely different.

What was most directly felt was the Spiritual Qi of this place. Its degree of density had increased more than 100 times. If one cultivated in this place, merely in terms of accumulating Origin Power, it would be indescribably fast. Even Saints would be able to benefit.

No wonder the Saints had not returned. As long as their accumulation of Origin Power had not reached the maximum level, the benefits of cultivating here were extremely large.

“Why is the Spiritual Qi here so dense?!” the Notionless Saint exclaimed in shock. “I have ventured to innumerable planets, but there is not one place that can compare to this place. This is really too astonishing.”

Even a veteran Saint like him would say that, which showed that the density of the Spiritual Qi here was indeed extraordinary.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded, and said, “If this place does not close up, one can completely reach the Great Saint Tier and then go out.”

Ling Han surveyed the surroundings. There were tall mountains everywhere in this place. They could not be seen clearly from outside, but one would immediately discover that these mountain peaks were so tall that there seemed to be no end in sight upon coming in. Even the vision of Saints like them could not see where they ended.

This was an extremely inconceivable matter. It should be known that if they spread out their divine sense, they could even envelop a whole planet, yet in this place, they could not even see the full appearance of a mountain peak.

“These mountains are not just tall and massive, there is also a mysterious power here that is blocking out divine sense,” the Notionless Saint said.

That was indeed the case. In here, their divine sense could not be spread over too widely. It was as if they had returned to the Shattering Void Tier, when the area their divine sense could spread over was only as large as a city.

The five of them rose into the air, attempting to look over the whole area from a higher position. However, when they had soared to a certain height, they discovered that there was a powerful energy pressing down on them, stopping them from continuing to fly higher.

Even if they were Saints, so what? They could only rise to about 1,000 miles in height. Ling Han could fly higher, and reach more than 3,000 miles, but compared to the height of this mountain range, that was completely negligible.

Needless to say, Long Xiangyue was even worse. About over 100 miles, she could no longer bear this pressure.

The five of them descended. After Ling Han, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the Notionless Saint exchanged looks, they could see a similar expression on each other’s faces.

“This should not have been a part of the Celestial Realm that has fallen, right?”

Aside from the Celestial Realm, what other place in the Ancient Realm could have such dense Spiritual Qi? Aside from the Celestial Realm, what other force could suppress Saints like them? During the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm, even Celestial Kings were battling furiously, so it seemed like there would be nothing strange if they struck off a mountain range of the Celestial Realm, which then fell into the Ancient Realm.

“Who knows, we may be able to gather a great many Saintly medicine here, there may even be Celestial medicine!” Ling Han’s eyes lit up. In the Celestial Realm, Saintly Material and Saintly medicine should not be nothing too rare, and with how big this area was, they might be able to return with great rewards.

“What Celestial Realm?” Long Yushan asked.

Ling Han paused for a moment, and then answered, “In this world of ours, there is a realm that is of a higher tier— err, that is not the right way to put it. The Celestial Realm is actually also a part of the Ancient Realm, so how should I explain it?”

He gathered his thoughts, and then related the origins of the Celestial Realm to the two women of the Long Tribe.

Long Yushan and Long Xiangyue were stunned speechless. This was a realm that they had never heard of before, and they were unable to accept it so quickly. However, would Ling Han deliberately tell such a lie?

Furthermore, the Spiritual Qi in this place was too dense, and there was no explanation for it at all. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Long Xiangyue suddenly stumbled, and Long Yushan hurriedly supported her, asking, “What is it?”

Could it be that suddenly finding out about the existence of the Celestial Realm, she had been so shocked that even her legs had become weak?

“The Spiritual Qi here is too strong; my body is feeling a little discomfort,” Long Xiangyue explained.
