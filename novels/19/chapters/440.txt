Chapter 441: Where Did She Experience the Dao Injury?

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“This is really troublesome. Then, after I reach the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, how many Stars of battle prowess would I have?” Ling Han scratched his head in wonder. With his current battle prowess, how many times would he be able to kill the Ling Han who was at this level in his last life?

“A thousand, or maybe ten thousand times.”

Ling Han could not help but think, how strong had Sword Emperor and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden been, then?

The problem was that though his ability to challenge a stronger person than himself was incredible, the price he had to pay was the slowing down of his cultivation rate. At the same time, for every step he took forward, the amount of Origin Power that he needed to accumulate could be several tens of times of any other person’s!

“Thankfully, I have an Immortal Grade Spirit Base, and am an alchemist as well. Otherwise, if I had to strengthen my foundations to such a strong, firm extent, I may not be able to reach the Flower Blossom Tier in this lifetime!” He shivered at the thought.

“Congratulations, Young Master Han!” When they saw Ling Han stand up, Liu Yu Tong and the others all offered him their congratulations.

Ling Han nodded and said, “You all must continue to persevere, and cannot fall too far behind me.”

“Yes!” Including Guang Yuan, they all nodded. If they were unable to help Ling Han by sharing his burdens and help him in times of difficulty, they’d lose face too. They would have gained so many benefits from Ling Han but done nothing in return for his great generosity.

All of them exited the Black Tower, and exactly one day had passed since they entered. The Marriage Tournament that the Jiang Clan was holding had yet to begin.

After a day, Zhu Xuan’er came, but her face was filled with disappointment. She said, “Grandmaster Ling, can you change your condition?” Obviously, the sect had rejected using an entry place to exchange for a Level Seven Spirit Grass.

It was not that a Level Seven Spirit Grass was not valuable enough, but rather that the uses for the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass were quite limited. Aside for being the main medicinal ingredient for a pill to heal one’s Spirit Base, it could only be a supplementary ingredient for the Hidden Tiger Heavenly Luck Pill. Thus, only when it encountered a person that needed it would this kind of Spirit Grass show its incredible value.

If it was capable of increasing one’s cultivation level at the Spiritual Infant Tier or increase one’s comprehension of the Dao of martial arts, just see if those old monsters of the Half Moon Sect would be so incredibly proactive.

Ling Han thought for a moment, then said, “All right, then I’ll exchange it for some information.”

Zhu Xuan’er was surprised. Mere information was enough to exchange for a Level Seven Spirit Grass? Previously, Ling Han had fought so fiercely with her over it, so this did not seem logical.

Could it be, that actually, he bore a fondness for her, and so used the means of letting the reins loose only to grip them better?

“May I ask, what does Grandmaster Ling want to know?” she asked.

“How did your master get injured?” Ling Han was very curious. Logically speaking, there could not possibly be any powerful ultimate cultivators of the Shattering Void Tier in the north region, but if it was not the action of an ultimate cultivator at the level of the Shattering Void Tier, how had one in Spiritual Infant Tier had his Dao wounded?

Anyways, he already had full confidence that he could get that key from the Jiang Clan, so he naturally no longer cared about getting an entry. He only hoped that the Jiang Clan’s key was not some other toy left from one of Jiang Yue Feng’s shenanigans. If that was the case, he’d really be horribly played by his own disciple.

Zhu Xuan’er could not resist a swift change in her expression. Even with a white silk veil covering half her face, the change in her eyes was still visible. After a while, she finally spoke, “My master... she discovered an ancient historical site. It was in the process of investigating it that she was wounded by the restrictions there.”

Ling Han clapped once and said, “So that was indeed the case!”

There were no Shattering Void Tier cultivators in the north region, so how could a powerful cultivator of the Spiritual Infant Tier experience a Dao injury? The only possibility left was being injured in an ancient historical site.

When she saw Ling Han’s excited expression, Zhu Xuan’er instantly felt displeased and said, “Grandmaster Ling, please show some respect to my master!”

Ling Han laughed, drew out a stalk of Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass and placed it on the table. He had long since harvested two stalks of Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass to prevent them bearing fruit which would make them unusable for medicine. The third stalk did bear fruit though, which he once again planted. In the future, three would become nine, nine would become twenty-seven, and soon enough, he would have overwhelming numbers of this particular Spirit Grass.

Zhu Xuan’er’s beautiful eyes immediately lit up, and she stretched out a hand to take it.

Ling Han raised his right hand, which caused her hand to miss its target.

“Grandmaster Ling, what is the meaning of this?”

Ling Han placed the stalk of the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass back onto the table and asked, “Where is that ancient historical site?”

Zhu Xuan’er hesitated slightly, but when she recalled that even her master incurred a Dao injury within, it was obvious that no matter how big the fateful opportunity there was within, it was not to be hers nor her master’s. Thus, she answered decisively, “Agriculture Enclosed Mountain, Eaglewood Valley.”

Ling Han nodded and raised his hand, leaving the stalk of Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass on the table.

Zhu Xuan’er hurriedly stored the Spirit Grass into her Spatial Ring and, looking overjoyed, said, “Many thanks, Grandmaster Ling!”

Ling Han flicked his hand in response and said, “You may go.”

Zhu Xuan’er’s face could not help but twitch. How displeased was he to see her that he would actually attempt to chase her off? Yet, of all things, that apathetic attitude did not seem faked, which made her even more depressed.

...Women were really weird. Just now, she had misunderstood that Ling Han bore a fondness for her and was worried that Ling Han would do something to her, and now that Ling Han paid absolutely no regard for her, she was depressed.

Ai!

She was a bit irritated internally and asked, “Grandmaster Ling is probably getting ready to become the ideal son-in-law of the Jiang Clan, right?” Otherwise, Ling Han would not have changed his condition and easily handed the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass to her.

Ling Han laughed and countered, “So what if I am? Jealous?”

In your dreams! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhu Xuan’er merely humphed lightly and said, “In the Marriage Tournament the Jiang Clan is holding this time, not only will the top ten members of the Prodigy Roll participate, even the elites from the last few Prodigy Rolls would appear. Though they all have yet to break through to the Flower Blossom Tier, their ability is still outstanding. Perhaps some might even have reached the level of having half a foot into the Flower Blossom Tier.”

Ling Han merely smiled. His current ability probably reached the level of having half a foot into the Flower Blossom Tier, and in future, he would possibly get endlessly nearer the Flower Blossom Tier. So what if there appeared some cultivators at this level, he’d still thrash them as per usual!

Zhu Xuan’er’s beautiful eyes turned. She suddenly asked, “Does Grandmaster Ling want to see Xuan’er’s real appearance?”

What the hell was that?

Ling Han looked at her in surprise, but Zhu Xuan’er merely smiled slightly, stood up and left, saying, “Whenever Xuan’er is in a better mood, who knows, I may allow Grandmaster Ling a glimpse at my true face.”

After saying so, she left with a twist of her slender waist, incredibly graceful in her movements.

Little demon!

Even if Ling Han had his whole heart and soul focused on martial arts, when he saw her captivating rear view, powerful desire rose within him. He felt an impulse to rush out and push her down onto the ground, then ***, and ***.

He hurriedly restrained his mind. Who said that a quiet, elegant woman did not know the art of seduction? On the contrary, when one who normally assumed a serious, refined manner, then suddenly showed a flirtatious expression, that would only be even more alluring.

Indeed, every beauty was transformed from a vixen, and it only depended on whether she wanted to use her seductive charms or not.

Another day passed, and the Marriage Tournament of the Jiang Clan had officially begun.

Ling Han brought Liu Yu Tong and the others to watch the excitement. Anyways, the tournament would be held for three days, so there was no need for him to participate right at this very moment. It would not be too late even if he waited until the third day. Furthermore, he would be taking part as “Han Lin”, and would run the moment he got the key. As for the Jiang Clan, he would have compensation for them in future.

“Is there still any need to compete? It would definitely be the first place of the Prodigy Roll, Yang Jun Hao. He has defeated all the young elites of the north region.”

“Hehe, the tournament is a tournament, but now, there is no restriction on using any kind of Spirit Tool, so every person’s battle prowess would be greatly different. Furthermore, before ascending the tournament stage, there is a need to first sign a life or death agreement. That would be a battle to the death. A battle to the death is completely different from mere sparring.”

“In addition, the young male elites who have matured may also participate. Should Yang Jun Hao want to carry off the beautiful maiden as he hoped, it would be difficult!”

“That’s right. This Marriage Tournament would definitely be even more exciting than the Prodigy Tournament.”

The Jiang Clan rented a site on the Great Arena for the Marriage Tournament, and the Spirit Treasures Pavilion also took advantage of the opportunity to earn additional profit. Whether one entered the site as a spectator or as a participant, they would need to pay a single Origin Crystal.

Ling Han paid the entrance fee and entered to watch the tournament.

There was indeed nothing much notable about the battles on the first day. Most of the participants were those that had not managed to make it onto the Prodigy Roll and were here to show off some of their skill to make their presence known. And it was precisely because of this that the Jiang Clan and the Spirit Treasures Pavilion worked together to change the rules of the tournament stage.
