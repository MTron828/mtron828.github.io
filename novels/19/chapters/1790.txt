Chapter 1791: Persuasion

Previously, no one had thought that Ling Han was a king tier among king tiers.

Because none of the people gathered here could accept this.

Oh, they, Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, heirs of three-star forces, had only achieved a flawless severance, yet a country bumpkin from a subordinate force was actually capable of striking the heaven and earth. This was something that could not be accepted by the pride of every king tier.

Though they were stunned by how strong Ling Han was, they still continued to find other reasons for it, such as if Ling Han had taken some “forbidden medicine”, or drawn on the power of some kind of powerful Pseudo-Celestial Tool, or used Celestial Seals, or something of the sort.

Only when Luo Changfeng showed his might did they face up to the reason of striking the heaven and earth.

For the Holy Son of a five-star sect, wasn’t it very ordinary for him to have successfully struck the heaven and earth? Though this was something that everyone envied, it was not something that they could not accept. It also allowed them to turn around to look at Ling Han. Perhaps this was also a freak that had struck the heaven and earth to become a Celestial.

They had both struck the heaven and earth, but one was the Holy Son of a five-star sect, while the other was an unknown character. The difference in difficulty level could be imagined.

Ling Han was definitely even more freakish!

However, if they were asked to bet on who would be the victor in a battle between Ling Han and Luo Changfeng, it was definite that everyone would still place their bet on Luo Changfeng. Even if Luo Changfeng and Ling Han fought on equal cultivation level, at least 90 percent of the people here would still bet on Luo Changfeng.

Why?

The answer was very simple. That was because Luo Changfeng was the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier force!

Could the celestial techniques that Ling Han grasped compare to his?

They both had the same basis, so the competition would be in celestial techniques, and Ling Han naturally would be completely defeated.

Furthermore, Luo Changfeng was a Divine Fetus, a Natural Lightning Physique, and using the power of the Divine Fetus, he could be even stronger.

This was what being invincible among peers truly meant!

Even if Bewitching Maiden Rou admitted that Ling Han’s inventiveness and comprehension ability was stronger, in a battle of equals, it was still Luo Changfeng who would win.

Perhaps only that Zihe Bingyun by his side could be a match for him. As she was similarly an heir of a Celestial King Tier force, her status was equal to the Holy Son’s.

Luo Changfeng and Beiyu Xiong fought fiercely. One had the advantage in cultivation level, while the other was a king among kings that had struck the heaven and earth, and it was hard to distinguish who was stronger in battle prowess. After fighting for about seven minutes, Luo Changfeng suddenly showed his might.

He had used the power of the Divine Fetus!

Why could he become the Holy Son of the Thundercloud Palace?

That was because he had a Natural Lightning Physique. By birth, he was suited to cultivating the celestial techniques of Thundercloud Palace. And on the other side, the cultivation techniques of the Thundercloud Palace could only be fully unleashed with his power as a Divine Fetus.

“Thunder God Overflow!” Luo Changfeng roared loudly, and his whole person actually enlarged a hundred times over, turning into a half-naked hideous giant. His whole body was purple in color and entwined with endless purple divine lightning.

He lowered a finger, and aimed directly at Beiyu Xiong.

Even though this was just a single finger, his present size was really too big. One finger was equivalent to a smashing stone pillar, as if even the dome of the heavens could be pierced through.

Beiyu Xiong was shocked. Having been locked on, he no longer had the time to dodge. He could only fully activate his physique of a Blood Crow. Endless bloody light surged out of his body, turning into a long blood-colored spear. He was planning to fight attack with attack.

This was the faith of a king tier. What they would always think of was how they were to defeat their opponent, and not how they would have to resign themselves to their fates.

Peng!

The finger descended, and it was like even the heavens were crushed.

Beiyu Xiong instantly spat out a mouthful of blood, his whole person sent more than 100 miles backwards. While he soared through the air, the feathers of his wings were still dancing wildly. When he stopped, his feathers had also shattered completely, and he looked incredibly battered.

His figure swayed dangerously, his face as pale as paper.

Luo Changfeng’s face was also slightly pale. A blood spear had stabbed his chest, but it was only the body of lightning that he had formed with his Divine Fetus. The damage it inflicted on him was not very serious, actually. At least, he was much better off than Beiyu Xiong.

“Hoho, this battle can be considered a tie,” he said smilingly, appearing to be calm and humble as he flew back onto the ship’s deck.

To him, being able to force a king tier to this point even with a gap of a minor level was already enough. Furthermore, could it be that everyone could not see with their own eyes who was stronger and who was weaker?

Thus, there was no need for him to take all the limelight, and completely obliterate his opponent.

“Holy Son Changfeng is mighty, I admit that I am no match!” Beiyu Xiong also shot back. His expression was filled with admiration. Though king tiers had their pride and arrogance, they similarly admired true strength.

Luo Changfeng was indeed very strong, and he had to concede that.

“As expected of Holy Son Changfeng!”

“Too powerful; no wonder he can become the Holy Son of a five-star sect.”

The others all nodded, not hiding the admiration they felt towards Luo Changfeng in the slightest. Even Bewitching Maiden Rou’s gaze was a little enchanted as Luo Changfeng’s heroic figure had barged into her heart. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Though Ling Han was very strong, he had not defeated a fourth severance elite, and even if he could, that was not a king tier among fourth severance, either—even if Qianzhao Yuan’s battle prowess was not actually much inferior as compared to Beiyu Xiong’s.

Xiu, a figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It was precisely Ling Han, and he bore a smile on his face, clearly being in a good mood

That was because he had just put away quite a few pieces of Pseudo-Divine Metal into the Black Tower.

“Ling Han!” When everyone saw him, only then did they remember that there was another battle that was ongoing. But since Ling Han had already appeared, could it be...

They hurriedly looked towards the chessboard, and true enough, Qianzhao Yuan was already sprawled out, one side of his body frozen in cold ice, while the other side was roasted and charred, appearing incredibly bizarre.

...Taking advantage of the opening created when everyone’s attention was focused on Beiyu Xiong and Luo Changfeng, Ling Han used the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water, and finally defeated Qianzhao Yuan. He did not worry that the latter would leak the secret, either, because he would be unconscious for eight to 10 years at least, and by the time he regained consciousness, the venture into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm would have long since ended.

Ling Han’s target was the Western Celestial Realm. He would not be staying here for very long. Thus, even if others found out that he had grasped extremely strong Regulations of Fire and Water, so what?

Ling Han looked towards Luo Changfeng. Though he had been in the world of the chessboard, his sight and hearing had not been disconnected from the outside world. It had only shrunk his body a great many times, and the waves created by the battle would not seep out, either.

Thus, he was aware of the appearance of Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun.

Though everyone glanced at Ling Han, they immediately withdrew their gaze. At this point, they would no longer feel jealous, because no one could compete against Luo Changfeng, after all, right? Since that was the case, why should they bother with Ling Han then?

Luo Changfeng was like the moon which the stars revolved around. Multiple king tiers surrounded him, and even a great bringer of calamity like Bewitching Maiden Rou consulted him about cultivation in a reserved manner. It was probable that Luo Changfeng only had to spare a little more effort; the possibility of him winning this femme fatale was very high.

After all, he had the name of a Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier sect and the might of an invincible king tier. There was practically no way he would fail in courting a woman.

“Husband, you have to work harder.” The Empress arrived at Ling Han’s side.

‘What?!’

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head, and asked, “You still haven’t dismissed that idea?”

“This person is very likely to become a strong rival for you!” The Empress looked at Luo Changfeng. “If he was allowed to get hold of the Nine Revolutions Charm Physique, he would leave you behind in his dust in terms of cultivation level.”

By that time, even if Ling Han was able to become more invincible among his peers than Luo Changfeng, so what? There would still be a gap of quite a few cultivation levels between them, and the latter would be able to crush him with a single finger.

The prerequisite of being invincible among one’s peers was based on the speed of one’s advancement through the cultivation levels.

Otherwise, every three-star force had characters that were invincible in the Severing Mundane Tier, but could they focus their resources on these people?

“That’s right!” Small Tower actually piped up as well. “A Celestial King Tier sect must have something like a treasured tool to speed up the passage of time. Even if it cannot compare to the Reincarnation Tree, it would also shrink your advantage countless times over.”
