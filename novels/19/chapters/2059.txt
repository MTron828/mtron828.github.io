Chapter 2060: Azure Dragon Town

There were a considerable number of people in the small town. Some had the head of a dragon with the body of a human, and some had a dragon’s body with a human head, but no matter their appearance, their hair was all lush green.

And in this town, the Regulations of gravity had actually vanished.

“Please come with me,” the dragon-headed man leading them said again, guiding Ling Han and his party into the town.

The entry of four outsiders did not cause any commotion. The townspeople were still doing whatever they were doing, looking like they did not realize that a few “monsters” had come here.

They walked all the way to the town square. There was a temple made completely out of logs here, with a green dragon sculpture at the very top. It extended all the way across the entire temple, its dragon whiskers incredibly realistic, as if they were still fluttering as a breeze passed over them.

“Please.” The dragon-headed man continued to lead the way, bringing Ling Han and his group to the atrium inside the temple. He finally stopped here. “Please sit for a while, and allow me to ask the elder to come out.”

Ling Han and the others were completely baffled. They had been brought here by someone they did not know, and he did not even explain anything. Anyone would be completely confused and befuddled.

After a while, the dragon-headed man from before returned, but there was an elder following behind him now.

This elder had a human head with a dragon’s body. His head was bald, so there was no green on his head, but his brows and beard were still green. There seemed to be no escape from the fate of being lush green in color.

“I am Na Xu.” A smile appeared on the elder’s face, his eyes radiant with light, exuding a frightening pressure.

This was an elite, probably an Ascending Origin Tier existence. Ling Han could just vaguely estimate it.

“Greetings, Senior.” Ling Han and the others all bowed in greeting.

Na Xu raised a hand, and said, “It is once again the time for the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm to open. I have been waiting a very long time for this day.”

“Dare I ask, why has Senior summoned us here?” Ling Han asked.

Na Xu was just about to speak when another old monk walked over. Immediately, his brow wrinkled in a frown.

“Amitabha Buddha!” this old monk chanted, and everyone felt their ears vibrate strongly with the chant, and almost passed out.

This old monk was also very powerful.

“I am Na Kong.” The second old monk smiled at Ling Han and his party. “I wish to ask for good karma from you four benefactors[1].”

“Four benefactors, it would be better to form this good karma with me!” Na Xu hurriedly spoke up, looking like it would be his loss if he did not speak up.

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks, even more confused. What on earth was going on here?

“If you form this good karma with me, I can help increase the benefits threefold when you get instilled with power by the 100 dragons,” Na Kong said.

“I promise you that I can increase it fourfold!” Na Xu was unwilling to back down as well.

“Fivefold!”

“Sixfold!”

The two old monks suddenly argued so intensely that their faces and ears were flushed, almost coming to blows.

Ling Han and the others were even more confused. Were they having an internal conflict?

“Dare I ask, Seniors, what exactly is this good karma?” Ling Han asked.

As the two elderly monks continued their argument, they were also explaining to Ling Han. They would be arguing for three lines, and then insert a single line of explanation, and with such scattered words of explanation put together, Ling Han and his party finally found out what was going on.

This small town was called Azure Dragon Town, and everyone here had the bloodline of the Dragon Tribe. However, they had been trapped for generations on this Divine Dragon Mountain, and could not leave.

No one knew the reason. Anyways, the moment they descended the mountain, their cultivation would be completely lost, which would be quickly followed by their lifespan running out and death from old age.

There was only a single solution, and that was when the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm opened every 100,000,000 years.

There were a total of seven clans in the Azure Dragon Town, and when the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm was open, these seven great clans would enter into a contest with one another. Whoever attained the first place would be able to obtain a Dragon Pearl from the Divine Dragon Temple. When they collected 9,999 Dragon Pearls, they would then be able to summon the Divine Dragon, and bring their whole clan safely out of the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm[2].

Yet the candidates for the contest had to be outsiders.

Thus, it had led to the previous argument between Na Xu and Na Kong. The so-called good karma was signing an agreement with the clan they were in, and fighting on their behalf in this period of time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As time passed, the number of Dragon Pearls collected by the seven great clans was getting closer and closer to the required number, but the number of Dragon Pearls collected by the clans that Na Xu and Na Kong belonged to was the least. Thus, they were also the most anxious, being in urgent need of winning so that they could catch up with the other five great clans ahead of them.

What they feared was if there was just this one opportunity to leave.

No one wanted to be trapped eternally on this Divine Dragon Mountain.

Na Xu and Na Kong both put out very high offers, hoping that Ling Han and his group could join the clan they were in—no matter how strong Ling Han and his group were, one additional person meant additional power.

Ling Han did not agree rashly, but rather chose to wait and see. He could not just agree rashly just by hearing some words from them.

What if this contest was incredibly dangerous, and people would easily die?

Whatever the case, he had to get a full understanding first.

Though Na Kong and Na Xu were both very anxious, they could not do anything. They could only arrange accommodations for the four of them. However, they each sent out a representative from their clans that could speak well, and would continue to convince Ling Han and his group.

All the outsiders had been arranged accommodations inside the Divine Temple. There was an extremely large courtyard that was especially built to accommodate them. Using Regulations of Space, it might not look large from the outside, but was a completely different world on the inside.

Thus, from the outside, it looked like there were doors built into a wall, and appeared very close together, and also seemed extremely ugly.

There were a great many people standing outside, discussing something with one another.

“Newcomers?” Someone spotted Ling Han.

“Newcomer, come here!” a purple-robed young man immediately shouted at Ling Han and his group, bearing a strong tone of command.

Ling Han only glanced at him, and asked, “Have your parents not taught you how to speak?”

Immediately, the purple-robed young man’s eyes were spitting fire, and he looked like he was about to charge at Ling Han.

“Brother Bao, calm down! Calm down!” Someone on the sidelines hurriedly played mediator, grabbing tightly onto the purple-robed young man.

“Let me go, I am going to teach this guy a lesson!” The purple-robed young man struggled strongly, looking like he was fuming with rage.

Ling Han chuckled, and clenching his right hand into a fist, he shot out a punch at the empty air in front of him.

Peng, endless Regulations moved, dazzling the universe.

After this strike, everyone slanted a glance at Ling Han.

‘So powerful!’

He was clearly only at Yang Soul, but his battle prowess was actually so strong that it had reached the peak stage of Earth Soul! No, it might have even reached the level of Heaven Soul, the early stage of Heaven Soul.

Meanwhile, the purple-robed young man’s mouth was gaping widely. However, he could not make a single sound, his expression slightly amusing.

“L-let me go, let me go!” After being stunned for a while, he called out again.

The person beside him expressed that he was very innocent. That was because he had forgotten to hold the purple-robed young man in his shock. Thus, why was he still saying “let me go”?

Clearly, the purple-robed young man had gotten a scare from Ling Han, but if he were to give in now, it would be embarrassing, so he could only continue calling out and make it an act.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and waved his fist at the purple-robed young man.

“Brother!” The purple-robed young man immediately pounced over, and grabbed Ling Han’s fist. “You are my dear brother, and your little brother, I, have finally found you!” His expression was filled with excitement.

F***, this guy was a little too shameless, wasn’t he?

Ling Han shook his head, and asked, “What did you call me over for?”

“Er, brother, we plan to all join a single clan. That way, we will be able to easily obtain victory, and will not have any loss.” The purple-robed young man wore an ingratiating expression.

[2] This is really reminiscent of Dragon Balls, lol.
