Chapter 2579: Fourth Heaven Celestial King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han faced off against heavenly tribulation. At the same time, his divine sense also underwent a dramatic change.

His Celestial Seed was undergoing a fourth transformation.

Heavenly tribulation boomed, its might astounding. Such was its sheer ferocity that even with Ling Han’s physique, he still became riddled with wounds. The might of this heavenly tribulation had definitely reached the Seventh Heaven. Otherwise, it couldn’t have wounded Ling Han.

However, the more powerful this tribulation was, the more delighted Ling Han would be.

After all, as long as he could endure it without dying, his cultivation would definitely rise at a rapid rate. Heavenly tribulation provided the purest of energy; this was the most suitable nutrient for his Celestial Seed.

Inside his mind, the Celestial Tree had already sprouted. In this fourth transformation, it was growing from a bud into a sapling.

Nearby, Luo Fuming wore a deep frown.

Ling Han was only advancing to the Fourth Heaven, so why did the might of his tribulation rival that of his when he had advanced to the Seventh Heaven?

Just what kind of freak was he? He could already rival the Seventh Heaven while at the Fourth Heaven?

Most importantly, Ling Han still hadn’t died!

Back then, Luo Fuming hadn’t done much better. He had been fortunate enough to endure the tribulation, yet he had been left with a great number of wounds. He had only been a hair away from death’s door.

This was inconceivable, unfathomable! This young man was an absolute freak!

However, enduring the tribulation would definitely exhaust his vitality. Moreover, Luo Fuming was already at the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven, so trying to suppress someone who was equivalent in power to him at the early stage of the Seventh Heaven would naturally be a simple task, especially since this person was also severely wounded.

Moreover, the more freakish Ling Han was, the more treasures he would naturally possess.

Luo Fuming could barely conceal his greed. Because of this opportunity, perhaps he would be able to rapidly soar into the sky. Tang Mingbo and the Azure Ghost Celestial King? They would only be worthy to prostrate before him!

Boom!

Heavenly tribulation continued its wanton punishment of Ling Han. The closer his cultivation edged to the limit of heaven and earth, the more violent the reaction from heaven and earth. Heaven and earth did all in its power to prevent him from reaching a new height.

However, Ling Han was brimming with confidence. In his mind, the Celestial Seed was steadily growing, already producing two healthy leaves. This was delightful progress.

He hoped to take a step forward after overcoming heavenly tribulation.

Even though this was only a single step, if he treated it like normal, it would require him hundreds of millions or even tens of billions of years to complete.

Time flew by, and Luo Fuming sat cross-legged in waiting. He was resting and adjusting himself to his peak condition. He desired to slay Ling Han with his peak battle prowess. Otherwise, he was afraid that someone with a powerful background such as Ling Han might possess some devastating trump cards.

One day… quickly passed by.

Heavenly tribulation also drew to an end. Following the last bolt of lightning, the dark clouds in the sky dissipated as if they had never existed in the first place.

Boom!

A terrifying attack surged over, shattering the surrounding space and drowning the void with arcs of lightning, and transforming it into a sea of crackling energy.

‘Heavenly tribulation again?

‘No!’

This was the doing of Luo Fuming. He had surprisingly cultivated the Great Dao of Lightning, so the attacks that he unleashed were much like a return of heavenly tribulation.

Ling Han roared and replied with a punch.

Peng!

He was instantly sent flying back. However, Luo Fuming also shuddered, surprisingly unable to charge forward and press his advantage.

A smile tugged at the corners of Ling Han’s lips. With a single exchange, he had already gained a deep understanding of his opponent’s battle prowess.

He had just advanced to the Fourth Heaven, yet his Vitality Index had already soared to over 10,000. Meanwhile, even though Luo Fuming was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, his talent wasn’t great, so he was only an emperor tier at most. It was thanks to the fact that he was already at the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven that his Vitality Index had reached over 11,000.

In the outside world, it was simply impossible for emperor tiers to become Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings. Here, however, the existence of the Ascending Dragon Pill transformed the impossible into possible.

There was a gulf between them in terms of battle prowess, though this didn’t lead to a one-sided battle.

With a shake, Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. His wounds from the tribulation healed at a rapid speed.

Heavenly tribulation was fairly good in this sense. It was terrifying when it attacked, but as long as one could overcome it, they wouldn’t suffer any Dao injuries.

Luo Fuming was transfixed with shock upon seeing this. Ling Han’s battle prowess had already been astonishingly powerful, yet his recovery ability was also this freakish?

Was he truly human?

He gritted his teeth. Regardless of whether it was to avenge his son or for his own greed, he definitely couldn’t give up now.

‘Die!’

He unleashed attack after attack. No matter what, he still possessed an absolute advantage in terms of battle prowess. If it really came to it, he would simply expend some more energy to conclude the battle. After all, could a Seventh Heaven Celestial King not dispose of a newly advanced Fourth Heaven Celestial King?

At this moment, Tang Yuan also arrived. He had gotten lost just then, but the violent attacks of heavenly tribulation had pointed him back in the right direction again.

Not only he, but his underlings were also present. However, there were only seven remaining.

Their jaws fell to the ground in unison when they saw Ling Han battling against Luo Fuming. In fact, their mouths opened and closed as if they were fish out of water.

This was simply inconceivable.

A Fourth Heaven Celestial King could be this freakishly powerful?

However, regardless of how powerful Ling Han was, it was only a matter of time before he was killed.

Tang Yuan and the others all shook their heads. It was clear that Ling Han’s battle prowess was inferior. However, he still insisted on facing Luo Fuming head-on. If he wasn’t killed, would there still be reason in this world?

Celestial Kings were indeed difficult to kill, and this was because they could flee quickly. However, with Celestial Kings like Ling Han, who only battled head-on with no regard for anything else, it would be rather strange if they didn’t wound up dead.

“Die, die, die!” Luo Fuming roared as he wielded a sea of Celestial Lightning. He yearned to immediately blast Ling Han into ashes.

However, Ling Han’s defenses were rock-solid. Even though he suffered more and more wounds, and even though these wounds also became increasingly severe, he still continued to battle. At the same time, his counterattacks also remained precise and deadly.

Ling Han was pushing himself. He still had trump cards such as the Divine Demon Sword, and he could still elevate his Body Art once he uncapped the limit on his cultivation.

However, he didn’t rely on any of these things. Instead, he continued to exchange blows with Luo Fuming using the power of Regulations. He wanted to stabilize his cultivation and raise his potential.

However, this resulted in his wounds becoming increasingly severe. He flirted with death time and time again, yet it was during these moments of peril that he also attained endless enlightenment. He was confident that this battle would greatly aid the growth of his battle prowess.

The problems brought about by his rapid rise in cultivation level would most likely be resolved. It was very likely that he wouldn’t be at risk of having a mental state that couldn’t keep up with his cultivation level.

“Cease your futile struggle! I’ll grant you a swift death!” Luo Fuming roared with a humph. He was astonished and alarmed by Ling Han’s stubbornness.

Once this young person took another step forward, he would definitely become powerful enough to rival him.

Ling Han’s wounds were severe. One of his arms had already been broken, and there was also a gaping wound in his abdomen, almost piercing through his entire body. His left foot was crippled, and his right foot had more so disappeared. At this moment, he was completely drenched in blood.

He panted like an old bull, and his flame of life flickered as if it were about to be extinguished at any moment.

Even though his recovery ability was astonishing, his opponent’s attacks were even more powerful. He was slowly but surely being dragged to the abyss of death.

He was done for. At this moment, he was truly done for.

Tang Yuan watched on, unsure of what to feel.

On the one hand, he wanted to kill Ling Han, this “traitorous subject” who dared to threaten him. On the other hand, he also wanted to rely on Ling Han to help him seek revenge and gather wealth. As such, he was filled with conflicting emotions.

However, things were much simpler for the others. They resented Ling Han for snatching away Tang Yuan’s “favor,” so they naturally wanted Ling Han to die.

“Die!” Luo Fuming said with a sneer. He summoned a blade of lightning, thrusting forth and yearning to penetrate Ling Han’s chest with a single strike. Under the ferocious power of lightning, Ling Han’s vitality would be instantly extinguished.

However, a smile spread across Ling Han’s face as he finally unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword. He couldn’t play around any longer. Otherwise, this would no longer be a process of tempering himself. It would be an act of seeking death.
