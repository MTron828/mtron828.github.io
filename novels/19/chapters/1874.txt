Chapter 1875: Breaking through!

However, Ling Han sighed. Zhao Qingfeng was not dead.

He had indeed sustained severe injuries, but at the last crucial moment, a powerful figure had interfered and saved him.

The elder with a tall build turned to Ling Han, and said, “Brat, don’t be disappointed. I am saving you here. If you had killed a member of the Eternal Prosperity Sect, there would’ve been no place for you to hide in this whole wide world!”

‘You are an elite, so whatever you say.’

Ling Han bowed slightly, and said, “Milord speaks true.” In any case, he did not cultivate the Regulation of Slaughter. He had accumulated boundless appreciation through this battle, and once he had completely digested this, he would have a chance of advancing into the fourth severance.

As for Zhao Qingfeng... en, when he left the city, he would find a chance to kill him.

“In this battle, Ling Han is victorious!” this tall, broad elder announced.

This process of turning the tide had happened too quickly, and everyone had a slight difficulty in accepting this turn of events. Wasn’t it Zhao Qingfeng who still had the absolute upper hand? Why had he lost all of a sudden? However, since this was personally announced by this powerful figure, who would dare express disagreement?

Those who had placed bets all sighed. All of them had placed their bets on Zhao Qingfeng’s victory, and the only difference was how many moves it would take, but now the result was so beyond expectations.

One could only say that the gamble house had turned over a great profit.

Everyone left gradually, and those like Sun Dong and Cheng Fengyun were at a loss. Even now, they had not come back to their senses.

Why was it Ling Han that had won?

Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden finally released the breath that she was holding. She could feel that her whole body was covered with sweat, her face astonishingly pale.

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou humphed. This damn man was clearly very strong, yet caused her to worry so long for nothing. He really was despicable!

Ling Han left, yet he had just barely walked out when he was met with a familiar face.

“Brother Ling, I never thought I would actually see you here!” Lu Xianming laughed loudly.

Sun Dong who was following behind him shivered in fear. Only now did he realize what a big mistake he had previously made.

As it turned out, Lu Xianming and Ling Han knew each other.

No wonder Lu Xianming would be displeased about him, and the crux of the matter lay here.

His heart clenched, and he instantly thought of a measure to make up for it. He hurriedly shot out quickly, bowed deeply towards Ling Han, and said, “Brother Ling, I have previously offended you greatly. That was out of my own foolishness, and I hope Brother Ling would forgive me!”

A sliver of a smile flashed across Lu Xianming’s face. This subordinate was not too bad. He had taken the initiative to admit his error, and had given Ling Han enough face. Lu Xianming was sure that Ling Han would be very pleased.

Ling Han, on the other hand, did not think too much of it. Sun Dong had come to provoke him, and he had punished the former for it too, so he had long since forgotten about it—unless Sun Dong did something again. Ling Han thus waved a hand dismissively, and said, “I have already forgotten.”

Forgotten? Forgotten naturally meant that it was all water under the bridge.

Only now did Sun Dong sigh in relief. He stole a glance at Lu Xianming, and seeing a smile appear on the latter’s face, he knew that he had done the right thing.

“Brother Lu.” Ling Han also raised his clasped hands in greeting towards Lu Xianming.

“Come, let’s continue the conversation after we return,” Lu Xianming said smilingly.

“There’s no rush. I still have a companion,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

“Yo, just one? Then what about me?” Bewitching Maiden Rou walked over with swaying hips, and even if Lu Xianming had strong self-control against feminine charms, he couldn’t help but look stunned. Even less needed to be said about Sun Dong. He had a fondness for women, so how could he possibly resist Bewitching Maiden Rou’s charms?

Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stood beside Bewitching Maiden Rou, and immediately paled in comparison. As far as Ling Han knew, there were only two others that could emerge superior over Bewitching Maiden Rou—the Empress and Hu Niu.

Ling Han sighed. ‘What are you playing at, you witch? Are you really planning to deliver the Nine Revolutions Charm Physique for my cultivation?’

“Heh, since you are Brother Ling’s friends, then let’s go together,” Lu Xianming said with a smile, though light flickered in the gaze he directed at Bewitching Maiden Rou.

He had the confidence to capture this seductive witch for himself.

...Who was he? A young master of Alchemy City, and very soon he would advance, and would become the future master of Alchemy City.

And that was still not enough to make this delicate woman throw herself into his arms?

Ling Han?

Ling Han was indeed very strong, but this was Alchemy City. No matter how strong you were, you would only be a hired thug. Moreover, just how far was the Severing Mundane Tier from Ascending Origin Tier? At least in the future billions and billions of years, Ling Han only had potential.

Hearing Lu Xianming say thus, Ling Han could not refuse, either. He only beckoned Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden over, and wrapped an arm around her slender waist, which calmed Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s heart greatly.

There were thousands of years of affection between herself and Ling Han!

Lu Xianming saw this, and naturally was even more certain in his heart. Though he did not know why Ling Han was not interested in Bewitching Maiden Rou, what did that have to do with him?

The group arrived at Lu Xianming’s courtyard, and arrangements for the accommodations of Ling Han and his group were made first. Then, everyone sat in the center of a garden, with fine wine served to them. Sipping wine, they conversed idly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lu Xianming’s main focus was naturally recruiting Ling Han, but he did not have any position to do so at present. You see, he had first wanted to save Ling Han, yet had missed the chance, leading to the situation now in which he still owed Ling Han his life. How could he bring himself to speak of recruitment?

Then they’d just start from being friends.

He was the Holy Son of Alchemy City, and with his invitation, Lu Xianming naturally did not need to be concerned about the rules of the fourth level. Ling Han could stay however many days he wanted—as long as Lu Xianming did not throw him out.

On the second day, the Dao Regulating Pill was delivered.

Ling Han did not consume it, but rather handed it over to the Empress.

There were really too many treasures he had. Even the majority of Celestial Kings would be bloodshot with envy about the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water. In comparison, the Empress’s foundations were much weaker.

And they had also been gained with the support of Small Tower. By now, only precious treasures like the Heavenly Dao Jade could be of any help to Ling Han. The Dao Regulating Pill was really not enough.

...In the case of the Heavenly Dao Jade, he could only refine it after he had reached about the fourth severance peak stage. Otherwise, it would only make up for the shortcomings in his previous path of cultivation, but could not help one to attempt the fifth severance.

The Empress naturally would not be reserved with Ling Han. Initially, she still needed some time to break through to the fourth severance, but with the Dao Regulating Pill, she would definitely be able to break through in a shorter period of time.

Ling Han was the same. He had really gained much from his battle with Zhao Qingfeng, and he himself had reached the third severance peak stage. After this battle, he had reached a state of perfection, and immediately entered into seclusion to begin his breakthrough to the fourth severance.

This disappointed Lu Xianming slightly. He was still hoping to form amicable relations with Ling Han.

In his eyes, attempting the fourth severance was definitely something that would take a long time, and without over 10,000 years, one shouldn’t even think of succeeding.

Never mind. Their lifespan was unlimited now, so if he had to wait 10,000 years, then so be it.

Inside the Black Tower, Ling Han sat down cross-legged underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

The fourth severance was already within sight, and he only had to complete the final dash.

The battle with Zhao Qingfeng continuously flashed through his mind, and Ling Han picked out the shortcomings that he had observed. All these needed to be improved on, and the experience that came from battle caused him to rise to a higher level.

Underneath the Reincarnation Tree, one day was equivalent to 100 years.

Even if Ling Han had already seen hope, he had still stayed in the Black Tower for a whole two months, and only then did he finally sense the turning point for his breakthrough.

When he stood up, the Empress, too, opened her eyes.

Her breakthrough was similarly in sight.

The two of them exited the Black Tower, their figures stepping on air, and arriving at a desolate mountain. Then, they released their auras. Suddenly, tribulation clouds rolled out, enshrouding the air above them respectively, which was incredibly frightening.

“I, f***, is there something wrong with you people!” At this moment, a naked mad suddenly popped out of the wilderness. As he stopped in fury, he rapidly threw on some clothing, and there were actually two other women beside him. They similarly were quickly putting on their clothes.

They just happened to be having a romp in the wild.
