2858 Arrogant attitude

Initially, Bao Fengyu had hoped that he would be able to turn the whole situation around with the last raw stone, yet reality struck him a heavy blow. It was actually a scrap stone. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Originally, this would be very normal. Even a grandmaster of raw stone could not guess accurately every time. However, he had his heart set on turning this defeat into victory, yet could not even glimpse the slightest bit of hope, so how could he not feel dejected?

That Heavenly Venerate from before continued the stonecutting. Actually, this was a very strong feeling of accomplishment to personally unearth a rare treasure. Even a Heavenly Venerate would be emotionally moved. Though he had already opened one, he did not mind opening another.

“Yi!” He soon exclaimed in surprise because he could already see a slight part of the form inside.

“What is it?” the people around him all asked.

“Strange,” he murmured to himself.

Everyone was extremely curious. ‘Just what is strange? Can’t you just say it directly?’

That Heavenly Venerate continued opening the stone. With how strong his power was, the layers of stone turned to dust and fluttered down with a rub of his hand, soon revealing the object that lay within.

“This…” Everyone had a strange expression. It was no wonder that the Heavenly Venerate would feel it was strange; they, too, felt this was strange.

There was actually an earthworm inside. It was completely pink, looking no different than any ordinary breed.

There was actually an earthworm contained inside the raw stone?

Could this also be considered a primitive beast?

Everyone grimaced at this slightly. Only Ling Han could unearth something like this which would render others speechless.

Ling Han set the matter aside for now, and directly grabbed the two Great Herbs that Bao Fengyu had unearthed. Whatever the third raw stone contained, he had already won.

Peng, peng, peng! He moved quickly, giving a severe beating to Bao Fengyu and Niu Buqun.

He had never accepted being threatened. If anyone dared to provoke him, he would be beating them up. If anyone wanted to kill him, he would kill them in return.

After the beating, Ling Han glanced at the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate. If this old geezer made a move on him, he would definitely hold nothing back.

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate’s heart involuntarily stopped for a moment, but he immediately looked back at Ling Han. How could it be that he would be afraid?

“I hope you can keep it up. Don’t give up, don’t lose hope, and continue to challenge me to stone gambling,” Ling Han said to Bao Fengyu and Niu Buqun. These two were quite good people, spending money to present gifts to him. They should be praised.

Both Bao Fengyu and Niu Buqun were depressed. Hearing Ling Han’s words, wasn’t this just treating them like bringers of wealth?

They were both indignant and furious, wanting nothing more than to swallow Ling Han alive.

“Ling Han, don’t be too proud of yourself. We will ask our master to come, and he will definitely defeat you!” Bao Fengyu shouted.

“I very much anticipate that,” Ling Han said smilingly. Here was another person going to present gifts to him; he naturally welcomed that very much.

“Humph!” Niu Buqun and Bao Fengyu left angrily. They would definitely ask their master to appear and defeat Ling Han.

“Brother Ling!”

“Brother Ling Han!”

Once the two of them left, a great many people instantly gathered around him. They were all longing for the Great Herbs in Ling Han’s possession. If this had not been in Culmination City, where the destruction caused by a battle of Heavenly Venerates would be too severe, and would draw the suppression of powerful figures, they would have definitely already made their move by now.

They all wanted to buy the Great Herbs in Ling Han’s possession, especially that healing type. It could very possibly save their lives.

Ling Han tossed out these words. If they wanted to buy, sure, but it could only be traded for Heavenly Venerable Seals. He had no shortage of Divine Metal. Moreover, just look at the high-grade area. Since when was Divine Metal accepted for the purchase of raw stones here?

Even raw stones could not be bought with Divine Metal, what more supremely valuable medicine.

Ling Han continued shopping here, buying all the valuable raw stones. For this, he paid a price of four supremely valuable medicines, but his gains far surpassed his costs. However, there was not a single Heavenly Venerable Seal to be seen, which Ling Han was inevitably disappointed by.

However, it was already acceptable to have managed to obtain two Heavenly Venerable Seals in a single raw stone lane.

Ling Han took these raw stones and left. He was in no rush to unearth the Great Herbs. Actually, raw stones were the best material for preservation. Once they were unearthed, the essence of the medicine would inevitably begin to disperse.

He closely examined that earthworm, but what was disappointing was that this earthworm had long since lost all signs of life. However, after a closer look, he discovered that this was actually not a real earthworm, but rather a Great Herb!

This should be celestial medicine, and it was presently in the stage of taking form. Before it had completed this stage, it had encountered an unknown calamity, and had then been sealed inside this raw stone. Hence, though it had absorbed a great amount of fundamental power of the Genesis World, it was presently neither a Great Herb nor a beast, which was extremely strange.

Ling Han put the earthworm away. Though he did not know what it could be used for now, he might have some use for it in future.

He had also unearthed several Great Herbs, the kind that could improve cultivation level, which he handed to the Empress, Hu Niu, and Ling Xi, respectively. As for Fu Tianxing, he was still tempering his foundations, and had not yet advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, so even if he consumed it now, it would only be wasted.

Who would complain about having a higher cultivation level?

After Ling Han had digested all these Great Herbs, he decided to move out again.

He deliberately exited Culmination City. If anyone had any designs on him, he would settle the matter once and for all.

He possessed the ability to turn the life essence of Heavenly Venerates into his own cultivation. Though he did not very much want to use this ability, who asked others to be so determined to deliver themselves to him? He would not waste their efforts.

He arrived outside the city, and did not hide his tracks at all. It was as if he was just asking for them to rob him.

Unfortunately, he was disappointed. Even the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate did not appear, which caused his anticipation to come to naught.

He returned to Culmination City, and continued to rake in valuable raw stones.

“Ling Han!” He had just entered a city when he saw someone calling out to him.

Ling Han glanced over. This was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He couldn’t help but show a hint of displeasure. What was wrong with this world? Did Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings not know that they should respect Heavenly Venerates?

“My young master would like to see you,” this Celestial King said.

“I refuse,” Ling Han directly rejected.

“Ling Han, don’t be an ungrateful wretch. My young master, Yue Chengwang, is the only son of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate!” this Celestial King announced proudly, clearly threatening Ling Han.

Ling Han was surprised; this guy actually dared to threaten him?

He shook his head. “If he wants to meet me, he should come personally. Doesn’t he have any legs?”

“Ling Han, don’t be an ungrateful wretch!” that Celestial King shouted loudly, a sneer on his face.

Pa!

Ling Han delivered a slap from the distance, and that Celestial King was instantly sent flying. Ling Han stated evenly, “If you continue blustering, I will take your life.”

...

That Celestial King held a hand to his face, and finally did not dare to speak any further. He hurriedly turned and left.

Ling Han did not take it to heart. Counter pawns with the king, and water with an earth weir. Who would he fear?

After meeting with the Empress and the others, they went to another raw stone lane. It was not big, but the size of the raw stone lane did not determine whether there would be treasure or not. Ling Han discovered two Great Herbs there, which he was very pleased about.

He quietly bought a few raw stones, and did not let anyone know just how great his profits were.

Very quickly, he went to a small shop. Half a day later, he left, a smile on his face.

Unfortunately, though he had obtained quite a few Great Herbs, he did not find even a single Heavenly Venerable Seal, which left him slightly disappointed.

After visiting three small shops in a row, Ling Han decided to take a look at a bigger raw stone lane.

This time, neither the Empress nor Hu Niu wanted to follow him and waste their time. To spend the whole day looking at stones was really too boring. Hence, Ling Han entered into the raw stone lane in the company of Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing.
