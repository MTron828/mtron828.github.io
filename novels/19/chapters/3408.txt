Chapter 3409- Challenge Letter

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After he finished speaking, Ling Han left.

If he were to stay any longer, powerful existences like Yuwen Hou and Hu Er would probably come out to challenge him.

In a battle of the same cultivation level, Ling Han was unafraid of anyone, but would these people suppress their cultivation level to fight him?

Although Yuwen Hou was also in the Inscription Tier, this prodigy had the ability to fight above his level, and his battle prowess could reach Enlightenment Tier. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to challenge Hong Tianbu back then. Although they hadn’t really fought, it was enough to prove how powerful he was.

Right now, Ling Han did not have the strength to rival Enlightenment Tier. Even if he reached the Fifth Extreme, it would probably be impossible. …Unless he could advance to the level of Sixth Extreme, or even Seventh Extreme in fact.

Thus, if he didn’t leave now, he would be asking for a beating. Ling Han didn’t have any masochistic tendencies.

When he returned to the academy, he applied to the academy. He had already advanced into the Extreme Bone Tier and requested to graduate.

He was a double Grandmaster. After making such a request, the academy would naturally approve it immediately and agree to his request. A few big shots of the academy even personally came out to send him off.

Although Ling Han had left the academy, Huan Xue was still there. He really did not have the time to guide this little handmaiden. It was better to leave this mission to the academy.

He found a place outside, and it was very quiet. In any case, he had money, so he bought this place-it was said that property in the Imperial Capital had been rising in value in recent years, so buying it as an investment was not bad although Ling Han did not lack this bit of money that he would earn from an investment.

After settling down, Ling Han began to ponder about Floating Wind and Clouds.

Although he had mastered this movement technique in a short period of time he had yet to push it to its limits. Therefore, he could only increase the speed ’ of sound by one fold, not twice.

“When I broke through to the Seventh Change, I activated a Mystical Power. If I can break through to the Seventh Extreme, will it allow me to have another Mystical Power?” Ling Han muttered, looking forward to it very much.

Acquired Mystical Powers could not be compared to innate Mystical Powers but some acquired Mystical Powers were also incomparably powerful. Eye ’ techniques were one of them.

However, Ling Han’s current eye technique was too weak, and was far from reaching Second Baby’s level.

It was fine. He believed that as his cultivation level increased, his eye technique would definitely become stronger.

The greatest benefit of the ocular technique is that it can be used to break formations.” Ling Han smiled. Coupled with him, who was a super Formation Master, it would definitely be easier to break the restrictions in the future. He would not have to rely on that pig all the time.

“Eh, fat pig, why are you following me?” He looked at the lecherous pig.

The lecherous pig was sleeping on its stomach. When it heard this, it looked at him and lowered its head again, looking like it could not be bothered with him. strange, didn’t this pig like beauties? Why didn’t it stick to Huan Xue and followed him instead?

Could it be that he was targeting the seven Calabash Brothers?

‘Well, you’re on your own then. That’s seven violent children we’re talking about. You’re lucky they didn’t turn you into a roast suckling pig.’ In fact, it was not that the seven children did not want to eat the roasted suckling pig. Fourth Baby even in fact spat fire at the lecherous pig, wanting to roast it directly. She did not expect that such high-level energy could not hurt the lecherous pig.

“Pervert, who the hell are you?”

The little piggy looked at Ling Han with a mocking gaze, making gurgling sounds, as if it was looking down on him.

“If you continue like this, be careful not to have anything to eat today!” Ling Han threatened.

The lecherous pig immediately cowered. He had no backbone at all.

Ling Han stayed in his new residence for two days. Gradually, people learned of his new address, and soon, people came to visit.

As expected, the Demon Race did not give up and challenged him again. Ling Han ignored all the challenges that came knocking on his door. He had to keep his word, right?

Seeing that Ling Han did not respond, the Demon Race could only send the letter of challenge to Xuanyuan Dingguo.

Xuanyuan Dingguo started running around. He was an influential figure in the academy, but after he left, he was only one of General Xuanyuan’s descendants He was not outstanding.

However, after collaborating with Ling Han, he was already outstanding financially, and now, he was repeatedly showing his face in front of many mighty figures, furiously making his presence known, and his status instantly rose.????????????????????????????????? y

This was naturally all because of Ling Han, so Xuanyuan Dingguo was also willing to run errands for Ling Han.

“Grandmaster Ling, how hateful are you?” Xuanyuan Dingguo walked in and threw down several challenge letters. “I heard that Princess Bixiao is also very dissatisfied with you. A maid once saw her saying your name when no one was around. She gritted her teeth and wished she could eat your flesh.”

Ling Han bared his teeth. Was this necessary?

Hadn’t I just stolen some Treasured Fruits? The Demon Race has plenty of them.

Uh, the key should be on those underwear, right?

Ling Han decided that this was something that he absolutely could not admit.

“Who is challenging me?” Ling Han asked.

“Right now, we’ve received a total of seven declarations of challenge, but we don’t need to pay attention to six of them. They’re all existences in the Extreme Bone Tier, and the stakes they put up are completely insufficient. However, take a look at this…” Xuanyuan Dingguo pushed over a declaration of challenge. Ling Han picked it up and saw that it was from Yuwen Hou.

“Des he want another 10 seconds this time?” Ling Han asked with a smile After he finished reading the letter of challenge, he snorted. It turned out that Yuwen Hou had not mentioned suppressing his cultivation level at all, and had purely challenged him.

“He has the advantage of a major cultivation level, and he’s six or seven years older than you, so even if he wins, he won’t be able to redeem the dignity of the Demon Race,” Xuanyuan Dingguo analyzed from the side. “So, I think this is Yuwen Hou’s personal revenge.”

Pausing for a moment, he said, “Combined with Princess Bixiao’s hatred for you previously, I believe that Yuwen Hou is standing up for her!”

The fact that Princess Bixiao was in the Mystery Realm Tier was probably not known by many in the Demon Race. Thus, if a beautiful and weak princess was bullied by Ling Han, would her pursuers just sit back and watch?

Definitely not.

Thus, Yuwen Hou came to challenge Ling Han.

Lmg Han took another look. Yuwen Hou’s wager was quite valuable. It was a Green Jade Bamboo.

The Green Jade Bamboo was extremely light, but it was also incomparably tough. It was an excellent material that could be used in many places.

Ling Han smiled. Of course, he would not agree to a “fair” battle with Yuwen

Hou. This was simply asking for a beating.

Forget it, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.

“You brat, do you have an unspeakable relationship with Princess Bixiao?” Xuanyuan Dingguo suddenly said with a perverted look ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lmg Han was astounded. ‘Why did your f*cking persona suddenly change?’ I remember that you weren’t a pervert in the past. The large black dog hasn’t come out yet, so it won’t affect you at all. Why do you suddenly seem like a different person?

“It must be. Otherwise, Princess Bixiao wouldn’t have gritted her teeth at you!” Xuanyuan Dingguo made up his own mind. “Damn it, you got the princess of the Demon Race without telling anyone!”

“I’m jealous of you. B*stard, that’s my goddess!”

The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched. He believed that Xuanyuan Dingguo must have taken the wrong medicine..
