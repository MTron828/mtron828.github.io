2656 Pursuit and attack

That Fifth Heaven Celestial King faltered slightly. He had not thought that Ling Han would actually ask this kind of question.

‘Have you gone dumb?’ he thought, but of course, he would not dare voice this out. He hurriedly answered obediently, “This is Star Arrival City, and is really quite far away from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.”

“Get me a map.” Ling Han waved him off.

That Fifth Heaven Celestial King hurriedly brought a map, and handed it over to Ling Han.

Ling Han glanced at the map. This was indeed quite far. With the speed of a Celestial King, he would still have to run for at least 80-100 years. He was faster than the typical Celestial King, but 50 years was definitely still needed.

He tossed the map back to the other. Peng! Exerting force, he burst through the air.

“Goodness, this lord’s might is truly shocking.” That Fifth Heaven Celestial King couldn’t help but lay a hand on his chest. “He is clearly just at the Seventh Heaven, but why does he give me a feeling that is even more terrifying than a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?”

He collapsed onto the ground. He had to drink some tea to soothe his nerves.

However, before he had even finished a single cup of tea, weng, another terrifying aura appeared. Then, a figure completely wrapped up inside a black cloak appeared. Both build and gender were indistinguishable.

That Fifth Heaven Celestial King steeled himself, and asked, “Who are you, sir?”

The cloaked person naturally was Desolate Moon. He ignored the other party, and drew his right hand through the air. Instantly, the scene of Ling Han conversing with the Fifth Heaven Celestial King appeared once more.

Regulations of Time, tracing back the roots of history.

Because it had just happened, it could be traced. Otherwise, if too much time had passed, the past could not be touched.

That Fifth Heaven Celestial King couldn’t help but wipe away the cold sweat on his forehead. This mysterious figure in front of him gave him an extremely frightening feeling.

Desolate Moon withdrew his hand, and glanced at that Fifth Heaven Celestial King, his eyes blazing with killing intent.

He had been set up, and became hateful of everyone. Furthermore, while he still had intelligence after he was modified by Hysteria, it was inevitable that his personality would be affected, causing him to become extremely bloodthirsty. Now that he had left the Celestial King Graveyard, everyone here had become his prey.

“It won’t take much longer,” Desolate Moon murmured. Boom! Endless black light suddenly surged out of his body, spreading out towards the whole city.

“What are you—” That Fifth Heaven Celestial King hurriedly tried to stop him, but the moment he came in contact with the black light, he immediately turned puppet-like, no longer capable of movement.

In the matter of a few breaths, every living creature in the city was captured by the black light and turned into stone or wood. The city that had just been extremely lively moments ago had instantly become a dead city.

“Hahahaha!” Desolate Moon laughed loudly. Peng! He soared into the skies, and continued his pursuit of Ling Han. Xiu, xiu, xiu! He absorbed all the black light back into his body, but all the living beings in the city also turned into dust at the same time.

“Lord Hysteria’s plans definitely cannot be stopped because of you!”

***

Ling Han only knew that Desolate Moon would definitely pursue him, but he did not know that Desolate Moon would also create massive bloodshed in the process.

Ling Han’s stamina was abundant, and he did not stop at all, heading directly for the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. When one had reached the height that he had, who would stop him along the way? To say nothing of the fact that his battle prowess far surpassed his cultivation level, merely his status as a Seventh Heaven Celestial King was enough to allow him to do anything he liked.

But it should be known that Ling Han was also a person who had a halo that attracted trouble!

He had not encountered any trouble throughout a few years on the journey, but on one particular day, he crashed head-first into a battle.

Ling Han was really innocent. He had been running too quickly, and to save himself time, he would definitely be forging ahead on a straight course. He had not thought that he would actually rush into a chaotic battle which involved quite a few parties.

He did not consider stopping, but rather just forged forcefully ahead. In any case, with his tough physique, he could even take on the attack of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King head-on after channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Naturally, he would have no further reservations. He only needed to rush forwards in a single stroke.

“How dare you!!”

“How greedy!!”

He had not thought that this charge would actually anger everyone, and they all attacked him.

There were Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings and even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings among these people. Otherwise, they would not have dared to so aggressively attack a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Ling Han ignored them completely, just forging onwards while he was being attacked. Yet it caused these people to attack him even more madly.

Golden light flickered all over his body. Peng, he rushed out of the crowd while completely ignoring all attacks. Mist was wafting ahead of him, with a plume of purple-red clouds that were as dazzling as flames.

So there was a Celestial medicine here!

Ling Han finally understood. These people were fighting over the Celestial medicine, and the ownership of this Celestial medicine had not yet been determined. They had just been fighting intensely, and had not expected that Ling Han would barge in and interfere, directly rushing into their midst.

“Don’t even think about it!” Everyone grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed. Since he had seen it, there was no reason that he should miss out on it. This Celestial King was indeed a Celestial-King-Tier Great Herb, and its age was shocking. It would give him considerable help as well.

He moved, grabbing out at the Celestial medicine.

Peng, peng, peng! All the attacks flew towards him, and they were all absorbed by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. But when Ling Han laid down his palm, he gave a light exclamation of surprise because he actually pressed his hand down on nothing.

The Celestial medicine had grown legs and run?

Ling Han withdrew his hand, yet saw that the Celestial medicine was still where it had been.

This was just a deception!

The real Celestial medicine was not here, or even on this plane at all. Its image was just a reflection, and it was not clear where it really was at all.

If Ling Han was given enough time, he would definitely be able to find the whereabouts of this Celestial medicine, but he was now in a rush to get back to the martial academy, so he naturally could only give up the matter with great reluctance.

He shook his head, and was about to leave when he suddenly frowned.

“You have really been hard to find.” Desolate Moon’s voice rang out. Black Qi that filled the skies descended like railings that surrounded Ling Han. Because this cage was too massive, those people from before had also been closed in.

“Who are you?”

“Why have you imprisoned us?”

“Don’t bring trouble onto yourself!”

These people were all calling out, each of them furious.

“So noisy!” Desolate Moon humphed coldly, and the black Qi suddenly stormed. Shua, shua, shua! These people were all blasted by the black Qi, and were immediately turned stone-like. Then, they shattered with a resounding boom, turning into dust.

He was a supreme monarch star at peak stage Ninth Heaven! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han turned around, and faced Desolate Moon directly. Though he did not want to clash with Desolate Moon right now, who asked him to have encountered trouble, and it was just this momentary delay that allowed Desolate Moon to catch up to him.

“I still don’t know your name yet,” Desolate Moon stated calmly. “To have me personally deal with you, you are now worthy to have your name remembered by me.”

Ling Han shook his head. “I am not concerned about the praises of a lackey, but since you asked, then remember this. My name is Ling Han!”

“It is unfortunate. You have lost your chance to take another step further. Otherwise, your future prospects would be boundless!” Desolate Moon shook his head. By now, Ling Han was already trapped, and everything was over.

“Glib talk, but ultimately, it is only the delusional words of a maniac.” Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword. Xiu! His figure flashed, yet he had no wish to clash forcefully with Desolate Moon at all. Instead, he waved his sword in a slash at the prison that the black Qi had formed.

What was the most important now was to return to the martial academy and report the circumstances. Everything else could be set aside for later.

How sharp was the Divine Demon Sword? It had surpassed the level of a Celestial Tool, and even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was directly hit, his fate would only be being sliced in half. Thus, as the sword descended, the black Qi was immediately severed.

Ling Han charged out, shooting out madly at an extraordinary speed.

Desolate Moon was surprised. While he immediately set forth to pursue, he turned his eyes on the Divine Demon Sword. A look of dawning realization flashed across his face. That was Devouring Metal.
