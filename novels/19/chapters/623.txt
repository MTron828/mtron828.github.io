Chapter 624: Invitation

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Fire was about to burst out of that man’s gaze as he said, “I’m Nong Xue Yun. My great great ancestor is the Heaven Grade alchemist Nong Bo Xin! Brat, are you sure you want to contest with me?”

Everyone gave an “oh.” No wonder this person could take out medium level Earth Grade medicinal pills, turned out he had a Heaven Grade great ancestor.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “We’re buying something now; obviously the one who offers the higher price wins. Why are you bringing up your great ancestor?”

“Fine! You win!” Nong Xue Yun stared fiercely at Ling Han and turned to leave.

Everyone couldn’t help but break into hoots of laughter. This person had terrible moral character and intentionally deprecated the bottle earlier, making many people give up on the idea of contesting. Now that he couldn’t win, he parted with threatening words, making a joke of himself for nothing.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and threw a jade bottle towards the old man before he picked up the Refine Celestial Bottle.

The old man hurriedly opened the bottle cork and dumped out a medicinal pill to examine, but he wasn’t an expert in this area. Although he saw the vein-like patterns closely interwoven on the medical pill, grand and magnificent, he was completely unaware of exactly what medicine it was.

“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t cheat you!” Ling Han said with a smile.

The old man was obviously unbelieving, but firstly, the two thousand years old White Jade Ginseng already reached his expected price, and secondly, these two medicinal pills also seemed extremely magnificent, unlikely to be of ordinary grade, so he was obviously profiting here anyway.

Anyway, even if he accepted Nong Xue Yun’s offer, how would he confirm that the other party’s medicinal pills were genuine?

He packed up the street stall. Since he’d already achieved his objective, it was obviously better to run off so as to avoid being targeted by others. Although he was at the Spiritual Infant Tier, his Qi and blood were severely exhausted, and his battle prowess was at most one-hundredth of his peak days, so in reality, he was only equivalent to a Flower Blossom Tier expert.

The youngsters here were all geniuses, and a Flower Blossom Tier elite among them could probably defeat him, so he was obviously afraid of being robbed.

Established by customary convention, everyone spent money to buy things, but if someone were really to be robbed, who would actually come forward to stand up for him?

So, the earlier he left, the more assured he’d be.

Ling Han smiled as he weighed the bottle in his hand and examined it closely with the Eye of Truth, seeing that the bottom of the bottle had a subtle difference from the body of the bottle—probably not an integral part of the structure.

The bottom of the bottle was older than the rest, and it was as if someone had intentionally made the bottle over it afterwards for the sake of concealing it.

‘Interesting,’ he thought. It should be taken into Black Tower and studied carefully.

He put away the bottle and saw that many people were staring at him.

Wealth shouldn’t be revealed inadvertently; he took out two thousand years old ginsengs and two Heart Protection Pills without a care, obviously making many people who wanted to make some ill-gotten gains have ideas about him. However, Ling Han didn’t care. If anyone were to rob him, he wouldn’t mind robbing them in turn till they didn’t even have their underpants left.

“Young gentleman, my lady has sent you a written invitation, inviting you to the attend banquet at night.” Just as Ling Han was about to leave, a beautiful servant girl walked over and delivered a pink invitation, which had a faint fragrance wafting from it.

Ling Han didn’t immediately accept, but instead asked, “Who’s your lady?”

“Boy, you don’t even know Lady Small Peach?” Someone sneered. “Lady Small Peach is Lady Yi Yun’s personal servant girl!”

“What, Lady Yi Yun!?”

“Wang Family’s pearl, Lady Yi Yun?”

“Rumor has it, Lady Yi Yun is not only beautiful like a fairy, but also proficient in music, and even more so an exceptional talent of martial arts. At nine, she was recruited into the Azure Thunder Sect as an exception, and although her reputation falls short of Dong Ling Er’s, if we mention the ten greatest beauties in the middle state, she’s definitely famous amongst them.”

“Beautiful as a fairy, battle prowess like a goddess, an unparalleled woman!”

Everyone exclaimed with admiration. Wang Yi Yun obviously received the direct entry to the Restore Heaven Academy and actually hosted a banquet nearby... how truly extravagant!

“The Wang Family is also an influential martial arts family that has an extremely long legacy. It’s said that the great ancestor of the Wang Family is still alive, having Heaven Tier cultivation, but it’s probably impossible for them to take the last step, advancing into Shattering Void Tier.”

“With Wang Family’s financial ability, constructing a temporary palace wouldn’t be something difficult.”

“Heh, so envious. If only I could also go check out the banquet... There definitely isn’t a lack of geniuses that have direct entry to the Restore Heaven Academy among the invitees.”

“But why can this guy get receive an invitation? Doesn’t seem like he’s all that impressive, right”

Everyone looked at Ling Han, unable to discover anything surprising about him.

Ling Han pondered, but accepted the invitation, and said, “Alright, then I’ll go have a look at night.”

The servant girl bowed and turned to leave. Everyone hurriedly made way, treating her with great respect, which magnified Wang Yi Yun’s dominance.

It couldn’t be helped that she received direct entry qualifications from the Restore Heaven Academy, right? This qualification was equivalent to dividing people into layers. Those who received qualification were first grade, and those who didn’t were second and third grade.

“Boy, let Uncle Rabbit see that bottle!” The rabbit suddenly became interested in that bottle.

“Oh, why?” Ling Han asked thoughtlessly.

“Earlier, it was that Nong whatever, and now someone’s inviting you to attend a banquet... it’s obviously not because they know of your strength, but because they’re targeting that bottle. At the banquet, they’ll definitely force you to hand it over, so Uncle Rabbit’s become interested,” the rabbit said.

Ling Han was astounded, and said, “Your intelligence surprisingly isn’t low!”

“Of course, Uncle Rabbit’s brain is unprecedented in the last five hundred years and unseen in the future five hundred years, of course its tip-top... Wait, you mean, you always thought that Uncle Rabbit was a joke?” The rabbit suddenly came to a realization.

Ling Han curled his lips, and said, “You said that yourself.”

“You dare insult your Uncle Rabbit, I’ll bestow you a bloody face— ah!” The rabbit thought to sharpen its claws and pounce at Ling Han, but Hu Niu bit onto its tail by surprise, making it scream in pain again.

“Don’t be harsh to Niu’s Ling, or else Niu’ll eat you!” Hu Niu looked extremely fierce.

The rabbit feared no one but Hu Niu, instantly keeping silent.

Since there was still some time before night, Ling Han came to a remote place, and then flashed into the Black Tower.

“Hm, where’s that guy?” The rabbit opened wide its bright red eyes.

“There, walked into the forest.” Hu Niu cooked up a lie casually.

The rabbit was unbelieving, but Ling Han certainly disappeared without a trace; it felt extremely strange.

After enetering the Black Tower, Ling Han began studying the Refine Celestial Bottle.

This definitely couldn’t refine celestials!

Ling Han said inwardly, and resolutely, pa, he shattered the body of the bottle.

As expected, the body of the bottle was certainly of inferior quality, at most equivalent to forth tier rare metals; with Ling Han’s current physique and brute force, it was easily smashed into pieces. Weng, the bottom of the bottle floated into the air. Complex vein-like patterns could be seen on the face that was originally facing the inside of the bottle, and they looked like dao flowers, making one lost in thought at first glance.

“What is this thing?!” Ling Han said, extremely surprised.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
