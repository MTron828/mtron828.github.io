Chapter 3594: Problematic child

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Don’t go, don’t go!” The silver-haired little lolita caught up with him, Handsome Brother, what’s your name?”

Ling Han was amused. This little girl was really too precocious. Furthermore, she was really too unafraid of strangers. Couldn’t you think for a moment that I might kidnap you?

Such an exquisite, beautiful little girl was almost comparable to Hu Niu when she was young.

“My name is Ling Han,” he said with a smile. “What about you?”

“I am the Demon King!” The silver-haired little lolita puffed out her chest.

Ling Han chuckled, but did not speak.

“Seeing as you want to know so much, I’ll kindly tell you.” The silver-haired little lolita humphed, “My name is Tang Yun’er, but my family calls me Little Toffee.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself. Little Toffee, en, this was really a quite appropriate name.

“Little Toffee, why did you run out all by yourself?” he asked.

Tang Yun’er immediately looked like she was guarding against thieves. She took a step back, and said, “Are you planning to kidnap and sell me? Let me tell you, I am very powerful, and you will be unlucky!” Then, she burst into tears “Mom, I want my mom. The people outside are so scary. They want to kidnap and sell cute, beautiful, obedient, filial…”

She thought for a moment, then counted on her fingers again.”… clever brave Little Toffee!”

Ling Han’s expression couldn’t help but darken. What was going on here?

“No one is going to kidnap you, don’t worry.” He sighed, feeling a headache coming on.

“You really won’t abduct Little Toffee?” The silver-haired little lolita cocked her head as she looked at Ling Han.

“No.” Ling Han shook his head, then mumbled, “I would have to be able to sell you off.”

Wa! Tang Yun’er started to cry again. She pointed at Ling Han and said, “You still want to sell me off! Wuwuwu, I’m so pitiful!”

She peeled out the toffee, and began to eat.

As she chewed, she stopped crying. In any case, she had no tears. “Then you have to find me a good family. I have to have candy every day.” Lmg Han’s expression darkened even further, “I already said I am not selling you, not selling you!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Tang Yun’er spread out her hands, “How boring. You’re not going to play anymore. I thought it would have been quite interesting.”

Crack, crack, crack. She chewed on the toffee, looking very pleased.

Ling Han was certain that this little loli was definitely not from the Celestial Sea Planet, but had come from another planet. However, her background should be even more powerful, so she had come on a shuttle.

“You ran away from home, didn’t you?” he asked.

The little girl paled in shock, “How do you know? Have you been secretly following me, and have long wanted to kidnap me?” She was incredibly narcissistic, “It can’t be helped. Who asked me to be so cute, beautiful, obedient, filial, er…”

She had forgotten her lines again.

“Clever and courageous,” Ling Han said on her behalf.

“En, en, en, Little Toffee is that outstanding!” The little loli nodded vigorously. ‘You seem to have gone in the wrong direction. Weren’t you just talking about kidnapping?’

“It’s about time to go back. Your family will be worried,” Ling Han said. Even though Niu Jianhua had been knocked out and robbed the moment he arrived, that was because Niu Jianhua deserved it. Ling Han naturally couldn’t bring himself to make a move on a little loli who had run away from home. Tang Yun’er shook her head vigorously, her beautiful silver hair dancing in the Wind, as if she was an elf, “I don’t want to! Mommy scolded me, and Father didn’t help me either. Grandfather wasn’t present either. I want to run away from home, and drive them crazy with anxiety!”

Just a little scolding, and she had run away from home?

‘Just how doted on are you usually?’

Ling Han shook his head, “How did your mother scold you?”

“I didn’t finish my meal, and Mommy scolded me. Daddy is even worse not helping me!” the little loli said angrily.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. This was a little mistress.

“Hurry, continue to use that shuttle to return,” he said.

“No, I’ve used up all my energy.” The little loli shook her head, then grabbed onto the corner of Ling Han’s clothes, “Uncle, just let me be your daughter for a few days. I am so cute, beautiful, obedient, filial…”

-Stop, stop, stop!” Ling Han hurriedly waved his hands, “I can’t afford to raise you!”

The little girl’s snacks were all made from Golden Cloud Cow Milk, so even if it killed him, he wouldn’t be able to afford feeding her.

“I’ve prepared a lot of snacks,” Tang Yun’er said proudly. “Since I have run away from home, how can I be unprepared?”

That seemed to make a lot of sense, but why didn’t you bring some more energy crystals or something like that? The shuttle was useless after travelling for half a journey??? ;>

“Your Spatial Spirit Tool is just filled with snacks?” Ling Han bared his teeth.

“If I am not storing snacks, what else would I be storing?” the little girl countered, her expression self-righteous.

‘Fine, you win.’

Ling Han sighed, and said, “All right, follow me for the next few days. When the shuttle can be used again, go home immediately.”

Though the little loli’s thoughts were slightly strange, she was obviously not an idiot. At this time, she had no intention of disobeying Ling Han.

She was secretly pleased with herself. When would the shuttle be able to run… wasn’t it up to her to decide?

Her great dream was to establish a kingdom, and then find a great many handsome men to line up and feed her.

Not good!

Ling Han’s expression suddenly changed. He could sense a, no, several powerful auras were approaching.

He was just about to put on the Void Beast hide, but it was already too late. Xiu, xiu, xiu, five figures had already appeared.

Niu Jianhua and his four elderly servants.

He was really like a lingering ghost. Why had he caught up again?

Lmg Han knew that this must have been drawn by the commotion caused by the little loli descending from the shuttle, but these people were actually nearby, which still gave him a shock.

“Young Master, it’s him!” Wang Quan immediately pointed at Ling Han and shouted.

He really hated Ling Han to the core, causing him to be insulted and humiliated by Niu Jianhua. He was almost doubting life itself.

Meanwhile, Niu Jianhua was looking at Ling Han. He was a little curious. His group had been attracted by the shooting star, and he had not thought that he would so coincidentally encounter Ling Han.

However, if Ling Han was Can Ye, then it wouldn’t be strange for this guy to appear here-previously, when he descended into the world, didn’t this guy also come at the first instant to knock him out?

Humph, if it was you, you would regret coming to this world.

Niu Jianhua looked at the little loli again, and couldn’t help but be startled.

How could there be such a beautiful little girl?

In theory, Foundation Building Tier cultivators were qualified to traverse the universe, but with the speed of Foundation Building Tier cultivators, if they set out from a planet and flew all the way until their lifespan dried up, they still wouldn’t be able to reach any planet that was suitable for cultivation. Even he, who had had the help of the power of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, had ’ spent about a year’s time to come here.

This little loli was definitely a real little girl, and not an old monster that could not grow. Thus, there was definitely a Spirit Transformation True Lord standing behind her as well.

—Why wasn’t it a great elite of the Minor Advanced Tier?

Because the overall level of the Celestial Sea Planet was very low, so how could

a great elite on the level of Sect Master be interested in it?

That’s not right. Though this planet was not worth the notice of Sect

Master-level great elites, there was no problem at all for their descendants to come and train.

Niu Jianhua couldn’t confirm just how powerful this little lolita’s background was.

He decided to set this aside first, and find out Ling Han’s true identity.

“Your name is Ling Han?” he asked Ling Han..
