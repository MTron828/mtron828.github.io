3064 Arrival

A woman like her deserved to die.

Wang Quanhe was about to make his move, but right at this moment, he heard a long howl that sounded like a thunderclap. Pa, pa, pa! Most of the people fell to the ground.

Everyone was astounded. Which elite had arrived? The commotion was too great.

In the blink of an eye, an old man appeared in the hall.

How strange. They had clearly never seen him before, yet everyone felt a sense of familiarity.

The elder’s face was filled with anger, and he quickly fixed his gaze on Wang Quanhe. “How dare you kill my beloved grandson!! Humph, I was just nearby. Do you think you can leave so easily after killing him?”

Oh!

Everyone understood. They hadn’t seen this old man before, but they felt a sense of familiarity because this old man was Luo Guang’s grandfather, Luo Xiuxian. He had previously appeared, his image condensed from multiple light spots.

This was an Ascending Origin Tier great elite!

Wang Quanhe remained calm and collected.

It was impossible to say that he wasn’t afraid. After all, the difference in strength was too great. However, after cultivating with Ling Han for “10 years,” he had already learned to be calm.

Even if the sky collapsed, he wouldn’t be moved.

Furthermore, Ling Han had once said that he only needed to be concerned about taking revenge, and that he didn’t need to worry about anything else.

Did he believe Ling Han’s words?

Of course Wang Quanhe believed him. The other party was an existence that even Prince Ma Xuan had to address as a lord. Would he lie to Wang Quanhe?

However, under the current circumstances, how could it be that Ling Han could suddenly appear here?

“Greetings, milord!” Everyone knelt down and bowed to the elder. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Luo Xiuxian completely ignored them. They were a bunch of trash with the highest level only being Severing Mundane Tier, and they weren’t even worthy of a second look from him.

“Brat, how do you want to die?” he said indifferently, but his eyes were filled with hatred.

“Old geezer, stand aside.” A voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone was surprised. Hiss, who was this person? Didn’t he know who Luo Xiuxian was? How dared he call him an old geezer and ask him to stand aside? He was truly audacious.

A look of joy instantly appeared on Wang Quanhe’s face. This was Ling Han!

It turned out that… he had been following him.

He couldn’t help but feel excited, because he knew what level of existence Ling Han was—even if he wasn’t very clear, he at least knew that he was awesome to the point where even Celestial Kings had to kneel and pay their respects.

How could he not be touched by the fact that such a mighty figure had been protecting him?

Luo Xiuxian looked over, and he couldn’t help but sneer. “And who are you?” This was just a small Severing-Mundane-Tier force, so how could there be so many people who didn’t know what was good for them?

Sigh, this place was too backward. Most likely, everyone thought that Severing Mundane Tiers were the strongest existences, right?

Ling Han shook his head. He was just about to slap this fellow to death when he let out a soft cry of surprise and looked into the distance.

Boom! Colorful clouds danced in the sky, and a person walked over on a colorful cloud with ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around his body.

Prince Ma Xuan.

When Luo Xiuxian saw this, his expression instantly became solemn.

He could look down on everyone here, but in the face of a Celestial King, he could only feel fear and trepidation.

Xiu! Prince Ma Xuan landed. His gaze swept across the area, and although it swept past Ling Han, he turned a blind eye to him—Ling Han had used some sort of trick to make it impossible for anyone else to discover him at all.

“Nephew, are you alright?” His gaze stopped on Wang Quanhe, his expression looking like a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Fortunately, Wang Quanhe was fine.

As a dignified Celestial King, it was naturally impossible for him not to know that an Ascending Origin Tier elite had appeared nearby.

Originally, he didn’t need to take this to heart. It was normal for someone to pass by or have some matters to attend to. He didn’t need to make a fuss.

However, the problem was that he was very concerned about Wang Quanhe. Previously, he had deliberately investigated Wang Quanhe and learned about the Wang Clan.

Thus, he could guess that Wang Quanhe was going to take revenge this time.

He was afraid that if something happened to Wang Quanhe… he would be blamed by Ling Han.

The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong. He immediately rushed over.

As expected, his premonition was right. It seemed that Wang Quanhe was really targeted by this Ascending Origin Tier.

“I’m fine. Thank you for your concern, Lord Ma.” Wang Quanhe bowed slightly.

In Ling Han’s eyes, this was already very humble. It had to be known that the Ling Clan could casually produce a handful of Heavenly Venerates, so Celestial Kings were really nothing.

However, in everyone’s eyes, it was as if the sky was about to collapse.

That was a Celestial King, yet he was actually so close to Wang Quanhe.

Now that the truth was out, it was no wonder he became so powerful. It was because there was a Celestial King who was nurturing him vigorously.

In the hearts of these people, Celestial Kings were omnipotent. Thus, it was very normal for Wang Quanhe to completely transform in three years.

Prince Ma Xuan then looked at Luo Xiuxian and frowned. “This has nothing to do with you. Leave.” He waved a hand.

When the same words came out of Ling Han’s mouth, Luo Xiuxian would explode in anger. However, when they came out of Prince Ma Xuan’s mouth, Luo Xiuxian did not dare to get angry at all. He could only feel indignant.

He argued, “Milord, this kid killed my grandson. Please let me take revenge.”

Prince Ma Xuan glanced at him with pity, thinking to himself, ‘Let’s not talk about the fact that he only killed your grandson. Even if it’s your own son or father, you have to endure and accept it because you can’t afford to offend the person behind him.’

Of course, as a dignified Celestial King, he didn’t need to explain anything to an Ascending Origin Tier. He said indifferently, “Do you have any objections to me telling you to leave?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Luo Xiuxian gritted his teeth. Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he said, “I’m an elder of the Red Flame Sect, and the sect master of our sect is also a Celestial King. Please reconsider the matter on this basis, milord.”

“Are you using the Red Flame Sect to intimidate me?” Prince Ma Xuan’s expression immediately darkened, and he laughed coldly in his heart. To say nothing of a mere Celestial King, so what if a Heavenly Venerate came?

No matter how big the world was, Ling Han was the greatest there was.

“Get lost!” he reprimanded.

Luo Xiuxian had no choice, so he could only turn around and leave. With such low strength, he didn’t dare to challenge a Celestial King.

Seeing Luo Xiuxian run away so dejectedly, everyone was so shocked that their scalps went numb.

For the sake of Wang Quanhe, Prince Ma Xuan was actually willing to offend a Celestial-King-Tier force.

How doting was he towards Wang Quanhe?

Li Jingchu felt even more regretful. If she had been firm in her beliefs and stayed by Wang Quanhe’s side back then, with Prince Ma Xuan’s attitude towards Wang Quanhe, it would have been a piece of cake for him to take her in as his personal disciple, right?

‘And now?’

Luo Guang was dead. Everything was over.

No, Luo Guang was dead, but Wang Quanhe was still alive. He was deeply favored by a Celestial King.

Her eyes flickered. At this moment, she had to make an extremely important decision.

In an instant, she made up her mind.

“Quanhe, help me!” She stretched out her hand towards Wang Quanhe. “Actually, I was forced. I love you so deeply, how could I betray you! But I had no choice. The clan threatened me with my mother’s life. If I didn’t listen to their orders, my mother would be killed by them.

“This time, the clan threatened me with my mother’s life and forced me to marry Luo Guang!

“Quanhe, save me, save my mother!”
