Chapter 1958: Raped by a spear

Ling Han released a battle cry, his figure charging out, completely ignoring the soul slash that had been unleashed by the Death Scythe.

“Reckless and foolish!” Fei Yun smirked coldly.

The slash of the Death Scythe arrived. Weng, Ling Han’s robes fluttered by themselves, and it was to a very great extent at that. A few corners of his robes had been directly torn, even.

It should be known that the robes he was wearing were nothing ordinary, but rather something woven from the combination of Pseudo-Divine Metal and Divine Silk, possessing astonishing defense, but now a corner of theirs had actually been torn. This really was extremely terrifying.

But what was more terrifying was Ling Han. He charged over, completely unaffected, his punch aiming straight for Fei Yun’s face.

‘What?!’

Fei Yun’s mouth gaped, soundlessly saying this word, and his eyes were filled with a strong disbelief.

How could Ling Han have blocked this blow so easily?

But whether Fei Yun accepted it or not, and believed it or not, Ling Han’s fist was already close at hand.

“Humph!” Brandishing his scythe, Fei Yun met the incoming blow. Wanting to use bare hands to face his Celestial Tool?

What a joke. Even though this scythe was only a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool, it had been sharpened by a Celestial King, and had just a sliver of the might of a Celestial King. It was incredibly sharp, and had indirectly increased his battle prowess.

‘Come, see if I won’t slice off your fist, and we’ll see if you will still move your hands unnecessarily.’

Ling Han saw this, but he still maintained his posture of delivering a punch without change. However, he did begin to channel the Xuanyin Source Water.

Peng!

The scythe slashed over, landing on Ling Han’s wrist, and creating a clash of great dao and a conflict of Regulations. Countless seals were torn to bits, but Ling Han’s fist was unscathed. He pierced through all this, and continued to deliver his attack towards Fei Yun.

F-freak!

This time, Fei Yun was really stunned. The weapon had been sharpened by a Celestial King, and still couldn’t slice off Ling Han’s wrist. ‘Have your defenses f****** been strengthened by a Celestial King?’

Of course not. That was because the Xuanyin Source Water had shown its might.

This was a Source Power of heaven and earth. Though it was limited by Ling Han’s own cultivation level, could Fei Yun really unleash the full might of a Celestial King?

Of course not. Moreover, only a sliver of his power had been boosted by a Celestial King, while the Xuanyin Source Water was Ling Han’s own Source Power. How could it compare?

Thus, since both sides had been weakened, Ling Han naturally was unharmed.

Peng!

The punch blasted, and landed on Fei Yun’s body, sending his whole person flying. Ling Han shot out, catching up to him with a single step. Again, another punch flew out. Peng, Fei Yun’s figure instantly flew upwards into the skies.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Ling Han caught up, and continued the barrage of blows.

Fei Yun was really deserving of being a top-tier monarch tier—even if he wasn’t, he should be very close to it. HIs whole person curled into a ball, his hands covering his face, and guarding this spot, which was also the most important region.

This was enough to ensure he did not sustain heavy injury.

Ling Han had a great many ways to pierce through this defense, like the Nine Heavens Flame, the Xuanyin Source Water, or using the three types of power of Regulation that the Black Tower had, but against this kind of “trash”, did he have to use such high-level techniques?

‘You want to be a coward, right? Fine!’

He shot out a foot. Peng, Fei Yun was instantly sent flying madly into the skies. Then, Ling Han summoned an iron spear—this was the wager that Mo Shuang had given to him, a Pseudo-Celestial Tool previously owned by someone he did not know. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xiu, Ling Han used the power of Space. His figure flashed, and crossed the dimension of space. In a few moves, he caught up to Fei Yun. Then, he struck out the spear in a direct stab, aimed straight at the latter’s behind.

“No!” Though Fei Yun was grabbing his head, when the divine sense of a Celestial expanded, what difference did it have with witnessing it with his own eyes?

This spear was going to rape his a*s!

His face had turned green. In complete public, in front of the eyes of many, if his a*s was raped by a spear, just how would he be able to continue living?

However, for the sake of protecting his vital points, he had curled himself into a tight ball, so how could he easily change the course of his flight? He hurriedly stretched out his body, wanting to use a movement technique. Even if he would suffer a blow to his thigh, he could not allow his a*s to suffer.

But his body had just stretched out when this strike had already reached him. Pu, half the spear had instantly directly sunk in.

...Who asked him to deliberately stretch out his body, as if he was welcoming the penetration of the iron spear?

“Ao...” he screamed in agony, his whole person stretching out into a straight line.

“Disgusting!” Ling Han hurriedly flicked his hands, and tossed Fei Yun out.

Peng, Fei Yun fell down from the skies, crashing heavily onto the ground, and producing a cloud of dust. He maintained a sprawled-out posture, while there was still a shaking spear that was stuck in his behind.

In truth, he had not fainted. This kind of attack was not strong enough to cause him serious injury, but the crux of the matter was that this was a humiliation, so he did not even dare to raise his head.

As a noble monarch tier, one that was ranked sixth even in the Wide Prosperity Heaven, he had actually been a*s-raped in public?

Instantly, everyone from the Wide Prosperity Heaven felt like they had a common enemy, turning their furious eyes on Ling Han, while feeling like Ling Han had humiliated the entire Wide Prosperity Heaven.

Public enemy!

Ling Han was unconcerned. Since they were going to fight over the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, he was going to defeat all order prodigies. ‘Even if you hate me, go ahead. Worse come to worst, I will just suppress all of you.’

However, even though they hated him, not one person jumped out to challenge Ling Han.

Fei Yun was a good example.

“Why isn’t Lord Yi here yet?”

“What about Fairy Shu?”

“How about Tang Minglong?”

The prodigies of the Wide Prosperity Heaven all called out loudly, their emotions excited.

Yi was the existence that was ranked at the top of Severing Mundane Tier in the Wide Prosperity Heaven. No one knew if it was his surname that was Yi or his actual name that was Yi, or if it was actually just an alias. He was an extremely mysterious person, but his strength was astonishingly amazing, and it was undebatable that he was ranked first.

Shu Yarong, the number one beauty of the Wide Prosperity Heaven, who was also number two in the rankings of Severing Mundane Tier. Meanwhile, Tang Minglong was ranked third.

The strength of these three was clearly a level stronger than the other monarch tiers’. Thus, the prodigies of the Wide Prosperity Heaven were sure that as long as these three arrived... any of them would be able to suppress Ling Han easily.

In such an excited atmosphere, no one noticed that Fei Yun had quietly dug a hole, and had already crawled in. Then, he dug deeper and deeper, climbed further and further. He had fled.

Ling Han walked back to his original spot, and saw that Yan Xianlu and the others were all looking excited.

“Brother Ling!”

“Brother Ling!”

“Lord Ling!

This was too awesome, standing up strongly for the Calm Peace Heaven! It should be known that ever since they had come, the people of the Wide Prosperity Heaven had all looked contemptuously at them, looking down very much on the Calm Peace Heaven.

But now?

Reality had smacked them hard in the face.

Weren’t the monarch tiers ranked sixth and ninth still sent off in defeat? Shi Xiuwen fortunately had run off fast enough, or he would be a*s-raped too.

They all discussed spiritedly, and everyone felt regretful that Shi Xiuwen had not been a*s-raped as well, which involuntarily made Ling Han sweat madly.

He probably hadn’t started a trend of a*s-raping, right?

That scene was too filthy and too violent, and he dared not think more about it.

“Too bad.” Even Hu Niu looked regretful. “Niu actually did not think of such a fun thing!” Her eyes lit up, and her gaze swept over the gathered masses from the Wide Prosperity Heaven, looking very much like she wanted to catch one of them for an experiment.

Not good, this girl was a curious kitten. He definitely could not allow her to learn such a despicable move.

Ling Han hurriedly wrapped Hu Niu in his arms, changing the topic to food. Instantly, Hu Niu was drooling, and she had successfully forgotten the action of a*s-raping that was completely unfit for girls to do.

So close.
