Chapter 355: Information about Mother

Translator: DarkAngel_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han sat down, holding Hu Niu in his arms. The little girl was acting spoiled and clinging to him without any intention of coming down from his arms. Meanwhile, Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan sat on either side of him. The four of them coincidentally occupied all four sides of the table. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Senior Brother Yue, looks like you will have to change how you address me in the future,” Ling Han said, laughing.

Yue Kai Yu felt like he was about to go crazy. He turned to Li Si Chan and said, “Has this guy promised you some benefits to make you sit here? Let me tell you, this guy is a liar; he’s both poor and ugly!”

To save his face as a senior brother, he did not care for anything else anymore and began to disparage Ling Han’s character.

Li Si Chan took off her face veil, and instantly, her delicate features were revealed. It was as if she herself was a deity, pleasing to anyone who saw her. She smiled faintly, and said, “I would have to disappoint Senior Brother Yue. I’m here of my own accord.”

Liu Yu Tong was not to be outdone, either, and she similarly removed her face veil and said, “So am I.”

The reason why they had worn face veils was simply because they had not wanted to attract unnecessary trouble with their outstanding beauty, but now that Ling Han had returned, there was naturally nothing for them to be afraid of.

Yue Kai Yu could not help but gape with his mouth wide open. He had long foreseen that these two girls were great beauties, but still had not expected that they would be beautiful to this level. They were not in the least bit inferior to Ao Zi Tai in terms of beauty. Thankfully, he was not the kind of man who would be completely unable to move upon seeing a beautiful girl. He very quickly returned to his senses, gave Ling Han a thumbs up, and said, “You’re awesome. I’m convinced!”

“Hehe, don’t you continue teasing Senior Brother Yue anymore,” Liu Yu Tong said to Ling Han.

Yue Kai Yu stared blankly for a moment before he immediately understood, and said, “So the two of them are your friends.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Senior Brother Yue is finally clever for once!”

“F*, I was just thinking how could your charms be so powerful that you’re able to abduct two great beauties upon your first meeting; so it appears that you know each other!” Yue Kai Yu shook his head repeatedly, but also heaved out a breath of relief.

It was not that he was not as charming as Ling Han, but there was another reason for his defeat. Furthermore, since they had known each other early on, then the bet they had made should of course not be taken seriously.

Ling Han was also just joking around with Yue Kai Yu. He turned to look at Liu Yu Tong, and asked, “Where are Big Brother Guang, Can Ye, and Wu Jiu?”

“Wu Jiu and Can Ye have already eaten, but Big Brother Guang...” Li Si Chan paused slightly. “He seems to have suffered some kind of blow, and has looked dispirited for quite a few days already.”

Ling Han nodded and said, “I’ll go take a look at him later. However, the important thing now is to make Senior Brother Yue drunk.”

“Why do you want to make me drunk?” Yue Kai Yu asked very innocently.

“Is it not worth getting drunk for the sake of seeing two such beautiful girls?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Hehe, then let’s get drunk!” Yue Kai Yu was an unrestrained person in the first place, and those with straightforward personalities usually tended to like drinking. Thus, he immediately smacked the table, and called out, “Waiter, get us some good wine.”

However, his lack of restraint did not persist for too long. With the repeated encouragements to drink from Ling Han and the others, he was soon completely drunk. He was swaying on his seat, and could not even distinguish how many people were on Ling Han’s side.

Ling Han reserved a room and helped Yue Kai Yu inside. He wanted to continue to probe for information for his mother’s location.

“... My aunt? My aunt is imprisoned in the Black Water Prison.” Now that Yue Kai Yu was drunk, he could not keep any secrets at all. He immediately answered when asked, which made Ling Han shake his head. In future, he should either keep him ignorant of any important matters, or ensure that Yue Kai Yu would not get drunk. Otherwise, it was as if this guy’s mouth had no closing, and would spill everything out.

“Where is the Black Water Prison? And what kind of environment is that?” Ling Han asked. At the same time, he felt anger. His mother was actually held in a prison, which made him almost go berserk and rage.

“The Black Water Prison is where the sect imprisons criminals; the majority of the inmates are enemies of our sect, but there are also disciples who have betrayed the sect.” Yue Kai Yu shook his head dizzily. “When I was little, I could still visit aunt, but those bastards from the Ao Clan kept squeezing us out. It was only three years ago that aunt was imprisoned into the Black Water Prison, and from then on, I could no longer visit aunt. Wu, wu, wu, my pitiful aunt. She is forced apart from her husband and child, and has been imprisoned in a place with complete darkness! These ** bastards from the Ao Clan, when I reach the Spiritual Infant Tier, I’ll strangle each one I see!”

Ling Han nodded. This cousin was on his side. “How are the defenses of the Black Water Prison?”

“You want to break into the prison? That’s impossible!” Yue Kai Yu shook his head repeatedly, as if he wanted to shake his head off his shoulders. “There are two elites of the Flower Blossom Tier who take turns to stand guard there, and even a fly would not be able to fly in without their knowledge!”

Ling Han could not help but tap the table in thought. It looked like that he would at least need to have the battle prowess of the Flower Blossom Tier before he would be able to break into the Black Water Prison and rescue his mother.

Damn, he obviously knew that his mother was currently suffering in prison, yet he could only sit by helplessly and watch.

Yue Kai Yu did not have too bad of a drunken disposition. He was not the type to behave wildly when drunk, and very soon, he had started snoring loudly. Ling Han walked out of the room and went to find Liu Yu Tong and the others.

Zhu Wu Jiu and Can Ye were already aware that he had come over, and had been waiting for him for some time.

Ling Han asked about their cultivation progress, drew out the Return Spirit Pills and passed them to them. He had never been a miser to his own people.

“Later, I will teach you some new martial arts techniques, you will only deserve the name of elites after you have strengthened your foundations in these techniques,” Ling Han said. Since these few people were going to follow him, he naturally had to ensure that their battle prowess would improve.

Ling Han then went to see Guang Yuan. That this originally very rough and brash guy would actually close himself up in his room like a girl was indeed quite strange.

He pushed open the door and entered, and saw Guang Yuan was sitting vacantly, his thoughts seeming to be far away.

“Big Brother Guang!” Ling Han stretched out a hand and waved it in front of him.

It was only later that Guang Yuan reacted. When he spotted Ling Han, he first experienced a scare, then looked alert before asking him doubtfully, “Ling Han?”

“It’s me.” Ling Han nodded. “What’s wrong with you? What are you thinking of that has entranced you so?”

Guang Yuan hesitated for a while. He looked like he both wanted to speak, yet also seemed as if he didn’t know where to start. In the end, he sighed, and said, “I met a person.”

“An old lover?” Ling Han asked, smiling. Otherwise, he would not need to look so vacant. In this world, perhaps only the word ‘love’ would induce such torment upon one.

Guang Yuan laughed bitterly, and said, “It’s my old lover’s man!”

Er... this kind of development did not seem to be very wonderful.

Now that Guang Yuan had brought up the topic, it seemed as if he wanted to vent the frustration he was feeling, and could no longer keep it inside anymore. He began to talk non-stop. “When I was still young and came out of Rain Country, I journeyed around in the north region in search of a way to become stronger.

During that period, I met two people, they were both loose cultivators. The three of us formed our own group and journeyed together all the while, experiencing life and death together. One was called Duan Zheng Zhi and the other was called Nong Qing Yue.

Duan Zheng Zhi and I were brothers, but both of us fell for Qing Yue simultaneously. To avoid damaging our brotherhood, we agreed to have a martial arts competition, and whoever lost would automatically withdraw.

In that half year’s time, I cultivated madly, and truly believed that I could defeat Duan Zheng Zhi. However, just a few days before our martial arts competition... Qing Yue came and told me that she has made her decision and chose Duan Zheng Zhi.

Thus, I naturally could only withdraw. However, not too long after, when Duan Zheng Zhi was drunk, I found out that he had used underhanded means and gotten Qing Yue, forcing her to have no choice but to choose him!

“My fury could not be restrained, and I gave Duan Zheng Zhi a severe thrashing. Then I went to find Qing Yue, and told her I did not care about the matter between her and Duan Zheng Zhi as long as she agreed to leave with me.

However, she did not agree. Downhearted, I decided to return to the Rain Country.

In a flash, close to twenty years had passed. A few days ago, I actually encountered Duan Zheng Zhi, yet he actually told me that Qing Yue has been dead for three years!”
