Chapter 2039: Hundred Dragons City

“F***, the Star Stones!” Only after Ling Han had been pulled out the main doors did Old Master Fu suddenly remember that the reason he had summoned Ling Han was to ask for the return of those 100,000,000 Star Stones. Yet, in the end, he had been conned by Ling Han into actually forgetting it.

“This brat is really sly!”

The old man shook his head repeatedly. However, with his status, once this matter was mentioned once, there naturally could not be a second mention.

Forget it. On the basis of Ling Han’s talent in alchemy, he would consider those 100,000,000 Star Stones as providing funding for him.

‘Right, an alchemy gathering will be held at Hundred Dragons City soon. Various prodigies from all over would be gathering, and this would not be a bad opportunity for this brat.

‘I shall write an introduction letter for this brat then, and lend him a helping hand.’

***

Fu Yue was really quite a generous person. After turning from enemies into friends with Ling Han, he brought Ling Han all over to play every single day, almost causing the Empress and Hu Niu to be displeased—could it be that he wanted to snatch their man from them?

Four days later, Fu Yue came to seek out Ling Han again.

“Brother Ling, Brother Ling, there is a great happy occasion, a great happy occasion.” This guy called out immediately upon entering the doors.

“What is it? Are you pregnant?” Ling Han asked with a laugh.

“You’re the one who’s pregnant, your whole family’s pregnant!” Fu Yue quickly countered. It was really easy to be led astray. He had only been around Ling Han for a few days, and this guy’s verbal ability had increased at least three times over.

Xiao Gu saw this with his eyes, heard this with his ears, and involuntarily mumbled. He was constantly learning.

“Where does this happiness come from?” Ling Han asked.

“My grandfather has given you a referral. You can go to Hundred Dragons City and attend a gathering of prodigies,” Fu Yue said.

“Oh, what kind of gathering?” Ling Han wasn’t very interested. Firstly, he wanted to go to the Universal Peace Heaven. Having missed a gathering of alchemy, no matter what, he still had to go to offer an explanation for his absence. Secondly, he had to ask around about which Heavenly Realm the Roc Palace was in.

Hundred Dragons City? Not interested.

“It is rumored that in ancient times, there were more than 100 Immortal Dragons buried in Hundred Dragons City. Afterwards, Hundred Dragons City was built on the site. This is a holy land. Every several hundred million years, the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles would be held there. It is said that the person who becomes champion would be instilled with the essence of the 100 dragons, and obtain endless benefits.

“At the same time, a gathering of alchemy would also be hosted. Countless alchemy prodigies would gather here, contesting for the chance to enter into the Ancient Alchemy Tower.”

Fu Yue explained excitedly. He did not have much interest in alchemy, and his main target was the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles.

Now, Ling Han was intrigued, and he asked, “What is the Ancient Alchemy Tower?”

“What? You don’t even know about the Ancient Alchemy Tower?” Fu Yue was surprised. Even he, someone who had just roughly learnt some scraps of alchemy, knew of the Ancient Alchemy Tower, yet Ling Han, this prodigy of alchemy, was actually completely blank.

“I don’t know.” Ling Han shook his head. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If he did not know, he did not know. There was nothing embarrassing about it.

“Brother Ling, you really are a strange person,” Fu Yue concluded, and explained, “The Ancient Alchemy Tower is an alchemy organization. Very, very long ago, it had been established by all the Five-Star Alchemists of that era.

“After a long time, the Ancient Alchemy Tower slowly turned from a loosely connected organization into a closely knit one. It is not only an alliance of only Five-Star Alchemists, but at the same time, it is also the Holy Land for the whole field of alchemy.

“For an alchemist, whether they had been approved by the Ancient Alchemy Tower or not would mean a world of difference!

“Now, every alchemist would consider it an honor to be granted entry into the Ancient Alchemy Tower.

“But every 100,000,000 years, only the top three winners of the alchemy tournament of the Hundred Dragons City would be qualified to join the Ancient Alchemy Tower. Though it is said that we, as Celestials, have close to an unlimited lifespan, this kind of entry quota is still pitifully few.

“Brother Ling, if you could enter into the Ancient Alchemy Tower, that would really be awesome. I guarantee that wherever you go, everyone will have to treat you politely.

“This is the strongest life-saving seal in the world.”

Ling Han gave an oh—so that was what the Ancient Alchemy Tower was.

“Where is Hundred Dragons City?” he asked.

“In the Universal Peace Heaven.”

Ling Han stared blankly. The Universal Peace Heaven?

Could it be that the place he and Ma Tongguang were to go to was Hundred Dragons City? However, the alchemy tournament would only be held once every 100,000,000 years, so the one previously definitely could not be this tournament.

In any case, he wanted to go to the Universal Peace Heaven, so it was convenient.

“I need a referral to attend that alchemy tournament?” he asked further.

“Of course.” Fu Yue nodded. “Just think, how many alchemists are there in this world? If there was no restriction, then wouldn’t the Hundred Dragons City be stuffed and burst?”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Then I really have to thank your grandfather.”

“Of course. Only a Four-Star Alchemist is qualified to provide a referral. Furthermore, he can only give a single referral,” Fu Yue said very matter-of-factly.

Pa

, immediately a smack landed on the back of his head.

He did not even have to look. It had to be Hu Niu.

“Ugly, what are you so proud about!” Indeed, Hu Niu’s voice rang out from behind him.

Ling Han gave an oh, and asked, “When do we set out?”

“Soon, within a month or so.”

Taking advantage of the time of this month or so, Ling Han asked the old master a few more times about alchemy, and also thanked him while he was at it.

Time passed very quickly, and soon it was time for departure.

“Yi, why are you coming along?” Ling Han looked at Fu Yue, appearing slightly surprised.

Fu Yue couldn’t help but feel depressed, and asked, “What do you mean by that? Do you think that because my strength is not as strong as yours, I am not qualified to attend the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles?”

Ling Han nodded honestly and without reservations. That was exactly what he thought.

“F***, though I am not a monarch tier, I am still an emperor tier. Could it be that I am not even qualified to participate?” Fu Yue retorted angrily.

“Participate?” Ling Han laughed. “You haven’t suffered enough, is that it?”

“F*ck off!”

There was no restriction on cultivation level for the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles, but there was an age requirement—the participants could not be older than 10,000,000 years old.

This age limit included the time that had been spent under time acceleration effects.

Thus, there really were not many people that could join.

Of course, there were also some mediocre people who would participate, believing in their good luck, and thinking that those who were stronger than them would be barred from the tournament due to age. However, reality would deliver a harsh slap onto their faces.

With the wealth of the Fu Clan, they naturally would not have them walk the whole way there, but rather prepared a means of travel. That was a Ground Piercing Shuttle. It did not fly in the skies, but tunneled through the ground.

The speed was similarly very fast, and there was no need for them to change course because of any obstruction in their way.

The body of the Ground Piercing Shuttle was covered with Earth Element formations. When it entered the ground, it was just like having entered water, or flying through air. There was only one word for it: fast.

The shuttle wasn’t big. This was to save on capital. After all, the larger the area that had to be covered with formations, the more expensive it would be.

In any case, they had Spatial God Tools, so there would not be much effect.

The majority of them entered into the Black Tower, and then the Ground Piercing Shuttle started, heading towards the Universal Peace Heaven.

This trip to the Universal Peace Heaven would take them through three Heavens, and use about seven months’ time, and this was still because the Ground Piercing Shuttle was high-grade enough, so its speed was naturally fast enough. Otherwise, if it was something more inferior, then it would be extremely normal for the time to be tripled or even quintupled.

Traveling underground, the chance of them encountering fellow travellers was naturally overwhelmingly low, and without encountering anyone, there naturally would not be any trouble. They successfully passed mountains and waters, heading all the way to the Universal Peace Heaven.

Of course, they would also encounter some minor twists and turns, such as an earthquake or landslide, which would cause some trouble on the journey, but it was only small trouble.

Slightly less than seven months later, they had finally arrived in the Universal Peace Heaven.
