Chapter 1111: Seeing Another Tower

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After heavens knew how long, Shui Yanyu realized that Ling Han had already opened his eyes, and was now gazing at her.

She suddenly became embarrassed, and she was just about to let go of him. However, she suddenly felt Ling Han’s arms wrap around her waist.

“Wife, let me lie here for a little longer,” Ling Han said in a muffled voice, his head buried in her bosom.

Shui Yanyu was both happy and embarrassed. However, her embarrassment still caused her to chide, “You’re already so old, why are you still acting so spoiled!”

Ling Han laughed loudly and nibbled at her breast. Only then did he stand up and say, “I feel so much better after having a nap.”

Although his vitality hadn’t recovered fully yet, it was not far from doing so.

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him. This man had truly become addicted to performing perverted acts on her. He really couldn’t control himself.

The Asura Demon Emperor had already returned, but he obediently stayed in the distance, not daring to take a peep.

Ling Han randomly ate some ginseng, ganoderma, and other medicines. When he finished, he said, “Let’s continue.”

“Don’t you need to rest for a little longer?” Shui Yanyu was still worried about Ling Han. His blood had just been sucked dry, after all, and it was difficult for him to recover even with his freakish recovery ability.

“I’m fine.” Ling Han cracked a smile. Then he scratched his head, and said, “However, what should I do if I come across the empress again?”

He had only spoken confidently before because he hadn’t realized that he had grabbed Empress Luan Xing’s breasts yet. However, if they met again in the future, he definitely wouldn’t be able to resist looking at Empress Luan Xing’s chest and recalling the feeling of grabbing it. Empress Luan Xing would probably go crazy if she saw this.

“Sigh, whatever!”

Shui Yanyu shook her head, and said, “If word of this gets out, I’m confident that you’ll even be hunted by the Eternity Sky Emperor and the Jade Drop Emperor.”

Two supreme rulers hunting a Mountain River Tier cultivator?

This sounded funny, yet there was a genuine possibility that it could happen. Who didn’t know that these two emperors loved and admired Empress Luan Xing? They had even indicated that they were willing to give her their respective Majestic Empires as dowry if she were willing to marry them.

And now, the goddess in their hearts had been indecently assaulted by another man. How could they not sentence him to death?

Ling Han counted using his fingers. With a chuckle, he said, “How many Heavenly Body Tier elites have I offended now?”

Shui Yanyu could only roll her eyes at him. Perhaps Ling Han was the only Mountain River Tier cultivator in the world who could attract the attention of so many Heavenly Body Tier elites. This left her both speechless and in admiration. Which other Mountain River Tier cultivator could achieve this?

Even Sun Moon Tier elites didn’t have the right to be remembered by so many Heavenly Body Tier elites, much less a small Mountain River Tier cultivator.

The two of them continued forward. After experiencing this life and death situation together, the feelings between them naturally became even stronger. They occasionally exchanged a sweet and loving glance. Thus, they didn’t feel bored as they walked, as their hearts would be filled with warmth whenever they glanced at their lover.

Just like before, they sent the Asura Demon Emperor to fight those they could defeat. If they came across an opponent that they couldn’t, they would avoid them or go into hiding for a while. Although the giant fish here were powerful, they didn’t possess intelligence, as they were unable to cultivate. Thus, it didn’t matter even if they discovered the secret of the Black Tower.

A dozen or so days passed, and a tower appeared in their sights.

It was a golden tower with nine levels, yet its height was such that it towered above the surface of the sea. It was extremely magnificent.

There were people entering the bottom level, yet there were also those who tried to enter the second and third levels. However, these people were all blasted back by a bolt of lightning when they neared the tower. Some were killed, while others were severely wounded.

It was evident that those who weren’t strong enough couldn’t enter from the higher levels of the tower. They could only enter from the bottom level.

“Let’s check it out,” Ling Han said.

The two people and one puppet walked over. The entrance on the bottom level of the tower was insanely big, with a height of 300 meters and a width of around 150 meters. It was large enough for several hundred people to enter at the same time.

Ling Han walked in, and the Asura Demon Emperor transformed into a small orb that was put away by Ling Han. This was to prevent him from having his identity exposed—his behavior didn’t conform to that of a puppet, after all.

“Brother Ling!” He heard someone shout at him.

Ling Han turned around, only to see that Shao Sisi, Du An, and the others had already arrived. Of course, the hateful Xia Wuque was also present.

Apart from these four young king tier cultivators, there were also another three people present. Their auras were just as powerful.

“Come, come, come, let’s introduce each other,” Du An said with a smile. He pointed at Ling Han, and said, “This is Ling Han, Brother Ling, the only person who was able to pass the stone statue formation!”

Upon hearing this, a stunned expression appeared on the three people’s faces. They couldn’t help but stare at Ling Han. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They hadn’t challenged the stone statue formation, as they had been traveling with the seniors from their clans before. They had indeed come across a stone statue formation. However, it had been either at the Sun Moon Tier or at the Heavenly Body Tier. They hadn’t even had the chance to challenge them.

However, this didn’t stop them from being aware of the terrifying nature of the stone statue formation.

From what they knew, no one had been able to pass. Even the older generation of Heavenly Body Tier elites had been defeated in the sixth and seventh stages.

According to those elites’ speculations, if one wanted to pass the stone statue formation, they had not only to reach the pinnacle of a major tier, but also to have a battle prowess that surpassed at least nine stars.

Was this possible?

However, there was an example of success right before their very eyes. How could they not be stunned and surprised? If it weren’t Du An who had told them, they would have treated such claims as utter nonsense.

“Ling Han, these three are Quan Lixuan, Luo Jingren, and Guan Rong. We’ll probably meet again soon at the Majestic Heaven Sect. At that time, we’ll be fellow apprentice brothers and sisters.”

Ling Han nodded, then clasped his hands, and said respectfully, “Greetings, everyone.”

The three people didn’t dare to show any disrespect. Judging by Ling Han’s prodigious talent, his background was most likely no weaker than theirs. Thus, they were all extremely respectful toward him.

Meanwhile, Xia Wuque sneered in disdain. He felt that Ling Han looked even more detestable now.

Being as smart as Quan Lixuan and the other two were, they instantly understood that there was animosity between Ling Han and Xia Wuque. However, their backgrounds were no weaker than that of Xia Wuque, and thus they naturally didn’t need to distance themselves from Ling Han out of fear of Xia Wuque.

“You guys arrived first, so did you figure out what’s up with this tower?” Ling Han asked.

“Haha, Brother Ling came just in time. We just happened to be forming a team now,” Su Jing said with a smile.

Meanwhile, Shao Sisi started to explain the situation, saying, “People need to form teams of 10 in order to enter this tower. Moreover, all team members need to have the same cultivation level 1 . Also, the entire team will be eliminated once any single member of the team fails. Not only that, but there’s only one opportunity as well.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. No wonder these prodigies were all waiting here—they wanted to ensure that they succeeded.

One prodigy mightn’t necessarily be strong enough to carry nine weaker team members. This wouldn’t matter if they could start again after failing. After all, they could gain experience from their failure. However, this tower only gave people one chance to enter—they would be barred from entering again if they failed the first time. Thus, it was no surprise that everyone was especially careful.

“What do we get for passing the trial of this tower?” Ling Han asked.

Xia Wuque sneered again. ‘What a sordid person who only thinks of benefits and whatnot. Don’t you think that the goal of supreme prodigies is to complete feats that others cannot?’

“No idea,” Shao Sisi said with a shake of her head. “Those who failed have already come out. They can stay here to observe, but they can’t form another team to try again. There are also some people who haven’t reappeared yet. Perhaps they’ve entered the second, third, or even ninth level.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!”
