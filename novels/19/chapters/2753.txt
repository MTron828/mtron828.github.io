2754 Killed

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was very domineering.

‘I have said so, so that is the heaven, that is the earth, and that is the law.’

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Unfortunately, you are not yet qualified for that.” He lowered his head and looked at the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate beneath his foot, asking, “Let me ask you. Do you have any regrets?”

In full public like this, even if the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate felt reservations, there was no way that he would show weakness. Immediately, he raised his head high, and declared, “Whatever I do, I feel no guilt towards heaven and earth, so what regrets would I have?”

“Very good.” Ling Han nodded, and then raised his foot.

Everyone thought that he would be letting him go, and gave an “oh” mentally. After all, this was the Promise City Realm. No matter how fierce the dragon passing through was, they would have to be wary of the local tyrant.

Pa!

But they had not even finished this thought when they saw Ling Han’s foot had already descended, directly stomping the head of the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate into mush.

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’

That was a Heavenly Venerate, and his head had actually been destroyed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Everyone watched with wide eyes, their faces filled with disbelief.

However, Heavenly Venerates were too strong. Even if his mind had shattered, he had not died yet. Instead, a soul flew out, turning into a sphere of light. This light sphere was flickering with lightning, revealing the face of the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

He glared harshly at Ling Han, his eyes filled with fury and venom.

For Heavenly Venerates, the physical body was extremely important because they extracted the power to temper their physical bodies. Without the support of a physical body, the soul was a fish out of water, and was incredibly weak.

Of course, if he snatched another body for himself, it was not impossible for him to cultivate again to Heavenly Venerable Tier, but that would definitely require an endless amount of time.

“How dare you!!” The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was enraged. Ling Han actually dared kill in front of him. Just what great and brazen insolence was this? What did he take him for?

“What would I not dare?” Ling Han continued to move, grabbing out towards the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate. Since he had declared that he would kill him, there was no way he would give up halfway.

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate naturally could not tolerate this. Immediately, he charged out, wanting to rescue the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

Allowing Ling Han to commit a crime once was already extremely embarrassing for him, so how could he allow Ling Han to commit another offense?

Boom! The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han, his blow bearing an incomparably vast and powerful might.

Ling Han was unafraid, and met the incoming attack with a punch.

The two great elites exchanged blows once, which instantly created a shock wave that seemed capable of destroying worlds.

Peng, peng, peng! Everyone around them were involuntarily sent flying.

The most unfortunate among them had to be the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate. Initially, he had naturally had no fear of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate-level shock wave, but now he was only left with a soul, which was incredibly fragile. This was his fate.

He hurriedly extracted the power of heaven and earth, forming a defensive barrier in front of him—drawing on the power of heaven and earth was naturally no issue for him.

Peng!

He was too close to them, and his defense was actually shattered by this shock wave directly. As the aftermath surged, his soul was also ripped, and the pain could not be described. If it was not for the fact that he no longer had a physical body, he would definitely be throwing up copious amounts of blood by now.

“Y-y-you…” The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate paled in great shock. He hurriedly retreated over 50 km away, his eyes set on Ling Han, filled with astonishment and terror.

That was because he had discovered that Ling Han had not drawn on the power of heaven and earth at all.

There were three possibilities for this.

Firstly, Ling Han was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate from another dimension, so there was naturally no way he could draw on the unique power of this dimension.

Secondly, he was deliberately using only the power of his physical body.

The chance of the third possibility being true was completely zero, but it was that Ling Han was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, so there was naturally no way he could draw on the power of heaven and earth.

But whatever was the case, his power should be incredibly weaker than that of the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate. How could it be that the former fought him to a tie with a single strike? In fact, the former even seemed slightly superior in their clash?

How could this be understood?

“Who exactly are you?” the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate asked. If the Martial Crystalline Realm had had this kind of freak, what need would there have been for them to slowly progress with their invasion? They could completely unleash a full invasion.

Kuang!

Right at this moment, a reaction came from the heaven and earth, striking madly at the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, and Ling Han, on the other hand, was completely fine.

“P-Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate’s mouth was wide, looking like he had seen a ghost.

It was not that he had not considered this possibility, but the chance of this was close to zero in his mind. Hehe, wasn’t it a joke for a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to be capable of matching a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate? Was there anything even more exaggerated than this in this world?

But the heaven and earth had targeted him, and ignored Ling Han completely, so wasn’t this the best proof?

Beneath them, a commotion had also risen among the crowd. How could they believe this?

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate was filled with even more disbelief. If it was true that his physical body had been destroyed by a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, then wouldn’t he become the greatest joke in all history?

Ling Han did not answer. Xiu! His figure moved, and he continued his charge towards the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

He was going to establish his might.

“Stop!” The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate hurriedly pounced towards him. Whether it was for his own reputation, or for the sake of the dimension, he naturally could not let Ling Han kill a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, ignoring the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate completely. He was hell-bent on attacking the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate tried all means to stop him, but his strength was not superior to Ling Han’s in the first place, especially when mistakes would be made during an extensive period of defense. Even if he blocked a thousand, ten thousand blows from Ling Han, as long as even one blow made it through and landed, the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate would definitely be killed.

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was very gloomy in this battle. He had never been so tired, and he felt as if he had power, but it could not be used the way he wanted.

Even if he continuously saved the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate, the latter was still severely wounded, his soul being torn many times, and endlessly became weaker.

If things went on like this, it would not take too long before the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate would die.

‘No.’ The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate’s eyes turned, setting on Ling Jianxue and the others. ‘Since you can attack the weaker person, I naturally can as well.’

They could just hold hostages over each other so that the other party would not hurt the hostage that they had captured.

This thought flashed through his mind, and he immediately pounced towards Ling Jianxue and the others.

Ling Han humphed. “You wish to die as well?”

His figure turned, and set off in pursuit of the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate. However, with a wave of his right hand, xiu, a cold light surged out, shooting towards the soul of the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate had just sighed in relief. He had not expected that Ling Han would actually strike a blow against him now, scaring him so much that he hurriedly drew on the power of heaven and earth to defend himself.

This time, there was no Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate to help him out of the crisis, so he had to do it himself.

Pu!

Yet, the defensive shield formed from the power of heaven and earth was completely useless against this cold strike, and a sword was seen piercing towards him.

‘A Heavenly Venerate Tool!’ The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate exclaimed inwardly. He was a newly promoted Heavenly Venerate, and had not yet forged his own Heavenly Venerate Tool. Otherwise, he would have used it long ago.

He had just barely finished the thought when the stab from the Divine Demon Sword reached him. The soul was extremely fragile in the first place, so how could it possibly withstand the sharpness of a Heavenly Venerate Tool? His soul was immediately pierced through.

Under the calamitous destructive power of a Heavenly Venerate Tool, the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate’s soul was immediately destroyed. He released a wave of dimension power, which instantly spread throughout this entire dimension.

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate had died!

There was no empathetic grief from the heaven and earth or any shower of blood. Heavenly Venerates were not under the control of the heaven and earth. Rather, they were hated and envied by the heaven and earth, so there were naturally no unnatural phenomena to be seen.

Xiu! Ling Han had already come close. He threw a punch, and the Five Elements Lightning Technique channeled, blasting towards the back of the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate.

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate could not ignore this. If he was struck by Ling Han with a Heavenly Venerate Technique, his physical body might immediately crumble, just like the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate.

He turned around. Peng! He sent out a palm strike, parrying this punch from Ling Han.

However, Ling Han’s steps took an abrupt turn, and he immediately appeared in front of Ling Jianxue, Helian Xunxue, and the others. With a wave of his hand, he instantly took all four of them into the Celestial Guest Residence.

Then, he turned around, and faced the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate.
