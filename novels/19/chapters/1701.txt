Chapter 1702: Where is Tong Lin?

Every new person who arrived would excitedly talk about the explosive event that they had witnessed, but cold water would be immediately poured on them. Wasn’t it just something as minor as public s*x?

But this Tong Lin was really outrageously bold in his lust to actually dare have public s*x in Changsun Liang’s official residence, tsk!

He was destined to be in trouble. Everyone naturally couldn’t be bothered to waste time on him, and they were all minding their own business, connecting with friends that they had not seen for a very long time, or developing new friendships—Black Moon City was really too big. Ordinarily, everyone indeed rarely had the chance to gather together.

More and more people arrived. The actual host, Changsun Liang, had yet to appear, but the Empress had already become the center of attention, everyone gathering around her firstly to gain her favor, and secondly to make discreet enquiries about exactly which large sect the Empress originated from.

The Empress didn’t even bother to respond, and it was Ling Han who became her spokesperson, dispatching everyone who had come. However, he did not coldly offend anyone. Who knew, these people might be of use in future. Furthermore, they hadn’t offended them, either, so what need was there for him to insult them?

Right after more than an hour had passed, Changsun Liang finally arrived.

“The arrival of the Holy Son!” With a soft exclamation, the whole main hall immediately became silent.

Light footsteps were heard, and a young man wearing a purple gold crown was striding out of a set of doors. His figure was broad and tall, and his eyes were very bright, as if they were two suns, and no one dared to stare at them.

His bearing was also incredibly strong, especially within the diameter of three feet away from him. His aura had solidified, and turned into multiple True Dragons, True Phoenixes, and other Divine Beasts like Qilin and Black Tortoises, which were endlessly turning over around him.

And that red-haired young man stood behind him, a fanatical expression on his face, as if Changsun Liang was a god instead of a human being in his eyes.

“Our respects to the Holy Son!” A considerable number also knelt down, and the others stood up as well as they clasped their hands in respect.

This was an unmatched king tier, with talent so high he was first in a Two Star force. He would not be afraid of even a prodigy that had walked out from a Three Star City, and could match, or even surpass, the latter.

Of course, neither Ling Han nor the Empress stood. With their pride, how could they possibly bend at the waist to a cultivator that was their equal?

This caused those in the surroundings to feel uneasy. If the Holy Son became angered, would they also be cracked down on?

“Rise!” Changsun Liang stated calmly, pressing down with his hands, indicating that everyone could sit back down. His eyes swept over Ling Han and the Empress, and a smile curled his lips as he greeted her with clasped hands. “Fairy Luan Xing!”

The Empress did not even look directly at him, and only nodded slightly. She had greeted him.

It was this kind of prideful attitude that caused everyone to firmly believe that the Empress had to be the Holy Daughter of some great sect.

...Neither my strength nor natural talent was inferior to yours, and my status was more noble, so I could naturally put on airs.

Changsun Liang could be said to have been mildly rebuffed, but he appeared to be very magnanimous, and broke into a smile, as amiable as a spring breeze. “Come, I have prepared some wine and food, so do not be reserved, everyone.”

His eyes swept over the gathered masses, and his brow wrinkled slightly. That was because practically all the seats in the main hall were occupied, and there was only one person missing.

...Tong Lin.

He had already appeared, yet Tong Lin was not here yet. He was putting on even greater airs than himself?

Changsun Liang couldn’t help but show a hint of displeasure, and asked, “Where is Tong Lin?”

Pu!

Some people had already begun to drink, and when they heard this, they spluttered, and coughs rang out.

‘What’s going on?’

Changsun Liang looked at the side. The red-haired young man understood his meaning, and immediately nodded in respect. He descended the stage, and after some enquiries, his expression suddenly became extremely strange.

Tong Lin was actually having public s*x in the bushes right outside the entrance!

‘Just how many f**king years have you not seen a woman that you have such a fierce craving?’

The red-haired young man hurriedly returned to the stage, and whispered lowly by Changsun Liang’s ear.

He had not even finished his words when Changsun Liang couldn’t help but look furious. He almost slammed his hand on the table and stood up in indignant rage.

That bastard, Tong Lin, was actually having public s*x in his garden? Furthermore, it had become a publicly known fact? T-t-this, wasn’t this a public humiliation to him? How outrageously bold of him!!

It could not be said that Changsun Liang’s composure was weak—this matter was indeed infuriating. It was just like someone had purposely crapped in your bed. Whose face would not turn dark at that?

However, Changsun Liang did not fly into a temper. He only acted as if he had not discovered this matter, and greeted his guests.

He was the Holy Son, destined to inherit the position of sect master in future, so he was naturally an expert of guiding the mood. Very soon, he made everyone forget the matter of Tong Lin, and the topics of conversations were within his control.

Changsun Liang was very interested in the Empress. After all, this was the only young king tier that was capable of matching him. Furthermore, her identity was very mysterious, and she could possibly be the Holy Daughter of some great sect!

Just ask, who would not like such a woman whose natural talent was nature-defying and had a noble status, a perfect figure, and an unmatched bearing?

Even if she had not shown her face, the Empress had already conquered the hearts of innumerable people.

“Fairy Luan Xing, after we finish later, would you be interested in studying the art of cultivation with me?” Changsun Liang was not reserved at all, and began a fierce “offensive” towards the Empress.

The Empress couldn’t even be bothered to pay him any regard. If Changsun Liang had said that he wanted to spar with her, she might be more interested in battling.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “My Luan Luan never spends time alone with strangers. If Brother Changsun is insistent, I can do so on her behalf.”

You? How would you do so on her behalf?

Changsun Liang showed a sliver of displeasure. The words “my Luan Luan” pierced his heart painfully. But what could be done? What position did he have to refute Ling Han’s words?

A thought flashed in his head, and he immediately had an idea. He turned to look at the red-haired young man, and communicated a message through his divine sense. Then, he smiled, and said, “In a meeting of us cultivators, how could we not have any spars and competitions of martial arts?”

“The Holy Son speaks true.” Everyone nodded, naturally not daring to undermine his plans.

“Ling Han, I challenge you!” The red-haired young man immediately stood up, and called out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was surprised. At first, he only wanted to be a quiet young man, have some food and wine, and meet the young prodigies of Black Moon City, but someone actually wanted to challenge him? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

En, he didn’t show his true prowess yesterday, so others thought he would make a good target?

“Sure.” He nodded, all smiles.

“Chi Long, be appropriate in your strikes. Do not kill anyone,” Changsun Liang said to the red-haired young man.

The red-haired young man understood. This was Changsun Liang’s command. As long as he did not kill anyone, there was no need for him to hold anything back. He nodded, and respectfully replied, “Yes, Lord Holy Son.”

He leaped out of the main hall, and called out, “Ling Han, come out for a battle!”

Ling Han picked up a mouthful of food with his chopsticks and sipped some wine first. Then, he turned to the Empress, and said, “Wife, I will be back soon.”

The Empress nodded gently, and then took the initiative to kiss him.

This scene caused everyone to almost die of envy. At first, they had thought that the Empress was a beauty of ice that was cold and proud, yet they had never thought that she would smile in such a dazzling manner for a man, as gentle as ******.

‘This guy who has gotten so f***** lucky, go and die quickly!’
