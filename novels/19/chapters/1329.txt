1330 The Chance Has Come

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden knew that Ling Han possessed a freakish physique, yet she definitely hadn’t envisioned that it was actually this freakish.

“Don’t make trouble, can’t you see that I’m busy?” Ling Han said to the sky, a smile on his face. He then lowered his head and kissed the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, whose dainty mouth was still agape with astonishment.

Kuang! Kuang! Kuang!

Heaven was furious, furious that someone dared to interfere in someone else’s heavenly tribulation. This was a challenge to heaven and earth. The devastating arcs of divine lightning instantly formed a dense net that crashed down on Ling Han.

Only at this moment did Ling Han let go of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She would still need to face her own heavenly tribulation as this was integral if one wanted to stabilize their cultivation’s foundations. However, he still stood guard beside her so that he could help her dissolve any fatal dangers. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This would be an impossible task for anyone else—even Saints couldn’t achieve this. When one was faced with heavenly tribulation that corresponded to their cultivation level, they would face the danger of death, regardless of how talented they were.

However, Ling Han was an exception. His physique was unbelievably powerful, meaning that he was fully capable of interfering in others’ heavenly tribulations. The worst thing that could happen was that he would also have to face his own heavenly tribulation. As long as he didn’t interfere in a heavenly tribulation of Heavenly Body Tier elites or Eternal River Tier elites, he was completely capable of overcoming tribulations for anyone else.

‘Perhaps I can make a business out of this. Maybe I’ll charge some Godly metal every time I dissolve a tribulation for a low-level Immortal?’ Ling Han was truly poor, so much so that such a thought actually flashed through his mind.

‘Forget about it. That’ll be far too eye-catching. Being noticed by too many people isn’t a good thing.’

Ling Han quickly shook his head, shooting this idea down. He decided to earn money through alchemy instead. Dissolving heavenly tribulation for others would attract far too much attention. More importantly, he might draw the ire of heaven if he helped too many people dissolve their tribulation. What if heaven suddenly unleashed an Eternal River Tier or Genesis Tier heavenly tribulation to dispose of him?

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden moved a suitable distance apart so that they could each face their own tribulation.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was facing an ordinary pinnacle level heavenly tribulation. Meanwhile, Ling Han had not only intruded on her heavenly tribulation, but he had even helped the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden block a strike. Thus, the heavenly tribulation that he faced... was a whopping 10 times more powerful!

However, it was only 10 times. Ling Han was completely unafraid.

Right now, his physique was already as tough as Level Nine Godly metal, perhaps even a tiny bit stronger. Thus, there was absolutely no need for him to fear this kind of heavenly tribulation. However, this also revealed another piece of information—being swept into someone else’s tribulation wasn’t scary, but interfering in it was. If one dared to interfere in someone else’s heavenly tribulation, they would face a tribulation that was several times more powerful!

However, Ling Han wasn’t sure whether it would necessarily be 10 times more powerful. Perhaps it would become more powerful the more times he interfered?

In any case, he decided not to make a business out of this.

‘It’s probably best to show some respect to heaven and earth,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He didn’t shatter his Godly bones this time, so he was naturally relaxed and at ease as he faced heavenly tribulation. He observed the workings of the tribulation and transformed these observations into his own comprehension. The lightning divine pattern on his right hand became increasingly complicated, resonating with the rhythm of the great dao.

Half a day passed, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden successfully overcame her tribulation, becoming a genuine pinnacle level king tier!

If one didn’t advance to the pinnacle level, they couldn’t be regarded as a king tier, even if they had reached the pinnacle level in a previous tier. They would fall off the platform of king tiers and become someone who was slightly more powerful than ordinary prodigies.

This was the reality of cultivation. If one didn’t advance, they would quickly be surpassed.

Right now, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was giddy with joy. Not in her wildest dreams had she imagined that she would one day reach the pinnacle level! Although she hadn’t reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier—meaning that she would only be able to surpass nine stars at most, not 10 stars—she was still beside herself with delight.

Ling Han leaned toward her as he said, “Congratulations, Wife! Come, give me a kiss.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden wasn’t Shui Yanyu, and she immediately began to resist. However, how could she suppress Ling Han? It wasn’t long before she was held down and passionately kissed by Ling Han.

“Little rascal, you’re bullying me!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden chided softly. There was a watery glimmer in her beautiful eyes, making her appear especially beautiful and charming.

Ling Han almost howled like a lustful wolf. Even his eyes had become red with excitement. However, it was a shame that his body was only 10 years old, meaning that he had absolutely no ability to do anything more. He was so devastated that he hammered the ground with his fists, his expression as if he wanted to murder someone.

“What’s wrong?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked in concern.

“It’s nothing, I just want some peace and quiet.”

***

In a month, Ling Han could temper his body in the immortal flames again. After that, he could ingest a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill for one last time. His cultivation would reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level, and at that time, all he would need to do was comprehend dao in seclusion. Once he comprehended the profound mystery of heavenly bodies, he would have obtained the ability to advance to the next major tier.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden immediately ingested a Berserk Blood Spirit Pill and raised her cultivation to the next level.

In just three short days, she advanced one sub-minor level. This made her sigh with emotion. This was the benefit of following an alchemist. The rapid speed of her cultivation would definitely attract jealousy!

Ling Han still had a vial of the Rock Spirit’s spiritual liquid on him. However, this spiritual liquid was a Heavenly Body Tier treasure, so it would be a huge waste if he drank it now. Moreover, it would clash with the effects of the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill. As such, it was probably best to leave it until he reached the Heavenly Body Tier.

The two of them returned to the area surrounding the ancient coffin. This was truly a strange situation. Ding Zizhen had said that he wanted someone to rescue his daughter, yet he didn’t even allow them to see his daughter, so how on earth were they supposed to rescue her?

Anyhow, Ling Han had already learned Tide of the Ages, so he naturally wasn’t interested in Ding Zizhen’s reward anymore. The only reason he remained here was for the golden sand. It was an incredibly valuable item, and he could sell it for good money. In addition, the symbols on the ancient coffin were also genuinely useful. Observing them could elevate his comprehension of the great dao.

“Hahaha, I’m going to break through!” someone exclaimed.

This wasn’t a surprising situation. The ancient coffin could aid one’s comprehension, so during the past six months, many people had already overcome barriers that had held them down for a long time, and advanced to a new cultivation level. In fact, they could sense the commotion of someone facing heavenly tribulation every few days.

However, the higher one’s cultivation, the harder it would be to overcome the barriers between each cultivation level. This was evident from the fact that no Eternal River Tier elite had broken through. Perhaps they would need to cultivate here for a dozen years or several thousand years before they could break through.

To elites like them, breaking through within 1,000,000 years would already be a delightful surprise!

The excited exclamation of this person instantly attracted the envious gazes of many people.

Ling Han glanced over, and a cold glint instantly flashed through his eyes.

That was Xie Donglai!

He was on the verge of breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier. The sparks of starry light that subtly flashed around his body were the clearest evidence of this. Moreover, he would also be the first person to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier in these past six months.

The reason for this was simple. First of all, he was indeed a prodigy of the younger generation. Second of all, he had already been stuck at this bottleneck for an extremely long time. Thus, with the help of the ancient coffin, he was finally able to overcome this bottleneck and soar toward the next major tier.

“Hahahaha!” Xie Donglai was smug with joy as he speedily ran away. As arrogant as he was, he still didn’t dare to face heavenly tribulation here and risk affecting the others. Even if there weren’t Eternal River Tier elites here, he still wouldn’t dare to anger everyone. After all, a punch from each person would be more than enough to kill him.

As he sped away, he saw Ling Han out of the corner of his eyes. Killing intent involuntarily flashed across his eyes. Once he broke through, Ling Han would be the first person that he killed. After that, he would kill Faceless. The former had stolen his woman, and the latter had dared to humiliate him!

They both deserved to die!

His speed was incredible as he raced further and further from the coffin.

No one from the Xie Clan followed behind him. The only danger in facing heavenly tribulation came from the tribulation itself. After all, who dared to charge into someone else’s heavenly tribulation? Even if someone did dare to do this, they would simply be swept into the tribulation themself. That being the case, would they still have the ability to make trouble?

Thus, heavenly tribulation was both the most dangerous and the safest event at the same time.

Ling Han suddenly stood up. His chance had come.
