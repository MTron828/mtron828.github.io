2895 Killing Fei Wu

First-grade seal!

Heavenly Venerable Seals were rare, and only the more widely known had appeared in the world. Otherwise, when Ling Han had obtained a seventh-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal in the Realm Battlefield, it would have been impossible for so many Heavenly Venerate to come knocking on his door to demand it.

One could imagine how astonishing a first-grade seal was. It would greatly increase the strength of a Heavenly Venerate. To say nothing of the fact that a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate would go crazy over it, even a Seventh Tier would be envious.

“A junior like you can really give people a surprise,” Qi Xuan said with a smile.

In his opinion, even if Ling Han possessed a first-grade seal, it would not be enough to strike fear in him, because if he and Fei Wu joined forces, they could completely stop Ling Han. At most, they would only be at a disadvantage.

Worse came to worst, they would definitely be able to endure it for two hours.

He didn’t believe that Ling Han still had a second first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal.

“Oh?” Ling Han smiled faintly. “Surprise? I thought you were going to say shock.”

“Haha, you can’t even imagine the trials and tribulations I’ve gone through in my life. Do you think you can scare me with just this?” Qi Xuan said coldly, appearing extremely disdainful.

He was a supreme elite of the Fifth Tier. Which of those who could reach this level wasn’t a supreme elite of the world?

Fei Wu stood at the sidelines, and didn’t rush him. Ling Han was still channeling this first-grade seal, so they were naturally happy for Ling Han to exhaust the energy of this seal for nothing.

It would be best if they could stall for two hours like this. Then, he and Qi Xuan would be able to easily take Ling Han’s head, and it was not just a single Heavenly Venerable Seal they would obtain from him.

At this moment, he was already thinking about how he could snatch that first-grade seal. It was too precious.

Ling Han was not in a hurry, either. The first-grade seal was his trump card?

Wrong.

Qi Xuan actually dared to say that it was a surprise? Hehe, he would let the other party know that this was definitely a shock and a nightmare.

He stopped channeling the Heavenly Venerable Seal in his body. They wanted him to waste the power for nothing? Hehe, he wasn’t stupid.

Seeing this, Qi Xuan and Fei Wu both frowned. It seemed that they could only fight and force Ling Han to use all of his ultimate moves. After exhausting this first-grade seal, Ling Han finally could only be at their mercy.

The two of them originally had their own intentions, thinking about how they could obtain that first-grade seal after Ling Han’s death. However, they had yet to deal with Ling Han, so it was still too early to think about these things.

“Take this brat down!”

“All right!”

The two of them set aside their petty schemes, and charged towards Ling Han. They channeled their Heavenly Venerable Seals, and unleashed all their secret techniques, attacking Ling Han without holding anything back.

Ling Han let out a long cry, and once again channeled that first-grade seal, clashing with the two Fifth Tier elites.

Peng, peng, peng! His strength was invincible. Qi Xuan and Fei Wu were like paper figurines in front of him. They were sent flying by his casual punches and kicks. Soon, they were covered in wounds.

If this had been any other opponent, they would definitely have already retreated. If they continued to be injured like this, it might affect their foundations and affect their future advancement to a higher cultivation level.

But now, they couldn’t retreat.

Ling Han was only a Third Tier. Furthermore, the Heavenly Venerable Seal was only effective for a limited time. As long as they could endure Ling Han’s wave of dominance, it would be their turn to display their might.

With such thoughts in mind, they gritted their teeth and persevered. A first-grade seal was definitely worth the risk.

Ling Han naturally knew what they were thinking. Unfortunately, these two people didn’t know that Ling Han was already leading them around by the nose.

The two elites held on with all their might. Finally, two hours had passed.

The seal on Ling Han’s body quickly dimmed. The energy release had ended, and it could no longer be used.

“Brat, your death is here!”

Qi Xuan and Fei Wu both channeled another sixth-grade seal; their battle prowess was almost unaffected.

Hahaha, they finally made it to this moment.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “You guys are celebrating too early. You still don’t know who the prey is, do you?”

“Are you trying to say that you still have other trump cards?” Qi Xuan said disdainfully.

“Don’t tell me you have a second first-grade seal?” Fei Wu also laughed.

“Open your eyes wide and watch!” Ling Han let out a long cry. Weng, weng, weng, densely packed seals flashed out of his body, and there were at least 100 of them.

Qi Xuan and Fei Wu were both shocked. They had not expected Ling Han to actually have mastered so many Heavenly Venerable Seals. However, what was the use of having so many? They were not combination seals, so how much power could they unleash?

“You are just bluf—”

Peng!

Before Fei Wu could finish speaking, he had already been struck by Ling Han’s fist. He raised his fist to meet it, but his arm exploded upon contact with this force. The remaining force did not dissipate, and a hole was instantly blasted into his chest.

The cold smile on Qi Xuan’s face immediately disappeared. What a terrifying power. A single punch had broken through Fei Wu’s defense and penetrated through his body.

The late stage of the Fifth Tier? Or the peak stage?

Ling Han took advantage of his victory to follow up with another series of Fists of Fury towards Fei Wu.

Qi Xuan hurriedly made his move, wanting to exert pressure for Ling Han so that Fei Wu could catch his breath.

However, Ling Han didn’t even turn around. With a single punch, Qi Xuan was sent flying. All the bones in his body were creaking, and he couldn’t stop trembling for a long time, as if he was about to shatter.

On the other side, the pressure on Fei Wu was even greater. Ling Han had already closed the distance between them completely, and his fists were firing down on Fei Wu, forcing the latter to raise his hands to block. Otherwise, he would definitely die.

However, Ling Han’s strength was simply too great. In just two or three punches, his other arm had also turned into a rain of blood.

He gritted his teeth and forcibly regenerated his arms.

At the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier, even though one’s strength was inconceivably powerful, and one’s physique was also incomparably tough, one’s self-healing ability was actually inferior to that of a Celestial King.

What was this about?

Because Heavenly Venerates surpassed Regulations, celestial medicine was completely ineffective for them. If they wanted to forcefully regrow their lost limbs, there was only one way—use their own blood essence to stimulate the growth.

If a Heavenly Venerate expended a large amount of blood essence, they would also be severely injured. In serious cases, it wouldn’t even be strange if their cultivation level dropped; forget trying to break through to a higher cultivation level.

...

However, Fei Wu had no other choice. If he didn’t regenerate his arms, his torso and mind would be the ones to be blown apart. If one died, everything would be for naught.

Peng, peng, peng, his arms continued to regenerate, and then to be continuously blown apart. This seemed to allow him to struggle at death’s door, but Ling Han’s strength was truly too terrifying. Not only did he shatter Fei Wu’s arms, but the recoil also affected the latter’s entire body.

Soon, Fei Wu was vomiting blood repeatedly, and his resistance became weaker and weaker.

“Ling Han!” Qi Xuan charged over from a distance. He had been punched by Ling Han, and it was only now that he managed to suppress the boiling in his body and charge back.

Ling Han ignored him, and his punches became more and more violent. Peng, peng, peng, peng! Fei Wu finally couldn’t keep up with his rhythm, and was blasted into bits.

A Fifth Tier elite had fallen! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qi Xuan was already closing in. Upon seeing this, he turned around and left without hesitation.
