2993 As It Turns Out…

It was clearly another power that had forcefully funneled the marks of life into Chong Yan and the others’ bodies.

‘So why did Chong Yan and the other lie?

‘What’s the reason behind all this?

‘Hang on… Why could that power remain effective during the destruction of the Genesis World?

‘Seventh Tier?

‘The Seventh Tier elites were already forced into a slumber, so how could they still channel such power?

‘Perhaps… It was a power that exceeded the Seventh Tier?’

Ling Han shook his head. As powerful as Hysteria was, it was still nothing more than a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. It hadn’t reached the so-called Eighth Tier. This was because only six fundamental powers existed in the world. Thus, the Seventh Tier would be the limit.

Moreover, even the Genesis World had been destroyed, and this was a destructive power that could kill even Seventh Tier elites. So, what being could be transcendent above this?

The images suddenly vanished, and this left Ling Han scratching his head. Who had unleashed that power?

Or perhaps these images had been tampered with, and they weren’t actually the historical truth?

‘Is this possible?’

Ling Han shook his head. He had always protected himself using the Powers of Dimension, and even Seventh Tier elites wouldn’t be able to wound him. Moreover, these images had been placed inside his mind without his knowing.

In other words, it was just like the mysterious voice had said. All of these images had been inside his mind and soul the entire time. They had simply been triggered after he arrived at this place.

“What are you trying to tell me?” Ling Han asked.

The ancient voice sounded again, stuttering, “Ahead… Orb of light… Everything…”

Ling Han looked at the speck of light in the distance. This was where the ancient voice in his mind wanted him to go?

All of the answers lay there?

Ling Han strode forward, dashing toward the speck of light at an incredible speed.

He channeled the Power of Dimension.

Weng!

Boom!

With a flap, his speed increased drastically, so much so that he could even rival Seventh Tier ultimate elites.

However, even though the speck of light was within view, it was actually boundlessly far away. After flying for seven days and nights, the speck of light still appeared as small as before. It didn’t show any signs of becoming larger.

‘Just how far away is it?’

Ling Han continued to soar forward. Another 10 days passed, and the speck of light finally started to grow.

‘I’m getting closer.’

Even so, it still took Ling Han another three days to truly approach the orb of light.

This orb of light only measured 30 meters in diameter, and placed in this humongous void, it was in fact unbelievably small.

Theoretically speaking, Ling Han shouldn’t have been able to see such a tiny orb of light from billions upon billions of kilometers away, regardless of whether his vision was at the Seventh Tier. However, the distance between them had been far greater than billions of kilometers, yet Ling Han had still managed to see the orb of light with such ease.

Ling Han was astounded. What in the world was this orb of light?

The Genesis World had collapsed, and all of the dimensions had been pancaked, transforming into a layered collection of dimensions. Theoretically speaking, this place should have also been layers upon layers of dimensions.

Unexpectedly, however, it was a vast expanse of emptiness. Only the orb of light hovered there.

Ling Han’s mind was filled with suspicion. Regardless of the environment or the voice that had suddenly appeared in his mind, it was as if an incredible secret was about to be revealed.

He looked at the orb of light in front of him, which would occasionally flash from time to time. It possessed an indescribable rhythm.

‘What the heck is this?’

Theoretically speaking, only Seventh Tier elites would be able to survive the destruction of a Genesis World. Everything else would be destroyed. Now, however, a peculiar orb of light had appeared here. What in the world was going on?

According to the voice in his mind, he was meant to step forward to touch this orb of light.

Ling Han couldn’t help but hesitate. Were there any dangers to this?

One had to realize that he wasn’t a genuine Seventh Tier elite—he didn’t have an indestructible physique. If this orb of light suddenly unleashed an attack at the Seventh Tier or even higher, it was extremely likely that he would be severely wounded or even killed.

‘Should I touch it or not?’

After contemplating this for a moment, Ling Han eventually decided to reach out.

He was far too curious, and he wanted to know what the hell the “mark” inside his body was. He also wanted to learn about the power that had interfered during the destruction of the Genesis World of the last era.

He reached over and placed his hand on the orb of light.

Weng!

Like a pebble falling into a pond, ripples traveled across the surface of the orb of light.

Ling Han didn’t dare to lower his guard. He fully channeled his Powers of Dimension, forming a formidable shield around himself.

Without any warning, a packet of information suddenly burst into his mind.

Boom!

This was a memory that transformed into countless images.

He saw the destruction of the Genesis World of the last era, he saw Chong Yan and the other Seventh Tier elites falling into a slumber, he saw a mysterious power extracting tens of thousands of marks of life and funneling them into the bodies of the five Seventh Tier elites, and he saw this group of dimensions starting to transform and become what it was now.

Afterward, the mysterious orb of light shot a beam of light into Chong Yan. In fact, the images followed this beam of light, which entered Chong Yan’s mind and fused together with a mark of life.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization.

The chosen mark of life was none other than Feng Wuding. This was the origin of the Son of Destiny.

His vision exited Chong Yan’s mind, and what he saw was the world descending into a state of infinite stillness and silence. After countless years, the orb of light bobbled again, shooting out a second beam of light that pierced through the void and entered an all-new world.

This was… the Celestial Realm!

Ling Han was stunned. The Genesis World of the last era actually made contact with the Genesis World of the current era!

‘Gasp! Why the Celestial Realm again?’

His vision followed the beam of light, shooting through the Ancient Realm, and entering a small world. Ling Han felt a strong sense of familiarity.

This was the Lower Realm.

His heart thumped in his chest. This was definitely no coincidence. He had been lured here, and he was now seeing the Lower Realm in the images. There could only be a single explanation—this was all related to him.

Sure enough, the beam of light entered a woman who was just about to give birth. Right after this beam of light entered, another beam of light quickly followed after it.

The mark of Hysteria!

The image suddenly stopped here.

Meanwhile, Ling Han’s mind was filled with a torrent of thoughts.

As it turned out, he was not only chosen by Hysteria, but also chosen by the Genesis World of the last era!

More precisely, the Genesis World of the last era had noticed that he would be chosen by Hysteria, so it had moved even quicker to inject something into his body.

It was because of this that he had been able to break free from Hysteria’s control. Otherwise, regardless of what he had been like before, he would have undergone a significant change after advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. He would have viewed himself as a doppelganger of Hysteria, and he would have remained absolutely unwavering and loyal to Hysteria. He would have viewed death as an opportunity to return to his main body.

In some sense, this would indeed have been the case. After all, the owner of the body would have already died when Hysteria’s will had awakened.

“Chosen One, you… inherited… Need to… exterminate…”

The ancient voice was choppy as it sounded in Ling Han’s mind again. However, too much information was missing, so it was incredibly difficult to make heads or tails of what it was trying to say.
