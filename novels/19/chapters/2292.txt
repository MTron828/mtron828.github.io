Chapter 2293: Truly Strange

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han raised his hands, and said, “We have no evil intentions. We only arrived here by accident.”

An elder walked out from among the people. There was a walking stick in his hand, and he was already fully bald. His white eyebrows hung down on the sides, and it was clear that he had already lived for many years.

His eyes were filled with wisdom, and he asked, “From where have you come? For what reason have you come?”

Ling Han gave a brief summary of their experiences without explicitly hiding anything, If he wanted to win their trust, it was best not to tell any lies. In any case, there was no need for him to lie anyway.

After hearing his story, the members of the tribe all wore astonished expressions.

There was actually a bigger world outside this heaven and earth?

These tribespeople didn’t have any malicious intentions. Since Ling Han had treated them with honesty, they naturally paid him back with honesty. They told him the secrets of this land.

In fact, their story was very simple. They had lived here for generation after generation, and their greatest ambition was simply to stay alive. This was because this land had very scarce resources. If they wanted to survive, they needed to hunt powerful beasts. Alternatively, they could compete for the

herbivores with these carnivorous wild beasts.

Ling Han and the others were quite surprised. After reaching the Second Lotus—which was equivalent to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier of the Celestial Realm—cultivators could survive simply by breathing Spiritual Qi. After reaching the Mountain River Tier, one wouldn’t die even if their Spiritual Qi were

exhausted. They would simply become extremely weak.

However, the people here were all at the Fifth Lotus or Sixth Lotus, yet they still worried about survival? Was this not strange?

“Hang on!”

After hearing the tribespeoples’ explanation, Ling Han and the others also noticed that something was off. Their strength had surprisingly weakened a bit.

“Perhaps we’ve eaten too little?” They had only eaten a single meal these past 10 days, so perhaps this had affected their strength?

This was inconceivable!

“The Spiritual Qi here… is almost exhausted! It’s almost impossible to cultivate!” they exclaimed.

They should have discovered this upon arriving at this place. However, they only realized it now, and it was as if there were some mysterious power affecting their cognitive ability.

“F*ck! Where in the hell is this?” Everyone was slightly scared. If they didn’t eat, they would actually risk death? If they told this to anyone else, they would be laughed off like a clown. Now, however, this was a very real threat.

“Since Spiritual Qi is deficient, how are those Holy Beasts cultivating?” Ling Han asked.

They had reached their cultivation level by eating.

Even though this place had little Spiritual Qi, it did still exist, after all. It was simply that one couldn’t extract this Spiritual Qi through normal methods. Only the plants that grew on the land could absorb this Spiritual Qi. After ingesting these plants, the herbivorous animals would then naturally have a

reserve of Spiritual Qi.

After being hunted and eaten, these herbivorous animals would then provide Spiritual Qi to the cultivators.

Everyone could understand this. However, why would they starve to death if they didn’t eat?

They quickly learned another piece of vital information: everyone in the tribe had a limited lifespan. Currently, the record for the oldest person was 800 years old—they had died from natural causes, and not at the hands of a wild beast.

Only a mere 800 years!

One had to realize that those at the Heaven Tier could already live for 800 years. After reaching the Severing Mundane Tier, one would more so never need to worry about their lifespan anymore. They simply needed to overcome their Immortal’s Tribulation. Here, however, disease and death were all

important matters that people needed to worry about.

‘It’s as if… Immortal’s Tribulation occurs once a year here. Thus, even the strongest person could only hold on for 800 years before being killed,’ Ling Han speculated in his mind. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This wasn’t impossible. After all, there were already cases of people starving to death. That being the case, it wouldn’t be impossible for Immortal’s Tribulation to befall more frequently in this heaven and earth.

Ling Han asked for more information from the tribespeople. However, even though this tribe was always migrating around, they only did so in a small area 500 kilometers in radius. They couldn’t migrate any further. This was because another tribe existed beside them. If they ventured any further, they

might potentially trigger a battle.

Ling Han was extremely interested in their precious tools, so he started to ask about their origins.

“All of our armor comes from the Holy Mountain,” the elder replied. According to him, one simply needed to forge their armor and bring it to the Holy Mountain. After leaving it there for three years, they could retrieve it to use.

This armor could be used to increase either their offensive ability or their defensive ability. However, it would feed on their blood when they used it, and thus each person could only possess one piece of such armor. If they tried to use more, they would naturally die once their blood essence was

exhausted.

These pieces of armor were the most valuable asset of this tribe. This was their key to survival. Second to this was food. In fact, both were almost equally as important. As such, the tribespeople neither gifted Ling Han and the others with armor, nor did they welcome them with food.

Ling Han and the others hadn’t noticed it before, but they discovered that they were incredibly hungry at this moment. It was as if they had truly transformed into ordinary mortals.

“We most likely entered the territory of some powerful elite. This place is run according to their regulations, so we’re also subject to the cycle of life and death. We can also feel hunger and starvation.” Everyone reached the same conclusion.

“However, its effects are so great, and it’s even overriding the ordinary Regulations of heaven and earth. Just how powerful is this person?”

“Heavenly Venerate?” someone asked in a shaky voice.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe immediately shook her head, saying, “Only the Regulations within a small region are being affected, so even Ancestral Kings are capable of this. It’s simply the case that the stronger an Ancestral King, the larger the region that they can affect.”

Celestial Kings stood equal with the Regulations, so it was possible for them to override the Regulations of heaven and earth within a small region.

However, even if this were only a Tenth Lotus Ancestral King, how could Ling Han and the others hope to rival them with their measly power?

“I’s most likely beneath an Ancestral King to engage in such behavior,” Ling Han said. Ancestral Kings couldn’t be so bored and silly. “Perhaps this Ancestral King has already passed away. Or maybe they’ve been severely wounded and trapped in an unconscious state.”

Ling Han wasn’t overly worried. If it truly came to the worst, he could unleash the might of the Black Tower to forcefully break free from this place. However, if he did this, the Black Tower might truly become a crippled tower. It would lose all of its power.

Thus, unless it was absolutely necessary, he definitely wouldn’t use the Black Tower again.

Ling Han wore a faint smile as he retrieved some food from the Black Tower. The tribespeople instantly started to drool upon seeing this. Not only them, but the eyes of Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others also glimmered with greed. After reaching their cultivation level, they would only store Star

Stones and Celestial medicines in their Spatial God Tool. How could they have any food?

“Food for armor. Deal or no deal?” he asked with a smile. “Don’t lie to me. There are definitely new pieces of armor lying around.”

The tribespeople salivated as they stared at the food.

“Esteemed guest, you have to realize that the metals and ores used to forge these pieces of armor are extremely difficult to mine,” an elder of the tribe said. He was clearly trying to bargain.

Ling Han wasn’t afraid of them asking for a higher price—as long as they were willing to trade. Thus, he smiled, and said, “I can add some more food. However, the more important thing is, how many items do you have to exchange?”

The elder smiled, and even the wrinkles on his face smoothed out a little.

After bargaining for a while, Ling Han used a large amount of food to trade for a set of armor. He could armor himself from head to toe. However, he was told by the tribespeople that even if someone were incredibly strong, they could at most only wear two pieces of armor at once. Otherwise, they would

be seeking death.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. He then traded for one more wrist guard, and tossed it to Yong Qin. This was to compensate him for his loss.

After that, he started to immediately investigate these pieces of armor..
