Chapter 2010: Profit from a disaster

Ling Han cursed internally, and hurriedly ducked back into the Black Tower.

“Urgh!” he groaned lowly. He had indeed entered into the Black Tower, but he had still been swept a little by the Celestial King Tier aura, causing at least 90% of the bones in his body to break, and they were all shattered at that.

Too terrifying. The attack of the Celestial King had not hit him at all, but merely being swept by the aura had caused the physique that Ling Han had been so proud of to fully crumble.

This was what a Celestial King was!

The pinnacle of all. Every casual movement represented the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

“Ling Han!” The Empress and the others hurriedly gathered around him.

Ling Han exhaled heavily, and said through clenched teeth, “I’m fine. I won’t die from this.”

“You still say that you’re fine, but even your d*ck is destroyed.” Hu Niu’s expression was filled with grief. “Wuuu. Stupid Ling Han, you haven’t had babies with Niu yet!”

‘F***, where are your eyes looking!’

Ling Han hurriedly channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid. Usually, when this drop of Indestructible True Fluid was channeled, his injuries should immediately recover in a very short amount of time, yet they did not do so now.

Though he had just been slightly grazed by a Celestial King’s aura, the martial intent of a Celestial King was still contained within. If it was not erased, even the Indestructible True Fluid could do nothing.

After all, there was too large a disparity in the level of both sides.

“What kind of Celestial King is this, to actually ambush a few Dividing Soul Tiers!” Ling Han ridiculed.

It could only be said that a Celestial King’s patience was really too good. Who knew how many epochs he had been alive for. To him, waiting 100 years, 1,000 years, or even 1,000,000 years was nothing. It could not be said to pass in a snap of the fingers, but it was still no big deal.

In comparison, the patience of Ling Han and his party was too poor.

“I will heal my injuries first.” Ling Han sat down at one side, and stimulated the power of the Black Tower, trying to erase the willpower of the Celestial King.

This was too difficult. What was a Celestial King? That was an existence that stood at the pinnacle of great dao. Even if Ling Han possessed the Black Tower, erasing the willpower of a Celestial King was still as difficult as ascending the heavens.

He endlessly fought with this streak of Celestial King Tier willpower, commencing a tug-of-war inside his body, and making progress only with great difficulty.

If this had not been inside the Black Tower, and if it had not been for the fact that he cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, which overwhelmed Celestial King Tier in terms of level, there would’ve been absolutely no possible way that he could expel the Celestial King Tier willpower. He would only be slowly obliterated by the latter.

If it was not so overbearing, how could a Celestial King be qualified to be called as a Celestial King, and stand at the pinnacle of Dao?

Ling Han forgot all else, and concentrated on resisting the Celestial King Tier willpower.

One year, two years, 10 years, 100 years. Time passed quickly, and 100,000 years had passed inside the Black Tower, and Ling Han had finally gotten the upper hand.

He had not achieved victory in this war, but merely gotten the upper hand.

He finally knew how he should deal with this Celestial King Tier willpower, and what made him even more pleasantly surprised was that through this kind of tug-of-war, his application of Regulations had become even more meticulous and proficient.

He had a feeling that his present battle prowess was definitely much stronger than it had been 100 years ago[1].

Firstly, it was because his cultivation level had increased, and secondly, his grasp of Regulations had reached a meticulous and detailed extent.

Only in that manner would he be able to clearly understand the profound mysteries of the Celestial King Tier willpower, and be able to expel it.

Of course, this was only a streak of aura from a Celestial King. If he had really been struck, then no matter how detailed his grasp of Regulations was, it would’ve been completely ineffective.

Ling Han continued to resist this streak of willpower, and time passed swiftly. 100 years, 200 years, 500 years, and Ling Han finally opened his eyes once more. A whole 500,000 years had passed within the Black Tower.

The Celestial King Tier willpower had finally dispersed completely.

It really was troublesome. A whole 600 years, and the time inside the Black Tower was 600,000 years even, and only then did he manage to expel a streak of martial intent.

“Ling Han, are you fine now?” Hu Niu and the other women all approached.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I’m fine now, and... I can be considered to have profited from this disaster.”

His cultivation level had already reached late-stage Yang Soul. This was a genuine improvement, and the improvement that could not be seen was his practical use of Regulations.

The present he was a little like Ji Wuming. He clearly was at the same cultivation level as his peers, yet could drive others to despair.

“Don’t know if that detestable guy has left or not,” Hu Niu said with a pout.

“He might not have left, but we have encountered a considerable number of huge waves in these several centuries, so we should have left that area far behind. Even the divine sense of a Celestial King can only cover a limited area.”

“We should have exited that area.”

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, preparing himself to flee immediately, but after waiting for half a day, the sea was still completely tranquil, and no one made a move to attack him.

Weng!

A large ship suddenly appeared in the distance, rapidly heading in his direction. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han looked closely, and saw that there was a flag raised on the large ship. The flag held a falcon that fluttered in the wind, and looked very lifelike.

This was a... merchant ship!

The boundless sea was not a dead area. Instead, there would be frequent merchant ships traveling to and fro. Though it was very dangerous, the profit was also extremely high.

In the boundless seas, there were basically no rumors about pirates appearing. The danger mostly came from ******* itself. There were too many powerful living creatures here, and some of them could even make Celestial Kings frown.

Thus, those traveling merchants that dared to do business on the boundless seas had to have elites acting as their protective escort.

“Young man, come on board!” When the large ship passed him, it did not stop. Instead, a rope was thrown over, and just stopped a foot away in front of Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a hand to grab it, and pulled strongly. Then, his whole person flew forwards, and he landed steadily on the deck.

“Was your merchant ship attacked by a Sea King Class?” There was a large man standing on the deck, and the other end of the rope was grasped in his hand.

In the boundless seas, those powerful Immortal Beasts that had reached Celestial King Tier would be called Sea King Class.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then replied, “More or less.”

Two Celestial Kings could also be considered Sea King Class, right?

...If the Ink Poison King and the Seven Clouds King knew, they would definitely be fuming with rage. He had actually compared them to vicious beasts of the sea that lacked intelligence. Wasn’t that mocking them?

“We are going to the Western Celestial Realm. If you are heading that way too, then we’ll allow you to hitch a ride. However, there is no free lunch in this world. You would have to power the formation every day, and this will be considered your travel fee,” the large man said.

“All right!” Ling Han agreed.

The large man arranged a room for him, and Ling Han would go to the bottom of the large ship, powering the formation every day with the other sailors, and exerting a driving force for the ship.

After several days, Ling Han had also gotten familiar with all the sailors.

This merchant ship belonged to the Qin Clan, and the Qin Clan was an Ascending Origin Tier-level force. The Qin Clan had a total of 11 large-scale merchant ships, and every merchant ship would have an Ascending Origin Tier great elite standing guard. As long as they did not encounter any Sea King Class, they basically wouldn’t get into any form of trouble.

The large man that had previously allowed Ling Han onboard was named Qin Wei, and he was an Immortal Palace Tier elite. He had a candid character, and was fond of making friends. If that had not been the case, he would not have meddled in other people’s business, and given Ling Han a hand.

On this day, Ling Han was presently resting inside the ship. The conditions here were very poor, so he did not release the four women, Shi Yu, and Shi Lei.

With a boom, the ship shuddered violently.

What was it? Had they been attacked again?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The ship shook repeatedly, and the strength of the tremors was gradually increasing.

“Oh no, we’ve encountered a giant tsunami wave!” someone gasped.
