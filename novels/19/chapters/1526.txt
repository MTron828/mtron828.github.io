Chapter 1527 You Dare to Screw With Me?

100,000 True Origin Stones?

Eternal River Tier elites could easily earn this amount if they opened their mouth. After all, Eternal River Tier cultivators could be regarded as elites no matter where they went.

However, what did this matter? They were worth nothing in Shi Gangyang’s eyes.

‘I’m openly screwing with you, but what can you do?’

Shi Gangyang crossed his arms before his chest, a smug look on his face.

Ling Han had only just advanced to the Eternal River Tier, and he was more so as foolish and naive as a child. He had actually given Lin Yuqi all of his Godly metal in one go! If he didn’t cheat him, whom else would he cheat?

“Why aren’t you picking it up? Are you unhappy with the amount?” Shi Gangyang continued to humiliate Ling Han, saying, “I’m already being incredibly generous by giving you this amount. Otherwise, you might not even receive a single True Origin Stone! Hurry up, take it and p*ss off!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “It’s been a long time since I’ve felt such a strong urge to beat someone. Congratulations, you’ve fuelled my urge to become violent again!”

“Hah, you want to get physical?” Shi Gangyang shook his head upon hearing this. Young people were truly too reckless. Weren’t they aware of their own limitations? Fighting against him? That would simply be seeking humiliation. In any case, he could teach this brat a lesson in life.

In fact, he was actually a little jealous of Ling Han. He had only reached the Eternal River Tier after cultivating for tens of millions of years, yet Ling Han? He was brimming with vitality, and he was much like a scathing furnace. It was clear that he was extremely young.

Ling Han’s lifespan would be hundreds of millions of years longer than his! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han waved his fists, and said, “You’re not worthy of becoming my opponent. I’m simply going to pummel you!”

“You’re but a measly cultivator at the low extreme— Aaaah!” Shi Gangyang was still expressing his disdain, yet Ling Han had already charged forward and struck out with his hand. Heavenly bodies appeared, and there was an expanse of dazzling light within his silver river. Although there were only 80 or so heavenly bodies, each of them was hundreds of times larger than ordinary heavenly bodies.

Shi Gangyang instantly felt a formidable pressure bearing down upon him. A burst of wind swept over, causing waves of pain to ripple across his skin.

‘This is a powerful enemy! I can’t underestimate him!’

He roared loudly before also unleashing his silver river. There were at least 700 heavenly bodies within this silver river, and this signified that he had already reached the late stage of the medium extreme. He had an advantage of four stars over Ling Han.

“You’re seeking death!” he roared. He immediately counterattacked, spreading his hand and grabbing at Ling Han’s throat. He was going to defeat Ling Han in the most humiliating way possible. He was going to leave Ling Han with a painful and unforgettable memory.

Boom!

Ling Han’s hand arrived and easily obliterated Shi Gangyang’s attack. Right now, he could even challenge elites at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Thus, how could someone at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier rival him?

“What?!” Shi Gangyang cried in astonishment. He almost wet himself in fright.

‘He’s only at the low extreme, so how can he be this powerful?’

Ling Han tightened his grip—his hand already wrapped around Shi Gangyang’s neck. Shi Gangyang’s body instantly became limp under the power of his Origin Power. He couldn’t move even a single finger.

He was genuinely transfixed with terror. All he could do was stare at Ling Han in shock and disbelief. In fact, his eyes were almost about to pop out of their sockets.

“Open your mouth!” Ling Han ordered coldly.

Shi Gangyang shook his head with great difficulty. At the same time, he kept his mouth tightly shut. It was clear that Ling Han wasn’t going to do anything good.

Ling Han made a grabbing motion and retrieved the spatial ring from the ground. He then used his divine sense to activate it, instantly retrieving the mountain of True Origin Stones that was contained within it. He grabbed a piece and forced it into Shi Gangyang’s mouth.

“W-what are you doing?!” Shi Gangyang shouted using his divine sense. He was both astonished and terrified.

“Open your mouth!” Ling Han mercilessly slapped him, causing him to open his mouth. He then immediately stuffed the True Origin Stone inside. This True Origin Stone was so large that it caused Shi Gangyang’s mouth to distort.

Meanwhile, Ling Han grabbed another True Origin Stone and forcefully stuffed it inside his mouth. Shi Gangyang couldn’t help but tremble, and his eyes were almost about to pop out.

This was far too painful.

He was at the Eternal River Tier, so he could easily obliterate even the toughest True Origin Stones if he attacked them with his full power. However, he didn’t possess a powerful physique, and his Origin Power was more so being restricted at this moment. Failing to form a protective barrier, how could his physique rival the toughness of True Origin Stones?

His throat was immediately wounded after being forced to swallow two True Origin Stones. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and he felt an overwhelming pain shoot through his body.

However, Ling Han was merciless as he forced a third True Origin Stone into his mouth.

Even though his cultivation had been suppressed, an Eternal River Tier elite was still an Eternal River Tier elite. How could he be killed so easily?

“You’re taking things too far! The Shi Clan... No, the entire Treasure Forest Pavilion won’t forgive you!” Shi Gangyang was still talking tough with his divine sense.

“Huh? You’re more stubborn than I imagined,” Ling Han said with a chuckle. He grabbed another True Origin Stone and stuffed it into Shi Gangyang’s mouth. “Weren’t you acting all arrogant and haughty just then? Didn’t you want to dismiss me with a mere 100,000 True Origin Stones?

“Heh, a cultivator can be killed but not humiliated! You wanted to use these 100,000 True Origin Stones to dismiss me? Well, now I’m returning them all! Let’s see how much you can stomach!”

Shi Gangyang instantly went as white as a sheet.

Would his stomach explode if he swallowed all of these True Origin Stones?

Most likely not. Even though he didn’t possess a powerful physique, the bodies of Eternal River Tier elites were still incredibly powerful. Thus, it would be extremely difficult to force it to the point of explosion. However, True Origin Stones were also incredibly tough. These weren’t things that his body could easily digest. Thus, his belly would clearly reflect how many True Origin Stones he had swallowed.

The image of his other body parts remaining normal while his belly became as large as a small mountain flashed across Shi Gangyang’s mind. He couldn’t help but shudder at the thought of this.

He truly couldn’t comprehend what was happening right now. He was an entire minor level above Ling Han, and thus they should have at least been evenly matched, even if Ling Han was a four-star genius. So, how had he been suppressed so easily?

“Mmmph!” He shook his head as Ling Han forced another True Origin Stone into his mouth. His belly visibly grew larger again.

Ling Han smiled faintly. However, in Shi Gangyang’s eyes, he was nothing short of a devil.

“Aren’t you afraid of the Treasure Forest Pavilion taking revenge?” Shi Gangyang asked in anger.

Pa!

Ling Han ruthlessly slapped him again. “Have you become stupid after eating too many stones? Would I be doing this if I were afraid? Sure enough, as someone who dared to cheat me, there’s something wrong with your brain.”

Shi Gangyang genuinely wanted to cry. How had he provoked such a ruthless person? Not only was he unfathomably powerful, but he was also a fearless person who didn’t give a toss about his background. He wasn’t giving face to even the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

“I’ll return your belongings to you!” he hurriedly shouted. He was afraid that Ling Han might eventually kill him.

“There’s no hurry,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. “In any case, you can’t escape from me, so why don’t we enjoy ourselves for a little longer.”

‘Enjoy your mom!’ Shi Gangyang roared in his mind.

He couldn’t endure this for much longer.

Ling Han glared at him, and said, “Did you curse me in your mind?”

“Mmmph!” Shi Gangyang hurriedly shook his head. However, another True Origin Stone was stuffed in his mouth at this moment, and the pain that it caused made him flail about wildly.

Ling Han wore an earnest expression as he said, “One should be honest and upright. Cursing someone in your mind isn’t a good habit.”

Shi Gangyang felt an urge to curse him again. ‘I simply cursed you in my mind, yet you’re already torturing me to such an extent. What would happen if I cursed you aloud?’ However, he only dared to think this in his mind. He didn’t dare to say it out aloud.

“Are they tasty? You can have more if they’re tasty. There’s no hurry. After all, there’s no one fighting over them with you.” Ling Han forced True Origin Stone after True Origin Stone into his mouth. Heh, this was the price for daring to steal his belongings.

Shi Gangyang felt like he was about to die. However, how could mere physical pain cause an Eternal River Tier elite to lose their consciousness? Tears started to stream down his face, and he said, “I’ll give you whatever you want! Just let me go!”

“Nonsense! Those Godly metals were originally mine anyway. Stop pretending to be generous.” Ling Han continued to stuff True Origin Stones into his mouth. Shi Gangyang had used these 100,000 True Origin Stones to humiliate him, so he would naturally return the favor using the exact same True Origin Stones.

Shi Gangyang sobbed even louder. If he had known this earlier, he would have only given Ling Han one True Origin Stone!
