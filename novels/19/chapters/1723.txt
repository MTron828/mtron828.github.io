Chapter 1724: Leaving Dark Moon City

Ding Yaolong was completely unaware that if he resolutely attacked, Ling Han wouldn’t be able to withstand his power anymore.

Although Ling Han had blocked an attack from Ding Yaolong just then, that had already exhausted all of his Origin Power. As such, he wouldn’t be able to block a second attack. However, Ding Yaolong thought that Ling Han’s defenses had already reached a stage where even Severing Mundane Tier grand elders couldn’t wound him anymore. Thus, he directly unleashed the power of Regulations to refine Ling Han.

“Soaring Light Flashing Shadow Spatial Escape Divine Technique!” Ling Han shouted randomly.

Xiu!

He directly entered the Black Tower.

Fourth severance grand elders were far too powerful, and using the power of Regulations, they possessed the ability to refine him in just a moment’s time.

Ling Han suddenly vanished into thin air.

Ding Yaolong’s expression was extremely dark. He was refining Ling Han, so even if Ling Han performed spatial teleportation, such a technique should have been restricted by his power—unless Ling Han was more powerful than him. However, if Ling Han were more powerful than him, would he need to flee?

‘How did he suddenly vanish?’

With the situation just then, even Spatial God Tools should have instantly exploded if they were used. Thus, Ling Han’s disappearance was a complete mystery.

‘Where is he?’

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Han Lu, as well as the fourth severance grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan, all leaped forward. There was interest and curiosity on their faces. How had Ling Han vanished into thin air in such a situation?

“Did he truly teleport away?” the four elites said in speculation. This was also the most reasonable speculation.

“I can’t detect that junior’s aura in Dark Moon City,” Han Lu said coldly. He turned his ice-cold gaze toward the large black dog. He couldn’t forget the hatred of being bitten in the bum.

However, Ling Han was far too important. Not only had he “killed” a junior of the Han Clan, but he was even involved in matters regarding Celestial King Tier secret techniques!

Gasp!

He suddenly thought of a possibility.

Perhaps Ling Han was a successor of a Celestial King Tier force? Thus, he was able to use all kinds of mysterious techniques? Moreover, unless he belonged to a top-notch force, how could he possess such temperament and manipulation abilities?

Han Lu started to feel a little apprehensive. After all, not only was Ling Han strange, but the large black dog was also extremely strange. He looked like a Genesis Tier cultivator, yet he possessed supreme abilities that even Severing Mundane Tier grand elders couldn’t rival.

If Ling Han were the descendent of a Celestial King, then everything would make perfect sense.

The more Han Lu pondered over this, the more uneasy he felt. After a brief moment, he directly grabbed Han Qi and left the Ding Clan. He definitely had to report today’s events to the grand elders of the clan so that they could make a decision on this matter. His status was far too low to decide anything himself.

Ding Yaolong didn’t stop him. After all, what could he do even if he stopped Han Lu? Could he force him to compensate for the loss of the Ding Clan?

Ding Hu was still screaming in agony, yet his aura was already becoming weaker and weaker. Once the Nine Heavens Flame combusted one’s soul, it wouldn’t extinguish until the burning soul was annihilated.

A powerful Severing Mundane Tier grand elder was actually going to die at the hands of a measly Genesis Tier cultivator! This was most likely an unprecedented feat in the Celestial Realm, and a feat that would nail Ding Hu’s name onto the pillar of humiliation for all eternity. In the future, he would most likely be used as an example of what not to do. During some year, some month, and some day, Ding Hu, a first severance grand elder, was killed by a Genesis Tier cultivator.

“Grand... Elder...” Ding Hu spoke his final words.

Boom!

His soul was burned into ashes, and even his body was completely disintegrated by the Nine Heavens Flame. Not a single trace of his existence remained in the world.

Ding Yaolong clenched his fists, and it was as if flames were about to erupt from his eyes.

“Grand Elder?” Ding Song and Ding Shan asked carefully.

“Deploy everyone to look for him... If anyone finds him, kill him without mercy!” Ding Yaolong said solemnly.

“Understood!”

The Ding Clan was wild with rage. In just a short day, their ancestral shrine had been destroyed, and a first severance grand elder had also been killed. This was an unfathomable loss.

While the elites of the Ding Clan were busy searching for him, Ling Han seized the opportunity to calmly exit the black tower. He came across a few members of the Ding Clan on his way, yet they were all disposed of by him in a single strike. Was there anyone under the Severing Mundane Tier who could rival him?

After leaving the Ding Clan, he entered the Black Tower again, completely concealing his aura. When the elites of the Ding Clan arrived, they naturally couldn’t find any traces of him.

After repeating this a few times, Ling Han went to the army encampment to seek an audience with Mao Dai.

He needed Mao Dai to help him leave Dark Moon City. The Ding Clan would definitely guard the exits of the city, so leaving would naturally be extremely difficult. However, if Mao Dai was willing to help, then who apart from Ding Yaolong could stop him?

Upon seeing Ling Han, Mao Dai shook his head, and exclaimed, “You’re... truly a freak!” His face was full of astonishment.

Truth be told, even he didn’t possess the ability to flee so easily after toying around with two fourth severance great elders.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Senior is flattering me.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Do you want to hide here for a while?” Mao Dai asked with a smile. Although he was only at the third severance, he wasn’t afraid of the three great clans. This was because he already had some acquaintances in the Fu Clan. Once he advanced to the fourth severance, he would immediately leave this place and seek a path to become stronger.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “Please help me leave this city, Senior.”

Mao Dai faltered for a moment before asking in astonishment, “You want to go to the Severing Mundane Pool?”

“That’s right,” Ling Han said with a nod.

Mao Dai looked at Ling Han as if he were a freak. He had only just advanced to the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, yet he was already thinking about advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier? His voice was extremely solemn as he said, “You need to consider this carefully. Severing the mundane isn’t that easy, and if you’re not careful, you might even sever your own life!”

Which Genesis Tier cultivator didn’t need to spend hundreds of millions of years or even billions of years to prepare? Only then would they dare to sever the mundane. Even as a supreme talent himself, Mao Dai had still prepared for seven million or so years before advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier.

Moreover, when had he advanced to the consummate level of the Genesis Tier? When he was 30,000 years old!

He admitted that Ling Han was indeed more talented than him. However, regardless of how talented he was, could he prepare in one year what he had prepared in seven million years?

Mao Dai genuinely didn’t believe this.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Rest assured, Senior, I naturally know my limits.”

‘Do you truly know your limits?’

Mao Dai pondered for a moment, but he ultimately didn’t try to persuade Ling Han anymore. This was because Ling Han’s actions just then had been far too astounding. Who could have thought that a Genesis Tier cultivator would be able to withstand the fury of a fourth severance grand elder?

Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising even if Ling Han performed more miracles.

“Alright, I’ll help you leave the city.”

Mao Dai didn’t speak any nonsense, and he immediately started to help Ling Han leave the city.

Mao Dai prepared a chariot, and Ling Han simply sat inside as they casually navigated toward the city gates.

The chariot was extremely quick, and they arrived at the city gates in no time, where they were stopped by the city guards.

“Brother Mao!” Ding Shan clasped his hands in greeting, and said, “Why are you suddenly leaving the city?”

“Do I need your permission to leave the city?” Mao Dai asked coldly. He didn’t give Ding Shan any face.

Ding Shan’s expression involuntarily darkened, yet he knew that Mao Dai wasn’t someone he could easily provoke. Thus, he forcefully suppressed his anger, and said, “Brother Mao, please open the chariot door and your Spatial God Tool for me to inspect!”

“What if I say no?” Mao Dai asked calmly.

“Please cooperate with us, Brother Mao!” Ding Shan said solemnly. He understood that Mao Dai valued Ling Han highly, so he definitely couldn’t allow Mao Dai to leave the city just like that.

If he helped Ling Han escape, then the Ding Clan would truly have no idea where to pursue him.

Mao Dai pondered for a moment before suddenly stepping aside, and saying, “Fine!”
