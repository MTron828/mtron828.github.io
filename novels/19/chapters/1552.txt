Chapter 1553 Gou Li“s regard

Mo Li, this person with a wooden face, was actually female!She did not have the slightest bit of femininity!

However, on the other hand, she did not have any bit of masculinity, either. If she said she was male, Ling Han would definitely think that she was lacking manliness, and was too effeminate.

“No way!” Wu Jue jumped up, pointed at Ling Han, and exclaimed, “How could you possibly be this strong? Previously, you had only just broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier, so how could you have become this strong in just over 100 years!”

Ling Han was shocked. “You saw me over 100 years ago? Why don’t I have the slightest recollection of you?”

Wu Jue humphed, yet was unwilling to speak of the situation at the time.

Ling Han thought for a moment. That should have been on Cloud Apex Planet because Joint Peace Planet did not have the Two Realm Battlefield. Otherwise, if he had met a being of the Netherworld at some other place, he would definitely have a very deep impression of it.

However, there were too many beings of the Netherworld at the Two Realm Battlefield, so how could he possibly remember whom he had met before?

Forget it, he had even killed a Saint already, so what need was there for him to be at such a loss about the son of a Demon Master?

With this thought, Ling Han also let the matter go, and no longer continued to think of where he had once met Wu Jue.

Furthermore, though Wu Jue had a big beef with him, it was obviously not the kind of overflowing hatred that wanted him to be dead. Otherwise, he only had to expose the fact that Ling Han was a cultivator from the Immortal Realm—the words of the son of a Demon Master naturally had weight—and that would definitely bring massive trouble for Ling Han.

The two Demon Masters fought fiercely. This was the battle of the strongest of the Netherworld and Immortal Realms, and it continued until the skies darkened. Though Mo Li already possessed the power of the Genesis Tier, her battle prowess was far from that level, and she could not be mentioned on equal terms with them at all.

This battle did not continue for too long. After merely 10 days, the two Demon Masters stopped.

It was another tie.

However, the Overlord Sword Demon Master had lost his wager. He had betted on winning this battle.

Zhu Xuan left in a rush. She wanted to find her old man. Just fight if you wanted, but why was it that she became the stake in a bet between the two of them? If he was so intent on marriage... then he could go ahead and get married himself!

Ling Han also planned to slip away quietly. He had gained a lot this time, and planned to enter into seclusion as soon as he returned. Firstly, he had to directly upgrade the Divine Demon Sword to Saint Tier, and secondly, he had to comprehend the Regulations of the Netherworld so that his grasp would catch up with his cultivation level.

Then, he would once again merge the Regulations of the two Realms, and his battle prowess would increase to another level.

Though using himself as a formation would allow him to have battle prowess that far exceeded his cultivation level, this was not a path that he wished to take. The path that he was determined to walk on was to strengthen himself.

“Hey, hey, hey, don’t go!” Yet Wu Jue hailed him down. He was obviously not all that interested in his betrothed, and did not stop Zhu Xuan from leaving at all. However, he had great interest in Ling Han.

“What is it?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“I want to get revenge!” Wu Jue raised his head high, appearing to be very infuriated.

“Just what exactly did I do to you?” Ling Han was speechless. Had he really bullied this little boy before?

“You come with me, and when my abilities catch up to you, I will personally defeat you!” Wu Jue exclaimed very foolishly and naively.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and pressed a hand on his head. “Young man, you have to be down-to-earth in life. Don’t think of unrealistic things.”

Wu Jue shouted in anger; just how much were you looking down on me? Waving both his arms, he wanted to hit Ling Han, but with Ling Han pressing down on his head, this was completely wasted effort. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t touch Ling Han at all.

“Mo Li, tell me, will I be able to defeat him in future?” He asked for Mo Li’s help.

Mo Li thought the matter over seriously, and answered, “Impossible!”

Wu Jue was stunned, and then felt so aggrieved he almost broke into tears. ‘Are you really on my side? Why are you siding with an outsider?’ Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“This is the truth,” Mo Li emphasized again. That was what her personality was like.

Wu Jue was struck speechless. Only after a while did he say, “I don’t believe it; I definitely want to defeat this guy! Ling Han, do you dare to come with me?” He was spurring him on.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then replied, “Fine.”

Firstly, he did not have any kind of goal in the Netherworld, and secondly, Mo Li was a very good opponent, and could be used to temper him.

“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!” Wu Jue immediately became excited again.

“Filth King Ling, let’s meet again in future!” Gou Li said, a strange grin on his face.

Ling Han involuntarily shivered. A savage man that was seven feet tall actually wore that kind of smile; there was definitely something off!

Gou Li waved his hand and marched off.

He arrived at a spot where there was no one else, and drew out a conch-like item. It was made of jade and was very beautifully crafted, but he had not taken it out to play with it. Instead, he inserted his Origin Power into it with a very serious expression, and suddenly, multiple formation patterns glowed.

“En.” A voice was actually heard from the conch[1].

“Greetings, Ninth Elder!” Gou Li called out respectfully first, and then said, “I have found a very impressive sapling.”

“How impressive?” the other questioned.

“If I have not seen wrongly, this person is already able to merge the Regulations of the two Realms,” Gou Li answered solemnly.

“What!” The other was stunned. “Which Demon Master is it?”

“In reply to Ninth Elder, it is not a Demon Master, but rather an Eternal River Tier,” Gou Li replied.

There was suddenly no reply from the other side. Only after a long while did the other side ask, “Are you sure that he has really merged the Regulations of the two Realms?”

“I am 90% sure.” Gou Li did not confirm it completely.

“If that is the case, then I will personally come. Such a sapling can be of use for our alliance!” the other side said. “Keep your eye on that person, and you must definitely not lose track of him.”

“Understood.”

***

However, Wu Jue was not in a rush to return. It was his first time visiting Cold Clouds Planet, so he wanted to travel around. Ling Han thus made a deal with him. They would meet at the foot of the Black Jade Mountains, and then set off together to Sea Space Planet. That was the planet where the Hysteria Demon Master resided.

Taking this opening, Ling Han finally managed to enter into the Black Tower, and upgrade the Divine Demon Sword.

After swallowing the final few pieces of Level 13 Godly metal, the Divine Demon Sword experienced a qualitative change and broke through to Level 14. And he did not just stop there. Ling Han had a great amount of Level 14 Godly metal in his possession, and easily sent the Divine Demon Sword up to Level 15, and then on to Level 16.

When it had swallowed enough Level 16 Godly metal, indescribable divine patterns drifted on this Divine Sword. They definitely had been inscribed on the sword by Ling Han.

This was Saintly patterns!

‘Theoretically, the Divine Demon Sword is a Celestial Tool, so what should be drifting on it should be celestial patterns. Then, these perhaps may not be the inscribed patterns of the Divine Demon Sword itself, but rather something that appeared due to it having swallowed innumerable God Tool, thus forming Saintly patterns,’ Ling Han surmised.

Presently, the Divine Demon Sword was also undergoing an intense transformation, entering into Saing Tier. This breach was too wide. Even if it was the Divine Demon Sword, it seemed like it had to undergo a very long process.

He observed closely; perhaps this would be beneficial for him.

However, he really could not understand.

A Saint level item could not be comprehended at all if his cultivation level was inadequate.

Ling Han watched for a while, and then gave up. He’d just have to wait and see when he reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. As for now? There was no point in biting off more than he could chew. He should first ensure that his grasp of the Regulations of the Netherworld caught up.

He arrived at the roots of the Reincarnation Tree. The Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden just happened to have completed their cultivation, and listened to him relate what had previously happened. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was extremely intrigued regarding Mo Li, and wanted to see how hard it was to distinguish her gender.

Just in time, and Ling Han explained about how the Regulations of the Netherworld and Immortal Realm could be merged to the two women. If they wanted to enter into the Celestial Realm, this was a step that they probably had to take.
