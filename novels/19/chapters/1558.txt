1559 Inconceivably strong

The elderly Demon Master looked at the Hysteria Demon Master, swept his eyes over the other Demon Masters, and only then did he say, “You all have an objection too?”

The Overlord Sword Demon Master took a step forward, and declared, “Outsiders are not welcome here!”

“Hoho!” The elderly Demon Master chuckled, and said, “If you all have the ability to chase me off, I naturally will leave. Otherwise, just shut your mouths!”

All the Demon Masters glared at the old man, their eyes leaking a menacing coldness.

As an outsider, you actually dared to be so arrogant?

“Come and battle me!” the old man declared menacingly, acting extremely proud.

The five young people he brought also crossed their arms over their chests. Looking at the arrogant expressions on their faces, they did not seem to take anyone seriously, not even these Demon Masters. This was a superiority that radiated from their very bones.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head—this kind of demeanor seemed very familiar.

The Overlord Sword Demon Master did not say another word, and waved out a hand. A flash of sword light sliced towards the old man. This flash of sword light was only about a foot long, and looked very ordinary.

But how could the attack of a Demon Master be anything ordinary?

The old man smiled faintly, and pressed his hand down. He had gripped that flash of sword light in his hand, and with a squeeze, the sword light was forcibly obliterated, and did not give rise to any waves at all.

Seeing this scene, all the Demon Masters showed an expression of shock.

The Overlord Sword Demon Master obviously had not used his full strength, but he belonged to the top grade category among Yellow Demons. Even a casual attack possessed astonishing might, yet it was dispersed in such a relaxed manner. The old man’s abilities were unfathomably deep. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If they started a life-and-death battle with this kind of elite, even if the seven of them combined forces, it was possible that he could kill one or two of them in the process.

Who would be willing to die when they had reached the height of Demon Master?

The old man had used his abilities to prove that he indeed had the right to be standing here.

“Hoho, for people of our level, resorting to violence is too much below our status. Why don’t we allow our juniors to exchange a few moves?” a female Demon Master spoke up. She was an old woman, and her hand held a crimson red walking stick. She looked like a doddering old woman.

But this walking stick was a Saint Tool, and possessed astonishing might.

When the other Demon Masters heard this, they all nodded.

Among these disciples and juniors of theirs, there were a few incredibly impressive existences, such as Mo Li and Zhu Ba. Allowing them to confront each other in battle would both allow the battle to be carried out in a controllable manner, and also allow these outsiders to retreat willingly.

The old man looked indifferent, and only showed a profound smile. He naturally knew clearly the line of thought of these Demon Masters. He turned around, and said, “Mo’er, go and seek some guidance from these people.”

“Yes, Sixth Elder.” A young man walked out. He was very handsome, and had very fair skin, but there was a vague golden luster in his complexion. He swept an eye over the many young people gathered here with a smile, and said, “I am Tan Mo. Who would be sparring with me?”

The Overlord Sword Demon Master and the other elites paused slightly, and then spoke up. “Mo Li, Sword Dao, Yun He, it will be the three of you.”

“Send three of yours out as well,” the Hysteria Demon Master said to the old man.

The old man merely smiled, and replied, “No need, one person is enough!”

You wanted to have a one-versus-three battle?

It should be known that Mo Li, Zhu Ba, and Yun He were all the strongest elites of the Eternal River Tier, and all of them had formed more than 1,000,000 stars. If it were not for the fact that the Regulations of Genesis Tier were too difficult to comprehend, they would have become Demon Masters long ago.

“I’ll go first!” Zhu Ba said. He also had his own pride, and naturally would not be willing to combine forces with others.

Tan Mo was indifferent, and said, “Make your move.” He acted very calm, like he was giving some guidance to a lackey.

Fury rose up in Zhu Ba’s heart. He took a step forward, and shot out a punch from afar.

There were a great many Demon Masters present, so there was absolutely no need for him to be reserved. He used his full abilities in his first move, and had no need to worry that the aftermath and shock waves would cause too much destruction.

Tan Mo pressed a palm down lightly, and a silvery river suddenly appeared, multiple stars shattering within, presenting a terrifying scene. This was not as ordinary as merely a frightening scene; its might was even more terrifying. It gave rise to waves that could destroy the world, and they blasted out towards Zhu Ba.

Zhu Ba dared not take this attack head-on, and hurriedly leaped up, avoiding this blow.

Even the Demon Masters were stunned. How could this guy’s power be so strong? Just how many stars had he formed?

Though an Eternal River Tier could form innumerable stars theoretically, this was merely theory. In truth, once one had formed more than 1,000,000 stars, because he had not unlocked the upper limit of his cultivation level, forming every additional star was extraordinarily difficult, and it would become more and more difficult as time went on.

Even for those as strong as Mo Li and the others, they had only formed around 1,100,000 stars. This was a publicly acknowledged upper limit. No matter how freakishly talented you were, you would only attain this point and no further.

Then, how could Tan Mo have such overwhelming power?

Tan Mo took the initiative to attack. He merely struck out with palm strikes, and did not use any kind of secret technique, but because his power was really too strong, it had reached a completely overwhelming point. What need was there for him to use any kind of secret technique?

Everyone paled. Zhu Ba was the synonym for the strongest of the Eternal River Tier in their hearts, but now he was evading like he was a duck that was being chased to and fro. He did not even have the ability to fight back, which stunned all of them.

“You all come at me too!” Tan Mo pressed down a palm again, and pulled both Mo Li and Yun He into the battle.

Three great big shots of the Eternal River Tier joined forces, but it was useless. Tan Mo was like the heavenly emperor of many realms, able to suppress all with a single palm. The three big shots were all no match for him, and could only retreat and dodge repeatedly.

“Enough!” The Hysteria Demon Master waved a hand, and stopped the battle. Then, he asked the old man, “How should I address you, my friend? From whence have you come?”

The old man chuckled. “I am Tan Feng, and I come from Dongchang.”

Dongchang?

What galaxy or planet was this?

The Demon Masters all looked at one another, and could see confusion in each other’s eyes.

“Friend Tan, your disciples may all enter. However, as there is a force on the level of Black Demon, at least, if we enter, we would become the target of attack of this force. Thus, we all need to wait here,” the old female Demon Master explained.

Tan Feng showed a hint of surprise, but he immediately withdrew his shock. He nodded, and said, “Mo’er, take good care of your clansmen.”

“Understood.” Tan Mo nodded respectfully. Then, he nodded at his four clansmen. They took the lead in entering into the stone arched doorway. Once they passed through, their figures became endlessly smaller, and then disappeared from view. Even the Demon Masters could no longer catch sight of them.

The others all looked livid. This clearly was an ancient site that they had discovered, and not only did they have to share it with outsiders now, the latter even entered the ancient site before them.

But if they encountered these five people inside the ancient site, they unfortunately could only avoid them. Tan Mo was too strong!

“Go on!”

Ling Han and the others also walked towards the stone arched doorway one after another. Their figures disappeared in succession, and when they reappeared, they had already entered into the ancient site. There was an endless and boundless ocean before their eyes.

This was expected because they could already see this from the outside. However, because they had not experienced it personally, they could not imagine just how wide and expansive this massive ocean was.

The first step was to cross the ocean.

Ling Han stood in midair. Ahead of him, a great many people were already in the midst of crossing the ocean, and there was completely no trace of Tan Mo and his group who had been the first to enter.

“There is something I need here,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.
