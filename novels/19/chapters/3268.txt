Chapter 3269 - 3269: I Want to Listen to Young Master

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“If I don’t scram, do you still want to hit me?” Xu Youliang smiled and said. He was a little despicable.

Without hesitation, Lian Xuerong lashed out with her whip.

“She’s really a hot pepper!” Xu Youliang gritted his teeth and quickly retaliated.

Lian Xuerong’s strength was not weaker than his at all. He did not dare to be careless. Otherwise, he might be immediately defeated and embarrass himself in front of everyone.

The battle between two Blood Transformation Tier elites made everyone unable to take their eyes off it.

Unlike Tuoba Tianhuang who fought Xu Youliang, Lian Xuerong was a peerless beauty with such a good figure. Her breasts were especially dazzling and they trembled along with her heartbeat, causing one’s nose to bleed.

It could be said that everyone was leaning towards Lian Xuerong winning, but in order to admire the beauty for a while longer, they also hoped that the two of them could fight for a while longer.

Hu Yang was a little surprised. He did not expect that Xu Youliang, the second-in-command of the Hu Clan Gang, would actually be unable to succeed twice in a row.

It couldn’t be helped. The new students recruited this time were different from before.

Before this, those who entered the academy were all in the Meridian Opening Tier, but this time, Blood Transformation Tier elites directly entered. Not only was there a prodigy like Tuoba Tianhuang, but there was also a Third Change like Lian Xuerong.

Therefore, it was normal for Xu Youliang to fail twice.

Then… he could only make a move himself.

“Youliang, stand down!” He said as he dashed out and pressed his palm towards Lian Xuerong.

His strength was too powerful. As a Fifth Change, and added with the fact that he had once reached twenty meridians in the Meridian Opening Tier, he would absolutely crush an ordinary Third Change.

Lian Xuerong was immediately forced back. She spat out a mouthful of blood and sat on the ground.

She was beautiful and moving. The way she bled at the corner of her mouth did not make people pity her. Instead, it was filled with the temptation of violence, making people want to ravage her to their heart’s content, wanting to tear her clothes apart and expose her hot figure completely.

A sense of violence rose in Hu Yang’s heart. This beauty was really alluring. It made him impulsive and want to take her in the most violent way.

He hurriedly suppressed this impulse and said to everyone, “Is there anyone else who doesn’t want to join the Hu Clan Gang?”

No one spoke. Hu Yang displayed his powerful strength and domineering style as soon as he came up. His attitude was that one would live if he submitted to him, and die if he opposed him. It was suffocating.

Moreover, everyone knew the rules of the academy. The strong preyed on the weak. If they did not join the Hu Clan Gang, they would probably continue to encounter trouble in the future.

Forget it, let it be. In any case, the Hu Clan Gang was not weak. In the future, they would have a backer in the academy.

“I want to listen to Young Master!” At this moment, a young girl carrying a pig stood up and said weakly.

Hu Yang looked over and couldn’t help but reveal a look of surprise.

He had already dealt with two troublemakers, but he did not expect the third one to be such a weak girl who seemed to say “yes” to everything.

What Young Master?

Could it be that this woman was someone’s maid?

A maid could also join the Imperial Capital Academy?

Wasn’t this lowering the level of the entire academy?

“Your young master?” Hu Yang asked. Which noble clan’s descendant was this? He actually let his maid participate in the screening. Was she going to continue serving him in the academy?

“Yes, yes, yes!” Huan Xue nodded repeatedly. She didn’t have any strong opinions of her own. In any case, she would listen to Young Master in all matters.

“Oh, who is your young master?” Hu Yang asked again.

“My young master is Ling Han,” Huan Xue said.

Hu Yang was stunned. He remembered that this name was also among this batch of freshmen.

Hmph, a commoner dared to put on airs and bring a maid into the academy?

What a joke. One had to know that even second-generation and third-generation young masters did not bring servants in. ‘Alright, I’ll deal with this so-called “Young Master” next.’

“Where is he?” Hu Yang asked.

“Not here,” Tuoba Tianhuang interrupted.

“Oh?” Hu Yang sneered. “How arrogant. I’ve been here for a long time, but this kid still hasn’t appeared?”

He paused for a moment and said, “Youliang.”

“Yes,” Xu Youliang said hurriedly.

“Go and call him over,” Hu Yang said.

“Yes, Brother Yang.” Xu Youliang nodded. He immediately sent someone to find Ling Han’s room and bring him out.

Hu Yang sneered. Tuoba Tianhuang had alreadv pledged allegiance to him, and Lian Xuerong was a great beauty with a fiery figure and an alluring charm. He couldn’t bear to really hit her, so this Ling Han had become his ideal target.

He would not show mercy.

Peng! Peng!

At this moment, two figures suddenly flew out horizontally. After drawing a curve, they landed on the ground with a bang.

When Hu Yang saw this, his face couldn’t help but darken.

These two people were sent by Xu Youliang to “invite” Ling Han. However, while they had walked in, they had been sent flying out. Wasn’t this a slap to his face?

Who was the real person trying to use intimidation tactics here?

Ling Han also walked out, his face full of displeasure.

He was absorbing the energy of the Red Clouds Stone, but he was disturbed. Naturally, he was furious.

“Banner Lord Lian?” He saw Lian Xuerong. There was blood at the corner of her mouth and her hair was a little messy. She had clearly fought with someone and suffered a loss.

He was the most protective person. Not only had Lian Xuerong come from Huju City like him, but she was also the only survivor of the Xuanqing Banner. Now that he saw Lian Xuerong suffer a loss, he naturally flew into a rage.

“Who hit her?” he asked coldly, but his gaze was fixed on Hu Yang and the others.

Hu Yang snorted. “Brat, you hit my men and you still dare to be so aggressive?”

“Who’s going to take him down?” he said.

“I’ll do it!”

“I’ll do it!”

The members of the Hu Clan Gang all requested to fight. In their opinion, no matter how strong a Meridian Opening Tier cultivator was, there was still a limit.

However, Tuoba Tianhuang stepped out. “Let me!”

He had always wanted to teach Ling Han a lesson, but was stopped by Lian Xuerong, so he naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity.

Ling Han couldn’t help but glare at Tuoba Tianhuang. He was unconcerned about Tuoba Tianhuang’s competing with him, but Tuoba Tianhuang had actually defected to the enemy and helped the older students bully the new students. This was something he couldn’t accept.

Hu Yang could immediately tell that there was definitely a personal feud between Ling Han and Tuoba Tianhuang. He smiled, and said, “Alright, I’ll let you have it.”

Tuoba Tianhuang strode towards Ling Han. “Ling Han, you’re too arrogant!” Ling Han shook his head. “Tuoba Tianhuang, you disappoint me.”

“You’re not worthy of saying such things to me!” Tuoba Tianhuang roared, and charged towards Ling Han.

Peng, his speed instantly reached the speed of sound. The sonic boom exploded behind him, setting off a shocking wave of air.

In an instant, he had already appeared in front of Ling Han, and threw a punch over.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In this attack, he did not release his power, nor did he use his murderous aura to suppress Ling Han. Instead, he wrapped his power around his fist, precisely because he wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his fist directly hitting Ling Han’s body.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and also threw a punch.

BANG!

Their fists collided. If one looked closely, they could see that there was actually a gap between their fists. That was the force they wrapped around their fists.

Neither of them took a step back, and they were evenly matched!
