2787 Water level recedes

Everyone was dumbfounded again.

A Fourth Tier was being stepped on by Ling Han, while another was rendered speechless—Ling Han really intended to defy the heavens.

Of course, there was a restriction on all this: they had to be in the second spatial level.

“Brat!” He Liqun gritted his teeth, his gaze darkened as if he was about to spit fire.

!!

“Still misbehaving?” Peng, peng, peng, Ling Han stomped his foot several times, causing He Liqun to groan agonizingly as the pain penetrated deep into his bones.

Everyone sighed ruefully. Who else here was capable of being Ling Han’s match?

They looked at Geng Xuandan, who was an elite ranked seventh on the recent leaderboard on the second spatial level, and then at Cheng Guangqi, who was a prodigy ranking ninth, as well as Shi Yuyuan, who was ranked 10th.

There were also elites on the recent leaderboard of the third and fourth spatial levels, many of whom were ranked within the top 500.

The eyes of these people flickered as they were inwardly calculating the probability of winning in battle against Ling Han. With the suppression of power, the possibility of them winning… was less than 10%.

In a battle of equal level, there was only a 10% chance of winning, and they were already elites listed on the recent leaderboard.

Upon comparison, Ling Han’s formidable strength stood out remarkably.

“Are you going to behave now?” Ling Han lowered his head and looked towards He Liqun.

He Liqun gritted his teeth and remained silent. He was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so how could he not even have this much of a backbone? As a person, he could be defeated, but couldn’t show any weakness, and couldn’t lose his dignity. Once they got out… he would make Ling Han know the meaning of regret.

“If you continue to misbehave, then you will be beaten until you do behave.” Ling Han started hitting him again. He was indifferent since he wasn’t the one who was getting beaten anyway.

He Liqun was in misery. Soon, he was being hit until he was riddled with injuries. However, a Heavenly Venerate’s self-healing ability was indeed powerful. Even though he was not specialized in defense, a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was so much more powerful than a First Tier, and his self-healing ability was of course stronger as well.

He was continuously hit until he was severely wounded, and then speedily recovered. The same cycle repeated again and again, causing him to feel like this was a fate that was worse than death.

“This brat has a bit of the same graceful and charming demeanor as myself back then.” The black donkey stood up, his face filled with admiration.

“…You are merely at the First Tier, so what do you mean by ‘back then’?” The big black dog exposed him mercilessly. “This brat took after me, I have endured all sorts of hardships to raise him.”

Yuan Yinglong felt dizzy, his feet were wobbly, and he couldn’t stand steadily.

He was scared indeed. He had originally thought that he had found a powerful helper, but it turned out the latter was a supreme bringer of misfortune.

He Liqun was stubborn and refused to beg for mercy. This was his bottom line. If he begged for mercy in public, he would no longer be able to face others in the future.

Since Ling Han had free time, he kept thrashing He Liqun while waiting for the water level to drop.

No one persuaded him anymore. Firstly, they were no match for Ling Han, and secondly, they didn’t have any friendly relations with He Liqun, so why should they bother to embarass themselves?

Four days passed in this manner, and the water level had dropped out of sight.

Everyone jumped into the lake, which now had become a huge pit, one after another.

Ling Han also sent He Liqun flying with a kick; he couldn’t kill him, or he wouldn’t be able to return to the Realm Battlefield in the future.

He wasn’t afraid that He Liqun would take revenge on him. In the second spatial level, he was invincible. Furthermore, he wouldn’t be trapped there forever. When he advanced to the Second Tier, battling a Fourth Tier would definitely not be a problem.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han nodded towards the Empress and the others.

One by one, they jumped into what was initially a lake, and moved downwards swiftly.

“Boss, what should we do?” Depend Radiance asked.

Yuan Yinglong gritted his teeth. “We have already gotten in too deep, and we can’t withdraw now, so we will follow Ling Han this time! Once we leave, we will find a way to draw a clear dividing line.”

“Yes.” Depend Radiance and the others nodded.

Ling Han took the lead, and stepped on the walls of the lake. With a burst of strength, he was moving at lightning speed.

Only half a day later, everyone arrived once again at the surface of the lake.

The lake hadn’t been drained, and by this time, the whirlpool had already disappeared and the water level had stopped falling.

However, one could already see the bottom of the lake here, and it was no more than 30,000 meters or so, and such a distance was nothing to a Heavenly Venerate.

Therefore, some people were eager to give it a try. It was only 30,000 meters or so, so it would be impossible for the water pressure to reach an unbearable level, right?

“Let’s go!”

Splash, splash, several people had immediately dived towards the bottom of the lake, and among them were several Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han and the Empress looked at each other, and similarly jumped into the lake. They possessed strength beyond the First Tier, and were capable of conquering all opposition in this place.

After entering the lake, Ling Han and the Empress immediately felt the incoming pressure, but they each formed a defensive shield around themselves to keep the water pressure out. Now the pressure wasn’t a big deal to them.

The others also jumped into the lake one by one, and everyone’s strength could now be seen clearly.

Some people were no longer able to bear it after diving down to about 3,000 meters. Their shields shattered, and the skin of their entire bodies instantly ruptured under the pressure of the water, staining the surrounding waters with blood. They had no choice but to float upwards, or they would be seeking death for themselves.

There were some people who could reach 6,000 meters deep before they had to float upwards, while some managed to hold on until 9,000 meters. This was the most direct display of one’s physical might.

When the depth had reached 15,000 meters, there were less than 100 people left.

On Ling Han’s side, other than the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and Rain Emperor, the others had long since been unable to last any longer. Moreover, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and Rain Emperor were also finding it unbearable, and their shields were on the verge of collapse.

However, at this point, one could see the Heavenly Venerable Seal below more clearly. Although it was not more exposed, owing to the fact that there were no longer any undulations in the lake waters, the refractive index was reduced, and one could naturally see it even more vividly.

These two people stopped here, studying this particular seal.

Ling Han and the Empress continued on heading downwards; they were still very far from reaching their limit.

18,000 meters, 21,000 meters, and to Ling Han’s surprise, there were still other people at this depth.

Those comprised Geng Xuandan, Cheng Guangqi, Shi Yuyuan, Shi Zhonghe, Shi Mengyu, and some others, who were all high-ranking figures on the recent leaderboard of each spatial level, but on the contrary, those several bigwigs of the fifth spatial level were nowhere to be seen.

Here, where one’s cultivation level was being suppressed, surviving would depend on one’s capability in a battle of equal levels, and it was by no means the case that the higher one’s cultivation level, the stronger one would be in this situation.

Take Ling Han, the Empress, Geng Xuandan, and the others for example.

These people had always maintained a low profile, and it was only now that their strength which surpassed the First Tier had erupted. However, they were also extremely surprised as they didn’t expect that there were actually so many people like themselves.

...

They cast a glance at each other, and continued diving further downwards.

What Ling Han saw was everyone displaying their unique abilities. Most of them were being wrapped by blurry seals, resisting the pressure of the lake water. There were also a few who, like Ling Han and the Empress, were exceptionally calm. In the same way, they merely formed a shield and resisted the pressure using their own power.

Those who had manifested the seals obviously had mastered Heavenly Venerable Seals. Furthermore, they weren’t the most widely known seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, but rather were seals obtained from other channels, and were more powerful and supported them in their journey here.

But what Ling Han cared more about were those people who didn’t manifest any seals.

They could come this far without Heavenly Venerable Seals?

Why was this so? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han looked at the Empress, and the latter nodded towards Ling Han. Perhaps these people had also mastered the unique power of several dimensions, or there was no other way to explain it.

The Empress, whose Evolution Index was about 11, could accommodate the power of 100 dimensions. Even without Wally’s theory and Ling Han’s assistance, the difficulty of this wasn’t so high that it couldn’t be replicated.
