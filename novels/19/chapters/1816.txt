Chapter 1817: Contesting for the powerful weapon

A group of dwarves were chattering excitedly there. Though they spoke very fiercely, they should not have killed anyone before, and now all of them were making a big fuss over it, as if the skies had collapsed and the earth had cracked open.

And Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others all had strange expressions, and they really could not accept this.

A mere Shattering Void Tier had killed a king tier of Severing Mundane Tier. What kind of absurd matter was this?

Everyone’s eyes were set on the staffs that these dwarves were holding. It was because this thing had shown its power and Qianzhao Tian had been insta-killed with a single strike.

What kind of treasure was this that could actually allow one to breach innumerable cultivation levels and succeed in making an ultimate kill?

If this kind of thing could be used on a large scale, then the strength of a force would undergo an absolute revolution. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Even if the power of this thing was only limited to Dividing Soul Tier, when several hundred, or several thousand attacked all at once, then even Dividing Soul Tier great elites would have a slight headache, right? Then what if there were tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands?

It was possible that even an Immortal Palace Tier elite would have to make a strategic withdrawal!

With such thoughts, the eyes of Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others shone brightly. Furthermore, more importantly, as long as they could take hold of a single staff, that meant that they would be invincible in this Mystery Realm—all of them were Severing Mundane Tiers, but this thing could kill a third severance as easily as killing a chicken. It would probably succeed easily against a fourth severance. If that was the case, who would be able to match them any longer?

What Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun? In front of them, everyone would be trash!

Furthermore, you didn’t have a staff “weapon”, yet I did. That meant I had the absolute upper hand—how frightening would that intimidation tactic be?

In the hands of these dwarves, this staff weapon did not pose much of a threat. That was because though the beam of light that was shot out was so fast that it could not be dodged, a process of firing still had to take place. The instant that the trigger was pulled, with the speed of Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others, they were completely capable of dodging.

Previously, Qianzhao Tian had been hit only because he had been too careless, but who would believe that Shattering Void Tier would actually be capable of threatening a Severing Mundane Tier?

But if this staff weapon had fallen into the hands of a Severing Mundane Tier, then its threat level would undoubtedly increase millions and millions of times over. That was because even the process of firing would be practically negligible, and the difference between life and death would be decided in an instant.

Everyone had a grim expression. If any one of them could snatch one of these staff weapons, that was equivalent to gaining possession of the ability to decide the life or death of others. In fact, they could kill anyone in a single instant.

These people all showed their killing intent, and set their eyes on those dwarves that were still feeling conflicted over having killed one of the Giants by accident. In the eyes of these heirs, Holy Sons, and Holy Daughters of great sects and noble clans, there was no need to take the deaths of 1,000 or even 10,000 of these mere natives to heart.

Xiu, Beiyu Xiong was the first to make his move. He was a fourth severance peak stage king tier, and was sure that he could kill these dwarves in an instant. He would not give them the slightest chance of resistance.

Boom!

He shot out a punch, and a frightening force surged out. The Regulations of the Great Dao turned into a powerful storm that blasted out towards those dwarves.

With his strength, this would be an insta-kill. In fact, these dwarves didn’t even have the time to sense the approach of death.

Peng!

A loud bang rang out, and a powerful force suddenly split the air apart. Ling Han appeared in front of these dwarves. One hand was put up in an attacking position. It was him that had sliced apart Beiyu Xiong’s fatal attack, and saved the lives of these dwarves.

Merely in terms of battle prowess, Ling Han was still far from being a match for Beiyu Xiong. His figure was forcefully blasted back, and all the bones in his body cracked loudly.

Even so, the dwarves were still blown head over heels by the aftermath. Some were even seriously injured, and throwing up blood madly.

In front of a fourth severance king tier, they were really much too weak.

“The Giants turned bad!”

“Attack! Attack!”

The dwarves had all lost their heads in fear. They all raised the staffs in their hands. All of a sudden, multiple beams of light shot out, filling the skies with their brilliance.

Since they already knew how frightening this object could be, Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others were naturally long since prepared. They had long since used their movement techniques, and already dodged away before these beams of light had been shot out—by the time the beams of light were shot out, even they could not possibly dodge successfully.

Thankfully, the dwarves still knew how to distinguish friend from foe, and did not attack Ling Han and the Empress.

“Ling Han, you are actually assisting another race, humph!” Beiyu Xiong declared coldly. At first, he could have insta-killed these natives with a single strike. What need would he have to dodge here and there like what he was doing now?

Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back, and calmly said, “I have no objection to contesting over treasures, but if it’s something like killing the innocents, I cannot bring myself to do it, nor can I approve of it!”

Beiyu Xiong’s expression was livid. Even Lin Fang and the others looked unconcerned. In their eyes, what were mere Shattering Void Tiers worth? They were so weak that they could not even be considered human! For a powerful weapon like the staff weapon, even if they had to slaughter an entire city, they would not have the slightest hesitation at all.

This rule in this world was that the weak would be prey to the strong!

“Ling Han, with your kind of Dao Heart, are you still qualified to pursue the pinnacle of cultivation? What a joke!” Beiyu Xiong said in disdain, while his figure was flashing continuously. The attacks of the dwarves surged forwards like floodwaters, and now the lights blazed. There was absolutely no way that they could come any closer. They were completely flying around randomly. Anyone who dared come close would definitely have as many holes as a beehive.

Ling Han remained unmoved. These people had not managed to advance by striking the heaven and earth, so could it be that what they severed was their own conscience?

As humans, we needed to have a bottom line. If there was no bottom line, humans could not be called humans, but could only be considered monsters.

It was no wonder that one had to strike the heaven and earth to become a Celestial King. Without that kind of presence, how could they be qualified to become the strongest in the world?

“Let’s join forces, and see how he can save them all!” Beiyu Xiong said to the others.

Teng Sen, Lin Fang, and the others all nodded. Even if not for the sake of the great opportunity, and only for the sake of those staff weapons, they would have to move too.

If they obtained one, then they would be able to gain a complete advantage in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. At least, there was no need for them to fear anyone.

Ling Han frowned. He was only one person, but there was no shortage of fourth severance peak stage elites among Beiyu Xiong and the others. He himself had a strong physique, and needed not be afraid, but if any of these dwarves was just scraped by the strong winds, they would definitely be beheaded or lose a limb.

Moreover, the Empress was presently unable to match a fourth severance, what more king tiers at fourth severance peak stage.

What to do now?

“The members of the Gururu Tribe, all of you enter into my Spatial God Tool!” Ling Han said. To hide the existence of the Black Tower, he had long since prepared a Spatial God Tool, and immediately threw that out.

The dwarves were a little bewildered. What the heck was a Spatial God Tool?

There was actually no cultivation system at all in this place. By birth, they were already in the Shattering Void Tier, and when they died, they would still be in the Shattering Void Tier. They only knew how to use their “staff weapons”.

“Soft-hearted fool!” Lin Fang and Teng Sen both made their moves.

There were a total of 14 of them. Excluding Ling Han and the Empress, as well as Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun who had set off on their own and Qianzhao Tian who had died, only nine remained. Now, aside from Bewitching Maiden Rou, the others all showed twisted expressions as they unleashed their attacks respectively.

With a powerful weapon like the staff weapon, even Ling Han’s strong physique would not hold up to a single blow!

...Would you be able to stand up against the power of Regulation of Dividing Soul Tier?

Bewitching Maiden Rou had a moment of conflict, and finally made her move. However, the target of her attack was not Ling Han and the Empress, or the dwarves, but rather Beiyu Xiong and his group!

Though she was a great bewitching maiden, a great demoness, she had her own bottom line!
