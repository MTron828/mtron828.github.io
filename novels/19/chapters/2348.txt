Chapter 2349: Huai Jian’s invitation

In the area of analysis, Ling Han was only impressed with Wally.

Since the latter said that Little Terror was worth nurturing, then it was definitely worth nurturing.

Ling Han couldn’t help but rub his chin. Could he find a female for this kind of powerful Battle Beast so that it could have a bunch of kids, and let him build a powerful troop of Battle Beasts?

However, the little guy had just hatched. It was a little inappropriate to have such ideas about it now.

Never mind, never mind. He’d wait and see when it was older.

Little Terror seemed to have sensed Ling Han’s gaze, and involuntarily shuddered. It looked towards Ling Han, its gaze plaintive.

Ling Han laughed loudly. With a mere thought, the little guy immediately stopped obediently, and made no further move to attack.

He picked the little guy up, and then took out a great number of alchemical pills and celestial medicines. “Come, little guy, eat some more, so you can grow up quickly!” His eyes shone, already planning to use Little Terror like a stud.

Hold on, was the little guy male or female?

He couldn’t help but turn his eyes to the spot between the legs of the little guy, causing the little guy to break out in an involuntary shudder as it clamped its legs together tightly. ‘Even if you are my master, you cannot peep on my private areas!’

‘Yi, this little guy can’t have developed wariness, right? It would be reluctant even if I had it mate in the future.

‘Little guy, that is a fun activity; what kind of mood are you having!

‘True, it is still too young. It will change in future.’

“Ba!” Right at this moment, a voice rang out from outside.

Ling Han heard it, and couldn’t help but appear slightly surprised. A dashing, incredibly handsome young man of the Angel Race stood outside his door. He had a captivating demeanor as well, and others would feel the urge to worship him.

Huai Jian.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “There weren’t any residual effects, right?”

The other had broken through to the Ninth Lotus in a state of severe injury. The slightest accident could cause a serious Dao injury, which would be a great problem.

Huai Jian cracked a smile. “I do indeed have some injuries, but I see them as a kind of grinding stone. After I erase this Dao injury, my battle prowess will be further boosted.”

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed, and he said, “You actually can completely expel your internal injuries, right?”

Huai Jian was taken aback slightly, and only then replied, “You have guessed correctly. That is indeed the case.”

This guy was really mad that he would actually dare to deliberately leave an internal injury inside his body when he was breaking through just to temper himself! Ling Han pondered; even he would not dare to mess around like that. That was completely playing with fire.

But it could not be denied that if Huai Jian had really destroyed that Dao injury with his own powerful determination and willpower, his battle prowess would indeed have been raised to a frightening height.

True, he wanted to surpass Ling Han, so he would definitely have to use a method that was not normal. That was because they had already reached the normal limits, or even far surpassed them long ago. To further improve from the limits, they could only resort to extreme methods.

There was actually not much difference between a prodigy and a maniac.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Have you sought me out for another fight?” His fighting spirit was very strong. Sparring with an elite like Huai Jian was greatly beneficial for him.

Huai Jian shook his head. “I am already a Ninth Lotus, but you are only in the Eighth Lotus. If I exchanged blows with you, that would be an unjust victory. When you advance to the Ninth Lotus, we will battle again.”

“All right!” Ling Han did not force the matter. Monarch Stars were naturally proud, what more when it was Huai Jian.

“I have sought you out today just to ask if you have the interest to take Lord Desolate Eternity as master with me,” Huai Jian said solemnly.

“Lord Desolate Eternity?” Ling Han appeared slightly surprised.

Who was this now?

Huai Jian was also surprised, and asked, “Could it be that you don’t know who Lord Desolate Eternity is?”

Ling Han scratched his head. “I really don’t.”

Huai Jian shook his head. “Lord Desolate Eternity is a Heavenly Venerate!”

Oh, so this was a Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “How could a Heavenly Venerate possibly take me as a disciple?”

Huai Jian shook his head, and said, “You are being too modest here. Your aptitude has far surpassed that of a great majority of descendants of Heavenly Venerates. If you still couldn’t gain the serious notice of a Heavenly Venerate, I would not be able to bring myself to introduce you, either!”

A Heavenly Venerate did not have many descendants, but because his bloodline was too powerful, it was extremely easy for Monarch Stars to emerge from his bloodline, ones that could attain up to the height of Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King, but they could not even dream of being capable of going beyond the threshold of the Ancestral Kings. At the very least, there had never been a legend of two Heavenly Venerates emerging from the same line in the Foreign Realm.

However, there was still difference in strength among Monarch Stars, just like in the promised battle between the Foreign Realm and Celestial Realm, when Ji Wuming was practically capable of matching Chi Xue; furthermore, it was in a situation when the former was inferior by a minor level at that.

Chi Xue was a Monarch Star, and was also a descendant of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan, but even then, so what? In a battle of equals, Ji Wuming would definitely win!

Ling Han’s brain immediately became active. Should he agree?

Actually, he very much wanted to come in contact with a Heavenly Venerate. Since he, too, wanted to step into this threshold, if he came in contact with it beforehand, it would be easier for him to have a clear glimpse of the path that lay ahead of him. But the problem here was this: with the insight of a Heavenly Venerate, would his Heaven Deceiving Technique be capable of deceiving him?

Hold on, didn’t he have Wally?

Ling Han paused silently, and said, “Allow me to consider… Could I give you a reply tomorrow?”

Huai Jian was unbelievably stunned. He still had to consider this?

F***, this was sending you to become the disciple of a Heavenly Venerate, not demanding that you go to the battlefield. How many Monarch Stars were there that wanted this opportunity but were not granted it, and you actually said that you wanted to consider? If it had to be anyone considering, it should be Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity.

If it were not for the fact that Huai Jian admired Ling Han very much, and had a strong wish to defeat this opponent in the future, and thus did not wish that Ling Han was too weak, he would definitely have turned around and left by now.

“All right then,” he agreed.

When Huai Jian had left, Ling Han immediately called Wally over, and questioned him.

“You want to fool an existence that has a Vitality Index over 15,000?” Wally’s eyes lit up and dimmed, seeming to be going through the process of calculation and deduction. After a while, he said, “No way, you cannot do it.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. It looked like his hope of getting in close contact with a Heavenly Venerate was going to be fruitless.

“However, if I help you do some modifications, you should be able to do so.” Who would have expected Wally would come around with a major turn of events.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break in a cold sweat. Could it be that Wally had been influenced by him, and had now learned to joke around as well?

“Teach me,” he said.

Wally did not immediately teach him, but rather asked him to teach him the Heaven Deceiving Technique, which he would then modify further.

Ling Han exerted time acceleration effects on him. Half a day later, Wally’s eyes snapped open.

“It’s done.” He nodded, and his eyes shone. Teaching the modified Heaven Deceiving Technique through formulae and models, he said, “This is also slightly helpful for me, allowing me to better conceal myself, so I will not collect payment from you.”

Right, this guy hadn’t changed in the slightest.

Ling Han looked at these formulae and models, and felt a headache coming on, but Wally would only display the “cultivation technique” in this format.

In his eyes, the world was like this. It was a massive model, and this giant model could be further divided into countless formulae. Everything had a logic that could be traced.

Ling Han ignored that first. Not only did he memorize these formulae and models, the women were no exception, either.

Primarily, it was the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou. For the other women, their cultivation levels were too low, so there was not much meaning for them to cultivate the Heaven Deceiving Technique, as they would not be able to fool many people. They had best just obediently stay inside the Black Tower.

A day passed, and when Huai Jian came again, Ling Han nodded decisively. “Sure, let’s go together.”

Huai Jian couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. He was not begging Ling Han here.

…Did you feel so very unfortunate to become a disciple of a Heavenly Venerate?
