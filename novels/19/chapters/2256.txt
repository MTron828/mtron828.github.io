Chapter 2257: Chi Xue

The Foreign Realm quickly sent forth a new challenger.

It was a giant centipede that measured 300 meters in length. Each segment of its body was pitch-black, and there were also blade-like spikes growing on the fringes of its exoskeleton. Just its appearance alone was enough to make one nauseous.

Looking closely, there were also numerous symbols on its body.

These were the Regulations of Poison. However, they didn’t need to strike their targets, and just a glance at them would activate the effects of the Regulations. Ordinary Immortal Palace Tier elites would be immediately killed.

The Celestial Kings on both sides immediately took action, blocking Wu Xin’s Regulations off from the cultivators on their side. Otherwise, it would be hard to say how many people would be killed.

The Regulation of Poison was extremely domineering.

“Wu Xin!” the centipede said with his divine sense. Like a snake, a third of his body arched into the air as he breathed a cloud of black air. However, this wasn’t the Regulation of Poison. Instead, it was the Regulation of Slaughter, which had materialized into a God Tool that appeared powerful enough to cut the skies.

Ji Wuming remained silent yet again as he charged forward to engage in battle.

Wu Xin didn’t face his attacks head-on. Just then, he had already been notified by the Celestial Kings to prioritize defense. That way, he could exhaust Ji Wuming’s power of Regulations, and achieve certain victory.

Even though he was displeased about this, he had no option but to do as he was told. After all, the gulf between him and the Celestial Kings was far too great. As wanton as he was, he still didn’t dare to disobey them. Moreover, this battle was far too important for the Foreign Realm. They definitely had to win this battle at the same cultivation level. Moreover, he was the last person who could achieve this.

If Chi Xue stepped forward, they could naturally win with ease. However, a victory gained by relying on his cultivation level to suppress his opponent naturally wouldn’t be satisfying. It was also insufficient to suppress the morale of the Celestial Realm.

He activated a movement technique, and did his best to evade.

Even though his body was long, his agility was astonishing, and each of his legs was more so able to unleash devastating auras of slaughter. Combined with his potent poison, people could only give him a wide berth.

However, his opponent was Ji Wuming!

He was a domineering being who had massacred prodigies of the Foreign Realm in his previous life! Today, he was even more powerful!

As if transforming into a primordial heavenly demon, Ji Wuming emanated with a boundless killing intent that churned like the sea.

He finally unleashed his renowned ultimate ability. Transforming into a Vajra Battle God, he completely ignored Wu Xin’s attacks as he charged forward, and made a tapping motion.

Weng!

Time be old, and the ancient be desolate.

Boom!

A bloody and gaping wound instantly appeared on Wu Xin’s back. In fact, he was almost slashed in two.

“Eternity Tap!” everyone exclaimed. This included several Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm. They had suffered at the hands of this celestial technique before, and it could be said that they had suffered huge casualties.

“It’s truly that mighty being!” the Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm exclaimed. They almost clasped their heads in surprise, and they had no care about their demeanor as Celestial Kings at this moment.

Only Ji Wuming was completely unfazed. Right now, he was simply intent on killing Wu Xin. His Vajra Battle God state allowed him to directly ignore Wu Xin’s counterattacks. Meanwhile, he continued to unleash his Eternity Tap, and it was as if he yearned to forcefully obliterate this heaven and earth.

After just 100 exchanges, Wu Xin was dragged away, and rescued by the Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm. Otherwise, he would have been killed.

At this moment, the Foreign Realm fell deathly silent. This was a one-versus-three situation, and these were more so battles at the same cultivation level. Only they should have been able to achieve this, yet right now, a cultivator from the Celestial Realm had also achieved this.

He was far too powerful, no? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If such a person went to the Foreign Realm... Just how powerful would he become?

Meanwhile, the cultivators from the Celestial Realm started to chant Ji Wuming’s name again. The Celestial Kings were more so filled with emotion. That formidable being had truly returned.

He was a staunch proponent for battle, and he was as assertive as could be. With him present, even if the Celestial Realm were at a disadvantage, he could still rile their fighting spirit 100-fold.

“We have no option but to send Chi Xue.”

“Also, call some more people over. In a moment, we’re going to kill this reincarnation of that death god. The Celestial Realm will definitely resist, so just the few of us aren’t enough.”

“Indeed!”

The nine Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm secretly made contact, desiring to call more Celestial Kings over. Ji Wuming was far too terrifying, so they had to dispose of him as soon as possible.

On the other side, the Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm also delivered news of this. They could predict that the Foreign Realm wouldn’t let Ji Wuming off the hook so easily, so they also wanted to call more Celestial Kings over to protect this reincarnation of that mighty being.

In the future, he was destined to become a general of the Celestial Realm.

The Foreign Realm remained silent for a long time before a man finally dashed over. With a single step, he was able to cover a boundless distance.

“Chi Xue!” The chants and cheers from the Foreign Realm were thunderous.

This was their true pillar—a supreme Monarch Star at the 11th layer of the Eighteenth Lotus. His battle prowess had more so entered the Ascending Origin Tier, and his strength was simply indescribable.

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm all looked toward this prodigy. He was a humanoid, and he looked no different from the other members of the Foreign Realm at first glance. However, the aura that was emanating from him was far too terrifying. In fact, even monarch tiers had to prostrate before him.

In the eyes of the Foreign Realm, this was a future Heavenly Venerate.

Chi Xue peered down at Ji Wuming, and a hint of arrogance tugged at the corners of his lips. “Who would’ve thought that there was a competent cultivator in the Celestial Realm? However, it’s beneath me to defeat you at this moment. I’ll give you 1000 years, and we can do battle when you advance to the 11th layer.”

Upon hearing this, both the cultivators from the Foreign Realm and Celestial Realm couldn’t help but find him arrogant.

A Celestial King from the Foreign Realm said in a cold voice, “He’s the reincarnation of the War Buddha! He must be killed!”

Chi Xue gave a slight “oh,” saying, “You’re actually the reincarnation of the War Buddha? Heh, I had yet to be born when you barged into our world at that time. I’ve only heard about you from others.”

He surprisingly didn’t pay any heed to the Celestial King’s command, and this was indeed a reflection of his arrogance. “Now I’m slightly interested in you. Come, let’s exchange a few strikes. Rest assured, it’s beneath me to kill the current you. Only when you reach the same cultivation level as me will I unleash my full power.”

Ji Wuming didn’t immediately attack this time. Instead, he looked Chi Xue up and down, and said, “You’re a descendant of Chi Yan?”

“Indeed, my ancestor is none other than Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan!” Chi Xue said with pride.

Heavenly Venerate!

Everyone was shocked upon hearing this. No wonder Chi Xue was so powerful, and no wonder he dared to ignore Celestial Kings. This was because his ancestor was a Heavenly Venerate.

“Chi Yan?” Ji Wuming said with a cold chuckle. A look of reminiscence flashed across his face, and he said, “He hunted me back in the day, and he left me with unerasable memories.”

Chi Xue roared with laughter, and he said, “My ancestor hunted you back in the day, and now it’s me who’s going to kill you. You trash from the super low-level dimension should give up your resistance earlier, and allow us to engulf your world.”

Ji Wuming didn’t reply anymore. Instead, he used his actions to speak.

“Worthless!” Chi Xue sneered. He replied with a punch.

Peng!

Ji Wuming was instantly sent flying, yet divine light flashed across his body. Surprisingly, he wasn’t annihilated by this strike.

Everyone was astounded.

Just what kind of concept was the 11th layer of the Eighth Lotus?

That was equivalent to the Ascending Origin Tier!

An Ascending Origin Tier elite had attacked an Immortal Palace Tier elite, yet he hadn’t killed him in a single strike? Was this a joke?

It could only be said that Ji Wuming was far too powerful.

“Interesting,” Chi Xue said, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Ji Wuming was truly heaven-defying. He was only at the 10th secret, yet he could actually muster some strength to resist him. If Ji Wuming were also an 11th secret elite, then would he have any hope of victory?

Absolutely not!

Chi Xue knew not about modesty, yet he had to admit that Ji Wuming was far too extraordinary.

Since this was the case, he would kill him right here and now.

Killing intent rose in his mind, and he completely forgot about the words that he had spoken just a moment ago. Right now, there was only a single thought running through his mind: he definitely couldn’t allow Ji Wuming to take another step forward, and therefore threaten him.

“Die!” he roared. He finally unleashed his full strength.

Boom!

Crimson light exploded from his body, dying the entire sky a sanguine red..
