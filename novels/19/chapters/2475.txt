Chapter 2476: Ling Han’s Breakthrough

The Celestial Seed Mark inside Ling Han’s body had already been nearing perfection. In fact, it might have already become perfect, but there had simply been no urgent need for him to advance, so he had kept holding it off until now.

Yet, he was being relentlessly hunted by Dongfang Rui and the two Celestial Kings, and this enraged him immensely.

At the same time, it also stoked a strong desire for him to break through. He wanted to become a Celestial King, and then he wanted to pummel those bastards.

His Celestial Seed was most likely already perfect, flawless. There was no need to nurture it any further. However, breaking through to become a First Heaven Celestial King was a matter of grave importance, one from which there was no turning back. It was because of this that he was being so utterly careful, and it was because of this that he had delayed breaking through for so long.

However, with Ling Han’s personality, once he made up his mind, he would never hesitate again.

He immediately started to break through.

He loosened his cultivation, and his aura instantly rose explosively. Dark clouds gathered overhead, with arcs of lightning cracking amid them. Heavenly tribulation was forming.

This was a Celestial King Tribulation. However, because Ling Han was so powerful, it didn’t appear like an ordinary Celestial King Tribulation at all. Instead, it looked like the tribulation of a Second Heaven Celestial King.

Crack!

A bolt of lightning slammed down, transforming into a giant that had a razor-sharp sword in its hand. It viciously slashed down at Ling Han.

With a roar, Ling Han fearlessly charged forth.

At the same time, he also had to solidify the Celestial Seed Mark in his mind, transforming it into a real and tangible seed. He then had to borrow the power of heavenly tribulation to nurture it. As for how much it could grow, this would be up to his talent and luck. In fact, it was during this stage that Celestial Kings would enjoy the fastest growth and development. Afterward, their advance would slow down significantly.

Ling Han unleashed his Celestial Physique of Time. These few hours were far too important to him, so he couldn’t afford to waste a single second. Not only that, but he even needed to do everything he could to extend this time.

......

Boom!

He was immediately struck by heavenly tribulation, which caused his entire body to disappear. Meanwhile, a huge crater appeared in the ground, measuring a whopping 300 meters deep.

However, in the next instant, Ling Han immediately dashed out from the crater, soaring into the sky. He was fighting a heaven-defying battle.

In fact, facing heavenly tribulation here put Ling Han at a huge disadvantage. This was because he was being suppressed by the purple light, causing his battle prowess to drop significantly. He was completely no match for heavenly tribulation. However, even though he knew this, he still chose to advance here.

There was naturally a good reason for this. The more difficult the circumstances, the greater the benefits if he succeeded in overcoming the odds.

Moreover, Ling Han also wanted to know whether the purple light would be targeted by heavenly tribulation for interfering. After all, it was rumored that this purple light was emitted by the vegetation of this place. If heavenly tribulation targeted them, then even these plants would have to face a tribulation. In the center of these ruins, there were also a large number of Celestial Kings battling with these plants. Thus, would they be dragged into the mess as well?

That would surely be a lively scene.

However, it was a shame that heavenly tribulation wasn’t enraged by the interfering purple light. This disappointed Ling Han greatly.

Ling Han continued to resist heavenly tribulation with his full strength. Otherwise, this Second Heaven Celestial King Tier tribulation could potentially kill him. It was true that he liked to take risks, but he definitely had no desire to commit suicide. Meanwhile, he continued to rapidly solidify the Celestial Seed Mark in his mind.

Rumble…

Heavenly tribulation unleashed its divine might, and it was as if it didn’t want to allow a freak such as Ling Han to advance. Arcs of lightning crashed down, carrying with them the furious Great Dao of Lightning as they smashed into Ling Han.

Ling Han was neither furious nor alarmed. Instead, he continued to focus on what was important.

Under the furious barrage of lightning attacks, Ling Han was like a blade of grass swaying about in the storm. His body was covered in burns, and he looked much like a seared piece of wood. His vitality was as weak as could be, and it was as if he were about to die at any moment.

His Celestial Seed Mark was composed of countless threads, appearing as complex as possible. At this moment, only a single thread remained incomplete.

As long as he completed this thread, it would no longer be a Celestial Seed Mark. Instead, it would become a true Celestial Seed.

Boom, boom, boom!

Heavenly tribulation became increasingly violent. Once Ling Han advanced, his newfound strength would definitely shatter some kind of equilibrium. Thus, heaven and earth had to suppress him no matter what.

Countless lightning giants surrounded Ling Han, furiously attacking him with their lightning-formed weapons. They wanted to kill him.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, forcefully raising his defenses. He then abandoned all resistance, focusing his full attention on the final “thread.”

Even though this was the final step, if he failed to complete it, his battle prowess as a Celestial King would end up at least 10 times weaker.

It was because of the critical importance of this step that Ling Han focused all of his attention on completing the final thread of the Celestial Seed Mark. This was the most critical moment.

Using his divine sense as a guide, he summoned a supremely radiant thread in the air, using it to connect two nodes, and completing the shell of his Celestial Seed.

Boom!

His aura rose explosively, and it was as if he possessed the power to easily crush all celestial bodies.

In the distance, Ji Wuming, the Empress, and the others all watched on.

“He’s indeed extraordinary,” Shi Chanzi said in astonishment. “He’s only just become a Celestial King, yet the might of heavenly tribulation is already comparable to that of Second Heaven Celestial Kings. If I hadn’t witnessed it with my own eyes, I definitely couldn’t have imagined it.”

Ji Wuming remained silent, yet his eyes burned with fighting spirit.

Huo Furong shook her head, and said, “This brat still hasn’t displayed his true abilities yet. I have a feeling that his greatest strength is his Body Art, not his power of Regulations.”

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this.

One had to realize that Ling Han had faced the tribulation of a Second Heaven Celestial King upon advancing to the Celestial King Tier. This was a clear sign of his terrifying power. Yet, she was claiming that this wasn’t Ling Han’s greatest strength? How could they believe this? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, it was Huo Furong who had uttered these words, so who dared to doubt her?

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou all wore proud expressions. Ling Han was someone who could manipulate fundamental powers that only Heavenly Venerates could interact with. This was a power that far exceeded the level of Regulations. Thus, it was only natural that he was as freakish as could be.

Boom, boom, boom!

Heavenly tribulation became increasingly violent, intent on killing Ling Han.

Peng!

The lightning giants attacked in unison, and Ling Han wasn’t able to block them even though he had channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. It wasn’t long before his energy was exhausted, causing the golden sheen on his body to dim.

Whoosh!

The lightning giants attacked again, sending thousands of lightning blades at Ling Han.

“Not good!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. This was the most critical moment for Ling Han. If he chose to block this attack, all of his previous efforts to solidify the Celestial Seed would have been in vain. However, if he continued to ignore heavenly tribulation, he might be ruthlessly struck to death.

This was an incredibly difficult situation.

However, a smile spread across Ling Han’s face. He activated the Great Dao of Time, sending his divine sense into another realm that surpassed time itself.

It was as if everything had become frozen in time. In fact, even the furious attacks of the lightning giants became as slow as a snail’s crawl.

The reactions of Ling Han’s physical body naturally became extremely slow as well. However, his divine sense was transcendent above this. Most importantly, he only needed his divine sense to solidify the Celestial Seed.

A brilliant ray of light formed in his divine sense, connecting the final two nodes. At this moment, his Celestial Seed was finally completed.

Weng!

A powerful aura burst out from Ling Han’s body.

He had already been extremely powerful to begin with, yet he now ascended to a new height.

He was a Celestial King!

At this moment, Ling Han had genuinely broken through to the Celestial King.

His mind relaxed, and he immediately exited this transcendent state.

Boom, boom, boom, boom!

The attacks of the lightning giants instantly accelerated, mercilessly slamming toward him.

‘Come!’

Ling Han was fearless as he clenched his fists and charged forward.
