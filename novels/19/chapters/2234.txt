Chapter 2235: Clear the area

Ling Han and the others entered once more into the neutral zone.

It was a walk in the park for them. Very soon, they arrived back at that valley, but because the effects of beast meat had already been exposed, they had also come across a great number of hunters on their way. Even in this valley, there were people doing a sweep, and trying their luck.

Thankfully, it was still only Immortal Palace Tiers that could enter into the neutral zone, and it looked like this would continue for another period of time, so there was no need to worry that they would encounter an Ascending Origin Tier and be outmatched.

There were not many people in the valley, because the rocks here were too sharp, so everyone would have to step on air. This would expend their power of Regulation, and as time passed, no one would be able to hold on. Thus, everyone merely roamed around, and then left the valley.

The problem was there was a continuous flow of cultivators entering the valley. It was like if they could not check personally, and confirm that there were no newly born Foreign Beasts here, they would not be able to rest easy.

Ling Han and the others arrived at their destination, all of them frowning heavily because there would be people passing by occasionally, and the poison pills that they threw in would cause a great stir from that underground creature, so it would definitely draw over others within the vicinity.

“If there is anyone tactless, then we can only settle it with a battle,” Ling Han said.

The Rain Emperor and the others all nodded. Speaking of battle, they really feared no one. Aside from the fact that they did indeed have extremely strong battle prowess, they also had the Black Tower which could replenish their power of Regulation. This was much more useful than beast meat.

Ling Han took out the poison pills. This time, he had invested a lot, and had concocted a total of 41 pills. If this was still not able to deal with that creature, then he, all five of them, would really have a great loss.

“Yi, high-grade Celestial pills!” Someone passed by, then immediately came back, and shouted, “Let go of the Celestial pills!”

Ling Han looked over. That was a young man with lanky build, dressed in embroidered robes, yet they could not distinguish whether he was a native or a student of the Saintly Origin Academy just from that, because the attire of natives now was also very much keeping up with the trends.

“Why?” he asked, yet his hand loosened its grip, and all 41 poison pills instantly rolled downwards following the cave mouth.

“Damn you!” The man was furious, and thought that Ling Han would rather waste so many Celestial pills instead of handing them over to him. He stretched out his hand. His Origin Power took the form of multiple thin chains that darted into that cave mouth, wanting to stop the progress of the Celestial pills.

As for Ling Han… He would deal with him once he had retrieved the Celestial pills. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Scram!” The Rain Emperor humphed, and shot out a punch. An aura that dominated the world surged out, and that person was instantly forced backwards.

The man was stunned, and only then did he look seriously towards Ling Han and his group as he said, “I couldn’t tell that you outsiders would actually have such strength!” He was a Fourth Secret, and should be an emperor tier.

“Go, go, go, kid, don’t disturb our playtime.” Hu Niu waved her hand dismissively.

Playtime?

The man’s expression was strange. ‘You guys have taken out so many Celestial pills, and tossed them into the cave, all for the sake of playtime? Who would play around like you guys?’

Hu, right at this time, a strong suction surged from the cave mouth. Instantly, the pebbles in the surrounding area were all rolling towards the cave mouth.

That man immediately understood, and exclaimed, “As it turned out, there is also a Foreign Beast hidden here! Hahahaha, you guys have thrown the Celestial pills in to draw it out… That’s not right!”

To lure out a Foreign Beast, they should not have thrown the Celestial pills in. This did not make sense in terms of logic.

Could it be that they really were playing around?

“Hey, annoying guy, aren’t you leaving?” Hu Niu demanded impatiently.

“There is no one that can speak that way to me, Tu Jingtian!” The young man humphed, his expression filled with arrogance. He really could make no sense of the actions of Ling Han and his group, yet he was intrigued, and wanted to see what exactly was going on here.

“Then, I’ll beat you bastard up!” Hu Niu moved, and charged to attack Tu Jingtian.

As Tu Jingtian battled with Hu Niu, he released a battle cry.

The moment they exchanged blows, Tu Jingtian got the upper hand.

Hu Niu was indeed a monarch tier, but the battle prowess of a First Secret monarch tier was more or less equivalent to a Second Secret emperor tier, and Tu Jingtian was a Third Secret emperor tier[1]. This was an entire minor level, and there was at least a gap of 10 times their battle prowess.

Thankfully, Hu Niu still had a Source Power of heaven and earth, and Tu Jingtian also had his reservations, not daring to greatly expend his power of Regulation. Thus, though Hu Niu was at a disadvantage, she could still hold on for the moment. She would not be defeated soon.

Ling Han and the others were all unconcerned. If Hu Niu encountered danger, then whether it was Ling Han or the Rain Emperor that moved, they would both be able to easily resolve her dilemma.

Now, their attention was mostly concentrated on the underground.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?A while later, a total of eight people, seven men and one woman, flew over from various directions.

“Jingtian, why are you fighting with someone?” a beautiful woman asked. She seemed to be the leader of the group.

“Aunt Jin, I suspect they have discovered the lair of a beast, and are presently trying to lure it out,” Tu Jingtian said as he continued battling. He enjoyed the upper hand, so he was naturally completely calm.

“Beast lair?” The eight of them all looked towards the cave mouth, all bearing expressions of suspicion.

This cave mouth was too tiny, so what big guy could it be hiding?

The beautiful woman frowned, and seemed to be considering. However, after only a while, she declared, “All of you step down, this valley now belongs to our Tu Clan!”

These words were naturally directed at Ling Han and his group, her attitude high and haughty.

They had already been at Clear Heaven Pass for many days, so Ling Han naturally had some understanding of the forces that were here.

It could be said that there were frighteningly many Celestial Kings here.

In these several epochs, the majority of Celestial Kings had all come here and settled down. Some had had their descendants here, while others had taken disciples. In short, there were overwhelmingly large numbers of Celestial King Tier forces here. Ascending Origin Tiers didn’t even have the qualification to become the support of a force.

If it was the surname Tu… Right, there was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King with the surname of Tu, and these nine people should be the descendants of Celestial King Tu.

How could Ling Han possibly leave? To say nothing of the fact that these nine people were the descendants of only a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, even if they were descended from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, there would be no way that he would leave.

He stood, arms crossed behind his back, and asked smilingly, “What if we don’t leave?”

Tu Jin humphed, and commanded, “Clear the area.”

“Yes!” The seven people behind her all bowed and obeyed. Then, they leaped out, launching an offensive at Ling Han and the others.

Hong, long, long, right at this moment, the ground suddenly trembled harshly. Thankfully, everyone was all standing in mid-air, or they would definitely have stumbled and fallen over.

‘What’s going on?’

Tu Jin and the others were all astounded. They naturally would not be concerned about any ordinary earthquake, but this was a newly created heaven and earth. If a great commotion happened here, that would mean that the heaven and earth was still evolving.

This was the mighty power of world creation, and even a Celestial King was no match for that. How could they possibly be unafraid?

“That’s not right!” Tu Jin immediately calmed down. “It is not a massive change that has taken place in the heaven and earth, but a great beast that lies under the ground!”

She could already sense a powerful aura. At first, she was overjoyed because the stronger this aura was, the higher the cultivation level of the creature beneath it meant, and the more astonishing its value would be.

…Beast meat could replenish power of Regulation, and the Celestial medicine it nurtured could be at the Immortal Palace Tier, and had astonishing effects.

But very quickly, her expression of delighted surprise turned into fear because this aura was strong to the extent of abnormality.

“A-Ascending Origin Tier!” Even her voice was trembling.

At present, this heaven and earth did not allow Ascending Origin Tier elites to step in at all, yet now a great Ascending Origin Tier creature had actually emerged here. What did that mean?

As long as this great beast wished it, all of them would have to die!

How could this not be frightening?
