Chapter 2563: Arrival of Lu Li

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han felt slightly annoyed. He had actually been referred to as a “pretty boy”!

However, this couldn’t be helped. He was disguised as Li Long right now, and Li Long was indeed a pretty boy. He was incredibly handsome, to the point that he could almost be called beautiful. In fact, he was even more “beautiful” than many women.

In his annoyance, Ling Han clenched his fists even tighter. He then unleashed a punch.

Right now, he had already forged ahead on his own path. His Intent Realm had reached perfection, and his physique had more so reached the Sixth Heaven. Thus, this punch carried a boundless might that was almost no weaker than Celestial Tools.

However, Ebony naturally didn’t know this. Upon seeing Ling Han dare to face his Demonic Saw with bare fists alone, he involuntarily sneered.

This brat thought that he could underestimate the Demonic Saw just because it wasn’t a Celestial Tool?

Humph! Only he knew that a small amount of Divine Metal had been added to the Demonic Saw during its forging process. Thus, it was sharper and sturdier than most other Celestial King Tools.

What did it matter that Ling Han was a Celestial King? If he were struck by the Demonic Saw, he would definitely lose limbs. In fact, he would be sliced into two in an instant.

The spectators in the stands were also filled with anticipation and excitement. The battle had just begun, yet they could already witness blood and gore. They were naturally delighted. Even though the battle would conclude in an instant, all they wanted to see was blood and death.

“Utter fool!” Zhao Shuang jeered. His opponent knew that he had a weapon, yet he still chose to rush over head-on. Just how much did he want to die?

Tang Yuan was also astonished. He couldn’t believe that the World’s Paramount Martial Academy had actually produced such a foolish disciple.

He had placed a huge wager on Ling Han! If he lost… He wiped the cold sweat from his brows. Even if Ling Han were truly killed by Ebony, he would still whip his corpse for 10,000 years to vent his anger.

Yang Xiaoling snickered softly. As it turned out, this pretty boy was all looks and no brains. There would be no fun in toying with him.

As the spectators screamed and whistled, Ling Han’s fist collided with the teeth of the Demonic Saw.

If time were slowed down 10,000-fold, one would clearly see one tooth of the Demonic Saw shattering as it came into contact with Ling Han’s fist.

Because this saw was spinning, another tooth immediately whipped over. However, it was also shattered in an instant.

If time flowed a bit faster, they would hear an endless stream of crisp clanging sounds.

If time flowed as normal, however, everything would be over in a flash. Ling Han’s fist slammed over.

Peng!

The Demonic Saw was instantly snapped into two, with countless shards shooting into the sky. Some even shot back toward Ebony.

Pu, pu, pu!

His face, chest, and abdomen were all struck, instantly drawing blood.

“Aaah!!!” Ebony wailed in agony. This was a bone-piercing pain.

This punch stunned the entire stadium. There was a deathly silence, and only Ebony’s agonized wail continued to reverberate.

In the next instant, however, a tidal wave of cheers instantly erupted in the stadium. It was as if the spectators wanted to scream until their throats became sore.

Incredible! This was simply incredible! Obliterating the Demonic Saw with bare hands! How enthralling!

“Come on!” Tang Yuan screamed as he jumped up in excitement. Even though he had invited Ling Han, and even though he had high hopes for Ling Han, he had never actually seen Ling Han in action before. Thus, he hadn’t known much about his strength.

Now, however, he was clear. He was clear that he had underestimated Ling Han.

This brat… could definitely become a Blood Martial King. Moreover, he could even defeat Lu Li’s Blood Martial King, helping him win his face back!

Meanwhile, Zhao Shuang muttered in regret. Why hadn’t a subordinate of his father been on duty at that time? If that were the case, Ling Han would have become his subordinate and been fighting for him. He would have won countless benefits for him.

“What an interesting pretty boy,” Yang Xiaoling remarked as she licked her fiery red lips. There was intoxication in her eyes.

“Enough with the wailing!” Ling Han roared as he charged forward. He naturally wouldn’t feel any sympathy for someone like Ebony. Moreover, in a place such as the Celestial King Graveyard, sympathy would also be excessive. Few people deserved forgiveness.

He threw another punch.

Ebony hurriedly raised an arm to block, yet the shield of Regulations and Source Power on his arm was immediately shattered. His arm was crushed, sending a spray of blood into the air. His bones ripped through his skin, appearing as brutal as could be.

Peng!

Ling Han’s fists didn’t stop, striking Ebony’s ribs. The magnificent power of his punch reverberated, instantly causing Ebony’s body to explode into a cloud of blood and flesh.

In an uncanny twist, however, there was no shared grief from heaven and earth. There was no blood rain, either, and it was as if this place had been abandoned by heaven and earth.

The spectators faltered for a brief moment before erupting into a tidal wave of cheers.

They loved this kind of slaughter. Moreover, this had been an enrapturing punch that had completely obliterated the opponent.

However, some people were able to see more. They all observed Ling Han with a profound gaze.

To kill a Celestial King at the same cultivation level required immense strength. To obliterate their body with a single punch more so required astounding power. This was proof enough that Ling Han was more than just a monarch tier. He was very likely a monarch star.

Here, Celestial Kings were countless in number. Monarch tiers were common, yet monarch stars were much fewer in number.

“Delightful! Very well!” Tang Yuan roared as he jumped up again. He continued to clap, reflecting his immense joy.

Not only had he obtained a powerful warrior through this battle, but he had even won a huge sum of money. This double victory naturally filled him with euphoria.

“Tang Yuan, you’ve truly struck dumb luck.” Zhao Shuang couldn’t help but comment. He was feeling incredibly jealous.

Tang Yuan wore a smug expression. To second-generation young masters like him, owning a powerful Blood Martial King would win them a lot of face.

“After he wins a few more battles, I’ll wait for him to serve me in my bed chamber,” Yang Xiaoling said as she stood up. With a sway of her hips, she left the stadium of death.

‘Seductress!’ Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang said in their minds. They lusted for this seductive woman, yet they were filled with fear and apprehension at the same time. Even if she were served naked on a platter before them, they still wouldn’t dare to touch her.

The price to pay would be far too great.

“Our victor, Li Long!” the commentator shouted, announcing the winner. Even though this seemed a bit extra, how could a corpse achieve victory?

Ling Han exited the arena amid boisterous cheers from the audience. He returned to the resting area.

After a short while, he saw Tang Yuan running over.

“Haha, good job! Very good job!” Tang Yuan praised. “Come, come, come, I’ve already prepared a feast to celebrate your victory!”

Sure enough, after returning to the courtyard, Tang Yuan had already ordered people to prepare a feast. Moreover, he had invited many guests.

These guests all belonged to the Tang Clan’s faction, like Luo Yang and so on. Their parents were all subordinates of Tang Mingbo, and they were all followers of Tang Yuan. Many people had been invited, and there were also some female Celestial Kings.

The female Celestial Kings were all extremely bold, and they continued to make eyes at Ling Han. It was as if they didn’t mind participating in a wild adventure with this powerful man. Of course, this would be an adventure with no weapons and death.

Ling Han pretended not to notice them. He hadn’t come here to muck around with women.

“Young Master Tang, Lu Li has come.” As the feast progressed, a servant suddenly walked over to report this to Tang Yuan.

Everyone instantly fell silent. Silent suspense hung over the courtyard.

Lu Li was Tang Yuan’s mortal enemy. The two powerful young masters had continued to exchange blows, with both achieving some victories and suffering some defeats. The animosity between them only grew greater and greater.

“Why’s he come?” Tang Yuan said with a sneer. However, he immediately waved his hand, and said, “Let him enter. Does he think I’m afraid of him?!”
