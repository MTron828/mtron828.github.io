2778 A lesson

Ling Han didn’t invite the Empress. He just went out of the city with that person alone.

This Heavenly Venerate was called Depend Radiance, and he was much younger than Ling Han. After 100 billion years of cultivation, he had already advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. There was a hint of arrogance in his tone when he spoke.

The two walked for a while, until a great canyon appeared in front of them.

“According to the information that I have obtained, there are at least 100 monsters hidden here,” Depend Radiance said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He led the way and entered the canyon.

Ling Han also followed, but his sight blurred. Originally, though the environment here was indeed a bit eerie, it was definitely not as oppressive as it was at the moment. The sky seemed to be so low that he could reach out and touch it.

Depend Radiance had already disappeared.

What kind of place was this?

Ling Han knew that when two dimensions collided, it would give rise to extremely weird landforms and even fold space. For example, one would sometimes suddenly arrive at the fourth or fifth spatial level after walking through a cave on the second spatial level.

Was it the case here?

Ling Han walked ahead slowly. He didn’t dare to be careless. His current battle prowess should be able to allow him to rival or even outclass a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, but he would be no match for a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Hence, as the saying went, be careful, and you can live long.

However, after walking for a long time, Ling Han didn’t detect any danger.

From the outside, the canyon appeared to be small. Going by his pace, he would have walked around in it within a few breaths. However, he had already walked for at least an hour by now, and yet he still hadn’t seen the end.

Ling Han gave a wry smile. Depend Radiance wasn’t sincere indeed.

Ling Han simply sat down cross-legged, intending to see what Depend Radiance was up to. In any case, he could cultivate anywhere, and it was the same here.

One day, 10 days… a full two months had passed, and suddenly a sound was heard.

“Ling Han, do you want to come out?”

Ling Han opened his eyes. “Depend Radiance, did you trick me here just to ask me this question?”

“Hehe, we just thought that you are being too pompous, and wanted to keep you quiet for a while.” Another voice sounded, and it was definitely not Depend Radiance.

“Oh?” Ling Han smiled. “How have I been a hindrance to you?”

“Humph, this second spatial level was originally our Boss Yuan’s territory, but as soon as you came, you stole our boss’ limelight, so we hope that you will stay here for a while to cool your head off.”

Ling Han was astounded. Something like this would also cause him to attract animosity?

Hadn’t he been very low-key in the second spatial level? Whose limelight had he stolen?

However, as he thought about it again, he didn’t need to show off in the second spatial level, as he had already achieved outstanding battle merits on the first spatial level. Hence, he would be an influential figure no matter which spatial level he went to, and stealing someone else’s limelight was normal.

However, being able to rise above the others in the second spatial level would have meant that the person ought to be an incomparably outstanding character. Why did he not even have this bit of tolerance?

Was such a move privately done by these few people, or was it arranged by the “Boss Yuan”?

“You think this place can keep me trapped?” Ling Han said laughingly.

“This is actually a Mystery Realm formed by the collision of dimensions, and then we influenced the major forces of heaven and earth here. You will need at least 100,000,000 years before thinking of breaking out of it to escape!” someone declared confidently.

Light flashed through Ling Han’s eyes, and he nodded after sweeping a gaze around the place. The other party was right, the structure of the heaven and earth here was constantly changing, and to decipher a pattern behind the changes was extremely difficult. Hence, being trapped for more than 100,000,000 years was not an exaggeration.

But what these people didn’t know was that Ling Han’s power was far beyond the First Tier, so why would he need to act in accordance with the rules? He just needed to use his strength to break out of here.

This was the basis of his self-confidence, and that was why he had not snapped.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “Then I’ll show you by breaking out!”

He took large strides, and boom, power started gushing out from every cell in his body, transforming into a roaring river as the boundless Power of Dimension was surging, and continuously poured out of the body, forming a circle of light around him.

Ka, ka, ka, the space around Ling Han shattered continuously like a crystal being smashed to pieces.

Outside the valley, there were seven men and women altogether, and they stood there and smirked coldly.

They couldn’t stand the sight of Ling Han. He was merely a newcomer who had just been promoted from the first spatial level, but had the impertinence to cause such a big commotion, which affected the prestige of their boss.

Look how easily it was for them to lead him into a trap. That was how far his intelligence went?

“L-look…” someone suddenly said in a trembling manner, pointing at the valley, his face full of disbelief.

“Why are you panicking?” the others reprimanded him profusely. When they looked at the valley, they also became dumbfounded as Ling Han strode forward like walking on flat ground, not the slightest bit affected.

How was this possible?

Ling Han said smilingly, “When one’s power is strong to a certain extent, he is capable of breaking through all kinds of false illusions.”

Nonsense, they also knew this. However, the key point was that even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate would be adversely affected by the suppressive power of this place. Why were you able to use your strength to break out?

Ling Han looked at the seven young people, and said, “There is such a huge threat of Hysteria in front of you, and yet you are still having these ideas. Having such a small mind, I really don’t understand how you people became Heavenly Venerates.”

Those seven people felt humiliated and angry. Everyone was at the First Tier, so what right did Ling Han have to reprimand them as if he was their elder?

“Ling Han, don’t be too arrogant!” Depend Radiance immediately shouted.

Ling Han looked at him. “Do you think that I trusted you so easily because I have a low IQ?” He shook his head. “I said you have a small mind. Faced with the present condition of the heaven and earth, I am more willing to have a little more trust in people, but you have abused my trust.

“Today, I must teach you a good lesson.”

The group of seven, including Depend Radiance, sneered. “You are also just a First Tier Heavenly Venerate yourself. One against seven, do you have a chance of winning?”

Ling Han didn’t answer, but just strode forward.

“How dare you!!” The seven people roared angrily, and rushed towards Ling Han one after another.

When they rushed in front of Ling Han, their expressions changed drastically as they felt a terrifying suction force acting on their bodies, making them accelerate.

They wanted to stop, but they were shocked to find that it was impossible for them to do so.

Peng, peng, peng, peng, they crashed into each other instantly. So what if they were dignified Heavenly Venerates, they still collided into each other, looking like a complete mess. They were in such a miserable and embarrassed state.

...

They got up, and when they looked at Ling Han again, their gazes revealed extreme fear.

How strong was this person who made them suffer before he even made a single move?

“Run!” they exclaimed. They couldn’t possibly be Ling Han’s match; they had to ask “Boss Yuan” to step in to be able to match him.

“I said I was going to teach you a lesson, so why are you in a hurry to leave?” Ling Han stretched out his hand, and boom, a terrifying pressure descended on them. This was the power at the level of the Third Tier. It was impossible for these seven people to resist even if they had joined forces, and thus they were instantly suppressed one after another.

“Ah!” The seven people screamed miserably as they all fell to the ground, being unable to resist the pressure from Ling Han.

“Today I want to teach you some principles,” Ling Han said lightly. He sat cross-legged on one side, and yet the pressure was still there, causing the seven young Heavenly Venerates to sweat profusely.

“Comrades are not to be tricked!

“Trust is not something to be taken for granted!

“…”

With every sentence that Ling Han said, he pressed down once with his hand, causing the seven people to suffer excessively. No matter how much they fought against it with all their strength, it was useless, and they felt like all the bones in their bodies were about to break.
