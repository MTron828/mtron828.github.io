When elites fought, a difference of one millimeter was the difference between life and death!

The turn of events was mainly due to Ling Han’s strength being far above that of the old man from the Luo Clan. As a result, the effects were obvious when he activated the power of his divine patterns of gravity. If it weren’t for his superior strength, the results definitely wouldn’t have been so stark.

As the saying went, enough power would defeat a myriad of techniques. When one’s power reached a certain level, all kinds of techniques would become meaningless.

Ling Han’s power wasn’t that impressive yet, but it was still more than enough to affect the movements of the old man from the Luo Clan.

“Detestable brat!” The old man had already been cut several times, and he appeared extremely disheveled as his head of white hair billowed in the air. “You’ve offended the Luo Clan, and you’ll definitely die a horrid death! Not only you, but even your parents will be slaughtered. Your women will become playthings, and your descendants will be slaves for all eternity!

“The Luo Clan has existed for millions of years, and it’s not a force that a bastard from a small world can sway or challenge!”

Ling Han’s expression instantly became cold. “What a toxic tongue!”

He unleashed his 10,000 Techniques Return to One, and a Sword Ray instantly transformed into a thick streak that slashed toward the old man.

When he was in the Shattering Void Tier, he still needed to condense his Origin Power for a short moment before being able to unleash the 10,000 Techniques Return to One. Now, however, he could use it at will. What did this mean? This meant that the 10,000 Techniques Return to One already didn’t consume much of his Origin Power. Thus, he could unleash it as he desired.

At the same time, this also meant that the power of this technique was relatively weaker. There was no helping it, however, as this was only a sword technique of the Sun Moon Tier. How powerful could it be?

Anyhow, the might of this strike was still impressive, and it raised Ling Han’s battle prowess to the level of five stars.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The old man’s expression changed drastically after being struck numerous times. “Y-you’re a five-star genius!” he stammered in astonishment.

He was a sub-minor level above Ling Han, and was also a four-star genius himself. However, he was only evenly matched—perhaps even at a slight disadvantage—when facing Ling Han right now. Thus, there was only one explanation. That was... his opponent was a five-star genius!

This was far too frightening. Even the Left and Right Ministers, as well as the Seven Generals, were only four-star geniuses. Only the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire had reached the legendary level of five stars. This kind of enemy... He definitely had to annihilate him in the cradle. Otherwise, the Luo Clan would be condemned to eternal damnation!

“Five stars?” Ling Han scoffed. He didn’t unleash the Ultimate Arrow of the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow to frighten the old man, or else it was even possible that he would faint in terror.

However, secret techniques were all restricted by tiers. For example, the Three Styles of Black Origin that he was using now could raise his battle prowess by one star. When he reached the Heavenly Body Tier, though, the might of this technique would certainly fall dramatically, and definitely not have the same effects as now.

Thus, only power was eternal, and only power was hard power.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. It had been a wise decision to break through only after raising his power to 20 Stars of the Shattering Void Tier.

He continued to harass the old man with his divine patterns of gravity, causing him to trip and stumble all over the place. As a result, the battle prowess of the old man took a huge hit.

Raising one’s battle prowess wasn’t the only way to defeat enemies. Weakening the enemies was also a good tactic. For example, hadn’t the four people from the Luo Clan been planning on weakening the Lava Beast King with the Crimson Ground Locking Net? They wanted to drag their opponent’s battle prowess down to the same level as them, and then use their abundant experience to defeat them.

However, they were unaware that the Lava Beast King had already reached the consummate level. Even with the Crimson Ground Locking Net, it was still more likely that they would be defeated.

The old man from the Luo Clan received more and more wounds under Ling Han’s relentless attacks. Eventually, Ling Han’s sword pierced through his heart.

He grabbed the blade of the sword as hatred seeped from his eyes. “Hahahaha! Being a five-star genius is not necessarily a good thing. If others learn of this, countless people will target and try to kill you. I’ll wait for you in the netherworld!”

He drew his last breath after uttering this threat.

Ling Han lightly shook his sword and placed it back into the Black Tower. “There’s no need for you to worry,” he said softly. “When I’m strong enough, I’ll obliterate the Luo Clan first and let them accompany you!”

He retrieved the Spatial Spirit Tools of the four Luo Clan members. There were several hundred True Origin Stones as well as an ordinary Mountain River Stone inside. He shook his head in disappointment. He himself already had 10 special attribute Mountain River Stones.

He started refining the Crimson Ground Locking Net after returning to the depths of the cave. It was a decent item that could weaken the enemy’s cultivation level by quite a significant amount. The only uncertainty was the limit of its abilities. Would it work against elites of the Sun Moon Tier?

‘With this, I can easily suppress even great elites of the high extreme.’

Ling Han turned his attention to the pitch-black boulder. This boulder stuck out like a sore thumb in this environment, so it naturally attracted his attention. Moreover, why did the Lava Beast King lie on top of it? Why did Mountain River Stones appear on top of it?

He tried to lift the stone, but was unable to.

‘Is it fused to the ground, or does it have an astonishing weight?’

Ling Han tired to wrap his divine sense around the boulder. As long as this succeeded, he would be able to bring the boulder into his Black Tower regardless of how much it weighed.

The environment here was harsh, though Ling Han’s physique was completely unaffected by it. However, his divine sense hadn’t reached such a powerful level yet, and he instantly fell a sharp pain when it came into contact with the scorching lava in the depths underground. He immediately felt like retracting his divine sense.

However, Ling Han forcefully suppressed this urge, and continued to expand his divine sense.

His divine sense spread out bit by bit. After 30 minutes, a smile finally spread across his face.

Weng!

The pitch-black boulder instantly vanished.

He peered over, and found that a 21-meter deep crater had already appeared in the ground. There was a swirl of black at the bottom—it was unclear whether it was water, metal, or something else entirely. What was clear was that it was frighteningly profound.

Ling Han tossed a rock into the crater.

Pa!

The rock instantly exploded into smithereens.

Ling Han was stunned. One had to realize that the composition of the mountains and rocks here was relatively stable. At least, he could only create some sparks when he struck them with his full strength. Now, however, the rock had exploded on impact.

‘Its destructive power is terrifying.’

Weng!

An astonishing sight suddenly appeared at this moment—a human face floated up from under the black surface, yet the black surface appeared to possess startling flexibility. It continued to stretch further and further, yet it didn’t break no matter how far it stretched.

Although the face appeared normal in every aspect—it had a nose, a mouth, and eyes—it was... far too large!

How large was the black boulder from before?

This face was only a tiny bit smaller than it. It was larger than a manhole cover, and it was hard to fathom just how astonishing the true size of this person’s body was.

Even though they were separated by a layer of something, Ling Han could still sense the formidable aura that face was exuding. This feeling almost caused his soul to tremble.

‘So powerful!

‘This person has definitely surpassed the Sun Moon Tier, and perhaps even the Heavenly Body Tier!’ Ling Han suddenly came to a realization. That black boulder wasn’t placed here merely for its looks. Rather, it was placed here to suppress this cage or passageway.

After pushing up around nine meters or so, the face finally reached its limit, and was unable to advance any further. The face smiled and started to speak. However, no sound traveled out.

After a short moment, however, a voice suddenly sounded in Ling Han’s mind. “Lowly human, help me open this passageway, and I’ll grant you a life of glory!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Is this how you ask for help?”
