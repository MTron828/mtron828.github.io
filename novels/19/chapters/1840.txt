Chapter 1841: Surrounded

The large black dog left, with his demeanor as carefree as could be.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh as he watched him disappearing into the distance. With his return to the world, heavens knew how many people would suffer at his debauched hands. Ling Han silently prayed for these victims.

He then exchanged a smile with the Empress before walking away from where they had sat for almost a decade.

“My Divine Fetus has become more powerful,” the Empress said. After being tempered by the flames of the Celestial King, her Divine Fetus had ascended to a new height. Even though she was still limited to summoning nine doppelgangers, each one of them would be several times more powerful than before.

Moreover, even though her Divine Fetus hadn’t transitioned into one of the flame element, it had still received many benefits from the flame element. It had now become extremely amiable with flames, and she could more easily and quickly manipulate the fire particles that existed among heaven and earth.

Celestials were powerful because they could wield Regulations and directly use the great dao to crush others. Thus, Genesis Tier cultivators would be crushed by Severing Mundane Tier cultivators regardless of how many heavenly bodies they cultivated.

Regulations were superior and transcendent to power.

However, Regulations also needed to be manipulated, and there was a process of transforming them into usable battle prowess. The more affinity one had with the great dao, the quicker they would be able to summon Regulations. It was entirely possible that two cultivators were just as powerful as each other, yet one of them managed to instantly defeat the other because they were able to summon Regulations more quickly.

It was because of this that the large black dog had previously said that Ling Han could only rank among the lower quartile when compared to other genuine prodigies of Celestial King Tier forces. He hadn’t been deflating Ling Han on purpose.

Right now, the Empress could easily and quickly wield Regulations of the fire element. Compared to those at the same cultivation level, her speed was many times quicker. At the same time, the might of her Regulations was also significantly greater.

“How about you?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han smiled in reply.

Boom!

Bursts of flames erupted from his body, completely transforming him into a ball of flames. “I’ve obtained a fire element Divine Fetus, and apart from developing a strong affinity with fire element Regulations, I can also fuse together with the Great Dao of Fire. I can temporarily draw on its power to do battle.”

Generally speaking, Divine Fetuses were all like this. They would allow their owners to develop a stronger affinity with Regulations, and they would also allow their owners to manipulate Regulations that exceeded their cultivation level. However, this definitely couldn’t last for long. Sometimes, one would even need to pay a huge price for this power.

“What level can your most powerful strike reach now?” the Empress asked in curiosity.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before answering, “Even if Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng revive, I can dispose of them with a single strike.” Of course, this was after he fused together with the Great Dao of Fire and borrowed its power.

The Empress smiled upon hearing this. The more powerful Ling Han was, the happier she would naturally become.

At this moment, Ling Han also understood that the large black dog hadn’t been lying to him. There existed supreme prodigies who were far more powerful than him in the Celestial Realm.

To say nothing else, just the difference between two cultivators’ affinity with Regulations was enough to separate their battle prowess by heaven knew how much.

The built-up potential of seventh heaven, eighth heaven, and ninth heaven Celestial Kings was unfathomably astonishing. After accumulating for countless epochs, they all possessed innumerable treasures and inheritances. As such, they could easily nurture supremely powerful prodigies.

“Then let’s test our power out!” Ling Han said with vigor. Coming from a small world, he had defeated and trampled an exorbitant number of prodigies. This wouldn’t change any time soon.

The Empress was also brimming with confidence. She had already possessed a Divine Fetus before this, and it had now become even more powerful. As such, she could now rival genuine supreme prodigies.

Anyhow, there was no mountain for them to descend now, and they quickly returned to the canyon. However, the people here had already left. Right now, the canyon was completely deserted.

Although the chaotic aura had already vanished from the mystery realm, no one else was clear about what had happened. Moreover, the time limit of 10 years was almost up, so they naturally started to leave the mystery realm. After all, who dared to risk their life?

Ling Han and the Empress didn’t stay in the canyon, either. Instead, they continued to head toward the entrance of the mystery realm.

They were extremely quick, and it only took them a few days to catch up to the last group of leaving cultivators. They then caught up to the second-last group, the third-last group... When they finally exited the mystery realm, they had passed almost half of all the remaining cultivators.

Right now, the entrance of the mystery realm was bustling with activity. Some people were delighted, while some people were solemn. Those who were delighted were naturally overjoyed that their clan members had successfully exited the mystery realm and brought with them a large number of Blood Dragon Stones. Meanwhile, those who were feeling solemn were worried because their clan members still hadn’t exited the mystery realm yet. They were worried that they had died.

“Something incredible has happened!” someone suddenly shouted. “A supremely vicious person entered the mystery realm this time, and they killed several Holy Sons and Holy Daughters!”

“That’s right! Qianzhao Tian, Bei Xuanming, Beiyu Xiong, and some others were all killed by this vicious person!”

“That vicious person is called Ling Han!”

It wasn’t long before news of Ling Han’s “great feats” spread far and wide, with all of the forces learning of his actions. For example, the Qianzhao Clan and the Lunar Sect. Although they were slightly doubtful that their Holy Sons or successors had been killed by Ling Han, the fact that everyone was repeating the same thing and the fact that Qianzhao Tian and Bei Xuanming still hadn’t exited the mystery realm yet forced them to slowly accept this reality.

When Ling Han and the Empress exited the mystery realm, a devastating aura instantly washed over them. At least 100 elites appeared before them and blocked their path.

“Did you kill Qianzhao Tian?”

“Did you kill Beiyu Xiong?”

“Did you kill...”

These were all Dividing Soul Tier elites, and at this moment, they were all brimming with a murderous aura. They were radiating with a formidable aura that would cause even Severing Mundane Tier grand elders to tremble in fear. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han smiled calmly, and replied, “Probably. I don’t have the time and effort to remember the name of some trash.”

‘You’re... far too arrogant!’

The Dividing Soul Tier elites were enraged. A measly cultivator at the peak stage of the third severance actually dared to act so audaciously before them? Which of them couldn’t raise their hand and easily kill Ling Han 100 times over?

“Foolish junior, since you’ve admitted your crimes, it’s time for you to die!” a Dividing Soul Tier elite from the Qianzhao Clan said coldly. He was called Qianzhao Yu, and in three-star forces, Dividing Soul Tier elites could be considered as absolutely mighty figures. Thus, his demeanor was naturally high and mighty.

Right now, he was burning with fury. Ling Han had actually dared to kill a successor of the Qianzhao Clan! This was blatant provocation toward the Qianzhao Clan!

He was a measly third severance cultivator, so how did he dare to do this?

Qianzhao Yu still wasn’t aware that Qianzhao Yang had also died at the hands of Ling Han. Otherwise, he would have definitely exploded in rage.

Raising a potential successor was no easy task. It required a huge amount of time and resources. Thus, losing two potential successors at once was a huge blow to the Qianzhao Clan.

“I’ll deal with him!” an elite of the Beiyu Clan roared and stepped forward. He was also seething with rage.

“No, I’ll deal with him!” another person shouted. The Dividing Soul Tier elites were all itching to kill Ling Han.

“Wait!”

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly dashed over, and they radiated with a paramount aura that seemed as if it could suppress the heavens. Even the Dividing Soul Tier elites couldn’t help but retreat.

Immortal Palace Tier!

“Lord Fu Yan!” the Dividing Soul Tier elites greeted in respect.

Regardless of where they were, Immortal Palace Tier cultivators could always be referred to as elites. They would enjoy a high status even in Celestial King Tier forces.

This Immortal Palace Tier elite was none other than Fu Yan, and he had come here at the direction of Fu Shenbing. His task was to ensure Ling Han’s safety. Of course, the elites from the Roc Palace had also come to ensure Ling Han’s safety. However, Fu Yan had still chosen to step forward first. This was naturally to butter up to the Roc Palace.

That was a Celestial King Tier force, so was it not freakish and impressive?

Fu Yan was brimming with might and dignity. Although he was stepping forward to butter up to the Roc Palace, he still possessed a sense of superiority before the Dividing Soul Tier elites. He raised his hand slightly, signifying to the others that they didn’t need to pay respects. There was an air of arrogance and haughtiness about him.

“Dare I ask, Lord Fu Yan, why are you stopping us?” the Dividing Soul Tier elites asked. Although they were weaker than Fu Yan, the forces behind them weren’t weaker than the Fu Clan. Thus, they didn’t need to cower.

In any case, the battleships of their forces were also hovering in the sky. These could completely be treated as Immortal Palace Tier elites!
