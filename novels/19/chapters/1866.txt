Chapter 1867: The tragic Cheng Fengyun

Water and fire were completely incompatible.

Although water overcame fire among the Five Elements, this was not an absolutely restrictive relation. Instead, both were the weakness of the other.

While water did overcome fire, fire could also overcome water, and it would depend on which was the stronger.

Yi Tianhe was very extraordinary. He was not a Divine Fetus, but possessed a little battle prowess ability which allowed him to unleash battle prowess that was inferior only to Divine Fetus. This was also why he was even stronger than Tang Feng.

Unfortunately, Ling Han presently was a true Divine Fetus. Moreover, Nine Heavens Flame was stronger than a Divine Fetus!

...Divine Fetus could only draw on some Celestial King Tier-level power, but Nine Heavens Flame was a Celestial King Tier-level existence itself, and was naturally even stronger than a Divine Fetus.

Ling Han did not even have to use the Nine Heavens Flame. He only had to release his power of Divine Fetus, and the flames took the form of multiple seals, rising in resistance against the Water Element great dao.

If it was a real clash of the two great dao of Water and Fire, there would actually be no difference in power. After advancing to Celestial King Tier, Regulations did not differ in strength. However, both Ling Han and Yi Tianhe were only in the Severing Mundane Tier, so the gap was still huge.

As the flames blazed fiercely, steam rose, and then there was no longer any river that soared skywards.

Visibly, this Divine River was drying up, as if it had encountered a great drought that would happen “once in a century”. In an instant, it had completely evaporated.

Yi Tianhe’s appearance had also changed greatly. At first, he looked elegant and handsome, yet now he was all skin and bones, as if all the liquid in his body had been evaporated as well. He was not much different from a dried corpse.

On the spectators’ seats, everyone was speechless.

Who would have imagined that what should have been a fierce battle would actually end so quickly.

Yesterday, Ling Han had defeated Tang Feng with a single move. And today? He had similarly defeated Yi Tianhe with a single move. To say nothing of the fact that no one had defeated Ling Han, even the question of exactly how strong he was could not be guessed at.

Hiss, just who exactly was this Ling Han?

Cheng Fengyun’s face muscles twitched. Though the battle had yet to be decided, he already knew that he had lost.

‘F*ck!’

He was cursing in his heart. How could there be someone so strong? Or rather, how could such a strong person possibly appear in the first level? If you were the heir of a Celestial King Tier-level sect, then an exception would have been made for you, and you would have been led to the fourth level no matter what.

‘Have you deliberately come to cause me trouble?’

“I admit defeat!” Yi Tianhe declared in a trembling voice. If he did not forfeit now, the seals of great dao in his body would be burnt by the Divine Flames, and his cultivation level would retreat 1,000 miles.

Ling Han released his grip, and took a few steps back. Smiling, he said, “You let me win.”

Yi Tianhe’s figure shook. The Source Power flickered slightly, and his body immediately filled out. In the first place, he had not sustained any major injuries. As long as his life force was not damaged, it would not have much effect on a cultivator.

He regained his handsome appearance, and cast a deep look on Ling Han. Then, he said, “Brother Ling, let me first wish you that you will be invincible and gain the final victory. However, I heard that Zhao Qingfeng has come. This person... I have seen him move in an ancient site before. He is indescribably strong. I only managed to escape out of luck.”

Zhao Qingfeng again!

It was already not Ling Han’s first time hearing this name. Previously, it was only from an investigator who had not even entered the Severing Mundane Tier. He could think that it was the latter who was simply amazed because of his lack of experience, but Yi Tianhe was a king tier, and even he was so wary, which showed that Zhao Qingfeng was indeed extraordinarily strong.

“I will take note.” He smiled.

“No, Brother Ling!” Yi Tianhe said seriously. “Zhao Qingfeng’s strength has exceeded the range of emperor tier. I estimate that even if he hasn’t advanced into the monarch tier, he would not be too far off, either.”

Only now did Ling Han seriously take this matter to heart. Monarch tier!

However, without advancing into the fifth severance, no matter how strong the prodigy was, he would not be qualified to be called a monarch tier. He could only be considered an excellent figure among emperor tiers. For example, like Ling Han. Only if he had succeeded in the fifth severance could he have the right to call himself a monarch tier.

He did not believe that Zhao Qingfeng had achieved the fifth severance. Otherwise, there would be no need for him to even fight. He should just directly admit defeat. The gap between fourth severance and fifth severance was like the gap between the Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier. That was a qualitative difference.

“Furthermore, Zhao Qingfeng’s favorite hobby is killing prodigies.” Yi Tianhe grimaced, and said, “I did not die, not because Zhao Qingfeng has become kind, but rather because he does not even deign to kill those who are mediocre.”

In Zhao Qingfeng’s eyes, king tiers were actually just mediocre!

Ling Han nodded, and said, “All right, I will keep that in mind.”

Yi Tianhe also nodded, turned, and left. His figure was a little despondent. After all, in a battle of equals, and a battle between a fourth severance and a third severance at that, he had lost completely. This had seriously struck a blow on his pride.

On the spectators’ seats, Cheng Fengyun’s expression was livid. At this moment, he really wanted to rush down and beat Yi Tianhe up.

‘You f****** call yourself a king tier?’

Rubbish, absolute nonsense!

“Slap then,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said calmly.

When it came to gambling, Cheng Fengyun’s character was quite fair. He gritted his teeth, and began to deliver slaps on his own face.

***

This battle naturally caused Ling Han’s rising reputation to become even louder, and also drew even more forces to recruit him, but just like yesterday, Ling Han did not bother to give them any regard.

On the fourth day, the fifth day, Ling Han had encountered king tiers. The participants were becoming fewer and fewer, and the chances for encountering elites were naturally higher and higher, but encountering Ling Han was actually the greatest misfortune for the other contestants.

He progressed triumphantly, and charged all the way to the top 16.

He only had to win another two rounds, and he would be able to advance into the fourth level, and fight in the final rounds.

On the ninth day, Ling Han’s opponent was... Bewitching Maiden Rou!

“In this battle, Ling Han will definitely lose!” Cheng Fengyun who had been silent for a few days became lively again. In the last few days, he had kept his silence. Even if others asked him to provide a commentary, he would only laugh drily.

He was not an idiot. Even Tang Feng and Yi Tianhe were no match for Ling Han. If he continued to insist, that would really be asking for punishment.

But this time was different. That was because Ling Han’s opponent was Bewitching Maiden Rou.

“Fairy Rou is the Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect, and not only is she as beautiful as a celestial maiden, and as alluring as a peach, she has also cultivated the techniques of the Purity Sect. To say nothing of men, even women would not be able to resist a slight smile from her!”

Cheng Fengyun regained the confidence that he had had at the beginning, and passed his judgement. He had never been one to fear suffering. “And for men, the charm techniques of the Purity Sect naturally have even more powerful destructive ability. Faced against one known as the greatest prodigy that would never appear in millions and millions of years in the Purity Sect, how could Ling Han win?”

Everyone in the area did not make a sound, and silently watched as he chattered on and on. After a good while, someone asked, “Why don’t we have another gamble?”

This time, Cheng Fengyun’s self-confidence was really off the charts. He took the initiative to say, “If Ling Han can still win, I will dance naked here!”

To even say such words, it showed how certain he was of his win.

The heavier the bet, the more proof it was of his confidence, and the smoother this comeback of his would be.

“All right, Young Master Cheng is indeed heroic!” A good few people cheered. Whether it was really praise for Cheng Fengyun was unknown, though.

In the arena.

Bewitching Maiden Rou walked delicately over, her pretty face still as beautiful as a celestial maiden’s, exuding a seduction that would bewitch the soul. As her slender waist swayed, her hips pulled, causing anyone’s heart to melt.

However, her brows were wrinkled in a frown, and she sighed softly, and said, “Why have I encountered a monster like you! Two rounds later at least would have been better!”

She was really depressed. ‘Haven’t you gone off to the Roc Palace? Why have you come to contest for the Dao Regulating Pill here then?’

“I forfeit!” She directly gave up without even a fight.

Cheng Fengyun instantly spluttered, a colorful expression on his face.

F***!
