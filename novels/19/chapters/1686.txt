Chapter 1687: What is Severing Mundane Tier?

‘You are very extraordinary.’

This was not a compliment from just anyone, but the assessment of a third severance elite!

Ling Han was neither haughty nor humble, and said, “Senior is flattering me.”

Mao Dai smiled, and replied, “There is no need to be modest. Being overly modest is equivalent to being proud.”

Ling Han smiled as well, and responded, “This junior is indeed very extraordinary. I have not encountered anyone that can match me among my peers yet.”

Mao Dai couldn’t help but be surprised, then laughed loudly, and said, “Hahaha, you are quite interesting, very interesting.” He paused, and then continued, “So far, there was only one youth who could speak so frankly and with such confidence before me.”

“That is because Senior is amiable, so this junior dares to be frank,” Ling Han said.

Mao Dai extended a finger to tap at Ling Han. “This flattery is quite good, it is pleasing to me.” He walked, his arms still crossed behind him, and said, “Come and walk with me.”

Ling Han set out behind him. Naturally, it was impossible that he would walk side by side with Mao Dai. Instead, he followed a small step behind him.

“You only broke through to the Genesis Tier after reaching 10,000,000 stars, right?” Mao Dai asked suddenly.

Ling Han hesitated slightly, and replied, “Yes.”

Mao Dai had already shown him benevolence; furthermore, it was very unwise to play any kind of tricks in such an elite.

Mao Dai’s figure paused slightly, and then immediately went back to normal. He said, “I never thought that I, Mao Dai, would have been able to meet a prodigy that had genuinely cultivated to the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier. Young man, I take back my previous assessment. You are not very extraordinary, but rather extremely extraordinary!”

This assessment was really very high, extraordinary and outstanding. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Han only smiled in response. Since Mao Dai already told him not to be modest, he would not be reserved. He was indeed very awesome. In a battle of equals, only the male and female Saints that had come out of major sects could be a match for him—the kind like Hu Niu.

“Young man, do you know what is Severing Mundane?” Mao Dai suddenly changed the topic.

Severing Mundane? Wasn’t it severing one’s mortal bonds?

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then said, “That is dealing a strike to oneself, to sever one’s most precious and valuable relations.”

Mao Dai nodded, and then continued, “Heavenly Dao is cold and merciless. If one wants to attain immortality, one must pay a price. In the past, what I most valued was my wife and daughter, but after dealing three strikes to myself, no matter how earnestly I try to remember now, I cannot regain those previous emotions that I had once held towards my wife and daughter.”

This was sorrowful. It was clear that his love had once been so deep, but now he could not even remember that previous emotion that he had once felt, because he had already severed this relation himself, and nothing was left of it.

Now, Ling Han could slightly understand why Jiang Wushang would rather give up any hope of achieving revenge than to break through to the Severing Mundane Tier. That was because from a certain aspect, after severing the mundane, he would no longer be who he had once been.

“This is my eternal regret, and I will never be able to compensate for it.” Mao Dai sighed, then turned to look at Ling Han, and said, “Young man, is there anything that you value and are unwilling to part with?”

“Yes!” Ling Han nodded without hesitation.

There had to be some other way that he could sever some relations that he did not value that much with this strike.

Mao Dai looked at Ling Han, and then slowly said, “Some people do not wish to sever what they value the most, and deliberately did some tricks to their memory, turning themselves into another person, and fall in love with another, wanting to use this relation as replacement when they step into the Severing Mundane Tier.

“However, in front of the Dao of Heaven and Earth, cultivators have to face their true selves. No matter what kind of schemes you resort to, it is all pointless effort.

“To break through to the Severing Mundane Tier, it is necessary to sever the mortal bond that binds you the most.”

Ling Han’s figure involuntarily trembled. There were too many people that he valued, and all of them were memories that he was unwilling to sever.

Mao Dai saw Ling Han’s expression become grim, smiled, and said, “Mortals all think that the Severing Mundane Tier means dealing a blow to oneself, yet do not know that there is another path of Severing Mundane that the blow is not dealt to himself.”

Ling Han immediately became excited, and said, “Senior, please guide me!”

He bowed fully. If there was a way for him to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier without striking himself, then these words from Mao Dai today would be more valuable than a Celestial King technique.

Mao Dai smiled gladly, and said, “Striking oneself is only a minor Dao, and the true path of strength would be... striking the heaven and earth!”

Striking heaven and earth!

Ling Han’s mouth gaped slightly. Severing Mundane meant severing one’s mortal bonds, and merging with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, but if he turned around and struck heaven and earth, how was he going to merge with the Dao of Heaven and Earth? It was more likely that he would be rejected.

Mao Dai explained, “Striking the heaven and earth, this was something that I saw in an ancient site. Years ago, there was a supreme prodigy that became a Severing Mundane Tier by striking the heaven and earth, and did not borrow any power from the heaven and earth. All he depended on was his own strength. I myself am the heaven, and I myself am the earth, and what I say is fact!”

Hearing the last few words, Ling Han couldn’t help but feel fired up. This was the path of strength that he had been pursuing all this while.

“But striking oneself is already very difficult, what more dealing a strike to the heaven and earth.” Mao Dai’s expression became serious. “Furthermore, dealing a strike to the heaven and earth means that you would definitely experience a backlash from the heaven and earth. Even if you successfully dealt out this strike, the chances of your death would be extremely high.”

Ling Han’s expression was determined, and he answered, “Senior, thank you for showing me the right path. I still feel that I can try out this alternative path.”

Mao Dai nodded, and said, “You are a true prodigy. I am unwilling to have you experience the same regrets that I have, and at the same time wish that you can surpass me and become stronger! Breaking through to the Genesis Tier at the pinnacle of Eternal River Tier, and becoming a Severing Mundane Tier, you would only be invincible among your peers at most.

“This so-called peers is referring to the first severance against the first severance, second severance against second severance. However, if you can advance into the Severing Mundane Tier on this basis, then you will be invincible even in a tier-surpassing battle!”

This was unimaginable. Having just advanced into the first severance, he would be able to kill even a peak stage second severance elite!

But just how many people were capable of this in the Celestial Realm?

Merely the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier had trapped who knew how many people, and added with the fact that one would have to strike the heaven and earth, even if he managed to successfully deal this strike, most people would not be able to survive the backlash from the heaven and earth.

Only a true king tier could accomplish this kind of glorious feat!

“As far as I know, there are a total of seven Mystery Realms that one can advance into the Severing Mundane Tier near Dark Moon City, and the Mortality Barrier Pool is the location that would open the soonest. It is also where the power of heaven and earth is strongest, and going by my calculations, it should be enough to support you to strike at the heaven and earth.

“However, the Mortality Barrier Pool will open two years later, and this bit of time is far from enough to allow you to reach the peak stage of Saint King Tier, and accumulate enough comprehension at the same time.

“And the next time the Mortality Barrier Pool opens would be 10,000,000 years later.”

Mao Dai shook his head, appearing to feel that it was a pity. To deal a strike to the heaven and earth would require a stronger power from the heaven and earth, and only the Mortality Barrier Pool suited their requirements, but this little bit of time was really not enough.

“However, after you reach the peak stage of Saint King TIer, you can travel around. The Celestial Realm is too big, and there must be a Mystery Realm for Severing Mundane Tier that can compare to the Mortality Barrier Pool.”

Ling Han thanked him again. This information might only have been nonsense to others; even if they knew that there was a way to avoid striking themselves, so what? It was impossible that they could manage to deal a strike to the heaven and earth. But for Ling Han, this was too valuable, and had resolved a huge problem that he had been constantly worrying about.

“Go on.” Mao Dai waved him off, and after a pause, he added, “If you have any kind of trouble, you can come look for me.”

It was clear how high an opinion he had of Ling Han from these words.

Ling Han bowed and thanked him. However, though Mao Dai had already said such, Ling Han was definitely not the type to come and trouble him at every sign of a problem. You really thought that he had nothing else to do?

This could only be used at the most crucial moment.
