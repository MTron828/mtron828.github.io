Chapter 656: Acting Separately

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Henyee

Both the Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing paled in shock before flying into thunderous rage.

This news was really too subversive; it could even be considered treasonous, actually daring to rebuke the five ancient great sects that sat upon the high pedestal. But, on the one hand, Ling Han was their brother, and on the other, Ling Han had also analyzed various illogical points one by one. Both proved that Ling Han’s words were not false.

The Heaven’s Sword Sect and the other five ancient great sects, they deserved to be killed for their evil intentions!

“Only if we split open the skies will we be able to fight back.” The Rain Emperor nodded. Mu Rong Qing nodded as well, his expression extremely serious. Although he was usually carefree and wilful, in the face of this kind of truth, he no longer smiled mischievously.

Ling Han was overjoyed, and exclaimed, “Big Brother, how about you become the emperor?” Rain Emperor had been the ruler of the Rain Country in the first place, and in terms of the power of the nation, his understanding had exceeded both Ling Han’s and Mu Rong Qing’s, and perhaps even Feng Po Yun’s.

The Rain Emperor thought for a moment, but then shook his head, and said, “I can’t! It’s not that I don’t want to take on such a heavy responsibility, but I can’t. Third Brother, power of the nation is not as simple as you think. There’s a saying that goes, what kind of stomach you have will determine how much you can eat. If it was to unite this whole realm and establish a single country, then the power of the nation of this level would be akin to an unprecedented Divine Herb. An ordinary person would only be incapable of taking such strong a medicine, and after consumption, would die as his body exploded from the strength of the medicine.”

“That’s right, Third Brother. Amongst us three brothers, your talent is the highest, so why don’t you be this emperor? Big Brother and I will be responsible for assisting you. Let us three brothers join forces, and conquer this whole realm first.” Mu Rong Qing laughed.

“If Third Brother is unwilling, Hu Niu would be fine too.” The Rain Emperor smiled. He knew that Ling Han was not the kind of person to care about power struggles, and pulled Hu Niu in to convince him.

Hu Niu happily took on the position, declaring, “Then you all have to call Niu ‘Milady Queen’ in the future!”

Ling Han merely grinned bitterly, and said, “If we let this little girl be an empress, the country would descend into total chaos on the second day.”

“Then it’ll be Third Brother.” The Rain Emperor nodded, his mind made up. He, too, was not one to be overly fond of power. Otherwise, with his talent and power, he would have had been qualified to break through to the Flower Blossom Tier in the Desolate North, and it would be a piece of cake for him to unite all the Nine Nations of the Desolate North under his rule.

Ling Han and his brothers began to talk about further details of establishing their own country and splitting open the skies.

Something like establishing a country was naturally a small matter to the Rain Emperor. He had been on the throne for many years, and the only difference was the size and the overall power level of the territory; what else was different?

Splitting the skies, though, was much more difficult.

If they wanted to bring the whole realm to ascend with them into the immortal realm, how powerful would they need to be?

It was a must to reach the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and besides that, they had to gather the combined power of the nation of an entire realm, which was a very terrifying thing. An ordinary person was naturally not much, but what about ten thousand, or a hundred million? Every person, via power of the nation, would contribute a portion to the person in charge of splitting open the skies. How powerful would this kind of power combined together be?

Moreover, there was no shortage of cultivators in the realm, and if they joined together, there were really not that many Shattering Void Tier cultivators that could take them on.

However, Ling Han was different.

He had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, and had also formed the Body of Diamond. His physical resilience was on par with that of precious metal of the same level, and when he reached the Shattering Void Tier, his physique would be on the level of Divine Metals.

If he could improve this physique of his to its maximum capacity, then how could it be that the amount of energy he gathered be unable to split open the skies?

By that time, Ling Han would be in a very strange condition. His cultivation level would only reach the peak of this realm, but his strength would have reached immortal level, and his battle prowess would far exceed even that.

To battle with the heavens, and to bring the whole realm and ascend.

The more they talked, the more excited the three brothers became. This was a grand move. If they succeeded, their names would be forever remembered, and they would become legends.

“From today onwards, we have to work even harder on our cultivation.”

“Let’s first enter into the Restore Heaven Academy, and rope in various prodigies. When the time comes, we will then establish our country, and have all these people gather under our banner!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Haha, to battle with the five ancient great sects; the mere thought of it is enough to make my blood boil with excitement, and my fighting spirit soar.”

Ling Han withdrew a great amount of valuable medicines and herbs for his two brothers. Firstly, they could use these resources for their own cultivation, and secondly, they could use these treasures to open the path for themselves and befriend various geniuses. After all, if one wanted to pull another into one’s camp, what else was there to do but to use both a carrot and a stick?

The five of them exited the Black Tower. The enrolment test for the Restore Heaven Academy was about to begin.

They did not go together. The Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing also went their separate ways. This test was their first step to bribe and rope in their fellow candidates, so they naturally had to act separately so as to expand their sphere of influence.

Hu Niu and Zhu Xuan Er were still with Ling Han. The three of them arrived outside the mountain gate of the Restore Heaven Academy. It was something that had just been built, and there was a powerful ultimate elite standing guard, with several young disciples that were placed in charge of reception on the sidelines.

These young disciples have all been transferred over form the five great sects, and they obviously wore expressions of pride. Even if they were unable to enter into the Restore Heaven Academy, they were still incredibly arrogant—were the names of the five ancient great sects not enough for them to be arrogant?

The first step was the measuring of bone age and cultivation level. Those that were unable to satisfy the lowest requirements would not be qualified to even attempt the first part of the test.

Zhu Xuan Er was up first. She stretched out her jade-like slender hand, causing that disciple who was in charge of measuring bone age to blush. The hand that was holding the golden needle kept shaking, and he was completely unable to pierce it into her skin.

This hand was really too beautiful, just as if it had been carefully carved by the gods. Every inch was close to perfection, and he couldn’t bear to pierce his needle into such a beautiful hand.

He made several failed attempts to pierce it with the needle, but, ultimately, he had no choice but have a female disciple come over, and only then was the test for measuring bone age completed.

“Twenty two years old,” this female disciple announced, an expression filled with shock appearing on her face.

A Flower Blossom Tier cultivator at twenty two years of age... she was an impressive prodigy, and could be ranked in the top fifty, no, the top thirty even in the five great sects. This was an extreme shock.

The ultimate elite standing on the side stroked his beard, appearing very happy.Looks like there was going to be a satisfactory sapling this time round again . He swept a glance at Zhu Xuan Er, and was slightly surprised. This girl had obviously disguised her appearance.

Still, changing one’s appearance would not be able to change one’s bone age. No one insisted that one had to come with their real face, and this did not break any of the rules.

The thought merely flashed through the mind of this ultimate elite, but he did not say anything much.

The next one was Hu Niu.

“Such a small little girl?” A few disciples could not believe their eyes. Some of them even laughed, and joked around. This was the Restore Heaven Academy enrolling disciples, not a game.

Now, everyone was lining up to undertake the test for bone age, and behind them, someone immediately called out, “Don’t mess around, hurry up and get out of the way!”

“Such a tiny little girl had better go home and drink her milk!”

“Big Brother has a sweet here, do you want to come over and suck—”

Peng!

A vulgar man was just about to say something filthy, yet it enraged Hu Niu. With a flash, her little figure had appeared in front of him, and thrown out a punch. As lightning crackled, she not only sent the man flying, but had even turned him into a corpse.

Zizizi , there was white-colored lightning twisting around the man’s body, making for a terrifying sight.

All of a sudden, utter silence fell.

Those that had come to take the test for bone age were either in the Flower Blossom or the Spiritual Infant Tier. How could there be anyone that wanted to bluff their way in? That vulgar man was well-known for having a taste for kids, but as he originated from a great clan, and he himself had also reached the Flower Blossom Tier, he was also looked highly upon. Thus, no one had stood up against him before now.

He was a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator, yet was directly killed in an instant. How could this not surprise the masses?

Hu Niu placed her hands on her hips, and then humphed, and said, “You dare to have rotten ideas about Niu, you really are seeking your own death!”
