2874 Might of the Ninth-Grade Seals

Ling Han was completely puzzled. Who the hell would know who this person was?

However, he didn’t show this on his face, and he replied, “Of course.”

He planned to fish more information from this person.

“Oh, then tell me what you know,” Meng Dong said, not falling for Ling Han’s trick. He smiled as he looked at Ling Han.

!!

‘F*ck! This person is fairly alert.’

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “How can I tell you such a big secret just like that? What if you’re trying to trick me?”

He continued to bluff.

“Hahaha!” Meng Dong roared with laughter before nodding, and saying, “This is indeed a big secret, one so big that it can even upheave the heavens! However, little brother, it looks like you still haven’t awakened yet! How strange! You’re already at the Second Tier, so why haven’t you awakened yet?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He wore a puzzled expression as he stroked his chin.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “Since you’re not willing to say, and since I’m extremely keen to know your secrets… I have no option but to capture you and make you speak.”

Meng Dong shook his head, saying, “Little brother, you’re still a little too weak to capture me.”

“Oh? Then why don’t I give it a try?” With a roar, Ling Han tossed aside the gigantic vein of ore that he had been holding before charging at Meng Dong.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them immediately started to attack each other, not holding back in the least. They both wanted to crush the other in the most dominant manner.

However, even though Ling Han’s cultivation had improved, Meng Dong’s cultivation had improved as well. He had already reached the Third Tier.

He was at the early stage of the Third Tier, and his power was already approaching the late stage and even peak stage of the Fourth Tier. However, it was unable to reach the Fifth Tier. This was because he wasn’t freakish enough, so he was unable to surpass two entire major tiers. Moreover, the jump from the Fourth Tier to the Fifth Tier was far too large.

Boom!

The two of them continued to clash, with neither of them being able to gain the upper hand.

“Little brother, your older brother isn’t going to go easy on you this time,” Meng Dong said with a loud laugh. A large dragon rose from his back, yet looking closely, this wasn’t genuinely a large dragon. Instead, it was a seal. After taking shape, it returned to Meng Dong’s body.

Weng!

The symbol lit up, causing his power to instantly rise by an explosive amount.

39 times, to be exact.

‘How impressive!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind. Apart from Meng Dong, he had never come across anyone else who could use a sixth-grade seal.

Meng Dong clearly wasn’t supported by anyone at the Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier, so where had he obtained such a high-level seal from?

Perhaps… he had concealed his background? Or perhaps he was like Ling Han? When he ascended, perhaps Heavenly Venerable Seals would automatically appear?

‘Forget about it; let me finish this fight first.’

Ling Han roared as he fought, activating the Four Directions Seals and also increasing his power 39-fold. The seal would materialize with each punch that he threw and charge furiously at Meng Dong.

“Hmph!” Meng Dong was fearless, and he brutally shattered the seal that was rushing at him with a single punch.

He was truly no inferior to Ling Han. He was far too powerful.

They both channeled their Heavenly Venerate Techniques, with Ling Han unleashing his Fists of Fury and Meng Dong… starting to spit out weapons again.

This technique was already ferocious to begin with, and the repulsive “spitting” action caused Ling Han to become incandescent with rage. His fists became wild and brutal as he channeled his Fists of Fury to the extreme.

Their battle was intense, yet they were still unable to determine a victor.

“Little brother, eat this strike!” Meng Dong bellowed. His bones started to glow, forming a fuzzy seal that radiated with a petrifying aura that could suppress the heavens.

Meng Dong’s power rose explosively at this instant, increasing at least 60-fold.

Ling Han faced this strike head-on.

Peng!

He was sent flying back.

“Little brother, this is a first-grade seal!” Meng Dong said calmly. His body was glowing with unlimited radiance, and an air of chaos was pulsating in his exhalations. He was like a paramount deity as he walked toward Ling Han.

The Empress and Hu Niu also heard this, and they couldn’t help but feel stunned. Even though Ling Han had unearthed so many Heavenly Venerable Seals, the most impressive of them had only been a sixth-grade seal that had multiplied his power over 30 times.

Where had Meng Dong obtained this first-grade seal from?

“Little brother, obediently surrender yourself. When your older brother awakens your slumbering memories, I might even consider gifting you this seal,” Meng Dong said with a chuckle.

If he were being honest, then he would truly be the most generous person in the entire world.

This was a first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal! Even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates would covet it, right?

Meng Dong would give it away just like that?

Ling Han regained his balance, saying, “If I need it, I’ll take it myself!”

“Little brother, I’ve discovered that you really like talking big,” Meng Dong said with a shake of his head. “Against your older brother, how many exchanges do you think you can withstand?”

He charged over with vigor, with his battle prowess magnified over 80-fold thanks to the blessing of the first-grade seal. This was simply astonishing, with a single strike capable of severely wounding Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly. With a single thought, countless seals instantly lit up on his body.

“What a surprise! You actually mastered this many seals?” Meng Dong exclaimed with astonishment. “However, what does that matter? It’s merely quantity with no quality. No matter the quantity, it’s still nothing but a waste!”

He charged over again, yearning to suppress Ling Han.

Ling Han remained silent as he replied with a punch.

Peng!

A stunned expression instantly washed over Meng Dong’s face as he was involuntarily sent flying back. He became quicker and quicker, eventually crashing into an extremely distant mountain with a thunderous impact, blasting it into oblivion.

This was a combination seal formed from 111 ninth-grade seals—it could increase his power by 222 times!

...

Whoosh!

Meng Dong shot out from the rubble, his entire right arm gone. This was the price he paid for facing Ling Han’s attack head-on. With Ling Han’s power 100 times greater than his, this result was naturally inevitable.

He wore a stunned expression, disbelief in his eyes. He was actually this fragile and helpless!

“Combination seal!” he spat through gritted teeth.

“That’s right,” Ling Han replied. However, he didn’t waste any time, immediately charging over again.

“Ninth-grade seals!” Meng Dong muttered, the veins in his face bulging out. Ninth-grade seal had always been a synonym for trash. Just like with the gulf between the First Heaven and the Ninth Heaven, there was no comparison between first-grade seals and ninth-grade seals.

After forming a combination seal, however, things would be completely different. At that time, ninth-grade seals could turn the tables and rival first-grade seals.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han started to pummel Meng Dong. Their battle prowess was no longer on the same level.

Meng Dong was like a ragdoll at this moment, sent flying left and right with no strength to resist.

He was already unable to spit out any more weapons. Instead, he was violently spitting out blood.

...

“Little brother, you truly can’t be underestimated,” he remarked with emotion. He spat bucketloads of blood with each word, and his entire body was full of broken bones, made starkly clear by his caving flesh.

He unleashed a roar, saying, “I have no other choice; I can only call for a helper,”

His voice was thunderous, and pushed out with his mighty power, it was able to travel into the distance at an astonishing speed.

‘He still has a helper?’

Ling Han frowned upon hearing this. However, his attacks became even more rapid. Since his opponent had a helper, it was naturally important for him to finish this battle even quicker. Otherwise, once his power ran out, it would be difficult to say who would end up dead.

Yet, Meng Dong’s helper arrived even sooner than Ling Han anticipated.

In just a few seconds, a figure had already flown over from the distance. It was a slender and attractive figure.

She was a beautiful woman with a blossom-like appearance and a graceful and seductive demeanor.

“Meng Dong, you’re actually unable to defeat our little brother?” the woman said with a silvery laugh. Her impressive breasts bounced as she spoke, a truly provoking sight for the eyes.
