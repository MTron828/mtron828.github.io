2759 Great fury

Yu Wudi agreed to take Ling Han to find his “friends,” not just because he could not bear with such torment, but because he wanted Ling Han to walk out so that others could see him. This naturally would alert the authorities of the martial academy, and they would send someone to save him.

He was certain that Ling Han had to have reached the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, or even further than that, and that was why he could take him down with a single blow.

F***, a Heavenly Venerate was being a bully, so the martial academy would definitely interfere in this matter.

Very soon, they arrived at the foot of a mountain. This was where one of Yu Wudi’s friends lived. That man’s name was Cheng Feiwen, and he was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but he did not have a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier elite among his ancestors.

!!

This small clique was led by Yu Wudi because only his father was a Heavenly Venerate, and a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate at that.

Ling Han took out a piece of Divine Metal, which he directly refined into a chain, and then tied Yu Wudi up with it. He then dragged him up the mountain.

There was not just a single abode on this mountain. Thus, the scene of Ling Han dragging Yu Wudi up the mountain was also witnessed by many people. They were all stunned. That was Yu Wudi, a dignified and great Ninth Heaven Celestial King who had an old man who was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. Why was he being dragged around as if he was a dead dog?

And who was that fierce guy that was dragging around Yu Wudi?

Those people that had been in the martial academy with Ling Han at the same time had basically already gone to the Realm Battlefield. It was only a rare few that were still staying here. Hence, no one recognized Ling Han.

When had such a freak appeared in the martial academy?

Yu Wudi felt completely humiliated. Being dragged around in circles inside the martial academy, how was he supposed to continue strutting around in the future? As soon as someone mentioned today’s matter, he would probably have to escape with his tail between his legs, right?

Yu Wudi gritted his teeth. He swore that he would definitely ask his father to step in, and have him blast Ling Han into dust.

“Ah!” he screamed in pain. The friction between his body and the ground caused his skin to split apart, and blood flowed copiously behind him.

This was because Ling Han had exerted a frightening power on his body, and added with the fact that the ground here had been tempered by Heavenly Venerates before, it was extremely hard. It was like using a millstone to grind soybeans. Even if Yu Wudi was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he could not bear this. Furthemore, his cultivation level had already been sealed off, so there was no way he could use Regulations to protect himself.

Ling Han did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy. Ever since Yu Wudi had touched his son and grandson, Ling Han had already sentenced him to death.

Ling Han ignored everyone’s attention, and proceeded the whole way up the mountain.

Everyone was extremely curious, and followed him. At the same time, there were naturally people who reported the situation to the authorities of the martial academy.

This commotion was quite large. Before Ling Han had dragged his hostage to the summit, the people above had already gotten the news, and all came out.

“B-Brother Yu!” When he saw how Yu Wudi was being dragged on the ground, Cheng Feiwen was astonished. What was going on here?

“So you are Cheng Feiwen?” Ling Han asked.

“How dare you!! You actually dare humiliate a disciple of the martial academy like this!!” Cheng Feiwen reprimanded loudly.

Within the grounds of the martial academy, as long as the difference in cultivation level was no more than two cultivation levels, they could attack freely. As long as no one was killed, and no serious injury that could not be healed was inflicted, that was fine. However, being able to wound others did not mean that humiliation would be tolerated.

Being like Ling Han, dragging Yu Wudi around like a dead dog, had indeed surpassed limits.

Ling Han nodded, and stretched out a hand to grab Cheng Feiwen.

Cheng Feiwen hurriedly retreated. Ling Han had captured even Yu Wudi, and Cheng Feiwen’s battle prowess could only be considered on the same level as Yu Wudi’s. It was definitely impossible that he would be a match for Ling Han.

However, Ling Han’s battle prowess could match a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. How could a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King be able to escape from him?

He laid down his palm, and Cheng Feiwen was already captured in Ling Han’s grasp.

“What do you want to do?” Cheng Feiwen was both furious and stunned.

Ling Han did not answer. He tied Cheng Feiwen with the chain as well, and dragged the two of them down the mountain.

“Ah!” Cheng Feiwen released an outraged roar. This was an extraordinary humiliation.

Ling Han only ignored him. He was going to find the third person.

Everyone was watching. This guy had seriously trampled over the rules of the martial academy, so an elite would definitely step in to suppress him. At that time, how was this matter going to be resolved?

Clang, clang, clang! The chains scraped the ground, causing an ear-piercing sound, and Yu Wudi and Cheng Feiwen were both yelling in pain. Their cultivation levels had been sealed off. Amidst the friction, their skin had split apart and blood flowed, leaving bloody traces behind them on the ground.

If they were not both Celestial Kings, merely this kind of blood loss would be enough to kill them.

Even so, they were both battered and mangled, making for a tragic sight.

A great many people did not know the truth of the matter, and were whispering among themselves, talking about how cruel Ling Han was to actually treat disciples of the martial academy like this.

“Have you had enough?” Just when Ling Han had reached the foot of the mountain, he heard a voice sound out in his ears.

Ling Han raised his head, his eyes looking towards the mountain peak in the distance. He shook his head. “Not enough!”

Only he could hear this voice. Thus, when they saw how Ling Han was talking to himself, everyone felt confused. Who was he talking to? And what did he mean?

Not enough? What was not enough?

“Sigh!” A low sigh rang out by everyone’s ears, and a man in gray robes appeared. He said, “Because you have acted due to your family being injured, I allowed you to punish the culprits, but now you have gone too far!”

“Lord Crimson Clouds!” Everyone fell to their knees. This was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, and also the strongest elite presently in the martial academy.

Yu Wudi and Cheng Feiwen came back to their senses, and both of them cried out loudly, “Please give us justice, Lord Crimson Clouds!”

To publicly humiliate the disciples of the martial academy within the grounds of the martial academy was a definite breach of rules, and how could the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate bluff through the matter as if nothing had happened in full public like this?

That was impossible.

These two people wanted to provoke the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate to step in and punish Ling Han.

Ling Han was expressionless. “Previously, when these people humiliated and wounded my son, have they not gone too far as well? One against one is a spar, so what is ganging up on him all at once? Since they are not abiding by the rules, what need is there for me to abide by the rules as well?”

“Then, please do not blame me!” The Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate sighed, and stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han.

If Ling Han was merely dealing with Yu Wudi in private, the Heavenly Venerate would possibly turn a blind eye to it, but that was no longer possible now. If he still made no move, what would happen to the authority of the martial academy? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han humphed, and delivered a punch in response.

Peng!

Their two blows crashed together, instantly causing a super great storm. Furthermore, those with sharp eyesight could still see that the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate had actually been sent flying.

Heavens, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate had moved, and he was actually no match for Ling Han?

After the storm dispersed, everyone could clearly see that Ling Han was still standing proudly in his original position, his back straight and upright, his expression determined, and his eyes cold, bearing a strong killing intent.

...

Today, he was determined to make these people who had injured his son and grandson pay the price that their act deserved, no matter who came.

Gasp!

Meanwhile, the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate inhaled sharply. Who was he? He immediately discovered that that last blow from Ling Han was a completely physical blow, and Ling Han had not drawn on the great power of heaven and earth, but even so, it had still overwhelmed him.

Though the Crimson Clouds had not reached consummate level for Second Tier, he was still a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, and he was actually outmatched?

What kind of freak was this?!

And Yu Wudi and Cheng Feiwen’s expressions were filled with despair. Not even a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate was a match for Ling Han?

If that was really the case, then even if the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate returned, would he be capable of suppressing Ling Han?

Heavenly Venerates possessed unimaginable privileges. As long as they did not side with Hysteria, what was the simple matter of humiliating a Ninth Heaven Celestial King worth?

Would they ever manage to get revenge for today’s humiliation?
