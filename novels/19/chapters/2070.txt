Chapter 2071: Unleashing Everything

‘What?!’

Xia Houtong almost choked upon hearing this. Ji Wuming had slain his clan’s ancestor?

In reality, the Xiaohou Clan was a distant descendent of the Gouchen, and it was only in Xia Houtong’s case that the bloodline had suddenly reverted to its ancient roots. Add to that his astounding cultivation talent, and he was ultimately able to become a paramount monarch tier.

Xia Houtong had naturally never seen the Gouchen before. However, he was well aware that his ancient ancestor had been one of the most powerful beings in the world. The Gouchen was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

Now, however, a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator was shamelessly claiming that he had slain his ancient ancestor? Just what kind of joke was this?!

However, these words had been spoken by Ji Wuming, so no one dared to treat it as a joke.

This was the strength and charisma of Ji Wuming.

“You… Who in the world are you?” Xia Houtong asked in a solemn voice. He carefully observed himself, and to his utter shock, he discovered that his Gouchen power was actually yielding to Ji Wuming.

This was the mysterious power of heaven and earth.

For example, if two powerful Source Beasts battled, leading to the death of one, the descendants of the defeated party would suffer natural suppression from the descendants of the victorious party.

This was a form of fate. Source Beasts were born from the mandate of heaven, so when they were killed, heaven and earth would also shift their power of fate elsewhere.

Of course, elites could overcome this kind of suppression. They could defy the heavens and change their fate.

However, Xia Houtong discovered that before Ji Wuming, his Gouchen power was much like a mouse before a cat. He was completely suppressed, and his Gouchen power trembled in apprehension.

This was the suppression from the heavenly fate. Moreover, this wasn’t suppression from the victor’s descendants. Instead, it was suppression from his ancestor’s slayer!

‘How can a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator kill a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Isn’t this a joke?!’

Xia Houtong couldn’t help but voice his doubt.

Ji Wuming smiled, and said, “Back then, when the storm of darkness descended, the Gouchen refused to come forward and join the battle. In a fit of anger, I stormed over and killed him. By doing so, I was finally able to stabilize the morale of the army. Otherwise, that storm of darkness might have already overcome us.

“Who would’ve thought? After reincarnating, I’m about to kill another descendant of the Gouchen.”

These words… carried an astonishing amount of information.

The arrival of the storm of darkness had actually required Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to mobilize? Moreover, several Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had needed to come together to resist it? In fact, even such elites had faced perilous danger, so much so that the Gouchen had shirked battle!

Ji Wuming had then executed the Gouchen before the army to raise their morale.

Could the Gouchen have willingly accepted death? This was naturally impossible. He had definitely resisted with all his might. Even so, he had still been slain.

Just how powerful had Ji Wuming been?

The Gouchen was a Source Beast, and it was more so one of the most powerful Source Beasts. Yet, it had still been killed by Ji Wuming. At that time, just how overwhelmingly powerful had Ji Wuming been?

“N-Ninth Heaven Celestial King!” Xia Houtong stammered. He almost wet his pants in fright.

Even though he was confident that he could definitely become a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, any progress above that would completely be up to his luck and fate. Progressing any further wasn’t something that could be accomplished simply through talent and hard work.

Ninth Heaven Celestial King… He only dared to dream about this.

However, so what if he became a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Even his ancient ancestor had been slain by this person.

Such kind of reincarnated Celestial King… Who in the world could rival them?

No wonder he had aroused the Most Venerable Divine Path. During his past life, Ji Wuming had definitely been one of the most powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. He had been a genuine paragon of the Celestial Realm!

Then… what about Ling Han?

Xia Houtong involuntarily looked toward Ling Han. This person had also triggered the Most Venerable Divine Path.

“I’m certainly no reincarnated Celestial King,” Ling Han said with a smile. Since Ji Wuming was in no hurry to attack, he naturally wasn’t in a hurry, either. In any case, he was still pondering the storm of darkness at this moment. Just what kind of calamity had that been? It had actually forced so many Celestial Kings to band together to fight against. Moreover, they had seemingly failed to comprehensively deal with it.

‘So Ling Han isn’t a reincarnated Celestial King…’ Xia Houtong breathed a sigh of relief—even though this couldn’t change the current situation. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ji Wuming smiled, and said, “He isn’t a reincarnated Celestial King, but he’s the successor of a Heavenly Venerate. Heavenly Venerates are the next major tier up from Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. They’re the true paragons and rulers of the world.”

Pu!

Xia Houtong’s eyes bulged in shock and disbelief.

‘What?! There are even more powerful beings above Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings?

‘Most Venerable Divine Path!

‘Perhaps… only those who have the potential to become a Heavenly Venerate can trigger this dragon bridge?’

Xiu!

Ji Wuming suddenly lashed out while Xia Houtong was still stuck in a daze. His sword flashed, and Xia Houtong’s head instantly flew into the sky. His lifeless eyes were filled with confusion and disbelief as he stared at Ji Wuming.

‘You’re a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King! How can you be so lowly and shameless? How can you launch such a sneak attack against a junior?’

However, he had been beheaded by a Celestial Tool, so how could he possibly survive?

Not to mention him, even Ascending Origin Tier elites couldn’t possibly survive such an attack.

Even though Xia Houtong’s Gouchen power had been suppressed by Ji Wuming, he had still possessed the power of a paramount monarch tier. Thus, as long as he dispelled his Gouchen power, he could have definitely rivaled Ji Wuming and Ling Han.

However, he had been stunned by Ji Wuming’s words. In his moment of shock, he had then been swiftly killed by his opponent. He had indeed died a miserable and vexing death.

Ling Han glanced at Ji Wuming. This person was willing to do anything to achieve his aims.

He had purposefully mentioned the Gouchen, and he had then purposefully revealed a shocking piece of information. His aim for doing so was simply to stun Xia Houtong, at which time he could easily kill him.

Brutal, decisive, merciless, and completely shameless.

Anyone would struggle against such an opponent.

Ji Wuming turned around to glance at Ling Han, saying, “Rest assured, if I want to kill you, I’ll do so fair and square.”

‘Oh, really?’

Ling Han shook his head in his mind. Right now, he didn’t believe a single word coming out of Ji Wuming’s mouth.

This person was far too strange. Sometimes, his trust in others would seem blind and misplaced. For example, when cooperating with Ling Han, he had completely handed him his back. He hadn’t worried about Ling Han seizing the opportunity to stab him in the back.

Just then, however, he had clearly possessed the advantage, yet he had still used such an underhanded method.

One could only say that he would do anything to achieve his aims.

He was ruthless and ambitious!

Ji Wuming turned around, and said, “Continue!” They had only killed a single paramount monarch tier. There were still three remaining.

Regardless of how Tian Qingyue and the others fled, since this battle had begun, it would last for 10 days before any of them could leave. Moreover, the canyon was only so big, so where could they hide?

Ling Han and Ji Wuming started to scour the canyon. They only had to find the three supreme monarch tiers. The remaining cultivators were mediocre, so most of them would be killed by the black figures.

The two of them strolled through the canyon. Even though the black figures pursued and attacked them, these attacks were completely useless against them. They could annihilate the black figures with a simple wave of their hand.

After an hour or so, they found Zhu Huiyun standing atop a large boulder. As the mountainous winds swept past, her dress gently fluttered in the air, making her appear like a celestial maiden.

She directly faced Ling Han and Ji Wuming just like that. It was as if she were going to fight them to the death here.

Ling Han swept his gaze across the surroundings. There was nothing but empty space beside this boulder, so it was impossible for anyone to be hiding. However, the boulder beneath Zhu Huiyun was truly very large. It… was definitely large enough for people to hide behind.

This was a place that the naked eye couldn’t see. However, this didn’t matter. Ling Han unleashed his divine sense, which could act as his eyes.

He didn’t “see” any abnormalities.

However, it made absolutely no sense for Zhu Huiyun to stand here and wait for them.

Ji Wuming strode forward, and said, “Just kill her!”

He seemingly didn’t care even if a dragon’s lair lay before them.
