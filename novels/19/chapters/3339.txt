Chapter 3340: Act of Violence

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Qin Zhengchu’s side stopped causing trouble. Xuanyuan Dingguo also felt as if he had punched empty air. He couldn’t charge up to fight, right?

The people on both sides continued to watch the battle, and for the moment, everything was peaceful.

The battle between Ma Jiu and Xin Si soon ended. They were fighting very intensely, and very soon, their blood and Qi were boiling, as they carried out the most explosive clash. In the end, it was still Xin Si, the ever victorious king, that had once again attained victory.

“Tsk, you dare call this kind of trash invincible?” A cloaked person scoffed.

“It can’t be helped. The overall strength of the Dark North Nation is too weak, so what elites could there be?” another cloaked person said.

“A bunch of trash, what’s the point of negotiating with them? Just send out troops and conquer them, so they can become subjects,” a third cloaked person said.

When these words fell, everyone in the arena was enraged.

‘F*ck! What the f*ck are you people talking about?’

Ling Han looked towards Xuanyuan Dingguo, and Xuanyuan Dingguo also looked towards him. They all gave an ‘oh’. As it turned out, these cloaked figures were envoys from Yue Empire!

It was unknown whether this Young Master Hu was that Imperial Prince.

“What is it? Are you all still unconvinced?” A cloaked person stood up, and surveyed the masses, “In our Yue Empire, even a three-year-old child is a hundred times stronger than those two trash.”

Yue Empire?

Some people were confused. What kind of force was this? However, some people had heard of it before, and couldn’t help but become serious.

Once this matter became serious, it could possibly become a serious diplomatic matter. Furthermore, Yue Empire’s strength should be very terrifying. Just a random Imperial Prince they sent already had the cultivation level of Enlightenment Tier.

Instantly, a great many people sat down, and chose to sit by and watch. Even if the sky collapsed, wasn’t there still someone taller holding it up? There was no need for them to stand out.

“Hurry up and apologize!”

“Kneel down and apologize.”

“You actually dare to boast shamelessly in the Imperial Capital. Which countryside have you all come from?”

Those who didn’t know the details called out. They were all second-generation young masters, so bullying outsiders was naturally no big deal to them.

Xiu, a cloaked figure leaped out. Peng, peng, peng! Fists and kicks were used at the same time, and figures were sent flying. The second-generation young masters who had previously been shouting were instantly sent flying.

F***, he actually dared to make a move?

Even more people were angered. You outsiders have come to the Imperial Capital, and actually still dare to commit an act of violence?

“Bunch of trash, is there anyone that can fight?” The cloaked man swept his gaze around, and finally jumped into the tournament stage. “Come, those who don’t like it, come up here and see how Brother Wolf will deal with you guys.” “F***, he’s too arrogant!” Immediately, someone couldn’t bear it any longer, and jumped onto the tournament stage.

Peng!

However, before he could even steady his footing, he was sent flying with a kick. He crashed heavily into the opposite wall, and actually created a hole in it. Instantly, a large amount of blood seeped out. His whole person was no longer moving, and it was unknown whether he was dead or alive.

“F*ck!” This scared some people, but even more people flew into a thunderous rage. Immediately, some jumped onto the tournament stage again.

Peng, he was also immediately sent flying, and fell heavily onto the ground. There were five gaping wounds on his chest, as if they had been torn open by sharp claws.

“Brother Wolf has already said that none of you can fight,” the cloaked Brother Wolf said.

“Haha, Little Wolf is quite mighty.”

“After all, he can be ranked in the top twenty of the younger generation of our Yue Empire. He alone is enough to sweep aside all other cultivators of the same cultivation level in this weak Majestic Empire.

“Quick, quick, quick. Weaklings, is there no one else that can fight?”

Aside from Young Master Hu, the cloaked figures all called out, extremely arrogant.

Everyone was furious. Firstly, that “Brother Wolf” was indeed very strong, and secondly, the prodigies in the Imperial Capital were unprepared. How many of them here could fight?

“Hurry up and find someone!”

“That’s right. We can’t allow them to continue being so arrogant.”

“Do they really think that there is no one capable in our Imperial Capital?” Quite a number of people immediately contacted their friends through the optical computer.

Brother Wolf laughed mischievously, and said, “Don’t you guys have a so-called freak that can suppress the heavens, Hong Tianliang or whatever his name is? Let him come out, and we’ll see how Brother Wolf will suppress him!”

“That’s Hong Tianbu!”

“Humph, if Hong Tianbu makes a move, you will immediately be blasted into smithereens!” Everyone immediately retorted.

“Then let him move!” Brother Wolf continued to provoke.

“Humph, Hong Tianbu is currently exploring an ancient site, so he doesn t have the time to deal with a minor character like you,” someone said.

“Pei, if he doesn’t dare to show himself to fight with Brother Wolf, what’s there to say!” Brother Wolf scoffed. “Oh, that’s right, there’s also a second Hong Tianbu called… Ling Han, right? Call him over and see how Brother Wolf beats him until he calls him grandpa.”

Xuanyuan Dingguo couldn’t help but look at Ling Han. The main character was here, so he had to be careful not to be immediately beaten.

Yet Ling Han was leisurely drinking wine. His anger had already risen, but it had not reached the point of exploding.

“Let me fight you!” A soft whistle rang out, and a young man had already leaped onto the tournament stage, “I am a Fifth Change Blood Transformation Tier, so it cannot be considered bullying you.”

“It’s Man Hongsheng!” Someone immediately recognized him.

“The prodigy of the Man Clan. Though he has been trapped at the end of the Fifth Change for many years, he has also polished his battle prowess to a powerful extent. If he unleashes his full power, he would not be much inferior to the First Extreme.”

“Now, we should be able to defeat that arrogant guy.”

Meanwhile, Brother Wolf stretched out a hand, hooking a finger through his cloak, still incredibly disdainful.

“Take this!” Man Hongsheng’s blood boiled, and he pushed his strength to the extreme. Then, he charged towards Brother Wolf.

Brother Wolf used his movement technique to dodge. It was clear that there was only a little space in the arena, but he still managed to dodge Man Hongsheng’s attacks time and time again.

Everyone was stunned. This was so exaggerated. He could dodge a burst of power like this even without boiling blood and Qi?

However, looking at how Brother Wolf was jumping here and there, why did he really seem like a wolf?

However, Man Hongsheng’s strength was indeed extraordinary, and added with the fact that his blood and Qi was boiling, after a few dozen moves, he finally forced Brother Wolf into a corner, leaving Brother Wolf with only two options—either confront him head-on, or jump off the tournament stage. “Humph, do you really think that Brother Wolf is afraid of you?” Brother Wolf roared, and an astonishing scene appeared. His body actually enlarged a bit, so much so that his cloak was slightly out of shape. His whole person was exuding a terrifying aura.

Peng!

He pushed out with both hands, exchanging blows with Man Hongsheng.

A victorious smile appeared on Man Hongsheng’s face. He was at the peak stage of Fifth Change, and his blood and Qi was also boiling. Just how terrifying was his power now?

However, before his smile could fade, his eyes became incredibly shocked, and his whole person was sent flying. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Pa, he fell heavily onto the ground, his limbs sprawled out widely, no longer able to move.

“So weak!” Brother Wolf cackled, and with a shake of his body, his inflated body actually shrunk back.

Yi?

Ling Han was astonished. Just then, it was clear that Brother Wolf had also gotten a burst of power. Although he hadn’t revealed his blood and Qi, once his blood and Qi boiled, it couldn’t be stopped. So, why was he able to stop midway?

Didn’t this mean that he could still explode a second time, three times, or even a hundred times?

“Anyone else?” Brother Wolf leaped out, one foot stepping on Man Hongsheng: chest as he swept his gaze over everyone.. “You’re all trash, not a single one of you can fight!”
