Chapter 2081: It’s him, Ling Han!

Ling Han did not stand up at the first moment, because after he had passed the eighth stage, a very great change suddenly happened in the spiritual world.

Multiple pill recipes appeared in front of him, and he had never seen any of them before, which filled him with excitement. He could not help but take them down one by one, inscribing them deeply into his memory.

Hence, he spent a little bit of time.

In the spiritual world, that ice cold voice stated, “Leave your name, which can be emblazoned, and will never be erased for eternity.”

“Which rank would it be?” Ling Han asked.

“Third,” this voice answered.

Only third?

Ling Han shook his head. “Then forget it.” He had no wish to have the names of two others pressing down on his right until the end of time.

…However, what he did not know was that the two people before him had not recognized herbs when they had been Three-Star Alchemists, but had re-examined their own ability of recognizing herbs when they were close to breaking through to become Five-Star Alchemists, and that was why they were slightly superior to him.

If Ling Han had come to undergo the test to recognize herbs again when he became a Four-Star Grandmaster, the time that he would need to pass the eighth stage would definitely be considerably reduced, and it would possibly be very easy for him to attempt even for first place.

It could not be helped. In alchemy, he was a true Alchemy Emperor that was unrivaled.

Just when he said “forget it”, Ling Han was kicked out of the spiritual world. Thus, he opened his eyes, and stood up.

No one gave him a second look, because no one thought that it was him that had passed the eighth stage.

How could it be?

If this prodigy had ended his test, the Stone of Herbology would show his name—or a code name, or a title.

Leaving no name?

Why?

No one could imagine the possibility of someone doing that. This was leaving their name behind for eternity, a legendary feat that would be passed down through the ages.

Even Alchemist Riyang and Wu Zixu were looking in all directions. They anxiously wished to know who exactly was this person that had surpassed them, and was in fact the strongest person that could be named in an epoch.

At this time, that apprentice came again.

He raced over to Ling Han, his expression bearing incredible shock. As an apprentice of Ancient Alchemy Tower, he had a grasp of more information than others. For example, he had seen Ling Han’s results through a special connecting stone.

Eight stages!

Heavens, if this news was sent back to the Ancient Alchemy Tower, those elders might personally make their way here, contending with each other to take Ling Han as their disciple.

If anyone had been more attentive, they would have been able to see the astonished, reverent, and ingratiating expressions that crossed and merged together on his face at this moment, and then they could possibly deduce something was up.

Unfortunately, everyone was curious about who this super dark horse was at present, so what mood would they be in to pay attention to a mere alchemy apprentice?

“Young Master Ling!” that apprentice called out respectfully. Ling Han’s registration information was contained on the connecting stone, and now he was making a second verification that the two Ling Hans were the same person, and could not allow for a fake to pass off as the genuine Ling Han.

“Let me verify your results,” he said in a tone of enquiry.

‘Hmm?’

Those at the side heard him, and they all thought this was extremely strange.

Hadn’t this apprentice been arrogant all this while? Aside from the few people who had passed the seventh stage, they had never seen him act so polite. And now, what was going on here? It was like he wanted nothing more than to kneel down like a suck-up.

“He should be the disciple of some grandmaster of alchemy, right?”

“Who knows, he may be a member of Ancient Alchemy Tower that has deliberately come to show off.”

“F***, this is the kind that I hate the most.”

Everyone expressed their disdain for Ling Han. A spoiled young master that was showing off was just asking for a beating.

“All right,” Ling Han nodded very carelessly.

“Your result is passing eight stages, and the time taken is…”

Hua, a bout of shocked exclamations completely submerged the remaining words of that apprentice.

Eight stages! The freak that had passed eight stages was actually him!

Gods!

Those that had previously sneered at Ling Han wanted nothing more than for a hole to appear in the ground so that they could jump in—even if Ling Han really was a show-off spoiled young master, this feat of showing off was still earth-shaking, and others could only salute it in respect.

“Yi, this person seems to be slightly familiar.”

“Young Master Ling… Young Master Ling… Ling Han!”

“That’s right, he is Ling Han!”

“What Ling Han? Hehe, you guys can’t be saying that this Ling Han is that Ling Han who has killed Tian Qingyue and the other four great super monarch tiers, right?”

“You’ve got to be kidding. They must just have the same name.”

“That’s right. It must be someone having the same name.”

“It is said that that Ling Han only has the cultivation level of Yang Soul, yet can kill super monarch tiers of Heaven Soul. His natural talent in cultivation level is practically turning history on its head! How could this kind of person possibly also be a freak of alchemy?”

“That’s right. And it’s said that that Ling Han has a really big ****, so that is obviously not right.”

Pu, Ling Han almost spluttered and choked. Why were they still talking about the subject of having a big ****? F***, who was the one who came up with this? Step out, and see if he wouldn’t kill him.

“However, he also seems to be a Yang Soul as well.”

“And they look very similar.”

“And both are called Ling Han!”

“Gasp!”

After a large circle, everyone inhaled sharply, gradually believing in that possibility—that the two Ling Hans were one and the same.

Then, they began to exclaim in shock, and grab their heads, feeling as if their world perspective had collapsed in an instant.

How could there exist such a freak in this world?

“Done with the verification?” Ling Han asked the apprentice.

“Yes, yes.” That apprentice hurriedly nodded, wanting nothing more than to kneel down in reverence of Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled. “Then I’m leaving.”

“Let me see you off, Young Master Ling.” That apprentice did not care if there were others who had just ended their test as well. In front of Ling Han, all other people were no longer important.

Ling Han turned around, and strode off.

“Wait!” However, he had only taken a few steps when someone stood in his way.

It was Wu Zixu.

“Ling Han, right?” Wu Zixu’s expression was filled with defiance. “I am Wu Zixu. I admit that your ability in recognizing herbs is stronger than mine.”

Wasn’t that just meaningless words? Just check how many people had passed the eighth stage in history? At least, below the level of Three-Star Alchemist, there had only been a mere seven people that have managed to pass the eighth stage—and now adding Ling Han, it was eight in total.

What need was there for you to admit this fact?

“However, the ultimate deciding factor for an alchemist is still the ability in pill concoction. In the following two tests, I will definitely not lose to you!” Wu Zixu declared resolutely.

Ling Han merely responded with a slight smile. In alchemy, his only rival had always been himself. He only had to surpass himself, and there had never been anyone that was worthy of becoming his rival.

…Unlike in cultivation, where there was still this kind of true freak like Ji Wuming.

“Just wait, I will definitely defeat you!” Wu Zixu said these last words, and then left first.

To leave before Ling Han also seemed to be a kind of demonstration of force, declaring “I am determined to be ahead of you”.

However, he had ended his test of recognizing herbs, so he should have left anyway. Still, because his status was higher, no one went to usher him away for the moment, but if he continued staying longer, he would still have to leave, whoever he was.

Ling Han smiled involuntarily. This really was a youth, and that was why he was so rash.

Alchemist Riyang also walked over. However, he only looked at Ling Han and did not speak.

“Old man, you have also a bunch of energy accumulated, and plan to defeat me during pill concoction?” Ling Han asked with a grin.

“Though it is a little inappropriate to issue a challenge to a youngster like yourself, now that this implicates my reputation and pride, I will definitely try my utter best and defeat you,” Alchemist Riyang said.

He really was a veteran alchemist, and had long since touched the threshold of Four-Star Alchemist, but always seemed to lack that little bit, and could not actually step into this higher level. Perhaps a rival like Ling Han would be a trigger that would really help him to surpass himself.
