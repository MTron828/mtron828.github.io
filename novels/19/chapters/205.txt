Chapter 206: Arrest

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Just a small thing like that?”

A small thing like that?

Putting aside the issue of Nangong Ji’s identity, the rules of the Academy clearly stated that spars were acceptable, but crippling injuries and deadly attacks were strictly forbidden. Anyone who broke the rules would be harshly punished. Additionally, there was the issue of Nangong Ji’s identity. He was the young master of a middle-class clan, and furthermore had an elder brother who was a True Disciple. How could the Nangong Clan simply let the matter go?

Zhu Wu Jiu was a very solitary character. Anyways, he was all alone with no family. If they wanted his life, they were free to claim it. Either way, he had already crippled Nangong Ji.

For a martial artist, crippling his cultivation was no better than killing him directly, especially in those bigger clans. The status of a crippled martial artist would fall dramatically in his own clan, and anyone was free to come over and give him another kick while he was down. That strong disparity in his treatment would be enough to cause anyone to commit suicide.

Obviously, Zhu Wu Jiu had the ability to kill Nangong Ji. Yet he had only crippled the latter’s cultivation to allow Nangong Ji to experience that colossal disparity, and give him a worse punishment.

“Just stay here for now, and I’ll see who dares to come capture you,” Ling Han said calmly.

What a boastful tone. When the people sent from the Discipline Committee of the Academy arrived, would you really dare to jump out? So what if you did dare to jump out? For a mere martial artist in Element Gathering Tier, wasn’t that merely overrating yourself and attempting to do the impossible?

But when he thought about it, Ling Han was well-intentioned, so Zhu Wu Jiu nodded, and said, “Thank you, but I was the one who caused this trouble, so I will definitely not drag you into it!”

Ling Han merely smiled. If he continued to say anything more, it was likely Zhu Wu Jiu would think that he was bragging. He had no intention to be looked down upon by a descendant of the Silver Moon Race.

“Brat, a lot of people are here!” Guang Yuan arrived in a leap. He had heard the commotion and recalled the fact that he was now Ling Han’s bodyguard, and so naturally came to inform him and stood on one side to watch.

“They’re here to arrest me,” Zhu Wu Jiu said calmly. He had already fulfilled his heart’s desire, so he was absolutely unconcerned about whether he lived or died anymore.

“That’s right. Here to capture you!” A group of ten walked in. The one in the lead was a young man who looked to be in his mid-twenties, and there was arrogance and rage in his expression.

The Captain of Team Four of the Discipline Committee, Nangong Xing. He was also Nangong Ji’s elder brother, and in the third layer of Gushing Spring Tier!

He was of course furious. Zhu Wu Jiu actually dared to cripple his younger brother’s Dantian. This was a challenge to the authority of the Nangong Clan and also a harsh slap to his face, making him feel the urge to commit murder.

“Since you already know, are you not going to submit yourself to be arrested?” Nangong Xing asked coldly. He threw a challenging look at Ling Han.

He was naturally defiant. A mere minor character in Element Gathering Tier was actually able to cause waves in the Academy and become a famous person in Hu Yang Academy; also, according to rumors, even the two extreme beauties, Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan, were close to him.

His eyes had turned red from feeling extreme jealousy!

In his eyes, Ling Han had merely gotten a bout of **** good fortune, and had merely obtained the prestige he had now because of Feng Yan. Moreover, if it was not the fact that he was so extremely fortunate and was rescued by the Headmaster of the Alchemy Department who had so coincidentally happened to pass by, this guy would have long been torn to pieces by Feng Yan.

He looked at Ling Han, and a cold smile appeared on his lips as he said, “Ling Han, are you going to cover for this criminal?”

“This has nothing to do with Ling Han!” Zhu Wu Jiu stepped out. It was because of Ling Han’s help that he had managed to surpass Nangong Ji’s cultivation level and get his vengeance. It was already enough that he could not repay Ling Han’s kindness, so how could he allow Ling Han to be dragged down by him into this matter?

“You’re sensible.” Nangong Xing humphed. If Ling Han dared to show off at this time, he would not mind arresting one more person.

…Aren’t you very mighty? Then I’ll arrest you and go one round in the Academy, and let’s see if you still have any face left to see anyone.

“Apprehend him and drag him back!” Nangong Xing waved his hand.

Immediately, two people walked towards Zhu Wu Jiu. One of them had a chain in his hands. This was forged from Black Blood Iron. Once a person was chained by this chain, then even an elite of Spiritual Ocean Tier would not be able to escape.

“Hold on!” Ling Han stepped out and stretched out a hand to block their advance. He said, “This is one of mine. You people want to capture him, but have you gotten my approval yet?”

“Hahaha!” Nangong Xing was delighted. Ling Han actually wanted to interfere; then that was great. He was just being troubled over having no excuse to do anything to Ling Han, and this brat actually delivered himself to be stamped on.

“Ling Han, how dare you!” he shouted in rebuke. “This is a criminal that the Academy has commanded to be arrested!”

“Wrong!” Ling Han held up and finger and waved it from left to right. “Whether it is a crime or not, he should still undergo a trial to be judged. Yet you keep saying ‘criminal’ here and there. Does that mean you’re above the Academy? From how I look at it, you’re the one who is extremely bold.”

Nangong Xing could not help but be at a loss for words. Then, he said in anger and embarrassment, “Ling Han, you are merely twisting the facts! I am commanded to make the arrest, and if you dare to interfere, I will apprehend you as well!”

“Hehe. If anyone dares to touch one of my people, I would not mind breaking his legs.” Ling Han’s eyes swept over the whole group, and he grinned. “If you’re not scared, you all can give it a try, but don’t say I didn’t warn you!”

The expressions on the members of the Discipline Committee all changed. When they thought about how he had sliced off Feng Luo’s arms… according to the Academy regulations, this was a crime in no way lighter than Zhu Wu Jiu crippling Nangong Ji’s cultivation.

But this guy was still completely safe and unharmed. Even Feng Yan, who was very influential at this time, seemed to be unable to do anything against him, so no one dared to think of his threats as mere empty words.

When he saw the fearful expressions of his subordinates, Nangong Xing could not help but feel enraged and humiliated, and said, “This is the Hu Yang Academy, who would dare to be above the Academy?”

When they heard these words, quite a number of people rolled their eyes secretly.

There were indeed none who dared in the past. But just some time ago, Feng Luo had already broken the rules, and expelled Li Hao for no reason whatsoever. Then, Ling Han, who had sliced off Feng Luo’s arms, was not punished at all. When one now talked about the Academy rules, it was always with a tone of sarcasm…

“Young Master Han, I don’t want to involve you,” Zhu Wu Jiu said as he turned back to face Ling Han. He would accept Ling Han’s good intentions, but could not bear to have him dragged into this matter for his sake.

“Nonsense. If you want to battle to death for my sake in future, there would be a lot of opportunities for you to do so. But now, be quiet and stand behind me obediently.” Ling Han waved him off, and turned to look at Nangong Xing. “I do not welcome outsiders here. Would you like to leave on your own, or would you like me to toss you all out?”

“Ling Han, don’t be so conceited!” Nangong Xing strode forwards, and his sword left its sheath. He stared at Ling Han for a moment, then said with a smirk, “You’ve gone mad from cultivation, haven’t you? Your cultivation actually dropped to the first layer of Element Gathering Tier? With such little ability, you still dare to be so insolent in front of me? Just you watch as I force you all into submission with a single move!”

Zhu Wu Jiu gritted his teeth and stepped in front of Ling Han. He also drew his sword, and said, “Nangong Xing, I can go with you. This matter has nothing to do with Young Master Han. Don’t force me to make a move!”

Nangong Xing hesitated slightly. Zhu Wu Jiu was also in Gushing Spring Tier. Though his ability was beneath his own, but if he really forced the former into desperate straits, then even if he managed to apprehend him successfully, he would have to pay a heavy price.

He was only jealous of Ling Han, which was why he wanted to embarrass him, but if the price for such an act was that he would suffer heavy injuries? He was not as foolish as that.

“All right!” He nodded.

“Little Jiu Jiu, when did it start that you were the one to make decisions around here? Just stand at one side!” Ling Han clapped a hand onto Zhu Wu Jiu’s shoulder and pulled him back. His characteristic of covering for his own people was fully activated. He waved Nangong Xing off, and said, “Get lost quickly. Don’t say I’m bullying you. Find someone stronger.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘F***!’ Nangong Xing was so angry his whole face was twisted.
