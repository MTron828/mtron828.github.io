Chapter 1252: Heaven’s might versus dragon’s might

The True Dragon was a very frightening creature.

According to legends, it was a beloved child of heaven and earth. It was born powerful, and when it matured, it was a being of the Genesis Tier.

This would be enough to cause all other living beings to die of envy. Without needing to cultivate, merely eating, drinking, and sleeping, it would automatically reach the Genesis Tier. However, being loved by the heavens was only limited to those with a pure bloodline of the True Dragon. Once the bloodline watered down, they could not possibly reach Genesis Tier as easily as that.

Perhaps they might even be no different from ordinary living beings, and merely possess some special abilities.

Like the dragon’s might.

The True Dragon released its might, and even heaven and earth would pale!

Ao Ziyun’s bloodline was naturally far from pure, and if he wanted to break through to the Genesis Tier, he could only depend on his own efforts and good luck. His bloodline would not have much influence on his chances.

Of course, if he reached the Genesis Tier, his bloodline would then completely become the bloodline of the True Dragon, and if he married another True Dragon, the children of this union would very possibly inherit this kind of bloodline, and reach the Genesis Tier easily.

Presently, Ao Ziyun’s dragon’s might naturally could not compare to the True Dragon’s. After all, it was limited by his cultivation level, but when he released the might of his bloodline, it was still very, very frightening. Even if it was an opponent in the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, with a strike from his dragon’s might like this, his abilities would also drop greatly by at least one or two stars.

What Ancient Divine Beast was not extremely awesome? Furthermore, the True Dragon was the head of the Divine Beasts, with only the True Phoenix capable of matching it. As this strike of dragon’s might shot out, it turned solid, and enshrouded a threshold of an entire 10 miles. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Which also meant that within 10 miles, every living creature’s battle prowess would drop by one to two stars.

“Facing my dragon’s might, what right do you have to be insolent?” Ao Ziyun smirked coldly. This brat from the Immortal Realm could not be considered weak. He actually forced him to use dragon’s might.

Weng, dragon’s might attacked, and roared like a real dragon in Ling Han’s mind, wanting to intimidate him.

Dragon’s might?

Ling Han acted as if he felt nothing. What a joke. He was a man who had grasped heaven’s might—if worse came to worst, he had previously refined the Demonic Power Source. And what level was the Demon Master at? The Genesis Tier!

Both were in the Genesis Tier, so who would be afraid of the other? Moreover, Ao Ziyun’s abilities were still far from reaching the level of a True Dragon.

And he still wanted to intimidate him like this?

“What!?” Seeing Ling Han was still standing proudly and firmly like a mountain, Ao Ziyun couldn’t help the change in his expression. This was too inconceivable. This person was actually not affected by his dragon’s might?

He had tried it before, and those superior to him by at least two minor levels—or those that similarly possessed the bloodline of an Ancient Divine Beast, such as the True Phoenix or the Black Tortoise—would be able to remain completely immune to his dragon’s might.

Could it be that this young man from the Immortal Realm was also a descendant of a Divine Beast?

This time... he had really met his match!

Ling Han grinned widely, and said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I am not a descendant of a Divine Beast. My bloodline is very clean, and I am no animal!”

“Little Han, who are you insulting! Who are you calling an animal!” Rabbit flared up first, calling out loudly from a distance.

He actually called him an animal? That was too insulting!

Ao Ziyun’s face was similarly ugly. The bloodline of the True Dragon was his pride, but in Ling Han’s eyes, it had actually been degraded to the level of an “animal”?

He could not tolerate this!

“Then allow me to see how much better you are than an animal!” he roared loudly. Multiple flaming black clouds surged out of his body as if they planned to directly burn the skies.

“As you wish!” Ling Han channeled the heaven’s might. Hong, the dragon’s might in the surroundings was instantly dispersed.

The True Dragon was awesome, but wasn’t it still born out of the heaven and earth? How could it compare to the heaven and earth itself?

Heaven’s might was the strongest might in the world!

At least that was the case in the Immortal Realm.

“What!?” Ao Ziyun instantly paled. He discovered that his power had actually dropped rapidly by as much as a whole star.

This was practically a joke. He stimulated the dragon’s might to reduce his opponent’s abilities, but he had never imagined that he would have the tables turned on him, being affected by Ling Han. His power shouldn’t have been weakened by a star.

A shudder came over him. The other was obviously only one person, so why did he give off the feeling like he was as mighty as a divine god? In front of him, he was no True Dragon, but clearly an insignificant earthworm.

“Little water snake, do you now know our awesomeness?” Rabbit called out from afar. In comparison, he was naturally more displeased with Ao Ziyun.

Ao Ziyun forcibly boosted his fighting spirit, yet could not recover his power no matter what, and was firmly suppressed by the heaven’s might. He gritted his teeth. So what if he had one less star of power? Power was only one part of battle prowess, and not the only factor.

He drew out a long spear. Upon a closer look, the spear’s body was actually made from the spine of a dragon, with a murderous aura bubbling around it. It actually resisted a portion of the heaven’s might.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. This dragon bone was actually capable of standing against heaven’s might. This was really exceptional. He smilingly asked, “Which ancestor’s dragon bone is this that you have actually made into a weapon? Aren’t you afraid that your old ancestor would not get peace even in death?”

“Humph, all the bones of those of our Ao Clan would be made into weapons to benefit our descendants for many generations. Even I will be no exception!” Ao Ziyun uttered icily. “So don’t even think you can use this method to beat down on my fighting spirit.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “You really think too highly of yourself. Stepping on a character like you won’t require me to use any psychological tricks!”

“Then just try out my Dark Destruction Black Dragon Spear!” Ao Ziyun moved, brandishing the spear as he charged to attack Ling Han.

This spear was truly exceptional. Dragon’s might surged out like an old dragon from the ancient era had been revived, wanting to penetrate the skies and flatten the realm.

Weng, the Divine Demon Sword was drawn.

If they were competing in God Tools, how could Ling Han be afraid?

Once the Divine Demon Sword was drawn, endless divine might instantly set forth. This was a future Divine Metal!

Even if this was a treasured spear forged from the bones of an old dragon, so what? Faced with the suppression of the Divine Demon Sword, it trembled madly, its dragon’s might completely extinguished.

This was a suppression from a superior level. Even if the Divine Demon Sword was only Level Five, it had reached a frightening extent in terms of quality.

Ao Ziyun was stunned. Why was he suppressed on all sides by Ling Han? Furthermore, he still had the advantage of two sub-minor levels. If that was not the case... then wouldn’t he have to accept a terrible loss?

How could there be such a freakish guy in the Immortal Realm? This caused him to recall a man that could not be defeated. At the time, when they had been on the same cultivation levels, he had lost terribly, and now, the gap between the two could hardly be controlled.

This kind of painful experience... would he have to go through it another time?

“In front of the True Dragon, all beings will have to bow!” He released a dragon roar, his hands forming into complete sets of dragon claws. Wielding the bone spear, he stabbed out at Ling Han.

Dragon’s might surged forth, and he was like the true son of the heavens.

Ling Han laughed, and brandished his sword in a slash. Sword projections interwove closely, and he was like a Divine Emperor.

So what if you were the son of the heavens? In front of the Divine Emperor, you would only be able to bow your head.

At first, the two were still in a battle between equals, but once Ling Han showed the heaven’s might, he gained the upper hand. Now, the two of them had drawn their respective God Tools, and the gap between Ao Ziyun and Ling Han was even wider. He was being completely suppressed.

The Divine Demon Sword burst out with endless Sword Qi. Every flash of Sword Qi was equivalent to a full-power attack from Ling Han, and with the combined slash of millions of sword projections, who would be able to block that?

Using the Divine Demon Sword and not using the Divine Demon Sword would place Ling Han at two completely different levels of battle prowess!
