2904 Setup

It wasn’t just the arms. Every part of Shao Ying’s body was infused with Devouring Metal, making his physique incomparably powerful.

He was completely unrestrained as he violently attacked Ling Han. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Such a concept was very simple, but even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate would not be able to do this. It seemed that it was because of Hysteria that he possessed such a bizarre ability.

Ling Han’s power naturally far surpassed Shao Ying’s. He casually attacked, and Shao Ying was sent flying; there was no need for direct contact at all. Under the suppression of his overwhelming power, this was too easy for him.

It was just like how an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to shatter a rock with a punch, as that would have caused them to injure their own fist instead. However, it would be a piece of cake for them to throw this rock away.

Shao Ying laughed loudly. “Is that all you have?”

Although he was continuously sent flying by Ling Han, he was completely unharmed.

Ling Han was speechless. Exactly whose cultivation level was higher? ‘You are treated like a punching bag by me, yet you still have a smug look on your face. Where does this sense of superiority come from?’ Ling Han didn’t know where to start even if he wanted to ridicule him.

“Hehe, we’re all family. There’s no need to fight for real.” Meng Dong tried to mediate.

“That’s right,” Lou Xiyue said as well.

Everyone was trying to mediate the fight, so Ling Han and Shao Ying naturally couldn’t continue fighting.

“Let’s fight again next time!” Shao Ying was full of fighting spirit.

“Whatever,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Come, come, come, let’s drink!” Meng Dong smiled and called out to everyone.

The eight of them sat down and began to drink.

All creations in the world were the result of the manifestation of Regulations, and it was the same even for Celestial-King-Tier Great Herbs. Thus, there was no wine that could make a Heavenly Venerate become drunk. They would absolutely be unaffected, alright? However, when Ling Han took a sip of this wine, he actually felt a wave of dizziness.

“Eh?” He was a little puzzled.

“Hehe, are you surprised?” Meng Dong said with a smile. “This is wine refined from supremely valuable medicine. Of course, it also has an effect on Heavenly Venerates.”

So that was the case indeed?

Ling Han chuckled, and continued to savor the wine, but did not swallow it.

These people were all Hysteria’s subordinates. Even if he had already made his way into the inner workings of the enemy camp, he still had to be careful. After all, even if these seven people didn’t intend to harm him, if they were related to Hysteria, how could this wine be consumed?

Ling Han only swallowed a little bit of the wine, but the Power of Dimension within his body immediately started to be frantically channeled, grinding this tiny bit of effect of the wine. Instantly, the dizziness disappeared, turning into some incomparably pure power that increased his cultivation level.

Ling Han wasn’t sure if this was wine refined from supremely valuable medicine, but it was indeed effective in increasing one’s cultivation level.

Seeing that the Power of Dimension in his body was so awesome, Ling Han no longer controlled it, and began to drink in large mouthfuls. Hong, the power in his body surged, making him feel extremely comfortable.

“Drink!” Meng Dong and the others also toasted repeatedly. “Brother, you and Ba Duo made a great contribution last time, and we haven’t organized a celebratory feast for you. This time, it’s not only a welcome ceremony for you, but also a celebratory feast. Come, drink!”

Everyone kept urging him to drink, and Ling Han didn’t refuse any of them. Very quickly, he appeared to be drunk.

As Meng Dong and the others urged Ling Han to continue drinking, cold smiles gradually appeared on their faces.

“Little Brother, you really disappoint us,” Lou Xiyue suddenly said.

“What do you mean?” Ling Han shook his head in a daze.

“Do you really think that after tampering with our Lord’s sphere, our Lord won’t be aware of it at all?” Meng Dong said coldly.

Ling Han was shocked. Hysteria actually knew that its sphere had been tampered with, and could no longer corrode the Flaming Frost Realm?

This was impossible. After all, they were separated by a whole dimension. How did Hysteria sense it?

To say that Hysteria had seen through it because there was not much effect on the Flaming Frost Realm was actually not reliable. This was because even if the dimension was weakened, it would still take a period of an epoch to show any effects. What was a mere 30 billion years?

It seemed that he had truly underestimated Hysteria’s ability.

In other words, he had not passed the “loyalty” test of Hysteria, and now he was going to be punished?

“Nonsense, you’re completely slandering me!” Ling Han said in a slurred tone.

“Hehe, you still want to prevaricate at a time like this?” Lou Xiyue said coldly.

“Don’t waste your breath on him, just kill him!” Ba Duo shouted. He hated Ling Han the most. Back then, he had been knocked to the ground by Ling Han with a single punch, and this was a great humiliation to him.

Meng Dong waved his hand. “There’s no hurry. There’s a trace of our Lord’s true energy in this wine. Even if our little brother’s abilities are heaven-defying, it’s still impossible for him to rival it. But don’t worry, Little Brother. This trace of true energy won’t do any harm to your body. Instead, it’ll allow your cultivation level to improve greatly. It’s just that—”

Ba Duo couldn’t help but interrupt, “You’ll sleep for a long time.”

“I know you’re strong, so to be safe, I even used our Lord’s true energy on you. You’re really fortunate.” Luo Ming gave a fake smile.

None of them were reluctant, because they all had the ability to absorb the life essence of Heavenly Venerates and convert it into their own power to increase their cultivation level. Thus, even after Ling Han absorbed their Lord’s true power, this energy would still return to them once he was killed.

Of course, there would definitely be some losses, but to be able to get rid of a traitor with heaven-defying abilities like Ling Han, this small price was naturally worth it.

They weren’t in a hurry. Currently, Ling Han was only drunk, but he would soon fall into a deep slumber. That would make it even easier for them to get rid of him.

The seven of them all looked at Ling Han with smirks on their faces, anticipating to see Ling Han reveal an expression of anger, defiant but helpless. This would make all the pores on their bodies to be opened.

However, Ling Han’s next action caused the corners of their mouths to twitch. This was because he reached out and snatched the wine pot, directly gulping it down in large mouthfuls.

‘F*ck, do you think you’re not dying fast enough?’

Meng Dong and the others were speechless. How could there be such a person?

Was he out of his mind? Or was it a vicious cycle where he would get drunk to death first?

“Snatch it!” Meng Dong was the first to react. Ling Han had already drunk enough wine, and it would be a waste to let him drink any more. This was because even if they could refine Ling Han’s life essence, there was still a problem with the conversion rate, and there would be losses.

The seven of them hurriedly moved to snatch the wine pot.

However, even though Ling Han was drunk, shaking his head and looking as if he could collapse at any moment, he managed to avoid all the attacks of the seven people just by swaying back and forth like this while still gulping down large mouthfuls of wine.

Meng Dong and the others were so anxious that their eyes turned red. Every time Ling Han drank an extra mouthful, how great of a waste would that be?

Previously, they hadn’t felt heartache, because that was the price they had to pay in order to take Ling Han down. However, that wasn’t the case now.

...

“Put down the wine pot!” Meng Dong roared as he continued to attack.

Ling Han said slurringly, “Why should I put it down? Who do you think you are? I just want to drink to my heart’s content!”
