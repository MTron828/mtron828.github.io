2859 The tyrannical Yue Chengwang

Ling Han began to profit quietly, but the luck of his first time was really too good. Now, though, he could not find a third Heavenly Venerable Seal no matter what he tried.

At most, he only found Great Herbs, and this was very understandable. There was naturally no shortage of celestial medicines in a dimension. As long as there was enough time, and the conditions for its growth were there, they could all become supremely valuable medicines.

That stuff was still good. It could advance cultivation level, and was greatly beneficial as well.

Ling Han needed a frightening amount of energy to take a single step forward. Hence, not only did he need a great number of Heavenly Venerable Seals, he also needed as many supremely valuable medicines as possible to push his cultivation level forwards.

!!

However, he could not completely concentrate, because he was already very famous after his three rounds of stone gambling.

“Grandmaster Ling, can you help me to take a look at this raw stone?”

“Brother Ling, won’t you join me for a drink later?”

“…”

There would always be people trying to strike up a conversation with him. Some were very reserved, saying that they wanted to befriend him, but there were some that were extremely frank, directly asking him to help look at the raw stones.

For those who were polite, Ling Han would politely refuse. He did not have that much time, and for those who had a lofty opinion of themselves, Ling Han ignored them completely.

It dawned on him. That person who had demanded him to meet with the so-called young master probably had the motive of asking for his help in stone gambling.

Heh, what a joke.

“How truly arrogant. Isn’t he just good at stone gambling?” someone grumbled lowly at the sidelines.

“Shh, could it be that you don’t know that aside from being a grandmaster of raw stone, this guy is a supreme genius? It is said that he can match a Fourth Tier! Are you tired of living?” someone beside him warned quickly. Ling Han was not some other grandmaster of raw stone. He himself had battle prowess that was terrifying.

“Yi, isn’t that Yue Chengwang?” Someone suddenly looked towards the entrance.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. The Young Master of the Yue Clan, he is an extremely overbearing guy. I heard someone had unearthed a Great Herb not too long ago, and he forcefully snatched it without paying.”

“Who said that it had been without paying? Hadn’t he paid a piece of Divine Metal? Hehe.”

“Heh, his manners are really too bad.”

“It can’t be helped. Who asked a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate to father him?”

“He’s probably here to play the same trick of gaining without risking anything of his again, isn’t he?”

“Who knows who’s the one to catch his eye now.”

Everyone was whispering, but anyone who was a Heavenly Venerate could easily hear them. Naturally, these words were heard by that young master of the Yue Clan as well.

Yet Yue Chengwang showed a hint of pride. He did not fear others talking about him behind his back; this was only proof of how strong he was.

“Young Master Yue, that’s him.” Beside him, a man pointed at Ling Han. It was the Celestial King that had stood in Ling Han’s path at the city entrance, demanding him to meet with Yue Chengwang.

“Hehe, to dare not give even me face, he is too brazen, isn’t he?” Yue Chengwang asked coldly. Since childhood, his words were like an imperial decree that no one dared to disobey.

“I shall see just how capable he is.” He just stared at Ling Han from a distance.

But what disappointed him was that Ling Han merely chose stones, but did not open them. After paying their price in Divine Metal, he would throw these pieces of raw stones into his spatial tool.

A day later, Ling Han was satisfied. He had still raked in a good catch this time, and the only disappointment was that he still lacked a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

He planned to take a rest and then move again.

“Wait!” Yue Chengwang had long since been waiting for him. Seeing that Ling Han was about to leave, he immediately raised an arm to block him.

Ling Han looked towards him, and frowned slightly. “It is said that a good dog does not block the way. Looks like you are a vicious dog.”

“Master, don’t keep talking about dogs,” Fu Tianxing hurriedly warned from the side. The large black dog might become rabid.

Yue Chengwang grimaced slightly. ‘You guys are really looking down on me, aren’t you?’ He humphed. “Ling Han, hand over the raw stones that you have just chosen. I will not let you suffer losses; I will buy them from you for double the original price.”

This was practically robbery!

Hiring a grandmaster of raw stone would cost no small amount, but he actually wanted to buy the raw stones from him for double their cost. This was really black-hearted beyond words. Ling Han had never seen someone as shameless as this.

Ling Han grinned in spite of himself. “If you want raw stones, there are more than enough here. Furthermore, what reason is there for me to sell them to you?”

“Simply because I am Yue Chengwang,” Yue Chengwang declared proudly. “You are putting on such great airs, aren’t you? I invited you once, but that actually did not move you. Hehe, you are really the first.”

Ling Han shook his head. “I don’t have the time to waste with an idiot like you. Get lost.”

“Looks like you are really ungrateful,” Yue Chengwang said coldly, yet stepped aside.

He did not dare to make a move here; the consequences were something that not even he could bear. Moreover, though he was a Third Tier, he knew that there was no way he could match Ling Han. He would have to ask the elites in their alliance to interfere to suppress Ling Han.

When Ling Han passed him by, he said, “Don’t think that I will let the matter go just like this. It won’t be too long, and you will beg to meet me, kneeling to ask for forgiveness from me.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Han turned to glance at him, and threw down a few words before leaving. “Idiot.”

‘Wh-what?’

Yue Chengwang did not even dare to believe his ears. A great Heavenly Venerate would actually be so rude, and actually throw insults?

His expression was filled with malice. He swore that he would definitely make Ling Han regret this.

Ling Han strode off. He had already foreseen this. As his strength in stone gambling was revealed, it would attract the eyes of many. Their motive was naturally wanting him to help them in stone gambling.

He returned, and unearthed a few Great Herbs. He handed them to the Empress and the others. Everyone could advance their cultivation level together. Ling Han was sure that there was no one that could suppress him once he advanced to the Fourth Tier.

…Unless a Seventh Tier appeared.

Ling Han, the Empress, and the others went into seclusion, digesting the benefits that they had reaped this time, but just when they came out of seclusion, they were greeted with the sight of a Heavenly Venerate.

This man’s surname was Ma, but his real name had long since gone out of use. His title was Highest North.

“Young lad.” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate came straight to the point. “By someone’s request, I have purposely come to bring you a message. You had best beg for mercy from Young Master Yue as soon as possible. If you do, you will still have a sliver of hope. Otherwise, heh.”

Ling Han looked towards him. “A great, dignified Fourth Tier, and you are actually playing the role of an errand boy for someone else. Don’t you think that is demeaning to yourself?”

“I am just fulfilling a request, young lad. If you don’t give me face, take care lest I will be forceful towards you,” the Highest North Heavenly Venerate said laughingly, as if he was joking.

Ling Han also smiled. “Then you should also be careful, sir. If I do make a move, I usually don’t leave any survivors.”

...

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate’s expression slightly darkened. He had not thought that not only would Ling Han ignore his advice, he would actually dare to turn around and threaten him as well. He laughed again. “The young are really overtaking the old now. The youth of today really are very courageous.”

Ling Han merely smiled, and did not reply.

“Behave yourself.” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate threw down these words and left.

But he had just left when a Four Sides Heavenly Venerate also came, and said more or less the same words to Ling Han.

This Four Sides Heavenly Venerate really had four expressions. At times, it would be a grievously weeping face, which would then be filled with anger. At times, his face would be all smiles, or overcome with hilarity. Others would really think that he had lost his mind.

Ling Han dealt with him similarly, but then came two Six Tier1 Heavenly Venerates, the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate. They all demanded that Ling Han take the initiative to plead mercy from Yue Chengwang, and only then would he have a chance of survival.

This was Yue Chengwang’s effort to show his strength to Ling Han.
