“What?!” Wu Zhe’s expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed, “Lan Yun, you’re still not dead?” He looked at the corpse on the floor.

“Hehe!” There was a chuckle, and the blue-skinned corpse on the floor surprisingly crawled up. A long shadow was cast by its nine-meter-tall figure.

Ling Han and the others were all astounded.

Although they had been suspicious whether the mysterious being was the true owner of this place, they were still stunned to see the blue-skinned elite get to his feet.

Wu Zhe stared at the blue-skinned elite, and he started to laugh loudly after a short while, saying, “So, you truly are dead. Your body is merely being controlled by a wisp of your remnant awareness.”

“Indeed!” the blue-skinned elite said with a nod. “However, it’s more than enough to kill you!”

Wu Zhe’s expression changed, and he said with a hint of panic, “You didn’t purposefully set this up, did you? Were you waiting for an opportunity to kill me? For my divine sense to leave the land’s heart and possess another body?”

The blue-skinned elite laughed loudly, and said, “Or else? You had fled to the land’s heart, and I hadn’t been able to pursue you in my dying state. If I didn’t draw you out, how would I be able to deal with you?”

“S-such forbearance!” Wu Zhe said. “It’s already been tens of millions of years, and your corpse has almost turned to dust. Why are you still holding onto such old grudges? Why do you insist on killing me?”

“Humph! Even if I die 1000 times over, I still won’t forgive wretches from the Netherworld!” the blue-skinned elite roared.

‘What?! This mysterious being is actually from the Netherworld?!’

At this moment, it finally made sense why the words carved by the blue-skinned elite were filled with fury and killing intent toward the Netherworld. From the signs of battle outside, it could be deduced that an intense battle had broken out between the two elites.

The blue-skinned elite had probably won, but suffered fatal wounds. Meanwhile, the body of the mysterious being had been obliterated such that only his divine sense remained. However, due to the unique nature of beings from the Netherworld, he had been able to hold onto life in the land’s heart.

Tens of millions of years had passed, and the mysterious being thought that the blue-skinned elite had died. Thus, he came out to possess someone’s body so that he could live a second life.

Anyhow, the restriction in this mystery realm was most likely used to suppress the mysterious being and limit his activity to the palace. Otherwise, this mysterious being should have escaped long ago with the great number of times that this mystery realm had already been opened.

The mysterious being had simply thought that the restriction was in place to suppress him for all eternity. However, he hadn’t realized that this was a double-layered scheme. The restriction was merely in place to give him a feeling of security, to make him believe that he could possess someone and escape. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Now, however, his physical body was... unbelievably fragile!

Wu Zhe trembled in apprehension. He hadn’t been this nervous and terrified even when his original body had been obliterated. He had only just possessed this body, so it was impossible for his divine sense to leave.

“Lan Yun, how scheming of you!” he spat through gritted teeth.

“Against a coward like you, how could I not scheme?” The blue-skinned elite smiled, and continued, “Don’t even think about wasting time. Although this is only a wisp of my awareness, I can still stay around for three to five days.”

Wu Zhe’s expression changed again. He had indeed wanted to waste time.

Unlike him, the blue-skinned elite had genuinely died. There was only a wisp of his awareness remaining, and it was like a flame without fuel. It would disappear in no time. However, three to five days was still too long. This blue-skinned elite absolutely despised beings from the Netherworld, so how could he last for three to five days?

Even if he spoke until his mouth was cracked and dry, it still wouldn’t be long enough to grind through five days!

The blue-skinned elite attacked, and said, “Sinking Shade Old Demon, accept your death!”

Boom!

A terrifying power swept through the palace, and even the mystery realm shuddered.

This was a power that transcended the Heavenly Body Tier!

Why didn’t the restriction attack him? What a joke; of course it didn’t! He was the owner of this place, so why would the restriction attack him?

Boom!

His palm struck down, and Wu Zhe instantly transformed into a cloud of blood. His body was far too fragile, and there was simply no way it could withstand power at the Eternal River Tier.

However, the blue-skinned elite didn’t let his guard down. Instead, he continued to scan the surroundings with his divine sense.

Elites from the Netherworld weren’t easy to kill. He had obliterated this mysterious being’s body in the past, yet his divine sense had still managed to escape.

“Humph! Still trying to escape?” The blue-skinned elite struck at the door.

Peng!

The large door shattered, and they saw a shadow frantically streak out. This shadow was extremely hard to catch with the naked eye.

It was the elite from the Netherworld!

Ling Han and the other king tiers all sucked in a sharp breath. An Eternal River Tier elite with a huge advantage in cultivation level had attacked him, yet he had still been able to survive and flee. The being from the Netherworld was unfathomably powerful.

“Lan Yun, you actually forced me to use this technique! Even if you die, I’ll still grind your bones to dust!” The shadow flew toward the Yellow Spring in the sky.

This Yellow Spring was formed from the corpse of the Netherworld elite, so his power would increase by an immense amount if he fused his divine sense into it. However, his previous body had already died, so the Yellow Spring would still be extremely dangerous to him. It was like a potent poison.

Even so, he had no option but to take a massive gamble. Otherwise, he would definitely die!

As long as he survived, there was hope that he could heal his wounds, no matter how severe they were.

The blue-skinned elite humphed, and said, “I’ve plotted for tens of millions of years now, so how can I fall at the final hurdle?”

His body flashed, and he dashed out at an incredible speed. His fist smashed into the Yellow Spring in the sky.

‘Star Plucking Step!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

Although he still hadn’t started to cultivate this movement technique yet, he could still recognize it at a single glance.

Hua!

The Yellow Spring was severed in the middle. The blue-skinned elite shuddered, and then transformed into a giant that measured 3000 meters in height. He blocked the flow of the Yellow Spring as he stood proudly in the sky.

“You...!” The Netherworld elite wanted to vomit blood. He could no longer draw on the power of the Yellow Spring. His voice shrill, he shouted, “You’re blocking the power of the Dark Yellow Spring with your body, so you’ll turn to bones in no time! If you want to die... F*ck!”

He had subconsciously treated the blue-skinned elite as a living person. However, he quickly came to his senses. Although this blue-skinned elite was jumping around and attacking him, his vitality had already disappeared long ago. He was merely a remnant wisp of awareness that definitely couldn’t last for long.

That being the case, what did it matter whether his body disintegrated or not? After all, he had already been dead for tens of millions of years.

“Hahaha! I’ve been waiting for this day!” The blue-skinned elite thrust his palm toward the shadow.

Countless divine patterns intertwined, and the glow of Regulations radiated brilliantly. This was the true power of Eternal River Tier elites.

“No!!!” the Netherworld elite wailed in despair. His wail instantly traveled throughout the entire mystery realm.

This was the despairing cry of an Eternal River Tier elite.

A thick sense of loathing and agitation hung in the air. There was also a harrowing eeriness. This was a martial intent that was unique to Netherworld cultivators.

“It’s... finally over!” A relieved smile spread across the blue-skinned elite’s face.

Boom!

His gigantic body crashed down, rapidly shrinking in size as it did so. It was then washed away by the Yellow Spring, becoming one of the tens of millions of wraiths.

A supreme elite had finally disappeared from this world once and for all.

Ling Han and the five other king tiers were all speechless. They had been close to useless in this battle—they had simply been used as bait.

They were the prodigious king tiers of the younger generation, yet they had actually fallen to the level of mere bait?
