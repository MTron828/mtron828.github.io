Chapter 2234: Storm secretly brewing

Since poison could not kill it, they would use a tonic to replace the poison.

That sounded very ridiculous, but in this new heaven and earth where Regulations were chaotic, it could very possibly happen.

Ling Han pondered for a while, and then shook his head. “No, no. Though that poison has become a tonic for it, it does not mean that a tonic would definitely become poison for it. Because there are too many Regulations, who knows which Regulation here should correspond to the Regulation of Poison.”

The Rain Emperor and the others thought for a while, and nodded as well.

Perhaps it was the Regulation of Metal that corresponded to the Regulation of Poison here, or it might be Water, Lightning, or other Regulations. This was a new heaven and earth with new Regulations.

“Then what do we do? Try them one after another?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked, unwilling to abandon the matter.

Ling Han shook his head. “Concocting a cauldron’s worth of poison pills has already expended much of my resources. If we were to test them all one after another, our wealth would not suffice at all.”

“Then what do we do?”

“I got it!” Ling Han suddenly clapped his hands once. “We will continue to feed poison pills to this guy.”

“Oh no, Niu’s Ling Han has gone mad!” Hu Niu stroked Ling Han’s head. “To the great monster, that would be a tonic.”

Ling Han smilingly answered, “I know.”

The Empress and the Rain Emperor immediately understood, and nodded as they said, “I understand now.”

“What have you guys understood?” Bewitching Maiden Rou’s expression was completely filled with bafflement. What she hated the most was when people spoke in riddles in front of her.

Ling Han did not keep her hanging, because Hu Niu was here. Anyone who kept the little girl hanging had to prepare themselves for her going on berserk. He said, “This cauldron of poison pills can be considered to have very obvious effects on that monster, and its cultivation level has greatly advanced.”

“That’s right, so why do we still have to give it more?” Bewitching Maiden Rou blinked her eyes, puzzlement still on her face.

Ling Han laughed, and replied, “But don’t forget. There is a restriction on cultivation level here. Even if a Celestial King wanted to force his way in, it would only result in his body bursting and subsequent death.”

Now that Ling Han had said this, the Bewitching Maiden Rou also finally understood, and said, “Oh, so you are planning to stuff this monster till it bursts?”

This monster could improve its cultivation level through feeding on poison pills, but there was a restriction on cultivation level here. Once its cultivation level passed that limit, its fate would be going off with?pa—exploding.

Even if this monster had been nurtured by the heaven and earth, and could enjoy some “privileges,” it still had to bear the restrictions. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In the heaven and earth, there had to be rules to adhere to.

“Let’s go. We’ll go back and buy more ingredients, and continue to concoct alchemical pills.”

They returned to base camp. The Rain Emperor and the others put forward their respective cultivation resources, and went into the city’s trade market to trade for the ingredients they needed for the poison pills.

Clear Heaven Pass was very big. Though its natural resources were scarce, because there were things like the remains of elites of the Foreign Realm, it actually did not lack resources for cultivation, because these remains were extremely useful, and could be refined into alchemical pills, precious tools, and so on.

Especially after the students of Saintly Origin Academy had come, the trade market had also become incredibly prosperous. On the one hand, they had brought the plentiful materials of the Celestial Realm, and on the other hand, there were such unique raw materials like the remains of elites of the Foreign Realm.

Ling Han arrived at the market, yet discovered to his surprise that the beast flesh from the neutral zone had also been put up for sale here. Furthermore, their effects were clearly indicated—they could replenish the power of Regulation.

This incited great commotion, and wealthy people threw away money recklessly, fighting fiercely to buy it.

A newly created world had formed. Even if it was pitifully small, it still contained enormous, great fortune.

The various great forces were actually all eyeing this, but because the neutral zone restricted the levels of elites, everyone could only sit by and watch.

And what was the most important? No one had seen the formation of a new world, and observed this process. This would be extremely helpful for them to understand the formation of the Celestial Realm, and this problem indicated straight at the core of Regulations, or might even have surpassed Regulations per se.

So how important was this?

Thus, the beast meat that could replenish Regulations was naturally hot-selling. Its significance and value were really too enormous.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. Before him, there had to have been others who had discovered the great use of the beast meat. After all, he had entered later, but they, like him, had chosen to get rich quietly, and earn a great profit before the news had been spread.

However, there was no concealing the truth. With someone selling beast flesh, this secret would naturally be exposed.

He could imagine that by tomorrow, no, today, there would be countless people surging into the neutral zone, and beginning a mad hunting spree.

Moreover, since the Celestial Realm had discovered this fact, how could it be that the Foreign Realm would be ignorant of that?

The intensity of the competition could possibly surpass everyone’s expectations.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered about this. He first bought all the materials that were needed, then returned to base camp, and continued concocting poison pills.

Clear Heaven Pass, inside a massive stone castle.

The Encompassing Age Celestial King sat high above. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and was already stationed here several epochs ago. He also possessed a powerful force in Clear Heaven Pass.

In truth, the number of Celestial Kings in Clear Heaven Pass was definitely the highest in the entire Celestial Realm. If this power suddenly surged into the Celestial Realm, the power structure of the Celestial Realm would definitely experience a revolutionary change.

However, to oppose the Foreign Realm, the Celestial Kings had reached an agreement. Every Celestial King could only stay outside for a certain period of time, after which they had to come to Clear Heaven Pass and serve. Of course, after achieving some great merit, they could still return to the Celestial Realm, and enjoy a period of peace before returning.

However, most Celestial Kings had sprouted roots here.

Why?

Because it was possible that there was a chance to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier here. The clash of the two Realms could possibly lead to a gap, allowing them to surpass the Celestial King Tier, and ascend to Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Around the Encompassing Age Celestial King, his seven sons were seated, and they were known as the Seven Kings of the Chang Clan. They were all Celestial Kings, each more excellent than the last. The eldest was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, and the youngest was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, who was not too far away from Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

“Father, we should make some plans about that neutral zone as well,” the fifth son of the Chang Clan said.

The Encompassing Age Celestial King’s eyes were closed, with him sitting as still as a statue.

The Seven Kings of the Chang Clan were all accustomed to this appearance of their father. The eldest said loudly, “With the heaven and earth newly created, we could observe the earliest Dao, which would be helpful for us to step out of the Celestial King Tier, and progress towards Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“It is probable that those beings have advanced into the Heavenly Venerable Tier like this as well, isn’t it?” the second son of the Chang Clan asked.

At this time, the Encompassing Age Celestial King suddenly opened his eyes, and the Seven Kings of the Chang Clan immediately fell silent.

“I have made a prediction, and there is great fortune in this heaven and earth,” the Encompassing Age Celestial King said. After his eyes were open, celestial light shone in all directions, as if he could see the future.

“Father, then what should we do?” the third son of the Chang Clan asked.

“Try to occupy as much territory as possible,” the Encompassing Age Celestial King said. “However, there are many forces that are targeting that place. All of you are to do as much as you can, but do not be too deliberate. Now is not yet the time for an all-out competition.”

The Seven Kings of the Chang Clan all nodded, and answered respectfully, “Yes, Father!”

On the banks of a lake, the waters rippled brightly. An old man was presently fishing, while a young man stood behind him, bowing and standing solemnly.

“Feicheng, that new heaven and earth is about to truly open. A great fortune lies within. At present, I cannot enter yet, so it is up to you to go and make preliminary arrangements,” the old man said calmly, his eyes closed.

“Understood,” the young man replied respectfully.

His name was Meng Feicheng, and he was one of the many disciples of this old man. He was also the youngest of them, as well as the one who had the brightest future prospects.

“Fortune is in the grasp of the heavens and in one’s own hands. I have predicted that a core could possibly be created in this new world. If one can obtain it, one could possibly obtain the secrets of Source Power of the Regulations of the heaven and earth.”

Meng Feicheng looked excited. “This disciple will definitely obtain the Core of the heaven and earth for Master.”

The old man nodded, and said, “Go on. I have confidence in you.”

“Understood!”
