3111 Attending the Banquet

Ling Han accepted the invitation, and the young man revealed a strange smile as he turned to leave.

“Wait,” Ling Han said. After the young man stopped, he asked, “How should I address you?”

The young man turned around with an unhappy expression. “I’m your senior brother. When you speak to a senior brother, you should add the word ‘please’! Forget it, you’ve just entered the sect. I won’t blame you this time.

“My surname is Pang, full name Pang Anhe.”

Ling Han ignored him, and only lowered his head to look at the invitation.

F*ck.

Pang Anhe instantly felt like he had thrown a punch into a ball of wool[1]. This disregard made him so angry that he was about to explode.

In a fit of anger, he even had the impulse to make a move. However, he recalled how Ling Han was the Lord Sect Master’s most favored disciple, so even if anyone wanted to mess with him, how could he possibly jump out and be the first one?

Forget it. In any case, Ling Han wouldn’t be smug for very long.

With a flourish of his sleeves, he left.

Huan Xue escorted the guest out. The smile on her face had long disappeared as she glared at Pang Anhe.

Right now, she wished she had the power to punch this bastard to death. How dared he disrespect her young master.

‘Just you wait, I’ll remember this.’

Ling Han didn’t care at all. In the past, there had been plenty of proud prodigies who had put on airs and acted like big shots in front of him, but hadn’t all of them been beaten into retards and slaughtered like weak chickens by him?

‘He Miaoyin, the granddaughter of Seventh Elder He Guan. No wonder there is such a big fuss over her 18th birthday.

‘He Guan had advanced to Ten Meridians 20 years ago, and became the last elder of the Ancient Dao Sect. His current cultivation level is… unknown.

‘Although Sun Jianfang treats me well, this has also aroused the jealousy of many people. To invite me to a banquet at this time, heh heh, most of those attending probably don’t have good intentions.

‘Forget it, I’ll go take a look.’

There were still four days before He Miaoyin’s birthday banquet, and Ling Han continued to practice the Demonic Monkey Fists while giving Huan Xue some pointers.

Even though Huan Xue’s talent wasn’t high, her current cultivation didn’t require much natural talent, either. As long as she could sense her meridians, all that was left for her to do was to work hard.

This was especially true for One Meridian. One only had to achieve 250 kg of strength, and Huan Xue wasn’t a prodigy, so 250 kg of strength was indeed her limit. With the support of the Spirit Gathering Formation, she had already completed the cultivation of One Meridian by the third day.

After taking the three Meridian Guiding Pills, she sensed her second meridian, successfully opened the second meridian, and entered the level of Two Meridians.

By the fourth day, she already had 350 kg of strength. This was simply shocking.

Only Ling Han would be so generous as to spend so many resources on a person with no natural talent. One had to know that six Meridian Guiding Pills were enough to produce a Six Meridians.

If others were to find out, they would definitely scold Ling Han for being wasteful. He was extravagant to the point of speechlessness.

Meanwhile, Ling Han’s strength had increased from 4000 kg to 5000 kg. This advancement was much faster than Huan Xue’s, and he was comparable to a peak-stage Six Meridians. And he had only opened up his fifth meridian at this point.

He realized that his physique was rapidly becoming stronger.

The Precious Fruits that he had eaten previously should have been completely digested, and no longer had any effect, right?

Why was his physique still rapidly improving? It didn’t make sense.

He thought for a long time, and felt that this was the effect of the unknown cultivation technique.

Brother Monkey had said that there were many advantages to it. Enhancing one’s physique should be one of them.

However, Ling Han could not keep calling it the unknown cultivation technique, right?

‘Hmm, I’ll call it Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique.’

Ling Han nodded. If the Empress and the others knew about this, they would definitely say that no matter where this fellow was, he was still as incompetent at naming as ever.

“Huan Xue, let’s go.” Seeing that it was getting late, Ling Han beckoned to his little handmaiden.

“Huan Xue can go too?” Huan Xue was excited. With her status, she was not qualified to attend events like banquets, unless it was Ling Han that held a banquet. Then, as a servant, she could attend, but she would also be working.

Ling Han nodded. With his protective personality, since Huan Xue was one of his people, she was more noble than anyone else in his eyes.

“Alright, Young Master. Huan Xue will go change immediately.” Huan Xue ran off in a flash.

The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched slightly. As expected, as long as it was a woman, she would love to look beautiful. Wasn’t it just going to attend a banquet? Did she need to specially change her clothes?

After a while, Huan Xue appeared. She had changed into a clean red dress, and a small white bag was slung over her shoulder. Her face was slightly powdered, making her look even fairer. Her red lips were rosy and bright, and her eyes had somehow grown larger.

This makeup, tsk, tsk.

If Huan Xue could originally be considered a beauty worth 70 marks, then she was now at least a beauty worth 80 marks. This makeup really wasn’t wasted on her.

“Young Master…” Huan Xue was a little embarrassed to be stared at by her young master.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han smiled and took the lead. Huan Xue hurriedly followed behind him. She didn’t dare to walk alongside Ling Han, and instead fell a step behind, bearing in mind her position as a maid.

However, Ling Han had just stepped out of the door when he stopped.

“Young Master?”

Ling Han smiled awkwardly. “Where does He Miaoyin live?”

Pfft, Huan Xue immediately laughed. This young master was really interesting.

She didn’t dare to tease him, and quickly pointed the way. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The two of them left. The Ancient Dao Sect was actually very large. Most of the buildings here had appeared after the earthquake—they were products of the previous civilization. However, there were also some that were built now and imitated the ancient style, but because they were too new, they could be clearly distinguished with a glance.

After walking for about 20 minutes, they arrived in front of a large courtyard.

This was obviously a newly built structure because it was huge.

The ancient buildings were all small courtyards, but this one was at least five times larger, and the paint on the exterior walls and such was very new.

At the door, two servants were welcoming guests. They were wearing very strange clothes, with the ends of their clothes resembling a swallow’s tail. They also wore a cloth collar.

Ling Han learned about the civilization from 100 years ago from the optical computer. Those clothes were called tuxedos, and they were only worn by high-class families when they held banquets. The cloth collars around their necks were called bow ties, and there was another type called ties, which was similar to this, but a long strip of cloth would hang down from it, making it even stranger.

There were many guests entering, most of them in pairs. The men were basically dressed in a suit, while the women’s clothes were of all kinds and varieties. Some of them even revealed their fair thighs and backs, and even their chests were almost half-exposed, which made Ling Han very surprised.

The women here… were really too open.

Ling Han walked over and handed over the invitation. A servant took it, and immediately made a gesture to invite him in. “So it’s Young Master Ling. Please.”

Ling Han went first, and Huan Xue hurriedly followed, appearing extremely cautious. Although she was already a cultivator, she still couldn’t change her mentality of a servant for the moment.

“Hahaha, what a joke. Someone actually brought a maid over.” Immediately, a young man laughed loudly. The female companion beside him also covered her mouth and chuckled, appearing very reserved in her amusement. However, the disdainful gaze she shot at Huan Xue already showed her attitude.
