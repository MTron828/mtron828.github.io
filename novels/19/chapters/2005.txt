Chapter 2006: Killing Ma Tongguang

Weng, weng, weng. One after another, the seals on the scroll lit up, incredibly bright and ablaze.

After reaching the pinnacle, xiu, xiu, xiu, these seals actually flew out of the scroll, and turned into multiple human figures. They were all as tall as nine meters, their bodies exuding a fiery white light.

Seven seals turned into seven warriors, each and every one of them majestic and awe-inspiring.

Initially, Ma Tongguang would only use a single seal every time, but now he was already deeply aware of how strong Ling Han was. Thus, he had directly activated all seven of the Celestial King seals.

The motive was very simple, and that was to kill Ling Han. He definitely did not want any unexpected accidents to happen.

“En, quite interesting.” Ling Han stepped out. With a tremor from his figure, a human figure walked out from his body. It was the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul.

“Kill him!” Ma Tongguang pointed at Ling Han.

He had initially wanted to get Ling Han killed only after Ling Han went to the Western Celestial Realm, but now his fury was raging, and he had no further desire to wait any longer.

‘Die! Die! Die!’

Seven light warriors surrounded Ling Han. They were all human figures, but their faces were completely indiscernible. Their facial features were all blurred.

Boom!

The light warriors moved at the same time, charging towards Ling Han.

The two Ling Hans greeted the assault simultaneously. Peng, peng, peng, the battle suddenly became incredibly intense.

Just what difference would arise from using different grades of Yang Soul Stones to break through?

If it was purple grade, the divided soul would be able to reach the absolute perfect level of battle prowess of the original, and for indigo grade, it would be 90%, and so on. Finally, when a Dividing Soul Tier broke through to the Immortal Palace Tier, they would return to the original. Thus, the stronger the divided souls were, the stronger battle prowess would naturally be upon breaking through to the Immortal Palace Tier.

In another aspect, the higher the grade of Yang Soul Stone, the stronger one’s strength would be at Yang Soul level.

This was like two rivers that were of the same length, but one was wide, while the other was narrow. In that case, which one had more water?

The two Ling Hans had equal battle prowess, and were mentally connected. If it were not for the fact that one of them contained the Black Tower inside his body, there was practically no difference between the original and the divided soul.

Peng, the two Ling Hans battled the seven light figures, the scene incredibly intense.

“Who has the upper hand?” someone asked from afar.

“Not clear.” The person beside him shook his head.

It indeed could not be seen clearly. Both Ling Han and the light warriors’ strength soared to early stage Heaven Soul’s level, far surpassing ordinary Dividing Soul Tiers, so who could discern it clearly?

Yet the Empress and Hu Niu showed a smile. They naturally could see clearly that Ling Han and the light warriors were actually tied. However, Ling Han was a real cultivator, and had endless strength, while the light warriors were manifested from Celestial King Tier seals, so how long could they last?

Ling Han would definitely win this battle.

Ultimately, Ma Tongguang was a monarch tier. He, too, could tell that the light warriors could not suppress Ling Han, and this stunned him incredibly.

That was a Celestial King Tier technique, and could easily suppress Earth Soul-level elites, while Ling Han had only just advanced into the Dividing Soul Tier. Even if he was a monarch tier, and could be invincible even with a gap of two levels, Ling Han should still be losing no matter what in a clash of seven against two.

Ma Tongguang was very clear. This Celestial King Tier technique could only last for about two hours. If Ling Han still could not be killed within two hours, there would be no further opportunity.

Gritting his teeth, Ma Tongguang also sent out his own doppelganger, which charged to attack Ling Han. Even if he was no match for Ling Han, he was also a noble Ma Tongguang, so how could his strength be underestimated?

Boom!

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul’s whole body began to burn with blazing flames. After it had gained its independence, the Nine Heavens Flame was also able to completely release its own might.

This was the difference between him and the original Ling Han, and could be considered as the great ultimate move of a divided soul.

Fiery flames burned the heaven and earth, and the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul greatly displayed his might, blocking all seven light warriors single-handedly.

Ling Han took the opportunity to charge towards Ma Tongguang. There was no meaning to continue the battle with the seven light warriors. Killing Ma Tongguang was the real priority.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Without the light warriors restraining him, how could Ma Tongguang possibly be a match for Ling Han. He was completely at a disadvantage, and blood sprayed endlessly from his body. He would probably be killed within the next 100 moves.

“Protect me!” Ma Tongguang’s heart shivered in fear, and he no longer dared to clash directly with Ling Han. They were both monarch tiers, but the gulf between the two of them was actually so wide.

The seven light warriors immediately charged towards Ling Han to clear a route through which Ma Tongguang could flee.

Indeed, with the mad siege of the seven great light warriors, Ling Han was trapped, and could not launch an attack at Ma Tongguang. This caused a flash of pleasure to show on Ma Tongguang’s face, and he hurriedly turned and fled.

As he was fleeing, a strong feeling of humiliation rose up in him. He was a noble monarch tier, and had even used a Celestial King Tier rare treasure, and yet he could only flee piteously. This was a great humiliation that he had never experienced before.

When he returned to the Western Celestial Realm, he would definitely murder Ling Han in revenge for this.

Ling Han only smiled slightly. He had indeed been restrained, but Ma Tongguang had also forgotten one thing, and that was he was no longer a fifth severance, but rather a Dividing Soul Tier elite.

This meant that he still had a divided soul!

Xiu, the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul charged out. The seven light warriors were all focused on blocking Ling Han, so they naturally could not stop the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul as well. This Ling Han charged out without any obstruction, and shot out a punch at Ma Tongguang’s back.

“No!” Ma Tongguang exclaimed, and hurriedly turned around to parry. However, because he was fully concentrated on fleeing, how could he possibly manage to turn around in time?

Peng, the punch landed, and flames filled the skies. One of the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul’s fists had already penetrated through Ma Tongguang’s chest.

Ma Tongguang’s eyes were blank. He lowered his head slightly to look at his chest, and a disbelieving expression appeared on his face. He opened his mouth to say something, but with a tilt of his head, he was already completely dead.

Just how frightening was the destructive power of the Nine Heavens Flame? His heart had been directly exploded, so how could he possibly still be alive?

Lu Xianming couldn’t help but shudder in fear. Ma Tongguang was a representative of the Western Celestial Realm, and Ling Han had still killed him without any mercy. In comparison, what was Lu Xianming even worth? The latter was just a Two-Star Alchemist and a former Holy Son, so how could he compare to Ma Tongguang?

Just at this moment, the seven light warriors flashed, and suddenly disappeared.

Time was up.

Ling Han strode towards Lu Xianming, his eyes cold. “Lu Xianming, as you have had some accomplishments in alchemy, I ignored some of your little actions. But you have repeatedly provoked me, and that was only seeking your own death.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“No, you cannot kill me, I, too, am a citizen of Alchemy City!” Lu Xianming shouted.

“This is cleaning the house!” Ling Han shot out a punch. Bang, Lu Xianming directly burst, and turned into a shower of blood.

Ling Han clapped his hands, looking relaxed.

“Let’s go, let’s go, this place isn’t fun at all!” Hu Niu urged.

Ling Han nodded, and the four of them continued their advance.

“Having killed an envoy from the Western Celestial Realm, can you deal with it?” the Empress asked.

“I’ll deal with whatever comes. Who asked that guy to repeatedly want to make a move on me, and even dare to have ideas about you girls?” Ling Han said with extreme displeasure.

The Empress nodded, and did not say anything further.

She was an incredibly proud person, and thought that everyone in the world should worship her. If Ling Han killed an insignificant person, so what?

“Niu will protect Ling Han!” Hu Niu clung onto one of Ling Han’s arms.

“So lovey-dovey!” A laugh rang out behind Ling Han and his group.

Instantly, Ling Han’s fighting spirit blazed. Slowly, he turned around, and spat out word by word, “Ji Wuming!”
