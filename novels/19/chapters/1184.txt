Chapter 1185: Shameless Ginseng

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Even if her opponent was only ginseng, it was clear that Shen Zhu’er still wouldn’t allow it to grope her breasts. She hurriedly formed an Origin Power shield to protect herself.

Pu!

The old ginseng unleashed a beam of Regulation light that slashed her Origin Power shield apart. Pieces of silk cloth flew into the air as the chest area of Shen Zhu’er’s silk dress was ripped into shreds. However, much to the old ginseng’s disappointment, what he1 saw wasn’t Shen Zhu’er’s shapely breasts. Rather, he was met with the sight of a golden duduo2.

“Are these the fabled golden breasts1?”

The old ginseng drooled as he leered at Shen Zhu’er’s breasts.

However, he was a Spiritual Herb, so his drool released an especially fragrant and refreshing smell. It could be said that his drool was also great medicine.

“Brat, you actually dare to look as well?!”

The old ginseng seethed with rage as he charged toward Ling Han.

“B-bastard!” Shen Zhu’er trembled in anger. She was one of the six king tiers, yet she was actually being teased by a mere ginseng! How could she not be furious?

Fortunately, she was still wearing a treasure-grade dudou. Otherwise, her breasts really would have been revealed.

She was beside herself with rage, and terrifying divine chains formed in the air as she waved her slender hands. They shot toward the old ginseng, and it was clear that she wasn’t planning to capture him alive anymore. It was only ginseng, after all, so it could still be eaten even if it were beaten into a pulp. Doing so would only affect its medicinal effects slightly.

“Big-breasted lady, why are you chasing after your grandpa ginseng?” The old ginseng continued to tease Shen Zhu’er as he dodged her attacks, saying, “That brat also looked at your big breasts, so why aren’t you attacking him?”

He was even complaining about his mistreatment.

“Die!” Shen Zhu’er yelled in a shrill voice.

She was a king tier of the younger generation, and she should have been calm and composed. However, this old ginseng was far too provocative, and she already was boiling with rage after just two or three exchanges. She was hell-bent on smashing him into 10,000 pieces.

“Sigh, grandpa ginseng is far too handsome. This big-breasted lady loves me so much that she even wants to kill me! That way, she can eat me and be with me forever!” There was a profoundly narcissistic expression on the old ginseng’s face, and he said, “It’s truly a crime to be as handsome as me!”

Ling Han felt like he was about to vomit. He teamed up with Shen Zhu’er, and shouted, “Despicable ginseng, I’ve never seen anything as shameless as you before!”

“Of course! Grandpa ginseng is one of a kind!” the old ginseng said smugly. However, he instantly flared up in rage, and said, “You dare to scold your grandpa?”

This old ginseng was truly detestable. Everything that he said was offensive and provocative.

“Nets of Heaven and Earth!” Shen Zhu’er shouted. The power of Regulations intertwined together with her Origin Power to form a gigantic net.

At the same time, Ling Han also unleashed his Crimson Ground Locking Net toward the old ginseng.

Upon seeing his paths of retreat being cut off, the old ginseng immediately tunneled into the ground.

Xiu!

He disappeared in a flash.

He was a ginseng that had grown in the soil, and his ability to travel underground hadn’t disappeared after he had gained intelligence and the ability to cultivate. Instead, his ability to travel underground had become even stronger.

‘He’s gone...’

Xiu!

Just as they thought that he had disappeared, the old ginseng instantly popped up from the ground. Being the despicable ginseng that he was, he actually popped up between Shen Zhu’er’s feet and dashed toward her abdomen.

“Die!”

Shen Zhu’er was absolutely furious. Her raven black hair billowed violently in the air, and divine light pulsed from her body, transforming into sheets of ice.

“Ahhh! You’re freezing your grandpa to death!”

The old ginseng was frozen into a heap, and he fell to the ground with a thud. However, before Ling Han or Shen Zhu’er could capture him, he hurriedly tunneled into the ground again. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was stunned. Although Shen Zhu’er was being picked on by the old ginseng, this didn’t change the fact that she was incredibly powerful. The might of her ice attack was tremendous, and Ling Han estimated that there was an 80% chance that he would be frozen if he were to face such an attack head-on.

Even if he wasn’t wounded, Shen Zhu’er could seize the opportunity to bind him with divine chains or even kill his friends and family.

King tiers couldn’t be underestimated!

“Big-breasted lady, remember not to wear pants under your dress next time. Your grandpa wasn’t able to see anything!”

The old ginseng popped up in the distance, not daring to near Shen Zhu’er. It was clear that he was afraid of her attacks.

Shen Zhu’er remained silent as she stared at the old ginseng. She waved an arm, and an expanse of ice instantly spread toward the old ginseng.

“Grandpa ginseng’s done playing with you guys!”

The old ginseng hurriedly bore into the ground and fled.

He was indeed quick, yet his battle prowess was far weaker than that of Shen Zhu’er and Ling Han. If he faced them head-on, he would merely be seeking death. Moreover, Ling Han hadn’t unleashed his divine patterns of flame only because he hadn’t wanted to wound the Godly medicine.

Shen Zhu’er was boiling with anger. So be it if she hadn’t obtained that Godly medicine. However, she had actually been teased and played with like a fool! She had never experienced such humiliation before.

“That despicable ginseng can’t be underestimated,” Ling Han said. “Not only is it a high-grade Godly medicine, it even managed to develop intelligence after living for countless years. Moreover, it can use the Regulations of heaven and earth. It’s genuinely achieved dao.”

Shen Zhu’er, who wore a furious expression, said, “Who cares if he’s achieved the dao or not? I’m definitely going to kill him!”

Her breasts had almost been revealed, so she didn’t have the face to stay there any longer. She nodded at Ling Han before turning around to leave.

“How fun!” Hu Feiyun said, a bright glimmer in her eyes.

“You wouldn’t be laughing if that despicable ginseng targeted you,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. That old ginseng was far too quick, and perhaps only Sun Moon Tier elites would be able to capture him.

“Let’s go!”

Ling Han resolutely let go of his desire for the Godly medicine. There was no point in wasting time if he couldn’t capture it.

They climbed down the medicinal mountain. As they did so, Ling Han thought about how great it would be if this mystery realm were completely opened. That way, he would have enough time to place all of the Godly medicines in this place into his Black Tower. However, if someone were truly powerful enough to open this mystery realm, would they really leave any treasures for others?

It wasn’t peaceful inside this mystery realm. There were all kinds of Demonic Beasts here, and they all fought against one another. They also ate humans.

Ling Han and the others were attacked by wave after wave of Demonic Beasts. However, they were all killed and placed into the Black Tower by Ling Han. These Demonic Beasts would become their food.

He had a huge stock of Spiritual Meat, and he would enjoy it daily with Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun. He could feel his stamina improving.

Several more days passed, and another mountain appeared before them.

However, Ling Han didn’t believe that this was a naturally formed mountain. This was because this mountain was in the shape of a soaring eagle, with each detail being very clear.

‘Is this formed from some dead Demonic Bird?’

Immortal level Demonic Beasts could reach tens of thousands of meters in height. Thus, it was possible that the “eagle mountain” before them was formed from a Demonic Bird, even though it was remarkably tall.

In any case, this was the most competitive region of the entire mystery realm.

This was because Thousand Source True Fluid would appear here!

When the sun and moon crossed paths every day, a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid would fall from the beak of the Demonic Bird, leading to huge and violent skirmishes. However, Thousand Source True Fluid would only appear approximately three months after the mystery realm had opened. Moreover, it would only appear for 10 consecutive days.

This mystery realm had opened hundreds of times in the past tens of thousands of years, so everyone was naturally aware of this. People speculated that some sort of change would occur when this mystery realm was opened, and it was this change that would gradually lead to the formation of Thousand Source True Fluid.

As for the specifics, no one knew.

Ling Han calculated how long they had been here, and he found that there were still a few days until the three-month mark.

He looked the mountain up and down. He suddenly felt an urge to run over and check it out.
