3008 Weakness

When this attack came, Lin Luo and the others hurriedly parried.

At the same time, Xin Qihu and the other Sixth Tiers broke into a run and fled. They didn’t even have the courage to withstand a single strike.

This wasn’t because they lacked courage. Rather, it was because they would definitely die if they faced this attack head-on.

Hysteria’s strength had already surpassed the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, and could even be considered to have reached the Eighth Tier. Without cultivating an indestructible body, taking it head-on would definitely result in death.

Yet Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains acted as if he had not seen anything, and was still attacking Ling Han madly.

He knew that he would not be able to kill Ling Han, but the hope that he had been anticipating endlessly had suddenly shattered. How could he suppress the fury in his heart?

In any case, he had an indestructible body, so what did it matter that he was wilful?

Moreover, since his hope had already been extinguished, how could he still have any intention of opposing Hysteria?

What did it matter whether the Genesis World was destroyed or not? What did it have to do with him?

Peng!

Hysteria’s attack landed, and all the Seventh Tiers were sent flying. No one could face it head-on. After swallowing the Flaming Frost Realm, Hysteria’s strength had reached the point that it could crush the combined power of all the Seventh Tiers.

Pu! Ling Han couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He couldn’t help but feel shocked. The defense that he had cultivated was capable of withstanding several hundred attacks from a Seventh Tier, but with a single blow from Hysteria, it immediately shattered.

The strength of Hysteria was unimaginable.

“En?” Shatter Mountains’s gaze swept over, and he couldn’t help but reveal a cold smirk. “So, it turns out that you are not truly immortal and indestructible.”

He had also suffered the attack of Hysteria, but had only been sent flying. His body itself was unwounded.

But in Ling Han’s case?

His face had clearly turned pale, and he had even spat out blood.

This was definitely not a genuine undying body.

“I understand now. Your defense is only super strong. As long as this limit is not broken, you will be able to endlessly replenish this defense, but if the power is overwhelming enough, this defense will not be able to withstand a single blow,” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said. This was basically accurate. As expected of an ultimate elite of Seventh Tier.

“Since you’re not immortal, just die!”

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains charged over again, slashing with both hands, and condensing the six fundamental powers, which turned into indestructible sharp blades.

Ling Han humphed, and brandished his fists in a furious counterattack.

Boom!

The two people exchanged blows. A powerful shock wave reverberated out, yet neither was wounded.

Ling Han had already set up his defenses again. This kind of impact was naturally no big deal.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains narrowed his eyes. Though he had seen through the weakness of Ling Han’s defense, seeing through it was one matter, and being able to break through it was another.

Truth be told, he couldn’t break through it.

However… Hysteria could.

He immediately had an idea. When Hysteria delivered another attack, he would hold Ling Han back so that Ling Han would not have the chance to escape.

Peng, under the crushing force, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was naturally sent flying, but not only was Ling Han sent flying, he was even throwing up blood continuously, looking quite terrible.

“Hahaha, brat, I’ll take your life!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains charged back, and the six fundamental powers turned into a battle spear that ruthlessly stabbed towards Ling Han.

Ling Han frowned upon seeing this. He wasn’t afraid of Shatter Mountains, but Hysteria was far too powerful, so much so that it could penetrate his defenses. Thus, he would be at a huge disadvantage if he started a battle here.

He very much wanted to kill Chong Yan and his group, but to say nothing of the fact that his physique had not reached the true level of indestructibility, even if it had, he would not have been able to suppress Chong Yan and his group.

Hence, if they continued to fight, it would be meaningless.

He should leave.

At present, his main priority was still to increase his cultivation level. As long as he advanced to the Sixth Tier, he would definitely be able to defeat Shatter Mountains and the other bastards, and if he advanced to the Seventh Tier, even if his power was not enough to kill these five people, it would be more than enough to suppress them.

Once he had made up his mind, he turned around and left without hesitation.

Shua, Hysteria, however, clearly planned to kill Ling Han here as well. A long tentacle flew over, bringing with it an incomparably terrifying might.

Ling Han ran quickly, but Shatter Mountains charged towards him from the sidelines, brandishing his battle spear to stab at Ling Han.

This couldn’t hurt him, but it was enough to stop him, allowing Hysteria to wield the true executioner’s blade.

‘F***, so despicable!’ Ling Han thought. Shatter Mountains had actually “joined forces” with Hysteria to persecute him. He was truly shameless to the extreme.

Shua, a figure appeared, blocking in front of Ling Han. Then, he moved, meeting Hysteria’s attack.

Lin Luo.

Peng.

Without any suspense, Lin Luo couldn’t block this blow at all, and was immediately sent flying. However, with this block, the power of this blow finally decreased sharply, and when it hit Ling Han’s body, the power had decreased several hundred times.

Ling Han was sent flying, but this time he was completely unscathed.

Others might not know, but Ling Han himself knew. The defense on his body had weakened by close to 90%.

Which also meant that even if Hysteria’s might was weakened a few hundred times, it still possessed the ability to threaten him.

“Senior Lin, Senior Zhou, Senior Chu, I’ll take my leave first!” Ling Han said. However, he didn’t slow down in the slightest, moving as quick as lightning.

If he stayed here, he would be in great danger.

“Die!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains also set out in a rapid pursuit, but was again blocked by Lin Luo.

Chong Yan and the others were hot in pursuit, while Bai Fan, Xin Fu, and Heavenly Venerate Blood Rainbow joined forces to stop the four ultimate elites. All of them were undying and indestructible, and attacked without any reservations.

As for Ten Thousand Shadows and Golden Silk Moth?

To say nothing of Zhou Heng and Chu Hao, even if they weren’t there, would they dare to target Ling Han?

Especially so for Golden Silk Moth—the shadow in his heart was as large as a mountain. Ten Thousand Shadows’s first reaction upon seeing Ling Han was to turn around and run.

With such a block, Ling Han naturally escaped.

Shua, but the most terrifying was still Hysteria. When a tentacle waved out, it was more terrifying than anything else.

Ling Han didn’t take it head-on. Ling Han unleashed all of his power, and pushed it to the extreme.

He was running in front, while a long tentacle was pursuing him from behind. It was as if there was no limit to it, and it could stretch out endlessly, right until it reached him.

The distance between the two was slowly narrowing.

Whether in the Void or a dimension, Hysteria’s speed and power were number one in the world, and there was no other that could match it.

Ling Han’s expression did not change in the slightest. His expression was solemn, and he merely concentrated on running quickly.

Ahead of them, the passageway to the Realm Battlefield had appeared.

Once he entered it, he would be in the territory of the Profound Negative Realm. It would have a massive suppression on Hysteria and greatly weaken its power. At that time, it would not be difficult for Ling Han to take another blow from Hysteria.

When he was less than five kilometers away from that passage, Hysteria’s attack reached him. Its tentacle surpassed him slightly, and then struck backward harshly.

Not only did this strike possess frightening might, it was also going to send Ling Han into the Realm Battlefield.

Obviously, Hysteria also knew that if Ling Han escaped into the Profound Negative Realm, it would no longer be able to kill this young man.

Ling Han did not enter into the Void. That was the main battlefield of Hysteria. Before he could tear another rip into the Void, he would definitely be entangled by Hysteria, right until his death.

He roared loudly, and his figure shot up quickly.
