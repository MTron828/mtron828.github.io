Chapter 885: Depending on You

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Yi, I couldn’t tell, but you do have a bit of ability!” The young girl appeared surprised.

The difference of a single Star of Shattering Void Tier meant a world of difference, and in the Immortal Realm, this applied as well. Starting from nine Stars of Shattering Void Tier, there were pitifully few that had more than ten Stars of battle prowess, and fourteen Stars was yet another great barrier.

If there was one in a hundred that could reach battle prowess above ten Stars of Shattering Void Tier, then there was at most only one in ten thousand that could achieve fifteen Stars of battle prowess.

Although the young girl had not given it her all, her casual strike was still at least worth thirteen to fourteen Stars of battle prowess, but the other party was actually able to match her evenly, which naturally caused her to feel slightly shocked.

“Again!” Her competitive spirit had been incited, and she immediately started to deliver a rain of attacks on Ling Han.

Ling Han, as one who had lived two lifetimes, knew that this kind of young miss was not someone to trifle with. It would be all right if he lost, but if he won, she would definitely not drop the matter. However, he also had his pride, so why was there a need for him to lose? Thus, he casually parried and blocked, maintaining the situation in which neither of them had the upper hand.

After repetitive unsuccessful attacks, the young girl’s temper flared up, and she no longer thought about withholding her power. As her hands flew out in blows, she gave it her full effort, determined to defeat Ling Han.

Unfortunately, Ling Han had presently reached sixteen Stars merely in pure strength alone, and as the saying went, a physically strong person would be able to defeat ten opponents skilled in technique, so even if he did not use any technique, he was able to suppress her fully.

Ling Han naturally would not do that. He merely maintained the stalemate, and even allowed the young girl to feel as if she was slightly having the upper hand, though she was still unable to completely dominate him.

The space in the Immortal Realm was indeed sturdy. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yet Ling Han’s thoughts had strayed elsewhere; if two great elites with battle prowess of sixteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier fought it out in the lower realm, then he presumed that not just this garden, but even the whole Point Star City would undoubtedly explode.

But now? The waves of power they created actually just shook a few tree leaves in the garden, just as if they had returned to the Body Refining Tier.

Peng, peng, peng. The two people fought vigorously, but it was practically the young girl on the attack, whereas Ling Han was purely on defense. Good men would not fight with women, so what could he prove by winning against this young girl? Presently, Ling Han only wanted to defeat the five sects and the Ao Clan, whereas in the future, he wished to surpass the elites of the Roc Palace.

“Weiwei, stop.” An austere voice rang out.

Ling Han was on the defense in the first place, merely wanting her to stop and not intending to fight back. Thus, he naturally withdrew as well, leaving the decision in the hands of the young girl.

“No, I want to defeat him, I’m just a breath away!” the young girl declared with a pout and adorable naivete.

Two people walked outdoors. One was a man that looked to be only in his forties, dressed in a qilin robe, giving off an air of might without expressing any anger. The other was Xiang Chengyun. He was respectfully following behind this man, his hands stuck on either side of him as if he was a servant.

Needless to say, this middle-aged man was the Left Minister of the Empire, Li Cheng, also known as Minister Li, a super elite of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“You little girl, could it be that you still do not know that he is going easy on you after such a long fight?” Minister Li asked, smiling.

“What?” The young girl immediately stopped. Tilting her head to one side, she looked at Ling Han, and asked, “Hey, hey, hey, tell me the truth, were you purposely going easy on me?”

“Fourth Young Miss has extraordinary talent and ability.” Ling Han did not answer directly, but instead circled around and began to praise the young girl’s talent in martial arts. This was not mere flattery from him, though, as she was indeed very extraordinary.

The young girl was instantly all smiles, not realizing that Ling Han had changed the topic. She proudly raised her head, her snow white nape showing off her elegance as if it was the neck of a swan; one would feel pleased just from looking at her.

Her name was Li Weiwei, the fourth and youngest daughter of the Left Minister—the Left Minister had a total of four daughters. The Right Minister, on the other hand, had eight sons, and they really deserved to be called rivals.

Minister Li said, “Girl, did you know that this young man has just come from a small world?”

“Oh, isn’t it just shattering the empty void?” Li Weiwei said carelessly. With how big the Joint Peace Planet, there was a good several thousand people that ascended here from a small world every year, and on average, there were at least a dozen every day.

“You just shattered the empty void after reaching the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, you are really one with little courage!” She was a bit disdainful. Stepping into the Shattering Void Tier, one would be qualified to shatter the void to enter into the Immortal Realm. Even if you were the more careful type, then you should have acted the moment you reached the fifth or sixth layer, but you came to the Immortal Realm only after dragging it out into the ninth layer. Really, what a scaredy cat.

Minister Li revealed an astute smile, and asked, “Weiwei, why don’t we have a wager?”

“What kind of wager?” Li Weiwei asked without thinking too deeply.

“We’ll just wager on the outcome of the battle between you and Ling Han.” Minister Li smiled. “If you win, I will not attempt to control you any more in the future, and you can go wherever you like to play!”

“All right, you’re not allowed to weasel out!” Li Weiwei was immediately pleased. She had always wanted to leave the Imperial Capital and travel around, but Minister Li would keep worrying about this and that, and protected her very securely.

She was afraid that her father would take back his words, and immediately put up a fighting stance, ready to start fighting Ling Han at any moment.

Minister Li spread out his hands in front of him, and said, “If you lose—”

“How could I possibly lose?” Li Weiwei interrupted. In the current era, only a Shattering Void Tier cultivator like her would dare to interrupt the words of an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier.

Minister Li was naturally not going to become angry. Although he had four daughters, his first three daughters had married a few millennia ago already. This youngest daughter, meanwhile, had been born just over a dozen years ago, and was also the one that he doted on the most.

“If you lose, then you will have to be at least in the Mountain River Tier to be able to leave the Imperial Capital, and reach the Sun Moon Tier to be able to leave the territory of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire,” he said, smiling.

No matter how his daughter thought about it, there was no reason to lose!

“Fine!” Li Weiwei nodded. Presently, she only wanted to defeat Ling Han. Then, she would be able to leave the Imperial Capital and travel to various nations and lands, enjoying a life of freedom. Xiu , she rushed out and began her attacks on Ling Han.

Ling Han was still as how he had been, casually blocking and parrying. He had no intention of becoming a tool in the wager between this father and daughter, but it seemed to be unavoidable.

“Ling Han, I’m depending on you, you have to win!” Minister Li smiled as he said to Ling Han. Although he was all smiles, he had an air of supreme authority about him, which was both because he was an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier and because he was the Left Minister of a Majestic Empire.

Ling Han gave out a sigh. If he disobeyed, then the Left Minister would definitely make life difficult for him.

This kind of elite, this kind of noble... it would be really too easy for him to deal with Ling Han. It was absolutely impossible that anyone would be willing to stand up for him. Furthermore, even if the Left Minister killed him, they could always put another puppet in place.

He increased a bit of his battle prowess, and instantly gained the upper hand. However, he still left some face for Li Weiwei, and merely defeated her after over a hundred moves.

Li Weiwei could not accept this. How could this be possible—a Lower Realm cultivator was so fearful that he had to wait until he reached the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier to dare to enter into the Immortal Realm actually surpassed her in battle prowess? She shook her head blankly. After a while, she said, “I do not yield, we’ll battle again!”

Minister Li finally laughed loudly, and said, “Silly girl, Ling Han is the master of the small world. He had opened the sky successfully just a few days ago, bringing along the whole small world with him to ascend into the Immortal Realm.”

“Ah!” It was only now Li Weiwei realized that she had misunderstood previously. It turned out that Ling Han was not fearful of death, but rather dragged things out to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier because he wanted to split open the sky.

Those capable of opening the sky were definitely the prodigies of the era!

She had fallen into the trap; both Ling Han and her old man had fooled her together.

Despicable! Too despicable! She was angry now!
