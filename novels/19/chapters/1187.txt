Chapter 1188: Three Drops!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everyone was enraged. This brat had already obtained a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid, yet he still wanted to fight for a second drop?

Ever since this Yellow Spring Mystery Realm had opened, only one person had ever obtained two drops of Thousand Source True Fluid at once—Yang Hao.

Yang Hao had been a king tier among king tiers at that time, and he had suppressed all of the prodigies in his generation. Those of the old generation could only look up in awe as well. It was because of this that he was able to obtain two drops of Thousand Source True Fluid. However, could this brat compare to Yang Hao?

What a joke! Prodigies like Yang Hao would only appear once every one million years. When he reached the Mountain River Tier, people were certain that he would definitely reach the Heavenly Body Tier. What other prodigy could compare to him?

However, the cultivators genuinely had no clue how to deal with Ling Han’s freakish physique.

Although there were numerous people here, they all had their own agendas, and they were all here for their own benefits. How could they truly work together? However, if they were to battle one-on-one, who here—apart from the six king tiers—would be a match for Ling Han?

Thus, the cultivators quickly suppressed their anger. They sat down to rest and meditate that they could recover to their peak condition. This way, they could compete for the second drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.

One day quickly passed by.

Sun and moon crossed paths, and the second drop of Thousand Source True Fluid started to form. It gradually grew larger, and eventually rolled off the “eagle beak” under the force of gravity.

Xiu!

It fluttered with the wind as it drifted down the cliff’s face.

‘It’s mine!’

Not only did the older generation of elites start to move, but those who had reached the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier also dashed over to try their luck. After all, Thousand Source True Fluid was incredibly valuable. For those who were stuck at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, ingesting a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid would perhaps help them open the door to the Sun Moon Tier.

After reaching the Sun Moon Tier, their lifespan of 400,000 years would increase to 1,000,000 years. This was an astonishing increase. To say nothing of strength, just this increase in lifespan was worth risking their lives for.

The surroundings instantly descended into chaos.

Ling Han carefully picked a direction before explosively leaping forward.

Peng!

He soared into the sky, and those around him where all sent sprawling. He charged toward the second drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.

“You dare?!” He had already obtained a drop of divine fluid, and thus his choice to stay and fight for a second drop naturally made him the common enemy of the people. Countless attacks rushed toward him. Not only was he attacked by the elders who had severed their cultivation, but he was even attacked by some who were only at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

A cold glint flashed past Ling Han’s eyes. He had held back and avoided killing people before, and by the looks of it, these people had become convinced that he was a soft-hearted pushover. Even consummate level cultivators dared to attack him without fear and restraint.

One had to realize that in the cultivation world, he who possessed a higher cultivation level was senior!

“Humph!”

Ling Han brandished his Divine Demon Sword, causing divine patterns to materialize, and murderous aura to soar into the sky.

This was a weapon whose material had the potential to evolve into Divine Metal. Although it hadn’t reached that level yet, its quality was still incredible.

Shua, shua, shua!

Sword light flashed through the air, and severed limbs flew through the surroundings. Jets of blood sprayed into the sky.

“H-Han Lin, how ruthless of you! I’m a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect!” This person had lost a hand, and they were wild with fury as they shrieked at Ling Han.

Ling Han had already dashed past that person. However, when he heard their angry scream, he especially turned around to charge back over. “Humph! Did you hold back when you attacked me? Since you dared to provoke me, you should have been prepared to suffer my fury!”

His sword slashed down, and that person was instantly cut into two, both his body and his divine sense annihilated.

“You guys want to obstruct me? No problem! However, use your bum and ponder whether you have the strength to block me!” Ling Han said in a menacing voice. Coupled with the dozens of corpses around him, his words seemed especially threatening and domineering.

The other cultivators all frowned in anger. Use their bums to think? Was he comparing their brains to their bums? Was there really a need to degrade them like that?!

However, the ground was littered with fresh corpses, so who dared to protest?

Respect was earned through battling and killing. After killing dozens of cultivators to demonstrate his strength, the others finally didn’t dare to underestimate him any longer.

He was also a young king tier. Moreover... he was more terrifying than Shen Zhu’er and the five other king tiers combined because he possessed an invincible physique!

At least, it was invincible in this mystery realm.

Ling Han continued to barge toward the Thousand Source True Fluid. Meanwhile, just like before, it was the other five king tiers who occupied the core area of the battle. They were fighting over the Thousand Source True Fluid, though it wasn’t as if the others didn’t have a chance. If the Thousand Source True Fluid were struck and sent flying into the distance, perhaps some lucky person who was standing there would be able to easily obtain it and then flee.

“It’s you again!”

Shen Zhu’er and the others all grimaced upon seeing Ling Han.

“Heh, how are you all doing?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

‘How am I doing my a*s! It’s only been a day, and we’ve all been standing here around each other. Is there any need to ask how we’re doing?’

“Go!”

The five king tiers attacked Ling Han in unison. None of them was weaker than Ling Han. In fact, their power was even above that of Ling Han. However, anyone who unleashed power at the Sun Moon Tier would be targeted by the restrictions of this mystery realm. Thus, Shen Zhu’er and the others had to suppress their power such that it didn’t cross the boundary to the Sun Moon Tier.

Ling Han unleashed his Lightning Sword Technique, only attacking and not defending. He took full advantage of his freakish physique.

No one could outlast someone who had terrifying offensive abilities and invincible defensive abilities. After battling for a while, Ling Han charged through their attacks and obtained the second drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically.

This brat was taking things too far! He had already obtained two drops of Thousand Source True Fluid! Moreover, by the looks of it, he could still obtain the third, the fourth... He had the ability to obtain all 10 drops!

Even Yang Hao—the king tier of king tiers—had only managed to obtain two drops of Thousand Source True Fluid.

Ling Han was already on equal standing with Yang Hao at this moment. In fact, there was a significant chance that he would end up overtaking him.

Was... an even more terrifying prodigy going to appear?

Everyone’s expression darkened, and a few older-generation cultivators gathered together to discuss something.

Yang Hao had been able to obtain two drops of divine fluid, but hadn’t been able to obtain three. Why was this?

Being able to obtain two drops proved that his battle prowess was definitely impressive. So, why hadn’t he been able to obtain three drops?

This was because Yang Hao had become the target of everyone after obtaining his second drop of divine fluid.

Regardless of how freakishly prodigious he was, he still couldn’t endure becoming the enemy of everyone else!

Right now, the more elderly cultivators were starting to suggest that everyone work together to attack Ling Han. Ling Han’s physique was indeed invincible, but his power was not. Thus, they could trap him in some location and stop him from fighting for the divine fluid.

However, this pertained the division of benefits.

Those responsible for trapping Ling Han would clearly be forsaking their opportunity to fight for the divine fluid. As such, who was willing to take this role?

The third day rolled around, and another drop of divine fluid appeared.

The surroundings descended into chaos again, and this was especially beneficial to Ling Han. Attacks streaked through the air, and the cultivators had no choice but to dodge and weave. However, Ling Han could ignore them and walk straight through them. Thus, he was able to obtain the third drop of Thousand Source True Fluid with ease.

‘It’s his third drop!’

The others couldn’t tolerate this anymore, and they formed a special alliance to target Ling Han. When the fourth drop of divine fluid appeared, half of the older-generation cultivators turned their attention to Ling Han. In addition to them, three of the young king tiers also targeted Ling Han.

They trapped Ling Han where he was while the remaining cultivators fought over the fourth drop of Thousand Source True Fluid.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
