3061 The Li Clan’s Wedding

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t take such a small matter to heart. He also left the city, and followed behind Wang Quanhe.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t protect this descendant from the city, but he wanted to go to Qianshui Town to take a look.

He came to the old site of the Wang Clan. It had been three years since the tragedy. Naturally, the rivers of blood that had flowed there that day had long disappeared. The place had already turned back into a bustling area. However, it was not the Wang Clan that occupied this place today, but the Li Clan.

Ling Han released his divine sense in a scan, and a strange expression couldn’t help but appear on his face.

What a coincidence it was today. It was the day of Li Jingchu’s wedding. Her husband’s family had a powerful background, and he was a disciple of a large sect. His name was Luo Guang.

Was this Wang Quanhe’s luck attribute at play?

The Li Clan could have married their daughter a day earlier or a day later, but simply chose to hold the wedding today.

Ling Han did not make a move. He was merely tracing the origins of the Wang Clan, wanting to know exactly what his descendants had experienced.

At this moment, Wang Quanhe rushed over.

Wang Quanhe had needed three years to leave this place in the past. But now, he only used half a day to return.

There was no other reason. His cultivation level had soared, and he had advanced from the Heavenly Body Tier to Dividing Soul Tier. How many times had his strength increased?

To mention anything else, only Severing Mundane Tiers were capable of flying[1]. Just this point alone was enough to save him a lot of time.

He was filled with emotion, and was even more grateful to Ling Han.

Without Ling Han, there wouldn’t be the current him, so what revenge would there be to talk about? He would definitely be living in a corner somewhere, barely surviving and worrying about the Li Clan’s pursuit, right?

Three years had passed, and regardless of whether it was his abilities or appearance, he had changed greatly. Previously, he had still been a slightly inexperienced youth, but now he had become a slender young man, and his face had become more mature.

Walking on this familiar street, no one actually recognized him as a remnant of the Wang Clan. This gave Wang Quanhe the illusion that he had come to the wrong place.

He would go home and take a look first.

When he arrived at the old site of the Wang Clan, he saw a joyous scene.

Who was going to get married?

He grabbed a random person and interrogated him. His gaze immediately turned fierce. It was Li Jingchu!

A name that he had deliberately suppressed in his heart, but it would flip up from time to time to bite at his heart. This important accomplice who had caused the deaths and destruction of his clan was actually getting married now?

How could she!

Wang Quanhe’s expression immediately darkened. Fortunately, he had arrived in time. If it had been delayed until tomorrow, Li Jingchu would have had to leave with her husband after the wedding and head to a large sect to become a disciple of that large sect.

He looked up at the plaque on the door, and strode forward. Everything would end today.

“Sir, your invitation?” Someone stopped him.

Wang Quanhe grinned. “Why? You don’t even recognize me?”

That person stared at Wang Quanhe, and felt that this person looked somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t recall who it was for a moment.

“My surname is Wang!” Wang Quanhe added.

“Wang?” That person’s heart skipped a beat. In Qianshui Town, the surname Wang was a taboo. “Ah, you’re Wang Quanhe!”

He finally remembered, mainly because he had never thought that the only straggler from the Wang Clan who had slipped through the net would still dare to appear.

“What?!”

“Wang Quanhe!”

“The only descendant of the Wang Clan?”

Many people couldn’t help but be shocked when they heard this. That young man from the Wang Clan had actually returned?

However, it had only been three years. How could Wang Quanhe’s strength have changed?

Wouldn’t he just be courting death if he came back?

“It must be because of Li Jingchu.”

“That’s right. When the Wang Clan was destroyed, it was during Wang Quanhe and Li Jingchu’s wedding. Unexpectedly, after three years, Li Jingchu will get married again. When Wang Quanhe found out about it, he naturally couldn’t hold it in anymore.”

“Sigh, no one would be able to tolerate this. The woman who married him back then destroyed his entire clan. Now, she’s actually going to marry another man in the same place. How can this be tolerated?”

“Hush, lower your voice. Do you want to die?”

Everyone whispered to each other. There was definitely no lack of people from Qianshui Town attending the wedding banquet, so they naturally knew about this matter that happened only three years ago, not too far back in the past. Besides, the destruction of the Wang Clan was an incomparably sensational event for a small place like Qianshui Town. It would be mentioned even after 1,000 years passed.

Wang Quanhe strode into the main hall.

“Stop right there!” The Li Clan guards at the entrance tried to stop him, but Wang Quanhe only released his power lightly. Peng, peng, peng! These guards were sent flying. How could they stop him?

‘Huh?!’

Upon seeing this scene, the guests were all greatly shocked. Could it be that Wang Quanhe had encountered a great opportunity in the past three years? They remembered that he had only been in the Heavenly Body Tier back then, and definitely hadn’t had such battle prowess.

Wang Quanhe strode forward, and behind him were many injured people who had fallen to the ground. The scene was quite lively.

He was naturally very familiar with this place, and quickly arrived at the main hall. Coincidentally, the bride had just been invited out, and was about to bow with the groom. Next, she would be sent to the bridal chamber.

“Stop! Stop!” Of course, the Li Clan didn’t only have a few guards. More people chased after him, making a commotion.

This made the clan leader of the Li Clan involuntarily reveal a dissatisfied expression as he looked towards the elders at the side.

‘What kind of day is it today?’

It was the big day that Li Jingchu was going to be married to Luo Guang, the seventh grandson of the third elder of the Red Flame Sect!

What kind of force was the Red Flame Sect? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It was at the Celestial King Tier!

Jingchu was really a lucky star. Two years ago, she met Luo Guang by chance, and Luo Guang fell in love with her at first sight, starting a fierce courtship of her.

To the Luo Clan, they didn’t want Luo Guang to marry such a mediocre wife, but who asked Luo Guang to like her? After coaxing and pestering them for two years, the Luo Clan finally nodded and approved.

However, the wedding would only be held in Qianshui Town. After returning to the Red Flame Sect, the Luo Clan would not hold another wedding, because they could not afford to lose face.

…Marrying such an ordinary woman, and you still wanted a big wedding? What a joke.

However, to the Li Clan, being able to climb up and get a connection to the Luo Clan was already a blessing. This was because the Luo Clan had an Ascending-Origin-Tier ancestor, and the sect master of the Red Flame Sect was a Celestial King.

An elder of the Li Clan immediately stood up, and shouted outside, “What is all the noise about!”

“F-Fourth Elder, the surviving member of the Wang Clan is here!” a guard said breathlessly.

‘What?!’

The big shots of the Li Clanwere all stunned, and Li Jingchu, who was wearing a red veil, also trembled slightly. The groom beside her immediately sensed it.

“Jingchu, I’ll take care of everything,” Luo Guang said, his eyes full of confidence and disdain.

This was only a mere Severing-Mundane-Tier clan, so it was only natural for them to make a fuss over some small matter.

Even though he was only a Severing Mundane Tier, he had countless rare treasures on him. He alone could annihilate a force like the Li Clan.

“Yes.” Li Jingchu nodded, and said, “Thank you, Luo Guang.”

“I’m your husband. Your business is my business,” Luo Guang said very gently.

Li Jingchu leaned over slowly. “I know. You’re good to me.”

“Li Clan, I’m here!” Wang Quanhe had already walked into the main hall, and his gaze was fixed on the newly married couple in the red wedding attire.

[1] I’m pretty sure lower cultivation back in the first world, before mc split the sky, was enough to fly, but remember it’s a higher world with stronger laws and whatnot, so different restrictions (probably) apply.
