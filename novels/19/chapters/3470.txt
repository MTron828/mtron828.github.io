Chapter 3471: Chess piece

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor. Henyee Translations

“Yi, what’s going on?”

“He clearly only has to make one more chess move, and he would be killed!

“Even I can close my eyes and play this move, so why is there no reaction from

the Formation Spirit?”

“What is the meaning of this?”

“Is this public cheating?”

30 seconds, 50 seconds, one minute, and it was automatically a loss.

“F***, what the hell?”

“Why aren’t the pieces moving?”

“It’s clear that just one move would be able to kill him!”

“This is so unfair!”

Everyone shouted loudly, filled with confusion and displeasure.

The general on the other side, the light figure, suddenly walked towards Ling Han. When it arrived in front of Ling Han, it stopped, nodded and said, “Though there are innumerable people who have passed here, but thinking of using formations to break out of the situation, you are the ninth.”

“This is your reward for your courage and uniqueness.

The shadowy figure handed him something.

Ling Han accepted it and looked at it. This was actually a chess piece, but it was very small. It was about the size of a normal chess piece, and there was the word “Elephant” written on it.

Er, as a memento?

-When you encounter danger, there is no harm in throwing out a chess piece. There will be pleasant surprises,” the shadowy figure said. Then, with a flash, he disappeared.

Only now did everyone know that it was not Ling Han that had cheated, or that the formation had taken special care of him, but rather that Ling Han had made use of the time limit of the game between moves, and used the formation to forcefully break out of the situation.

Something like that was possible?

An elite of formations!

They all looked at Ling Han. This seemed to be even more awesome. You see, Li Shuangyi would occasionally make mistakes, but Ling Han only had to throw out a few formation foundations, and he would be able to solve the problem.

In comparison, it was obviously Ling Han that was more reliable.

“Brother, how about helping me pass the test? I can give you jade seeds.

“If you want an ancient treasured tome, that’s fine too.”

Quite a number of people immediately called out.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He had no shortage of jade seeds, and what kind of treasured book could these people take out that could compare to Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique? Could it compare to the divine art on the stone wall?

“Sorry, I’m in a rush.” He strode off.

“Wait!” When he passed by Li Shuangyi, the latter suddenly stretched out a

hand and stopped Ling Han.

“What can I do for you?” Ling Han asked.

“You actually dare to publicly embarrass me, you are really brave!” Li Shuangyi declared coldly, a coldness flickering in his eyes, “A mere Extreme Bone Tier, I can crush you with a single finger!”

Ling Han sighed. He was an Extreme Bone Tier, and it seemed like this had also become the point of attracting animosity. Was it really necessary? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

What business is it of yours if I cultivate slowly?

“You speak so much nonsense. You want a fight?” Ling Han looked at him disdainfully.

“Hehe, to kill a piece of trash like you, is there any need for me to do it myself?” Li Shuangyi asked calmly, then looked towards the people behind him, “You all owe me a favour. Now, whoever can kill this brat would be considered to have repaid this favour.”

Instantly, everyone was excited.

Killing a minor character in the Extreme Bone Tier was naturally effortless, but they could repay a favor, so everyone were naturally scrambling over one another for the first shot.

All of a sudden, five people actually charged out at the same time. Immediately, Ling Han received a notification in his mind. Should he lower the other’s cultivation level? Should he isolate them?

“Reduce to Inscription Tier, and let them attack together.” Ling Han stepped forwards. He had just charged up to Fourth Extreme and hadn’t tested out how much his abilities had improved, so these five people would be his sparring partners.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han channeled his power with all his might. However, he didn’t use the Demonic Monkey Fists or the murderous aura to attack them. Even so, he was still completely on the upper hand, completely suppressing the five people.

He had advanced another minor level, and his battle prowess still hadn t reached the Enlightenment Tier. However, he was more and more invincible among Inscription Tiers.

“F***, what kind of monster is this!” Everyone was watching dumbfounded. When the battle began, everyone could see clearly that the five people were all suppressed to the level of Inscription Tier, but five Inscription Tier elites against one Extreme Bone Tier, they were actually suppressed. Just how inconceivable was this?

Their scalps all went numb. How could there be such a freakish guy?

Even Li Shuangyi felt a chill run down his back. Though he was very talented, he was invincible among his peers, at most. He could not even battle with a disadvantage of a major tier, what more to be invincible like Ling Han with a disadvantage of a major tier.

And it just so happened that if they battled here, the cultivation level of elites would be decreased. Then, the higher one’s talent in martial arts, the more one would be able to stand out from the rest.

Thankfully, if the weak actively provoked, the strong would not have their cultivation level suppressed.

When he thought of this, Li Shuangyi breathed a sigh of relief. At least, he did not have to worry that his life would be in danger.

Peng, peng, peng! The five Inscription Tier elites were unable to stop Ling Han, and they were quickly defeated by him.

These people were only lackeys, and Ling Han didn’t kill them. Instead, he glared at Li Shuangyi, his killing intent cold.

Li Shuangyi, however, began to applaud, and said, “If I say you’re the strongest Extreme Bone Tier elite, there is no doubt about it. However, your cultivation level is really too low. When you leave the Mystery Realm, I’ll kill you at the first instant!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I don’t know you at all, and I didn’t offend you either. However, you’ve suffered a blow because of your superiority complex, so you want to kill me? Heh, you’re truly… despicable! Sorry, I can’t find any suitable words to describe you at this moment. I can only say that you’re despicable.”

Despicable?

Li Shuangyi was instantly enraged. He clenched his fists tightly, yet said, “Are you trying to provoke me into making a move? Don’t waste your effort; I won’t fall for it!”

Ling Han retrieved the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t waste any time.

One, two, three, four, five!

He suddenly activated Absolute Fairness, and then threw the Heavenly Pattern Jade. With Spiritual Power, it instantly reached nine times the speed of sound.

This was a super deadly weapon.

Pu!

Li Shuangyi didn’t even have the chance to react before the Heavenly Pattern Jade smashed into his chest. Under the massive impact and tearing, his whole person exploded, turning into a shower of blood and shattered bones.

“I told you you were despicable, yet you didn’t believe me,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. He walked over and picked up the Heavenly Pattern Jade. This was truly a treasure, without a single trace of blood on it.

“I’ve never seen someone so suicidal.”

He turned around, and saw that everyone was still in a state of numbness. All of them were gaping widely, disbelief written all over their faces.

An elite of Enlightenment Tier was actually directly smashed to death with a rock?

This was natural. Compared to Tong Miao and Dong Qi, Li Shuangyi’s strength was much weaker. Even Tong Miao and Dong Qi were heavily injured, so wouldn’t this guy be smashed to death with a single strike?

Ling Han smiled, and strode off.

He had already drawn the babies into his gourd in advance., so there was naturally nothing to detain him.

Those that had similarly passed did not dare to walk alongside him at all. This was too terrifying. He was practically like a god of death, a demon king.

“Who exactly is this person?”

“I know him. His name is Ling Han, and he’s the Ling Han from the Twin Prodigies of the Imperial City.”

“What, this is only a native?”

“This time, no one dares to underestimate him anymore.

“Indeed, in a battle of equal cultivation levels, who would be a match for him? “Sigh, with such competitors, it is absolutely impossible to become the Young Dragon.”

“Forget it, let’s go out..”
