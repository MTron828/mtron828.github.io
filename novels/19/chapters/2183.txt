Chapter 2184: Sealing the path

The reason that Ye Jiande so daringly provoked Ling Han like this was because there was another tall, sturdy man standing at his side. He looked to be only about 30, but five-colored light was actually entwining around him.

This was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King!

…The Celestial King of the Ye Clan, Ye Wuhai.

With a Fifth Heaven Celestial King by his side, Ye Jiande naturally dared to glare angrily at Ling Han. Furthermore, if this was not still the territory of the Heavenly Saint Palace, he would even beg Ye Wuhai to kill Ling Han for him.

Killing intent flashed through Ling Han’s eyes. He had initially planned to leave this kind of trash for his son to deal with, but this trash was actually so arrogant. He was really courting his own death.

“On the Dragon’s Gate Mountain, everyone will be equivalent to a carp that is waiting to leap over the Dragon’s Gate. Heavenly Dao is extremely just. Everyone’s cultivation level will be suppressed to Mountain River Tier, and there will be no Celestial King Tier, or Ascending Origin Tier, or Immortal Palace Tier,” Ling Han recited the information about Dragon’s Gate Mountain that he had memorized.

“So what if he is a Celestial King? If he dares to interfere at that time, I will try my luck at killing a Celestial King.

“In a battle of equal levels, aside from Ji Wuming, who else would be able to match me?”

Ling Han was brimming with confidence. He was definitely not overestimating himself.

Ji Wuming had once been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and the reason he had reincarnated and began cultivating from the beginning had to be because he wanted to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Thus, he had surely been stronger than he had been at this cultivation level in his past life.

Just how awesome was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Thus, the present Ji Wuming had to be superior to all Celestial Kings if they were at the same cultivation level. Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was no exception. Yet Ling Han could manage to battle Ji Wuming to a stalemate. This meant that he could also dominate all Celestial Kings that were at the same cultivation level as himself.

Because there were really too many people that wanted to use this Transfer Formation, everyone could only line up. Though Ling Han was the Heavenly Will Elder, he did not have many special privileges, either. After all, his cultivation level was too low, and not even Ascending Origin Tiers needed to be wary of him, what more a Celestial King.

After lining up for over a day, they finally boarded the Transfer Formation.?Weng, light surged, and they felt a strong physical pull on their bodies. When they regained their wits, they had already arrived at the small town that was on the westernmost boundary of the Roc Heaven.

Walking from here towards the west for less than 5,000 km, one would have exited the Roc Heaven. Then, one would have to pass over the Nine Dragons Heaven, Deep Sea Heaven, and five other Heavenly Realms to be able to enter the Yin River Heaven. This time, the Dragon’s Gate Mountain had appeared there.

They began hurrying on their journey. Ling Han used Void Space, and crossed millions and millions of kilometers, his speed being higher than even most Immortal Palace Tiers’.

Even so, they had still required half a year’s time before finally entering the Yin River Heaven.

The Yin River Heaven lived up to its name. Wherever they were, they would be able to see a long river flowing across the skies. It was dark and dense like iron, but this long river was so high it could not be reached. Even Immortal Palace Tiers could not touch it before they would be struck back down by the storm above the Nine Heavens.

However, Ascending Origin Tiers could give it a try, but it was said that the waters of the Yin River were incredibly and extraordinarily freezing. Even Ascending Origin Tiers could not stand against this extreme coldness, and would be frozen to death.

However, for cultivators who cultivated the Regulation of Water, this was a sacred place as they could better study the Great Dao of Water here.

“Let’s check where exactly the Dragon’s Gate Mountain is.” They found a map, and began searching.

“Here.”

Once they had confirmed the direction, they continued on their journey, advancing towards the Dragon’s Gate Mountain.

Because they were not familiar with the area, they spent some additional time. After over a dozen days, they finally arrived at the foot of the Dragon’s Gate Mountain.

This had initially been a great ocean, but now an indescribably massive great mountain had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, filling up the entire ocean.

It was abundantly clear how colossal the mountain was. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, if one looked up from the foot of the mountain, he would not be able to see the summit at all, and could only see divine clouds and celestial mist wafting around, taking the form of dragons, phoenixes, and other beasts. It also seemed like there was a Celestial seated there, reciting the great dao, which manifested into the light of Regulations.

The Dragon’s Gate Mountain was indeed extraordinary.

Ding, ding, ding, ding. Dang, dang, dang, dang.

Battles were happening everywhere at the foot of the mountain. There was strife everywhere as long as there were people, and there was nothing false about this.

After entering into the area of the Dragon’s Gate Mountain, Ling Han and his group immediately discovered that not only had they lost the ability of flight, even the height that they could leap was greatly restricted. It was as if they had become mere mortals all of a sudden.

True, the Dragon’s Gate Mountain would have been too easy to climb otherwise.

“We can’t draw others into the Spatial God Tool. Without the records of our entire journey up the mountain, the heaven and earth would absolutely not give us any recognition. Even if we did manage to leap over the Dragon’s Gate, it would be for nothing.” Ling Han released the women from inside the Black Tower.

Next, everyone could only depend on themselves. Even if they were carried up the mountain, that, too, would not be recognized by the heaven and earth.

“It’s fine. Walking for a while is a healthy exercise,” Li Sichan joked.

“However, flight is not possible, nor can one leap too high or too far. In that case, we would not be able to use this path.” Ling Han cast his gaze afar. It was all steep, sheer cliffs in this mountainous area, and it could not be so easily crossed.

“We have to find a major path.”

They retreated from the mountainous area, and immediately regained the ability of flight. They circled around the mountain, and soon found a main path that was relatively easier to travel.

According to the information, there were many such main paths, and there was no need for them all to be cramped on this one to ascend the mountain.

Ling Han and his group all descended, and were about to advance when they heard that this area had actually been sealed off by someone.

“Scram!” Immediately, someone shouted at Ling Han and the others. “This place has already been occupied by our Battle Dragon Palace. Any intruders will be killed!”

‘Does this place belong to you?’

Ling Han was surprised. There was no rare treasure in this Dragon’s Gate Mountain, nor were there any Celestial medicines or cultivation techniques, and everyone could leap over the Dragon’s Gate. Was there any need to seal off the mountain?

But when he thought about it further, realization dawned on him.

When they were on the mountain, everyone would be restrained by the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Should they encounter enemies, the advantage elites had in their superior cultivation level could not be exercised at all. It was completely dependent on their strength in a battle of equal levels, which also meant that even if it was a Celestial King, if he met with a more freakishly talented Severing Mundane Tier, or Dividing Soul Tier, it was still possible that they could be defeated and killed.

Hence, to ensure their safety, sealing off the path was naturally the best strategy.

If no one could ascend, there naturally would not be any outbreaks of battle, and there was naturally no need to worry.

“Battle Dragon Palace? Not a bad name, but why is everyone as scared as mice, and completely not daring to battle?” Ling Han shook his head, appearing extremely disdainful.

“Brat, spare the nonsense and scram!” There were over a dozen people from the Battle Dragon Palace that were responsible for sealing off the path up the mountain, but their strength was all very low.

True, how could those with some strength be willing to seal off the path here? They definitely would have ascended the mountain, wanting to leap over the Dragon’s Gate, and turn their ordinary aptitude into extraordinary quality.

However, the name of the Battle Dragon Palace was still quite intimidating. It was an Ascending Origin Tier force, so it was no wonder that these people dared to act so arrogantly.

“You guys are the ones who should scram!” Hu Niu shot out a fist.?Peng, as her punch swept past, all the members of the Battle Dragon Palace were sent flying, scattering like flower petals in the air.

Meanwhile, Ling Han shook his head. “The heaven and earth has deliberately allowed the Dragon’s Gate Mountain to arrive in advance for the specific purpose of allowing more elites to appear so that a resistance can be put up against the force of darkness, but these people actually wanted to seal off the mountain. To go against the will of heaven and earth, how could they possibly gain the approval of the heaven and earth?

“You deserved it!”

They ascended the mountain, and immediately discovered that they had lost all ability of flight, and their progress had also become slower and slower. The test from heaven and earth had already begun.

The great mountain rose majestically, and could not be seen entirely as far as the eye could see.

Everyone was focused on hastening on with their journey. It was said that one could not enter into a Spatial God Tool for the entirety of the climb up the mountain, or all previous efforts would be completely wasted. Thus, they had to manage their stamina. This place seemed divine, yet was extremely short of Spiritual Qi, and one could only rely on alchemical pills to replenish the Origin Power that had been expended.
