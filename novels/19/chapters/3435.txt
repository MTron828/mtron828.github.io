Chapter 3436: Celestial Path elite appears

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Cui Xiaoxiao charged over, bringing with her a frightening might. She was going to crush Ling Han into dust in a single stroke.

In truth, she was indeed stronger than Cui Changyun. Her speed was faster her power was greater, and the high-level energy that she could communicate with was denser. Though they were only slightly stronger, but added together, her battle prowess had increased not just by a little bit.

Ling Han was unafraid, and still shot out a murderous aura attack.

Even if Cui Xiaoxiao was already prepared, her eyes were still dazed from the shock, and she lost her sense of direction. She only recovered after at least half a second had passed.

In a battle between elites, could they afford to miss this half a second?

Peng! She was once again sent flying by Ling Han.

Thankfully, without the Heavenly Pattern Jade, Ling Han was not able to able to kill such a powerful Inscription Tier elite with a single strike either. He would only be able to wound her.

After a consecutive few times, Cui Xiaoxiao finally calmed down.

She looked at Ling Han, and frowned slightly.

“When you were in Blood Transformation Tier, you attained the Sixth Change!” she said through gritted teeth.

It was not difficult to reach Twenty Meridians, but it was difficult to reach Sixth Change. At least, neither she nor Cui Changyun had been able to do so.

Ling Han nodded. He had indeed cultivated the Sixth Change. There was nothing to hide. However, he wouldn’t take the initiative to say that he had actually reached the Seventh Change.

To say nothing of an unprecedented event, at least in the entire Celestial Sea Planet, he was the only one who had reached the Seventh Change.

“Sixth Change, Blood Qi Condensation Emperor, no wonder it has such a powerful intimidation ability!” Cui Xiaoxiao said fiercely. Having additionally cultivated another level, this surpassed ordinary cultivators, and possessed an ability that was close to a Mystical Power, which would strengthen as the cultivation level increased. For other cultivators, this kind of ability was really hard to deal with.

It was clear that her cultivation level was higher, yet she was very severely affected, so she was unable to fully unleash her strength.

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “No need to feel rueful. If you want a battle, I’ll oblige.”

Killing intent surged from his body. Since he had already killed once, he would not mind killing another child of Cui Zhenhai.

Yet Cui Xiaoxiao raised her hand, and a firework shot skywards, exuding a blazing light. Even if there was a window between them, one would probably still be dazed by the blinding light.

She was summoning a helper, and the greatest possibility was her old man, Cui Zhenhai.

Ling Han’s expression finally became serious. If a Celestial Path elite came, how would he face them?

Flee?

With the divine sense of Celestial Path elites, where could he flee to?

From the moment Ling Han stepped out to accept the challenge, to the moment he killed Cui Changyun, he was already prepared to face Cui Zhenhai directly.

He was betting on Chen Fengyan’s domineering attitude. He definitely wouldn’t allow anyone to cause trouble in the Imperial Capital.

“Ling Han, run!” someone shouted at Ling Han.

“That’s right. Once Cui Zhenhai arrives, you will not be able to leave.”

You’ve killed his son, so he definitely won’t let you go!”

Many kind-hearted people told Ling Han to take advantage of this time to flee as quickly as possible.

Meanwhile, Cui Xiaoxiao smirked coldly, “After killing a member of our Cui Clan, you still want to pat your behind and pretend that nothing had happened?”

Ling Han ignored hrt completely, and only looked at Gu Xiangming, “Aren’t you tired after holding it for so long?”

Gu Xiangming sighed. He would never be able to take revenge on Ling Han in this lifetime. The gap between the two of them was already as wide as heaven and earth. Furthermore, not only would this gap not shrink, it would only become larger and larger.

He obediently handed over the Heavenly Pattern Jade, not daring to play any tricks.

Ling Han accepted the Heavenly Pattern Jade, put it away, and waited quietly for Cui Zhenhai to arrive. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In just a short while, a figure was seen striding over from the sky. His speed was astonishingly fast, and had definitely surpassed ten times the speed of sound, leaving behind a very long trail behind him.

Everyone was transfixed with shock.

Stepping over from the skies, was this a Celestial?

Xiu, this person landed on the ground. He looked to be in his thirties, with a lanky figure and a square face, appearing very majestic.

Cui Zhenhai?

Ling Han thought to himself. On that day, the Demonic Rathad also come by treading on air, but when it saw Chen Fengyan stepping on air step by step, it was extremely shocked. Obviously, the difficulty level of standing in midair in a slow state was far higher than flying at high speed.

If Cui Zhenhai possessed enough strength, then he would definitely stand aloft in midair, which could further increase his divine might.

Celestials were high and noble, looking down disdainfully on ordinary beings on the ground.

Thus, it was not that Cui Zhenhai was keeping a low profile, but rather that his abilities were inadequate.

Father!” Cui Xiaoxiao approached, “My younger brother has been killed.”

Cui Zhenhai’s eyes sharpened, and he asked, “Who did it?”

Cui Xiaoxiao pointed at Ling Han, “That’s him.”

Cui Zhenhai looked towards Ling Han, yet revealed a hint of surprise, “A mere

First Extreme can actually kill Changyun?”

He could not believe it. The gap in cultivation level was really too wide, and his son should have been able to sweep aside all opposition in Inscription Tier. How could he have been counter-killed by a First Extreme?

Pu!

Hearing Cui Zhenhai’s words, quite a number spluttered.

Previously, Cui Changyun had been easily thrashed by Ling Han, and then revealed the “fact” that Ling Han was in Inscription Tier. In truth, a great many people believed it, because in their eyes, battling against someone who had surpassed the cultivation level of a major tier was inconceivable in the first place, what more when he had to defeat someone with a higher cultivation level.

But now, Cui Zhenhai had personally said that Ling Han was only a First Extreme.

How could a Celestial Path elite spout nonsense?

Hiss, Ling Han was really too freakish, wasn’t he? He was weaker by more than

a major tier, yet could still kill his opponent with a single move.

Though not many people had seen Hong Tianbu make a move, everyone was sure that even that overwhelming freak, Hong Tianbu, could not do it to this extent.

Cui Zhenhai humphed, and all the noise in the area instantly disappeared. The pressure exuded by Celestial Path elites was too terrifying.

He looked at Ling Han, and frowned slightly.

He was the one who had instigated his son to challenge Ling Han. In his eyes, the so-called heaven-defying freak, the twin prodigies of the Majestic Empire were all simply the boasts of ignorant fools. Meanwhile, he had great ambitions, and wanted to take over the Chen Clan’s territory in one go Thus he wanted his son to defeat Ling Han and Hong Tianbu, striking a blow to the morale of the people of the Imperial Capital.

At that time, he would defeat Chen Fengyan, and it would only be a matter of course for him to take over the throne.

Unexpectedly, the weakest Ling Han had not even been gotten rid of, when his son was killed first.

His son had been killed, so he was naturally furious. Add to that the fact that he had failed to establish his might and had instead been slapped in the face, he was naturally filled with anger.

Since that was the case, there was no need for so many twists and turns. He would move personally, and sweep aside all opposition.

In any case, the most important thing in this world was strength.

“Brat, you dare to kill my son?” Cui Zhenhai asked coldly, “Who gave you such damn courage?”

Ling Han’s eyes were level, and he said, “In a spar, casualties and injuries are inevitable. If you’re afraid of even this, what right do you have to be a cultivator?”

“Howaudacious!” Cui Zhenhai humphed, “Kneel down!”

Weng, a powerful aura pressed down on Ling Han.

This was the attack of a Celestial Path elite. Even if he didn’t use his true strength, and merely used his Spiritual Power, it was still enough to send the three souls and seven spirits of a Mystery Realm Tier elite flying out of his body?.

He could kill with a single thought, and this was a Celestial Path elite.

Ling Han gathered all of his Spiritual Power, and then used the murderous aura as a blade, turning it into a fist that punched towards this surge of Spiritual Power.
