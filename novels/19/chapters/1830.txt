Chapter 1831: Retrieving the Heavenly Dao Jade

After waiting for another day, the mountain cave finally opened. The rocks miraculously melted, revealing the passage of entry.

The Heavenly Dao Jade was formed from the Source Power of Earth, so it was very ordinary that it possessed this kind of ability. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

On this day, Ling Han did a few things, such as plundering the Spatial God Tools that Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun had left behind. There was a considerable amount of good stuff inside. A descendant of a Celestial King Tier force was indeed rich and imposing.

Both the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou stayed outside. They were not members of the race of dwarves, nor did they have any Celestial King Tier techniques, so they could not possibly oppose the power of Regulation of the Heavenly Dao Jade. They could die very easily.

Ling Han was protected by the Nine Heavens Flame. There was an abundance of Fire Element here, and added with the fact that he had cultivated the Flame Control Technique, he could unleash the full might of the Nine Heavens Flame.

It was not dark inside the mountain cave. Multiple stalactites were exuding a gentle light. The whole cave was not large. He had only walked half a mile, and there was already no further path ahead of him.

A large rock that was flatter than the others stood out in front of him, and there were two infants that lay on it. They looked like they were just a few months’ old. They neither cried nor fussed, and when they realized Ling Han had entered, they both cast curious gazes at him as they surveyed him.

Ling Han knew that these were dwarves that had been birthed from the Heavenly Dao Jade. He couldn’t help but feel rueful. Ultimately, the race of dwarves had not gone extinct.

He picked up the two infants, and released all the corpses from the dwarves’ village from the Black Tower with a wave of his hand.

This would be the resting grounds of all the dwarves.

After doing all this, he looked ahead. There was a stone pedestal which held a precious pearl. It was exuding a gentle light. Upon a closer look, that precious pearl was actually carved from jade, but the slightest signs of being carved could not be seen.

It should be naturally shaped and formed by the powers of heaven and earth.

“Heavenly Dao Jade!” Small Tower spoke up, and there was actually a tremble in its voice. “In this world, there is a pitifully small amount of Heavenly Dao Jade, and usually an epoch would be needed to truly nurture a single piece.”

In truth, from Heavenly Dao Source Rock to Heavenly Dao Jade, this process only needed a few hundred million years, but the formation of the Heavenly Dao Source Rock itself would need a very long time, and since that time was counted into the formation of the Heavenly Dao Jade, that naturally meant an incredibly prolonged period of time.

Ling Han couldn’t help but say, “At first, Celestial Kings were also considered few and far between, but afterwards you said that there was an overwhelmingly large number of them. Could it be that in some Celestial King Tier sect, there would be as many as a pile of Heavenly Dao Jade too?”

Small Tower hesitated slightly, and then said, “That is not impossible.”

Celestial Kings had absolutely no limit to their lifespan. To say nothing of an epoch, they would be able to live for 100 or even 1,000 epochs. Then, in their extended lives, it was actually not very hard to understand that they had obtained more than one Heavenly Dao Jade.

“This is the confidence of a great sect,” Small Tower said. “For example... the Roc Palace!”

“You seem to know a lot about the Roc Palace,” Ling Han said in a questioning tone.

Small Tower paused slightly, and then said, “If we come down to it, we have some relations with the Roc Palace as well.”

“What!?” Ling Han was astonished, and thoughts streaked through his mind. Involuntarily, a shocked expression appeared on his face. “Then, the previous Imperial Empress having died in the Lower Realm is actually no coincidence.”

“Hehe, how could there be anything so coincidental in this world?” Small Tower did not avoid the issue this time round, and it seemed like it wanted to let Ling Han know some secrets.

“What kind of force is the Roc Palace?” Ling Han was curious now.

“Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier!” Small Tower replied seriously.

Ling Han felt hot blood rush through his veins, but then immediately frowned. “But the previous Imperial Empress of Roc Palace has already died!”

“There is another,” Small Tower said smilingly. “And that is the person that was called old witch.”

Ling Han almost spluttered. That old woman using a walking cane?

F***, that was actually a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

No wonder she was so awesome.

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han hurriedly said, “Why didn’t that old witch discover your presence? Moreover, why didn’t you acknowledge each other?”

If that hadn’t been the case, he would not have to be separated from his parents, lovers, and son for so long.

Small Tower slowly said, “Firstly, as long as you don’t use the Black Tower right in front of a Celestial King, then even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King couldn’t possibly discover it. Secondly, before everything is clear, there is no one that could be fully trusted.

“Thirdly, if you had gone to the Celestial Realm early on, it would’ve been detrimental to your development. The path of a Heavenly Venerable Tier has always begun from a small world and all the way onwards.”

“Just who exactly is the Heavenly Venerate that you speak of?” Ling Han immediately pointed out.

Since Small Tower said that their branch had some relation to the Roc Palace, this Heavenly Venerate’s abilities had to be strong enough. Otherwise, how could he have had relations with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

There were Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and every single step forwards was as difficult as ascending the heavens. How could that be a mere joke?

Small Tower became silent again. After a while, it finally said, “Stop blabbering nonsense, and retrieve the Heavenly Dao Jade quickly! If you want to know more, first, you have to advance into the fifth severance, and second, quickly advance your cultivation level.

“With your present strength, you would only be seeking your own death if you knew too many secrets!”

‘F***, you tsundere Tower!’

Ling Han looked ahead. This place was covered with the Regulations of the Great Dao, and aside from the race of dwarves that was of the same origins as the Heavenly Dao Jade, other beings would be immediately crushed by the Regulations of the Great Dao once they entered into this place.

However, if Ling Han ignited the Nine Heavens Flame, that would be enough to oppose it.

This similarly was a Source Power of heaven and earth!

Strictly speaking, the Heavenly Dao Jade was no longer a Source Power of heaven and earth. It had already evolved from being a Source Power of heaven and earth, and become a different object.

Small Tower has said before that every elemental Source Power of heaven and earth could only be maintained at the apex number of nine, such as the Nine Great Ancestral Flames. Before an ancestral flame had vanished, it was impossible for an ancestral flame to be born.

But Heavenly Dao Jade was different. There could be many of them because it was not a Source Power of heaven and earth.

Refining the Heavenly Dao Jade could not form the Source Power of Earth inside one’s body, and could only compensate for the regrets that one had experienced in the path of cultivation before, and open a path towards becoming a supreme monarch tier for a flawless emperor tier.

Though this path would be a very, very narrow escape.

Ling Han strode forwards. When he had gotten to a specific distance, the Heavenly Dao Jade shone, and the light was so intense that it seemed like a sun. The ripple of Regulations became even stronger, wanting to forcibly erase Ling Han.

Unfortunately, this kind of power of Regulation was removed from cultivation level, so Ling Han was completely able to use Nine Heavens Flame to resist it. Essentially, they were both Source Powers of heaven and earth, so neither was inferior to the other.

Furthermore, if one Nine Heavens Flame was not enough, he still had the Xuanyin Source Water.

Ling Han did not draw upon the Xuanyin Source Water, because Nine Heavens Flame was enough to match it. However, his speed slowed down considerably. Still, he had finally still managed to reach the stone pedestal. He stretched out a hand to grab the Heavenly Dao Jade, which he then later stored into the Black Tower.

Smoothly and without a hitch.

Amazing!

Weng, the whole mountain cave fluctuated, and a change that was indiscernible to the naked eye took place.

Ling Han knew that from now onwards, it was impossible for the tribe of dwarves to be birthed from this place in future. The two infant dwarves that he was presently holding would be the last descendants of this tribe.

He had to think of some way for them to blend in with the normal humans, marry, and give birth to the next generation.

Ling Han was confident that he could change the fates of these two.

“Small Tower, is this Heavenly Dao Jade considered big or small?” Ling Han asked, slightly anticipatory. He did not want to benefit alone from a treasure. It was best if the Empress could share the benefits with him. If possible, he also planned to bring a little for Hu Niu.

However, the Roc Palace was a supreme sect that even possessed Natural Peach Seal, so perhaps they did not just have a single Heavenly Dao Jade, either.

Small Tower humphed, and said, “This Heavenly Dao Jade is not to be used by two people.”

Ah. Ling Han was instantly extremely disappointed.

“It is enough for three to use!” Small Tower added.
