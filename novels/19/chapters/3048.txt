3049 Entering Hysteria’s World

Ling Han was dishing out a beatdown.

Even though he managed to prove that Xin Qihu had been pretending this whole time, the latter only had himself to blame for harboring thoughts of killing Ling Han to begin with. What was more important was that the guy had a face that just deserved to be beaten up.

After venting his frustration, Ling Han finally stopped, smiling with satisfaction.

So what if he was a Sixth Tier? Xin Qihu was still beaten to a bloody pulp. His face was absolutely horrendous.

“Ling Han!” Xin Qihu yelled.

Ling Han glared. “Say my name one more time, and I will beat you up for another hour. Do you believe me?”

Xin Qihu had no choice but to fall silent. After all, Ling Han possessed great power now, and could easily torment him.

Although his life wasn’t being threatened anymore, he still wanted to hold on to his pride.

“Alright, that’s enough. Come, let us have a drink.” Bai Mifan quickly conciliated both parties.

The five prodigies had gathered together for drinks and chatted with glee. Naturally, Xin Qihu was unable to enjoy himself as much, constantly touching his cheeks and grimacing in pain.

“Ling Han, you’ve finally broken through to the Sixth Tier. What tremendous battle prowess,” Lin Youlian mused. Back then, she had still been able to help Ling Han resolve a big problem, but not even 10 of her would be a match for Ling Han now.

Moreover, she possessed the battle prowess of the middle stage of the Seventh Tier. However, this was her limit as a Sixth Tier. Unless she was able to break through to the Seventh Tier, her battle prowess would not increase any further.

The higher the cultivation level, the more difficult it was to battle against someone beyond one’s level. This was especially true for those in the Sixth and Seventh Tier.

“How strong are you now exactly?” Wu Haoyang asked.

Back then, he had had a sense of rivalry with Ling Han, but he knew that Ling Han had far surpassed him now.

Ling Han said modestly, “Just a little stronger than your normal Seventh Tier.”

Xin Qihu gritted his teeth in vexation. How could Ling Han be just a little stronger? Xin Qihu was a victim of Ling Han’s violence, and had personally experienced the latter’s strength; Ling Han was practically a monster.

“Brother Ling, what do you plan to do next?” Lin Youlian asked solemnly.

“Brother, are you going to guard this position?” Bai Mifan was also curious.

Ling Han pondered for a bit, and then shook his head.

It would be a waste for him to just guard this spot.

With him around, the defenses in the area definitely could not be breached. However, the crux of the war was on the main battlefield. If they were to fall on the main battlefield, what use would there be to protect this place?

“I want… to head into Hysteria’s depths from here,” Ling Han said.

‘What?!’

The four prodigies were shocked. This was such a crazy idea.

That was Hysteria’s territory. Once they entered there, they would no longer be able to extract the Powers of Dimension, causing their strength to fall. Going there was certain death for anyone other than the immortal Seventh Tiers.

They admitted that Ling Han was very powerful, enough to go toe to toe with some of the older generation Seventh Tiers or even surpass them. However, when it came to fighting against Hysteria?

No one believed he could do it. No matter how monstrous he was, he needed to at least reach the Seventh Tier. That was because Hysteria was also an overwhelmingly powerful monster itself.

“Brother Ling, you shouldn’t be hasty.” Lin Youlian tried to dissuade him.

“That’s right, Brother. You need to think this through,” Bai Mifan chimed in.

Ling Han smiled. “Don’t worry. Hysteria won’t kill me that easily.”

His Powers of Dimension had coalesced into a single force, and he didn’t need to rely on the Profound Negative Realm anymore. No matter where he battled, he would not suffer a reduction in strength.

As such, he dared to venture into Hysteria’s territory and have a look for himself at the monstrous being that formed its body into a whole dimension.

Lin Youlian and Bai Mifan still tried to dissuade Ling Han, and even Xin Qihu was giving him a stern warning while pinching his nose. However, Ling Han had already made up his mind.

He continued on his path alone, and walked towards the distance.

Everyone watched him leave from atop the city walls, feeling both a sense of worry and excitement in their hearts. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They were worried because Hysteria was too powerful. It was undoubtedly the strongest existence alive. Meanwhile, Ling Han was not a true Seventh Tier, and without true immortality, there would always be a sense of fear when facing Hysteria.

On the other hand, they were excited because they had always been oppressed by Hysteria, and now was their chance to strike back.

Ling Han left as though drifted by the wind, but would he ever return?

With great strides, he stepped forward, full of confidence.

One step followed another, and despite not looking like he was going very fast, each step he took transcended millions and millions of miles. In less than half a day, he found himself entering a strange and colorful world.

This place was covered in darkness.

He felt as though he had entered a giant bug’s nest. The ground beneath him was uneven with many holes, and so was the case for the ceiling and the walls surrounding him.

This place was deathly silent, without any sense of life at all.

There were no living creatures or plants. It just seemed like a desolate wasteland.

However, Ling Han doubted that was actually the case. If this place was as desolate as it looked, then it could not be called a dimension.

After a short journey, he finally noticed a different scenery.

There was a plant… or something that looked like a plant. It was over 300 meters tall, and was completely black. It had leaves, but they were in the shape of different weapons, giving the plant a very peculiar look.

There were also giant fruits about three meters in length and two meters in width. They dangled from various branches on the plant.

‘What is this? A Celestial fruit?’

Ling Han approached, channeling his protective technique in the meanwhile. Four orbs of light surrounded him, forming a barrier in the shape of a tetrahedron, and effectively shielding Ling Han from all manners of attack.

He then reached out and pressed on one of the fruits.

Bo. The shell of the fruit pulsated slightly.

Ling Han was surprised. He couldn’t understand what was happening.

Using his finger like a knife, he slashed across the fruit, ripping it open instantly. A large amount of fluid oozed out, and then something about 30 centimeters tall suddenly charged out.

Ling Han couldn’t help raising an eyebrow. This was one of the early forms for Hysteria’s monsters.

Evidently, the creature was still very young. Its strength had only reached the Third Heaven of the Celestial King Tier, but it was already full of malice, biting at Ling Han ferociously.

Pa. Ling Han casually stomped it to death.

There was no blood rain from the skies. It seemed like the heavens didn’t care about this life.

That was understandable. This dimension was Hysteria’s true body, and these creatures were its soldiers. Why would it mourn if only one of them had died?

Ling Han took another look around his surroundings. There were countless plants in the area. Some looked similar to the one before him, while others were like vines. They stretched over the wall, their fruits dangling down from above. There were countless numbers of these fruits before Ling Han’s eyes.

Was this the place where Hysteria produced its massive army?

They were not born out of thin air, but birthed in such a way.

Ling Han scoffed and swiped the air with his finger, his powerful sword qi lashing out. Pa, pa, pa. He cut down a great number of these plants. He also imbued his sword qi with karmic flames, burning all the plants to ashes.

The fruits naturally could not escape their fate, either. The sword qi was so powerful that it instantly killed many of the monsters inside the fruits. There were some that managed to escape being cut, but they would soon burn to ashes under the unending flames of tribulation.

“Chi!” A loud screech resounded as monsters started popping out from the holes on the ground and the sky.

These were clearly the adult forms of the monsters. They had all reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier and emitted a powerful aura.

As it turned out, once they emerged from the fruit, they would bury themselves in holes. As soon as Hysteria gave the command, they would simultaneously move out.
