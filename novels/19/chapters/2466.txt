Chapter 2467: Conquering a base for fun

Grandmaster Ling?

The other Celestial King and Yang Gang both turned to look at Ling Han. This was only a Pseudo-Celestial King. How was he worthy of being addressed as “Grandmaster” by a Celestial King?

The other Celestial King looked towards Ling Han, and said after a slight pause, “Friend Zhu, this is…” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

There were two Celestial Kings on the other side, and their operations would possibly be affected. However, if their companion could make the Celestial King on the other side betray his side, in a battle of three against one, their chances of victory could not be any more assured.

This outsider Celestial King bore the surname of Zhu, and his name was Zhu Zixi. He chuckled, and made introductions for both sides while introducing himself as well. “Grandmaster Ling, I am Zhu Zixi. This is Lu Ming, Friend Lu. Friend Lu, this is Grandmaster Ling, the youngest Five-Star Alchemist in the history of our Eastern Celestial Realm, and is presently also the only Five-Star Alchemist.”

“Oh, so it is Grandmaster Ling!” Lu Ming hurriedly bowed towards Ling Han, appearing very polite.

There weren’t any Five-Star Alchemists on the Celestial Path, so everyone naturally did not know how they were supposed to treat a Five-Star Alchemist, but for the sake of Zhu Zixi and Bewitching Maiden Rou, Lu Ming was willing to see Ling Han as an equal.

Of course, if he knew that Ling Han’s Vitality Index was actually as high as 5600 points, and his strength was far superior, this “Grandmaster Ling” would be even more polite and respectful.

As he saw it, to lower himself to the same level was already giving Ling Han enough face. What else could he ask for?

Ling Han could tell what he was thinking, and only responded with a slight smile. “Friend Lu.”

Yang Gang frowned. If these few people cultivated relations, his situation would become worse. Though it was impossible that he would die, there was a 99% chance that he would not be able to keep this base. He hurriedly said, “Grandmaster Ling, there was some neglect in my reception just now. Please bear with me.”

All he had to do was cause a delay. As long as he could delay until his reinforcements came, he naturally would not have any more lingering worries.

Ling Han chuckled. “I have already said before. We are only passing by and will not interfere. You guys just continue doing whatever you will.”

......

“Since that is the case…” Lu Ming immediately looked menacingly towards Yang Gang. As long as Bewitching Maiden Rou did not interfere, they, two Celestial Kings, naturally had a full chance of victory.

Yang Gang could also accept this result. He was sure he could delay until reinforcements came.

Boom, Lu Ming was the first to move. He sent out a palm strike with his right palm, extracting the Regulations of Water, which turned into a colossal spear of ice, stabbing towards Yang Gang. Zhu Zixi did not stand idly, either. He, too, extracted Regulations, and black flames immediately rose from the ground as gravity soared countless times in a split second. Even a Celestial King would have trouble moving.

Yang Gang frowned. The cooperation between them was quite good. One was responsible for restraining the target, with the Regulations of Gravity limiting his mobility, while the other was responsible for attacking. The ice spear was cold and menacing, capable of freezing even Celestial King blood.

Fortunately, Zhu Zixi was a weakness. He had the aptitude of an emperor tier, but because he had just broken through to the Celestial King Tier, his battle prowess was far weaker than Yang Gang’s. Hence, this kind of limitation was not hard for Yang Gang to dispel.

WIth a burst of power and a flash of gleaming silver, he aggressively charged out, and shot out a punch. A golden sword formed out of nowhere, greeting the spear of ice.

Boom!

The golden sword and icy spear clashed, and both immediately crumbled, turning into Regulations which returned to the heaven and earth.

Yang Gang was slightly weaker. After all, he had been disturbed by Zhu Zixi, and could not unleash his full battle prowess.

This result was also within the expectations of the three great Celestial Kings. Hence, none of them showed any hint of shock or disappointment, and battle arose once more.

The three great Celestial Kings battled fiercely. Yang Gang was constantly at a disadvantage, but he was also defending very stubbornly. Going by the look of things now, there was absolutely no problem for him to last a few or even over a dozen days.

Hence, even though Yang Gang was clearly being suppressed, his expression was completely calm. It would only take around two days at most for the reinforcements to arrive.

“Hehe, did you think that there would be reinforcements?” Lu Ming smirked. “I don’t mind telling you. This time, we have mobilized a total of six Celestial Kings, and we are attacking three of your bases at the same time. Now, the two nearest bases should be waiting earnestly for reinforcements as well, so just give up.”

Hearing these words, Yang Gang couldn’t help but look stunned. If it was really like what the other party said, the situation was really too bad.

“Humph, the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King has only recruited 18 Celestial Kings, and has now sent out six of them all in one stroke. Doesn’t he worry that his base would be left undefended?” Yang Gang asked darkly. The more terrible his situation was, the more he could not allow himself to panic.

Lu Ming laughed loudly. “There is no need for Brother Yang to worry about that!”

The Peaceful Underworld Celestial King was the strongest Celestial King of Lu Ming’s party. He was at the peak stage of the Third Heaven, and naturally belonged to the strongest ranks on the Celestial Path. The strongest Celestial King of the party that Yang Gang belonged to was the Ninth Descent Celestial King, who similarly was at the peak stage of the Third Heaven—without this kind of cultivation level, they would not be worthy of commanding a troop of Celestial Kings.

Yang Gang frowned deeply. What gave the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King the right to be so daring? It should be known that they were all contending, and judging by the present situation, whoever had hold of more bases would possess a stronger say.

Now that the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King had sent out six Celestial Kings, their base naturally had to be absolutely empty. No matter what, it did not seem logical.

“Hehe, the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King can ally with the Crimson Snow Celestial King, so how could it be that the Ninth Descent Celestial King can’t?” A voice suddenly rang out from outside, and a man enshrouded in a peculiar light strode inside from the window, a calm smile adorning his face.

“Friend Qian!” Yang Gang was immediately overjoyed.

This newly arrived Celestial King was named Qian Xiang, and was also of the line of the Ninth Descent Celestial King. Of course, he was not a subordinate. Everyone had only formed a temporary alliance for the sake of contending for that “treasure” that would help them leave the Celestial Path.

“Qian Xiang!” Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed instantly. Not only had the former’s arrival thrown a wrench into their plans, the words that the other party had said had also shocked him greatly.

The reason why the line of the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King had been able to sent over six Celestial Kings was because they had formed an alliance with the line of the Crimson Snow Celestial King, but they had never imagined that the Ninth Descent Celestial King had also formed an alliance of mutual attack and defense with other forces. Their previous advantage was now completely gone.

“Hahahaha!” Yang Gang laughed loudly. “Come, come, come. Since you guys want a battle, let us battle to the fullest!”

Zhu Zixi’s eyes turned, and he said, “Grandmaster Ling, we are all residents of the Celestial Realm, so please lend me a helping hand! The Peaceful Underworld Celestial King only wishes to leave the Celestial Path, and that is the same for myself as well, so we decided to rake in some treasures while we were at it. However, we definitely have no desire for that perfect Celestial Seed. Thus, as long as Grandmaster Ling is willing to lend us some help, I have great confidence that I can convince the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King to gift this Celestial Seed to Grandmaster Ling.”

Hearing his words, both Yang Gang and Qian Xiang frowned. Now, it was a battle of two against two, and the number of Celestial Kings on both sides was equal, but if Ling Han and his group joined either side…

Mainly, it was about Bewitching Maiden Rou. She was a Celestial King, and whichever side she joined, that side would be able to gain a complete advantage.

“Grandmaster Ling, we can offer such conditions as well!” Yang Gang said immediately. Naturally, there was no way he could allow Zhu Zixi to pull a Celestial King over to their side.

“Grandmaster Ling, please believe in me!”

“Grandmaster Ling, we have greater sincerity.”

Both sides were stretching out an olive branch to Ling Han. Of course, they had ulterior motives. Their main purpose was to get hold of the Celestial King Tier battle prowess represented by Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Ling Han smiled, and said to the Empress and the others, “Why don’t we, too, conquer a base for fun?”
