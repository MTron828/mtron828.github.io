Chapter 1093: Entering the Large Tomb

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was almost impossible to cultivate in space, as no Spiritual Qi existed there. One could only replenish their power through True Origin Stones. Alchemical pills would also work, though this was much more luxurious.

Ling Han was an exception.

There were far too many people here, so no one would notice if a few people disappeared. Thus, he could enter his Black Tower and cultivate under the Reincarnation Tree whenever he wanted. The Rain Emperor and the others were also cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree.

They replenished their power using True Origin Stones, and they increased the speed of their cultivation by taking alchemical pills. Thanks to the existence of the Reincarnation Tree, they didn’t need to worry about this affecting their growth, either.

Ling Han focused on refining pills. He could only purchase Godly metal if he had enough money, and he could only raise the level of his Divine Demon Sword if he had enough Godly metal.

Not having enough money seemed like an eternal problem.

However, even though he wasn’t cultivating, his progress was the quickest out of everyone.

There was nothing surprising about this. After all, he had a wisp of a Demon Master’s essence in his body. This continually provided him with an essence power, causing his cultivation to progress even when he was sleeping. As long as he spent some time comprehending dao under the Reincarnation Tree every day, his cultivation level would be able to match his mind and comprehension. There wasn’t any risk or danger.

He would be able to reach the middle stage of the high extreme after another month or so.

Time trickled, and the fog of chaos enveloping the main entrance gradually dissipated, revealing the entrance to an abyss.

From afar, this entrance looked like a passageway. However, it was actually shockingly huge. It was like an ocean, and even starships would be able to navigate inside easily. It merely looked small due to the humongous size of the large tomb.

The great elites conducted numerous experiments, attempting to navigate unmanned starships into the entrance. After several attempts, they finally managed to succeed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Instantly, the starships all headed toward the entrance.

The city-sized starships were like ants crawling into a mug when they flew into the entrance—the disparity in size was simply astounding.

Everyone was filled with anticipation.

This was a tomb built among the stars, a tomb carved from a planet. What kind of supreme figure was buried in this tomb?

Meanwhile, Ling Han sighed with emotion. So what if one was at the Genesis Tier? They would still reach the end of their life one day. In the end, their greatness and might would eventually transform into dirt on the ground.

Were there truly eternal beings in the world?

The starship had already navigated through the entrance as he pondered this. The interior was pitch-black, and only the light radiating from the starship illuminated a small region in the surroundings. He immediately felt a soft body leaning against him—it was none other than Shui Yanyu.

Ling Han wrapped his arms around this seductive beauty, and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll look after you!”

Shui Yanyu nodded. In fact, she had rarely ever ventured out for training. Before such a magnificent and mighty structure, she couldn’t help but feel incredibly small and insignificant.

The starship continued forward, and after flying for a few more hours, it arrived before a continent.

A continent appearing in a large tomb was extremely strange. However, this was possibly the tomb of a great elite, so was the existence of a continent really all that extraordinary?

Great elites naturally had their own abilities!

The starships that had arrived earlier had already docked in especially neat rows. Many people had already disembarked, and were currently exploring the continent. The surroundings were dimly lit in this place, though this was enough for Immortal level cultivators to see clearly.

“There’s actually breathable air!” Ling Han took a deep breath. Although he didn’t need to breathe, breathing had already become a habit, so he would still breathe whenever he could. It wasn’t necessary, yet it would make him feel much more comfortable.

“Be careful!” Shui Yanyu nudged him and signaled toward a starship that had just passed. There was a flag flying above the starship, and there was a clear “Zhao” written on the flag.

This was Great General Zhao’s starship, and Zhao Lun had just disembarked. He was walking behind a tall and slim male, and his expression was incredibly respectful.

‘Huh? Wasn’t this Great General severely wounded? Why is he heading out so soon?

‘It seems that this large tomb is far too tempting. Even the recuperating Great General Zhao couldn’t resist its attraction.’

Ling Han nodded in acknowledgment. Zhao Lun would be even more brazen here, and if they came across each other alone, he didn’t believe that Great General Zhao would give him any face. He had humiliated Zhao Lun several times, after all, and Zhao Lun was even the only child of Great General Zhao. It would be strange if the latter wasn’t ticked off.

The starship docked, and everyone disembarked with enthusiasm.

However, the starship instantly turned around to return after everyone had disembarked—heavens knew how many more people on the Joint Peace Planet were still waiting to come over. Thus, it was only natural that the starship would try to make a few more round trips, making a huge profit in the process.

Moreover, they didn’t sell return tickets, but rather one-way tickets. If one wanted to return to the Joint Peace Planet, then thank you, please continue to pay.

Ling Han determined his bearings, yet direction was of little use in this place—everything was relative.

“The Spiritual Qi here is extremely thin, so it’s completely unsuitable for cultivation. However, this place is also swarming with life essence, so it can also be said that it’s a holy land for cultivation. How strange,” Ling Han said.

“Where should we go?” Shui Yanyu asked.

“Let’s head to a place with no one first so we can let Big Brother and the others out.” Ling Han looked around. Many people had come here, yet due to the huge size of this continent, it seemed like there was only an insignificant amount of people.

The two of them continued forward. Ling Han was just about to let Feng Po Yun and the others out, yet he suddenly frowned and looked behind.

“You people have followed us for quite some time!” Ling Han said calmly.

Four men had appeared behind them at some point in time. They looked to be around 30 years old, and they were all at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. However, one’s age couldn’t be determined by their appearance after they advanced into the Immortal level.

Judging by vigorous vitality, however, they were indeed middle-aged men. They were probably around 20,000 years old.

“Brat, you can f*ck off now. As for this beauty, hehe... We’ll make sure to look after her!” The four men roared with laughter.

Ling Han shook his head. Trash truly did exist everywhere. They had only just entered the large tomb, yet they had already come across four perverted bastards.

“You’re still not f*cking off?!”

“Holy sh*t! I had to hold myself back for several days on the ship. Now that there’s such a beauty before me, how can I contain myself?”

“Hehe, Third Brother, you’ve never been able to fix this habit of yours! If you’re truly desperate, you can take the backdoor of this brat. Otherwise, you’re third in line, so won’t your little buddy burst in lust when you see Big Brother and me enjoying ourselves?”

“F*ck off! I’m not gay!”

The four men were wanton and unrestrained, their speech full of vulgarity and profanity. Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were only at the high extreme and medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier, respectively, so the four should have absolutely no trouble suppressing them.

“Big Brother, it seems like this brat wants to resist.”

“Then kill him. This beauty is truly seductive. I can’t contain myself any longer!”

The four men attacked together. They clearly had higher cultivation levels, yet they still insisted on ganging up on Ling Han. It was clear that they had already made a habit of this. Rules and whatnot were all troublesome. Disposing of their opponents as quickly as possible was the most important thing.

Ling Han humphed, and drew his Divine Demon Sword. Sword Rays swept out as he charged toward the four men.

“Yi?”

“En?”

“Ya?”

The four men all yelped in astonishment. They hadn’t expected for Ling Han to be so powerful, and realized that he was a troublesome opponent once he launched an attack.

However, he was only a little troublesome. After all, he was merely at the high extreme.

“Humph! Your cultivation levels are so much higher, yet you still want to attain victory by ganging up on him. Do you people know no shame?” A voice that was filled with haughtiness traveled over, quickly followed by the appearance of a youth striding over. He had long green hair, and there was divine light flashing across his body.

There were 10 or so youths following behind him, all of them wearing respectful expressions. It was clear that this green-haired youth was their leader.
