Chapter 322: People with the Same Pursuit

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

These three strong prodigies all had the cultivation of the seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, it was quite surprising.

Bai Ming showed no sign of weakness and looked towards Yang Chong, and Yang Chong did the same. One reached towards the sword hilt, and the other reached towards the spear, burning with desire for battle almost as if they were going up in flames.

But at last, they didn’t make a move, only looking at each other deeply before they entered the forest on their own.

The exam just started, it was too early to fight. Even if they won, they wouldn’t obtain many tokens, and instead they would just reveal their own trump cards; they weren’t the only prodigies here.

“That tanned brother.” Within the shouting, a fat and round youngster ran over almost as if he was rolling, stopping in front of Ling Han, panting. “You’re too unfriendly, not even waiting for Treasure Master.”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You still dare to show up? Aren’t you afraid of your shady business being exposed and being chased after by people?”

“Pah, where have I lied?” Ma Duo Bao sneered. “Treasure Master never cheats in his dealings, don’t you ruin Treasure Master’s reputation.”

“Hold it, do you even have any reputation?” Ling Han shook his head.

“Black Brother, how about we join hands?” Ma Duo Bao came closer. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Why?” Ling Han asked. “You’re covered with jewels and pearls from head to toe, and you still need to join hands?”

If he didn’t unleash Demon Birth Sword, even he couldn’t deal with all of Ma Duo Bao’s Spirit Tools.

“Hehe, Black Brother, wouldn’t you want to do a huge business deal?” Ma Duo Bao smiled evilly, moved his head closer, and said in a low voice, “Don’t tell me that you’re not interested in the medicinal garden here!”

Ling Han was shocked. He said, “You want to steal from the medicinal garden here? Such great nerve.”

“Hehe, we’re people with the same pursuit; the second in line doesn’t tell off the boss!” Ma Duo Bao cupped his hands in salute to Ling Han, and said, “How about it, how about it? Treasure Master is most adept in lifting restrictions. What can you do?”

Ling Han scratched his head, and said, “From where did you get that I looked like a thief, and how come you’re admitting it all on your own?”

Ma Duo Bao laughed out loud and said, “All right, all right. Treasure Master’s done business for so many years, so the moment you lift your butt, Treasure Master will know what kind of crap you defecate. Like I said, we’re people with the same pursuit, yet you try to cover it up. Are you not regarding Treasure Master as a friend?”

Ling Han rolled his eyes and said, “We were never friends!”

“Unfamiliar at first, but well accustomed soon enough, aren’t we already friends?” Ma Duo Bao looked at Ling Han twice more. “This disguise technique of yours is really not bad, even almost deceiving Treasure Master.”

This time, Ling Han was truly shocked—the other party could actually see through his disguise?

He activated the Eye of Truth and looked towards Ma Duo Bao, but Ma Duo Bao reached out to cover his face—the lines of fabric on his sleeves emitted a faint light, making even Ling Han’s Eye of Truth unable to penetrate it.

“Wow, what luck you have to actually have gotten the Eye of Truth! Hahaha, now Treasure Master has complete certainty. You”ll be responsible for using your eye, and Treasure Master will be responsible for using his hands. I promise you that we’ll steal the medicinal garden till it’s barren,” Ma Duo Bao said excitedly.

A coldness arose within Ling Han’s heart. This guy could recognize the Eye of Truth with one glance—was he really just a youngster? If he could disguise himself, why couldn’t the other party? However, when they entered the mountain gates, a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator appeared. He might have looked unperturbed, but if a person with makeup surpassing the age limit were hidden in the crowd, he would definitely have found out at once.

Young or not could be seen from one’s life force. The various functions of the bodies of those past thirty would start going on a down slope and their life force would appear to be on a downward trend as long as they didn’t enter Flower Blossom Tier, which was completely different from the vigor of youngster.

However, if Ma Duo Bao was an old monster in disguise, and could deceive a Flower Blossom Tier practitioner’s eyesight, what cultivation was he at?

Ling Han thought to himself, and said, “Alright, then let’s join hands.” He was very interested in emptying the Winter Moon Sect’s medicinal garden.

Yu Long Mountains were the Winter Moon Sect’s private property, and in order to avoid people from sneaking into the mountains to dig up herbs and hunt monsters, the entire mountain range was protected by a mountain-protecting formation. If one tried to break through it with external power, the Winter Moon Sect would definitely be alarmed.

However, they already entered the Winter Moon Sect, so they weren’t scared of tripping the formation. As long as they had the ability to open up the medicinal garden’s restriction, they could easily rob the medicinal garden empty.

They looked at each other, both starting to laugh.

As they advanced, it was clear Ma Duo Bao had done the groundwork, staying in front to lead the way and walking in a fixed direction.

“Stop there, hand over you tokens, and I can spare you your lives.” However, after they walked for a while, they encountered a small team in ambush. A total of thirty-four people began to surround them.

“You go or I go?” Ling Han said smiling at Ma Duo Bao

“Treasure Master is only interested in Treasures, just keep the tokens for yourself.” Ma Duo Bao shrugged.

As expected, this guy came especially for the Winter Moon Sect’s medicinal garden. Earlier, he probably scammed other people’s Origin Crystals on a whim, and thought that it was dumb not to take advantages when there was a chance.

Ling Han looked towards those people and said with a smile, “Now it’s a robbery. Get a bit more serious, and hand over all of your tokens.”

Those people were fuming with anger. They were the ones that was doing the robbery, alright?

“If you must go about it the hard way... Brothers, kill him!” These people waved their sabers and swords and charged over.

Ling Han frowned. If these people were just robbing, then he wouldn’t mind robbing back and letting them live. However, these people now bared their killing intent, already harboring the thought to kill.

He snorted and tapped the sword’s sheath with his left hand. Xiu , the long sword instantly bounced out, seized by his hands, and with a shua , a dazzling sword light swept across.

Pu, pu, pu, pu, fresh blood splattered everywhere. Traces of blood appeared on their right shoulders which immediately hung limply, the weapons in their hands instantly falling onto the ground as cries were heard one after another.

Ma Duo Bao clapped as he said, “Good job on acting cool, I give you ten points!”

Ling Han still didn’t kill them in the end, so settled for only crippling their right arms. It wouldn’t affect their movements hereafter, but they wouldn’t ever be able to use violence. He said indifferently, “Leave your tokens and get lost.”

These people knew they encountered an expert; with pale faces, they hurriedly placed their tokens together and ran right away without saying a word.

Now they were simply injured, and if they still weren’t sensible, then they might also lose their lives.

They ran backwards one after another. With their arms crippled, what the hell was the point in fighting.

Ling Han picked up the tokens and put them away into the Black Tower. In front of Ma Duo Bao who was adorned with jewels and pearls, he wouldn’t mind revealing his possession of a spatial spirit tool; Ma Duo Bao definitely wouldn’t think of the Black Tower that could form its own world.

On the way, they encountered several more robberies. Ling Han normally wouldn’t kill, unless the other party had gone too far. For example, if others unleashed a fatal sneak attack, then he wouldn’t mind killing the other party with one strike.

After half a day, they finally arrived at a large medicine garden.
