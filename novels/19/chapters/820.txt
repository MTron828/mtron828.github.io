Chapter 821: Arriving at Cold City

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After this little interlude, Ling Han and the Lunar King set out on their journey.

Very soon, they arrived outside the regional barrier, yet discovered that the regional wall no longer existed.

“I found it troublesome, so I shattered it,” the Lunar King stated calmly.

Strong!

After that Reckoning ten thousand years ago, this should be something that the group from the Immortal Realm helped to construct, but she actually dismantled it, which was proof enough of how powerful this big vixen was.

They traveled unimpeded, and could see that this was already the territory of the Purple Moon Empire. The city ahead had already raised the national flag of the Purple Moon Empire, which looked very grand.

Another ten days later, they had arrived at the capital city of the Purple Moon Empire.

Ma Duo Bao came out personally to receive them, which was giving Ling Han enough face.

“Why do you look so highly on me, Brother Ma?” Ling Han asked in confusion. With his abilities, even if the sect leaders of all the five great sects came here, he did not even need to give them a second glance.

Ma Duo Bao laughed heartily. “My tanned brother, I have never looked wrongly on a person. You are fated to stir up the winds of destiny; your achievements will definitely not be lower than mine.”

Ling Han was feeling extremely pleased internally. He was also confident that he would be able to gain unprecedented accomplishments in the future, but before he reached this height, he was already treated as an equal by someone whose abilities were far superior to his. This naturally made him feel very comfortable.

However...

“Brother Ma, can you not call me your tanned brother anymore?”

“All right, my tanned brother!” Ma Duo Bao readily accepted, yet he was the standard type to never change his ways.

Ling Han was rendered momentarily speechless. After a while, he finally said, “Brother Ma, I can offer you some suggestions on the usage of power of the nation.”

“Oh, tell me about it.” Ma Duo Bao did not take Ling Han lightly.

Ling Han relayed all the information he had heard from Yi Shuang Shuang, causing Ma Duo Bao to immediately sink into deep thought.

“Sire, so the fact we failed at splitting open the skies the last time was your fault?” The Lunar King cracked her knuckles. “You damn fatty, you are indeed unreliable!”

Ma Duo Bao hurriedly raised his hands in surrender, and said, “Even if I had learnt the correct method the last time, we would still have failed.”

“Why?” the Lunar King turned a dangerous look on Ma Duo Bao, but did not move to attack.

Ma Duo Bao sighed, and said, “Even last time, I was almost filled to bursting point with power of the nation. Even if it was possible to increase power of the nation tenfold, I would not be able to bear it!”

The Lunar King stared blankly. After a while, she suddenly leaped up. She grabbed onto Ma Duo Bao’s face, and exclaimed, “You turned yourself into a damn fatty... are you cultivating some kind of weird cultivation technique to increase your tolerance level?”

“My beloved subject is indeed clever!” Ma Duo Bao had been squeezed into deformation, but he was still very amiable, and laughed. “At that time, we did not unify the seas, yet I had already reached my limit, so I did not command you all to set out on an expedition against the seas. Unfortunately, my ability was still not enough to split open the skies. Therefore, I recultivated my physique to be capable of bearing stronger power of the nation this time.”

All of a sudden, the Lunar King’s hands drooped and she stamped her feet as she said, “Give me back my handsome, suave Sire. Though looking at a fatty for a longer period of time makes it easier on the eyes, but how could it compare to how suave the original Sire looked like!” She immediately scrambled over to Ling Han’s side, grabbed him, and said viciously, “Little brother, you definitely must not follow that damn fatty. I do not want to see another damn fatty.”

Ling Han hurriedly raised his hands, smiled, and said, “Of course, of course!” He indeed did not want to become a damn fatty, either.

But what cultivation technique was Ma Duo Bao actually cultivating that it used the fattening of one’s body to increase the toughness of his physique?

“After improvement, perhaps merely the power of the nation of the middle state would be enough to fill me to bursting point!” Ma Duo Bao rubbed his chin. From Ling Han’s experience, building the totem before congealing the will of the people would be enough to increase power of the nation by tenfold.

After all, the middle state was the haven of martial arts. A single state was enough to match four regions combined, so if power of the nation was increased another tenfold, the effects would definitely be double or even triple when he united the whole mainland.

Although his physique had been improved, but was it twice or thrice stronger than before?

“We’ll just try and see.” Ma Duo Bao immediately began constructing the totem. This symbolized the image of the whole nation, so he had to consider carefully.

Now, the Purple Moon Empire had already occupied over ninety percent of the actual land of the middle state. Only small parts the five great sects were occupying had yet to change their flag. However, the five sects’ territories were not far from one another, so they could support each other. It was very, very difficult if they wanted to conquer any of them.

Such a small place, yet there were gathered over a hundred Shattering Void Tier elites. There were also powerful ultimate tools like the Absolute Saber and the Mountain and River Axe, so they were definitely not easy opponents. It was necessary for Ma Duo Bao to act personally.

The final major battle was not far.

Taking advantage of this time before the final battle began, Ling Han decided to make a trip to Cold City.

There were two Cold Spear Associations there, which were connected to a few of his disciples, so he needed to clarify things.

He brought Zhu Xuan Er, Hu Niu, and the others and set out. A few days later, they arrived at Cold City.

Before that, Ling Han only knew that the Cold Spear Association was in Cold City, but he did not have a very clear memory of where exactly Cold City was. It lasted only until the moment he arrived here, when he could not help but look distracted as if he had transmigrated through time and returned to the past. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Cold City was Eternal Light City of ten thousand years ago, and also the place where he had lived.

He had never thought that after ten thousand years, this city would still remain, and had not been destroyed. Ling Han could still recognize some broken parts of the city walls, and they were no different from ten thousand years ago.

“Ling Han, what’s the matter?” Hu Niu asked, tugging at his hand.

“Nothing.” Ling Han smiled, and walked into the city holding onto Hu Niu’s hand.

He was heading straight for the Cold Spear Association.

However, there were two Cold Spear Associations in Cold City. One was in the south of the city, and was named the Southern Spear Association, whereas the other was in the north, and so was called the Northern Spear Association. The two Cold Spear Associations both claimed that they were the real Cold Spear Association, and were frequently involved in tussles with each other, nursing an unending feud between them.

Ling Han had come in from the eastern gate, so it was about the same distance whichever Cold Spear Association he went to. He took out a copper coin, and smiled. “If its heads, we’ll head to the Southern Spear Association, and if it’s tails, we’ll head to the Northern Spear Association.”

In the end, it was tails.

He walked neither too fast nor too slow. However, the city was only so big, so he arrived at the Northern Spear Association not long later.

“I want to see someone who can speak up around here,” Ling Han said to the guards standing at the entrance.

“Who are you?” the guard retorted, his face wearing a disdainful smile. This was natural. If any random person could just come over and demand to see their boss, what did they think their boss was?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “My name is Ling Han. Just go ahead and announce it just like that.”

“Ling Han!” The guard started. The members of the Cold Spear Association naturally understood. The purpose they existed was to gather anything related to Ling Han, obtaining them at all costs.

Of course, this Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor of ten thousand years ago, and not this young man in front of him.

In the hearts of every member of the Cold Spear Association, the Ling Han from ten thousand years ago was a supreme existence. He was like a god that could not have sacrilege committed against him, and this man actually dared call himself Ling Han as well; this was too despicable!

He gave Ling Han a look, and said, “All right, I will go in and announce you!”

Heng , if he did not call out elites to beat this guy so hard that his own mother wouldn’t recognize him, there would be something wrong with him!
