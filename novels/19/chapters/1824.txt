Chapter 1825: Monarch tier?

Actually, Luo Changfeng was quite depressed.

He had at first thought that he would definitely come first this time round, and the only one that could rival him would be Zihe Bingyun. But when he came out of the Ascending Dragon Palace, he realized that he kept falling behind.

...Ling Han was the one who had discovered the entrance to this place, and he had brought a huge group of people with him.

At first, he thought he would be the first to find the Heavenly Dao Jade once they had gone separate ways, but reality had proven that he hadn’t even been anywhere close. If it were not for the fact that he had encountered Zihe Bingyun, he still would not know that it was highly possible that the Heavenly Dao Jade would be hidden inside this mountain cave, and the way to open it was through the Mountain Treasure.

...And now? Even in the case of the Mountain Treasure, Ling Han was still the first to find it.

It’s fine, it’s fine, Luo Changfeng said to himself. Though he kept falling behind, as long as he could pull off a comeback at the last moments, and take possession of the Heavenly Dao Jade, what harm would be done?

It was not that he had not been suspicious of the fact that Zihe Bingyun had purposely informed him of such precious intel. Perhaps this was only a lie, but Zihe Bingyun had plucked out a sliver of her memories for his viewing. That was the information that she had obtained after plucking the souls of the tribe of dwarves.

Thus, though Luo Changfeng was still slightly hesitant, he would still enshroud this mountain cave with his divine sense every day.

He had not thought that Ling Han had really brought the Mountain Treasure with him just after a few days.

Haha, the Heavenly Dao Jade was his now!

Facing Ling Han, he naturally was filled with superiority. Previously, Ling Han had obediently let him through, which meant that the latter feared his status as the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier sect. Furthermore, he was an emperor tier-level prodigy!

“Scram!” he demanded arrogantly.

Ling Han slanted a sideways glance at him. Did this guy really think that he was all that awesome? He laughed, and said, “Come, demonstrate to me how the action of scramming is done. If you perform well enough, I will reward you.”

Luo Changfeng was taken aback before coming to realization.

‘F***, you actually dare to mock me?’

“You are very outrageously brazen!” Luo Changfeng smirked coldly, but did not get angry. It was not worth his while. What kind of esteemed existence was he? If he were to squabble with a nameless character, that would really be attaching too much importance to Ling Han.

If he didn’t like him, he merely had to erase him directly.

“Thankfully that guy is not here, or you would have to be cautious about your behind by now,” Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. The word ‘dog’ could not be spoken spontaneously.

What did that mean?

‘Hiss, it can’t be that you are coveting my behind? Pervert!’

Luo Changfeng’s killing intent involuntarily blazed. This guy actually dared have ideas about him; he was really courting death! He humphed, and said, “Since you are so determined to seek your own death, then I’ll just—”

Xiu, he had not even finished his words when he saw that Ling Han had already charged over to him. He had shot out a palm strike, which was descending straight down onto his head.

Luo Changfeng was furious. ‘Just who do you think you are that you actually dare take the initiative to make a move on me?

‘Die!’

He extended his index and middle fingers, and waved at Ling Han. An image of a star appeared at the tips of his fingers, exuding an astonishing aura.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and both of them trembled before taking a few steps backwards.

They had actually ended up in a tie!

Luo Changfeng’s whole expression immediately became incredibly colorful. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He had indeed witnessed the strength of Ling Han’s physique before, but it was only that. In terms of battle prowess, Ling Han was not just a little bit weaker than him, especially when he had now reached the third severance peak stage. He was now even more confident that he could suppress everything else.

But Ling Han was actually capable of matching him!

He could not believe it.

What was even more frightening was the fact that the ripple of the other’s aura was clearly only in the third severance early stage!

Third severance early stage, and he was already capable of matching him? It should be known that he was a king among kings. To say nothing of being invincible among his peers, even with the gap of a cultivation level, he was still able to suppress king tiers.

Previously, it was always he that would be fighting those in a higher cultivation level than himself, but now the tables were turned, and this was a massive blow to his confidence.

On the sidelines, Bewitching Maiden Rou had also gone numb with shock.

In a battle of equals, it was still Luo Changfeng who was actually at an advantage in cultivation level, but the result of the clash was a tie. Then, if their cultivation level was completely equal, wouldn’t it be Ling Han who would be slightly superior?

This guy was too freakish; he was actually stronger than even the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier-level sect!

There was no fear of ignorance, only fear of comparison. Two great emperor tiers were existences that blinded the whole world with their brilliance. Individually, which of them was not incredibly outstanding? But when put together and compared, which was the better would be immediately clear.

“Monarch tier?” Luo Changfeng’s voice trembled slightly, but was filled even more with jealousy.

King tiers could be invincible among their peers, and king among kings, or emperor tiers, could be invincible even with a gap of a minor level, and as for monarch tier... they would be invincible even with the gap of two minor levels!

In truth, the number of king tiers was very limited. Ordinarily, only three-star forces could nurture such prodigies. As for a sect? They would only have four or five. At most, it would not exceed 10, and in terms of emperor tier, that could only be found in Celestial King Tier great forces.

...Occasionally, this kind of prodigy would appear in four-star forces, but it was incredibly lucky for even one to appear.

But as for monarch tiers?

Heh, that could only possibly appear in those top-tier Celestial King Tier forces.

Such as Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level!

Though there was a Celestial King in the ranks of the Thundercloud Palace, this Celestial King was only a Second Heaven Celestial King, and was who knew how far away from the Ninth Heaven.

There were Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and every single step forwards was as difficult as ascending the heavens!

But now, it was possible that a young monarch tier had appeared in front of him.

“Just who exactly are you?” Luo Changfeng asked darkly. He was an emperor tier, after all, so though he was shocked, he did not panic.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Ling Han, a mere commoner. There is no need for you to take me to heart.”

How could he not take it to heart?

Luo Changfeng stared coldly at Ling Han. Was there really such a freakish person that could become a monarch tier through his own talent and effort?

That was not right, what was a monarch tier?

He would have to be a fifth severance, but Ling Han was clearly only in the third severance, and could only be considered an emperor tier.

Since there were weaker and stronger king tiers, why wouldn’t there be a difference of quality among emperor tiers?

“Since you are just a commoner, then please die!” Luo Changfeng’s arms shook. Ka, ka, ka. Golden light suddenly rose up from his arms, which turned into multiple symbols that stuck tightly onto his arms, forming a pair of arm guards.

He was just standing there proudly, but his whole figure was exuding a domineering aura that overwhelmed all else.

Zihe Bingyun had the supreme Regulations bestowed by a Celestial King, and what he had was this pair of arm guards. This was something that the Celestial King of Thundercloud Palace had used before, and a sliver of his aura was left in them. Though it was just a sliver, it was enough to sweep aside all opposition in the Severing Mundane Tier.

Anything that involved a Celestial King was always that awesome.

Luo Changfeng crooked his finger, his disdain seeping into his actions and words.

‘Aren’t you a commoner? Then I’ll just treat you like a commoner.’

Ling Han chuckled derisively, and merely looked at Luo Changfeng’s arm guards. This thing could be further refined by the Divine Demon Sword, which was great.

“In front of a Celestial King, every other existence is an ant!” Luo Changfeng said in an overbearing tone.

“So noisy, take a punch from me!” Ling Han charged out, two Source Powers entwined around his fists. This was enough to allow him to resist the aura of a Celestial King.

“You overestimate yourself!” Luo Changfeng smirked coldly, and also shot out both fists. One after another, the symbols on the arm guards lit up. The power of great dao was boundless, and that was an aura that could suppress the Severing Mundane Tier.

Ling Han was the type to become stronger with a strong foe. His two Source Powers were limited by his own cultivation level, and he could not express their full might, but when they encountered the “challenge” from the aura of a Celestial King, their might naturally increased.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow again. Their figures slid back respectively, and it ended in a tie once again.
