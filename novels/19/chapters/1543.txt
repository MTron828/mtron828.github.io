“What, this is actually stolen property?” What caused Ling Han to be stuck between laughter and tears was that Gou Li actually looked incredibly furious, and loudly shouted, “You brat, I was so kind to invite you to share some wine, and you actually allowed me to eat something that has been stolen!”He raised the roast meat in his hand high, and looked like he was going to throw it down. Then, after some thought, pa, he took a big bite. Immediately, grease spurted in all directions. As he chewed, he was still indistinctly muttering, “I look down on you! I especially disdain you!”

He looked again at that girl, and said, “Fairy, I support you, hit him!”

‘This...!’

Ling Han looked at Gou Li. Previously, he had thought that this was a savage that had walked out from the wilderness, and had a forthright and frank character, but in this moment, he understood just how gravely wrong his impression had been.

A book could not be judged by its cover. This f****** was a guy that would screw others over!

The girl also paused. All of a sudden, she could not judge the situation, but when she saw Gou Li was still eating ravenously, rage rose up in her heart involuntarily. Brandishing a sword, she delivered a slash. “Give me back my Green Treasure Chicken!”

This girl was extraordinary. As she shot out a slash, a galaxy appeared behind her. There were at least a few hundred heavenly bodies within.

Medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier!

Ling Han was surprised. It seemed like the overall level of cultivation here was not too bad. The first two people he encountered here were both in the Eternal River Tier. However, he hurriedly leaped away because this young girl treated him like Gou Li, and both of them became the target of her attacks.

“Fairy, you’re beating on the wrong person; this really has nothing to do with me! I only appeared at the wrong place at the wrong time.” Gou Li was also repeatedly dodging, but did not fight back.

This was precisely being partial to her from whom they had taken from. The man was really quite gentlemanly.

Ling Han was involuntarily struck speechless. This Gou Li was really shameless to a whole new level; he actually lied right in his face, and did not even blush.

“Just surrender and be captured!” The girl was exasperated as she wielded her sword in a dazzling, skilful manner. “Or I will kill both of you!”

She was really not just saying this. Multiple demonic patterns glowed on her sword’s blade, fully arousing the might within, causing her battle prowess to be uplifted to a new height.

Ling Han was a little strained.

His power was not inferior to her, but the gap in terms of Regulations was a little too big. He had just reached the middle stage of the low extreme, and so his grasp of Regulations was also limited to the early stage of the medium extreme. He did not have any more battle prowess than that.

Of course, this was his battle prowess, without considering the Nine Heavens Flame and the Limitless Nine Deaths Formation. His physique was also not taken into consideration. These trump cards were all unaffected by the Regulations of the Netherworld.

Gou Li saw how he was dodging and parrying the attacks with strain, and he involuntarily looked sympathetic. He said, “Brother, since you can’t hold on, don’t force yourself. Obediently apologize to this fairy, and the fairy would definitely take into account that this is your first offence and forgive you.”

The girl, meanwhile, was exploding in fury. She only had a total of five Green Treasure Chickens, and she had raised every single one of them with great care. Even she could not bear to eat them, yet now three of them had been stolen by these two thieves in one go, so how could she not be furious? She wanted nothing more than to tear the two of them into pieces.

“You were the one who stole it. I was just passing by, and was innocently dragged into the matter.” Ling Han sighed.

Gou Li, though, paled in shock. “Brother, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t irresponsibly speak as you wish. It was clearly you who is the chicken thief; why do you wrong me? What animosity do you have with me? Do you have to be like this?”

“What animosity do you have with me, then?” Ling Han asked, shaking his head with a smile. Though he was in a very sorry state now, he had even evaded being hunted down by a Saint, so he naturally would not take a cultivator in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier to heart.

“Surrender your life!” When the girl saw how they were pushing the blame onto each other, she couldn’t help but become even angrier. With a battle cry, an aura of ice surged from her, and the whole heaven and earth had become incredibly cold. It felt as if even divine blood would be frozen into ice.

“Discretion is the better part of valor, and no good man would fight with a woman. Brother, you hold on, I will leave first!” Gou Li swayed falsely, and turned around and fled.

But he had not run a few steps when he involuntarily gritted his teeth. Shaking his head, he asked, “Brother, what do you mean by running with me?”

“Nothing in particular. In any case, we are both running, so we can keep each other company.” Ling Han followed closely behind Gou Li. He naturally could not possibly stay there to continue being a target.

“But I do not want to be accompanied by you!” Gou Li exclaimed, hopping mad.

“Your objection is futile. Run, or she will catch up to us!” Ling Han said, smiling. Because Gou Li had been stomping in anger for a while, he had surpassed him, and the girl had already caught up with them. She slashed out with her sword, and froze the area.

Gou Li quickly ran like mad. He was actually following Ling Han. It was obvious that he had the same line of thought as Ling Han. He did not want to become an unfortunate fool that would continue to be a target. His shameless thought was that if I would be sinking, I would simply sink the whole ship as well.

“Brother, hold on, with company, you won’t be lonely!” he shouted.

“Scram, I don’t know you!” Ling Han waved him off.

“But I know you. Ling Han, Brother Ling, right?” Gou Li was still calling out from behind him. His voice was extraordinarily loud as if he was afraid that the young girl could not hear him clearly enough.

F***, this guy was definitely doing it deliberately.

“You chicken thief!” Ling Han exclaimed in reprimand.

“How could such a decent man like me pilfer!” Gou Li exclaimed resolutely, looking very righteous, while he was still eating the roast meat ravenously. He couldn’t help but praise, “So delicious!”

“Damn it! Damn it!” The girl behind them had already gone mad with fury. She continuously brandished her sword in strikes. She wanted to apprehend both Ling Han and Gou Li to “offer a sacrifice” to her Green Treasure Chickens.

Gou Li was even more infuriating. Not only was he still eating the chicken meat, he was even spitting out the bones over his shoulder like mad, causing the girl to become even more furious. Her whole head of raven locks was already standing on ends, becoming as white as snow.

“Water Heaven Art!” the girl shouted. She suddenly stopped, her left hand forming a seal. Weng, all the water vapor in the heaven and earth rose, becoming multiple crystalline structures. Every crystal contained a tiny imitation of her.

This was too compressed. Ling Han and Gou Li rushed forwards, and inevitably would have to crash into these crystals, and experience a sudden heavy blow right down on their heads.

But just at this moment, that terrifying physique of Ling Han’s showed its might. This kind of collision was completely harmless to him. He did not even have to slow his speed. Meanwhile, Gou Li was shouting loudly. He ran madly after Ling Han as if a fire was lit under him.

They soon rushed out of the area surrounded by the water crystals, and this girl had to execute this technique from the same spot to channel this technique. When she withdrew the technique and continued her pursuit, Ling Han and Gou Li were already an unknown distance away from her,

“Despicable thieves, I will definitely find you two and make you pay the price!” The furious shout of the girl rang out behind them. That had been transmitted through divine sense; otherwise, her voice could not possibly have caught up with Ling Han and his companion.

Ling Han ran for a while longer before he finally stopped. Gou Li also stopped, and panted as he said, “Brother, you are really a fast runner!”

“Brother?” Ling Han asked, smiling faintly.

Gou Li quickly waved his hand. “We have been thieves together and shared the spoils; what else can we be if not brothers? I say, Brother, don’t look so aggrieved. I very rarely acknowledge others. I have a high opinion of you!”

Ling Han chuckled, but did not make a move.

Though this Gou Li had screwed him over, he did not have a bad nature. That was because he had only parried and dodged under the girl’s attacks, just like him. If it had really been an extremely vicious person, he would definitely have fought back a long time ago.

Just for that, Ling Han believed that though this Gou Li was definitely the type to screw others over, he could not be considered a truly bad guy.
