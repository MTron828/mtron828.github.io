Chapter 1032: Treasure That Heavenly Body Tier Cultivators Fight For?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han needed to prepare for two scenarios.

What if they couldn’t find Pei Ji anymore?

This was an island, and there were only limited resources available. Only the Demonic Qi seemed to be limitless, appearing once every year. However, the other resources would definitely dwindle as they were used. There was simply no way that one could use the resources as they pleased.

Take, for example, the Godly metal that was used to strengthen puppets. Pei Ji had taken these from his master, and there was only a small amount remaining right now. If they took it away, Pei Ji would be missing a vital ingredient for puppet-making. No matter how talented he was, how could he make a puppet without the necessary materials?

Even if he carried some materials on him, he would only be able to make a limited amount of puppets. He would be dreaming if he wanted to recreate the large army of puppets that he’d once owned.

Some of the materials were extremely valuable, which made Ling Han extremely satisfied.

This was because puppet-making had some relation to forging, alchemy, formations, and so on and so forth. Thus, the materials that were used for puppet-making could also be used for other purposes. Ling Han sorted the materials and found that many could be sold once he returned to the capital. He was certainly going to rake in a huge amount of True Origin Stones.

Jin Zhihui and Fu Tian both received some materials as well, though the largest portion was obviously taken by Ling Han. The two of them had no issues with this, as Ling Han had indeed done the most. They were basically just passengers and onlookers.

Strictly speaking, they even owed their lives to Ling Han. Without him, it was very likely that they would be lying in eight pieces in some workshop right now, forced to watch as their bodies were refined into puppets.

They found a few ships, though they all were quite small. In fact, they were only a little bigger than boats. However, these ships were made from the unique Demonic Beasts of this sea, and they were even fitted with some strange device that allowed the ships to cut through the sea at high speed.

There were five such ships, so each of them was able to take one. The extra ship was stowed away by Ling Han.

It didn’t matter whether he needed it in the future or not. The space in the Black Tower was very large anyway, so he wasn’t afraid of it taking up too much room.

“Farewell, Brother Ling!”

“Till later!”

Jin Zhihui and Fu Tian both bade Ling Han farewell. They didn’t plan to return to the Tyrant Axe Harbor, either. Instead, they ventured into the sea, each going their own way.

Ling Han watched them disappear into the distance. Then, he turned around and smiled at Shui Yanyu, saying, “Wife, it’s only you and me left on this island. Should we make a bunch of kids before returning?”

Shui Yanyu punched his chest in annoyance, and said, “Do you think I’m a sow? Also, are we really the only two people on this island?”

She shot a glance at the Asura Demon Emperor.

The Asura Demon Emperor was given a fright, scared that master’s wife would suddenly slay him due to embarrassment. He immediately raised a leg and started to scratch his ear as any normal wolf would. It was as if his expression were saying that he wasn’t a person, merely a dog.

Shui Yanyu couldn’t help but giggle upon seeing his expression. She had already learned of his background, yet she was still unable to fathom how an elite at the Mountain River Tier could be so extremely shameless.

Ling Han chortled loudly, and sent the Asura Demon Emperor back into the Black Tower. He then pulled her over and started groping her slender and shapely body.

“Damn pervert! Stop it!” Shui Yanyu murmured. Her starry eyes were extremely seductive, and her hands rested on Ling Han’s chest, trying to push him away, yet also unwilling to do so.

“Stop what?” Ling Han kissed her jade-like neck and lightly nibbled her earlobe, causing her slender body to suddenly tighten up and her face to suddenly flush with an alluring shade of red.

‘This damn pervert has figured out all my weak points...’

Shui Yanyu was breathing heavily as she buried her head into Ling Han’s chest, and she said, “Pei Ji might still be on the island!”

Ling Han nodded in agreement. This was indeed a possibility as this island was very large, after all. They had also been few in numbers, so they had been unable to thoroughly search the entire island. Perhaps Pei Ji was waiting for Ling Han and the others to leave before he returned to his workshop.

Ling Han continued to grope Shui Yanyu’s body as he pondered this possibility. He had already developed a habit of doing this.

Shui Yanyu was slightly annoyed by this. ‘What kind of habit is this? Why does he have to grope my chest when pondering questions? In these past few days, this damn pervert has already groped my chest for longer than I have in my entire life!’

“We don’t have time to deal with that old thief. Let’s burn those courtyards down and be done with it.” Ling Han finally reached a decision, and said, “Let’s continue to look for pirates. Now that we have our own ship, we can come and go as we please.”

“Mm-hm!” Shui Yanyu nodded in agreement. They had killed quite a lot of pirates before, yet it had only been enough to complete a single mission. Since they had already come here, and since the mission could be completed numerous times, they might as well kill a few more pirates.

They immediately sprung into action, burning the entire village and then setting off from the beach.

“I wonder where that colossal pit leads to,” Ling Han said. “Moreover, it even spits out a wisp of Demonic Qi every once in a while. We definitely have to check it out in the future and see what lies at the bottom of the pit.”

Shui Yanyu was also extremely curious, and said, “We can’t fly before reaching the Heavenly Body Tier, so we can only come back after we break through.”

“I wonder if elites at the Heavenly Body Tier can fly over this expanse of sea,” Ling Han mused.

Shui Yanyu wasn’t sure, either, as the Shui Clan didn’t have any elites at the Heavenly Body Tier. As for the Heavenly Body Tier cultivators of other clans... who had the courage to ask them?

The ship was genuinely small, and it was completely unsuited for sailing over the sea, with a single wave being capable of capsizing the ship. However, this was no ordinary ship, but a ship that had been made by puppeteers. As such, there were all kinds of small trinkets on the ship that allowed it to remain extremely stable while still being extremely quick.

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were in no hurry, either, as they enjoyed some lovey-dovey time with each other. They were only 15 or so centimeters away from becoming a true pair of husband and wife.

“Hou Yang, how long are you going to flee?” A loud roar suddenly traveled over. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Heh, Ju Yueyun, do you think I’m afraid of you?” another voice replied.

“Then why are you running away?” the first voice asked.

“Then let’s battle! This lord is also pissed off by the insect following behind me!”

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu exchanged a surprised glance.

They raised their heads, only to see two people standing proudly as they faced off in the sky.

The ability to fly... They were great elites at the Heavenly Body Tier! No, no, no... It was more correct to say that they were at least at the Heavenly Body Tier.

Ling Han turned to Shui Yanyu, and asked, “Have you ever heard of these two people before?”

Shui Yanyu pondered for a moment, and an astonished expression suddenly appeared on her face. “Ju Yueyun... Could he be the Heavenly Body Tier elite from the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire? He’s a lone cultivator, and although he’s reached the Heavenly Body Tier, he’s never formed a force of his own.

“As for Hou Yang, I think he’s a great elite from the Jade Drop Majestic Empire. Why is he facing off against Ju Yueyun in this kind of place?”

Sure enough, these two people were both elites at the Heavenly Body Tier. Otherwise, huge changes would ensue if a great elite at the Eternal River Tier or Genesis Tier were to appear on the Joint Peace Planet.

“Judging by their previous exchange, it seems like they’ve already skirmished for quite a while,” Ling Han said. “At their cultivation, there are only two possibilities that could have led to this—the first is a grudge between them, and the second is because of a treasure!”

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu could see the astonishment in each other’s eyes as they exchanged a glance. A treasure that could trigger a fight between two elites at the Heavenly Body Tier was definitely incredibly valuable!
