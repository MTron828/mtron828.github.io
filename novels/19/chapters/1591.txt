Chapter 1592: Complete slaughter

The prison of flames began to close in.

All the Heaven Demons looked livid. They did not dare to actually touch these flames. Though the seals of great dao throbbing on them were badly damaged, their qualitative level overwhelmed the Genesis Tier an unknown number of times. They definitely could not be touched.

But the prison was closing in, and if they did not think of something, the flames would eventually burn them, and turn them into ashes.

“Kill this brat!”

“At least we have to force him into the Celestial Tool, and then the attack will vanish without being dispelled.”

“Attack will always be the best defense!”

The Heaven Demons all looked towards Ling Han, seething with killing intent.

Ling Han stood proudly, the two swords lowered at either side of him, exuding a frightening killing intent. “If you’re complaining about not dying fast enough, you can come over, and I will personally send you all on your way!”

“Savage!”

“You are just depending on a Celestial Tool.”

“If you had not had this good fortune, I would’ve been able to kill you over 100 times with a single thought!”

All the Heaven Demons were fuming mad, and began to attack Ling Han like mad.

Ling Han spun both swords in his hands, and held them in defense in front of him.

Just as Small Tower had said, his limit was fighting 10 peak stage Heaven Demons at the same time. Now, though the number of peak stage Heaven Demons had not reached as many as 10, there were still Heaven Demons at the early stage, middle stage, and late stage, and using their numbers to compensate, their battle prowess was still astonishing.

This was not something that he could stand against.

However, Ling Han did not step back.

He rapidly brandished the two swords to battle all the Heaven Demons, and the fiery prison was rapidly closing in as well. Once it completely closed in, all the Heaven Demons would be wiped out in one go. However, the opposite was also true. As long as the Heaven Demons managed to kill him, or force him into the Black Tower, the might of the Nine Heavens Flame would naturally also be removed.

Now that things had come to this, all the Heaven Demons were naturally putting their lives on the line, and burning their life force with no regard for the consequences. Their attacks blasted at Ling Han like mad. This was a situation in which either he would die or it would be they that would be dying.

The situation suddenly became incredibly desperate.

Everyone was watching dumbfounded. Who would have thought that a situation that was originally just a farce would suddenly develop to this extent?

The three big shots, Leng Xiaoran, Ouyang He, and Gou Hai, were all dumbstruck. They were in the lead of their peers, and were the first among them to become Demon Masters. Initially, they could claim to be the strongest prodigies, but now, compared with Ling Han, they were far from adequate.

In that short while just now, just how many Demon Masters had he killed?

More than 100!

And they weren’t Yellow Demons, but Black Demons, and even Earth Demons! Moreover, looking at the rate he was going, it seemed as if even Heaven Demons could be killed by his hand. He could slaughter 20-30 of them in one go, and this was definitely something that had never happened before in history, and was likely never going to happen again in future.

Now that he had reached this kind of height, as long as they did not want to battle to the death, even Heaven Demons would find it very difficult to leave a Yellow Demon alive, what more when it was a bunch of Heaven Demons.

However, an absolutely impossible feat had still happened.

The most frightening massacre in the cultivation world was about to play out, and this would affect the many future generations.

“Kill, kill, kill!” All the Heaven Demons had gone mad. The web of flames had already closed in for less than 30 meters, and in one or two breaths at most, they would be burned by the immortal flame, turning into ashes.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Powerful attacks blasted out like crazy, and it seemed as if the universe itself was about to explode. Over 20 Heaven Demons were fighting with their lives on the line at the same time, and they didn’t even care if they wounded their own allies. They only asked that they could show their full battle prowess.

Peng, peng, peng. Ling Han was repeatedly hit.

At present, though his cultivation level had temporarily reached the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, the strength of his physique had not caught up with that level. How could he possibly sustain so many desperate attacks from so many Heaven Demons?

His Godly bones were shattered, and he instantly became a figure of blood, making for an extremely tragic scene.

“Haha, he’s definitely about to die!”

“He actually did not dodge, and deluded himself into thinking that he can slaughter us!”

“When we achieved Dao, even your ancestors were nowhere to be found, what wishful thinking!”

“We will send you on your way!”

All the Demon Masters were elated, and hurriedly picked up the pace in their attacks, wanting to kill Ling Han. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The circumstances changed rapidly in a single instant, and it was a feast for everyone ‘s eyes. Just now, it seemed as if it was Ling Han who would be slaughtering all the Heaven Demons, and make his own mark in history, but in the blink of an eye, it was now he that was at the end of his line.

In the end... what would the conclusion be?

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Attacks fell like rain, illuminating the whole galaxy, causing this initially dark corner to become incredibly bright as if there were a few dozen suns exploding in this place.

Though Ling Han tried his best to parry the attacks, and even killed a few Heaven Demons, he couldn’t hold up to the fact that there were really too many Heaven Demons. One attack from each of them was enough to drown him in the barrage of attacks.

He was throwing up blood like mad, his body completely misshapen. After a frightening sword light swept over him, his head was removed, and exploded with a bang. Even his spirit had been erased.

“We killed him!” WHen the Demon Masters saw this, they were instantly overjoyed. With their abilities, they naturally could tell whether someone had died or was still alive.

“Unfortunately, his spirit has directly exploded, and we were not able to obtain his memories through plucking out his soul.”

“The Celestial King technique!”

They all cried out. After sacrificing so much, in the end, they still didn’t manage to obtain the Celestial King technique; how could they accept that?

“No!” the Heaven Demon from the Leng Clan suddenly exclaimed in shock. “Why has this prison of flames not vanished?”

Going by reason, with Ling Han’s death, his technique naturally would completely disappear as well.

“T-this brat is not dead yet!” All the Heaven Demons’ faces turned pale. He was not dead even when his spirit had been shattered?

Boom!

A flame waved, exuding a frighteningly high temperature. It seemed capable of melting even Divine Metal. This might was not inferior in the slightest to the Nine Heavens Flame, and among the flames, a human figure was presently rapidly forming from nothing.

The flames waved, and a young man walked out. There were still flames burning on his body, yet they did not wound him at all.

It was none other than Ling Han!

Rising From The Ashes, one of his strongest trump cards,

“Impossible!” Now, even the Heaven Demons could not accept this. A person whose form and spirit had both been destroyed actually came back to life; was there any justice left in this world?

Yet, they no longer had the time to be surprised. The web of flames had completely closed in.

“Ah!” Even if they were Heaven Demons, so what? Having the Nine Heavens Flame burn their bodies, they immediately erupted in cries of agony. This was an immortal flame, and the slightest touch could burn both the form and spirit.

Boom!

The immortal flame was merciless, and treated all the Heaven Demons like fuel, burning them to nothing. Some Heaven Demons gritted their teeth, and cast off their physical bodies, but it was no use. The immortal flame soared to the skies, and embroiled even their spirits.

More than 20 Heaven Demons did not struggle for very long, and were very quickly burned into dust, completely vanishing in this heaven and earth.

The heaven and earth shared the grief, which led to a rain of blood.

Ling Han stood eminently. That image of his black locks dancing in the breeze, both hands wielding swords was forever imprinted into everyone’s hearts.

He had killed over 100 Demon Masters in a single battle, and furthermore, there were even more than 20 Heaven Demons among them, creating an unprecedented feat in the recorded history of the Netherworld.

There had never been anyone that could be strong to this extent!

Ling Han’s eyes swept over the surroundings, and there was no one that dared make eye contact with him. They all lowered their heads. It was unknown who was the first, but everyone knelt down on a single knee, as if they were worshipping a god of war.

Ling Han did not commit any more bloodshed. Those that remained were more or less ants to him. If they sought him out for vengeance in future, he would deal with them then.
