Chapter 1311 Battling Chi Huangji

Boom!

The earth tremored uncontrollably as the fist smashed down, with at least one-third of the forest being obliterated. The earth was like an upturned carpet, continuing to undulate as shock waves traveled through it. It only came to a rest after a few dozen seconds. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was utterly terrifying. The might of a single fist was actually this powerful!

One had to realize that this was an area that had been formed by the clash of Regulations of the two realms. In other words, it should have been indestructible.

The Stone Emperor retracted his fist.

Pa!

His mountain-like fist instantly shrunk back to normal size. There was a look of haughty pride on his face. His devastating fist was capable of defeating most elites at the peak stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, so how could a Mountain River Tier cultivator withstand it?

With his mountain-like fist now out of the way, the scene of carnage was finally laid bare for all to see.

Ling Han... was still standing!

Gasp!

Not only was the Stone Emperor shocked, but the others were all equally shocked as well. Ling Han had faced such a formidable strike head-on, yet he was still standing there as if nothing had ever happened?

In reality, one would need to unleash power above the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier if they genuinely wanted to obliterate Level Five Godly metal with brute strength. If one wanted to do so with power at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, they would need to utilize the power of Regulations as well. For example, they would have to unleash Regulations of flames or Regulations of poison.

In any case, Ling Han practiced the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so both his defense and recovery ability were far above his battle prowess.

If there were two Ling Hans in the world, a battle between them would definitely end with neither of them being able to kill each other.

Ling Han stretched his muscles. His clothes had been completely destroyed, yet he had already put on a new change of clothes. He smiled, and said, “That punch was fairly impressive. Even my bones were almost broken.”

If the power of the Stone Emperor’s strike had been a little stronger and reached the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, it would have indeed been capable of breaking Ling Han’s Godly bones.

At this moment, however, even the proud Stone Emperor was incredulous with shock. He had no choice but to yield, and said, “I’m no match for you if we battle at the same cultivation level.”

In terms of defense, Ling Han was even more powerful than him, a Rock Spirit. In terms of offense, Ling Han could unleash heaven’s might and decrease his opponent’s battle prowess by two stars. Thus, in a battle at the same cultivation level, even supreme king tiers could only grudgingly admit defeat.

Both his offensive and defensive abilities were incredible, so how could one possibly defeat him?

If one wanted to defeat Ling Han, they would have to possess an advantage in cultivation level.

“You’re such a freak!” the Stone Emperor remarked.

Such a remark should have been spoken by others to describe him. Yet, at this moment, this remark was used by him to describe someone else. From this, it could be seen just how astonished he was.

Ling Han laughed heartily, and said, “Now that you’ve lost, it’s time to hand me a vial of spiritual liquid!”

The Stone Emperor felt extremely gloomy. However, he didn’t break his promise, and he made a small cut on his arm, filling a small vial with his spiritual liquid. He was a Heavenly Body Tier elite on top of being a Rock Spirit, so his blood was definitely a precious treasure, even among the Heavenly Body Tier.

He tossed the vial to Ling Han, who gladly placed it in the Black Tower.

Meanwhile, Chi Huangji and the North Emperor were still locked in a fierce battle, both of them unleashing their ultimate trump cards.

The North Emperor wielded a saber, and it was as if even heaven and earth would be sliced open as he swung his golden saber through the air. Opposite him, Chi Huangji wielded an ancient mirror that relentlessly fired bursts of scorching flames that seemed as if they could incinerate all matter.

Their battle prowess was genuinely on par, and, at this moment, they were competing with their God Tools.

The North Emperor was the disciple of a Saint, and although his saber wasn’t forged from Saintly Material, it was forged from Level 15 Godly metal. This was material that even Eternal River Tier elites would salivate over. A weapon forged from such a valuable material was naturally very powerful.

However, it was extremely likely that Chi Huangji’s ancient mirror was a genuine Saint Tool. Its might was profound.

Right now, both of their God Tools had been suppressed to the Mountain River Tier, so it was naturally the Saint Tool that enjoyed an edge—although only a very slight edge.

With this slight edge, Chi Huangji was finally able to assert his dominance, which became more and more evident as time went on.

The North Emperor clearly wasn’t an unreasonably stubborn person. He quickly retreated with a shake of his head, and said, “I’ve lost.” Although he had only lost because he possessed a weaker God Tool, a loss was a loss. There was no need to make any excuses.

In a rare sight, Chi Huangji finally became serious for a moment, saying, “You’re very strong. However, if we battle at our true cultivation levels, I’ll achieve victory with even more ease!” If they battled at their true cultivation levels, the advantage of his Saint Tool over the North Emperor’s Level 15 God Tool would naturally be even more overwhelming.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. By the looks of it, Yang Lin wasn’t the only person blessed by the fortune of heaven and earth. Chi Huangji also possessed a Saint Tool.

“Next...” Chi Huangji turned to look at Ling Han. A menacing look appeared on his face, and he said, “After defeating you, I’ll become the true king among kings!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “The scope of your vision is truly limited. To say nothing of which of us will win, what we can see is only a tiny fraction of the vast and boundless universe. Heaven knows if there are other more powerful prodigies out there.”

Indeed, he knew about the Celestial Realm, and Hu Niu had reached the Genesis Tier after a mere five years of cultivation. So, at the mention of king among kings... heh.

“Come, fight me!” Chi Huangji stepped forward, and roared, “Three lifetimes akin to destruction, seven slashes of the divine sense!”

Weng!

A ferocious glint burst from his eyes, transforming into a Divine Sword that slashed at Ling Han.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. This was actually a divine sense attack!

He had come across many people who had cultivated their divine senses, rendering his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique almost ineffective. However, very few people practiced divine sense attacks. This was why he was so astonished upon seeing Chi Huangji’s attack.

The Divine Sword arrived before Ling Han.

Ling Han stood solemnly, not moving to block or catch the strike. He allowed the Divine Sword to continue toward the top of his head.

Chi Huangji sneered coldly. He had put a huge amount of effort into cultivating his divine sense, so it was not only incredibly sturdy but also possessed a devastating might when unleashed as an attack.

Yet, this person actually dared to treat it so carelessly? He was truly asking for trouble!

He had never imagined that this battle would be so effortless and easy to win.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and asked, “That’s all?”

He practiced the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and thus his divine sense was a level above his cultivation level. As such, it would be incredibly difficult to wound his divine sense.

Chi Huangji’s expression finally became serious. To block his divine sense attack was no amazing feat. However, Ling Han had faced his attack head-on and come out of it completely unscathed! This was quite terrifying.

‘This person’s divine sense is perhaps even stronger than mine.’

Chi Huangji laughed loudly, and said, “Impressive. This is the decisive battle that I yearn!” His seriousness transformed into a soaring fighting spirit, and he formed a series of hand seals as he said, “Eat my Eight Phrase True Technique!

“Birth, old age, sickness, and death, myriad diseases upon your body!”

Weng!

Several bursts of black light shot out from Chi Huangji’s mouth, transforming into eight eerie black symbols that crashed toward Ling Han.

Ling Han instantly sensed a terrifying killing intent bearing down upon him. His entire body trembled in apprehension.

This was a harrowing secret technique, one that put pressure on even him.

He discovered that his vitality had been weakened significantly, with his mind and spirit both hitting a trough.

‘Huh? Is this a curse?’

Ling Han had obtained the Vial of Curses before, and he could curse anyone to death as long as he obtained their blood, hair, or other bodily substances. Even if one was extremely resilient and didn’t die from his curses, they would still suffer a terrible bout of illness and suffer severe wounds to their Origin Power.

That vial had been owned by a bunch of people who had practiced Netherworld cultivation techniques. Following this logic, it was probably safe to say that the art of curses was a cultivation technique of the Netherworld.

He gave a soft roar as he unleashed the might of lightning. Bursts of crackling white lightning instantly enveloped him, cleansing him of the effects of Chi Huangji’s curses.

The power of heavenly tribulation could cleanse and purify all matter.

Chi Huangji cracked a smile, and said, “Interesting.”
