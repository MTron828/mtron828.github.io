Chapter 2127: Besieged

“What do you mean?” Ling Han asked.

“The Imperial Void Celestial King is no ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial King. His strength is unfathomable, and is just a thread’s breadth away from Heavenly Venerable Tier,” Small Tower said solemnly. “If he was given a few more epochs, he may really be able to break the great limits of heaven and earth, and successfully attain Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“If he gets curious about you, there is no way you would be able to keep any secrets.”

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “It’s fine. It’s just an idea in my head for now. It’s not like I am so determined to go. However, could it be that there is no way that I could fool the eyes of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, or even a Heavenly Venerate?”

If the one he was talking to was not Small Tower, it would be absolutely impossible for Ling Han to voice out such a question.

To fool the eyes of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, or even a Heavenly Venerate? Was he joking?

However, Small Tower was a Heavenly Venerable Tier Tool, so perhaps there was indeed some way possible.

Small Tower paused, and after a while, it finally said, “There is a secret technique in the Heavenly Saint Palace that can fool the heavens and earth, and coordinating with your power of the Five Elements Source Powers, it should be possible for you to temporarily deceive a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. However, if the Imperial Void Celestial King observes you carefully, don’t even think of hiding anything.”

“Don’t you even think about Heavenly Venerable Tier. This has surpassed the Regulations of heaven and earth, and has touched directly on essence.”

Ling Han nodded. Apparently, he really needed to make a trip to the Heavenly Saint Palace, and he could just see his son while he was at it. Who knew if this silly brat was still being imprisoned.

He set out towards the Roc Heaven, his speed becoming faster and faster.

Too many, too many years had passed. He longed to see his parents and lovers again. Such thoughts became increasingly urgent and pressing.

Now that he had grasped the powerful Regulations of Space, he used the Void Space, and pushed his speed to the pinnacle.

Two months later, he entered the Roc Heaven.

It could not be helped. Even if his present speed had reached the pinnacle, that was still only the pinnacle of the Dividing Soul Tier. Any Immortal Palace Tier would be able to easily crush him. It was only two months, and this was already very, very fast.

After entering the Roc Heaven, he would occasionally see manifestations of Qi forming multiple images of the Roc in the air. However, he quickly saw arrows shoot from the ground and destroy these manifestations.

At first, Ling Han thought this was only a random phenomenon, but after several times of the same thing happening, Ling Han finally realized that something was off.

Xiu, another sharp arrow shot out, and shattered the Qi of the Roc. Ling Han immediately flew, descending down towards where the sharp arrow had shot out from.

His figure descended, and saw that a middle-aged man was just presently withdrawing the giant bow he was holding. It was dark green in color, and even taller than the archer.

“Brat, what are you looking at?” This middle-aged man tossed a glare at him, multiple great stars appearing in his pupils, and exuding a frightening aura.

This was an Immortal Palace Tier great elite.

Ling Han clasped his fists together in greeting, and said, “This junior just happened to pass by, and coincidentally saw Senior use your powerful technique. The arrow furiously shot through the skies, possessing boundless dominance. I have thus deliberately come over, wishing to admire Senior’s graceful bearing.”

He could speak in a very caustic manner, causing others to stomp in fury, but at the same time, he could also speak in a way that made others feel very pleased and comfortable.

This middle-aged man was very pleased by this compliment, and couldn’t help but laugh loudly as he said, “That’s right. I am renowned as the ‘Ultimate Shot’. One man and one arrow, and I can stop thousands of soldiers and horses in their tracks.”

He had been dispatched to stand guard here. It was actually quite boring, and he just happened to encounter someone who “admired” him. Thus, even if this was only a junior, he could still help him pass some time.

“Is Senior here to hunt Immortal Beasts?” Ling Han feigned ignorance.

“Hehe, you don’t understand.” The middle-aged man shook his head. “What I shot down earlier is called Roc Qi. According to legend, when the heaven and earth first split, the Source Beast, the Roc, was born here. Thus, even if the Roc has long since died, there would still be Roc Qi gushing out here.”

“What is the use of it?” Ling Han still pretended to be very foolish and naive.

The middle-aged man wanted to say something, but then hesitated. He glanced at Ling Han, and then clapped his head, saying, “If you were a woman, I would have suspected your motives. However, the Roc Palace does not accept male disciples, so you must have no relation with the Roc Palace.

“There is no harm telling you. Our Four Seas Palace is presently besieging the Roc Palace, and destroying these Roc Qi is my mission. That can sever the source of power for the Roc Palace, and can also sever their fortune as well.”

The Roc Palace was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. The fact that the middle-aged man could personally come and participate in the battle to obliterate the Roc Palace would become something that he could be proud of in the future, and he would be able to boast about it for the rest of his life.

The Roc Palace’s circumstances had already deteriorated to this extent?

Their enemies were already here destroying Roc Qi without the slightest reservations, which was equivalent to leaping on their heads, but the Roc Palace could not do anything about it. The circumstances were really extremely horrible.

Ling Han continued trying to worm information out from the middle-aged man, and the latter was, firstly, bored, and secondly, did not suspect any ulterior motives, and thought that since Ling Han was a man, he had to be unrelated to the Roc Palace. As long as it was nothing that touched on the top secrets of the Roc Palace, he just talked to his heart’s content.

However, even if he wanted to leak out those secrets, it would be impossible. Immortal Palace Tiers could be considered elite in a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, but it was absolutely impossible for them to be involved in any top-secret matters. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After chatting for a long time, Ling Han wanted to leave, but the middle-aged man still persistently held on to him, and talked about his past glories. His interest in talking was very high, and he talked for over two days. Only then was the middle-aged man finally willing to let Ling Han leave.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. He had actually encountered a chatterbox.

The Roc Palace was naturally highly renowned in the Roc Heaven. Ling Han only had to make some casual enquiries, and easily found out the way to the Roc Palace. After about a month, he finally arrived at the foot of the mountain beneath the Roc Palace.

On his way here, he had also seen a great many people who were shattering Roc Qi like the middle-aged man, showing that the Roc Palace’s present situation was really one of great peril.

Ling Han did not directly ascend the mountain, because he couldn’t. There was presently an army that was unleashing a fierce offensive at the mountain entrance.

He was initially stunned, but then relaxed because these troops were not powerful. The strongest among them was only at the Ascending Origin Tier.

Was an Ascending Origin Tier not strong enough?

In other forces, an Ascending Origin Tier was indeed strong, and overwhelmingly strong at that. However, both the Four Seas Palace and Roc Palace were Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces. Celestial Kings numbered in the hundreds, and Ascending Origin Tier really could not be considered all that powerful.

Thus, this was only a clash of Ascending Origin Tier against Ascending Origin Tier, which meant that this was just a small-scale skirmish, and neither side had gotten really serious yet.

True enough, this battle only lasted three days before ending, and both sides withdrew their own troops.

Ling Han still could not pass, because the Four Seas Palace had sealed off the path of entry into the Roc Palace. Neither exit nor entry was possible.

Previously, hearing the situation that Hu Niu had described, the circumstances had not been as grim as this. Though the Four Seas Palace had penetrated into the Roc Heaven, it had not reached the extent that their swords were aimed directly at their main doors, but now it looked like they were close to eliminating the Roc Palace in a single move.

What to do now?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and came up with an idea.

…When the Four Seas Palace launched an offensive the next time, he would pretend to be a soldier on the side of the Four Seas Palace and sneak in. After he had rushed out of the area the Four Seas Palace had sealed off, he would then reveal his true identity, and then he would be able to enter into the Roc Palace.

But in that way, if he wanted to leave, his path would be paved with great difficulty.

He had already exposed his face. If he wanted to come back out again, would the Four Seas Palace easily let him pass?

Who cared? He would just enter first, and then think about other things later.

He waited patiently, and a mere seven days later, the Four Seas Palace once again released a new wave of attacks.

“Charge!” Ling Han called out loudly, mingling with the troops of the Four Seas Palace. In any case, he was a man, so there would definitely be no one who would suspect that he was on the side of the Roc Palace.
