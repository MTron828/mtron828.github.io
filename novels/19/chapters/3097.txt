3098 Big Win

In the Genesis World, everyone with a ball of light in their minds had their own unique traits.

For example, Ling Han’s natural talent in alchemy was extraordinary, Ning Haixin had an extremely strong affinity, and Wang Quanhe was extremely lucky. And after Ling Han obtained the power of the entire Genesis World and the entire Void, all of these attributes were also obtained by him.

The Genesis World and the Void were both contained within the Divine Stone, and since it was called a Divine Stone, it definitely wouldn’t just give birth to Ling Han, right?

Thus, Ling Han guessed that these abilities of his should be usable.

Of course, he couldn’t guarantee it, so he had to give it a try.

“2,000.” He pushed out another chip.

In the end, he got five points, while the beauty only got three points.

The gambling continued. No matter how good or bad Ling Han’s luck was, he would always have one or two points more than his opponent.

Finally, the beautiful woman threw out two sixes, and the dealer took all. However, Ling Han had suddenly lowered the stakes, causing her to feel even more depressed after winning than if she had lost.

After completely proving that he possessed the luck attribute, Ling Han began to bet his golden chips.

Soon, the beautiful woman lost so badly that her hands trembled.

Jade seeds were priceless. One jade seed was enough to buy her. And now, she had already lost over 100 jade seeds. How could she not break out in a cold sweat?

“Mengmeng, take a rest first. I’ll do it.” Sister Yang appeared. She had a smile on her pretty face, but there was killing intent in her eyes.

Alright, this Zheng Tongfeng actually dared to lie to her!

How was this an innocent boy? He was simply pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger. His gambling skills were too brilliant.

Ling Han had only lost small amounts of money, but he had won big bets. If one were to say that he was not an elite gambler, who would believe it?

Zheng Tongfeng also followed her in. He looked at the pile of chips in front of Ling Han with a face full of surprise, and instantly felt a million curses run through his heart.

‘F*ck, what’s going on?’

The staff of the casino were all professionals. How could they not be able to play better than a young man?

Ling Han nodded, and smiled. “Sure.”

Actually, he didn’t have any gambling skills, and relied entirely on luck. The key was that his luck was so good that he could just ignore everyone else. It wouldn’t make a difference whoever the dealer was.

“How about we change the gambling method?” Sister Yang smiled.

“Sure.” Ling Han didn’t mind.

They switched to playing pai jiu[1]. After a brief introduction of the rules, the game began.

A moment later, cold sweat broke out on Sister Yang’s fair forehead.

At first glance, they had gambled 10 rounds, and both sides had won five rounds each. However, Ling Han had only lost a small amount of money, and every round he won was a huge profit. Thus, even though the number of wins and losses was clearly the same, he had still won a few hundred jade seeds.

Sister Yang could not hold on any longer. She knew that she had met a true elite.

Absolutely. She didn’t even know how she lost. She could only attribute it to luck.

Luck was indistinct. Could it be taken seriously?

Thus, it could only be said that Ling Han’s gambling skills were so superb that she could not even tell how he had won.

“I’m a little tired,” she said. “Young Master Ling is really good at gambling. Why don’t we call it a day? The sun is about to rise. I also want to have a good rest. For women, staying up too late is too harmful to the body.”

Ling Han didn’t say anything in objection. If he continued to gamble, the entire casino might be lost to him. If that happened, whether or not he could walk out of here alive would be a problem.

After all, he was too weak now.

He nodded, put away his chips, and left. When he passed by Zheng Tongfeng, he smiled, and said, “Thank you, Senior Brother Zheng.” Then, he left.

As expected!

Sister Yang looked at Zheng Tongfeng, her gaze sharp and filled with killing intent.

How much did the casino lose that night?

Nearly 700 jade seeds, this was an astonishing amount of wealth!

And all of this was caused by Zheng Tongfeng. He actually said that Ling Han was a fat sheep that had come to deliver money.

Gift your head!

‘Zheng Tongfeng, this matter won’t be settled so easily.’

Zheng Tongfeng, on the other hand, was about to cry. How could he have thought that a person who had popped out of a rock not only knew how to gamble, but was also so proficient in gambling that he defeated the casino?

He was not afraid of Sister Yang. Although he was a little weak, he was still a disciple of the Ancient Dao Sect. The other party would not dare to be rough. However, the problem was that the real owner of this casino was Gu Tang!

Who was Gu Tang? The third elder of the Ancient Dao Sect!

If Zheng Tongfeng offended Gu Tang, he wouldn’t even know how he would die.

He didn’t know how he walked out, but when he sat down on the street, he was drenched in a cold sweat.

Go, go back and ask Li Changdan for help. This was his idea. Now that something had happened, he naturally couldn’t ignore it. Yes, go back quickly and ask Li Changdan to mediate the issue.

***

While Zheng Tongfeng was hurriedly looking for Li Changdan to be a mediator, Ling Han had already redeemed his chips, and returned to the Ancient Dao Sect.

This was the first time he had seen a jade seed. It was only the size of a soybean, and looked like a beautiful piece of jade that had been smashed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

One jade seed was naturally very small, but 700 of them added together were still quite heavy.

Ling Han asked the casino for a cloth bag. As if he was doing manual labor, he only managed to move it back after some effort.

His power… was truly too weak.

Ling Han only rested for a moment, and the sun had already come out.

He hurriedly went to practice his fist technique. His first meridian was once again greatly unblocked. According to Sun Jianfang, two people might have both opened up their meridians, but there was still the term “width.”

In numerical terms, if a person’s meridian width was 1, and the other was 100, it would also be filled with power. How big would the difference between the two be?

This was the foundation.

Ling Han naturally had to open his meridian to the extreme, and only then would he open the second one. Otherwise, rashly coveting progress would only make him regret it in the future.

Half an hour later, Ling Han stopped. The time to cultivate had already passed, so there was no point in cultivating any further.

This time, some impurities were expelled from his body, but compared to a few days ago, it was much less.

This meant that his physique had improved quite a bit, so it wouldn’t be as violent anymore.

‘I really have to thank Zheng Tongfeng. When I was lacking money, he sent it to me.’ Ling Han smiled. When his strength increased, he would definitely “thank” Zheng Tongfeng properly.

‘Now, I can construct the Three Elements Formation and refine the Meridian Guiding Pill.’

Money, his biggest problem, had already been solved, so Ling Han decided to make some better formation foundations. He didn’t want to treat refining Meridian Guiding Pills as a one-shot deal.

The best material for the formation foundations was Earth Element Iron, which was currently the strongest material known. It had excellent toughness, and was resistant to heat and cold.

This material was very expensive. It had been used on battleships in the past, but now it was used to forge cold weapons. In the hands of cultivators, this material could unleash incomparably terrifying power.

Ling Han went to the small town to purchase it. The Three Elements Formation was very simple, and only required three formation foundations. Thus, he needed very little Earth Element Iron.

He had bought this material from a weapon shop. An amount that was just the size of his fist alone cost him 30 jade seeds.

It was very expensive.
