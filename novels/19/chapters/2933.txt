2934 Breaking through to Fourth Tier

‘It would be best to keep this kind of wealth-delivering boy alive.’ Ling Han nodded. Killing Feng Wuding would not be enough to vent his hatred. His target was Yue Borong. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

‘Then let’s decide on this happily.’

Ling Han found another safe place, and began to consume Great Herbs.

10 days passed, and he had also digested 10 Great Herbs, but he was still a sliver away from the peak stage of the Third Tier.

“Fortunately, the wealth-sending boy is generous enough. There are still four Great Herbs left,” Ling Han mumbled to himself, and began chewing on Great Herbs again.

One wasn’t enough, and two were also a bit lacking. It was only right when he devoured the third Great Herb that Ling Han finally reached the peak stage of the Third Tier.

‘I should spend some time tempering my foundations. However, there are endless Powers of Dimension in my body, which is equivalent to a millstone that has already tempered my power to an incredibly pure level. Moreover, I don’t have any more time.

‘I will immediately begin breaking through to the Fourth Tier!’

Ling Han channeled all the Heavenly Venerable Seals. In the first place, this was a means to communicate with fundamental particles. With more than 200 seals channeling at the same time, his spirit expanded endlessly to sense the third fundamental power of the heaven and earth.

Previously, he had spent several hundred million years to achieve this, but now he could not afford that much time.

‘I have to sense the third fundamental particle as quickly as possible.’

Ling Han took out that orange-colored Great Herb, thought for a while, and then immediately began to chew on it.

He believed that he would be able to break through to the Fourth Tier without relying on this kind of Great Herb, but this could possibly take one to two billion years. He did not have that much time to waste now.

Weren’t Great Herbs saved up for the purpose of consumption?

In just a few bites, this Great Herb had completely entered Ling Han’s stomach. Not long after, a great many particles appeared in his mind, as many as the stars in the sky.

Although there were countless of them, they could still be categorized. There were a total of six types, and the two types of power in Ling Han’s body immediately resonated with two types of starlight particles, causing the light emitted by these particles to become even more dazzling.

These were the fundamental particles, Ling Han thought. No wonder the orange-colored Great Herb could help Heavenly Venerates advance their cultivation level. This was equivalent to materializing the fundamental particles.

However, the moment his divine sense touched them, those starlight particles immediately dimmed and rapidly disappeared.

Ling Han tensed. Even if he had ingested a Great Herb, it did not mean that he would definitely be able to break through. It could only offer him some help.

He calmed down, and no longer touched them blindly. Instead, he only targeted one particular type.

The fundamental particles repelled each other. If he was greedy, and wanted to master all the fundamental particles in one go, the result would only be that he would not be able to get anything.

He targeted a single type of particle, and continued to touch it, increasing his sensitivity to this kind of particle.

The effects of the Great Herb were very short-term, and after merely half a day, his mind dimmed, and he could no longer sense the slightest bit of it.

Ling Han did not feel the slightest bit of regret. He once again released his divine sense, which enshrouded his surroundings.

The mark of the third fundamental particle had already been left in his mind. Now, he only had to communicate with the actual fundamental particle through this mark.

Time slowly crept by. 10 days, 100 days over 7000 years later, Ling Han’s divine sense suddenly trembled. Joy instantly spread across his face.

He had finally communicated with the third fundamental particle.

‘Come!’

Over 200 Heavenly Venerable Seals lit up at the same time, continuously absorbing such particles into his body, increasing Ling Han’s power.

This was the Mesotron Particle.

Ling Han suppressed the need for energy in the Powers of Dimension in his body, and focused on extracting these particles to increase his power, temper his physique, and stabilize his cultivation level. Everything else could be done slowly; he could not rush things.

100,000 years was too short.

In the Void, three figures were presently rapidly flying past. Upon a closer look, each of them was strange-looking. They were either multiarmed, multi-legged, multiheaded or multi-eyed.

These were Hysteria’s creations.

These three monsters all exuded a violent aura. They were incredibly strong, but their eyes were filled with the brilliance of intelligence. They were definitely not something that those monsters that only knew slaughter could compare to.

They arrived at the Genesis World of the last era. They descended, and as their eyes swept over the surroundings, a change took place in their bodies. They became human, and their aura similarly changed. They became no different from normal humans.

They walked slowly, searching for clues.

These were three Sixth-Tier monsters, and their mission was very simple, and that was to kill two people.

One of them was Ling Han, while the other was Feng Wuding.

After spending another 30,000 years, Ling Han had finally stabilized his cultivation as a Fourth Tier.

“I still have a lot of room for improvement,” he said to himself. The maximum number of dimensions that he could develop in his body had suddenly increased to as many as 137. Furthermore, the upper limit in quality of these dimensions was also close to a high-level dimension now.

Additionally, the Powers of Dimension could also be improved now.

However, the time needed for this would be much, much too long. Even if he was given a billion years, that would probably be just barely enough time.

Right now, he couldn’t care less. His priority was mine exploration and unearthing raw stones.

After his cultivation level had increased, Ling Han’s luck suddenly seemed to have improved. Not many days later, he discovered a spatial passageway.

He was already fearless now. Even if he encountered Xin Qihu again, he was confident that he could put up a fight now.

After entering the passageway, space overlapped and changed. After half a day, Ling Han finally entered the ruins of another dimension.

He was definitely not the first person to come here, but this was not one of the first 10 dimensions, because the traces of veins of ore being mined were still very new.

Boom! An energy storm surged out violently 30 meters in front of Ling Han.

Ling Han’s heroic spirit soared, and he threw a punch at the energy storm.

Peng! The power of the punch surged, and a hole was actually punched open in the energy storm. This hole did not close up even after a long time had passed.

Only after the force of Ling Han’s punch completely dissipated did the hole in the energy storm begin to close, and rapidly disappeared.

...

“My battle prowess should barely be on the level of the Sixth Tier.” Ling Han had gained a more direct understanding. “I can only be ranked among the weakest Sixth Tiers.”

It couldn’t be helped. He hadn’t cultivated to the pinnacle of this cultivation level, so he could only be regarded as a weak Sixth Tier with battle prowess like this.

However, no matter how weak he was, he was still a Sixth Tier elite. He was still overwhelmingly impressive.

“If I advance another step further, I will be able to possess the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier elite!” Ling Han’s eyes lit up. If he reached the Seventh Tier, he would no longer need to worry about the energy storm here or the super flames formed by the fundamental particles, and could mine the treasures from the Genesis World of the last era completely.

At that time, his cultivation level would definitely soar, allowing him to charge into the Seventh Tier even in terms of cultivation level. Then, his battle prowess would reach an unimaginable level of strength.

“I wonder where that Bai Mifan went?” Ling Han mumbled to himself. “Forget it, I’ll just harvest some Great Herbs first and give that brat a portion as compensation.”

He began to explore the mines. Though he had come here very late, with his incomparable ability of exploration and mining, he had already harvested another 20-odd Great Herbs and three Heavenly Venerable Seals in a mere century.

“Hmm?”

He had just found a new vein of ore, and had not yet begun to explore it, but then he looked like he was listening attentively. There was the sound of battle.

Fighting here was naturally a very normal thing. At first, Ling Han did not take it to heart, but as the shock waves from the battle became more and more intense, he managed to sense a familiar aura.

Bai Mifan.

...

He was fighting with someone?

Ling Han immediately dashed toward the location of the battle. His lackey was in trouble, so how could he stand by and watch as the boss?

It was only a matter of a few steps, and he was already close to the area where the battle was taking place. He saw that Bai Mifan was indeed fighting fiercely with someone, and his opponent was shockingly Feng Wuding.
