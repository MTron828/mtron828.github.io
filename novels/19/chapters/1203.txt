Chapter 1204: Day of the Auction

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There were still 47 days until the auction.

Obviously, the Gao Faction would definitely not allow the auction to proceed, because once the Thousand Source True Fluid had been auctioned off, the buyer would either be an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier or a force that had the backing of one. No ordinary person would have that kind of wealth.

And in the face of elites of the Heavenly Body Tier, the Gao Faction would firstly be too embarrassed to try to snatch the treasure, and secondly, they might not be successful either... unless Venerable Trinity moved personally. But if Venerable Trinity had been willing to move, there wouldn’t have been an auction in the first place.

Hence, the Gao Faction would definitely have to rush against time to deal with Ling Han before the auction started. In that case, the Thousand Source True Fluid would be theirs.

As for how the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid were to be divided, and how Ling Han would be finally dealt with, that was their internal business. In short, they had to first snatch the Thousand Source True Fluid.

“These few days, I have already discovered that there are people keeping a surveillance in secret!”

“Looks like the Gao Faction is finally going to make a true killing move!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“No need for a few days, and the sect would put me on trial. Though this seems like farce to me, this is a world where only the strong rule in the first place. Now that the Hua Faction has shrunk back, unless Venerable Trinity spoke up, this battle would not be easily fought!”

Ling Han was pondering deeply. Even he had not foreseen that things would have progressed to this level. At the time, he had only given his full effort in battle just for the sake of safeguarding his own treasure. He had not predicted that this would have given the Gao Faction an opening to raise difficult questions and place the deaths of Shi Ming and the others on his account as well.

Though this matter was indeed slightly related to him, it had been the Gao Faction provoking him in the first place. It couldn’t possibly be that since you were about to rob me, I would have to smilingly surrender my treasure, right?

Then what was the point of cultivation? He might as well just become a coward.

“Though that’s the fact, how should I actually survive this ordeal?”

Ling Han considered for a very long time, and finally came to a decision.

“No matter if it is the Gao Faction or the Hua Faction, what they want is the Thousand Source True Fluid. Then, from this day onwards, I will stay in the Black Tower and not come out. I will drag it out all the way until the day of the auction, when I will rid myself of the Thousand Source True Fluid.

“Then, the pressure I face would be considerably smaller. Perhaps only Gao Huang would be biting at me at that time like a mad dog.

“Hoho, Gao Huang, Gao Huang, though we have never met, you should be very honored to become the first person that I want to kill before even meeting him!”

Ling Han smirked coldly. He was forced so far that he could only stay in the Black Tower for his own safety. Naturally, he was furious.

After sending Fan Ru off to Hu Feiyun’s, Ling Han informed Ding Ping, Feng Po Yun, Shui Yanyu, and the others, telling them not to come and look for him these few days. Then, he entered into the Black Tower, and continued to cultivate the Star Plucking Step.

However, two days later, the Gao Faction could no longer bear it, and used a killing move: they summoned Ling Han for a trial to “investigate” the truth behind the deaths of Shi Ming and the others.

Yet Ling Han had disappeared!

This move caught the Gao Faction unprepared. They searched Ling Han’s quarters thoroughly in the name of the sect rules, yet they still did not manage to find him. This drove them crazy.

To prevent Ling Han from fleeing, they had already had people stand guard at the doors. As soon as Ling Han left, they would be putting him under surveillance. Yet the person who was on surveillance duty solemnly vowed that Ling Han had definitely not left the palace.

But where was he now? How had he disappeared?

Ling Han had not been sentenced yet. Thus, as a seed, he could naturally come and go as he pleased. This was not against the rules of the sect. Hence, the Gao Faction could not treat Ling Han as a criminal and stick up wanted posters for him everywhere.

...This was extremely interesting. To list Ling Han as a wanted criminal, they had to first prove that he had committed a crime. Yet Ling Han did not appear, so the trial could not be carried out. Then, he was innocent, and this was a complete cycle.

Thus, the Gao Faction could only mobilize their own forces to search for Ling Han in secret. The other factions might also have joined in as well, but they ultimately could not command the whole sect and launch a search on a greater scale.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was leisurely cultivating in the Black Tower. He had enough alchemical pills and True Origin Stones. Even if he was in the Black Tower, it did not affect his accumulation of Origin Power, and as he underwent comprehension underneath the Reincarnation Tree, it was natural that his grasp of the Regulations of this heaven and earth would be greatly improved day by day.

When the day that the auction would begin came, Ling Han quietly advanced into the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, and had become qualified to become a match for an opponent in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

“I have never been this powerful before!” he murmured to himself. No wonder Shen Zhu’er and the others had been so confident previously. If they had exhibited their full power, they could’ve indeed suppressed him easily. Of course, suppressing him was one matter, and wounding him was another.

“As for the Star Plucking Step, I have also grasped a bit of it. Cooperating with the present level of my Origin Power, I can definitely experience a short burst of speed that would surpass the majority of Sun Moon Tiers.

“It’s time to go to the auction!”

He exited the Black Tower, calmly opened the doors, and came out.

Pu!

Seeing him suddenly appear, the eyes of the person in charge of surveillance outside almost popped out. Even his brain short-circuited.

They were keeping a watch here, but it was merely routine business. After all, they had searched the palace a considerable number of times before. Who would have thought that Ling Han would actually come out from inside?

When they saw Ling Han, they only felt as if they had seen a monster!

Thus, it was only when Ling Han had walked quite some distance away that they came back to themselves, and shouted, “Stop right there!”

Ling Han smiled. ‘Just because you said so?’

Not only did he not stop, he instead ran even faster.

“Quick, send out a signal quickly! We’ve found Han Lin!” one of the people on watch duty said.

The other person nodded hurriedly, and drew out a signal bomb. Pa, a “Gao” letter instantly appeared in the skies. This was the unique communication method of the Gao Faction.

Suddenly, elites of the Sun Moon Tier appeared, and quickly rushed over. Additionally, there were even more Mountain River Tiers that had rushed here. However, they were much slower.

When they found out that Ling Han had appeared, they were both pleased and shocked. Their pleasure was because Ling Han had finally appeared, and their shock was due to the fact that today was the day of the auction!

“This brat must be rushing to deliver the goods to the auction!”

“Cut him off!”

“Old Yu, we’ll move separately. I will pursue by following the traces of that brat while you head directly for the auction,” an elite of Sun Moon Tier said.

“All right!” The other person nodded.

Two great elites of the Sun Moon Tier were moving separately. They had absolute confidence that whichever of them moved, they would be able to easily subdue Ling Han.

The one in pursuit of Ling Han was precisely Zhu Tianchou. Previously, he had experienced a loss in Ling Han’s hands in secret, so he would naturally bear a grudge against Ling Han. He wanted to apprehend Ling Han personally, and put him in a little bit of suffering first.

Zhu Tianchou’s speed was extremely fast. Though Ling Han circled and turned here and there, attempting to hide the traces, how powerful were the senses of the Sun Moon Tier? He pursued him the whole way, and in a short while, he could already catch sight of Ling Han’s back.

“Hahahaha, Han Lin, there is no way you can flee!” he declared wickedly.

“Hoho, you are threatening me again. Have you forgotten the lesson from last time?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

Zhu Tianchou almost exploded in anger. This brat actually dared to still speak of the matter from previously? He released a furious roar, and his feet suddenly sped up as he raced towards Ling Han. “Brat, don’t even think of running away this time!”

“That may not be the case!” Ling Han sped up as well. Xiu, he burst into a terrifying speed, which was actually not the slightest bit slower than Zhu Tianchou’s.

Star Plucking Step!
