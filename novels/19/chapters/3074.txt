3075 Beginning of the Final Battle

“Are you surprised?” Extermination asked as she looked at Ling Han. There was an eerie smile on her face.

“Indeed,” Ling Han replied with a nod. He looked at Wang Quanhe, his descendant across many generations.

Back then, Ling Han had already had a vague feeling that he was perhaps releasing a sinister demon into the wild. However, Wang Quanhe had been far too weak, so Ling Han had simply told Ling Jianxue to keep an eye on him, pushing him back onto the right track whenever he strayed.

The problem was, Wang Quanhe’s fortune was far too freakish, so much so that he was able to soar to the Heavenly Venerable Tier in spite of his mediocre talent and unstable cultivation.

After Wang Quanhe reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier, it would naturally be far more difficult to keep an eye on him.

Thus, he had suddenly disappeared into thin air one day.

However, Ling Han still hadn’t imagined that Wang Quanhe would one day appear before him as a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. Not only that, but he was also standing on the side of Extermination and Hysteria.

Why?

“By doing this, are you still able to keep a clear conscience?” Ling Han asked.

“There’s already no one else I care for in this world,” Wang Quanhe replied coldly. “Since that’s the case, so what if it’s destroyed? Moreover… you were clearly the most powerful Heavenly Venerate at that time, yet you failed to travel around to look for your descendants. It was your actions that led to the destruction of the Wang Clan.”

He paused for a moment, and an intense glimmer appeared in his eyes, revealing his uncontrollable rage. “Let me ask you, are you able to keep a clear conscience?”

This person was far too extreme. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s not too late to turn around and repent,” Ling Han said in a solemn voice. “Otherwise… I won’t show any mercy.”

“Haha! My body is indestructible, so how are you going to suppress me?” Wang Quanhe sneered coldly. He surprisingly took the initiative and charged at Ling Han.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

He launched three palm strikes in quick succession, with each strike carrying his full Seventh Tier power. These were incredibly powerful attacks.

However, could ordinary Seventh Tier ultimate elites faze Ling Han now? He simply replied with a casual tap of his finger, easily blocking all of Wang Quanhe’s attacks.

However, with Wang Quanhe holding him back, could Lin Luo and the others stop Hysteria?

Clearly not!

Even though they had four more Seventh Tier elites than before, Extermination was able to easily block all of them by herself.

“Enjoy the show. This is something that only Seventh Tier elites have the honor to watch!” Extermination said with loud laughter. It was as if she had become one with the void.

“Ling Han!” Lin Luo and the others exclaimed.

“I’ll go!” Bai Mifan roared as he charged over, attempting to block Wang Quanhe for Ling Han. That way, he could free their most powerful main force in Ling Han. However, would Extermination allow this? She launched a strike with her slender hand.

Peng!

A cloud of blood instantly exploded from Bai Mifan’s body.

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this.

Seventh Tier ultimate elites were undying and indestructible!

Yet, Bai Mifan was bleeding after facing a single strike? How could they not feel numb with shock?

Did Seventh Tier elites… ultimately have to face death as well?

Ling Han’s pupils contracted. Sure enough, Extermination’s battle prowess had also increased in leaps and bounds. She had most likely cultivated another dimension to the transcendent level, which allowed her power to increase explosively. It was because of this that she could wound Seventh Tier elites with a single strike.

He couldn’t waste his time on Wang Quanhe anymore. Otherwise, to say nothing of stopping Hysteria, all of his companions would be killed by Extermination.

“Freeze!” Ling Han commanded as he made a tapping motion at Wang Quanhe. A devastating restrictive power crashed down, forcefully pushing the groaning Wang Quanhe into the ground.

With a roar, Ling Han then charged at Extermination.

“Come!” Extermination cried as she charged over to meet Ling Han.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, causing their clothes to violently billow amid the void windstorms that were countless times more powerful than energy shock waves. The windstorms rapidly permeated into the surroundings.

Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others were all sent flying upon being struck by this storm. They were completely unable to withstand it.

They were all at the Seventh Tier, yet the gulf between them was clearly immense.

“I’ll deal with her. You guys go over to stop Hysteria,” Ling Han said.

“Understood!” Lin Luo and the others replied as they charged at Hysteria.

Chong Yan and the others tried to stop them, yet being fewer in number, they were naturally unable to fully stop Chong Yan and the others. Several attacks instantly slammed into Hysteria.

However, Hysteria didn’t react at all, and it simply extended its tentacles to tightly wrap around the Celestial Realm.

It had grown several times more powerful again. The attacks of Seventh Tier elites had been unable to wound it in the past, so this was further the case right now. The attacks were completely unable to affect it at all.

At this moment, Hysteria was only a single step away from achieving its dream. Once it engulfed this realm, it would be able to replace the Genesis World.

At that time, it would be able to do as it pleased. Thus, did it need to pay any heed to these measly insects?

Ling Han frowned and immediately charged at Hysteria.

“Heh, your opponent is me!” Extermination said as she lashed out in an attempt to stop Ling Han.

“Piss off!” Ling Han roared. He unleashed a punch, and a single symbol lit up on his forehead.

An intensely cold chill gripped at Extermination’s heart, and she surprisingly felt an immense sense of fear so powerful that she almost didn’t dare to face this strike. However, she immediately composed herself, and replied with a punch on her own.

They were both the most powerful beings in the world, so what was there for her to be afraid of?

Peng!

Ling Han’s punch struck Extermination head-on, instantly causing her to grunt in pain. She retreated rapidly, with blood furiously pouring from her mouth.

‘What?!’

She was unable to accept this. Not only had her full power strike failed to rival Ling Han, but she had even been wounded?

Ling Han’s punch had been far too terrifying.

Ling Han retracted his fist, with blood also seeping from the skin all over his body. Just then, he activated all of his Heavenly Venerable Seals and increased his power 100,000-fold. However, this had also placed a huge burden on his body.

In any case, he was indeed able to wound even Extermination after unleashing this powerful trump card.

Ling Han turned around and charged at Hysteria.

Peng!

He threw a punch, and a powerful energy wave gathered on his fist. The further his fist traveled, the more layers this energy wave would gain. It was as if the void were being compressed by him and smashing toward Hysteria along with his fist.

This strike was far too terrifying. Hysteria roared upon being struck, and it immediately retracted all of its tentacles like an ordinary mortal pulling their hand back from an open flame.

Hysteria was colossal as it lay in the void, and it brandished its countless tentacles around as it glared at Ling Han with its huge eyes.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

Hundreds of tentacles slammed over.

Ling Han swung his fists to block these attacks.

Peng, peng, peng!

Each swing of his fist was able to send a tentacle flying.

His movements were insanely quick, and after throwing several thousand punches, Hysteria finally stopped attacking him with its tentacles. This was because its tentacles were pulsating with light in an extremely unstable manner.

It had been wounded during their fierce exchanges.

Ling Han was also drenched in blood. He had channeled his supreme combination seal, so each attack had caused him to suffer some light wounds. With all the light wounds combined together, this was naturally no longer a light wound.

However, what could he do? If he didn’t unleash this power, how could he possibly force Hysteria to retreat?

“Ling Han, you’re truly full of surprises!” Extermination said as she slowly strolled over in the void.

“However, you can’t stop this inevitable trend of the time!”

Boom!

Hysteria and Extermination joined forces to unleash frenzied attacks at Ling Han.

“To make the impossible possible, and to defy the will of the heavens… This is what it means to be a cultivator!” Ling Han roared as he charged over to face their attacks.

The final battle officially began.
