Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The might of the Three Styles of the God of War was too strong, but precisely because of this, the burden on Ling Han was also incredibly great. Previously, he had only used it once, and had not used it again.

Even if he was already an Enlightenment Tier, it was still a great pressure for him to use.

It was only after a few breaths that Ling Han’s blood and Qi calmed down. His physique was too tough, and after a few moments of rest, he had more or less recovered. However, he was still unable to immediately channel the Three Styles of the God of War. That would be asking for his own suffering, or even courting death.

At this time, Meng Yangcheng had already disappeared, so Ling Han didn’t pursue him. Even if he used the Imminent Skyline, it was useless. With Meng Yangcheng’s intelligence, he probably wouldn’t walk a straight line.

Ling Han let the little loli out.

“Yi, the Divine Temple?” Tang Yun’er was surprised. Then, she pointed at Ling Han, “Damn Handsome Brother, didn’t you say that was a desert mirage?”

‘Tve already brought you in, so why are you complaining so much?” Ling Han said with a smile.

The little loli pouted, but she was immediately attracted by the Divine Temple. Let s go, let’s go in and take a look. I’m so curious!”

Ling Han was also slightly curious, and the two of them walked towards the door.

The large temple was incredibly majestic, its golden walls brilliant, but it was obvious that it had suffered great damage. There were multiple cracks on the walls. Some seemed to be sword marks, some were saber marks, and some seemed to have been clawed out with bare hands.

If Meng Yangcheng was here, he would know that these marks of damage were left behind by the great battle all those years ago.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the Buddhist Race had used this temple as a stronghold to advance all the way, and only when the old Emperor moved was their advance stopped.

The doors to the Divine Temple were closed, but the doors themselves had been damaged, revealing a massive hole that they could easily worm through. The two of them entered, “An… Ma… Ni…?” The chanting sounded again.

“Yi, this is the Six Figures Bright King Curse!” The little loli immediately called out, her face filled with shock.

“What Bright King Curse, Ghost King Curse?” Ling Han grabbed the little loli. “This is one of the ultimate techniques of the Buddhist Race. The Nine Figures of Truth are capable of suppressing all enemies in the world, while the Six Characters Bright King Curse is capable of eliminating evil and enlightening the mind.” The little loli chattered, like a little sparrow, “You have to know that the Buddhist Race is most skilled in dealing with ghosts and evil beasts. Furthermore, they are also very skilled in eliminating internal demons.”

“If you learn this Six Characters Bright King Curse, you basically won’t have to worry about being disturbed by evil beasts in the future, and you won’t have to worry about having internal demons either.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Sh*tty Handsome Brother, do you know that after advancing into Celestial Path, every increase in cultivation level would mean being disturbed by an internal demon? Heavenly Dao tests the heart, and there is a possibility of becoming a demon at the slightest provocation?”

“However, if you have learnt the Six Figures Bright King Curse, the chances of becoming a demon will be ninety percent lesser!”

“In this world, who knows how many people want to learn the Six Characters Bright King Curse.”

Only then did Ling Han’s heart stir, and he said, “Isn’t that simple? Wouldn’t it be fine if we just listened for a while?”

The little loli rolled her eyes, “The six words are ‘An’, ‘Ma’, ‘Ni’, ‘Pei’, Mi’, and ’Ku’. Everyone knows this, but to simply say that these six words are the Bright King Curse, that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?”

There’s a secret to this, and it also requires a combination of Buddhist cultivation techniques.”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, “That so-called Imperial Highness should also have come for the Six Characters Bright King Curse, so this place should have the inheritance of the Buddhist Race.”

“Let’s hurry up and find it,” the little loli said excitedly. “If I can learn it, then Maternal Grandfather, Paternal Grandfather and the others will definitely praise me!”

Ling Han nodded. He had never been one to enjoy the benefits alone. Since the little loli could also come here, it meant that she was fated with Buddhism… en, he was already beginning to imagine how the little loli would look like if she shaved her head.

The temple was not dark. There were multiple stone Buddhas inside, and every Buddha was glowing, their postures different.

The two of them arrived at the end of the temple, and saw that there was a giant Buddha sitting there. It was as tall as thirty meters, and had a crystalline golden body. It looked majestic, and the sound of chanting was precisely coming from here. It could be claimed to be a divine miracle.

In front of the giant Buddha, there were twelve mats, which were divided into two rows, one in front and one at the back, and there were six mats in each row.

And now, there were five people sitting cross-legged on these twelve mats. Some were tall, some were short, and the shortest was only the size of a thumb, while the tallest was like a meter tall Guardian Deity.

Ling Han had already examined them with his eye technique. These five people were all corpses, but although they were dead, they still had a kind of might. They should have been very powerful when they were alive.

These five people were all dressed in Buddhist robes, and should be people from the Buddhist Race.

The Buddhist Race was a general name. As long as one believed in Buddhism, they could be called a member of the Buddhist Race. Thus, these five people ’ clearly came from different races, yet could belong to the Buddhist Race.

These five people were definitely not Saints. Though there was still lingering power after their deaths, it was not so strong that they could not be approached. Ling Han circled around the five of them once, and discovered that there were obvious injuries on their bodies. Their religious robes had been pierced, and they were all fatally wounded.

So strange. They didn’t think of a way to treat their injuries, or find a place to rest in peace, but actually sat cross-legged on a mat?

“Where’s the inheritance? Where’s the inheritance?” The little loli spun around m circles. She didn’t have the slightest interest in dead people and the Buddha statue.

The two of them searched everywhere, but even after searching the entire temple, they did not find anything that looked like an inheritance.

“Sigh, what a waste of effort.” Tang Yun’er shrugged her shoulders, and said, “Perhaps these people knew that they would definitely die, so they destroyed the inheritance.”

This was indeed possible.

They were unwilling to give up. They searched for another day, but still came up empty-handed.

“The Divine Temple legends are all lies.” The little loli pouted. “It’s extremely immoral to lie to children!”

The two of them exited the Divine Temple. There was a small plaza outside, and there was a Bodhi Tree growing there. However, it had long since wilted, and there was even half of it missing, making for a very desolate sight.

The Bodhi Tree was the spiritual totem of the Buddhist Race. According to legends, the Buddhist Ancestor comprehended Dao underneath the Bodhi Tree.

A thought suddenly flashed through Ling Han’s mind. Could this Bodhi Tree be the true inheritance?

No one made it a rule that the inheritance had to be carried out inside the temple.

Ling Han walked over and began to study the Bodhi Tree.

“Handsome Brother, you’re really smart!” Tang Yun’er ran over as well. She naturally knew of the legend of the Bodhi Tree.

The two of them studied it together, but no matter how they observed, this was a dead Bodhi Tree.

“Let’s go.” Tang Yun’er was obviously an impatient person. Moreover, she was only a few years old.

“Don’t be impatient,” Ling Han said.

“Boring.” The little loli took out some candy and began licking it.

Ling Han sat down in a cross-legged position. Since Buddha had comprehended Dao underneath the Bodhi Tree, would he be able to pass on the Dao of Buddha underneath the Bodhi Tree?

He sat down, but nothing happened.

There was no enlightenment, nor was there a harsh warning. There was nothing.

“Handsome Brother, don’t waste time,” the little loli said from the side.

“Let’s wait for a while longer,” Ling Han said.

The day passed, and night fell. The golden moon hung high in the sky, casting a gentle light.

The little loli had already fallen into a deep slumber. She had no worries, so she could naturally eat and sleep leisurely.

Was he really unable to obtain the inheritance?

Ling Han thought internally. He decided that if there was still no change by tomorrow morning, he would leave.

When the moon reached the middle of the sky, a sudden change took place..
