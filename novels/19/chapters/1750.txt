Chapter 1751: Come learn alchemy with me

‘Huh?’

The Fu Siblings were looking at Ling Han with surprise. No way, this brat actually made a connection with Elder Yan?

It should be known that Xiang Yan was one of the very most important resources of the Fu Clan!

In the Celestial Realm, alchemists were still a class that surpassed the rest. There was a pitifully small number of Celestial level alchemists, and every single one would be recruited by the various powerful forces, which would be willing to spare no expense in recruiting them.

There was no helping it. There were always conflicts and battles among the powerful forces and minor forces, and there occasionally would be casualties and deaths.

With a high-grade alchemist, one could greatly increase the survival chances of the elites among their ranks.

Xiang Yan was a three-star alchemist.

In the Celestial Realm, there were a total of five levels for alchemists. One star corresponded to the Severing Mundane Tier, two stars corresponded to Dividing Soul Tier, and a three-star alchemist naturally corresponded to Immortal Palace Tier.

The Fu Clan had been able to recruit Xiang Yan because the grand elder of the Fu Clan had once saved Situ Tang’s life. Later on, Situ Tang chose to join the Fu Clan and become their personal alchemist, and at that time, Xiang Yan was still Situ Tang’s good friend, so he came along with him.

Though Xiang Yan and Situ Tang had turned hostile now, Xiang Yan still had no plans of leaving. However, the Fu Clan was very concerned because the other three-star forces had always been secretly making contact with Xiang Yan.

A high-grade alchemist was comparable to 10 elites of the same level!

The Fu Clan naturally would not let go of Xiang Yan for any reason, and thus all the members of the entire clan were incredibly respectful towards Xiang Yan.

Could it be that Ling Han had offended Xiang Yan?

Hiss, this was very serious. If Xiang Yan was determined to target Ling Han, then even the grand elder of the Fu Clan could possibly move out personally.

A high-grade alchemist was really that awesome.

Bei Xuanming showed a cold smirk. So as it turned out, this brat had offended a high-grade alchemist, haha! It should be known that the part of the reason that the Lunar Sect wanted to form an alliance with the Fu Clan through matrimony was because they had designs on those two three-star alchemists.

If Xiang Yan’s relations with the Fu Clan became hostile due to this, he could take advantage of the opportunity and pull him over to their side to strengthen the power of the Lunar Sect.

Even Fu Gaoyun could not help but cautiously ask, “Elder Yan, it’s nothing major, right?”

In front of this high-grade alchemist, he really did not dare put on the airs of the heir of the Fu Clan.

In fact, even if he became the patriarch of the Fu Clan, he would still have to be polite to Xiang Yan.

Xiang Yan turned around and glared at him harshly, his beard practically rising. He smacked a palm onto Fu Gaoyun’s head. “Nothing major? Nothing major? You actually dare to undermine what I have invested my whole life into!”

This was the Winds and Fires Nine Clouds Pill, and he had invested who knew how much blood, sweat, and tears into it, and what did he actually say? He was really going to die from fury here.

Ah, so serious! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Fu Gaoyun did not even dare dodge, and allowed Xiang Yan to land a solid hit. However, this slap was naturally not heavy. He looked at Ling Han plaintively.

‘Just how much of a trouble maker are you?

‘Just how long have you been in here, and you have already offended the person that you cannot afford to offend the most? What should I say about you?’

He gritted his teeth, and exclaimed, “Ling Han, quickly, admit your fault!”

He signalled at Ling Han with his eyes. What he meant was to quickly apologize to this great alchemist, and he would say a few nice words so that this big problem became a small one, and the small problem could be turned into no problem at all.

When Bei Xuanming heard this, he immediately leaped out with a cold sneer.

What a joke; how could he possibly allow this matter to be easily resolved like this? If he could not deal with Ling Han, then he could make use of the Fu Clan to get rid of Ling Han. Hehe, what you should not have done the most was to offend an alchemist, and one that was a three-star alchemist at that.

It could be said that as long as Xiang Yan was willing to join the Lunar Sect, the sect master of the Lunar Sect could even repeal him, the Holy Son.

He was that awesome!

“Brother Fu, your words are wrong. Alchemists are beings that surpass the rest, and now that this person has offended Elder Yan, how could it be forgiven with a simple apology?” He smirked. “If this kind of criminal was not heavily punished, wouldn’t it be a challenge to the prestige of all alchemists?”

Fu Gaoyun glared harshly at him, and felt that this guy was really too despicable. He could not match Ling Han in strength, and actually used such a method to get his revenge. He was really undeserving of being a king tier!

Fu Xiaoyun also revealed a hint of disdain. She could accept her man having lost a battle, but he definitely could not have the trait of a sore loser.

Bei Xuanming gritted his teeth. He could not bother about her now. If he did not get Ling Han killed, what would there be left of his pride?

“What are you little bastards blabbering about?” Xiang Yan demanded impatiently. Couldn’t they allow him to finish his words properly?

“Elder Yan!” Both Fu Gaoyun and Bei Xuanming lowered their heads in respect.

It could not be helped. An alchemist had spoken, and putting aside juniors like them, even Immortal Palace Tier elites would have to give him some face.

However, Fu Gaoyun was grimacing, while Bei Xuanming showed an expression as if his dastardly scheme had succeeded.

“Brat Ling, are you interested to come learn alchemy with me?” Xiang Yan finally opened his mouth to ask a question with a smile when he saw that everyone had become quiet.

Damn!

Instantly, Fu Gaoyun, Bei Xuanming, Changsun Liang, and the others all felt their minds shake, and they almost collapsed onto the ground.

Had they heard wrongly?

Xiang Yan was actually asking Ling Han if he had interest in learning alchemy?

Th-th-th-th-this meant that he wanted to take Ling Han as his disciple!

The class of alchemists was extremely proud and aloof because there would only be others begging them, and it would never happen the other way around. Furthermore, the requirements for becoming an alchemist were extremely sharsh. Thus, there was an extremely limited number of them, which further increased the importance of this group.

Celestials had an unlimited lifespan, and those like Fu Gaoyun and Bei Xuanming were definitely involved in other fields outside of cultivation, such as music. In truth, what they wanted the most was to gain the status of alchemist as well. That would really be too awesome.

But the problem was that it was not something that was possible just because they wanted to.

And now this opportunity that others could only dream about was laid in front of Ling Han.

Even Fu Gaoyun was beginning to envy Ling Han. He had begged Xiang Yan who knew how many times, but the latter would always have an expression of dislike on his face, and tell him to get lost with a dismissive wave.

Bei Xuanming’s face had turned green; as it turned out, he had been playing the role of a joker for all this while.

He wasn’t here to punish Ling Han harshly, but rather wanted to take the latter as his disciple.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “No, thanks. My ambition lies in martial arts and cultivation.”

Hearing Ling Han’s words of rejection, everyone collectively turned into stone.

Such a great opportunity, and you actually refused so decisively and resolutely!

To compare themselves against him would surely drive them crazy.

Xiang Yan also felt slightly like going crazy, and exclaimed, “What is so good about cultivation? As long as you have advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, your lifespan would be unlimited. Moreover, as long as your achievement in alchemy is outstanding, you could also advance through the cultivation levels through alchemy, and attain the supreme tier of Celestial King Tier!”

He was a little proud. “For example, me. After advancing into the Severing Mundane, I have not cultivated a single day. Every day, I would only be concocting alchemical pills, and you see, in just over 20 billion years, I am already at the level of Heaven Soul.”

He had only reached Heaven Soul in over 20 billion years?

Ling Han shook his head. He possessed the Black Tower, and it was highly possible that he would be targeted by supreme elites. How did he have so much time that he could calmly cultivate at his leisure? Furthermore, he still had to find his wife and son, so how could he possibly stay here?

“No,” he replied.

Xiang Yan really wanted to strangle Ling Han’s neck, and force him to nod and agree. This was giving him an opportunity to become an alchemist, but why was his expression full of dislike? It should be known that he only had to announce that he wanted to take a disciple, and it was guaranteed that the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of the major sects and the heirs of the top-tier noble clans would all line up in front of him to freely choose from.

And now he had taken the initiative to speak up, yet Ling Han actually refused once, and then refused a second time.

‘What exactly is wrong with your head, brat!?’
