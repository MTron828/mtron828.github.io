Chapter 2245: Appearance of Monarch Stars

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At least on the side of the Celestial Realm, Ji Wuming, Hong Huang, Ailean, Xing Chenyue, and the other Monarch Stars were all in seclusion at a mysterious location. It was rumored that there were mighty figures that were presently nurturing them to the best of their efforts. The moment they appeared, their strength would definitely shock the world.

Perhaps it was the same for the side of the Foreign Realm, but without the appearance of Monarch Stars, this battle would simply continue intensely, and would not be leaning towards either side.

All in all, it was indeed the Foreign Realm that was stronger, but in this neutral zone, their advantage had been greatly limited.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The battle was incredibly intense. No, this was a war, a war that had broken out for the sake of the Origin Magic Cube.

And within the Origin Magic Cube, Ling Han suddenly awoke.

In these thousand-odd years, he had maintained a muddleheaded state while barraged by the endless Regulations within the Origin Magic Cube, just passively sustaining the barrage. Aside from that, there were also techniques used to control this Origin Magic Cube to channel this world.

And now, he had finally received all the information.

With a thought,?boom, a fiery flame burned, and his body was immediately reformed. His naked body was exuding a wide, broad life essence like a smoke signal.

This world… belonged to him!

This was a feeling that could not be described. The whole neutral zone was under his control. With only a single thought from him, the heavens would crumble and earth would crack at his will.

He was the overlord of the entire world. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In this place, he needed not worry any further about the problem of running out of Regulations. In fact, he did not even need the Regulations to replenish him, because he was the overlord of this world, and was superior to even Regulations.

Then what did he need Regulations for anymore?

‘Would I be able to kill Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings now—if the latter entered into this world?’ Ling Han thought. This world could reach the height of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, which also meant that the upper limits of his power should also be Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Since it was connected to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, it definitely had to be superior to the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

They weren’t even on the same level.

‘However, if those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm, the Eighteenth Lotus elites, knew that I have gained the Origin Magic Cube, they would definitely not dare to step into this space, or would even ask a Heavenly Venerate to interfere directly to destroy this world. Then, not only would I be unable to kill the Foreign Realm elites, it would also be a great loss,’ Ling Han thought.

He was presently the overlord of this world, and could endlessly extract the power of heaven and earth for his own use. This rate of progress was astonishingly rapid. In fact, he could set Regulations himself, and did not have to go to any Mystery Realm at all to directly increase his cultivation level.

Even the heaven and earth listened to his say, so cultivation was naturally a piece of cake.

“No!” He immediately shook his head. The cultivation he gained in this world would only be suitable for this world. Otherwise, the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm would not recognize it at all, and could even possibly target him.

“Too bad!” Ling Han shook his head. “However, if I plan properly, who knows, I might be able to kill a great many Foreign Realm elites through trickery, and by then, the military merit I would be earning would be astonishingly great.”

In Clear Heaven Pass, in the resistance against the Foreign Realm elites, military merits would be allocated after each battle, especially after killing Foreign Realm elites. That military merit would be astonishingly huge.

This military merit was not determined by someone, but rather by the heavens itself.

The heaven and earth had consciousness, or how could there be Regulations? Previously, it had advanced the descent of Dragon’s Gate Mountain, and that was the heaven and earth trying to save itself.

Military merits could be used to trade for cultivation resources, but the most valuable was access to the Reincarnation Gates. It would allow a cultivator to reincarnate and come back to life, but this required great military merits, and would grant a cultivator a chance to start back from the beginning.

If Ling Han killed an Eighteenth Lotus elite, then could he trade that for enough Godly metal so that he could advance the Divine Demon Sword to the level of a Celestial Tool from the heavens?

Furthermore, if his luck was good, it was not just one Eighteenth Lotus elite that he could kill through trickery.

Thus, with a thought,?xiu, the Origin Magic Cube immediately moved, and turned into a streak of light that disappeared without a trace in an instant.

“What, where is the Core of heaven and earth?” Everyone was battling fiercely, and when they saw the Origin Magic Cube suddenly vanish, they were all stunned, and involuntarily ceased fighting.

…The treasure was gone, so what was the point of continuing to fight?

“Who did it?” someone asked, flustered and exasperated.

“It must be those monsters of the Foreign Realm!”

“It was you trash!”

Both sides were blaming each other, both thinking that it was the other side that had done something, and caused the Origin Magic Cube to disappear.

Weng, a frightening aura surged over, and a figure appeared. It was a human-shaped creature, but had the hooves of a cow and the wings of a bat, with a long tail trailing behind him. There was a single horn sprouting from his head, and his skin was crimson red.

“Gaddalon!” When they saw this person, everyone on the Foreign Realm’s side cheered, as if he was a supreme Celestial King.

Gaddalon’s eyes swept over them, his gaze incredibly sharp and filled with endless intimidation. The cultivators of the Celestial Realm felt like they were about to explode just from this one glance from him.

What kind of person was this? He was too powerful.

“Die!” A prodigy of the Celestial Realm moved, and grabbed out at Gaddalon. He was a Fifth Secret monarch tier, a native of Clear Heaven Pass, and a descendant of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

Gaddalon merely regarded him coldly, and when that prodigy of the Celestial Realm had neared, he finally moved. His movements were not really very fast, but just by raising his hand, he made that Celestial Realm prodigy’s neck fall into his grasp.

Ka, a crisp crack rang out, and the neck of the Celestial Realm prodigy was already broken, all life instantly erased from him.

Insta-kill!

A Fifth Secret monarch tier had actually been insta-killed.

‘How is this possible?!’

Those Celestial Realm cultivators on the scene were all stunned. Theoretically speaking, a Fifth Secret monarch tier should be the strongest force here. True, there were still differences in strength among Fifth Secret monarch tiers, but it was absolutely impossible that the gap could be so far as to result in an insta-kill.

“Monarch…. Monarch Star!” someone exclaimed in a trembling voice.

Finally, a Monarch Star had appeared. This was an existence that surpassed the monarch tier, someone unimaginably powerful. It was said that it was certain that they could become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and had supreme aptitude.

The Foreign Realm had mobilized a Monarch Star, and it would completely alter the scales of victory in this war.

“Gaddalon!” The cultivators of the Foreign Realm all cheered and yelled, extremely overcome with excitement.

But Gaddalon did not look the slightest bit proud. As he saw it, wasn’t it just a matter of course to insta-kill a Fifth Secret monarch tier? What need was there for such fuss? He merely swept a glance over them, and asked, “Where is the Origin Magic Cube?”

“It has been retrieved through some unknown means by these weaklings of the Celestial Realm,” a Foreign Realm elite answered.

“Nonsense, it is clearly you all that stole it!” the cultivators of the Celestial Realm immediately retorted.

Gaddalon smirked coldly, exuding a supreme air of eerie coldness. Instantly, everyone fell silent, feeling a sudden chill arise, and feeling indescribably uncomfortable.

He stated calmly, “At first, I would not even deign to kill such trash like you guys, but you have hidden the Origin Magic Cube. That is just courting death!”

Peng, with a flash of his figure, he instantly turned into several hundred afterimages.

Pa, pa, pa, pa.?In only that one instant, several hundred Immortal Palace Tiers of the Celestial Realm were slaughtered. There were excellent students that came from the Saintly Origin Academy among them, as well as prodigies among the natives, but most of them were Immortal Palace Tiers from the various great forces of Clear Heaven Pass.

With such a massacre, everyone from the Celestial Realm felt it difficult to swallow.

Too powerful!

They, too, were Immortal Palace Tiers, so why was there such a huge difference? Who would be able to withstand a bringer of slaughter like this? It was probable that he alone would be able to kill all the Celestial Realm elites here.

“You dare to touch those of our Celestial Realm.. Are you tired of living?” An incredibly proud voice rang out, and a figure was seen streaking forth from afar at an astonishing speed.
