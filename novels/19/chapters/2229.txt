Chapter 2230: Docking pay

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was possible that the neutral zone was presently nurturing an Ascending Origin Tier creature.

For Clear Heaven Pass, this matter was actually not all that important, because what was an Ascending Origin Tier worth? Any random Celestial King would be able to crush it to dust.

Hence, Ling Han thought for a moment, and did not waste time on this matter.

After all, nothing would happen as long as he was careful.

Moreover, if that creature could emerge, it meant that the neutral zone would be able to admit Ascending Origin Tier power. Then, the Celestial Realm would also be able to allow the entry of Ascending Origin Tier powerhouses, and they could suppress it as well.

With this in mind, Ling Han decided to set the matter aside for now—of course, he was not going to give it up so easily.

He was studying that celestial medicine and strange creature inside the Black Tower.

The neutral zone was indeed strange. Celestial medicines did not grow in the ground, but rather in the bodies of living creatures.

“Hold on, is this a new form of life?” Ling Han suddenly paused. The celestial medicine and fierce beast coexisted in one body. As expected, only a new heaven and earth could give rise to such a creature.

“Still, what is the use of this celestial medicine?”

Ling Han took a fruit and consumed it. Suddenly, an expansive power surged in his body. There was a slightly familiar side to it, but it also had an extremely evil side, but the larger composition was a never before seen powerful energy.

He felt it carefully. ‘The two Realms clash, but the Regulations have not completely merged. Thus, one part of this celestial medicine is the Regulations of the Celestial Realm, and one part belongs to the Foreign Realm, but more than that, it is made up of completely new Regulations that were produced after the two merged.

‘If I have enough celestial medicines, I may be able to deduce some Regulations of the Foreign Realm.’

Regulations were not universal in use, but the power was the same.

This celestial medicine could still boost the level of Ling Han’s Origin Power, pushing it to a higher level.

He consumed the remaining celestial fruits, and experienced the effects carefully. In terms of overall level of Origin Power, he had reached the heights of middle stage First Secret, but his comprehension of Regulations was still in the early stage, and had practically not moved further.

After all, every further step in the Immortal Palace Tier would need far, far too much time.

“I’ll need to get some more celestial medicines,” Ling Han mumbled.

He was very intrigued by that neutral zone, and wanted even more to find out what kind of creature was being nurtured underground, and it just so happened that after this mission, Nie Heshan had also assigned them many days of vacation, allowing them to move freely.

Ling Han thus decided to call the Rain Emperor and the others, and venture once more into the neutral zone.

He had not yet set out when a great amount of cultivation resources had been sent to the campsite, and they were distributed by the respective team leaders.

“Chen Long… Sui Bo…” Shen Chao called the names of his teammates one after another to distribute the resources. “Lu Zhen.” The resources he had previously distributed were all to the natives, and Ling Han and the others were the last five to be called.

Lu Zhen stepped forwards. When Shen Chao tossed him a Spatial God Tool, he inspected it, and his expression instantly changed as he demanded, “Why is there only just this bit of cultivation resources?”

“What is it? Complaining that it is too little?” Shen Chao glanced at him, a hint of disdain in his expression.

“Hehehe!” The other native team members all walked over, arms crossed over their chests as malicious smiles covered their faces.

Lu Zhen opened his mouth to say something, but in the end, he did not speak, and simply stepped aside.

Shen Chao’s lips twitched slightly, looking extremely contemptuous, and then called out, “Mei Hua.”

Mei Hua stepped forwards, and after he took a Spatial God Tool, he similarly looked outraged. “This is only 10% of the last distribution!”

“So what?” Shen Chao looked at him coldly, his eyes fierce, looking like a fierce tiger that had its eye on prey. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Mei Hua was furious, but he dared not speak. He merely clenched his fists, and stepped back.

The remaining two were the same as well. The cultivation resources they obtained were pitifully little, yet they did not dare raise their objections towards Shen Chao.

“Han Lin!” Shen Chao finally called out Ling Han’s name.

Ling Han walked forwards.

Shua, Shen Chao tossed out a Spatial God Tool.

Ling Han grabbed it, and did a sweep with his divine sense. Involuntarily, he smirked coldly.

Amazing, there were just two Star Stones.

And this was the cultivation resources he deserved? Even the stupidest person would know that could not be possible. Shen Chao had to have docked his pay.

He flicked his finger, and said, “Previously, I quite admired you guys. Bleeding and sacrificing for the many generations of Celestial Realm! However, now I realize that I have been admiring the wrong people.”

Ling Han glanced over the natives. “Those who deserve admiration are your ancestors, and not trash like you. What difference do you people have compared to those outside now? You would only be repelling others, without thinking of the bigger picture at all!

“With you guys like this, we’re supposed to depend on you to guard the borders?

“That is really the biggest joke ever heard!”

When these words fell, the expressions of the natives immediately changed in unison.

It was not just this small team. Members of the other teams also walked over, glaring at Ling Han, their expressions fierce.

“When our ancestors were bleeding and sacrificing for the Celestial Realm, who knows where you were still drinking milk!”

“What right do you have to fault us? What have you done for the Celestial Realm?”

“The fact that you can stand here today was paid for with the blood and lives of our ancestors!”

The natives were all calling out loudly, rebuking Ling Han harshly.

Ling Han sneered, and said, “You are all right in what you say. Your ancestors do indeed deserve respect, but what does that have to do with you guys? You are all talking on and on about your ancestors, but does that have anything to do with you?”

Everyone couldn’t help but be silenced. At this moment, they actually couldn’t find words to refute Ling Han. All this while, they had always despised those who came from outside, and thought that the latter had enjoyed the peace that they had worked for. But in truth, at present, they indeed had not been doing anything worthwhile, and were just simply continuously pushing others aside.

“So what?” Shen Chao simply chose to be arrogant. “Our ancestors have sacrificed so much, so don’t tell me that we should not enjoy better treatment?”

“And this is the excuse you are using to dock my cultivation resources?” Ling Han laughed loudly. “You are truly shameless to the extreme!”

“Do you want to die?” Shen Chao looked at Ling Han coldly, his killing intent blazing.

“Hehe, isn’t the lesson I taught you the last time enough?” Ling Han asked with a grin.

Instantly, Shen Chao’s whole face was flushed red.

Losing to Ling Han could be considered an extreme humiliation for him.

…He was a Fifth Secret monarch tier, and he had actually lost to a mere First Secret. Even if the latter was a Monarch Star, he was not the slightest bit comforted.

Now, he had already become a laughing matter. Even those that he had usually looked down on would dare to glance at him in contempt, and he could only leave with a bowed head.

All this was because of Ling Han!

“Are you seeking death?” Shen Chao’s eyes were spitting fire.

“Brother Chao, this is the barracks!” someone reminded him. If he made a move here, no matter who was in the right, they would all be punished severely.

Shen Chao clenched his fists tightly, using so much force that his fingernails had sunk into his flesh, drops of blood seeping out. He forcibly suppressed the urge to commit murder, and exclaimed, “Han Lin, make sure you don’t let me see you outside!”

The threat in these words could not be more obvious. As long as Ling Han dared to leave Clear Heaven Pass, he would dare deliver a fatal strike.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and crooked a finger at Shen Chao. “Come on then, make your move. If you don’t, you’d be my grandson!”

“You’re seeking death!” At first, Shen Chao had already forcefully suppressed his fury, but how could he hold up to such provocation from Ling Han. Immediately, he raised his hands, and blasted towards Ling Han.

Peng!

Everyone felt their vision blur, and Shen Chao was already sent flying back heavily.

F***, what kind of magic was going on here?
