Chapter 574: Worries

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Hahahaha, Younger 1 Brother, do you have no confidence in your big brother?” Feng Po Yun laughed loudly.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “How could I not have confidence in you, Big Brother. But, I’ve personally witnessed the silver-colored divine spider. That’s definitely a Shattering Void Tier being, and possibly extremely high level.”

Feng Po Yun laughed as he nodded, and said, “Younger Brother, relax, I’m already in the seventh layer of the Shattering Void Tier!”

The Shattering Void Tier was humanity’s peak, so its seventh layer was the peak of peaks... almost invincible.

After Ling Han was momentarily startled, he said, “Never would’ve thought that Big Brother was actually this strong!”

Although appearance couldn’t represent one’s true age, this big brother’s blood and Qi soared through the sky, so he was apparently still in his prime; thus, when he charged into the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, he should still be able to maintain the vigorous blood and Qi he had now, enough to break through the void.

Otherwise, breaking open the void when one was old and decrepit, and Qi and blood was unable to keep up, it wouldn’t be a rare thing to die during the process of breaking open the void; such legends existed since the ancient times.

Feng Po Yun nodded, and said, “Younger Brother, your battle prowess is exceptional, and your martial talent is also amazing, advancing into the Flower Blossom Tier at merely twenty years of age. Even I was far from as good back then. In the future, it wouldn’t be difficult for you to advance into the Shattering Void Tier.

“However!” He paused momentarily, looking stern. “I always have an unknown fear that if I broke open the void, there would be terrifying consequences.”

Ling Han was puzzled, and said, “Big Brother, don’t you have to be the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier to shatter the void?”

Feng Po Yun nodded, and said, “Once one advances into the Shattering Void Tier, one will possess the ability to break open the void. However, the higher one’s tier, the less difficult it is. I’ve stalled in taking this step, for one in reluctance, and secondly due to the fear within me.”

Ling Han understood. After cultivating to an extremely high tier, one would naturally have a premonition of the future—not that one could see the future, but simply that after deciding to do something, an ill premonition would be felt.

It was the same for him in the previous life. When venturing into historic sites, after making a certain decision, a vigilance would unknowingly arise within him. He would then give up and make an opposite choice. However, this wasn’t omnipotent, or else he wouldn’t possibly have lost his physical body from the shock of the Black Tower.

“Since advancing into the Shattering Void Tier, one can cross into the god realm, and Big Brother has already reached the seventh layer of the Shattering Void Tier. According to reason, you should have a firm grasp,” Ling Han said, puzzled.

“I also can’t figure it out.” Feng Po Yun shook his head. “I once asked a few others, and they were like me, not daring to take that step carelessly, feeling that it was extremely likely for them to die.”

The few others he mentioned were definitely Shattering Void Tier beings.

“However, some people clearly knew why, yet were unwilling to say.” Feng Po Yun went on.

“Which ones?” Ling Han was suddenly struck by a realization.

“Heaven’s Sword Sect’s Sword King, Cloud Phoenix Sect’s Azure Phoenix Empress, Absolute Saber Sect’s Severing Heaven Saber, Azure Thunder Sect’s Thunder Emperor, Earth Dragon Sect’s Beast Snake King...” Feng Po Yun counted with his fingers and said, “As I’ve seen, Thunder Emperor and Azure Phoenix Empress should be at the Shattering Void Tier’s completion, and according to reason, they should be in more of a rush than me... so puzzling!”

Certainly. Upon reaching Shattering Void Tier’s completion, unless one became a god, there was no way to advance further; staying in the vast lands was simply waiting for death. However, entering the god realm would be different as it meant being no longer restricted by this world’s limits, possessing vast space for improvement.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It certainly is strange.”

“Younger Brother, there are extremely many sea tribe’s elites; among them, the Shattering Void Tier elites’ number is at least several times that of men. You’d better shape up!” Feng Po Yun patted Ling Han on the shoulder, speaking gravely and sincerely.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be gloomy. He didn’t think of doing anything to Helian Xun Xue, and this sea girl stuck to him on her own accord. This girl was a high level Heaven Tier warrior, and her staying by his side was equivalent to being near a time bomb. He couldn’t sit safe and still, but he had no way to get rid of her, either.

“I’ll go see the desolate north first.” Feng Po Yun got up, and with a step, he was instantly a thousand miles out; the elites of humanity’s peak were terrifying strong as expected.

Ling Han stared at Helian Xun Xue, suddenly coming up with an idea. He said, “Hai Niu, let’s play a game called ‘make an oath’.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“How do we play?” Helian Xunxue was naïve.

“You raise both your hands and say: no matter what happens in the future, you won’t harm a single hair of mine.” Ling Han began to get his ‘inoculation’.

...

Although Feng Po Yun left, the forces that threatened Ling Han earlier didn’t dare to go back on their word, sending over their compensation that night. Ling Han counted and discovered that he had thirty thousand more Origin Crystals, and they were all three-stars level.

This was the face of a Shattering Void Tier elite!

It seemed that the Thousand Corpse Sect wouldn’t return in the near time. However, setting up the Fourth Killing Formation to completely massacre an entire city despite the risk of becoming the target of all... just how precious was the thing the Thousand Corpse Sect sought? They absolutely wouldn’t give up like this, and would definitely stage a comeback.

Everyone could guess that the thing that the Thousand Corpse Sect sought was definitely a supreme treasure, so on the same night, the city became extremely bustling as everyone began playing the game of treasure hunt.

The problem was that no one knew what the treasure the Thousand Corpse Sect targeted was, and even if they found it, they’d miss it unknowingly. Still, Treasures stirred people’s hearts, and not only did the treasure hunt game not end, it became even fiercer. Large forces didn’t hesitate to purchase properties and dug down three feet deep to search.

Ling Han was also curious, but thinking that it was a most valuable treasure for the Thousand Corpse Sect, it might not be useful for other martial artists.

What did Thousand Corpse Sect want the most?

First, first-class Corpse Soldier materials, or just corpses of elites—the stronger, the better. Second, Corpse Qi—this was their power source and the Corpse Soldiers’ power supply.

For a tenth-tier Spirit Tool, the Thousand Corpse Sect would appear in public and set up the Fourth Killing Formation; this was something that Ling Han just couldn’t believe.

Then, buried underneath Million Treasures City was either a large pile of Shattering Void Tier corpses, or a hidden source of Corpse Qi, which could make Thousand Corpse Sect’s overall strength increase drastically in a short time.

These two things Ling Han had no interest in.

At this time, the Spirit Treasures Pavilion’s eight Pavilion Masters and Alchemist Society’s two Heaven grade alchemists finally returned. Obviously, they gained nothing; even Ling Han, the genuine Alchemy Emperor, didn’t know where his belongings of the previous life were, let alone other people.

Once they returned, the five regions’ Spirit Treasures Pavilion’s contest was also brought up to schedule and wasn’t cancelled because of the Thousand Corpse Sect surrounding the city. With a Shattering Void Tier elite keeping watch, Million Treasures City could be said to be safe and stable... unless the Thousand Corpse Sect could set up the complete Fourth Killing Formation.

However, if they were able to set it up, wouldn’t they have already done it, not going through the hassle of doing it twice?

Temporarily, Million Treasures City returned to normal; as for when the Thousand Corpse Sect would stage a comeback, it was unclear.

Ling Han cultivated diligently in seclusion. Feng Po Yun left the rest of the Monkey’s Wine to him. Although taking it again, the benefits wouldn’t be as evident, his cultivation clearly increased. More importantly, he achieved a breakthrough on the sword path.

The twentieth flash of Sword Qi was about to form!
