3247 Jining City

A Meridian Opening Tier had killed a Blood Transformation Tier. Moreover, it was a Fifth Change at that. If one really saw such a thing with their own eyes, they would still doubt their eyes.

The battle was over now, but the two of them still could not say a word.

“Humph! Humph!” The little pink pig ran back and began to spit at Ling Han’s feet.

— Daring to use Lord Pig as a shield?

—and he even threw Lord Pig out like a brick?

‘I’ll spit you to death, you b@stard.’

“Little piggy, don’t be rude to Young Master!” Huan Xue rushed out and picked up the little piggy.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “If you spit at me again, I’ll immediately turn you into a roasted suckling pig.”

The little pink pig wasn’t afraid at all, and continued to spit at Ling Han. Who was afraid of who?

“Ling Han, I really have to thank you this time,” Butler Mu said, his face full of emotion. Who would have thought that he, a dignified Extreme Bone Tier martial artist, would actually need the help of a Meridian Opening Tier martial artist?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It is fortunate that Butler Mu gave me a movement technique. Otherwise, I would only be able to watch helplessly as Hu Can escaped just now.”

Meanwhile, Feng Ruoxian looked at Ling Han curiously. Although she had seen Ling Han before, and he had left a certain impression on her, she had been a high and mighty little princess at that time, and her curiosity towards Ling Han had only flashed past in a flash.

But now, she was truly shocked.

Ling Han’s battle achievements were too brilliant. With his Meridian Opening Tier cultivation level, he had killed a Fifth Change of Blood Transformation Tier. This was completely capable of shaking the entire Dark North Nation.

“Butler Mu, what are your future plans?” Ling Han asked.

Butler Mu thought for a moment and said, “We have to contact the capital as soon as possible.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Then let’s go to the next city. Young Miss can use the optical computer to communicate, and Butler Mu can also recuperate.”

“All right.”

The five of them set off. Butler Mu was carried on Sun Jianfang’s back as they trekked through the mountains and rivers.

There weren’t many cities in the Dark North Nation. It couldn’t be helped. When the previous civilization had fallen, more than 99% of humans had been killed by Demonic Beasts. However, the Dark North Nation was especially large, so the distance between cities was very far. The area ruled by each city was also very large.

Theoretically speaking, even if the Xuanqing Banner and the others frequently entered the deep mountains to conduct a sweep of Demonic Beasts, they could only ensure that there were no powerful Demonic Beasts in the periphery of the city. How could an army be dispatched to sweep places like the Thousand Lotus Mountains?

‘Why?’

It was impossible for a beast tide to erupt for no reason. Did something happen deep in the mountains, or was there another reason?

Ling Han was also puzzled. Although he knew a little about the situation, he really could not think of any reason why that mysterious force would need to annihilate Huju City.

Hold on.

A thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Back then, that Demonic Beast from the Thousand Lotus Mountain had attacked the surrounding villages and towns, which was why Team Seven had been dispatched to kill it. In the end, it was proven that this was not a result of that mysterious force accidentally letting that Demonic Beast escape, but a deliberate act.

It was feeding on humans?

If this was not wrong, then was it possible that this beast tide was actually a hunt?

…Using all the people in the city as prey for those spirit-type Demonic Beasts to kill and eat?

Hiss!

Ling Han’s fists clenched involuntarily. If that was really the case, then this mysterious force was truly too deranged.

He knew that spirit-type Demonic Beasts would produce Blood Divine Crystals, and that mysterious force valued this very much. In that case, it made sense. The other party’s goal was the Blood Divine Crystal.

“Coo!” The little pink pig’s cry interrupted Ling Han’s thoughts. It had a depressed expression, and looked very hurt.

This was because it had “changed its mind” after seeing Feng Ruoxian. It wanted to throw itself into Feng Ruoxian’s arms and ask for a hug, but its appearance, which could charm thousands of girls, was completely useless in front of Feng Ruoxian. It was mercilessly rejected.

Feng Ruoxian stayed far away from it. She was a clean freak. No matter how cute and clean the little pink pig looked, the thought of it crawling on the ground with its four hooves made her feel disgusted.

Moreover, this guy had a habit of spitting. What if he spat on her?

“Yi, there are also occasions when you are met with failure?” Ling Han said with a smile, and pulled the pig over.

“Hmph!” The lecherous pig huffed at him, expressing its disdain.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He now felt that this pig was quite useful. If he could modify it, for example, if it wasn’t so lazy, then it should be even more useful.

For example, they could explore ancient sites. Anyway, its defense was invincible. They could completely charge around without reservations.

After spending more than ten days, they finally arrived at a complete town.

Before this, although they had passed by some villages and small towns, they had all been destroyed by the beast tide. This was because these villages and towns were situated on the path of the Demonic Beasts, and due to this great stroke of bad luck, they were met with great misfortune.

Here, they rented a car and headed towards Jining City.

Jining City was the closest city to Huju City. It had been established 50 years ago, and Huju City had only been established 20 years ago. It could be seen how difficult it was to expand the territory.

After another dozen plus days, they arrived at Jining City.

It couldn’t be helped. The road was too rough for travel.

Jining City was a new city with only 50 years of history. It had both ancient and modern characteristics. Looking down from above, one could see tall buildings that were hundreds of storeys tall as well as ancient stone and wood buildings.

Ling Han and the others drove into the city, and first found a hotel to stay in.

As long as one connected to the optical computer, he could transfer the money directly. There was no need to bring money with him at all. This was undoubtedly a very convenient thing.

Feng Ruoxian immediately contacted the Imperial Capital. Very quickly, the other side replied that they wanted her to stay in Jining City for a few days. The Imperial Capital would send a warship to pick her up.

The group settled down in peace. Ling Han sent Butler Mu to the hospital for an operation, while he concocted some healing medicinal pills. After Butler Mu’s operation was over, he let Butler Mu consume them.

Among these alchemical pills, Ling Han also added the 600-year-old yellow ginseng. This was a great supplement, and was most beneficial to Butler Mu’s injuries.

If it was an ordinary person, Ling Han would not dare to use such a powerful medicine, fearing that he would not be able to bear the nourishment.

But Butler Mu was an Extreme Bone Tier elite, so he could completely withstand it.

Just like that, after more than ten days, a warship landed in Jining City. City Lord Yu Yi personally brought the envoy from the capital over.

“Ruoxian, you came to Jining City, but you didn’t come to my house. Do you not consider me as your uncle?” Yu Yi said as soon as he entered.
