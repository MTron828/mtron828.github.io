Chapter 764: The Imperial Prestige Cannot Be Challenged

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xianyu Cheng only felt it funny that a human ant in the Deity Transformation Tier spoke threats in front of him—truly an enormous joke.

To be honest, Xianyu Dongming had indeed gone too far, but so what?

Should he give face to a mere lowly human?

It was just like you picking out a chicken for slaughter—would you need to look at the expressions of the other chickens inside the chicken pen?

Doing as he pleased, without scruples.

It seemed this human still didn’t know the power of his, and even began to make a show of authority.

“Human, are you tired of living?” He spread his own aura, which seethed inside the imperial palace like boiling water, making everyone groan and find it difficult to bear as their body and spirit were about to break into pieces.

Here, there wasn’t a lack of kings among martial artists who could withstand an elite’s pressure, but now it was different. Xianyu Cheng deliberately did so with Origin Power attached to the aura. It was no longer the problem of aura, but that of real oppressive power.

Who could withstand it?

Ling Han, however, was unafraid, and said coldly, “I respect you guys as guests, but you guys instead reverse the roles and direct me to do this and that as you please. Not just that, you even threaten me and threaten my courtiers! Do you guys know who I am?

“I am Great Ling Empire’s emperor, and the imperial prestige and authority can’t be challenged. Today, I’ll take you guys as sacrifices for divine blessing, then march westward!” he said loudly, stirring the officials of all ranks who fell all over the ground.

‘This is our emperor!’

“Long live the emperor!” All the officials barely opened their mouths and bowed.

“Long live the emperor!” The soldiers in the distant heard and also followed suit, bowing down. This was like a ripple that spread throughout the imperial city—even the common people knelt down, shouting loudly, ‘long live the emperor.’

The decisions Ling Han made these days benefited the country and the people, winning the hearts of and minds of the people, and now the people reciprocated with their hearts.

Passionate cries spread throughout the entire imperial city as the people’s minds aligned. The power of the nation was available to use, and Ling Han’s body immediately glowed with golden light—it was a voluntary blessing of the power of the nation.

Xianyu Cheng couldn’t help but sneer, and said threateningly, “How dare you defy the heavenly law, establishing a nation and aggregating fortune!” Being an emperor was the dream of many people, which wasn’t strange, but establishing a country and then aggregating the power of the nation... this was something that many great forces definitely couldn’t allow.

... In reality, many large forces didn’t know why it wasn’t allowed. It was the rule passed down from their distant ancestors generation after generation—death to violators!

It had to be said that the five ancient sects’ brainwashing was quite successful, and so was the sea race’s.

“Fourth Uncle, cut the crap with him, just kill him. How about I be the emperor for a few days as entertainment!” Xianyu Dongming said while eating fruits, spitting the peels and pits randomly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xianyu Cheng thought about it, but said, “I’ll spare his life for the time being; finding that b*tch is more important!”

Speaking of that b*tch, Xianyu Dongming was instantly worked up, his eyes even turning red. He was Xianyu Family’s genius, spoiled from the moment of his birth, getting whatever he wanted.

However, Helian Xun Xue made him a cuckold, which was an equivalent of giving him a loud and clear slap, making him the joke of the north sea all of a sudden—even the royal families of the other sea regions heard of it.

If Helian Xun Xue wasn’t executed in public, would he still have the face to see other people in the future?

Helian Xun Xue hinted at Ling Han with her eyes, meaning to have him endure silently for a little longer. The north region’s royal family was too powerful, possessing over thirty Shattering Void Tier elites, and not to mention dispatching them all, even if one came, how would Great Ling Empire resist? With their lives!

Ling Han, however, laughed loudly, and said, “To some people, one can’t yield—the more you’re bearing it silently, the more they think that we’re easy to bully! These two people... today, I’m definitely killing them!”

Xiu , he charged towards Xianyu Dongming.

“What a joke, trying to commit murder in front of me?” Xianyu Cheng sneered. He was a high-level Heaven Tier elite, an almost invincible being beneath the Shattering Void Tier. He immediately cross Ling Han’s path to block him.

However, at this moment, a flash of lightning flickered by Ling Han’s body, and with a zi , his figure suddenly accelerated and instantly disappeared before Xianyu Cheng.

So fast! Xianyu Cheng cried out inwardly—how could he be so fast, was this guy really in the Deity Transformation Tier? Sh*t!

he immediately said inwardly, turning abruptly, and his expression instantly changed drastically. As expected, Xianyu Dongming fell into Ling Han’s hands.

It was too shocking. Xianyu Dongming was at peak stage of the Deity Transformation Tier, higher in tier than Ling Han, so how was he restrained with one move?

This human was... too out of the ordinary.

“Bastard, let go of me!” Xianyu Dongming shouted as he struggled. Earlier, he hadn’t been on guard at all; first, he’d never thought that Ling’s strength would be so impressive, and second, he’d never expected that Ling Han could charge over with Xianyu Cheng blocking his way.

In a hurry, he only had time to raise his hand, and ended up being restrained by Ling Han.

However, he wasn’t afraid, for he was Xianyu Family’s genius, the jewel on the imperial crown. Did a mere lowly human dare hurt him? Wasn’t he afraid of the sea race’s elites being dispatched, trampling over this small imperial court?

He was furious, and once he regained freedom, he would definitely step on Ling Han’s head fiercely and make Ling Han suffer his fill of humiliation, then he’d cut off Ling Han’s head to use as a wine bowl in the future.

“Let him go now!” Xianyu Cheng also shouted. He was afraid that Ling Han would do something crazy under a violent rage.

... Ten thousand Ling Hans together couldn’t compare to a single finger on Xianyu Dongming—there was no way to even think of mutual destruction.

Ling Han sneered, and Origin Power burst forth within his right hand and invaded Xianyu Dongming’s body. He said, “Let go of your sister. This Emperor has already said, those who challenge my imperial prestige, no matter who, will all be killed!”

“Ah...” Xianyu Dongming screamed, for he discovered his own martial intent being obliterated!

Ling Han was simply going to cripple him!

However, it was too terrifying—Ling Han’s cultivation was clearly inferior to his, so why could Ling Han obliterate his martial intent? It was the crushing suppression of someone one tier higher!

“Die!” Xianyu Cheng’s eyes were red. If he let Ling Han cripple Xianyu Dongming, he’d also be punished when he returned to the family, and would be better off dead! He had to intervene, for Xianyu Dongming was Xianyu Family’s most outstanding descendant.

Ling Han shook his right hand, and ka, ka, ka , the bones in Xianyu Dongming’s entire body crackled, all being shattered into pieces—Xianyu Dongming became a disabled person. He offhandedly threw Xianyu Dongming to the side and greeted Xianyu Cheng.

“Damn it! Damn it!” Xianyu Cheng’s killing intent seethed. Although Xianyu Donming hadn’t died, his entire body was soft like dough, all the bones apparently broken, and the martial intent on his body nearly disappeared. It would be a great injury even if cured with spirit medicine, and he’d even lose all potential and die as a mediocre person.

He couldn’t shirk the responsibility, and thinking about the punishment he might suffer, he was obviously driven mad.

Kill this human! Kill, kill, kill!

Ling Han and Xianyu Cheng exchanged blows head on. Peng , the imperial palace was immediately blown up, but Ling Han also brought Xianyu Cheng into the sky. The opponent could attack without scruples here, but Ling Han couldn’t.

His physique was too tough, and risking being struck head on a few times, he still remained unmoved.

“Damned human! Not only will I have you die today, the entire empire will be buried with you!” Xianyu Cheng said balefully.
