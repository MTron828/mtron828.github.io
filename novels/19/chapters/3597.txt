Chapter 3598: Heading to the Moonlight Planet

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Seeing that Princess Bixiao’s jade-like neck was completely red, Ling Han knew that the little loli must have been right. This princess of the Demon Race was presently wearing red undergarments.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Who would’ve thought? This princess of the Demon Race looked pure on the outside, but actually had a very wild side to her.

“Do you have anything to say?” Princess Bixiao looked over, and asked coldly. “Cough!” Ling Han hurriedly changed the topic to avoid being killed to keep the secret, and said to the little loli, “Then how can I get hold of this Five Elements Karmic Pill?”

“Simple, pluck the Five Elements Crystals, and then concoct the alchemical pill.” The little girl spread out her hands.

That simple?

Ling Han didn’t believe her, and asked again, “Then how do I harvest the Five

Elements Crystals?”

“Go to the place where the power of the Five Elements is most concentrated. Many planets have that,” the little loli said carelessly. She paused, as if thinking about something, then said, “The closest place to here, and one that fits the conditions, is the Moonlight Planet.”

“Moonlight Planet!” Ling Han was instantly startled.

The Moonlight Planet… was the planet where the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire was located. It was also a great planet, capable of nurturing Venerate Tiers of the fourth level.

The power of the Five Elements was dense there, and could form the Five Elements Crystals. This was not beyond Ling Han’s expectations. However, he was only a mere Enlightenment Tier, so how could he possibly traverse the boundless universe and head to another planet?

“Lend me your shuttle.” He immediately turned his attention to the little loll. “All right, who asked you to be the Handsome Brother that I like!” The little loll agreed immediately.

Ling Han investigated in detail, and couldn’t help but frown.

On a great planet like the Moonlight Planet the power of the Five Elements was incredibly dense, and would evolve into such places of great power of heaven and earth as Extreme Flames, Extreme Coldness, Extreme Metal, and so on. For example, in a land of Extreme Flames, the flames would take various forms, and attack those who entered. Killing them would allow one to obtain a sliver of the essence of Fire.

Countless essences of fire gathered together could turn into Fire Element Crystal.

In a similar manner, the Crystals of the Five Elements were all obtained in this manner. After they were gathered, one would be able to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill.

The problem was that the amount of essence of fire needed to condense into a Fire Element Crystal was astonishingly large.

Ordinarily, after killing for a hundred years, they should be able to gather a single Fire Element Crystal. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, how long would it take to gather all five types of Element Crystal?

Five hundred years!

How many years could a Mystery Realm Tier live? It was only around five hundred years or so, and all of this would be used to collect the Five Elements Crystals. Even if the Five Elements Karmic Pill was concocted, so what?

Even if he hadn’t died, his lifespan had already dried up, and his vitality had already fallen to rock bottom. Yet, he was still going to forcibly break through the shackles in his body?

They would only be seeking death.

However, it was not that there was no way to deal with it. A powerful force could send out a great many people to enter at the same time, and gather the essence of flames together, for example. Finally, one person would be given the Element Crystal, and the time would be endlessly shortened.

However, whether it was the essence of fire or the essence of other Five Elements, they couldn’t be brought out. Otherwise, they would immediately disappear, and could only be brought out after the Element Crystal had been condensed.

This made the Five Elements Crystals even rarer and more valuable.

In theory, the Five Elements Crystals could be sold, but usually, no one would do such a thing. The price paid was really too high.

“Generally speaking, only great sects and forces would use innumerable people to nurture their heirs. They would either be Holy Daughter or Dao Child,” the little loli concluded.

“However, for someone who is born with a Divine Physique like me, I was born without a single shackle, so there was no need to go to so much trouble. I am just that perfect,” she said very narcissistically.

Ling Han was surprised. This little loli was actually a natural Divine Physique?

Tsk, the heavens really was blind.

He immediately decided to head to the Moonlight Planet.

“Er, Bixiao, I’ll leave the Foreign Affairs Department to you.

The Demon Race princess couldn’t help but feel helpless but depressed. Who exactly was the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department? You just came back not long ago, and now you want to leave. Do I owe it to you?

But in the end, she only nodded, “You have to be careful. Don’t cause any trouble.”

The Moonlight Planet was not here. It was a great planet that had matured in martial arts, and the number of prodigies definitely far surpassed this place.

Ling Han could be considered invincible among his peers here, but it was hard to say this if he was there.

After returning to the Foreign Affairs Department, Ling Han began to actively prepare. He would bring the babies over to help him gather the essence of the Five Elements, greatly saving him time. Otherwise, if he really came back after several dozen years or even a hundred years, who knew what would have changed.

He firmly believed in his own strength. Others needed a hundred years, but he might only need ten years, and added with the help of the babies, this time could be even shorter.

Coincidentally, he could also cultivate there and push his cultivation level to the limit of Mystery Realm Tier. When he advanced into Celestial Path, he could come back. At that time, he’d go and fight with Hong Tianbu, forever resolving this long-time problem.

“Take a seat!” The little loli took out the shuttle. Actually, it could only seat one person, but who asked her to be so small? There was no problem for her to squeeze in with Ling Han.

Xiu, the shuttle immediately turned into a streak of light, shooting rapidly into the skies.

Ling Han turned around to look, and the Imperial Capital instantly shrunk to a tiny dot.

He would come back, just wait.

The shuttle soon entered into the galaxy. Meanwhile, the little loli flipped through the optical computer, muttering to herself, “Hmm, where’s the spatial node to the Moonlight Planet?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. Can you do it or not? “Found it!” The little loli clapped her hands and said with a smile. Controlling the shuttle, in the dark universe, time seemed to have lost its meaning, and nothing changed eternally.

But all of a sudden, Ling Han felt a strong pulling sensation. His vision darkened, and he saw that the shuttle had already appeared in another galaxy. It was definitely not the original space. Ling Han could make a judgement from the stars that were glowing in the distance; this space was many times larger. Furthermore, there were multiple bursts of blue flames surging, and vast and mighty energy was surging.

“Charge!” the little loli shouted in excitement. She steered the shuttle and rammed it around. Wherever there was a meteorite belt, she would crash into it. It was as if she feared that the shuttle would not be damaged.

“Hahaha!” She laughed, very pleased.

“Little girl, hurry up and find the next node,” Ling Han hurriedly shouted.

“Oh.” The little loli nodded, looking very reluctant.

Spatial nodes were extremely unique places in the universe. One could quickly jump from one node to another, thereby saving a great amount of time. However, nodes could not be traversed just because one wanted to, but rather had to reach an extremely high speed when passing through them.

Different nodes required different speeds of transmigration, but usually, the higher the speed needed, the greater the distance one could traverse. The speed of this shuttle had reached the level of Sect Master. Thus, from Celestial Sea Planet to Moonlight Planet, it only took a short two months. What made Ling Han depressed was that he had no way to cultivate in these two months, because he was completely unable to absorb the power of heaven and earth, and the Essence Nurturing Gourd was also unable to convert energy to nourish the spirit. In short, the galaxy was definitely the most barren place. Two months later, the shuttle crashed into the atmosphere of the Moonlight Planet, and instantly began burning fiercely, turning into a ball of fire.
