Chapter 1409 Large-scale Invasion

The three Majestic Empires had many bordering territories, and thus battles and skirmishes along these shared borders were common and frequent. In fact, skirmishes would break out yearly, even monthly. However, most of these skirmishes were only small-scale conflicts, where only cultivators below the Immortal level participated.

However, this time was different. Completely different.

Both Majestic Empires were led by a Heavenly Body Tier great elite as they charged into the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. In just three days, they had already seized a large chunk of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire’s land. However, their assault wasn’t over yet, and they continued to march toward the Imperial Capital.

By the looks of it, the two Majestic Empires were determined to take the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire down in one breath. That way, the Joint Peace Planet would return to its previous state of two dominant Majestic Empires again.

Indeed, this was a very good opportunity. Empress Luan Xing and the Nine Kings were all cultivating in seclusion at this moment, and the only remaining elites of the Majestic Empire were the two ministers, the Seven Generals, and Qu Qiuxue. In fact, there were only six generals now.

In any case, the fact that the two Majestic Empires had only launched an assault now also showed that they were apprehensive of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. Were Empress Luan Xing and the Nine Kings truly cultivating in seclusion?

30 years had passed, and they were finally unable to contain themselves any longer. They resolutely decided to launch an all-out assault.

As long as they conquered the entire Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, Empress Luan Xing wouldn’t be able to draw on the power of the nation even if she exited seclusion. Meanwhile, it would be a completely different story for the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor. As their territory grew, they would eventually go from intruders to owners!

Ling Han immediately ordered everyone to prepare in the hopes of challenging their enemies. However, only three days had passed when he received the newest battle report.

The two Majestic Empires had increased the scale of their assault. Instead of one Heavenly Body Tier elite leading one army, there were now 10 Heavenly Body Tier elites leading 10 armies. Moreover, it was rumored that the two emperors were personally leading their troops now.

Upon receiving this news, Ling Han immediately dispelled any thoughts of leading an army to meet these enemies. Instead, he decided to act alone.

After all, the military might of the Great Ling Empire was utterly insignificant compared to the military might of the two Majestic Empires. Once these two juggernauts revealed their true strength, they would possess a crushing advantage over any army that the Great Ling Empire could muster.

If the enemy only consisted of one army, Ling Han could have defeated them simply by slaying their Heavenly Body Tier general. The remaining enemies would all be insignificant pawns—he could easily defeat them by unleashing heaven’s might.

Now, however, the two emperors were personally leading their troops.

Although Ling Han had belief in himself, his current battle prowess was only capable of suppressing those at the early stage of the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. However, the two emperors were not only at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, but they were even four-star geniuses!

Wherever their army reached was wherever their territory would expand to. Coupled with the power of the nation, how could Ling Han hope to challenge them?

Thus, Ling Han’s aim was no longer to defeat and expel the invaders. Instead, his aim was merely to protect Empress Luan Xing—he would bring her into the Black Tower and take her away.

Once she completed her breakthrough, she would possess battle prowess at the pinnacle level. At that time, she would be the most powerful person on Joint Peace Planet, and perhaps in the entire galaxy. Even if the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor teamed up, their only fate would be defeat at the hands of the empress. Now, however, Ling Han could only escape from their might.

Ling Han had a discussion with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others, eventually deciding that they should remain to guard the Great Ling Empire. His aim was to sneak someone out, so there was no need for an entire troop of them to head over. In any case, the others wouldn’t be able to help him anyway.

Although the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others were reluctant, they had no choice but to nod in agreement. Even if they went, they could only sit inside the Black Tower as spectators.

There was no time to dawdle, and Ling Han immediately set off.

His speed was godly, and it wasn’t long before he entered the territory of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. As he ventured deeper and deeper into the Majestic Empire, he also received more and more information on the current situation of the war. The two invading Majestic Empires were advancing at an astonishing speed, seizing almost half of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire in just a few days’ time.

Meanwhile, the Left and Right Ministers along with the Six Generals responded by pulling back troops and retreating to the Imperial Capital.

This was a wise decision. After all, which of them could challenge the two emperors, even if they fought with no regard for their life? However, it was also because of this decision that the territory of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire shrunk even more rapidly.

Right now, all of the troops were defending the Imperial Capital. There was also a large formation protecting the Imperial Capital, and this large formation was controlled by the nine Heavenly Body Tier elites. This formation was so powerful that perhaps even the two emperors couldn’t breach its defenses.

Several days passed, and Ling Han finally arrived before the Imperial Capital.

“Please open the formation and let me in!” Ling Han shouted toward the top of the city wall.

Ling Han was undoubtedly a bringer of misfortune. How many Heavenly Body Tier elites had Joint Peace Planet possessed? Yet, 20 years ago, he had killed several of them as if he were merely chopping up vegetables. As such, it was only natural that he was renowned as a ruthless elite. Thus, the guards on the city wall quickly reported his arrival. It wasn’t long before four Heavenly Body Tier elites appeared atop the city wall.

Qu Qiuxue, the Left and Right Ministers, and... Sha Jing.

“The enemy troops might be upon us at any moment, so what if this person is a spy for the enemy empires?” Sha Jing asked. “If we open the formation, and this person attacks us from inside, what will we do then?”

‘F*cking hell, how can I possibly be a spy? The empress is my wife!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

However, his relationship with Empress Luan Xing was a private affair between the two of them. This was something that no one else was aware of. After all, their relationship also involved the secret of the Nine Snake Tribe.

However, Sha Jing’s words weren’t complete slander, either. What if Ling Han really was a spy? If they took one wrong step at this critical moment, it was very likely that they would suffer a resounding defeat!

Right now, their only chance of turning the tables was if Empress Luan Xing successfully advanced to the pinnacle level and exited seclusion. If she did so, she would definitely be more powerful than before. Moreover, she had already been capable of battling against the two emperors before, so she would definitely possess a crushing advantage if she were to successfully advance to the pinnacle level.

This was the sliver of hope that everyone held, and the reason that they were determined to defend the Imperial Capital at all costs. They definitely couldn’t make any blunder, no matter how small or insignificant it seemed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Right now, even Qu Qiuxue was wearing a solemn expression. After all, Ling Han was only the ruler of a vassal state. Could she truly guarantee his loyalty? Moreover, Ling Han was far too powerful. If he were insistent on causing trouble, who could stop him?

“Ling Han, are you here to provide help?” she asked.

“Correct!” Ling Han replied with a nod.

“With us elites standing guard, we can guarantee that the Imperial Capital won’t fall,” Qu Qiuxue said. “You can scout the surroundings and bring us some intelligence. When Her Majesty exits seclusion, you’ll naturally be rewarded for your work.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle bitterly. He was being doubted even though he was coming to help his own wife! What in the world?!

However, regardless of how he tried to explain himself, Qu Qiuxue and the others remained steadfast in refusing his entry into the Imperial Capital.

Right now, stability was their key strategy. They definitely couldn’t afford any slip-ups.

While trying to convince them, Ling Han had even considered barging his way into the Imperial Capital. However, whether or not he could breach the formation was a problem. Moreover, what if the two Majestic Empires coincidentally arrived just as he breached the formation? At that time, he would have genuinely become a spy for the enemy empires.

Anyhow, since these elites were so confident that the formation could hold back the two emperors, Ling Han could only choose to believe them. He sat down on some mountain in the distance, ready to act once the armies of the two Majestic Empire arrived below the city walls or even breached them.

That was about his wife, so he would rescue her no matter what.

The days crept by, and after just half a month, a sea of banners and flags appeared on the horizon, mighty and overbearing.

The two Majestic Empires had already seized all of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire’s territory, bar the Imperial Capital. Their troops were now at the foot of the Imperial Capital’s walls, the might that they exuded formidable and exuberant. Meanwhile, the totem above the Imperial Capital had already become as dim as could be.

An empire’s territory, population, and overall strength were all factors in determining the power of the nation.

“Those who submit will live, and those who resist shall perish!” the Eternity Sky Emperor announced. He was dressed in a suit of golden armor, and his severed arm had already regrown. He was radiating with might, and he continued, “Make haste and open the city gates! Otherwise, you shall all perish with this city!”
