Chapter 2069: Might

Peng!

With a single punch from Ling Han, the black figure was instantly smashed into pieces. However, to his surprise, the black figure started to rapidly regather and reform. It then swung its long arm, striking at his back.

‘Are these black figures… undying monsters?’

Ling Han leaped to the side, dodging this attack.

Meanwhile, he started to analyze the situation in his mind. The battle prowess of these black figures was at Earth Soul. Although they couldn’t rival supreme monarch tiers such as Tian Qingyue, or even ordinary monarch tiers such as Du Shaojun, they still posed a huge threat to those with a battle prowess under the level of Earth Soul.

This was because they couldn’t be destroyed.

“Aaah!” Agonized screams started to resound through the air. These were the screams of people who had underestimated the danger posed by the black figures. They had thought that they could destroy them with a single strike. In the end, however, they had ended up being killed instead.

Ling Han immediately adjusted his opinion of the black figures. They were undying Earth Soul beings, so they would pose a huge threat even to Heaven Soul cultivators.

Just then, he had witnessed several Heaven Soul elites being killed with a single strike.

Most importantly, there was an exorbitant number of these black figures. More than 1000 of them had charged out in unison, and most of them had charged toward Tian Qingyue and the others.

Why?

This was because they had an advantage in numbers! Thus, they were naturally the bigger target.

In reality, these black figures were extremely fair. In terms of ratio, the number of black figures attacking Ling Han and the others was the same as the number of black figures attacking Tian Qingyue and the others. They all had to face around six black figures.

However, on Ling Han’s side, they were all extremely powerful prodigies. Even Bewitching Maiden Rou could crush Yin Soul cultivators, so she could still manage to hang on against the Earth Soul black figures. As long as Ling Han looked out for her, she could naturally hold her own against these opponents.

In an instant, a dozen or so members of Tian Qingyue’s team had already been killed. Moreover, this number was still steadily rising.

It was no wonder that the elders had said that those who were more powerful wouldn’t necessarily win. Truly, the destructive ability of these black figures was quite remarkable. Even as powerful as Tian Qingyue and the others were, it was still hard to say whether they could survive the relentless attacks of these freaks for 10 entire days.

These black figures didn’t experience fatigue, didn’t experience pain, and didn’t even die. Were such opponents not terrifying?

“Hurry, enter the defensive formation!” Tian Qingyue and the other monarch tiers hurriedly exclaimed. This was their best choice at the moment.

“One group rest, and the other group take responsibility for maintaining the defenses. We’ll rotate after a while.”

“We need to battle for 10 days, so everyone obey the commands… otherwise it’s your own life on the line!”

Those who possessed battle prowess above Earth Soul stepped forward to attack, easily shattering the black figures. However, these black figures continued to regather, and they were simply impossible to destroy. This posed a huge threat to their defenses.

Fortunately, they had Tian Qingyue and the other monarch tiers to help them. With their help, their mortality rate instantly decreased. At the very least, no one was dying at this moment.

Meanwhile, Ji Wuming chuckled coldly as he charged forward.

Peng, peng, peng!

One after another, several black figures were easily smashed apart. Ji Wuming then charged at Tian Qingyue and the others, drawing his Severed Passion Sword without hesitation as he did so. With a slash, powerful Sword Qi soared into the sky. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Humph!” Tian Qingyue and Xia Houtong immediately stepped forward to block his strike. They each launched a powerful and domineering punch.

Peng!

Ji Wuming was instantly sent stumbling back. Even though his Severed Passion Sword was indestructible, what use would it be if it couldn’t strike its target?

After all, Tian Qingyue and the other monarch tiers still possessed a stronger battle prowess. Thus, the result of this exchange was decided by their cultivation level.

However, Ji Wuming didn’t care about this. He continued to dance around, with his Severed Passion Sword slashing down again and again.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Bursts of Sword Qi sliced through the air, surging toward his enemies.

His goal was extremely evident. He wanted to disperse these peoples’ defenses. The true killer wouldn’t be him, but rather the black figures.

“Detestable!” Tian Qingyue roared in fury. By teaming up with Xia Houtong, he could completely suppress the might of Ji Wuming’s attacks. He could send Ji Wuming flying before he had even neared them. However, they were only two people, so how could they block all of Ji Wuming’s chaotic attacks?

His attacks were extremely random and chaotic.

In order to dodge his attacks, the other cultivators had no option but to disperse. By doing so, however, their defensive formation was immediately rendered useless. The black figures surged forward, instantly ripping several people to shreds. Blood sprayed through the air, and this was an extremely gruesome sight.

“Don’t disperse! Don’t disperse!” some of the cultivators hurriedly exclaimed.

Upon seeing the fate awaiting those who dispersed, the fleeing cultivators immediately ran back, reforming the defensive formation.

A smile spread across Ji Wuming’s face, and he immediately slashed down with his Severed Passion Sword again. A burst of Sword Qi that measured nine meters tall and two meters wide immediately surged forth.

However, the cultivators gritted their teeth and refused to flee.

Boom!

The burst of Sword Qi swept over, instantly causing blood to spray through the sky. At least a dozen or so people were directly crushed to death.

After all, this was a Celestial Tool!

If its might were truly unleashed, even Ascending Origin Tier elites would be killed in an instant. Right now, only a portion of its power was being unleashed. Even so, it was still utterly terrifying. Was this something that Dividing Soul Tier cultivators could block?

Everyone was transfixed with shock. So… should they dodge or not?

Either way, their fate would still be death!

“Attack him together!” Zhu Huiyun cried. She immediately charged over.

They had purposefully kicked Ling Han and Ji Wuming out of the alliance, and they had then angered them into signing a contract with a different tribe. Was their aim not to crush their opponent through advantage in numbers?

Now, however, their advantage in number wasn’t helping them at all. Facing the wave of black figures, they could only suffer a beating.

If this continued, they would definitely collapse.

Thus, while they were still great in number, they would work together to dispose of Ji Wuming and Ling Han. As long as one of them was killed, Tian Qingyue and the others simply needed to ensure their own safety until the end of the battle. That way, victory would ultimately belong to them.

“Die!”

The other cultivators were also burning with fury. They were either going to be killed by the black figures or Ji Wuming, so they might as well unleash their full power and take a gamble. If they succeeded in killing Ji Wuming, their perilous situation would naturally be alleviated.

Their thirst for life allowed them to unleash an astonishing battle prowess. One after another, numerous treasures were summoned without hesitation. There were also decrees, and these were the simplest of treasures.

At this moment, the sky was drowned out by celestial light. The might of these cultivators’ attacks was simply astounding.

Meanwhile, the four supreme monarch tiers also joined hands to attack Ji Wuming. As for the black figures, they were left to the other few monarch tiers. In addition to them, a dozen or so Heaven Soul cultivators were also battling against the black figures. Right now, they were all working together to kill Ji Wuming.

“Have you forgotten about me?” Ling Han roared. He unleashed his Nine Heavens Flame divided soul, and he furiously charged forward with Divine Demon Sword in hand.

Peng, peng, peng!

Like a lion charging into a flock of sheep, he instantly sent everyone around him flying. Some of them were in one piece, while some of them had already been reduced into shattered flesh and blood.

“We can’t allow them to work together!” Zhu Huiyun shrieked.

Not only had the four monarch tiers witnessed the combined power of Ling Han and Ji Wuming before, but they had even faced their insurmountable might.

One of them possessed unparalleled defenses, while the other possessed unrivaled attacks. If they teamed up, they could easily destroy everyone at the same cultivation level.

Tian Qingyue and Xia Houtong immediately summoned four divided souls each, sending them over to block Ling Han.

With them using eight divided souls to attack Ling Han, it was clear that they held him in extremely high regard.

“Heh!” Without any hesitation, Ling Han immediately unleashed a Great Clash of Source Powers.

Peng, peng, peng!

The eight divided souls were all sent flying.

They were nowhere near as powerful as their owners!

If one wanted their divided souls to be as powerful as themselves, they would need to absorb Celestial King Tier divided souls while they were dividing their souls. For example, absorbing a Source Power of heaven and earth. Otherwise, they would need to be like Ji Wuming. That was, they needed to be a Celestial King in their past life.

If they couldn’t achieve this, it was simply impossible for their divided souls to be as powerful as themself.
