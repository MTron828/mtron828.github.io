2807 Leaving

Ling Han started to make preparations, and drew all the people of Ling City into the Celestial Guest Residence one by one.

Having gone through hardships together, Ling Han fully trusted the people who had stayed behind. Of course it was impossible for him to abandon and leave them to their own devices.

Now that he had a lot of Divine Metal on hand, he was completely able to create more Celestial Guest Residences. He even had a feeling that when the Powers of Dimensions in his body developed to a certain level, he would even be able to produce Spiritual Herbs and Divine Metals by himself!

Of course, he was still a very long way from this step. Perhaps he had to wait until he advanced to the Seventh Tier.

This time, Ling Han had another purpose for leaving.

To acquire at least two pieces of Devouring Metal.

Divine Metal was worthless to him now, but if he wanted to forge a Heavenly Venerate Tool, he could only do it by using Devouring Metal. Although the Flaming Frost Realm was huge, there was also a large number of Heavenly Venerates. Therefore, it was really too difficult to obtain Devouring Metal.

Hence, looking for it in other dimensions ought to reap some harvest.

After putting everyone into the Spatial Celestial Tool, Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. Now, he didn’t care whoever might come looking for him. As long as he could traverse the dimensions, could he be stopped even by a Seventh Tier?

Ling Han had no idea, because he had never met the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate before, so he was unaware of the kind of strength that was actually attained by a Seventh Tier.

“Ling Han!”

Zhang Kailun came to challenge him again.

Ling Han leapt out of the city. He was going to have a final battle with Zhang Kailun, and then he would leave. The Genesis World was so big that he could roam about freely as he wished.

“Kindly leave this battle to me.” A faint voice was heard as a young man in black robes suddenly appeared.

When Zhang Kailun saw him, he couldn’t help his eyes narrowing slightly. “Lord Saintly Origin!”

This was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Was he intending to challenge Ling Han as well?

The Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin looked at Ling Han. “Are you going to hand over the Heavenly Venerable Seal yourself, or do I have to refine you to get it?”

The Heavenly Venerable Seals could be passed on, but not taught to another. He could choose to part with it by severing a part of his consciousness, and in order to endure the weight of the Heavenly Venerable Seal, it could only be done once. Once severed, he would no longer possess it; furthermore, this would cause huge damage to himself. It would be impossible to do so if he was not a top-grade elite.

For example, Zhou Heng could part with the Heavenly Venerable Seal, and passed it on to black donkey naturally because Zhou Heng had already advanced to the Sixth Tier, with a consciousness so vast that he could afford to lose a portion of it, but Ling Han was only a First Tier, so he absolutely couldn’t afford to lose it.

But refining it would be even more cruel as one’s life would be lost in the process.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “Do I know you?”

“Probably not.” The Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin shook his head with a smile.

“Have I offended you before?” Ling Han asked again.

Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin still shook his head. “Prior to this, we have never met.”

“Did I kill your son, grandson, and his descendants?” Ling Han asked for the third time.

Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin seemed to have a surprisingly good temperament. He continued to shake his head. “No.”

“Then you just casually barge into my house to ask me for the Heavenly Venerable Seal? Did I owe you anything?” Ling Han suddenly exploded angrily. “You’re so old, so have you wasted all your life to be so stupid?”

The smile on the Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin’s face immediately froze. He had been observing Ling Han. From the details of the other party’s expression, he was sure that Ling Han didn’t have any trump card left. He didn’t expect Ling Han to suddenly explode with anger, and directly shower him with insults.

This brat!

He stared at Ling Han fiercely, his killing intent already rising.

“Brother Saintly Origin, how about leaving this battle to me?” With a long laugh, Zhuang Feirui appeared with a look of arrogance on his face. Although he addressed Saintly Origin as a brother, he actually had no respect for him.

Although he had just advanced to the Fourth Tier, he had cultivated too powerfully when he had been a First Tier, and his battle prowess was already at the peak of Fourth Tier, so he was absolutely not afraid of the Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin.

Zhang Kailun was taken aback again. Of course he recognized Zhuang Feirui. Back then, they could just barely be considered as belonging to the same generation.

Hadn’t this guy already died a long time ago? Why did he suddenly pop up? Furthermore, how had he already advanced to the Fourth Tier?

“Hehe, I would also like to join in the fun.” Another elite appeared, also at the Fourth Tier. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I am not willing to be left alone.” The fourth Heavenly Venerate appeared, also another Fourth Tier.

More and more Heavenly Venerates appeared. They were originally just observing from the surroundings, but now they all popped up.

It couldn’t be helped. If one was a step slower, Ling Han would be taken away by someone, and the Heavenly Venerable Seal would be extracted from him. It would be too difficult to snatch the Heavenly Venerable Seal from an elite of the same level.

Except for a supreme freak like Zhuang Feirui, most of the Heavenly Venerates’ battle prowess at the same level was similar. It would just depend on who could obtain more and stronger Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Zhang Kailun gritted his teeth. What was going on?

Not only Fourth Tier, but there were also many Third Tier Heavenly Venerates who came. However, they were not qualified to come close, so they could only wait for an opportunity in the distance. What if Ling Han was severely wounded and sent flying to them?

Ling Han saw Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and a murderous look flashed in his eyes. However, it was too difficult for him to break out of the siege created by Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates and kill a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

…Unless he had advanced to the Second Tier.

Oh well, it wasn’t necessary to rush to kill someone.

Ling Han looked at the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates surrounding him. He couldn’t handle even one, let alone a dozen or so of them. However, he still had a trump card up his sleeve, so naturally he was completely unfazed, and said, “There’s so many of you, being Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, to bully me who’s alone—how very impressive.”

These words were full of sarcasm, which made those Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates feel embarrassed, as seen on their facial expressions.

It had to be known that Ling Han was only a First Tier. Even one Fourth Tier would have been too much, not to mention that there were so many Fourth Tiers being dispatched.

They couldn’t refute his words.

“There’s no point talking rubbish to a junior; take him down first and then talk later.” A Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was heard saying.

Ling Han stared at him, nodded, and said, “I will remember you, and will definitely pay you a visit in the future!”

The Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t help his expression turning dark. Ling Han actually dared to threaten him. Did he think he would be able to narrowly escape this time?

“I am White Flame, you would do well to remember it,” he said lightly.

“Take him down first.” All the Heavenly Venerates reached a consensus. Once they took Ling Han down, they would decide who could get this Heavenly Venerable Seal. Otherwise, what was the point in them fighting and killing each other over it?

“Good!” The others also agreed.

...

Zhang Kailun retreated into the distance; this kind of battle was beyond his control. A thought flashed in his mind, and he immediately ran towards the city. Ling Han was doomed, so he wanted to take Hu Niu back to his master.

“Junior Sister! Junior Sister!” He entered the city, but immediately found that there was no one in the city.

It was empty, and there wasn’t even a single person there.

This was an empty city.

Zhang Kailun immediately flew out of the city, and said loudly, “Ling Han, where have you hidden my junior sister?”

Previously, Ling Han had used certain means to deceive the world, making people think that the city was still the same as before.

“Hmm?” The expressions of the Heavenly Venerates changed. With all of them being sly old foxes, they immediately thought of many things.

“Hurry up and take down this brat!” They acted immediately, not giving Ling Han a chance to use any tricks.

Ling Han showed a smile. “Everyone, I have taken note of all your voice and features. I hope that all of you live a long healthy life until I go to find you.”

Xiu, he disappeared in a flash.

“Where did he go?!” All the Heavenly Venerates were amazed and shocked because they had sealed off the space around them, and it was supposed to be absolutely impossible for Ling Han to instantly teleport himself away.

...

But, where did he go?
