2942 Leaked Secret

As Ling Han walked along, he noticed that everyone was glancing at him with strange expressions as if they were looking at a monster. In fact, some of them didn’t even try to conceal the look of disgust in their eyes.

Thank you readers!

‘F*ck! Have I offended you or something?’

Ling Han and the Empress weren’t too affected by this, but Hu Niu directly glared back at them. What, did they think that she didn’t know how to glare?

“Boss!”

“Ling Han!”

!!

“Fourth Brother!”

Xuan Feng, Yi, the Rain Emperor, and the others all ran over, their expressions extremely solemn.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “Has the sky collapsed? Even if it has, I can help you guys hold it up!”

His battle prowess was at the Sixth Tier now, so he truly had the right to utter such words.

“Boss, something has genuinely gone wrong!” Xuan Feng hurriedly said. He paused for a moment before continuing, “I don’t know who did it, but someone exposed your relationship with Hysteria, and now news of this is spreading like wildfire.”

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han’s expression became cold and solemn.

Few people knew that he had been selected by Hysteria before. Apart from his wives, the only other people who knew were Bai Mifan, Xuan Feng, Zhou Heng, and the others. However, Ling Han was certain that none of them would leak this secret.

‘Who could it be?’

Thinking about it, it could only be the subordinates of Hysteria, such as Huangfu Dongyue.

When trying to kill someone, sometimes it wasn’t necessary to target them yourself. Borrowing the hands of another was equally effective, and it could even save some effort.

It was definitely these people who had spread the news of Ling Han’s relationship with Hysteria. Their aim was to drive a wedge between Ling Han and the others, and perhaps even cause the others to become hostile toward him and eventually try to hunt him down. At that time, Ling Han would have no allies, and he would instead end up being hunted by both sides.

Taking a step back, would Ling Han feel disheartened if he were hunted by his own allies?

Even though Ling Han knew that this was Hysteria’s scheme, he would still feel fury toward those who treated him with contempt and disdain. Would this cause him to feel disappointed in all of them?

In any case, Hysteria didn’t really care how big the wedge between Ling Han and the others became. All it needed was for Huangfu Dongyue and the others to spread some rumors. After all, this wouldn’t cost them anything.

These thoughts quickly flashed through Ling Han’s mind. He had to admit that this was an extremely ruthless and effective scheme from Hysteria.

He could guarantee that he would never take commands from Hysteria. However, how many others would trust him?

“Ling Han!” someone shouted as they flew over from the distance. He looked Ling Han up and down with a disdainful expression before saying, “The four generals are calling you over for a meeting.”

Ling Han was extremely ticked off. This person was Feng Wuding’s subordinate, and he had also come from the Genesis World of the last era. He was quite powerful, and he had already reached the Third Tier right now. This was indeed quite impressive.

However, would Ling Han be afraid of a measly Third Tier cultivator?

“I’m a commander of the coalition army, yet you dare to directly call my name? Are you trying to disrespect your superior?” Ling Han asked. His gaze was cold as he looked at the person.

Regardless of what was going to happen after this, and regardless of how they were going to resolve this situation, he definitely wouldn’t allow others to trample over his dignity.

Everyone needed to have a bottom line.

The Third Tier Heavenly Venerate hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would scold him, because he thought that Ling Han should have been extremely panicked after his relationship with Hysteria had been exposed. With that being the case, how could he have the confidence to scold him? The Third Tier Heavenly Venerate wanted to retort Ling Han, yet he couldn’t help but feel apprehensive before this Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. His courage instantly vanished without a trace.

He hesitated for a moment before clasping his hands in respect, and saying, “This subordinate doesn’t dare!”

“What’s the matter?” Ling Han asked calmly.

‘What’s the matter? Aren’t you aware already? Why are you still playing dumb?’

However, he had just been intimidated by Ling Han, so how would he dare to talk back? He could only say, “Lord, the four commanders are currently waiting for you in the meeting hall.”

“You’re finally speaking a bit like a human,” Bai Mifan said coldly. He had always disliked Feng Wuding. Moreover, he was the grandson of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, so he naturally didn’t need to choose his words carefully.

The Third Tier Heavenly Venerate wanted to glare at him, yet upon recalling that Bai Mifan was one of the greatest prodigies of all eternity, he immediately suppressed his urge. Even though Bai Mifan wasn’t as prodigious as Feng Wuding, he was still countless times more powerful than this messenger. If he dared to provoke Bai Mifan, he would almost deserve to be beaten into a cripple.

“Underlings should understand that they’re nothing more than underlings. Why are you so keen to rush to the front line? Do you want to become cannon fodder?” the Rain Emperor asked in a calm voice.

The Third Tier Heavenly Venerate didn’t dare to provoke Ling Han and the others, so he could only keep his mouth shut and endure this scolding.

In any case, there was a trial awaiting Ling Han, and he would definitely receive his punishment there. That being the case, there was indeed no need for him to rush to the front lines.

“Lord, after you,” he said as he respectfully made a gesture of invitation.

Ling Han completely ignored him. Even though he set off, it wasn’t in the direction of the meeting hall.

“Lord…!” The Third Tier Heavenly Venerate hurriedly ran over to stop him.

Peng!

The Empress lashed out with a palm strike, instantly sending the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate flying.

Crack…

He flew back, causing a long and deep pit to form in the ground.

The Empress had advanced to the Fourth Tier quite a while ago, and there was the power of 100 dimensions in her body. Even though she was unable to challenge those a tier above her now, would this extra tier of cultivation not cause her power to become overwhelming?

Ling Han paused for a brief moment, saying, “I just got back, so I need to have a rest first. Are you going to stop me?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate said. He had no option but to swallow his displeasure. He lowered his head, his eyes filled with resentment and fury,

He was at the Third Tier! He was a mighty Third Tier Heavenly Venerate who stood at the pinnacle of the world!

Ling Han smiled as he continued to walk forward.

They wanted to put him on trial? Heh, he had a clear conscience, so who had the right to try him and sentence him?

After he returned to his residence, the Rain Emperor and the others hurriedly asked him what his plan was.

“My plan?” Ling Han replied with a smile. “I’ll counter soldiers with arms, and water with an earth weir.”

“Fourth Brother, what in the world is going on?” the Rain Emperor asked. He had also heard from others that Ling Han had some kind of relationship with Hysteria.

Ling Han explained to them how he had been chosen by Hysteria, not hiding any of the details.

“So Lord Zhou and Lord Lin already know about this,” the others said, breathing a sigh of relief. Since the Sixth Tier elites already knew about this, it would definitely be very easy to resolve.

“The trial tomorrow will most likely only be for show.”

“Mm-hm, Lord Zhou and Lord Chu aren’t ordinary Sixth Tier elites. They’re only a small step away from advancing to the Seventh Tier, and this is a step that they might take at any time. Perhaps… they’ve already advanced to the Seventh Tier. Their words will definitely carry a huge weight.”

“But we still need to be careful. Some people might try to seize this opportunity to cause trouble and smear Little Han’s reputation,” the large black dog said.

“If that happens, then these people are definitely listening to the commands of Xin Qihu and Feng Wuding. Otherwise, who would dare to do that?” Bai Mifan said.

Everyone nodded in agreement. Most likely the only people who would take advantage of this situation to attack Ling Han were Xin Qihu and Feng Wuding.

A day quickly passed by. It was extremely calm, and Xin Qihu and the others didn’t send anyone over to call Ling Han. However, everyone knew that this was the calm before the storm. The quieter it was now, the more terrifying the storm would be when it arrived.

The next day, Ling Han didn’t need anyone to come over to call him. He confidently strode toward the meeting hall. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What if the others wanted to attack and smear him? Then go for it! He would take everything that they could throw at him.

When he arrived at the meeting hall, he saw that there were already many people gathered around. Meanwhile, Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and the others were sitting high up on the platform.

The show was about to begin.
