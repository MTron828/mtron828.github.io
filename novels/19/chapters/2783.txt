Ling Han returned to the path from which he came.

He had followed the river flow, and appeared at the mouth at mid-mountain only a few days later.

When they saw Ling Han appear, it was natural that there would be a new wave of whispering again.

“Had he fled because he could no longer hold up?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“However, he lasted for over a year inside. This is no ordinary feat.”

“Hey, do you really believe that he has entered the depths of the space? If you ask me, he must have just been stalled for over a year in the outer area, yet tries to make others think that he has continued the journey so that he could shock us.”

“That would really be too shameless.”

No one believed that Ling Han had been able to make it all the way to the source of the waterfall. That was too unrealistic. Not even a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate would be able to do so.

Ling Han did not pay them any regard at all. He came and stood in front of Liu Shishuang and the others.

“How was it?” the Rain Emperor asked.

Ling Han told them briefly about the situation, and made everyone’s heart itch. They, too, wanted to go and take a look at that seal. Unfortunately, the terrifying pressure had still not dispersed. If they entered now, that would be equivalent to committing suicide.

Unlike the others, Yuan Yinglong did not have that much confidence in Ling Han. As he saw it, there was no way that anyone that had not reached Third Tier could enter. Moreover, it had to be a Third Tier without his cultivation level suppressed.

Hence, even if Ling Han really was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, there was still no way he could succeed. He had to be babbling nonsense.

Yuan Yinglong shook his head mentally. Ling Han was only saying this to garner attention, and the reason why he dared to speak such nonsense was because there was no one at all that could enter.

Sigh, but the pressure here would still eventually disperse. By then, when everyone entered, they would realize that Ling Han was just babbling nonsense. What was the point of all this then?

Yuan Yinglong did not speak out about this. After all, Ling Han was much stronger than him. The former had to give him some face.

Everyone waited. At present, no one could do anything anyways.

More and more people came. There were Third Tier, Second Tier, and First Tier Heavenly Venerates. There were also followers that were Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tiers and Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tiers, and the place became extremely lively.

No conflicts erupted among them. They all sat there quietly. At present, there was no conflict of interests among them, but should the pressure here disappear and they become able to enter into the Mystery Realm, it would be a different story.

Everyone was very patient. In any case, they could still cultivate here, though the efficiency would be slightly lowered.

Ling Han had already started using his newly obtained seal. He realized that the efficiency of his communication with the heaven and earth had slightly improved again, but it was only an increase from 32 to 34 times. This seemingly was not a great improvement, but it should be known that this was only a blurry seal.

If he could obtain a complete one, the increase in effectiveness would become even more apparent.

Ling Han tried to immerse the Heavenly Venerable Seal in battle. He discovered that every single Heavenly Venerable Seal had to be “charged” so that it would glow first before it could be used, and in the process of using it, the seal would be “releasing energy.”

When the Heavenly Venerable Seal dimmed down completely, it could no longer be used, and it had to be charged again.

Heavenly Venerable Seals could be used in conjunction with Heavenly Venerate Techniques, compounding the might of a technique.

Unfortunately, Heavenly Venerable Seals could not be used simultaneously. If they were used simultaneously, the might would not increase, either. It would only speed up the process of “releasing energy.”

However, even so, the more Heavenly Venerable Seals one had mastered, the more apparent the increase to one’s battle prowess. That was because the process of releasing energy lasted only two hours. Thus, the more Heavenly Venerable Seals one mastered, the more one would be able to maintain his battle prowess at a high point.

Furthermore, different Heavenly Venerable Seals would have different levels of boosting one’s battle prowess. Ling Han had tested it out. Among the eight seals inside his body, the seven seals that he had obtained through the Divine Demon Sword could only increase his battle prowess by around 10 times, but that incomplete seal could boost his battle prowess by up to 12 times.

And this was when it was in an incomplete state. What if it was a complete seal?

Ling Han’s heart couldn’t help but beat strongly. He definitely had to complete this seal.

As time passed, everyone realized that the pressure here was slowly subsiding.

“Going by the look of things, the pressure would completely disappear in less than a year,” someone estimated.

As expected, after half a year, someone took the risk of entering, and discovered that, as compared to previously, the distance that they could venture in had greatly increased.

Everyone scrambled over each other to get in, fearing that the pressure would suddenly disappear, and someone else would become first to snatch the opportunity.

They traveled alongside the river flow, leaping from one spot to the next.

Yuan Yinglong shockingly discovered that the situation here was just as Ling Han had described.

Could it be that what Ling Han had previously said was all true?

Yuan Yinglong immediately shook his head. No, no, no. Ling Han was very strong. Perhaps he had indeed come here, so it was natural that he could outline the situation. But if they went further, Ling Han’s deceptions would definitely be exposed.

After traveling about two thirds of the way, they stopped. The pressure was still there ahead of them.

Another half year later, they continued further, and then encountered pressure again. They stopped once more.

With them repeatedly stopping and continuing like this, the great lake was finally within their sight about three years later.

“We’ve reached the source!” Everyone was excited.

Yuan Yinglong and his lackeys were all numb with shock. That was because everything was just like how Ling Han had described. It was like he really had come here before.

Was this possible?

Thinking about how terrifying the pressure here had once been, and that Ling Han could still walk freely and leisurely like he was walking on flat land, they wondered, was he really a First Tier Heavenly Venerate? Was he not a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate in disguise by any chance?

The gazes they directed at Ling Han involuntarily became reverent. Originally, they had only thought that Ling Han had been stronger than them, but they had not had any idea exactly how strong he had been. However, now they knew that he was at a height that they could only look up at.

Several days later, ripples appeared on the surface of the lake, giving rise to terrifying, boundless waves, and everyone inhaled sharply. If struck by these waves, even a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate could be smashed into a mush of flesh and blood.

But after the waves passed, golden light flickered on the surface of the lake, turning into an incomplete, blurred seal, yet everyone became excited by this.

Heavenly Venerable Seal.

They were all keen. Once the pressure here subsided, they would dive down to the bottom of the lake, find that Heavenly Venerable Seal, and take this astronomical good fortune alone.

Though things could not be clearly seen from such a great distance, they could still experience some slight bit of the profound power here. Thus, everyone observed. If they could only just grasp a tiny bit, their battle prowess and rate of cultivation could be slightly increased.

Ling Han stood, arms crossed behind his back. He had long since learned this incomplete, blurry Heavenly Venerable Seal. Furthermore, because of the distance, the seal he could see was slightly more complete.

He stood guard over the Empress and the others so that they would not be disturbed while they were in the process of comprehension.

Once every few days, the pressure here would decrease slightly. Thus, everyone would be able to take a step forwards, getting nearer and nearer to the lake. They would also be able to see the Heavenly Venerable Seal clearer and clearer.

...

Finally, after another three months, the pressure here disappeared completely.

Everyone was overjoyed. Some immediately leaped into the lake, and dived to the bottom to find the Heavenly Venerable Seal. Once this seal truly came into existence, the time that it could exist would be extremely limited. It would rapidly disappear.

Hence, anyone who wanted to obtain it would have to do so immediately and as soon as possible. At least, they could not be left behind by anyone else.

In only a short while, those who had dived to the bottom of the lake all appeared. Every single one of them was bloodied and looked extremely miserable.

The pressure inside the lake had not vanished. They couldn’t dive very deep, so they could only come back to the surface.

It would only be this place that could cause such misery to Heavenly Venerates.
