Chapter 1883: Split

After returning to the Lu Clan, Ling Han immediately went to call the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Just as they were about to leave, however, Bewitching Maiden Rou suddenly arrived.

Upon seeing the Empress, a look of apprehension instantly spread across the other seductive woman’s face.

She was stunningly beautiful, and she was confident that she could seduce all people in the world. However, the Empress was even more beautiful and charming than her. This was a huge blow to her self-confidence. Moreover, the Empress was extremely intimidating, and this caused Bewitching Maiden Rou to feel as if she couldn’t lift her head before her.

However, Bewitching Maiden Rou was a bewitching woman, after all, and a radiant smile immediately blossomed across her face. “Oh, the three of you are truly deeply in love! Do you always stick together like this?”

The Empress swept her gaze across the bewitching woman, and there was a dignified and imposing expression on her breathtakingly beautiful face. “Call me big sister!”

The bewitching woman pouted upon hearing this. After hesitating for a brief moment, she said in a soft voice, “Big Sister.” She appeared extremely reluctant yet helpless.

This was the power of strength. Bewitching Maiden Rou was completely helpless when she came across the Empress.

Ling Han couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“We’re about to leave the Lu Clan,” he said.

“What trouble have you caused this time? Did you beat up some Holy Son from the Alchemy City?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked with a worried expression. Ling Han was truly unparalleled when it came to causing trouble. He would cause trouble wherever he went. He had yet to fully resolve his conflict with the two Celestial King Tier forces, yet he had already gone off to provoke a Holy Son from the Alchemy City.

However, this was to be expected from Ling Han.

Ling Han scratched his head upon hearing this. Did Bewitching Maiden Rou already understand him this well?

‘Why didn’t you ask whether I’ve become bored of living at the Lu Clan? Perhaps I’m only going out for a spin to improve my mood?

‘Gasp! Has my trouble-making ability already received public acknowledgment?’

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden covered her mouth and chuckled. It was rare to see her husband being rendered speechless. Moreover, because the Empress was present, she wasn’t afraid of Bewitching Maiden Rou seducing Ling Han away.

“Er, I only beat up a measly alchemy apprentice,” Ling Han said with a calm expression. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Oh...” Bewitching Maiden Rou breathed a sigh of relief. Although alchemists were the most venerated people in the Alchemy City, alchemy apprentices were only alchemy apprentices, after all. Thus, beating them up wouldn’t be a huge deal. At most, one would simply have to pay some compensation. With Ling Han’s current cultivation talent, there would definitely be countless elites willing to help him resolve any problems.

“However, he was Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice,” Ling Han added.

If it had been anyone else, they would have definitely spat a mouthful of blood upon hearing this. However, Bewitching Maiden Rou was from the Purity Sect, after all, so she was most skilled in controlling her expressions. Thus, she didn’t lose her composure because of this. However, the expression on her beautiful face was still quite spectacular.

She was naturally aware of who Alchemist Zi Cheng was. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come here to participate in the competition for the Dao Regulating Pill.

‘You actually beat up Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice?

‘Gasp! Why don’t you ascend to the heavens?!’

Although Alchemy City was only a four-star force, its status could somewhat rival that of Celestial King Tier forces due to the esteemed position of alchemists. That being the case, Alchemist Zi Cheng could naturally be viewed as somewhat of a Celestial King as well.

Ling Han had beat up the subordinate of a Celestial King, so was he not trying to ascend to the heavens?

“Go, go, go! We need to hurry up and leave!” Bewitching Maiden Rou frantically said. Powerful cultivators like them stored everything in Spatial God Tools, so they could immediately leave at any time they wanted.

Ling Han was slightly surprised, and he said, “This has got nothing to do with you, so why are you leaving as well? Moreover, that Lu Xianming seems to be fairly interested in you. Aren’t you going to stay and become the wife of an alchemist?”

“Whan nonsense! My aspirations are grand, and my future husband definitely has to be an elite capable of ruling over an entire territory. Measly alchemists are nothing but playthings in my palm!” There was a proud expression on her face, and she continued, “Men who can’t conquer me aren’t worthy of my attention!”

Ling Han was stunned upon hearing this. Which man in the world could conquer this greatly bewitching woman?

He was certain that he couldn’t do so.

“Rest assured, I’m here to help!” the Empress whispered into his ear. Perhaps others couldn’t conquer Bewitching Maiden Rou, but she definitely could.

A strange expression spread across Ling Han’s face. From the beginning until now, the Empress had never abandoned any opportunity to “capture” this bewitching woman who possessed the Nine Revolutions Charm Physique. However, it was extremely odd that she was trying to capture another beautiful woman for him as his wife herself.

The four of them hurriedly started to leave. However, just as they exited the main gates, they saw Lu Xianming and the others returning.

Sun Dong wore a smug expression of success.

He had initially thought that he would need to swallow his humiliation, and he had thought that he would never be able to exact revenge. Moreover, he might even need to act respectfully before Ling Han, and do his best to please him. After all, it was clear that Lu Xianming held Ling Han in higher regard. Unexpectedly, however, Ling Han had actually gone off to complete an examination to become an alchemist or whatnot. This had directly pitted him against Lu Xianming.

Afterward, he even beat up Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice.

He hadn’t witnessed this scene, because he had arrived slightly later. Upon learning of it, however, he had laughed loudly after faltering for a brief moment.

Ling Han was a huge troublemaker.

Ling Han had beaten him up before, so now that his status had risen, was it a surprise that he had beaten up Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice?

“Ling Han!” Lu Xianming’s expression was dark, and he said, “Where have I offended you? Why are you treating me like this?”

If Ling Han had only beaten up Alchemy Apprentice Mo, Lu Xianming could have helped him resolve things with his status as a Holy Son. At most, he would only need to give up some slight benefits.

However, Ling Han had directly taken the exam to become a One-Star Alchemist without even consulting him. Just what kind of attitude was this?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Brother Lu, I think you’re misunderstanding something. I’m only your guest, not your subordinate. I don’t need to ask for your agreement or permission to do anything. Moreover, I’ve only stayed at your place for a few days, so how am I mistreating you by doing this?”

An expression of slight fury spread across Lu Xianming’s face, and he said, “Are you intent on opposing me?”

Ling Han sighed upon hearing this. Why did Lu Xianming always act as if he owed him something?

In terms of owing things, Lu Xianming owed him a life!

How inexplicable!

Lu Xianming had truly lost himself to the title of Holy Son. Did he believe that everyone needed to sacrifice themselves for him?

Who had indulged him into developing such a wild belief?

“Think what you want,” Ling Han said with a wave of his hand. He then calmly strode away.

“Celestial Maiden Rou!” Lu Xianming shouted. “Are you truly going to follow this person? I urge you to think this through! This will bring calamity upon not only you, but perhaps even the Purity Sect!”

“Thank you for your hospitality, Holy Son Lu. However, I’ve already disturbed you for too long, so I won’t trouble Young Master Lu any longer!” Bewitching Maiden Rou said without even turning around to face him.

Lu Xianming’s expression became even darker. He naturally understood that this was only an excuse from Bewitching Maiden Rou. In reality, she was trying to draw a line between herself and him.

He clenched his fists as he wallowed in this feeling of betrayal.

First, it was Ling Han. He had eaten his food and lived at his place, yet he had actually gone off to take an examination to become an alchemist. His actions were as dishonorable as could be! Then it was Bewitching Maiden Rou. He had already been conquered by her beauty and charm, and he had viewed her as his future wife. Now, however, she was actually leaving without any reluctance at all!

This was naturally a one-sided affection on Lu Xianming’s part. To say nothing of the fact that Ling Han didn’t owe him, it was also preposterous to expect Bewitching Maiden Rou to offer her body just because he had hosted her for two days!

Ling Han was already tired of dealing with Lu Xianming. He waved his hand and walked away.

If Lu Xianming were smart, this matter would conclude right here and now. If that were the case, everything would naturally be fine. If he were intent on causing more trouble, however, Ling Han also wouldn’t hold back anymore.

Bewitching Maiden Rou quickened her pace. If she had to make a choice, Ling Han was naturally far more reliable than Lu Xianming.
