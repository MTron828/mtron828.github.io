Chapter 1215: Eliminating All Witnesses

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hu Niu swept her gaze around the surroundings. Everyone fell to their knees, not daring to hold her gaze.

In any case, they didn’t feel ashamed for kneeling. After all, this was a Saint.

“Girl, that’s enough. Follow me back to the palace!” an old woman in cyan said. No one had seen how she had arrived. Her appearance was sudden, yet her existence seemed especially natural. It was as if she had been standing there the entire time—it was just that no one had noticed her.

They couldn’t sense the old woman’s aura, and it seemed as if she were just an ordinary person.

Ling Han knew that this old woman wouldn’t let Hu Niu run around by herself. However, what astounded him was the fact that the old woman in cyan was still worried about Hu Niu even though she had already reached the Genesis Tier.

‘Just how powerful is the Roc Palace’s enemy? Are they so powerful that even Saints need protection?

‘Perhaps Hu Niu is only a Small Saint, whereas their enemy is a Saint King?’

Hu Niu shook her head frantically, and said, “No! I don’t want to!” She leaped into Ling Han’s arms and hugged him tightly, saying, “Niu doesn’t want to leave Ling Han again!”

“No way!” The old woman in cyan tapped her walking stick on the ground, and said, “If you stay here, you’ll endanger not only yourself, but also that young lad.”

This old grandma understood the situation fairly well. She knew that convincing Hu Niu alone would be useless, so she added Ling Han into the equation.

Hu Niu’s expression instantly became serious, and she stopped acting so immaturely.

Everyone was stunned. Judging by the old woman’s words, it seemed as if even Genesis Tier Saints weren’t powerful enough to protect themselves.

A ruthless expression appeared on the old woman’s face, and she said, “You people know too much.”

She casually waved her left hand.

Pa, pa, pa!

Everyone in the surroundings exploded into clouds of blood.

Ling Han had reacted quickly, and he had hurriedly entered the Black Tower with Empress Luan Xing. During such a dangerous situation, he obviously couldn’t worry about whether or not his Black Tower was exposed. However, Saints could create worlds, genuinely open up space, and thus forge Spatial God Tools. So... the old woman probably wouldn’t be envious of Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool.

Sure enough, the old woman in cyan merely stared at him for a moment before saying, “Young lad, keep your mouth shut and don’t tell anyone about today’s events!”

This old woman was extremely ruthless. Hu Niu had only attacked and killed those people to exact revenge for Ling Han. However, the old woman in cyan had killed over 20 Heavenly Body Tier elites simply to keep a secret.

Moreover, it was clearly her who had made a slip of the tongue... no, in fact, she hadn’t really made a slip of the tongue. After all, she hadn’t revealed any secrets at all.

These people had died a meaningless death.

Hu Niu was furious upon hearing the old woman’s words, and she jabbed her finger at her before fuming, “Ugly old woman, you dare to threaten Niu’s Ling Han? Niu is going to banish you to the borderlands to be a coolie!”

The old woman in cyan was both exasperated and helpless. Who told this disobedient girl to be the successor of the Roc Palace? She pondered for a moment before saying, “I’ll give you three days. After three days, you must follow me back.”

Hu Niu’s eyes darted around, and she said, “Deal!” She then waved her hand, and said, “Ugly old woman, hurry up and go away. Just looking at you is annoying me!”

The old woman in cyan humphed in displeasure. She then turned around and took a step, after which her entire body disappeared.

More figures hurried over from the distance at this moment. Some were flying in the sky, while others were running on the ground.

These were the elites who had come to participate in the auction. However, the commotion here had been far too loud, so they decided to pause the auction and hurry over.

Hu Niu grabbed Ling Han, and said, “Let’s leave!”

Xiu!

They instantly traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers away from the Majestic Heaven Sect. They had disappeared without a trace.

When the elites arrived, they discovered that the main peak had already become a pile of obliterated rubble. They could vaguely sense a powerful aura in the blood here, and this aura was so overwhelming that they didn’t dare near it.

A terrifying speculation formed in their minds. However, they refused to believe this speculation.

Was anyone in this galaxy powerful enough to threaten Venerable Trinity? However, the Majestic Heaven Sect had been obliterated, and a heavy sense of grief hung in the air. So, where had Venerable Trinity gone?

This became an eternal mystery. Even sometime tens of millions of years later, people still didn’t know what had happened on this day.

“Ling Han, have you missed Niu?” In someplace far, far away, Ling Han and Hu Niu sat on a boulder that overlooked the sea. The young girl was resting in Ling Han’s lap, and there was a look of attachment on her face.

“Of course I have.” Ling Han smiled, and said, “I was planning to look for you after I reached the Sun Moon Tier. However, who would’ve thought that you’d find me first?”

Hu Niu immediately started to giggle, and she said, “There’s no way you could have found me!”

“Why?” Ling Han asked.

Hu Niu pondered for a moment before saying, “Because Niu is in the Celestial Realm. You can’t go there yet.”

“Celestial Realm? What’s the Celestial Realm?” Ling Han asked.

“Ahem!” The old woman in cyan silently appeared, and said, “Girl, you’ll only endanger him if you say too much.”

‘F*ck! She’s like an unshakable shadow!’

Hu Niu pouted, and said, “I know!” She then shuffled closer to Ling Han, and whispered, “Ling Han, let’s have kids!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered aloud. The old woman in cyan was also furious, and she said, “Girl, if you continue, I’ll kill this young lad!”

Hu Niu humphed, and said, “You guys are so boring! I was only joking!”

However, Ling Han and the old woman in cyan both knew that Hu Niu wasn’t joking. She could definitely do such things.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Let’s go back. Otherwise, the others will all be anxious.”

“Rotten old lady, it’s all your fault!” Hu Niu said in displeasure. She had wanted to take this opportunity to conceive an adorable son with Ling Han. However, the old lady had broken her promise and followed them in secret.

The old woman in cyan humphed in reply. She admitted that Ling Han was prodigious, being able to cultivate to his current level in such a short amount of time. However, he was still eons away from being a suitable match for the young successor of the Roc Palace.

Their relationship... was absolutely impossible!

“Ling Han!” Shui Yanyu and the others immediately ran over. They had all heard about the commotion on the Majestic Heaven Sect just then, so they were naturally worried about Ling Han. They finally breathed a sigh of relief after seeing him.

Shui Yanyu wanted to leap into Ling Han’s arms, yet she was immediately plucked up by Hu Niu. There was killing intent in Hu Niu’s eyes, and she said, “Ling Han, this bewitching woman tried to assassinate you! Let me kill her!”

“Nonsense!” Ling Han hurriedly shook his head in disapproval. This girl was as jealous as always.

Hu Niu pouted unhappily, and her eyes darted around. She would definitely take this bewitching woman with her when she left. She couldn’t leave her by Ling Han’s side.

“Huh? Hu Niu!” Feng Po Yun, Mu Rong Qing, and Helian Tianyun exclaimed in astonishment. They had personally witnessed Hu Niu leaving, and they hadn’t expected her to suddenly appear again.

Hu Niu completely ignored them. There was only Ling Han in her eyes, and she didn’t give a toss about anyone else.

“Huh? She’s Hu Niu?” Ding Ping asked in surprise. He had heard his master and his uncles mention her before.

“Wah! Such a beautiful girl!” The old ginseng was also here, and he involuntarily started to drool upon seeing Hu Niu. This young girl was far too beautiful. His lust made him fearless, and he immediately lunged toward Hu Niu, saying, “Young girl, let grandpa ginseng examine your development!”
