Chapter 2381: Smacked to death

This slap was too quick. To say nothing of the fact that Kong Shuang could not dodge in time at all, even Kong An and the others did not manage to stop Ling Han in time, and could only watch helplessly as Kong Shuang was turned into a shower of blood.

Blood sprayed and spurted on them, but their defensive power was automatically activated, and blocked the blood spray, so none of it touched them.

The three elites first felt disbelief, but it was quickly followed by thunderous fury as they also felt an indescribable embarrassment.

With who they were and how strong they were, they actually allowed Ling Han to kill someone right in front of their eyes. How could they possibly tolerate that?

“Whoever you are, your only destined path is death!” Kong An declared coldly.

“You will be hung on the city gates of Three Cloud City, and suffer a million years of torture!” Kong Le continued.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe hesitated slightly, and then stood up as well. “Brothers Kong, this boy has nothing to do with our clan!” He hurriedly drew a clear dividing line between Ling Han and their clan.

“Hehe, just because you say he has nothing to do with your clan, he truly is unrelated?” Kong Ye demanded menacingly. Usually, it would only be the Kong Clan that would be bullying others. When would it ever be someone else that was bullying them instead?

Not only would Ling Han have to die, the Luan Clan would also have to pay an enormous price, or everyone would think that the Kong Clan was an easy target for bullies.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe had a grim expression. He had always had a high opinion of himself. As he was someone who possessed the bloodline of a Celestial King, his strength would definitely be stronger than the usual Ascending Origin Tiers’. Hence, even in a battle of one against three, he still had the confidence that he would not lose.

But the Kong Clan has practically been blessed by the heavens. The Ascending Origin Tier elites in the clan actually numbered in the hundreds. If they were mobilized all at once, no matter how strong he was, he would still only be able to bow down in submission.

Hence, he presently hated Ling Han to death.

Killing a Severing Mundane Tier naturally was just a small matter, but the crux of the matter was just how much trouble would be incited after killing him.

Luan Sang discerned his thoughts from his body language, and immediately jumped out, exclaiming, “Ling Han, you actually dare to commit a crime in the ancestral grounds of our Nine Snake Tribe. Your sin deserves 10,000 deaths!” He took the initiative to move, launching an attack on Ling Han.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe nodded secretly. This clan member was really clever. The former had indeed not doted on him for nothing.

Pa!

The Empress moved, and sent out a palm strike. Instantly, Luan Sang was turned into a shower of blood.

…She was presently an Eleventh Secret monarch star, and had also developed some Source Power, so her battle prowess had attained the peak stage of Small Accomplishment level of the Ascending Origin Tier, and was even slightly stronger than that. It was naturally just a small gesture for her to smack a Third Secret emperor tier to death.

‘Holy! F*ck!’

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe gaped, soundlessly mouthing these words.

Because he had not been able to discern the Empress’s cultivation level, added with how the Empress had only stayed in the underground palace for a day, he had gotten some ideas, and thought that it was extremely possible that the Empress had lied about her cultivation level. But once the Empress made her move, it was world-shaking. The aura of her cultivation level was indeed only Immortal Palace Tier, but the strength of her battle prowess had spiked all the way to the Ascending Origin Tier.

This was too terrifying. How could an Immortal Palace Tier possibly possess Ascending Origin Tier’s battle prowess?

He had been too closed off, and had absolutely no idea that there were emperor tiers and monarch stars in this world, so he could not imagine how a mere Immortal Palace Tier would actually be able to match Ascending Origin Tier at all.

If he had known early on how powerful the Empress was, he should have spared no expense to protect her.

F***, with such outstanding talent, why had she stayed for only a day in the underground palace?

He naturally could not possibly know that the Empress had cultivated a celestial physique of Time. In the first place, this physique was supreme in the entire Celestial Realm. Additionally, she herself was also equivalent to the flow of time. In the eyes of others, it might only have been a single day, but in truth, she was the only one who could know just how many days had passed.

Kong An’s expression was icy. Why was this couple both so strange? They clearly were exuding an aura that was only at the Immortal Palace Tier, yet had such astonishing battle prowess? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You do indeed have some strength. No wonder you dared to commit an outrage!” he sneered, his heart already calmed.

He merely could not understand why they, being only in the Immortal Palace Tier, could have Ascending Origin Tier’s battle prowess, but whether it was Ling Han or the Empress, the battle prowess they both exhibited was only Small Accomplishment level of the Ascending Origin Tier. Compared to him, they were still very, very far off.

What did he need to fear?

“Take them down!” He moved aggressively, grabbing out at Ling Han, and Kong Le moved as well, launching an assault on the Empress.

Ling Han smiled calmly, clenching his right hand into a fist. Without using any power of Regulation, he just sent out a very ordinary, average punch.

“You are seeking death!” Kong An smirked cody. ‘Without using the power of Regulation, you dare to clash with me? You only have the battle prowess of Small Accomplishment level of the Ascending Origin Tier. Even if you unleash all that completely, that is still far from being a match for me. What else could this be but seeking death?’

He did not want Ling Han to die so easily, so he reserved a portion of his power to avoid landing too strong a blow that would kill Ling Han immediately.

On the other side, the Empress did not dare to face consummate-level Ascending Origin Tier battle prowess head-on. She turned into the flow of time. It seemed like she was in the present, but also in the past, and in a blur seemed to be the future, all at the same time. Aside from Celestial Kings that had grasped the essence of the Regulations of Time, who else could wound her?

Peng!

Liao Kong and Kong An exchanged a blow, and it was visibly Kong An’s fist that exploded first, and then his arm exploded with flesh and blood, just like an umbrella that had been opened, revealing eerily white bone.

Then the bone, too, shattered suddenly, and his whole arm was gone.

Seeing this scene, everyone was gaping in shock, their scalps completely numb.

This was too terrifying. This was a consummate-level Ascending Origin Tier, and his arm had actually been obliterated with a single punch!

Yi, could it be that their previous knowledge was all mistaken? It was the Ascending Origin Tier that was actually the third rung on the ladder of the celestial path, and the Immortal Palace Tier was actually superior?

Seeing how Kong An had been defeated with a single strike, Kong Le naturally was in no mood to attack the Empress further. In truth, he, too, could do nothing against her.

The three members of the Kong Clan all set their eyes on Ling Han, thinking that this young man was practically like a demon, and the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe was also trembling. He had only thought that he had mistakenly judged the Empress. He had not imagined that his biggest mistake was underestimating Ling Han.

He had seriously underestimated him.

Though he was confident that his strength was superior to that of Kong An and the others, it was still absolutely impossible for him to pulverize one of Kong An’s arms with a single punch.

Even he was terrified by this kind of battle prowess.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Now that I have helped you teach a lesson to an unruly junior, are you really all so ungrateful?”

‘You have killed a junior of our clan, and actually want us to thank you for it?’

Kong An and the others were outraged, but faced with Ling Han’s inconceivable strength, they could only swallow their anger and suffer the humiliation.

“Sir, thank you for moving to help dispose of the dregs of our clan,” Kong Ye forced out through gritted teeth, feeling like his heart was bleeding.

This was an extraordinary humiliation!

Ling Han nodded, and said, “You guys would not be so shameless to ask that I move for free, right? You don’t have to pay too much; just give me a red?packet1.”

The three members from the Kong Clan wanted nothing more than to have a life and death struggle with Ling Han. He had gone too far. Not only had he killed a member of the Kong Clan, and wounded an elite of the Kong Clan, he actually was asking them for a red packet now?

What an intolerable bully!

But that amazing strength of Ling Han was clear to see, intimidating them to the point that they could only keep to their best behavior.

After a moment’s discussion, they took out a Spatial God Tool which they tossed over to Ling Han. Kong An said, “Sir, can we take our leave now?”

Ling Han asked lazily, “Yi, was there anyone that was stopping you?”

The three of them glared hard at Ling Han. They would definitely return and get their vengeance!

No matter how strong Ling Han was, he was only a single person, and the Kong Clan had over 100 Ascending Origin Tier elites. The majority of them were already at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, and had the potential to advance to the Celestial King Tier. With so many of them against him, how could he possibly not be suppressed?

The three members of the Kong Clan left in dejection, leaving behind the members of the Luan Clan that were greatly stunned.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han wrapped an arm gently around the Empress’s waist.

The Empress nodded, without the slightest reluctance. For her, this clan only consisted of a great number of strangers.

“Wait,” the Ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe called out hurriedly.
