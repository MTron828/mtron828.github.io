Chapter 1616: Deciding through battle

“Lord Patriarch, have you calmed your emotions a bit? Can we discuss peacefully now?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

The Long Tribe patriarch’s expression was dark. “No wonder you dared to behave so unreasonably, so you are so strong! However, this is the Long Tribe, where there are two Saints watching over, so no matter how strong you are, what would you be able to do?”

“Sigh, you are being unreasonable here!” Ling Han said. “Look, I am making a proper marriage proposal to your clan, yet you are already declaring violence. Is this the way you treat a guest?”

The Long Tribe patriarch couldn’t help but explode with fury. ‘The crux of the matter here is that your request has overstepped the boundaries. Isn’t wanting to break the betrothal contract with a Saint King simply putting the Long Tribe on the fire?’

He surged with dragon’s might, wanting to start an aggressive counterattack.

Ling Han only acted as if he had not seen it. HIs right hand gripped the other’s dragon arm as if it was just a child he was holding.

In front of Ling Han, the Long Tribe patriarch was really not much different from a child. No matter how intimidating your dragon’s might was, and no matter how much your dragon’s blood boiled to increase your battle prowess, so what?

The Long Tribe patriarch struggled with all his might. He was already covered with sweat, yet it was as if Ling Han had fallen asleep. That was how indescribably relaxed he was.

‘This...!’

The Long Tribe patriarch was astonished. Just how wide was the power gap between the two of them? Gritting his teeth, he suddenly drew out a divine sword from his Spatial Spirit Tool. The blade of the sword was actually forged from a white bone, and there were multiple divine patterns that were already shining brightly on it.

This was the backbone of an ancestor of the Long Tribe. Before he had died, he himself had plucked it out, and forged it into a God Tool!

Saint Tool!

Weng, the Dragon Bone Sword was activated. This was the Long Tribe, and the Long Tribe patriarch had a special boost. Instantly, this allowed this Saint Tool to be activated to the maximum. A crimson True Dragon flew out of the sword’s blade, pouncing to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han’s eyes widened slightly. Only now had it become a little more interesting. He stretched out his hand to grab the True Dragon, the killing formations inside him activating. Countless formation patterns were densely interwoven with each other, and ultimately became a sword that struck out at that True Dragon.

A bizarre event occurred. With a sweep of its tail, that True Dragon actually sank back into the Dragon Bone Sword.

It had been scared into fleeing!

The Long Tribe patriarch was dumbfounded. This, this, this, this... the Dragon Bone Sword was actually terrified of Ling Han!

The Tool Spirit of this sword was actually a wisp of spirit from that ancestor as it had been forged from a bone that he had plucked out himself. However, it had long since lost sentience, and was only left with the instinct to protect the Long Tribe.

But as long as it had become a Tool Spirit, it had a basic trait, and that was that it would instinctively protect itself. Only if it was undamaged would it be able to complete its goal of protection.

Thus, unless absolutely necessary, this kind of precious tool would definitely not battle to the point of being destroyed.

Just exactly how f******* strong were you that you could actually induce fear from a completely activated Saint Tool!

Ling Han broke into a smile, and asked, “Lord Patriarch, can we now discuss calmly?”

“Discuss, we will discuss.” The Long Tribe patriarch only felt his head was buzzing, his thoughts in a complete mess.

The discussion between the two of them that followed was naturally absolutely meaningless. The Long Tribe patriarch didn’t even know what he was saying. Ling Han did not mind it, either. In any case, he was purely here to make trouble.

After talking for a while, Ling Han left boldly, and with Long Yushan’s adding fuel to the fire, there was a rumor that spread through the grapevine of the Long Tribe: Ling Han robbed Zhong Badu of his prize, and had made a marriage proposal for Long Yushan to the Long Tribe, and the generosity of his bridal gift was astonishing.

Not too long after, this news had reached the ears of Zhong Badu.

Pa!

With a palm strike, he had rendered the stone table in front of him into bits. He suddenly stood, his eyes blazing with killing intent.

Previously, he had not killed Ling Han completely because he had not wanted to offend the ancestor of the Long Tribe, but this brat actually wasn’t just satisfied with that, and actually dared to entertain ideas about his woman!

This was unacceptable!

“Young Master!” Jing Yi and Yang Zige both took a step forwards.

Zhong Badu suppressed his fury, crossing his arms behind his back. This was only a small rumor. The Long Tribe would not possibly dare break the betrothal, as that would anger a Saint King—who would be able to sustain the fury from a Saint King in this world?

That person.... was only trying to get attention. There was no need to pay the matter any mind. When he left the Long Tribe, he would kill him so that he would know how serious the consequences of angering him were.

Yet, the matter was not like how Zhong Badu thought it was—not merely the attention-seeking act from an ugly person. It was said that Long Yushan’s attitude was very ambiguous, and there was even news that the ancestor of the grand elder was going to be asked to come out of seclusion, and make a new assessment of this betrothal.

With this, Zhong Badu could no longer sit calmly. What was going on here? Did you all really dare to break the betrothal with him?

It was true that he admired Long Yushan’s beauty and strength, but what he prized more was her bloodline of the Dragon Tribe. In a unity with a member of their Zhong Clan, it was possible that an incredibly strong descendant could be born in future.

This was a matter that the Open Clouds King himself had personally commanded. He had to complete this mission fully. Furthermore, the Open Clouds Forbidden Land had long since publicized this betrothal. If the betrothal was suddenly broken at this time, both himself and the Open Clouds Forbidden Land would be humiliated.

It definitely couldn’t happen!

He immediately went off to seek Long Yushan, yet was refused entrance, which gave him a stronger feeling of foreboding. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a few days, Ling Han issued a challenge to Zhong Badu.

If Zhong Badu won, he would leave without another word, but if Zhong Badu lost, then he would have to obediently cancel the betrothal.

What an intolerable bully!

Zhong Badu’s fury could not be restrained. He was the son of a Forbidden Land; when had he suffered such injustice in his whole life?

He did not even consider, and immediately agreed to Ling Han’s request.

He would battle!

Zhong Badu smirked internally. At first, he had planned to kill Ling Han after he left the Long Tribe. Since this brat was actually so determined to seek death himself, then he would naturally have to oblige.

The two sides made an agreement to battle in the galaxy three days later.

Three days passed very quickly. Both Ling Han and Zhong Badu had arrived in the galaxy. Yang Zige and Jing Yi were standing behind Zhong Badu, and there was not a single person behind Ling Han. The Long Tribe were not helping either side, and were standing in a more central position, not siding with either party.

At first, Long Xiangyue had wanted to cheer Ling Han on, yet Long Yushan had grabbed her and stopped her. Thus, she could only gloomily watch as a spectator in the middle.

“Ling Han!” Zhong Badu roared in fury, his voice sounding out like thunder. There was actually a sliver of dragon’s might in his voice as well.

It seemed like the Zhong Clan had other intentions in wanting to marry Long Yushan. Otherwise, to preserve the purity of their bloodline, Forbidden Lands would usually seek their partners from among their own clans.

Ling Han dug his ear, and blew out a breath. “What are you calling out so loud for? I am not deaf!”

“Why do I think that not only are you deaf, you are also blind and an idiot as well?” Zhong Badu smirked coldly. “If you had eyes, and had a brain, you would know that you should not have made an enemy of me. Even if you are a Saint, you would also be turned into ash by our Open Clouds Forbidden Land!”

Pa, pa, pa. Ling Han clapped his hands. “Your words sound better than any song. I will give you some encouragement, and have no fear that you would become proud of it.”

Zhong Badu looked at Ling Han. “Where exactly are you from?”

If he did not have the backing on the level of Saint King, how could he dare to oppose him? If he could manage to cultivate to this kind of level and was still an idiot, he really did not believe that was really possible.

“Ling Han, a lone cultivator,” Ling Han stated calmly.

“Since that is the case, then you can just die!” Zhong Badu had lost all patience. His figure charged out. He was going to crush Ling Han to pieces.
