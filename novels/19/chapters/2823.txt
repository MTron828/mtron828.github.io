2824 Good Times Don’t Last Long?

Ling Han felt extremely flattered by the praise.

A paramount Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate saw such promise in him?

During Ling Han’s time in the Realm Battlefield, Lin Luo had already thought highly of him and been optimistic about his future. As such, he had given Ling Han quite a bit of help. Meanwhile, his three disciples Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and Lin Xiaoyang and his son had further provided Ling Han with a lot of help.

It was thanks to Ling Han’s time cultivating at the Lin Clan that he was able to reach the Eighth Heaven at such a lightning-quick speed.

“I must express my sincere gratitude to Senior Lin,” Ling Han said.

“Keep up the good work; I also have high hopes for you,” Lin Youlian said with a nod. There was a look of encouragement on her face.

She paused for a moment before saying, “Let’s go.”

The two of them quickly found an exit. Upon stepping through it, they immediately found themselves in a vast plain.

Lin Youlian waved her hand before gracefully disappearing into the distance.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. Was there a man who could capture the attention of this fairy-like woman? He shook his head and pushed away these thoughts. This had nothing to do with him; he already had a warm and loving family.

Ling Han left the ancient tomb. Regardless of whether it was the Heavenly Venerable Seals or the secret technique concealed within it, he had already obtained them all. Thus, was there any need to stay?

Moreover, his identity had already been exposed, so it was certain that many elites had their sights set on him. As such, his best option was to leave.

After arriving back at the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, Ling Han reunited with the Empress and the others. After all, they had already agreed to gather there if they were separated from each other in the ancient tomb.

None of the others had gained anything from this trip. However, after learning that Ling Han had obtained all four of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, they all felt extremely happy for him.

It was a shame, though, that Ling Han couldn’t teach the Four Forms Technique to the others, as this required the support of four Heavenly Venerable Seals. Without these seals, all attempts would be futile.

“Let’s go, let’s visit our daughter,” Ling Han said with a smile.

He and the Empress changed their appearance a bit before entering the martial academy. However, after walking around the entire martial academy, they discovered that their daughter still had yet to return. Ling Han couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

His daughter was far too beautiful, so what would happen if she encountered a man with impure motives?

He clearly knew that Ling Xi possessed power that could rival Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, yet he still felt extremely worried at this moment. This was his worry as a father.

“I can’t help but feel worried,” Ling Han said. “I need to look for her.”

The Empress felt much more relaxed and at ease than him, but since Ling Han had decided to look for his daughter, she naturally wouldn’t be against it.

They set off to look for Ling Xi.

Several years later, they arrived at a small town. According to some records, Ling Xi had once stayed here seven years ago.

They were very close to finding their daughter.

“From what I’ve gathered, Ling Xi was searching for the treasures of an ancient Celestial King. This is the most likely location, so why don’t we wait here? We might come across her at any moment,” Ling Han said.

The Empress nodded in agreement. They settled down, waiting to reunite with their daughter.

Ling Han now possessed 13 Heavenly Venerable Seals, and if he channeled them together, his cultivation speed could be increased 109-fold. This seemed astounding. However, taking into account the boundless Powers of Dimension within him, this speed was in fact still very slow.

At the very least, the cultivation speed of the Empress was far quicker than his. Right now, she had already reached the late stage of the First Tier, and wasn’t far from reaching the peak stage.

As for Ling Han?

He had only just discovered the path to reach the middle stage. However, it would still be quite a long time until he actually reached it.

Oh, Heavenly Venerable Seals! He still needed many, many more of them!

As they waited, 37 years passed.

This wasn’t a very long time. After all, spending tens of thousands of years on some random adventure was nothing in the eyes of Ling Han.

On this day, astonishing thunder and lightning suddenly boomed through heaven and earth, causing the ground to quake, and making it seem like the sky was about to collapse.

Ling Han’s eyes suddenly snapped open, and he gazed into the distance. It was as if nothing could escape his gaze, no matter how far.

A smile spread across his face. However, his expression quickly froze, and it appeared indescribably strange.

Every father who had experienced his daughter marrying would understand what this expression represented.

“Hmm? Little Xi has a companion,” the Empress said.

She could also see Ling Xi flying toward the small town. However, she wasn’t alone, and there was an elegant-looking man next to her. He appeared handsome and extraordinary.

“This bastard,” Ling Han murmured. He felt a murderous urge.

It wasn’t long before Ling Xi and the man arrived above the small town. The Empress reached out with her divine sense, causing Ling Xi to instantly stop in her tracks.

“What’s wrong, Junior Sister Ling?” the young man asked.

Ling Xi wore a surprised expression as she replied, “My mother’s here.”

“Oh?” The young man hurriedly nodded before saying, “Then we must pay Aunty a visit.”

The two of them descended, landing before the inn that Ling Han and the Empress were staying in.

The Empress walked out first. They hadn’t seen their daughter for many years, so even with her aloof personality, she still missed her a little.

“Mom!” Ling Xi exclaimed as she jumped into the Empress’ embrace. After so many years, she had already grown up and become a young lady whose beauty was in no way inferior to the Empress’. Standing together, they were like two lotuses who were equally beautiful and equally breathtaking.

The Empress lightly stroked her daughter’s head. As for the young man, she completely ignored him.

To say nothing of the fact that he had no intimate relationship with Ling Xi, even if they were married, the Empress would still definitely ignore him. There was zero possibility that she would like him the more that she looked at him.

“Mom, where’s Dad?” Ling Xi asked.

“Upstairs,” the Empress replied as she pointed up.

“Huh? Then why isn’t Dad coming down?” Ling Xi asked in confusion. In the Ling Clan, it was definitely Ling Han who doted on her the most. Now that they hadn’t seen each other for so long, he was actually remaining seated upstairs?

“He’s a bit angry right now,” the Empress replied with a smile. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Xi felt even more confused. Angry? Angry about what? Was there anything to be angry about?

...

She hurriedly ran upstairs, saying, “I’m going to see Dad first.” She had no time to care about her companion.

The young man bowed, and said, “Greetings, Aunty. I’m Hao Jing.” He appeared neither haughty nor humble.

He either was an extremely proud person, or he had an extremely powerful background. Otherwise, how would he dare to act so casually before a First Tier Heavenly Venerate as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

The Empress made no reply. Apart from Ling Han and her daughter, everyone else was worthless in her eyes.

Hao Jing couldn’t help but feel slightly awkward after being given the cold shoulder. He could only raise his hand to rub his nose.

Upstairs, Ling Xi immediately saw the sitting Ling Han after entering the room. However, his eyes were tightly shut, and it was as if he were sleeping.

She walked over and called softly, “Dad.”

Ling Han ignored her. Only after Ling Xi called him a few more times did he finally open his eyes, saying, “It’s been so long, yet you didn’t come back to visit.”

“Xi’er returned once. However, Ling City already didn’t exist,” Ling Xi said. “But I know just how capable Dad is, so I knew that there definitely wouldn’t be any dangers.”

“Of course, your dad—” Ling Han was just about to brag. However, he immediately stopped himself, knowing that he couldn’t let his daughter change the topic. He cleared his throat, and asked, “Who’s that brat outside?”

Ling Xi came to a sudden realization. No wonder her dad was feeling angry! It was all because of jealousy.

...

She couldn’t help but find this funny. “He’s just a senior from the martial academy. We coincidentally traveled to the ruins together to search for treasures. He’s called Hao Jing.”

“Hao Jing? Good times don’t last long1?” Ling Han shook his head, musing, “What a crappy name.”

Ling Xi was rendered speechless. Ling Han disliked him so much that even his name needed to be made fun of?
