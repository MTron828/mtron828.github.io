1266 Two-faced

Jin Xuan was a powerful figure, after all, so he returned with the Realm Spirit Stone first upon seeing that Ling Han had already forgiven them. Meanwhile, Jin Xuan accompanied Ling Han like an obsequious underling. He would take this opportunity to flatter him.

He was a Level Eight alchemist! This was extremely, extremely impressive.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had a much more thorough understanding of the situation than Jin Xuan. Jin Ming evidently detested Jin Xuan already, and it was obvious that he wouldn’t remain here much longer. Thus, Ling Han couldn’t be bothered dealing with him, either. He merely gave half-hearted answers to his flattery.

“Young Master Han, please!” There was an obsequious smile on Jin Xuan’s face as he invited Ling Han to an Earth-level private room on the third floor.

In the Gold Origin Auction House, private rooms were divided into two categories—Heaven-level and Earth-level. Generally speaking, the Heaven-level private rooms were always empty. This was because only Eternal River Tier elites had the right to use them.

That was right, Eternal River Tier Elites—not their descendants, nor their successors.

Meanwhile, Earth-level private rooms could be used by many more people. Heavenly Body Tier elites, descendents of Eternal River Tier elites, or people with much success in alchemy and tool refinement could all use these rooms. Thus, there were only a measly few Heaven-level private rooms, while there were two entire floors of Earth-level private rooms.

However, since there were two floors of such rooms, there would clearly be a difference between them. The rooms on the higher floor were obviously a tad better.

Right now, Jin Xuan was leading Ling Han to one of these better Earth-level private rooms. He was expressing his respect to Ling Han, just as he had expressed his respect to Xie Donglai.

Creak...

The door of a private room creaked open, and a handsome young man walked out. He was none other than Xie Donglai.

An astonished look appeared on his face when he saw Jin Xuan walking over with Ling Han. He was especially confused when he saw that Jin Xuan was walking half a step behind, an obsequious smile on his face. He couldn’t make head nor tail of the situation.

‘What in the world is going on?

‘Wasn’t this person shooed out? Why has he returned? Also, it looks like Jin Xuan personally invited him back?

‘Gasp!

‘This two-faced brat! He was still calling me brother and talking about how we should look after each other just then, yet he’s turned around and betrayed me straight away! What a shameless person!’

There was a dark expression on Xie Donglai’s face. He humphed, and said, “Brother Jin, I need an explanation.”

Jin Xuan was caught in an awkward position. He didn’t want to offend Xie Donglai!

However, there was animosity between Ling Han and Xie Donglai, and he could only choose to side with one of them. If he tried to please both of them, he would only end up pleasing neither. He gritted his teeth as he reached a decision. Xie Donglai had caught him with Ling Han already, so he might as well offend him all the way.

“Heh, what is there to explain?” he asked. “Am I acquainted with Heir Xie in any way?”

‘Heir Xie?’

Xie Donglai involuntarily raised his brows. ‘He’s drawn the line between us so soon? Very well... Very well!’

He was both infuriated and curious. Jin Xuan definitely wouldn’t jeopardize their relationship for nothing. People like him would only betray others if there were benefits to be gained. By the looks of it, Ling Han probably had an influential background.

However, what was his background? It was actually more impressive than his identity as Great General Xie’s descendant? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His expression became solemn as he looked at Ling Han. As an important junior of the Xie Clan, he wasn’t only a talented cultivator. He was also extremely intelligent and skilled at conducting himself.

“Sir, who in the world are you?” he asked.

Jin Xuan immediately interrupted, saying, “He’s Ling Han, Young Master Han! Young Master Han is a Level Eight alchemist!”

In regards to the Realm Spirit Stone, Ling Han was merely the seller. Thus, this wouldn’t elevate his status. However, his identity as a Level Eight alchemist was completely different. This was incredible!

“Oh?” Xie Donglai’s expression changed slightly. This person had become a Level Eight alchemist at such a young age?

Alchemists enjoyed a transcendent status, and they were held in higher regard than cultivators at an equivalent level. He was a cultivation prodigy, though, so he didn’t need to pay to much heed to alchemists at an equivalent level. However, Ling Han was an alchemy prodigy as well, and such kinds of prodigies were even rarer. Thus, he would naturally be held in even higher regard.

There was no shortage of cultivation prodigies in the world—they would appear quite frequently. However, alchemy and tool refinement were different. One needed to accumulate numerous years of experience before they could level up. As such, it was extremely difficult for prodigies to appear in such fields.

‘No wonder Jin Xuan betrayed me to follow him. However, doesn’t he know that I’m more than just a cultivation prodigy? Doesn’t he know that I’m Great General Xie’s descendent?

‘I have the support of an Eternal River Tier elite!

‘Anyhow, why does the name Ling Han sound so familiar?’

“Oh, so you’re an alchemist,” Xie Donglai said with a cold chuckle. However, as arrogant as he was, he still didn’t dare to mock him. The alchemist community wielded huge power, and he would probably be scolded by his clan if he dared to offend them for no good reason. In fact, he might even be banished.

“Good dogs don’t block the path,” Ling Han said calmly.

Xie Donglai was stunned. ‘You actually dared to call me a dog?!’

However, he was indeed standing in the middle of the path and obstructing Ling Han and Jin Xuan. Ling Han wasn’t wrong in this aspect, but the phrase that he used was quite over the top.

“Grandmaster Ling, you’re also here for the Realm Spirit Stone, am I correct?” Xie Donglai decided to change the topic. The question of Ling Han’s identity as an alchemist was quite sensitive, and it was best not to get into a commotion with him in public. Instead, he would secretly kill him when no one was around. That would put things right once and for all.

He was a Level Eight alchemist, and he had hurried over to attend this auction. Thus, there was a 99% chance that he was here for the palm-sized Realm Spirit Stone. That was a precious treasure that could help one comprehend dao!

Heh, in terms of wealth, this young Level Eight alchemist was definitely no match for him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “So what?”

“Haha, with me present, it’s best that you give up now!” Xie Donglai said arrogantly. “Once I bid, the Realm Spirit Stone will be as good as mine!”

Right now, he could only attack Ling Han in such kind of way.

Pu!

Jin Xuan almost burst into laughter. However, he hurriedly covered his mouth with his hands.

‘You still don’t know, do you? The seller of that Realm Spirit Stone is none other than Ling Han. The harder you fight for it, the more money you’re gifting him!’

He had seen rich fools in the past, but he had never seen such a smug one before! Xie Donglai was feeling far too good about himself.

Ling Han remained calm, and said, “Not necessarily. Dumb c*nt, are you sure that you possess such wealth?”

‘Dumb c*nt?’

Xie Donglai’s face twitched when he heard this. Ling Han had called him a dog just then, and now he was calling him a c*nt. How detestable!

‘You can’t stay in Wolf Fang City forever,’ he said coldly in his mind. ‘Once you leave... it’ll be the day of your death!’

He decided that he would triumphantly show the Realm Spirit Stone to Ling Han once he successfully bid on it. He would rub it in the bastard’s face.

With this thought in mind, he stepped back into his private room to let Ling Han and Jin Xuan pass.

Ling Han strode past. When he passed the door, he remarked, “You know when to advance and when to retreat. I guess you can qualify as a good dog.”

‘F*ck!’

Xie Donglai almost drew his saber and attacked. Fortunately, the two elders in the room forcefully held him back. Otherwise, there was no way he could have contained himself.

As a descendent of the Xie Clan, he had already developed a habit of acting on his whim, yet he was unable to kill just a single person at this moment. This made him feel extremely stifled.

‘I’m definitely going to kill that brat!’ he said in his mind.

‘After that, I’ll return to the Imperial Capital and ask Great General Xie to help me get the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. That b*tch actually dared to escape our marriage! Humph! Just you wait!’
