Chapter 1502 Number One in the Rankings, Blood Crow Formation!

He actually dared to face Senior Brother Yan Qing head-on?

Where did he get his courage from!?

Senior Brother Yan Qing was a rank two king tier, and was presently standing at the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Even if Ling Han was a rank three king tier, so what? There was a gap of a whole three minor levels between them. How could this gap be compensated by the difference between rank two and rank three king tier?

If Ling Han had immediately broken into a run, with both of them being in the Eternal River Tier and having about the same speed, Yan Qing really might not be able to stop Ling Han. But in an upfront confrontation, hoho, hohohoho.

He was asking to be humiliated!

The large palm pressed down as if the heavens themselves were falling down.

The blood crow rushed forth, its feathers of blood shooting out like arrows.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu. The blood feathers first landed on the large hand, and they could see that the frightening giant hand immediately began crumbling, and the might of the blood feathers was not reduced. They continued on their trajectory and shot towards Yan Qing.

‘What?!’

Seeing this scene, the other seniors were all dumbfounded.

This, this, this, this... What was going on here!?

Yan Qing also experienced a shock. He hurriedly waved both hands, striking back at these blood feathers.

“Green River Formation!” he shouted loudly. All the bones in his body glowed, and a ray of green light surged forth from his forehead, becoming a huge formation around him.

It was natural that all the disciples of the eighth campus could use themselves as formations.

Green River Formation, a Level 15 formation. It could be ranked in the top 10 of the Level 15 formations, but only managed to be the 10th, neither in the top five nor the top three. It was not that Yan Qing did not want to inscribe a stronger one, but his body could not support a stronger formation.

But the grade of the Green River Formation was also frighteningly high. An ordinary cultivator in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier would only be able to inscribe a killing formation after the top 50, and would thus be no match for him.

“Heavens, Senior Brother Yan was actually forced into using the Green River Formation!”

“This little junior brother is really too nature-defying, he has forced Senior Brother Yan to such an extent with a single move.”

“However, it could only get so far. The Green River Formation can be ranked among the top 10 Level 15 formations. Once this formation is used, only those few senior brothers in the consummate level will be able to put up a fight.”

“That’s indeed the case. Those top 10 killing formations are actually in no way inferior to the lower-ranked killing formations in Level 16.”

Everyone was shaking their head, naturally thinking that Ling Han was definitely going to lose.

Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were filled with confidence. They knew that Ling Han had inscribed the Blood Crow Formation, and what grade was that formation?

It was the number one killing formation among Level 15 formations, and there was no argument about it, either!

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu. The blood feathers hit, yet were unable to penetrate the defenses of the Green River Formation and snapped.

This was within everyone’s expectations. It would have been strange if they had been able to break through the defense. Even Yan Qing revealed a sliver of pride in his expression, and thought that maybe he had been too anxious, and made too much of a fuss?

No matter what, Ling Han’s cultivation level was clearly obvious.

But in the next instant, his expression changed drastically.

The blood crow attacked, and merely with a swipe of its beak, a hole was ripped in the Green River Formation. It flew in directly as if nothing was standing in its way.

‘This...!’

Yan Qing quickly circulated his formation, and infused his own Origin Power, wanting to disperse this blow.

But it was as if the blood crow could not be affected by anything. Whatever attack he blasted out immediately turned into ash. With a flap of its wings, it had already shot to right in front of him.

Peng!

Yan Qing was immediately sent flying out, and spat out a mouthful of blood as he flew through the air. it was like a blood-colored rainbow, incredibly sad and beautiful.

Pa, he landed on the ground.

A dead silence fell.

Everyone was deeply stunned. Had Ling Han gotten extremely excited or taken some kind of drug? He was a little too powerful, wasn’t he.

Yan Qing got to his feet with clenched teeth. His face did not bear any shame of having lost to a junior. Instead, he pointed at Ling Han, his face filled with astonishment. “Blood Crow Formation, you have inscribed the Blood Crow Formation!”

Pu!

Suddenly, a great many people spluttered. The initially dead silence was immediately broken as everyone exclaimed in surprise, their expressions filled with disbelief.

“Blood Crow Formation? The number one of Level 15 formations, the Blood Crow Formation? Impossible!”

“I don’t believe it, either!”

“Even Senior Brother Ren Feiyun only managed to inscribe the number seven formation, Fire Phoenix Red Clouds Formation, when he had been in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier!”

“Senior Brother Cai Miao inscribed the number eight formation, the Black Tortoise Golden Sun Formation.”

“Senior Brother Qi Tian is extraordinarily talented and has a unique physique, so he inscribed the number six formation, the Ice Silkworm Black Destruction Formation.”

“Even the most awesome Senior Sister Yu only managed to inscribe the number five formation, White Tiger Six Dao Formation.”

“It is said that it is impossible for the top three killing formations to be inscribed in one’s body, as the body could not possibly support them.”

Everyone was grabbing their heads, filled with disbelief, and not daring to believe, either.

“Junior Brother Ling, that... is that the Blood Crow Formation?” Yan Qing only wanted to confirm that point.

Since Ling Han had used this move, even if he didn’t say now, it would be deduced by others in future. Thus, Ling Han nodded, and replied, “That’s right.”

‘It really is... the Blood Crow Formation!’

This was too nature-defying; someone actually managed to succeed!

“Hold on!” Someone suddenly stared with wide eyes. “He, he is only in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier!”

“Gasp!”

A small stone gave rise to waves. Previously, everyone was only stunned by the fact that someone managed to inscribe the Blood Crow Formation, and was shaken by this unbelievable fact. But with such a reminder now, they realized something even more frightening. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han was only in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier in the first place, and ordinarily, he should only be able to inscribe a Level 13 formation.

‘Damn, do you have to be so incredibly awesome?’

Everyone’s mouth was wide open, their tongue sticking out. Only with this could they somewhat express the astonishment they were presently feeling. Even throwing out 10,000 curses would not be able to appease their wildly throbbing heartbeat.

If you f******** really reached the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, wouldn’t you be able to inscribe a Saint-level formation?

However, they had thought too much with that. Firstly, the gap to the Saint-level was too big. Only if Ling Han had cultivated to the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier would he be able to boost the strength of his Godly bones up to Saint level. Secondly, a Saint-level formation needed one to have a grasp of corresponding Regulations of heaven and earth, and that would need a Saint’s cultivation level. Even if Ling Han cultivated Godly bones equivalent to Divine Metal, it would still be useless.

But precisely because they did not know it, they were even more stunned. Because going by that deduction... when Ling Han advanced into the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, he might be able to kill even Saints.

Ling Han looked at all the seniors that had turned to stone. He snapped his fingers, and prompted, “Wives, let’s go.”

The Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden walked on either side of him. Ling Han was content. This was much more impressive than how he had blasted Yan Qing into defeat previously.

After they exited the academy, Ling Han drew out the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. However, this could only accommodate two people. Thus, Empress Luan Xing entered first into the Black Tower, allowing a chance for Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to have a “heart-to-heart chat”.

This wife was really understanding and incredibly considerate.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden chatted and chatted to the extent that their clothes were dispensed with. Though the space inside the Cloud Piercing Shuttle was not large, and they couldn’t really stretch their arms and legs too far, being small had its benefits as well. It provided a different kind of excitement.

At the climax of her passion, as she bit onto Ling Han’s shoulder, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden murmured, “I want to birth a child for you!”

“That would take a few more times,” Ling Han said seriously, and began the second and then third round. Since his wife had made a request of him, he naturally had to do his utmost and work hard on sowing his seed.

Being lovey-dovey and hands-on with each other, they didn’t feel that time had passed too slowly. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed. The Cloud Piercing Shuttle stopped, having arrived at the assigned galactic coordinates.

“This place... Why is there nothing here!?”
