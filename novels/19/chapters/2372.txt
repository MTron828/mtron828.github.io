Chapter 2373: Battling Hong Huang again Translations

“Congratulations, my friend. There is a chance that you will take the second step,” the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le nodded, and said, “I have heard this brat speak of you. Furthermore, I, too, have to thank you. Without your Heavenly Venerate Tool, it would not have been possible for me to escape, either.” He did not use a respectful address for himself, giving the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable enough face.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable looked towards Ling Han, and revealed a smile. Actually, he had always been paying attention to this disciple, but there was never a time that required his interference, and it wasn’t right until this instant that he finally showed himself. Not only had he resolved all of Ling Han’s future worries, he had even found a great backer for him.

He was also very gratified. This disciple that was separated from him by generations had hopes of surpassing himself. He felt very relieved, being able to delegate the responsibility for the future to Ling Han.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then bowed. “Greetings, Master.”

Since he started cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he had formed a relationship of master and disciple with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, even if they were separated by generations.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable nodded. “In the future, you can only depend on yourself. To awaken me, the Tower of Three Realms has also exercised its remaining might. From now onwards, it will sink into slumber… unless you yourself can attain Heavenly Venerable Tier—only then will you be able to revive it.”

Ling Han nodded. “I will definitely achieve it.”

“You are very good, very good,” the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable said. There was a limited amount of time for him to manifest. In the future, he would rejoin the Heavenly Dao. Though he could be considered as still existing, no one could know, and it would be eternally impossible for him to make any sound.

Fusing himself with Heavenly Dao was equivalent to devoting himself to Heavenly Dao, so it was naturally impossible for him to have any individual existence.

“Heavenly Venerate!” The large black dog raced over, howling at the skies.

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable looked at the large black dog with a smile, and said, “Little Black, assist Ling Han well in the future.”

“Don’t worry!” The large black dog stood on its hindlegs as he slung an arm around Ling Han’s shoulders. “I have been taking care of him all this while, and would always invite him in if there was anything good.”

Ling Han almost sent a kick over. Aside from screwing others over, what else had this damn dog done?

“I am leaving. In the future, you all will have to walk the path ahead on your own,” the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable said, his figure becoming dimmer and dimmer.

“Respectful farewell, milord!” Practically everyone knelt down. They had all heard of the past achievements of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. He had fused himself with Heavenly Realm, and crashed himself into the connecting point of the two realms, winning a considerable number of epochs of peace for the Celestial Realm.

This kind of great feat naturally deserved respect.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable smiled, his figure gradually becoming fainter as he returned to the heaven and earth.

Weng, a black tower descended, yet it had lost all its luster.

“Heavenly Venerate…” the large black dog wept horribly. Usually, he did not act the slightest bit proper, yet it was only now that he revealed his genuine temperament.

“Farewell, friend,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le said as well. Though heavenly tribulation was fearful, he did not care in the slightest. He was about to cultivate the first tier to consummate level. His strength was incredibly high, and just a thought could smash the lightning giants that assailed him into bits.

As long as he did not take any direct actions which would cause the targeting from the heaven and earth to become even more frightening, he was definitely indestructible and immortal.

He looked towards Ling Han again, clapping his shoulder, and said, “Brat, you have to walk the path on your own, and there is no way that I will pave the way for you, either. Moreover, only a path that you have walked yourself will be wide enough, and you will be able to walk farther.

“If there isn’t anything pressing, don’t seek me out, but if anyone dares to bully you with their superior strength, I will not spare him, either!”

Ling Han nodded. He, too, had no intention to depend on anyone. As long as their cultivation levels were close, what need would he have to fear anyone?

“That’s right!” Just moments ago, the large black dog was crying so badly, but the rate of his recovery was also dementedly fast. He had actually clapped a paw on Ling Han’s shoulder, cheekily grinning, and said, “Brat, did you hear that? In the future, you are to run your own course!”

He paused, and then said shamelessly to Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, “Milord, in the future, just shelter me. Grandpa Dog is 100 times more handsome, with talent 10,000 times greater than this brat’s. Really, you would not be able to find anyone better.”

“Scram!” Faced with the large black dog’s shamelessness, even Heavenly Venerate Wu Le could not help but raise his foot and send him a kick.

Thankfully, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was not really angered. Otherwise, if he really kicked solidly, the large black dog could just say goodbye to this world.

“That’s it, then.” With a wave of his sleeve, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le took a step, and was already boundlessly far away.

He had been away from the Celestial Realm for over a dozen epochs, so he naturally wanted to roam around everywhere.

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

“Ling Han!”

A group of youths walked over, gathering around Ling Han. In the past, when Ling Han had shown his great might, killing over 100 Ancestral Kings through trickery, it had practically been a blinding feat. However, they had not managed to interact with him in time when he had already been forced to flee into the Foreign Realm.

“I anticipate another battle with you,” Ji Wuming said as he stood in the distance, arms crossed behind his back.

“Humph!” Hong Huang’s eyes were seeping with menace. If the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had not announced that anyone who was superior to Ling Han by more than two minor levels could not make a move, he would definitely have killed Ling Han by now.

It should be known that he had “died” in Ling Han’s hands once. If it were not for the fact that the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had heaven-defying power, the grass growing on his grave would already be a foot tall by now.

…Ling Han had returned to the Celestial Realm, and his cultivation level had directly fallen to the Second Secret Immortal Palace Tier, just like how he had been when he had left. However, he had actually converted a portion of his Origin Power into Source Power, so he could be considered an Ascending Origin Tier as well. Yet how this cultivation level should be calculated now became a problem.

But the aura he revealed now was truly just at the Immortal Palace Tier. Thus, Hong Huang, who had already advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier, naturally could not attack him.

Ling Han looked over, and asked, “You are not dead?”

Hong Huang’s expression became livid, yet he only humphed, and did not reply.

“Then I will send you to the underworld once again!” Ling Han brandished a fist. His cultivation level was hard to determine, but his Body Art would not be influenced by the Regulations. He still had battle prowess that surpassed the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier.

“I can’t be bothered to fight you,” Hong Huang scoffed.

“Don’t worry. Since it was I that issued the challenge, Lord Wu Le would not make trouble for you even if I truly died in battle.” Ling Han laughed. “How about it? Do you dare to battle me?”

Hong Huang’s heart was moved. Even if he could not kill Ling Han, he could still cruelly humiliate the latter. This was what Ling Han had invited, wasn’t it?

Thinking of this, he nodded, and said, “Since you are so determined to ask for your own humiliation, I shall oblige you!” He had already advanced into the Ascending Origin Tier. Though he was only at Small Accomplishment, it was naturally easily done if he wanted to suppress a mere Immortal Palace Tier.

“Fourth Brother, why don’t you let me?” the Rain Emperor spoke up. Though he had had a late start, he was now in the lead as he, too, had successfully advanced into the Ascending Origin Tier.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I can deal with this kind of trash on my own. There is no need to trouble you, Second Brother.”

“All right.” The Rain Emperor nodded. He believed that Ling Han would not do anything that he was not certain that he could accomplish. Since Ling Han was so sure of himself, he had to have absolute certainty in his chances of victory.

“It will not take a few— I’ll be done soon. Second Brother, please wait a while, and we will have a proper reunion,” Ling Han said smilingly. At first, he had wanted to say a few seconds, but remembering that there was no way the Rain Emperor knew of the concept of minutes and seconds, he changed his words.

“Ling Han, you are too condescending,” Hong Huang stated coldly. He was incredibly furious, wanting nothing more than to tear Ling Han to pieces.

Ling Han crooked a finger at him. “Within three moves, I will teach you how to behave.”

“Enough!” Hong Huang roared, his voice turning into a massive mountain-splitting ax that struck down on Ling Han.

“The first move!” Ling Han said smilingly as he casually threw a punch. His fist landed on the giant ax, and a terrifying power surged out.?Peng, this massive ax was immediately shattered into smithereens, and the power of the punch was not reduced in the slightest, still blasting towards Hong Huang.

Hong Huang’s eyes immediately bulged as he was completely incapable of believing what he was seeing.
