Chapter 1101: Surpassing the Legends

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everyone clutched their heads and exclaimed in surprise. This was far too astonishing! Wasn’t Xia Wuque struggling to take another step forward? Yet, Ling Han was actually increasing his speed at this moment!

“Humph!” Xia Wuque clenched his fists as killing intent exuding from his body.

“This person is indeed impressive. He’s worth befriending,” Su Jing said calmly. He could naturally sense the killing intent that Xia Wuque had toward Ling Han. However, he didn’t care!

He believed that he was peerless, and his background was also top-notch. Thus, what did he need to be afraid of?

Shao Sisi was extremely beautiful, and she said smilingly, “I’ve long heard of Brother Su’s name. It’s my honor to meet you today!”

Although Su Jing had strong willpower, his heart still fluttered when he saw Shao Sisi’s breathtaking beauty. He hurriedly clasped his hands in respect, and said, “I’ve also long heard of Lady Sisi’s name. It’s a shame that I was never able to meet you before.”

“Hehe, if all goes according to plan, we’ll meet again at the Majestic Heaven Sect, where we’ll become fellow students,” Du An said. His gaze swept across Ling Han, and he lightly flicked his fingers, saying, “At that time, who knows what level this person will have reached?”

Su Jing and Shao Sisi both nodded, an expectant look on their faces.

In terms of battle prowess alone, they definitely had a crushing advantage over Ling Han. However, this was because Ling Han’s cultivation level was far below theirs. Once he reached the same level as them, it was likely that their battle prowess would be hard to differentiate. Even if theirs was still stronger, they would still have no way to deal with Ling Han’s physique and recovery ability.

Su Jing shook his head after mulling over this for a moment, and said, “Other than defeating him in one blow, there’s truly no other method. Otherwise, one will be exhausted to death by him!” He felt that there was no way to deal with Ling Han’s defenses.

“He’s merely a lowly commoner from a small world; there’s no need to hold him in such high regard!” Xia Wuque said. His face was still filled with disdain.

“Heh.” Shao Sisi and the two others merely gave an indifferent chuckle, not bothering to reply.

Xia Wuque already hated Ling Han with passion. With this preconception, how could he assess things fairly? As such, there was no need to listen to him.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was flying through the formation.

The destructive ability of the stone statues had already reached four stars above the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. Ling Han would definitely be wounded whenever he was struck by their attacks, and these wounds were quite heavy as well. Thus, he didn’t dare to slow down, and did his best to minimize the amount of damage that he suffered.

Even so, he was still struck frequently, causing his body to become riddled with wounds.

If it were someone else, they would have definitely died after suffering so many strikes. However, Ling Han was barely affected. The stone statues could continue to attack him, and he would continue to charge through the formation.

Everyone was speechless upon seeing this. How could such a freakish person exist? ‘Are you really a human? Are you sure you’re not a puppet forged from Godly metal?’

Ninth stage!

This stage was even more terrifying as the destructive ability of the stone statues had risen by another star. A bloody hole would appear in Ling Han’s body every time he was struck by their fists. In fact, even his Godly bones were groaning.

The expressions of Xia Wuque and the three others changed drastically. Their battle prowess was still above these stone statues, yet they would definitely be wounded if they were to be hit by their attacks. Apart from freaks like Ling Han, the large majority of people had far stronger offensive abilities than defensive abilities. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Didn’t the saying go, offense was the strongest defense?

“With our strength, we’ll still be able to suppress the stone statues of this stage. As for the next stage...” They didn’t continue this sentence.

At the next stage, every single stone statue would have a destructive ability that was on par with theirs, so what would it be like if hundreds upon thousands of these stone statues attacked them together?

If it were a one-on-one battle, they believed that they would still win. In fact, they would be confident even if it were a one-on-ten battle. After all, these stone statues were only puppets. Each was like a child wielding a supreme God Tool—the threat it posed was indeed great, yet one could still achieve a steady victory as long as they dealt with the matter carefully.

However, once the number of stone statues increased to what they saw in the stone statue formation, there was simply no way to achieve victory.

“Although we’re six-star geniuses, we can only admit defeat when faced with the last stage!”

“Don’t tell me one genuinely has to raise their physique and recovery ability to such an incredible level in order to pass.”

Shao Sisi pondered for a moment before saying, “Have you guys heard about the existence of eight or even nine-star geniuses in the distant galaxies?”

Su Jing nodded, and said, “I’ve indeed heard of these rumors. However, so what? I’ve already raised each of my cultivation levels to perfection, yet my power is still only six stars. Taking into account some secret techniques, I can wield a battle prowess of seven stars. However, eight stars? That’s hard to imagine!”

“Don’t forget that five-star geniuses are already considered to be legends in our galaxy.” A meaningful smile appeared on Shao Sisi’s face, and she said, “Since we’ve already surpassed the legends, this proves that the legends are completely realizable. Thus, it won’t be surprising if eight or nine-star geniuses genuinely exist.”

“This...!” Su Jing and Du An were both stunned. They were already supreme prodigies who stood at the summit of the younger generation. However, they were unable to imagine how they could take another step forward.

Du An’s heart shuddered, and he said, “Could that legend also be...?”

Su Jing involuntarily exclaimed in surprise, and asked, “Huh, you’ve also heard of that legend?”

Xia Wuque finally joined in on their conversation begrudgingly, saying, “Humph! Are you talking about the fifth Mountain and River? What a joke! The Mountain River Tier only has four minor tiers, and this is the unbreakable law of cultivation. How can one possibly form a fifth Mountain and River?”

Shao Sisi agreed with his viewpoint, and said, “Indeed. We should be the most powerful prodigies in the world. Moreover, we opened the sky from a small world, and we’ve also raised each cultivation level to perfection. However, I’ve found that my four Mountains and Rivers have formed an extremely stable state. It’s absolutely impossible to form a new Mountain and River.”

Su Jing and Du An both nodded in agreement. They had naturally attempted to form a new Mountain and River and become a legendary prodigy after hearing of the rumors. However, they saw no hope for success.

Most importantly, this was only a rumor, so they had been extremely unsure themselves. Perhaps it was an impossible task to begin with? This caused their willpower to waver—should they really put all of their efforts into this?

If this were genuinely just a rumor, they would suffer far too great of a loss.

“However, I believe that it’s possible to form five Mountains and Rivers now!” Shao Sisi’s eyes glimmered with intelligence, and she said, “Otherwise, this stone statue formation is absolutely impossible to pass!”

Su Jing nodded in agreement, and said, “That’s right. If one forms another Mountain and River, they’ll be able to possess a battle prowess on par with pseudo-Sun Moon Tier elites even though they haven’t actually reached the Sun Moon Tier yet. In that case, there’s definitely hope of passing this formation.”

“Great minds think alike! I’m definitely going to form five Mountains and Rivers! If I don’t succeed, I won’t break through to the Sun Moon Tier!” Du An, who was brimming with confidence, continued, “I’ll either be a prodigy at the summit of cultivators, or I’ll die trying!”

“Agreed!” Shao Sisi and Su Jing both nodded seriously. It was a rare delight to find others with similar aspirations on the path to the summit of cultivation. They weren’t lonely!

Xia Wuque wore a look of indifference. However, thoughts swirled through his mind. He had to admit that forming five Mountains and Rivers was the best method to pass this formation. Ling Han was probably using some other “crooked method”—who else possessed such a freakish physique and recovery ability?

He watched on in jealousy as Ling Han sped through the ninth stage and headed into the final stage.
