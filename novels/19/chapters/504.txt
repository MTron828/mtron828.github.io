Chapter 505: The Matter Wasn’t Settled

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han rejected Zhu Xuan Er and said, “Your injury hasn’t healed, go back to rest first.”

Zhu Xuan Er had just said something that made her embarrassed to the point that her entire body was burning hot and was now stupefied. If Ling Han took advantage and pushed her down, then they would experience the most intimate contact; she would then not have to be reserved in front of Ling Han, but now she couldn’t even open her eyes, scramming hurriedly.

“Sigh, such an exceptional beauty threw herself into my arms, I actually didn’t take it!” Ling Han lay on the grass, looking at the sky without stars and moon. “Does my brain have a problem, to think of that savage woman at such a time!”

Then, Ling han sat up abruptly, face twitching. “Hiss, could I have actually fallen for that meddling woman?

“Otherwise, under those circumstances, which man would reject it? I don’t have a freaking wife, so it doesn’t matter which woman I’m with, right? No matter whether it was Liu Yu Tong or Li Si Chan, why was it that I’ve never thought of touching them?

“It’s over, it’s over, it’s already been a millennium, and I suddenly realized that I fell for that savage lady!

“How come?

“Other than looking prettier than most, being stronger than most, having martial talent greater than most, and having a physique better than most, she didn’t seem to have any more merits. The key is savage, subduing my four disciples, and coming to my place to sweep out the medicinal pills from time to time. She never treated herself as an outsider. I’ve truly never seen such a rogue woman!

“What!?”

Ling Han’s expression was strange. Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden behaved like she was the mistress—could it be, could it be!?

“I’m such an idiot!” he yelled out towards the sky.

Small Tower appeared and said to him indifferently, “You certainly are an idiot.”

“I only spoke thoughtlessly. Someone incomparably smart like me is million miles away from stupid!” Ling Han immediately returned to his carefree attitude as he didn’t want others to know what weighed on his mind.

“You can’t hide from me. In the past millennium, I preserved your soul, and your memories in those years were all clearly seen by me.” Small Tower still insipid.

“Hey, hey, hey, is it really good for you to spy on people’s privacy?” Ling Han wanted to punch someone.

“You think I wanted to look?” Small Tower said coldly, paused, then went on, “Its clear, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was interested in you, but you bonehead didn’t realize at all!”

Since Small Tower knew, Ling Han pretended no longer, sighing, and said, “That savage woman was so domineering, if she liked me, just say so... not gentle at all!”

However, he immediately shook his head. Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, one of the seven Heaven Tier elites in his previous life, the beautiful battle goddess who was second to Sword Emperor, the super genius, how could she possibly affectedly ingratiate herself with a man like a normal woman would?

If it truly were like that, then would that still be Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden?

“Your gentleness, I really don’t understand!” Ling Han muttered, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden ran over to his place from time to time and grabbed things left and right, not acting like an outsider at all; this was actually an obvious hint.

Unfortunately, he was too proud back then, and all he wanted to do was cross into the Shattering Void Tier to suppress that savage woman. If he took a step back, maybe Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden would also relinquish her haughty airs, and the two would already have been together.

Now, they were separated by a millennium!

“Even Jiang Yue Feng, that attention-seeker, became a god. With Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s talents, she definitely also broke the void and became a god... and once one’s a god, while perhaps one’s lifespan wouldn’t be infinite, living for several tens of thousands of years shouldn’t be a problem.”

Ling Han immediately clenched his fist. “Wait till I break the void and become a god, I’ll definitely come find you! You savage woman, if you dare marry another man, then I’ll really be done with you!”

The carriage rocked, and spent seven days to return to Extreme Yang City.

Ling Han immediately had Li Si Chan, Liu Yu Tong, and the others leave for Not Forget and Alchemist King Pavilion to take back the Origin Crystals earned in these few days. This was the truly useful thing—silver didn’t matter.

He personally went to the North Pill Pavilion to find Gongyang Tai Sun. He had to pick up his mother and return to Rain Country to reunite with his father.

Alchemists devoted heart and soul to refining pills, even giving up the quotas for Twelve Heaven Mystery Realm. Although part of the reason was because they were no match for martial artists, this group was certainly indifferent to martial arts, so there were also few elites among them.

For example, amongst the alchemists of North Pill Pavilion, only one reached the Spiritual Infant Tier, and it was precisely Gongyan Tai Sun.

Ling Han believed that Gongyang Tai Sun would definitely revere his title of Heaven Grade alchemist, and not want to obtain the Twelve Palace’s legacy from him. Of course, he didn’t completely trust someone he didn’t know quite well. Anyway, with the Black Tower, he could escape safely under the worst circumstances. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After arriving at the North Pill Pavilion, he showed everyone his original looks.

“Respects for Master Ling!” On his path, all alchemists paid their respects.

Ling Han slightly nodded in response, and soon came to Gongyang Tai Sun’s private house. And when the Gongyang Tai Sun received news, he also came greeting immediately.

“Master Han, this old one is useless, and couldn’t settle the matter!” Gong Yang Tai Sun told Ling Han who was to blame.

An ominous feeling surged within Ling Han as he said with a frown, “What happened?”

“The Winter Moon Sect won’t let her go!” Gong Yang Tai Sun said furiously. With a Heaven Grade alchemist’s order on paper and in addition to him, a medium level Earth Grade alchemist, making a trip, he actually couldn’t get anyone—even he was extremely annoyed.

Ling Han stroked his chin—could Winter Moon Sect think of threatening him with his mother?

It was impossible for the Winter Moon Sect to know Ling Han’s relationship with Yue Hong Chang, but anyone would find it strange a Heaven Grade alchemist demanded a sinner of Winter Moon Sect. More importantly, north region wasn’t the middle state. Here, a Heaven Grade alchemist was actually no different from a medium level Earth Grade alchemist.

If Spiritual Infant Tier warriors truly didn’t give face, what could you do? Summon a Deity Transformation Tier to suppress them?

Just like in the middle state—Yao Hui Yue and the disciples of such super-sects actually didn’t respect alchemists a single bit.

“I know.” Ling Han nodded. Apparently, he’d have to personally go over to the Winter Moon Sect.

“Master Han, this old one will accompany on your trip,” Gongyang Tai Sun said worriedly; obviously, he’d already heard that Ling Han acquired the Twelve Palace’s legacy, and feared that the Winter Moon Sect might resort to violence.

“No need, I have my own strategy,” Ling Han said smilingly.

He left the North Pill Pavilion and returned to his dwellings. Liu Yu Tong and the others returned one after another, bringing bad news.

Both places had been destroyed.

No one knew who’d done it, but after the shop closed at night, once the door opened the second day, there would be corpses inside. With the stench of corpses filling the air, who would still want to eat or buy medicine?

The Thousand Corpse Sect.

A dignified large sect actually used such lowly tactics, truly lacking in class.

“Is this trying to make me uncomfortable?” Ling Han muttered. Fortunately, these two properties only brought in a stable income for Ling Han. What truly allowed him to get rich quick was auctioning medicinal pills, so this couldn’t harm him seriously.

“Forget about this. I’ve now acquired the Twelve Palace’s legacy, and my background will soon be dug out bit by bit, so I must save mother as soon as possible and then bring father out of Rain Country. Can’t let others have a hold on me.

“To the Winter Moon Sect!”
