Chapter 1014: Catastrophe Caused by Demonic Snakes

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When cultivators fought, they usually used their hands or feet. Otherwise, they would use some sort of weapon. Only a very, very small minority would choose to practice peculiar techniques such as Iron Head and so on.

However, apart from Hu Niu in the past, perhaps this youth was the only other person who used his mouth as a weapon.

Fu Tian’s fighting style was almost a replica of Hu Niu’s. However, he was even more vicious, with his steel-like hands being able to easily rip through his opponent’s defenses. He would tear their intestines out and crush their throat with his mouth. In fact, he would attack in whatever manner as long as it could kill the enemy. He truly took full advantage of all his body parts.

This was, of course, a result of him training intensely. He had most likely experienced countless similar battles, and such attacks had perhaps already become a natural instinct to him. Once he started fighting, his body would naturally move according to these ingrained instincts.

‘Where on earth did this youth come from?’

“Retreat! Retreat!” The pirates couldn’t endure the attacks any longer. 60 of them had boarded this ship, yet only less than 20 of them still remained standing. They had undoubtedly suffered a heavy loss. Most importantly, they were still unable to capture this ship after losing so many companions.

“None of you shall escape!” Yang Tiecheng humphed coldly. He unleashed his full battle prowess as he charged from one end of the ship to the other. He was determined not to let a single pirate escape.

Peng!

At this moment, the ship suddenly shuddered violently, and almost capsized.

The people on the ship all stumbled and stopped their battles. What was going on?

“Not good!”

The expressions of Yang Tiecheng and a few pirates changed drastically as they peered into the distance.

Judging by their shocked and terrified expressions, they had definitely come across grave danger.

Ling Han activated his Eye of Truth and also peered into the distance. He saw hundreds of giant snakes swimming over, each measuring over 30 meters in length and having a body as thick as a barrel. Green patterns adorned their bodies.

“Green-patterned Demonic Snakes!” a sailor yelped.

It was a type of Demonic Beast unique to the Star Sea. They were descendants of the Demonic Snake, and were a type of social Demonic Beast. Each nest would have at least several hundred mature snakes at the Mountain River Tier. When coming across such Demonic Beasts, the only option for small-sized ships was to escape.

Peng!

The ship shuddered again, and it suddenly tilted to the left. It was already on the verge of capsizing.

“Humph!” Yang Tiecheng leaped toward the right of the ship and heavily stomped down. The ship shuddered violently, and the momentum of the tilt was instantly halted. Then, the ship started to tilt the other way.

At the same time, there was a gigantic snake ramming the ship from underneath, trying to capsize it.

If the cultivators fell into the water, their battle prowess would definitely take a huge hit.

After reaching the Immortal level, these Demonic Beasts were as intelligent as humans, and could even shapeshift into human form. Thus, they naturally knew how to maximize their advantages.

Ling Han looked around, only to find that they had already been encircled by the gigantic snakes. These snakes measured over 30 meters in length, and all of them were at the Mountain River Tier, though it was unclear what their specific cultivation level was.

There were also some small snakes that measured only three meters in length, though these snakes lagged a long distance behind their gigantic brethren. Moreover, they were only at the Shattering Void or Heaven Tier.

It was clear that they didn’t have the right to participate in the battle. They could only come over to feast on the flesh of the cultivators after the gigantic snakes finished the fight.

Spiritual Meat was nutritious to cultivators, and on the flip side, the blood essence of cultivators was also nutritious to Demonic Beasts. This was especially the case with Immortal level cultivators, whose blood essence was extremely nutritious to Demonic Beasts at the Shattering Void Tier.

This nest of snakes had probably been attracted by the stench of blood in the sea. They were here to enjoy a hearty meal.

The situation was extremely precarious.

Peng!

The ship continued to rock back and forth as the snake underneath the ship relentlessly tried to capsize them.

Right now, none of them dared to fight among themselves anymore. They stood at the edges of the ship as they used their powers to maintain its balance. If the ship capsized, few of them would be able to survive.

Peng! Peng, peng! Peng, peng, peng!

As if someone were beating gongs, the ship groaned and creaked as it shuddered violently.

“Damn it! These Demonic Snakes are trying to break the ship apart.” Their expressions all changed drastically.

If one were to dive into the sea right now, they would see over 10 snakes spitting pellets of water at the bottom of the ship. These pellets of water would explode upon hitting the bottom of the hull, causing it to rock intensely.

Further below these snakes, there was a gigantic Demonic Snake that measured over 300 meters in length. The patterns on its body had a dim silver luster.

This was the Demonic Snake King, and its cultivation level had already reached the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier. In fact, it even had a chance to break through to the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, the patterns on its body were also different from the other snakes’. It was this snake that had been ramming the ship and trying to capsize it before.

As if it were being lashed by a severe storm, the ship rocked back and forth vigorously. Those who were under the Immortal level were all thrown off their feet and into the sea.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others stood their ground firmly as if their feet were glued to the deck. They remained still no matter how hard the ship rocked or shuddered. However, their expressions were all especially solemn. They all knew that it was only a matter of time before the ship broke apart.

“We’ve already been stuck here for a long time. If we can hold on for two more days, the next ship will catch up to us. It’s a large ship, and there’s a great elite at the Sun Moon Tier guarding it.” Yang Tiecheng tried to raise everyone’s spirits.

If there were a great elite at the Sun Moon Tier, they would be able to slay thousands or even tens of thousands of these snakes, much less a mere several hundred.

The problem was, could they hold on for two more days?

“The ship is falling apart!” Fu Tian suddenly shouted. However, there was no hint of apprehension on his face, only an unyielding fighting spirit.

He was definitely a battle maniac!

Crack!

Sure enough, a loud snapping sound traveled out from the ship. Its keel had been shattered.

They all looked at each other, yet the ship disintegrated with a deafening boom before they could even open their mouths to speak. The ship broke into dozens of pieces.

“Find a piece to stand on!” Yang Tiecheng roared. “Otherwise, you’ll definitely die if you battle while not being able to float!” He was the captain of the ship, so he had to take responsibility for the safety of his sailors and passengers.

Everyone heeded his advice and found various pieces of the ship to stand on.

The pirates also stopped fighting, the 20 or so of them moving to three separate pieces of the wreckage. As for the small ships that they had come on, these had already been obliterated by the Demonic Snakes.

Boom!

A gigantic snake surfaced from the sea and slammed its thick and powerful tail into a group of people who were standing on flotsam.

Unfortunately, Ling Han was on this piece of wreckage.

Fortunately, however, Yang Tiecheng was also on this piece of wreckage!

“F*ck off!” He clenched his fist and swung it at the snake’s tail.

Peng!

The snake’s tail exploded into a cloud of blood, and the excruciating pain made it squirm about and send huge waves surging through the sea.

‘As expected of Yang Tiecheng. So strong!’

“Wife, come closer.” Ling Han’s left arm was wrapped around Shui Yanyu’s slender waist as he held his sword in his right hand. “Us two lovers might die here today, yet you still haven’t told me that you love me yet. You’re not going to let me die with such regret, are you?”

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him. Ling Han was far too good at acting. He clearly had the Black Tower, so even if the others all died, the two of them would still be absolutely safe.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
