Chapter 1307 Chi Huangji“s Power

The Stone Emperor and North Emperor were completely unfazed, and they merely sneered in reply. They were all kings among king tiers, so it had only ever been them telling others to attack them together. How could they gang up on someone themselves?

“Trash, move aside!” Chi Huangji chided softly. He threw a punch that transformed into four bursts of flames and shot toward Faceless, Yang Lin, the Cloud Maiden, and Tuoba Dong. Even his Netherworld companion had become one of his targets.

Faceless and the three others didn’t dare to underestimate this attack. Some of them tried to dodge it, while others tried to block it. In any case, they couldn’t just stand there and do nothing.

Chi Huangji roared with laughter, throwing another punch and then another. The red sun above his head flashed with each punch that he threw as if he were a sun god.

Faceless and the others roared loudly as they tried to withstand Chi Huangji’s attacks. However, Chi Huangji was far too powerful, so they had no choice but to team up to battle against him.

This was an extremely interesting scenario. Three of them were Immortal Realm beings, while one of them was a Netherworld being. Yet, at this moment, they were teaming up to battle against a single Netherworld elite. No matter how one looked at this, it would seem incredibly odd and inharmonious.

However, they were truly left with no choice but to team up. Chi Huangji was far too powerful, so much so that he had already transcended the level of ordinary king tiers and reached the level of a king among king tiers. If this were in the outside world, perhaps they could still use the advantage of their cultivation level to achieve victory. However, this was the Mountain River Forest, so they could only battle against each other at the same cultivation level. As such, they could only rely on a weight of numbers if they wanted to achieve victory.

However, if this battle were truly taken to the outside world, Chi Huangji would be an elite who had already reached the Heavenly Body Tier. That being the case, only the Stone Emperor and North Emperor would be able to battle against him.

“Hahahaha!” Chi Huangji’s black hair hung loosely over his shoulders, and a peculiar image of the galaxy and stars was reflected in his eyes. The red sun above his head flashed as he continued to throw punches at the four king tiers.

The four king tiers didn’t dare to face his attacks head-on, so all they could do was continue to dodge and evade. Meanwhile, they would also launch some counterattacks between his punches. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Useless!” Chi Huangji shouted in disdain. In his eyes, only Ling Han, the North Emperor, and the Stone Emperor were worthy of being his opponents. The other also-rans were only worthy of being swept aside.

However, how could Faceless and the others bring themselves to admit defeat? They all started to unleash their most powerful techniques, embroiling themselves in an intense battle with Chi Huangji.

“Rising clouds, True Dragons appear from the Thousand Peaks!” the Cloud Maiden cried softly. She was the first among them to unleash her most powerful attack. As she spread her hands, numerous azure mountains materialized into existence, all of them shrouded in clouds and mists. Amid this range of azure mountains, the growl of a dragon could be heard. It was as if a True Dragon lay amid these mountains.

True Dragons were beings that soared through the heavens and were feared all over the world.

Weng!

A formidable pressure instantly swept through the surroundings. It was as if this woman were the paragon of the world whom everyone could only regard with awe and veneration.

“Flowing water dying tunes, Thousand Tone Obliteration!” Faceless strummed his guqin frantically, the melody that rose from it as quick as war drums. Everyone’s heart involuntarily beat faster as if about to forcefully expand and explode.

At the same time, bursts of sound waves transformed into flowing water that looked harmless, yet were actually brimming with killing intent. These streams of water flowed toward Chi Huangji.

Meanwhile, Yang Lin retrieved an ancient-looking umbrella[1] that was already severely damaged on one half. This ruined the umbrella’s beauty. In any case, he opened the umbrella, and it suddenly seemed as if he had become the center of the universe. He was especially radiant and eye-catching.

“Eternal sky, I shall be eternal!” he roared. A brilliant glow burst from the ancient umbrella, and then transformed into an ancient buddha that radiated with golden light. The ancient buddha swiped its palm at Chi Huangji.

This was Yang Lin’s damaged Saint Tool. In the outside world, it was even capable of suppressing Heavenly Body Tier elites!

Tuoba Dong gritted his teeth before aggressively striking his own chest. He spat out a mouthful of golden blood, and shouted, “The lion king roars, the world shall prostrate!”

He then unleashed a violent roar.

Pa, pa, pa!

The space surrounding him was shattered as the shock wave of his roar surged toward Chi Huangji.

The four king tiers all unleashed their respective trump cards.

At this moment, even Chi Huangji didn’t dare to underestimate them.

If they were battling one-on-one, he could easily defeat any one of the four king tiers. However, he was being ganged up on at this moment, so his advantage over them was already extremely slim. The four king tiers were more so unleashing their trump cards at him, so the pressure on him was naturally even greater.

If he slipped up, even he would have to suffer a grudging defeat.

“Wonderful, wonderful, things are finally getting more interesting now!”

Chi Huangji laughed loudly as his fighting spirit soared through the sky. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible to battle against four other king tiers at once. Thus, he was extremely excited at this moment.

“However, that’s far from enough to defeat me!”

He threw another punch that was simple yet violent and direct.

Boom!

This wasn’t any normal punch, and it transformed into a sea of boundless flames.

An azure dragon slithered out from the Cloud Maiden’s azure mountain range, and this dragon was the first to near the sea of flames. However, as the azure dragon dashed over, its body was gradually incinerated by the blazing sea of flames. It eventually turned into nothingness after arriving almost one meter before Chi Huangji.

Faceless’ flowing water attack also evaporated over half a meter before Chi Huangji.

Yang Lin’s attack fared better than both the Cloud Maiden’s and Faceless’. His ancient umbrella was a Saint Tool, after all, and the ancient buddha that it transformed into was able to break through the sea of flames and launch a strike at Chi Huangji. However, it was coincidentally met by Chi Huangji’s fist, which easily smashed it into pieces.

Tuoba Dong’s Lion King Roar shattered space, yet it was forcefully ground to a halt almost one meter before Chi Huangji’s body. It couldn’t advance a single inch further.

The four king tiers had unleashed their trump cards together, yet their efforts were proven to be futile!

“Trash should just move aside!” Chi Huangji followed up with a punch that transformed into four flaming tigers that charged toward Faceless, Tuoba Dong, and the others.

Peng, peng, peng!

The four king tiers were all weakened after unleashing their trump cards, so how could they withstand Chi Huangji’s counterattack? They were instantly sent flying. Fortunately, they were king tiers just like Chi Huangji, so they only suffered a minor amount of damage.

The Cloud Maiden’s right sleeve was completely obliterated, revealing her smooth, jade-like arm. Meanwhile, Yang Lin slid back nine meters, his face as white as a sheet. He was barely able to stop himself from vomiting blood.

Tuoba Dong stumbled back 17 steps, leaving a deep footprint in the ground with each step that he took. His golden mane was disheveled as it billowed in the air.

Pa!

The cloth around Faceless’ face was torn into shreds, revealing... a featureless face.

Gasp!

Even though they were all young king tiers, they still couldn’t help but gasp upon seeing Faceless’ true appearance.

What kind of person was he? His face was like a blank canvas, and it was completely devoid of any features! In fact, he didn’t even have hair or ears! He simply had a featureless head. If it weren’t for the fact that his clothes had a clear front and back, it would have been genuinely impossible to determine which side was his face simply by looking at his head.

How did this person speak?

Faceless! He was genuinely faceless!

Faceless sighed softly. He clearly didn’t have a mouth, yet everyone could sense that he was indeed sighing. He unsheathed a sword from his guqin and shook it slightly, saying, “I never imagined that this moment would arrive so soon!”

“What’s this?” A hint of curiosity appeared on Chi Huangji’s face. Apart from cultivation, few things in the world could capture his interest. However, he had never seen or heard of such a tribe before, one where its members didn’t even have a face.

Shua!

Faceless swung his sword, not at Chi Huangji, but at his own “face”.

Pu!

Blood instantly sprayed into the air.

This... Was he self-harming and attempting suicide because others had seen his “ugliness”?

No!

Faceless swung his sword several times, carving several bloody holes into his “face”. It was as if he were drawing on a canvas, and a pair of eyes, a nose, and a mouth instantly appeared on his “face”.

Of course, these features were merely represented by bloody holes.

However, what happened next was absolutely astonishing. The bloody holes rapidly transformed, a pair of eyes appearing, a straight nose arching up, a mouth splitting open, and two rows of teeth appearing in the mouth.

Hair also started to grow from his head at an astonishing speed, as did his ears. After just a few seconds, a complete “person” had already appeared before them.

He was an incredibly handsome man. In fact, it could be said that he was a breathtakingly handsome man. He was so handsome that even other men would be jealous of his appearance.

However, the only emotion that the seven king tiers felt at this moment was shock. This was because Faceless’ aura was also rising explosively at this moment. It had already surpassed the level of ordinary king tiers, and it was currently surging toward the level of king among kings!
