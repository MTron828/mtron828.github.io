3004 Attaining Godhood in a single battle

Everyone was shocked. Hysteria’s army had actually charged over!

This was too sudden. Furthermore, their city walls had all been destroyed, and their defenses had been greatly reduced, while there was a new type of monster added to Hysteria’s army. It could self-explode and deliver peak-stage Seventh-Tier destructive power at any time. It would cause terrifying damage to both humans and the environment.

If one wanted to deal with this kind of monster, they would have to detect it from a very far distance away, and then use a long-distance attack to cause it to self-explode—this kind of monster had astonishing destructive power, but its own defenses were extremely weak. Even Second Tiers or Third Tiers could easily kill them.

Hence, if this kind of monster was discovered and destroyed in advance, it would explode within the ranks of Hysteria’s army, and instead cause great damage to Hysteria’s army. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The problem was that they were too difficult to detect; moreover, such monsters were actually hidden among the masses of Hysteria’s army, which were as vast as an ocean. It was almost impossible to destroy them in advance.

Now, their troops were at the foot of the city wall.

“Engage the enemy!” Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and the others all issued orders.

Meanwhile, Feng Wuding glared at Ling Han, and said sharply, “Just look at what you’ve done. Humph, even if you have the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier, you can’t do as you please like this!”

He was going to try his best to add charges to Ling Han’s name. Otherwise, the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier was practically invincible, so someone like that naturally had to be preserved at all costs in order to fight against Hysteria.

Thus, he definitely had to name Ling Han as someone who couldn’t be exempted even if he had performed a great merit.

For example, in the present situation, if innumerable Heavenly Venerates died because of Ling Han, then Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others wouldn’t be able to defend Ling Han even if they wanted to. Otherwise, just the death of Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable would not be enough.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “Of course, I have done a good deed. I have drawn all of Hysteria’s troops here, and they can be destroyed in one go.”

“You are indeed Hysteria’s subordinate!” Feng Wuding said through gritted teeth. This crime was a huge one indeed. Once it was confirmed that Ling Han was Hysteria’s subordinate, then all the Seventh Tiers would do their best to kill him.

“Trash! Barking all day long like a dog!” Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Fine, I’ll deal with those ugly guys outside first, then come and take your head.”

Xiu, he charged out.

At this moment, Ling Han didn’t need to worry about anything. Even if the Seventh Tiers joined forces to suppress him, he wouldn’t be afraid. However, he wasn’t someone who didn’t have a bottom line and couldn’t differentiate between right and wrong.

Of course, Feng Wuding had to be killed. However, Ling Han definitely couldn’t allow this to be the reason for the entire barrier to be buried alongside him.

There was no need to rush. In any case, Feng Wuding couldn’t run away.

Ling Han faced Hysteria’s troops, who were now charging over like a tsunami, directly.

Previously, he had killed at least 90% of Hysteria’s army by tossing out the dimension, but even if only 10% was left, this number was still astonishingly great, covering the sky and the earth, and forming a dark mass.

Ling Han was calm and unperturbed. He stretched out his right hand, and weng, power condensed, turning into a light orb that flickered with a strange brilliance, rippling like water.

“Go!” He tossed the ball of light casually.

It wasn’t until the light orb had reached the depths of Hysteria’s army that it came to a standstill.

“Explode,” Ling Han said softly. Boom, the light orb instantly detonated, and a terrifying wave of energy exploded, sweeping out in all directions.

Peng, peng, peng. Wherever the energy storm surged past, Hysteria’s troops were all turned into ashes. So what if they were Sixth Tiers? They were completely unable to withstand a single blow.

Ling Han’s hand moved continuously, throwing out one light orb after another. He was condensing the power of all his dimensions, which was equivalent to the bombardment of a small Genesis World, so the might was naturally terrifying.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Hysteria’s army instantly suffered a calamity, especially when one of the light balls killed an exploding monster, causing the latter to also explode with destructive power at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. Two energy storms at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier clashed with each other, either annihilating or strengthening, creating an even more terrifying destructive effect.

After Ling Han had unleashed several hundred light orbs, the entire Hysteria’s army were only left with merely less than 1,000.

They were once again killed off by Ling Han swiftly. With a snap of his fingers, every one of the monsters was being annihilated. In an instant, they all fell down from the skies.

Thus far, Hysteria’s army was completely wiped out, and none of them even rushed to the top of the city walls.

At this moment, complete silence fell upon the entire place, and everyone could only look at Ling Han with shock.

Out of all the heroes of the world, who else could it be but him?

He was just one person, and with a single move, millions and millions of Hysteria’s troops were turned into ashes. He was like a stabilizing force; even the mountains couldn’t be shaken.

As long as he was here, what need was there for the city walls?

One person was comparable to an army of thousands!

He was unlike the Seventh Tier ultimate elites. If they fought here, the Seventh Tier would be damaging Regulations. They themselves would cause damage to heaven and earth, which would be equivalent to helping Hysteria. Thus, in this level of the battlefield, people with the battle prowess of Seventh Tier like Lin Youlian, Feng Wuding, and the others were more practical than real Seventh Tiers—even if their strength was inferior.

And Ling Han was even more awesome, being able to deal with an entire army all by himself. There really was no one else like him.

Ling Han turned around and faced the people inside the city wall. His black robes fluttered, as if he was about to leave swiftly with the wind.

There was complete silence. No one could speak. They were completely captivated.

“Ling Han, even if you—”

Boom, Feng Wuding was just about to reprimand Ling Han when the entire area exploded with cheers like thunder. It was as if everyone had gone mad, looking at Ling Han with infatuation.

At this moment, they all thought of Ling Han as a god; a god that could save them all.

Standing proudly as one man, accepting the cheers of tens of thousands of Heavenly Venerates.

In comparison, whether it was Lin Youlian, Wu Haoyang, Xin Qihu, Feng Wuding, or Bai Mifan, they all paled in comparison.

This was like a stone being compared against a precious jade. One would be able to distinguish which was the bright and dazzling one with a single glance.

At the borders, Ling Han alone was enough!

When Feng Wuding saw this, he couldn’t help but feel endless jealousy.

He was the Son of Destiny, he was the one!

The one who was currently receiving the cheers and admiration of these 10,000,000 people should have been him, and not Ling Han.

However, not only were the people of the Genesis World filled with admiration towards Ling Han, but even the seeds from the previous generation were also the same. They didn’t even cast a second glance at him, the Alliance Leader of the Feng Alliance.

He gritted his teeth in hatred, flames of fury shooting from his eyes.

With such a great merit, and such an important capability, who would agree to execute Ling Han?

Could it be that this great mountain would be resting above his head for the rest of his life?

Could it be that he would have to live in Ling Han’s shadow for an eternity?

He wanted to kill! Kill! Kill!

Ling Han pressed his hands down, and everyone’s voices instantly disappeared. They all raised their heads to look at him, their eyes exuding admiration. It was as if with a single command from Ling Han, they would be willing to attack cities and strongholds for Ling Han’s sake. In fact, they would be unafraid even if they had to counterattack Hysteria’s main camp.

When Feng Wuding saw this, he almost died in fury. He had relied on his identity as the Son of Destiny and the might of five Seventh Tier ultimate elites, but it only made the seeds of the Genesis World of the last era unite around him and obey his commands.

However, look at Ling Han—he became the undisputed leader after just one battle.
