2831 The arrogant Rong Xinkuan

Among those Heavenly Venerates that originated from the Celestial Realm, it was Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate who had accomplished the least.

Wu Le had almost reached the Second Tier in the Celestial Realm, and he had shot sky-high after coming to the Flaming Frost Realm, having advanced to the Fourth Tier not too long ago. After all, while the Celestial Realm was indeed small, those able to attain First Tier in the Celestial Realm were actually all prodigies of the highest tier.

Green Flames was only slightly weaker, and had long since reached peak-stage Third Tier. It was possible that he would break through at any moment. Meanwhile, Sealed Emotion was even more domineering, having actually cultivated a Heavenly Venerable Seal that was his own. Though his present cultivation level was not as high as Wu Le’s, he might be able to surpass him in the future despite his slower start. It was even possible that his final accomplishment could be the Fifth Tier.

At present, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had just advanced to the Third Tier, but he had started from the Celestial King Tier. Being able to become a Heavenly Venerate in such a short period of time, the amount of strength he had was imaginable.

As for Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate?

He had long since advanced to the Third Tier, but after so many years, he was still stuck in the early stage of the Third Tier, and did not improve much at all.

In comparison, he paled despondently.

It was turbulent times now, and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate could not mind his own business and stay away from trouble, so he could only lower himself to join under the banner of Rong Tianyu. Originally, it would have been very, very hard for him to cross paths with Ling Han again, but who would have imagined that Rong Tianyu would actually ally with the Lin Clan. Hence, he also had the good luck to come along with the group of representatives this time.

Rong Xinkuan was Rong Yang’s cousin. He was far from being as freakish as Rong Yang, but with his powerful background, he had also cultivated to the height of Ninth Heaven. His personality was… quite self-centered.

After Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate arrived at Lin Clan, and found out that Ling Han was nearby, an idea came to him, and he began to egg Rong Xinkuan on.

What kind of person was Rong Xinkuan?

He was completely self-centered, and thinking that his uncle was a Sixth Tier elite, practically invincible in this world, he naturally considered everyone else below him.

…He did not dare to trifle with those like the Lin Clan and Chu Clan, but what was the Ling Clan worth? The strongest among them was only a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so how could he possibly care? He only had to send out Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and that would be enough to conquer all of them.

He wanted to snatch Ling Han’s Heavenly Venerable Seal, and hand it over to Rong Yang to gain the favor of this cousin of his. After all, he knew that he was far less important than Rong Yang in Rong Tianyu’s heart, so he naturally had to work hard to gain his cousin’s favor. Who knew, perhaps great luck might fall on him, and he would be able to step into Heavenly Venerable Tier, right?

Hence, with Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate egging him on, he came.

Rong Xinkuan crossed his arms behind him, and strode in front, while Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate followed closely behind. All this while, he stayed half a step behind him, which made Rong Xinkuan very pleased.

What he did not know was: with how overwhelmingly proud a Heavenly Venerate was, how could he possibly bow his head in front of a Ninth Heaven?

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was merely using him, and his purpose was naturally to have Rong Xinkuan to stand out—with Rong Xinkuan’s arrogance, added with Ling Han’s temper, the result would definitely be exceedingly terrible. Who knew, this idiot could be directly killed. At that time, Rong Yang would definitely interfere.

Was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate still not enough to suppress a mere Ling City?

Worse come to worst, even if Rong Yang was unable to deal with Ling City, something only had to happen to him, and a Sixth Tier would be angered… Ling Han would definitely be killed.

Ling Han’s location was naturally no secret, and was easily found out just by asking anyone. Hence, Rong Xinkuan and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate soon located him.

Rong Xinkuan revealed a smile of disdain. He strode forwards, heading for the main doors.

“Sir, who are you looking for?” There were naturally guards at the entrance into Ling Manor, and they immediately asked Rong Xinkuan. Because Ling Han very much disliked overbearing, condescending behavior, the servants of Ling Manor were very polite, and would not act arrogant just because there were three Heavenly Venerates in residence.

Yet Rong Xinkuan did not acknowledge them at all. Thinking that he was the nephew of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, he thought that everyone in the world should treat him respectfully. Hence, he merely glanced condescendingly at the guard, and then demanded, “Tell Ling Han to come out and receive me on bent knee!”

When the guard heard this, he was instantly outraged.

It was true that the servants of the Ling Clan did not have the bad habit of being overbearing and arrogant, but they also did not have the habit of letting someone else trample all over them.

Who did not know what kind of temper Ling Han had? As long as his own people had no fault, he would fully support them, and would show no fear no matter whom he was facing. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, Rong Xinkuan directly insulted Ling Han from the moment he opened his mouth this time, so how could this guard not feel furious?

He immediately drew out a spear, aimed straight for Rong Xinkuan, and said menacingly, “Immediately apologize, and withdraw your previous words!”

“A mere servant actually dares to make demands of me?” Rong Xinkuan scoffed. He stretched out his hand to suppress that guard.

The guard hurriedly countered, but he was only an Ascending Origin Tier, so how could he possibly match a Ninth Heaven?

Pa! Rong Xinkuan’s power took the form of a giant black hand that grabbed that guard.

“Beg for mercy, and I can spare your life!” Rong Xinkuan declared arrogantly.

“Ptui!” Yet that guard spat at Rong Xinkuan, but how could this possibly reach Rong Xinkuan. His spit was blocked by a protective light shield.

“You are courting death!” Rong Xinkuan raised a brow, killing intent spreading out in all directions. With a mere thought, that giant black hand immediately tightened its hold. Pa! That guard was instantly squeezed to burst, turning into a mush of blood.

“Trash that overestimated his own abilities!” he said condescendingly, and strode towards the main doors.

“Who goes there? To actually dare kill in the Ling Manor!” A man shot down in front of him.

Rong Xinkuan glanced at him, and then asked, “You are Ling Han?”

He had seen what Ling Han looked like before, and it was this appearance that was in front of him. However… the other’s cultivation level looked to only be the Ninth Heaven.

“I am Ling Huo!” this person said. His eyes swept over the surroundings, and immediately discovered the guard’s blood that had not completely fallen down. His expression became severe, and after some slight sensing, he immediately grabbed the remnants of that guard’s soul. Everything that had happened previously appeared in his mind’s eye.

He couldn’t help but be furious. This man had come to their Ling Clan, and just killed someone indiscriminately. Just how arrogant could he be?

…Ling Huo was the manifestation of one of the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth that Ling Han had previously obtained and later set free one after another, allowing them to gain self-consciousness.

A Source Power of heaven and earth had the advantage of a Source Power. By nature, they had the unique trait of the Celestial King Tier, but their limitations were also very apparent. Because they were nurtured from the heaven and earth, it was naturally impossible that they could surpass Regulations, so Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier was the highest peak they could reach. It was impossible that they could surpass this level and become Heavenly Venerates.

“How dare you!!” Ling Huo exclaimed menacingly. Previously, the nine of them had been roaming around in the world, and only until after they had attained Ninth Heaven and could not advance any further had they come to the Ling Clan, and established themselves as Ling Han’s followers.

Hence, he was naturally furious right now.

Rong Xinkuan revealed an expression of disdain. “Nothing but a mere servant, and he actually dared to spit at me. How could it be that he did not deserve to die? Your surname is Ling… What relation do you have with Ling Han? Never mind, I could care less. Go and call Ling Han to come out and greet me on bent knee!”

Aside from feeling furious, Ling Huo also felt an urge to break into laughter.

A mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King actually dared demand a First Tier Heavenly Venerate come out to receive him on bent knee?

“It would be better for you to obediently let me apprehend you, and wait quietly to be dealt with!” He launched his attack, intending to apprehend Rong Xinkuan.

He was not afraid of starting a battle here, because this was a place that had been refined by several Heavenly Venerates. Every single brick had a condensed sliver of power of a Heavenly Venerate, and was definitely not something that could crumble from a battle between Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.
