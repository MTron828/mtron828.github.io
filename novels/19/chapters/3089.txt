3090 New World

Lin Luo and the others nodded.

“I’ll go first.” Lin Luo stepped out, wanting to be the vanguard.

This was actually very risky. Who knew what dangers lay outside? Perhaps there were as many Eighth Tiers as there were dogs? They could kill any Seventh Tier with a casual punch. If he walked out so rashly, what if he was slapped to death?

Without waiting for Ling Han to stop him, Lin Luo took the lead.

Ling Han knew that Lin Luo was intentionally testing the waters for him. If there was really any danger, then Ling Han could also make some preparations.

However, although Lin Luo was the first to leave, it was difficult for him to take even a single step after entering that door. He had only taken five steps when he stopped. Then, that door of light, seemingly possessing incomparable elasticity, bounced Lin Luo back with a bang.

‘This!’

“To pass through this door, you need endless power,” Lin Luo said with a bitter smile. He had originally wanted to test the waters for Ling Han, but he hadn’t expected that he wouldn’t be able to do even this.

Bai Fan, Xin Fu, and the others tried one by one, but they couldn’t pass through.

Opening the door required the energy of the entire Void, so it would probably be the same if one wanted to transmigrate through it.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Everyone, you’d better enter the dimensions inside my body first. Otherwise, I’m worried that once we get out, this door will close, and I won’t be able to open it again.”

“Yes!” Everyone nodded.

Ling Han moved, and drew everyone into his body. In any case, he had already created transcendent dimensions that numbered in the millions, which was far more powerful than the Genesis World of the past, and was enough to bear the power of these Seventh Tiers.

Now, he was the only one left in the vast Void.

He looked at the door of light, then looked behind him, and a resolute expression appeared on his face. He suddenly turned around and strode forward.

Weng, Ling Han entered the door of light, and an endless wave of resistance instantly assaulted him, wanting to push him back.

No wonder Lin Luo and the others were unable to pass through this door. Such resistance was truly formidable.

However, to Ling Han, who possessed the power of the entire Void, this was still not an obstacle.

Ling Han took large strides forward, and under the vigorous oscillation of his power, the power that could stop a Seventh Tier in his tracks seemed insignificant.

He went deeper. Behind the door of light was a passageway that seemed to have a life of its own, squirming as it was.

Boom! Behind him, the Void was collapsing. The space he had been living in was about to disappear.

Now, there was no turning back. He could only move forward.

Ling Han walked faster and faster. His will was resolute, and since he had already made up his mind, he would not hesitate at all.

Forward, forward, forward.

He wanted to know if there was really a great world beyond this “small puddle.”

The Void behind him collapsed in large swathes, even affecting this passageway. The door of light shattered with a loud bang. Peng, peng, peng! The entire passageway began to collapse as well, and the destruction was rapidly spreading toward him.

This speed was even faster than Ling Han could walk forwards.

F*ck.

Ling Han did not know how powerful the destructive power of this collapse was. Perhaps it could even injure his physical body?

Therefore, it was best that he did not let it catch up to him.

He sped up, becoming as fast as lightning.

However, after running for almost an hour, Ling Han suddenly discovered that there was no path ahead.

It was a dead end?

Ling Han roared furiously, and raised his fist. All of his power condensed, and blasted forward.

BANG!

How powerful was he? With a furious blast, the area in front of him instantly shattered… No matter what it was.

A burst of light struck him, catching him off guard, and causing him to immediately close his eyes. Peng, he fell to the ground.

“Haha, the divine stone has come into being! The divine stone has come into being!” A voice rang out beside Ling Han, carrying an incomparably pleasant surprise.

Ling Han was stunned at first, and then a strange feeling rose in his heart. He clearly didn’t understand the other party’s language, so why did he understand what this person meant?

He wanted to get up, but he realized that he was extremely weak. He didn’t even have the strength to get up.

This surprised Ling Han, and he even felt a trace of fear.

He had fused with the power of the entire Void. How powerful was he? But now he couldn’t even stand up?

Ling Han tried his best to open his eyes, and turned to look. He saw an old man walking towards him. He was short and had messy hair, and his face was filled with excitement and a crazy smile.

At this moment, Ling Han felt incomparably weak, as if he were an ordinary person, or even more inferior to an ordinary person.

His first reaction was to release Lin Luo and the others from his body. He didn’t know why he was exhausted, but Lin Luo and the others were at the Seventh Tier, which was enough to ensure his safety.

However, he immediately realized that he couldn’t release them at all.

‘What happened? What happened?’

The old man had already come over and flipped Ling Han over, his eyes sizing him up. “The divine stone shattered on its own, and the divine son appeared, descending upon my Ancient Dao Sect. This is a Dao Child bestowed by the heavens, indicating that my sect will rise in the upcoming great era!”

What was this old man talking about? What divine stone and divine son? Was he talking about him?

“Don’t move! Don’t move!” The old man pressed down on Ling Han. His power was so great that Ling Han couldn’t move at all. “You’ve just been born, and you’ve exhausted all your power. You’re currently extremely weak.

“Uh, do you understand what I’m saying?”

The old geezer looked at Ling Han with great anticipation.

Ling Han finally turned over and looked behind him. There were many stone fragments there, and one of them was extremely huge. Based on his inference, this had originally been a massive rock that was close to a spherical shape. Now, the stone had shattered, but the stone fragments below it were still there.

Combined with the old man’s words, Ling Han had a guess in his heart.

Did he break out of this stone just now?

Was this even possible?

The Genesis World and the endless Void were actually inside this stone?

Ling Han was so shocked that he was speechless. No wonder Extermination and Hysteria had always said that they lived in a small puddle. In terms of size, this was actually not even comparable to a small puddle.

He nodded at the old man. “I can understand.”

“You can understand me, but I can’t understand your words,” the old geezer said. “I’m really curious. 30 years ago, Lord Sect Master brought the divine stone back, and said that according to ancient records, it would give birth to a supreme spirit embryo!

“It’s been more than 30 years. I’ve finally completed my wait!”

The old geezer was very excited, as if he had found a huge treasure.

Ling Han’s mind was filled with thoughts of disbelief. He had worked hard all the way in the Genesis World and fought until he was the strongest, but he had actually only managed to snatch the right to be “born”?

Where was his supreme power?

Ling Han was dejected, and his mind was blank. This was like a person who had become a billionaire through hard work, but suddenly, for no reason at all, he had turned into a poor beggar. How could such a disparity in status be easily accepted?

He didn’t even realize how he was carried away, and then placed inside a room. After that, he was in a daze. It seemed that many people were coming in and out, saying something, but it was too far away for him to hear a word.

However, only two days later, Ling Han pulled himself together. As long as his people were still around, he could start all over again. Moreover, there were countless people living in the dimensions in his body, and there was too much responsibility on his shoulders.

He had to pull himself together.
