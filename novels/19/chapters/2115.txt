Chapter 2116: Black Tortoise Chaos Origin Soil

With a new Source Power of Space entering his body, it was inevitable that there would be struggle and conflict between the Source Powers. Fortunately, Ling Han was already accustomed to this kind of conflict. He would allow the five Source Powers to fight to their heart’s content before he mediated for them, and acted as peacemaker.

Even though the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water had both been extracted from his body, their source was still engraved within him, and they didn’t show any signs of wanting to move.

After dealing with the Spiritual Void Glass, it was time for him to obtain the Purple Spirit Flames.

This was slightly more difficult. This was because Ling Han couldn’t absorb this Source Power. However, he still had to convince this Source Power of heaven and earth to leave with him. This was an extremely difficult task.

Anyhow, he would give it a try. Since it was a Source Power of heaven and earth, it most likely had some form of sentience.

Ling Han adjusted his direction, and arrived at the head of the cultivator.

This was a sea of flames. Amid this sea of flames, there was a small dog happily jumping about.

The Purple Spirit Flames had actually taken the form of a dog!

Had it developed intelligence and become a unique life form?

“It’s only taken the preliminary step of becoming a unique and independent individual. However, it’s still a long way off becoming a genuine life form,” Small Tower said.

“In other words, this small dog only has the intelligence of a two- to three-year-old child?” Ling Han murmured. “I can trick it then.”

He stopped near the sea of flames, saying, “Adorable puppy, come over here. Let me have a closer look.”

Because he was only a divine sense at this moment, his speech was naturally transmitted through his divine sense as well. There was no problem communicating with the dog. Thus, the small dog immediately looked over, cocking its head in hesitation.

“It’s going to be very fun~” Ling Han continued with his shady behavior.

The small dog took a few steps over before stopping again. It wore an expression of hesitation as it gazed at Ling Han.

“Come on, come over here!”

If Ling Han’s physical body were here, he would definitely retrieve all kinds of food from the Black Tower to entice the small dog. Now, however, he could only use words to trick it.

The small dog stopped and started, and only after a long time did it finally reach the edge of the sea of flames. After arriving here, however, it was extremely reluctant to take another step.

“Come on, come over here. I also own a large black dog, and you guys might even be acquainted with each other,” Ling Han continued.

The small dog merely cocked its head as it looked at him. It didn’t bark, and it didn’t take another step forward, either.

“Don’t be afraid, come on over,” Ling Han said as he started to step back.

When he retreated a fair distance, the small dog started to become restless. It continued to pace back and forth, occasionally stopping to glance at Ling Han. It was seemingly indecisive about whether it should head over or not.

“If you don’t come now, there won’t be another chance,” Ling Han said as he continued to retreat.

The small dog finally made up its mind, suddenly spreading its legs and sprinting toward Ling Han.

Peng!

It rammed into Ling Han, causing his mind to shudder. Meanwhile, his divine sense had already been pushed out from the cultivator’s body. A ball of flames followed after it, and it crashed toward Ling Han’s body.

However, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t absorb this Source Power of heaven and earth. “Small Tower!” he immediately shouted in his mind.

“Are you sure?” Small Tower asked. It knew what Ling Han was thinking.

“I’m certain!” Ling Han answered without hesitation.

Weng!

A black tower instantly materialized, radiating with a paramount aura. It was as if this tower was heaven and earth. This was a unique existence among heaven and earth.

It was the Tower of Three Realms!

The ball of flames instantly ground to a halt. Even though this was only a ball of flames, Ling Han could still feel some kind of willpower emanating from it. It was showing respect and apprehension toward the Black Tower.

The Black Tower expanded slightly as it engulfed the ball of flames. With a whoosh, it then vanished as it returned to Ling Han’s body.

This was an extremely risky action. The Tower of Three Realms was far too powerful, and it had even transcended the level of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Thus, its appearance in the world would definitely trigger shock waves among heaven and earth. Heavenly Venerates could easily sense these disturbances.

Ling Han only dared to do this because this was in the void. There existed boundless chaotic winds, and they could greatly muffle the shock waves caused by the Tower of Three Realms. There was a 90 percent chance that he could avoid the detection of Heavenly Venerates.

If this were an ordinary environment, unless Small Tower could suppress the aura of the Black Tower, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t dare to act so rashly. However, since he had a 90 percent chance of avoiding detection, he was willing to take a gamble.

Everything… remained calm.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. If a Heavenly Venerate truly descended, the situation would be futile even if the Black Tower unleashed its full might.

“You’re wrong,” Small Tower said with pride. “If I face them head-on, I’ll naturally be no match for them. However, helping you flee will be no problem at all. It’s just that you’ll become a target of those old folks, and you won’t need to think about leaving the Black Tower anymore. Otherwise, your only fate would be death.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. If he didn’t need to use the Black Tower, it was best that he didn’t use it.

“Let’s go, it’s time to look for the next Source Power of heaven and earth.”

Small Tower continued to guide him. After a day, they discovered a large boulder.

“Is there a Celestial King buried underneath?” Ling Han asked.

“Wrong! This is the Celestial King!” Small Tower replied with a sneer.

‘Huh? It’s a rock?’

“This is the Azure Rock Celestial King, who was an ordinary rock before attaining dao. Because he was sat on top of by… during his seclusion[1], he gained awareness and developed intelligence. In the end, he even became a Celestial King,” Small Tower said. “Because he attained dao as a rock, it was also very easy for him to receive acknowledgment from the Source Power of Earth. As such, he obtained the Black Tortoise Chaos Origin Soil.”

Ling Han raised his hands and asked, “Hang on, you said the Azure Rock Celestial King was sat on top of by whom during their cultivation?”

“Fool, we can’t speak his name. This person is far too powerful, so speaking his name will instantly grab his attention. Do you want to die?” Small Tower spoke to Ling Han as if he were a retard.

“Is he one of the three Heavenly Venerates?” Ling Han asked.

“Mm-hm.” Small Tower didn’t ridicule him this time.

Ling Han was truly curious. Just who were these three Heavenly Venerates? However, if he asked, Small Tower would definitely say that he couldn’t speak their names or titles. Otherwise, this would grab their attention. With a single thought, these Heavenly Venerates might even materialize before them.

At that time, Ling Han would have no option but to retreat inside the Black Tower and spend the remainder of his life fleeing.

Ling Han pushed aside his curiosity. There were more important matters to deal with at this moment.

Within this rock… was a Source Power of heaven and earth!

This was something he dearly needed right now.

He sat down and started to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, attracting the Source Power of Earth inside the rock.

The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was far too powerful, being a cultivation technique created by a Heavenly Venerate, so it possessed a strong ability to attract Source Powers of heaven and earth. Thus, it wasn’t long before the rock started to glow.

Thump, thump, thump… ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was as if the rock possessed life, and it was as if it possessed a heart that was beating.

‘Hurry, come over here!’

Ling Han didn’t have much time. The battle between the Black Dragon King, the Eternal Celestial King, and Xiao Gu might end at any moment, and it was possible that the Black Dragon King might appear before him at any time. If that happened, he would either have to retreat inside the Black Tower or be killed. In any case, he would lose the chance to obtain this Source Power of heaven and earth.

Three days passed, and the entire rock was now glowing. It then became transparent, revealing a five-colored block of soil in its center. This block of soil continued to transform into all kinds of shapes and figures.

Pa!

The rock suddenly split apart, and the five-colored block of soil vigorously dashed into the air before flying toward Ling Han.

Pu!

The block of five-colored soil slammed into Ling Han’s head before fusing into his body.

Boom!

Violent waves instantly surged through Ling Han’s Dantian. The Source Powers were fighting against each other again, trying to conquer more land for themselves.

Fine… He would continue to act as a peacemaker…
