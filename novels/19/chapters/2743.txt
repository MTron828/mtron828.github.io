2744 Dare to Battle?

An Tayun’s face twitched upon hearing this.

Ling Han’s words were far too arrogant! Boundlessly arrogant!

An Tayun was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate! Meanwhile, Ling Han was at most a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate from the Promise City Realm, equal in standing to him. Thus, what right did he have to utter such words?

It was no wonder that he had a grandson like Ling Feifan. They were definitely related by blood.

!!

“Don’t you think you’re a bit too arrogant?” An Tayun said through gritted teeth.

Ling Han wore a wide smile, replying, “If I possess such strength, then admitting to it isn’t being arrogant. It’s merely speaking the truth.”

“Very well. Then show me what you’ve got!”

An Tayun launched a casual palm strike at Ling Han.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before summoning 50% of his strength, and replying with a punch of his own.

Peng!

Both of them shook due to the violent contact. A fracture then spread from under their feet, instantly covering the entire courtyard.

Boom!

The courtyard that had existed for heaven knew how many years instantly crumbled and collapsed.

Crack!

Heaven and earth instantly responded, with countless arcs of lightning striking down at An Tayun. However, none of them targeted Ling Han.

This was because he was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Thus, his strength was absolutely within the limits of what the Martial Crystalline Realm could withstand.

An Tayun was naturally unafraid of the lightning. However, he was astonished at the fact that Ling Han hadn’t been targeted even though his strength was no weaker than his. Why wasn’t he being targeted by heaven and earth even though he was definitely a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?

This went against all logic.

Thus, An Tayun didn’t attack again. Instead, he mulled over this problem in his mind.

“I’m so sorry, I’m truly sorry, Nephew. I accidentally destroyed your house!” Ling Han hurriedly said in a sincere voice.

However, his words seemingly woke An Tayun from his deep thought. His black hair instantly billowed in the wind, reflecting his rage.

This was his home, a home that he had lived in for countless years. It was the symbol of the An Clan, and at the same time, it was also a symbol of this dimension. Yet, it had been destroyed at his and Ling Han’s hands.

He naturally wouldn’t blame himself; he would only blame Ling Han.

Ling Feifan bared his teeth. His grandfather was just as his elders had described. He was born with a trouble-attracting halo. Would you look? Wasn’t he adding fuel to the fire by saying that? And he had even referred to An Tayun as his nephew! How could An Tayun not go wild with rage?

However, his eyes also lit up at the same time. Only a single epoch had passed, yet Ling Han had already become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate! How freakish!

One had to realize that to most prodigies, one epoch was barely enough time for them to advance a single minor level in the Celestial King Tier. This was to say nothing of reaching the Second Tier of the Heavenly Venerable Tier and becoming the most powerful in the dimension.

“Brother An, why so angry?” a calm voice said from the distance. It was as if this voice had traveled over from tens of thousands of kilometers away, yet it was as if it were also right by their ears. It was impossible to decipher where it had come from.

An Tayun faltered for a brief moment before saying, “Brother Yang?”

Whoosh!

A figure appeared before them. This was a handsome young man, though the hair at his temples had already become white. His eyes were also filled with a sense of vicissitudes, and his aura couldn’t be detected.

With a wave of his hand, another person materialized before them. This was also an extremely handsome youth, with nine ribbons of iridescent light around him, signifying his status as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Upon appearing, the youth immediately paid his respects to An Tayun, saying, “Yang Xuanlong pays his respects to Lord An!”

An Tayun smiled in reply, his eyes filled with kindness and affection as he looked at the youth. This was because Yang Xuanlong was the ideal son-in-law in his mind.

Yang Xuanlong was the seventh and youngest son of Yang Zhixhe, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. However, even though people praised all seven sons as dragons, they all said that the seventh son was the most powerful. Even though he wasn’t the first to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he was definitely the most powerful among them.

He was a prodigy who had the potential to become a Heavenly Venerate.

“No need to pay respects,” An Tayun said as he made a lifting motion with his hand. He then turned to the man with white hair at the temples, and said, “Brother Yang, what brings you here?”

This person was none other than Yang Zhihe.

Yang Zhihe first glanced at Ling Han and Ling Feifan before saying, “The fall of the Promise City Realm is imminent, so I want to form an alliance with Brother An, advancing and retreating in unison.”

An Tayun instantly became stern upon hearing this. Once a dimension was destroyed and engulfed, this would represent a huge opportunity to Heavenly Venerates such as them. This was because the core of the dimension would be exposed. Even if they couldn’t obtain it, the large amounts of energy that it exuded could still allow them to comprehend a third fundamental power.

This was a critical factor that would decide whether they could advance to the Third Tier or not.

However, there were seven Second Tier Heavenly Venerates in the Martial Crystalline Realm, meaning that there were more predators than prey. Thus, conflict was inevitable. As such, forming an alliance with other Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would naturally increase his chances of victory.

An Tayun nodded, and said, “That’s a good suggestion.”

This reply was naturally well within Yang Zhihe’s expectations. He smiled, and continued, “My youngest son has been busy with cultivation all his life, so he’s still yet to be married. I especially brought him over today to make an offer of marriage. I wish that Brother An can wed his precious daughter to my son.”

Yang Xuanlong stepped forward again, bowing to An Tayun and saying, “Lord An, I’ve adored Xiu’er for a long time already, so please accept my proposal!”

An alliance agreed upon verbally was naturally unreliable, so having the two clans tied together through marriage was naturally far more secure.

One was the most outstanding son of the Yang Clan, and one was the young princess of the An Clan. Such a marriage would naturally solidify their alliance, making it turn into an indestructible one.

An Tayun was instantly enticed by this offer. He had already been satisfied with Yang Xuanlong to begin with, so adding to that an alliance, he felt an urge to accept this offer with no further thought.

Ling Feifan was extremely anxious, and he hurriedly turned to Ling Han, shouting, “Grandpa!”

If his grandfather didn’t say anything, his granddaughter-in-law would disappear just like that!

Ling Han sighed upon hearing this. Why was he forced into a fight just to get a granddaughter-in-law? Was he truly a magnet for trouble?

“Um, Nephew…” he said.

Pu!

Ling Feifan felt a strong urge to vomit blood. Meanwhile, Yang Xuanlong and Yang Zhihe both glanced over with confused expressions. Who was this disheveled beggar? He was actually referring to An Tayun as nephew?

How did he dare? That was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

An Tayun’s expression was dark, and it was as if flames were about to burst from his eyes. He could barely contain his murderous urge.

Ling Han waved his hands with a smile, saying, “Alright, alright, let’s not talk about this first. Ahem, I’ve also brought my grandson here today to make an offer of marriage. I hope the An Clan can agree to this proposal.”

“Alright!” An Tayun said coldly. Yang Xuanlong’s expression instantly changed upon hearing this. However, Yang Zhihe wasn’t worried at all; he understood An Tayun very well. Sure enough, An Tayun continued, “Which maidservant have you set your eyes on? She’s all yours!”

Ling Han had continued to refer to him as “nephew” time and time again just then, so now it was his turn to return the favor.

Ling Han faltered for a moment before roaring with laughter, and saying, “Who would’ve thought! You’re also a fairly humorous person, huh? I’m especially eager to meet my granddaughter-in-law now. She’s likely also a very interesting person.

“See, what’s so bad about my grandson? Even though his cultivation is slightly weaker, defeating that small fry at the same cultivation will be as easy as a wave of his hands!” Ling Han said as he wrapped an arm around Ling Feifan’s shoulder. He then pointed his finger at Yang Xuanlong.

Yang Xuanlong was infuriated. So be it if he wanted to praise his own grandson. But was it really necessary to use him as a stepping stone?

He humphed, and said, “I can suppress such trash with a simple turn of my palm.”

Ling Feifan naturally wouldn’t back down. He pointed at Yang Xuanlong, and said, “If we battle at the same cultivation level, you’re nothing but an insect! I can crush you to death with a single stomp!”

Ling Han was all smiles upon hearing this. Ling Jianxue was far too modest and calm, and that made him no fun at all. He was nowhere near as interesting as this grandson.

“Do you dare to battle?” Ling Han asked, further fanning the flames.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
