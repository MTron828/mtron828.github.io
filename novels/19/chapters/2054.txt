Chapter 2055: Strange Dragon Crystal

When the golden condor saw that its attack had had no effect, it involuntarily released another cry. However, this time it did not release any sound wave blade. It was just a furious cry, as if it was wondering why it had not managed to kill Ling Han and his party with this attack.

It was extremely fast. With a quick flap of wings, it had already disappeared in the distance, but it was soon followed by a quick turn. It had immediately flown back, gliding in the skies, but considerably slower now.

The golden condor glared at Ling Han and his group, its eyes glittering with coldness. Suddenly, it released another sharp cry that turned into four sound wave blades that struck out towards Ling Han, the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou, respectively.

It was still not giving up?

Ling Han moved, and it was still Great Clash of Source Powers. A frightening storm of energy exploded, and the four sound wave blades were once again destroyed.

This golden condor was a Heaven Soul, yet the force of its attack had far surpassed that level. It was very possible that it was an emperor tier, or even monarch tier. Thus, to say nothing of how the Empress and Hu Niu would not be a match for it, even Ling Han could not possibly match it if he did not use the Great Clash of Source Powers.

“Get down here!” Ling Han shouted at the skies. The Regulations of Gravity here were too chaotic, so he could not fly.

The golden condor paid no attention to it, and merely circled around in the skies, occasionally releasing another sound wave blade.

After repeating this for quite a few times, the golden condor finally understood that this could not possibly kill Ling Han. Then, with a flap of its wings, it streaked through the skies. This time, it did not fly back after flying off.

Ling Han and the others were very displeased. Though they had not sustained any damage, they were naturally irritated after having a feathery animal attack them repeatedly for so many times when they could not counter for the whole while.

Unfortunately, aside from winged creatures, there was no one that could fly here. They could do nothing but stare helplessly.

“Humph, make sure Niu doesn’t find its lair, or Niu will tear it apart!” Hu Niu fumed.

The four of them continued on their way. They did not enter the forest. Who knew what was living inside it.

In a Mystery Realm, one had to be careful at all times because there were some dangers that came from a great many negligible creatures. For example, bugs. They clearly did not have any cultivation level, but were capable of easily piercing through the defenses of elites, and injecting fatal poison.

And there were also unremarkable weeds that had sawtooth-shaped leaves that could render even the defenses of Immortal Palace Tier elites ineffective. These leaves also had powerful poison, and could kill one easily and imperceptibly.

For another example, there were sharp rock spikes on the ground, completely indestructible and with a murderous aura that could destroy vital signs.

Thus, if one could avoid going into such unknown surroundings, it was best not to.

“Roar!”

A beast roar rang out, and a massive black bear walked out from the rocks. It was as tall as 30 meters, flames burning in its eyes, seeming very formidable.

“Niu goes!” Hu Niu was excited at the sight of it, and was the first to rush out. “We’re having bear paws for lunch!”

Peng!

She had just pounced out when a human figure streaked past, crashed into the rock behind them, and slid down with a creak.

This great black bear stood on its hind legs, and was still maintaining the position of delivering a paw strike—the one being struck flying back naturally could only be Hu Niu.

“Ow, ow, ow!” Hu Niu gritted her teeth, and struggled out of the rock. She had been forcefully embedded into the rock, the impact so harsh that it seemed like all the bones in her body had been crushed. “What a strong bear paw, but it should be very delicious!”

She leaped up, and charged off to attack the black bear again.

The great black bear used the same move, and still delivered a paw strike. However, while Hu Niu might look unreliable, her battle perception was extremely high, so how could she possibly fall for the same thing twice?

With a turn of her figure,?xiu, xiu, xiu, she began circling around the great black bear, making maximum use of her agility.

…What was a Roc?

As a bird, it could cross 90,000 miles with a single flap of its wings, and its cry rang out through the skies. It was one of the representatives of extreme speed in this world.

At this instant, Hu Niu’s images were scattered throughout the area, at least 100 of them. This was because her speed was too high, leaving behind afterimages that looked almost real.

“Come on, big guy. Niu is definitely going to munch on your bear paw!” The bear paw was constantly in her thoughts. This was the obsession of a glutton.

The great black bear snarled. Its cultivation level had already reached the Heaven Soul, and it itself was a king tier. In terms of strength, it was far superior to Hu Niu. But the problem here was it could not hit its target at all, so what was the use of its strong battle prowess?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Hu Niu, on the other hand, kept delivering palm strikes and punches consistently against the black bear. Though she looked pure and cute, she was absolutely harsh and heavy in her attacks. This great black bear was endlessly crying out because of her assault, the flames in its eyes turning into a ball-like form.

These two fireballs had been blazing red at first, but they were actually slowly turning darker, and occasionally, a white-colored pattern would appear on them, which appeared very bizarre.

A sense of foreboding rose up in Ling Han’s heart, and he exclaimed, “Niu, be careful— never mind, I’ll do it!”

“No, Niu still wants to play!” Hu Niu giggled, and continued to attack the great black bear.

Boom! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Just at this moment, those two dark-colored balls of light suddenly exploded, turning into a terrifying shock wave.?Boom, the surroundings in diameter of 10 miles were all turned into an ocean of flames. There was frightening Regulations of Fire wreaking havoc there, wanting to burn everything down.

Ling Han withdrew his hand. Just now, he had managed to move in time, standing guard in front of the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou, but as for Hu Niu…

“Niu is fine!” Hu Niu giggled. There was a light shield around her. It was a Roc that was about to surface from the water, flap its wings, and fly. With a soft exclamation from her, this Roc flew out, moving to suppress the great black bear.

Peng!

With a crash, the black bear immediately stumbled, and almost tripped.

This was the little girl having awakened the bloodline of the Roc, but even such a powerful move only made the great black bear stumble, but did not injure it, which showed that the great black bear’s strength was really powerful.

“Attack together!”

Ling Han, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou all charged over, ganging up on this great black bear with their combined efforts.

If Ling Han did not use the Great Clash of Source Powers, even he could not be a match for this great black bear. Even if the four of them worked together, that would only be barely enough. They would only be capable of managing a tie.

However, Ling Han’s physique was tough enough, and could completely bear the attack of the great black bear. With him focusing on the assault, tightly attracting all the attack power of the great black bear, the three women were allowed to completely unleash the full force of their assault.

After wearing it out for two days, they finally managed to kill this great black bear. They all slumped onto the ground, feeling extremely tired.

After panting a few times, they all laughed loudly, feeling a happiness they could not describe.

Using their own actual strength to kill a fierce beast stronger than themselves gave a very strong feeling of accomplishment.

“Bear paw! Bear paw!” Only Hu Niu was extraordinarily energetic. She surveyed the great black bear very happily, her drool dripping.

Ling Han rested for a while, and then dismembered the great black bear. The four bear paws were barbecued on the bonfire, and it was just enough for each of them to have one. The meat of a Heaven Soul Immortal Beast was very delicious in the first place, what more when it was something as fine as bear paw.

“Here’s another Dragon Crystal.” He drew out a red Dragon Crystal from within the brain of the great black bear.

“Yi, there seems to be some kind of design on it.” Bewitching Maiden Rou’s eyes were quite sharp.

The Empress took it over for a look, and soon nodded. “There is a design, and it has a strong regularity in its pattern, but I can’t tell what exactly it is.”

Ling Han also took it over for observation. This Dragon Crystal was indeed different from the one that they had gotten previously. There was a very complex veined pattern on the surface, but it was definitely not seals of great dao—Ling Han was completely able to confirm that fact.
