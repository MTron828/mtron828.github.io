Chapter 1603: The Hu Clan is alerted

The Empress raised her hand, looking like she was planning to strike him again.

Cai Miao quickly broke into a run and fled, but he had just moved when he realized that he had actually entered into a completely closed off space. There was no way out of this space. In the moment that he was stunned, he had once again returned to a normal dimension, yet another person had appeared in front of him.

It was Ling Han.

Suddenly, he felt an intense fury and hatred sprout in him. The Empress had already become a big shot among big shots, and he was completely no match for her, but Ling Han was only in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, so how could he possibly be a match for a big shot like himself?

“I’ll just take it out on you!” He grabbed at Ling Han. He planned to take out the frustration he experienced with the Empress on Ling Han.

Ling Han felt a moment of distress. There were really so many abilities that he possessed now that he did not know which one he should use to deal with Cai Miao.

Killing formation? Nine Heavens Flame? Lightning Sword Technique? Tide of the Ages? Darkness of the Paramount Night? Flying Dragon Shadow Hands?

He sighed softly.

In Cai Miao’s eyes, this was naturally an expression of weakness. He couldn’t help but smirk coldly. This brat was really ridiculous. He no longer had a Saint King’s power, and still dared oppose him? Humph, what a ******!

He hated Ling Han for having such a precious treasure like the Saint King blood essence and actually using it for momentary satisfaction. If it was given to him, he naturally would use it in an ancient site when he was searching for treasure—just how valuable would that kind of treasure be that would need the Saint King blood essence to be able to get hold of it?

What a waste! A great waste!

Thus, he hated Ling Han very much. He pressed out a palm, and the killing formation activated. He would not kill Ling Han, but would render him as much suffering as he possibly could.

Ling Han considered for a moment, and then pointed a finger at Cai Miao. An indescribable, most quiet darkness immediately wrapped around Cai Miao. It was clearly only a nine meters wide area, but Cai Miao was still trapped within, and could not escape no matter what he did.

Everyone was stunned. Had Ling Han become a Saint? How could he trap Cai Miao in darkness just by pointing a single finger, and he did not reappear after that! Furthermore, he had caused Cai Miao to disappear mysteriously just now, so what technique was that?

Only a few years had passed, and the gap between them and Ling Han seemed to have widened to an indescribable extent.

A few years ago, they could still say that Ling Han had channeled the Saint King blood essence, so it was absolutely normal that they were no match for him, but now?

Some people were incredibly awesome, and were always able to create miracles, while others could only worship them.

“Senior Brother Ling!” Everyone cheered. Cultivators admired the elite, and Ling Han had used true strength to win everyone’s respect.

Ling Han nodded with a smile, and entered the academy with the two women. All the disciples followed behind him, and talked excitedly. The majority of them were asking Ling Han about his experiences in these several years, and of course, there were some that wanted to know how Ling Han had become so strong.

Ling Han did not conceal anything. He spoke of how he had been hunted by Hu Feng, and escaped into the Netherworld. Yet he thrived there, and even had some relations with two Demon Masters, which made everyone cluck their tongues in surprise. If it had been them, they could not have possibly lasted until the change in Regulations was complete. They would long since have been targeted and killed by the elites of the Netherworld.

Of course, Ling Han naturally could not possibly reveal core secrets such as the Celestial Realm and the Black Tower. There were some things that still required the Star Sand Saint to decide whether to announce them or not.

“You’ve returned.” The Tranquil Heart Saint appeared, and nodded at Ling Han, an expression of surprise flickering on his face.

27 killing formations, and furthermore, it was the strongest killing formation beneath Saint-level, the Limitless Nine Deaths Formation!

This brat was a monster!

“Greetings, Saint!” Ling Han greeted with clasped hands. The Tranquil Heart Saint could be termed a good teacher and helpful friend to him.

“Come!” The Tranquil Heart Saint brought Ling Han to meet with the Star Sand Saint.

The threat from the Hu Clan had not been resolved. How could Ling Han dare to return at this time? Did he want to die?

Ling Han only said that he had a way to temporarily possess the abilities of a Saint King, and there was no need to worry about the Hu Clan. Additionally, he revealed the secret of the Celestial Realm to the two Saints. In the future, when he entered into the Celestial Realm, he would not mind bringing some people along with him.

The two Saints were stunned. Even though they were already standing at the peak of the Immortal Realm, as it turned out, if they were in the Immortal Realm, they couldn’t even be termed elites.

This caused them some disappointment, and it was even difficult for them to accept, but Saints were Saints, after all. It was naturally impossible that they would not even have that bit of courage, and they soon pulled themselves together—they could cultivate to the highest level in the Ancient Realm, which proved that their natural talent was astonishing, so after they entered into the Celestial Realm, they should not be inferior to anyone, either.

After returning to the eighth campus, Ling Han focused on asking guidance from the Tranquil Heart Saint about formations. This was a Saint that had succeeded Dao through formations, and in terms of understanding of formations, he was far superior to the Star Sand Saint.

The Tranquil Heart Saint admired Ling Han very much, and he felt internally rueful. Previously, it would have been good if he had been able to take Ling Han as his personal disciple, but now, the potential and abilities that the latter showed caused even him to gasp in surprise, and he himself felt that he did not have the qualification to take Ling Han as a disciple.

Ling Han had long since been able to kill Hu Yingmu, yet he himself did not even manage to take one attack from the latter!

Furthermore, Ling Han had asked many questions that gave him extremely great inspiration, and repeatedly made many clever remarks and voiced unusual ideas. Going by that trend, it might not take a few thousand years, and he would be able to advance to become a Medium Saint.

He couldn’t help but feel more doting towards Ling Han, and increasingly felt that it was a pity that he was not his disciple.

Ling Han’s gains were even greater. In terms of grasping the basics of formations, the Tranquil Heart Saint far surpassed him, and when he explained the difficult subject matter in simple and easily understandable terms, everything became clear to him at once. Moreover, he felt that as long as he was able to reach Saint Tier, he should be able to quickly grasp Saint-level formations.

Time passed quietly, and in the blink of an eye, a few months had already passed.

***

The Eight Stones Forbidden Land, the Hu Clan.

In the instant that Ling Han stepped into the Immortal Realm, Hu Luo’s eyes immediately snapped open, anger and pain flashing over his face.

“Feng’er actually died!” He pinched his fingers and made a prediction, and after a long while, his hair involuntarily lengthened, and it seemed as if he was stunned to the extreme.

“It’s that despicable brat!

“How could this be! Going by my deductions, he should no longer have any Saint King blood essence left, while Feng’er has obtained a drop of blood essence that I personally bestowed on him, so how could he possibly die at the hands of that despicable brat?

“The link of karma cannot be faked!

“Ouyang Taishan, you old coarse fellow, it must have been you!”

Hu Luo suddenly slammed his palm on the table, and as the frightening strength washed out, hong, the room he was in was suddenly shattered to bits. A maidservant and a servant boy did not even manage to exclaim in shock when they, too, were turned to dust along with the room itself.

Finally, he regained control over his emotions. Otherwise, it would not be a matter of a single room, but rather the whole Eight Stones Forbidden Land could possibly be ruined by him in his fury.

“Grand Elder!”

“Grand Elder!”

“Grand Elder!”

Six Saints immediately appeared, and all of them looked at Hu Luo reverently. Though there were two other Saint Kings in the Hu Clan, only Hu Luo had reached the peak stage, and his battle prowess was in the category of big shots.

This was the stabilizing force of the entire Hu Clan, yet the grand elder actually flew into such a thunderous rage, which naturally stunned the others.

“The link of karma!”

“Hu Feng!”

Very quickly, they found out the reason for Hu Luo’s rage, and all of their expressions involuntarily darkened. Hu Feng was too outstanding, and they believed that he could be named a prodigy even in the Celestial Realm, yet now he had actually been killed! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ouyang Taishan previously had played mediator for that despicable brat, yet now Feng’er has died in the hands of that damn brat. I am sure it must have been Ouyang Taishan that severely injured Feng’er, and that damn brat must have taken advantage of the opening to unleash a fatal attack,” Hu Luo said menacingly, his killing intent taking solid form.
