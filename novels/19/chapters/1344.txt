Chapter 1345 This Impressive?

The divine sword slashed down. This was a Heavenly Body Tier attack, so it was incredibly powerful and frightening.

Ling Han casually waved his hand.

There was clearly no energy fluctuation, yet the might of the sword slash gradually became weaker and weaker. In the end, it became as light and weak as a gentle breeze.

The Tide of the Ages!

This wasn’t the damaged bloodline technique that had been retrieved from Ding Zizhen, but rather the true and complete celestial technique that had been retrieved from Ding Ling’s memory!

Ling Han had spent over “2000 years” to advance to the Heavenly Body Tier, and he had also used this time to fully grasp the Tide of the Ages. When he waved his hand, he clearly hadn’t created any energy fluctuations. However, he had still managed to instantly age the sword slash and completely diminish its power.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuefeng naturally wouldn’t accept death without any resistance. He was already prepared for this, and he instantly threw a punch at the sword.

Peng!

The divine sword was instantly sent flying hundreds of meters into the sky. At the same time, the evil spirit was also sent stumbling back, almost collapsing to the ground.

‘What... What in the world is going on?’

The members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace were all stunned, and Jiang Yuefeng himself was also confused. He scratched his head in confusion. Since when had he become so strong?

“Yuefeng!” Chen Di cried tears of happiness as she hugged her husband from behind. She had initially thought that this slash would take her lover away from her forever. However, her husband had unexpectedly unleashed a devastating might and battered the divine sword away. This caused joy and delight to flash across her eyes.

“Dad, you’re so powerful!” Jiang Qiaoling also yelped in astonishment. Who didn’t understand the powerful nature of this sect-protection formation and divine sword?

This being the case, was Jiang Yuefeng a Heavenly Body Tier elite? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

There was respect and fear in everyone’s eyes as they looked at Jiang Yuefeng. To the Heaven’s Sword Palace, Heavenly Body Tier elites were no different from Genesis Tier Saints. Cultivators at these tiers were all immensely powerful and invincible beings.

However, Chen Jin and the others didn’t believe this.

Jiang Yuefeng’s aura was clearly still at the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, it was only at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. If they were unable to determine even this, then they could all buy a block of tofu and smack themselves to death.

So, how was the evil spirit’s attack blocked?

Was it Ling Han?

This couldn’t be! Although he had indeed waved his hand, there hadn’t been any Origin Power fluctuation at all. So, how could he have possibly dissolved the Heavenly Body Tier attack?

Not to mention that Ling Han was only at the Sun Moon Tier, even if he were at the Heavenly Body Tier, such a feat would have still been impossible! Regardless of how powerful one was, they would still need to release their power if they were to block a strike!

Of course, this conclusion was simply the result of their ignorance and lack of knowledge. Regulations were also a part of battle prowess. Moreover, as long as the Regulations that one grasped were powerful enough, one could easily unleash a devastating might without needing to use any other power.

“Again!” Ling Kongcheng roared.

A dozen or so people instantly started to manipulate the formation and the God Tool again. The evil spirit steadied itself and launched another sword strike at Jiang Yuefeng.

Boom!

A Heavenly Body Tier pressure radiated from the sword, and it was as if even heaven and earth were about to shatter and collapse.

Jiang Yuefeng gritted his teeth and replied with another punch. This was an act of desperation as there was simply nothing else he could do.

Ling Han chuckled in his mind. He casually waved his hand and unleashed the Tide of the Ages again.

The evil spirit’s sword slash arrived before Jiang Yuefeng, yet it was as gentle and soft as a spring breeze.

Peng!

Jiang Yuefeng’s fist collided with the divine sword, and it was like a raging dragon out of the sea as it pummeled the sword back once again. His power continued to travel through the divine sword and into the evil spirit’s body, lifting it up and throwing it back through the air. The evil spirit collapsed the ground with a heavy thud.

Gasp!

Everyone was stunned by this exchange. Once could be a coincidence, but twice?

There couldn’t be so many coincidences in the world. If there were, then it wouldn’t be a coincidence anymore. It would be an expected occurrence!

Jiang Yuefeng... He could battle against Heavenly Body Tier elites!

This was incredible. One had to realize that he was only at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, yet he was actually able to battle against this evil spirit that was at the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier! Not only this, but he was even able to enjoy a huge advantage. Just how impressive was this?

‘Prodigy!’

No, a supreme supreme supreme prodigy! Not adding the two extra supremes in front would be failing to do justice to his tremendous prodigiousness!

Five-star geniuses? Heh, could they compare to Jiang Yuefeng? His battle prowess had surpassed an entire major tier! It was a whopping 16-stars!

Even Jiang Yuefeng started to question his own power. Had he woken up on the wrong side of bed and taken the wrong medication? How was he so powerful?

“Yuefeng! Although this person is your master, the relationship between you two merely spanned several hundred years. However, the sect has treated you generously and nurtured you for over 10,000 years! Moreover, you’ve already married a disciple of our Heaven’s Sword Sect. Is this not reason enough for you to support us?” Ling Kongcheng immediately asked.

In the beginning, they had merely viewed Jiang Yuefeng as a traitor. Now, however, this traitor had displayed heaven-defying power. Thus, they naturally had to change their attitude.

This kind of freakish prodigy was far too important to the Heaven’s Sword Sect. Not only could he push the Heaven’s Sword Sect to the leader’s position of the Five Sects, but he could even help them conquer more territory.

However, regardless of how gaudy and self-confident Jiang Yuefeng was, he was still extremely clear about his own strength. Battling against this evil spirit definitely wasn’t something that he could do! Thus, he turned to look at Ling Han, asking, “Master, what do you say?”

“The Five Sects have continued to refine Realm Pills for so long, and this is a crime that can’t be forgiven. They must be eliminated from existence. Otherwise, how can the generation upon generation of victims rest in peace?” Ling Han said calmly.

“This disciple understands,” Jiang Yuefeng replied respectfully.

“Detestable!” Ling Kongcheng glared at Ling Han, and said, “Mister, your surname is also Ling, so perhaps we share a common ancestor. That being the case, is there any need to take things so far?”

‘Holy f*ck! Don’t you feel shameless uttering such words?!’

Ling Han couldn’t help but say, “Old geezer, you’ve really shown me the next level of shamelessness. Fine, I’m not a bloodthirsty person, either, so why don’t you disband the Heaven’s Sword Palace from today onward? Those above the Immortal level can all cripple their own cultivation. As for those who decided to refine the Realm Pills, they must die.”

Ling Kongcheng’s expression instantly became dark. Ling Han was simply taking things too far. After all, he was also a member of the higher-ups who had decided to refine the Realm Pills in the first place.

Now, Ling Han wanted him to die, and he also wanted him to disband the Heaven’s Sword Palace. Moreover, he even wanted those above the Immortal level to cripple their own cultivation!

‘You’re f*cking dreaming!’

“If that’s your decision, then the only option is to battle to the death!” He abandoned all thoughts of resolving this peacefully. It was clear that Ling Han wasn’t planning to spare them anyway.

“Go!” he roared loudly, and the evil spirit swung the divine sword wildly as it lunged forward again.

He refused to believe that Jiang Yuefeng was truly so powerful.

After confirming that Jiang Yuefeng hadn’t been dragged into the muddy waters by the Heaven’s Sword Palace in these past 10,000 years, Ling Han naturally didn’t need to hold back any longer. He strode forward and threw a punch at the evil spirit.

This was an extremely simple punch.

Peng!

However, this punch was extremely domineering, and the power of the punch transformed into a ray of light that crashed into the evil spirit’s chest. The devastating force of this strike instantly blasted the evil spirit into pieces. Meanwhile, the divine sword also spun in the air before being caught by Ling Han. It returned to its original size of three feet long.

A violent glow immediately burst from the divine sword as it attempted to break free from Ling Han’s grasp. Sword Qi surged into the surroundings, unleashing an astonishing destructive power.

“Humph!” Ling Han humphed softly, and said, “Trying to resist?”

His physique was far too terrifying. In fact, it was even a tad more powerful than Level 10 Godly metal. Meanwhile, this divine sword was only forged from Level Eight Godly metal, so how could it break free from his grasp? The sword shuddered violently and rang in grief as it was forcefully suppressed by Ling Han.

Ling Han was ticked off by the divine sword, so he simply resorted to violent brute strength.

Pa!

The divine sword was forcefully snapped into two.

‘Holy f*cking shit!’

Everyone gasped in shock upon seeing this. In fact, their eyes were almost about to pop out of their heads.

Ling Han... He had snapped a God Tool into two with his bare hands! Just what kind of freak was he?

At this moment, everyone finally came to a realization. Sure enough, it wasn’t Jiang Yuefeng who was freakishly powerful. He was indeed just an ordinary cultivator at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. The abnormal person was this powerful freak!
