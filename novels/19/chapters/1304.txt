Chapter 1305

You can do that?

The one feeling most rueful was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

When their cultivation levels had been the same, she could easily bully Ling Han as she liked, and eventually forced Ling Han to have no choice but to step onto the path to seek out ancient sites in order to improve his abilities.

But now, not only had Ling Han become a prodigy on the level of king tier, but was even a king among kings!

With such a husband, what more could she ask for?

She smiled dazzlingly, and thought that she did not have to be so competitive in the future anymore. With such a strong shoulder for her lean on, it was really comforting.

“I forfeit!” Tuoba Dong was not a person who could not go with the flow. As a king tier, he was more able to clearly see the gap between himself and his opponent, and only with the ability to see the gap between them would he be able to continuously improve. Otherwise, even if he was a king tier, he would slowly decline to become only a top-grade prodigy, and then become an ordinary prodigy, or even become mediocre.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and said, “Yi, I seem to have used more than 10 moves.” He did not just deliver 10 punches.

Tuoba Dong smiled bitterly. Though Ling Han had not delivered just 10 strikes, every punch was done carelessly. He had not used his full power at all. He, on the other hand, had used his full battle prowess, and had only a few powerful moves that he did not use.

That was because he knew that even if he used them, it would be useless. On the contrary, it would only cause his battle prowess to drop drastically.

In any case, he had only lost this once, and still had two chances to issue a challenge. There was no need for him to fight Ling Han to the death here.

He leaped off the platform, and went to rest for a while. Like Yue Ying, he was intending to target a “pushover”.

Ling Han sat down in a cross-legged position, and waited for others to challenge him, though this was practically impossible.

The people below the platform had also begun a new round of challenges after a long rest. This time, it was even more exaggerated. Over 100 prodigies collectively gathered on a single platform, and had all cramped onto this one platform such that it was practically impenetrable.

The ones being targeted were the Cloud Maiden and Ao Ziyun.

Those that could come here were three-star geniuses at least. With so many challengers, this was really very frightening... but to no avail. The Cloud Maiden and Ao Ziyun had both cultivated the pinnacle level to perfection, and possessed the advantage of at least four stars of battle prowess. This was not something that could be compensated by over 100 people.

Ordinarily speaking, 10 people could compensate for the gap of a single star of battle prowess, but then how many people would be needed to compensate for four stars? 10 to fourth power, meaning 10,000 people! Furthermore, it was necessary for the attacks of these 10,000 people to land at the same time, and this would require a formation. Seamless cooperation was needed as well, which would make it even more difficult.

Wave after wave of attacks all ended in failure. King tiers were king tiers, after all. The gap was not something that could be filled with mere numbers.

After Tuoba Dong and Yue Ying had rested for a long enough time, they began to issue a challenge. One chose Yue Ying, while the other chose Dan Ge.

These were again two intense and exciting battles. The battle continued for a whole half day’s time before the victor was finally decided. Yue Ying won, while Tuoba Dong lost to Yang Lin.

This time, among the nine great king tiers, the Immortal Realm had occupied a total of seven places.

Taking advantage of the fact that both Yue Ying and Yang Lin were weary from a long period of battle, others grouped together to fight them again. However, a wounded tiger was still a tiger. It was definitely not something that could be defeated by a few dogs working together.

The battles continued. Aside from Ling Han, Chi Huangji, and the other kings among kings, the other five battle platforms were all very intense. To obtain a placement for themselves, they all used their ultimate moves, broadening horizons of their spectators.

Two days’ time passed very fast. Dan Ge became the first king tier to be completely disqualified, and after another few hours, Yue Ying became the second. This time, the dust had settled, and there was indeed no doubt the candidates for the Nine Kings were confirmed.

It was impossible anyone would be able to shake the positions of these nine people.

Even a Heavenly Body Tier like Zuo Quan could only bow his head here. Being weakened to the level of the Mountain River Tier, he was completely no match for the king tiers of the young generation.

...Was that really the case?

Ling Han smiled faintly. He was still waiting, and when there was about an hour left, he nodded at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden understood his signal, and ascended onto the platform with a leap. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘What in the world is going on?’

Everyone was shocked. There was actually someone who dared to issue a challenge at this time? Furthermore, the one being challenged was actually Ling Han—he was a king among kings!

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden made a move, and a pair of phoenix’s wings spread open. Fiery flames blazed.

“Ah!” Ling Han screamed out, instantly falling off the platform.

‘F*ck!’

When they saw this scene, everyone could feel a cold sweat.

‘She hasn’t even touched you, and you’re already screaming?’

That was a little too fake, wasn’t it? It was obviously done deliberately!

No one was stupid in this place, and immediately guessed that Ling Han had lost deliberately to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Furthermore, at this time, the time limit of three days was about up. Then, Ling Han’s intention was extremely obvious—he wanted to guarantee a place of king tier for this woman.

However, this was a chance!

When they saw the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden replace Ling, everyone felt a moment of elation. But the problem now was the majority of them had used up their three chances of challenging, and now could only watch from the sidelines.

On the other hand, there were still some people who had not used all their three chances, but their abilities were obviously much weaker. That was why they were willing to become mere spectators. The reason they had come here was mainly to observe the battles between prodigies so that they could gain appreciation and inspiration.

They ascended the platform to battle, but the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was no weakling. Though she had not cultivated to pinnacle level, once she awoke her Cloud Phoenix bloodline, she could forcefully gain the battle prowess of the early stage of the pinnacle level, so she was considerably powerful.

She firmly occupied this platform that she had obtained through little difficulty, guarding the gift that Ling Han had given her.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was standing underneath the platform. He was waiting for time to pass so that he could issue a challenge again.

After he fell off the platform, he realized that there was a black-colored line on his hand, and a black-colored aura was enshrouding him, causing him to be unable to move.

After 15 minutes, the black-colored aura disappeared, but the black line did not.

Obviously, the black-colored aura forced him to be able to continue challenging only after 15 minutes, while the black line symbolized that he had lost once. If three lines appeared, he would no longer be able to ascend the platform and battle.

Ling Han looked towards Ao Ziyun, and broke into a grin.

‘F***!’ Ao Ziyun instantly cursed internally. He had not even finished the thought when he saw that Ling Han had already shot upwards, and was now standing right in front of him.

At this moment, the anguish in Ao Ziyun’s heart was indescribably colossal.

He had guarded his platform until now with so much difficulty, and it looked like he was just about to succeed, yet all of a sudden, he had met such a demon like Ling Han.

‘You are really too f****** mean. You deliberately lost to your own woman so you could get an additional placement!’

Yet, unfortunately, Ling Han had that type of power.

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’

Thoughts streamed through Ao Ziyun’s head rapidly, and he immediately aimed to leap off the platform. There was still more than 15 minutes from the deadline of three days at present, and he had only lost once. Then, if he immediately admitted defeat and waited 15 minutes, he would be able to make a move on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and regain his placement.

“Hoho, what’s all the rush!” Ling Han moved. Pa, with a single move, Ao Ziyun was sent flying backwards.

Fu*k!

A muscle twitched in Ao Ziyun’s cheek. ‘You are too ruthless, aren’t you? Can’t I even choose not to fight you?’

“I forfeit!” he called out loudly.

To be blessed by fortune, he did not mind losing a little face.

“None of my business!” Ling Han shook his head, and shot out a punch at Ao Ziyun. “If I want to beat you, I will!”

Peng, peng, peng. Ao Ziyun had no choice but to parry, and had completely no chance to get off the platform.

He wanted to lose, but he couldn’t even do that?

Everyone couldn’t help but be amused from watching, and felt that the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering this time round was finally more interesting than in the past.
