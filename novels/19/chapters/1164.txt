Chapter 1165: Good Faith

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han hesitated for a moment. However, upon recalling how the Mo Clan had helped him, he didn’t hide the truth, and said, “That’s right, I’m going to refine pills myself.”

The elder was astonished, and the smile on his face grew even larger. “Young Master Han, this elder wants to do some business with you... that’s right, my surname is also Han. What a coincidence! My name in just a single word, Huo.”

“Oh, so it’s Manager Han.” Ling Han greeted the elder before saying, “What business does Manager Han want to do with me?”

“I can give you a few pill recipes free of charge. However, when you succeed in refining the alchemical pills, I hope that you can sell them through us.”

Ling Han faltered for a moment before feeling a sense of admiration for Han Huo.

‘As expected of a businessman.’

It looked like Manager Han was being extremely generous, but this wasn’t entirely the case. Pill recipes were indeed a type of resource, though it could be argued that it was a worthless type of resource. After all, it was extremely easy to make copies of pill recipes. Thus, there was actually no loss for the Mo Clan Establishment in it.

Moreover, even if they didn’t make a cent off selling Ling Han’s pills, they could still bring in a huge customer flow.

Pills were essential goods to cultivators. Also, since cultivators came to buy pills, perhaps they would also buy some other items along the way. Even if they bought just one more item, the Mo Clan Establishment would still have made a profit.

In addition, they would become acquainted with Ling Han, a super-genius, just for the price of a few pill recipes—which they wouldn’t lose money off anyway. There was absolutely no loss for the Mo Clan Establishment.

‘No wonder the Mo Clan is able to spread its establishments throughout the galaxy. They’re indeed good at seizing opportunities and acting in good faith.’

However, Han Huo didn’t know just how important his sincere offer was, nor did he know just how much help he would bring the establishment. Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “No problem! Then I’ll thank Manager Han for the pill recipes first!”

Han Huo was delighted upon hearing Ling Han’s reply. In reality, he hadn’t given this as much thought as Ling Han had—he had merely wanted to become acquainted and be on good terms with Ling Han. After all, this was a profitable agreement, and they could also acquaint themselves with a young king tier on top of that.

As for Ling Han saying that he could refine pills, Manager Han didn’t actually take this to heart. After all, how could someone be so prodigious? If one had such terrifying cultivation ability, they wouldn’t also be a genius in alchemy, right?

Thus, saying that he would sell pills for Ling Han was naturally just a polite way of flattering him.

“What level pill recipe does Young Master Han want?” Han Huo asked.

“Level Five,” Ling Han replied. He could already refine Level Four Divine Pills, and thus his next target was obviously refining Level Five Divine Pills.

Han Huo was taken aback with surprise. ‘Level Five?!

‘If you want to muck around, Level One Divine Pills are already more than enough. What’s the point of playing with Level Five Divine Pills? Even if you’re a seed of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and even if you receive a lot of resources, alchemy will suck your resources dry in no time at all. This is especially the case with high-grade alchemical pills.’

Ling Han smiled widely as he retrieved a pill vial and handed it to Manager Han. “These are Mysterious Azure Pills and Jade Heaven Pills that I’ve refined. If you could please sell them for me, Manager Han.”

Han Huo was a little baffled as he accepted the pill vial. Only after staring at them for a while did he realize that Ling Han wasn’t kidding around.

Mysterious Azure Pill... This was a Level Four Divine Pill!

‘Gasp! Could it be that Han Lin is genuinely an alchemist? And a high-ranked one at that?’

He didn’t dare treat this matter lightly, and he hurriedly opened the vials and carefully appraised the pills.

The Mo Clan Establishment sold everything and anything, so Han Huo naturally knew a lot about alchemy. He immediately determined that these pills were exactly what Ling Han had said they were. They were indeed real.

‘Did Han Lin truly refine these?’

Han Huo chose to believe the affirmative. He was actively trying to acquaint the Mo Clan Establishment with Ling Han anyway, wasn’t he? He nodded, and said, “Please wait for a moment, Young Master Han. I’ll retrieve the pill recipes for you right away. These are fairly valuable pill recipes, so I don’t keep them on me lest I accidentally lose them.”

“No worries. I understand, Manager Han.”

Han Huo returned after a while, and he handed a small booklet to Ling Han.

Ling Han accepted it and glanced at the cover, on which the words “Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill” were printed. He roughly skimmed over its contents and found that the booklet was all about the materials needed and the refinement process of the Seven Extreme Flying Flame Pill. In fact, the refinement process took up 90% of the booklet.

The refinement process of high-grade Divine Pills was extremely complex. As such, it wasn’t abnormal for such pill recipes to take up an entire booklet.

‘The Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill can elevate the battle prowess of those who practice fire-element cultivation techniques by two stars... Two stars!’ Ling Han was astonished when he read the introduction of the pill. One had to realize that most cultivators were only run-of-the-mill ones—surpassing one star was already impossibly difficult, let alone surpassing two stars.

Although this pill wasn’t helpful to his cultivation, he didn’t require Level Five Divine Pills yet anyway. However, if he succeeded in refining this pill, they would definitely be treated as treasures by those who practiced fire-element cultivation techniques.

Moreover, Sun Moon Tier elites definitely weren’t short on money—they could afford to buy these pills.

“Young Master Han, what do you think about this pill recipe?” Han Huo asked.

“It’s fine!” Ling Han said with a nod.

“Just a word of warning, Young Master Han. This Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill is extremely difficult to refine. I’ve heard that even many level six alchemists can’t refine this pill. So, please don’t spend too much time on this pill. After all, Young Master Han is a cultivation prodigy.”

“I understand,” Ling Han said. Manager Han was telling him that out of goodwill, so he naturally wouldn’t become angry. Moreover, his words were indeed true. At the end of the day, cultivation was still the most important.

However, little did Han Huo know that Ling Han actually possessed a Reincarnation Tree. This was a heaven-defying divine tree!

They started to discuss the fine details of their collaboration—of course, all of this was built on the assumption that Ling Han could successfully refine the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill.

Han Huo didn’t have much confidence in Ling Han, and thus he offered him a large cut of the profits—90%, to be exact. He had initially planned to give all of the profits to Ling Han, and it was actually Ling Han who had taken a step back and offered them 10% of the profits.

Han Huo genuinely didn’t believe that Ling Han could succeed. Thus, he naturally didn’t mind giving all of the profits away. It was just thin air, after all.

Ling Han needed an exorbitant amount of True Origin Stones as he needed to purchase Godly metal to raise the level of his Divine Demon Sword. That being the case, he purchased the materials needed for refining the Seven Ultimate Flying Flame Pill, and then returned to the Majestic Heaven Sect.

He immediately entered the Black Tower to comprehend the pill recipe under the Reincarnation Tree.

The steps to pill refinement were actually very easy to grasp. This simply involved the order of placing ingredients, as well as how to control the flames. Even ordinary people could follow these steps. Even if the steps were more difficult, grasping them was still only a matter of time. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, making the divine patterns of the ingredients intertwine was much more difficult, and was not something that anyone could do. Only those with a powerful divine sense and meticulous control could complete this process.

In fact, this process involved millions upon billions of possible variations. As such, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to grasp this process even if they spent their entire lives studying it. Even level five and level six alchemists would need hundreds of years to fully grasp it.

Thus, it was only understandable that Han Huo doubted Ling Han’s ability to successfully refine this pill in the short term.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was brimming with confidence. He had the Reincarnation Tree!

The leaves of the Reincarnation Tree rustled, and Ling Han entered a state of meditation. He simulated the pill refinement process in his mind again and again, again and again.

One day, two days, three days... Time quietly crept by.
