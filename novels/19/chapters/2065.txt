Chapter 2066: Cooperation of Ling Han and Ji Wuming

By teaming up, Ling Han and Ji Wuming had essentially become the sturdiest shield and sharpest spear in the world. This was a perfect team.

Even though Tian Qingyue and the others were top-notch monarch tiers, and even though they had a significant advantage in cultivation level, they were still helpless against Ling Han’s incredibly powerful physique. Meanwhile, Ji Wuming’s attacks were like relentless waves that surged forth one after another. His attacks were like water that penetrated every single gap.

The four monarch tiers were in a miserable and disheveled state. Surprisingly, all of them were already drenched in blood. Ji Wuming had grasped heaven knew how many powerful celestial techniques, and thus he was able to wantonly unleash them one after another. This caused the monarch tiers to face a mountain-load of pressure.

“Defense! Focus on defense!” Tian Qingyue hurriedly shouted. Otherwise, they would be on the back foot and face continuous attacks from Ji Wuming. If this continued, they would eventually be exhausted to death.

The four monarch tiers immediately joined hands to defend, and this greatly improved their situation.

Regardless of how powerful Ji Wuming’s attacks were, how could he possibly breach the combined defenses of four monarch tiers?

After all, Ji Wuming was only at Yang Soul. If he were at Heaven Soul, and if he didn’t need to concentrate on defending, he would definitely be able to shatter the combined defenses of the four monarch tiers with ease.

Upon focusing on defense, the four monarch tiers managed to immediately stabilize their situation. They then started to plan a counterattack.

This was a great test for Ling Han.

Just then, they had been mindlessly attacking, so Ling Han had also been able to mindlessly defend. In any case, he would simply block any attack that came his way. Now, however, the four monarch tiers were only launching attacks from time to time. This was, in fact, even harder to defend against. Ling Han needed to be completely focused. Otherwise, if he allowed an attack to strike Ji Wuming, that might lead to great catastrophe.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel strange. In the past, he and Ji Wuming had always been trying to kill each other. Moreover, their killing intent had been extremely resolute. Now, however, they were happily teaming up with each other, and Ji Wuming was even entrusting his back to Ling Han. This was something that Ling Han could never have dreamed of.

“Do you think this is useful?” Ji Wuming asked in a baleful voice. He shook his right hand, drawing a sword that was radiating with an ice-cold aura.

Celestial Tool, Severed Passion Sword!

Whoosh!

The sword slashed down, with its might shaking the heavens.

This was a Celestial Tool, so even if it hadn’t awakened, just its sharpness alone was already enough to greatly threaten those under the level of Celestial King. Unless one were significantly more powerful, and unless they could knock the Celestial Tool out of their opponent’s hand with a single strike, this would be an unbelievably powerful and deadly weapon.

Was Ling Han’s physique powerful enough? Yet, he still didn’t dare to let himself be struck by the Severed Passion Sword.

The sword slashed down, and the expressions of the four monarch tiers changed drastically. They frantically shot back in retreat.

Just what kind of f*cking Pseudo-Celestial Tool was this? How was it so terrifying?

“No, this isn’t a Pseudo-Celestial Tool… It’s a genuine Celestial Tool!” Tian Qingyue suddenly exclaimed in astonishment.

“What?!” Xia Houtong and the others were stunned upon hearing this.

A Celestial Tool!

Celestial Tools were treasures that uniquely belonged to Celestial Kings. In fact, some Celestial Kings didn’t even own any Celestial Tools! Only powerful Celestial Kings could possibly own such a weapon. This was a symbol of status and power.

Now, however, a measly Yang Soul cultivator actually possessed a Celestial Tool?

Who could believe this?

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

The Severed Passion Sword continued to slash down, sending waves of Sword Qi through the air. The might of this Sword Qi was no weaker than the might of the blade itself.

The combined defense of the four monarch tiers was instantly shattered. Like a husband and wife facing great calamity, they each fled their own separate ways.

Who could resist the might of a Celestial Tool?

Of course, this was unless an Immortal Palace Tier elite arrived. They didn’t need to be at the Fourth Secret or Fifth Secret, and they simply needed to be at the First Secret. After all, Immortal Palace Tier elites possessed a crushing advantage over Dividing Soul Tier cultivators. What did it matter that the four monarch tiers were extremely powerful? Before a First Secret elite, they couldn’t even block a single attack. Similarly, the attack of a First Secret elite could instantly knock the Celestial Sword from Ji Wuming’s hand.

No, with a single punch, Ji Wuming would immediately be reduced into a cloud of blood, upon which his Celestial Tool would clatter on the ground.

Now, however, the four monarch tiers could only flee in disarray. With Ling Han acting as a human shield, they simply had no way of attacking and suppressing Ji Wuming. Apart from fleeing, what else could they do?

The eyes of their followers widened in shock and disbelief.

How was this possible?! Just how in the world was this possible?!

In terms of cultivation level, the four monarch tiers were all at Heaven Soul, which possessed a crushing advantage over Yang Soul. In terms of natural talent, Tian Qingyue and the others were all top-notch monarch tiers. Thus, how could they be surpassed? Meanwhile, in terms of numbers, they were also enjoying an advantage of four to two.

Yet, even so, they were still suppressed and forced to scurry around like rats. They were like dogs without a home.

Heavens! Ling Han and Ji Wuming were far too powerful!

As expected of paramount prodigies who had ascended the Most Venerable Divine Path. They had forcefully turned an impossibility into a possibility.

When the four monarch tiers had ascended the golden dragon bridge, one of them had the potential to become an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. Now, however? Even the Most Venerable Divine Path had been triggered, and it had more so been triggered by two people. Just what kind of devastating individuals would they become?

The onlookers could only draw a sharp breath. Their heads were numb with shock. Perhaps they were witnessing the rise of two paramount emperors.

“Retreat!” The four monarch tiers abandoned any remaining hope. They couldn’t breach Ling Han’s defenses, and they were also being completely smashed by Ji Wuming’s attacks. As such, what was the point of continuing this battle?

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Tian Qingyue and the others fled in four separate directions.

Ling Han and Ji Wuming didn’t chase after them. First of all, their speed was similar, so they couldn’t necessarily catch up anyway. Second of all, this was potentially a trap set up by the four monarch tiers. It was possible that they would fall into a trap if they gave chase.

“Ling Han, if it weren’t for the fact that I have a strong reason to kill you, I would have truly wanted to become friends with you,” Ji Wuming said as he sheathed his Severed Passion Sword. He didn’t seize this opportunity to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Same!”

The battle just then had truly been thrilling and mesmerizing.

“Next time we meet, I’ll unleash my full power to kill you!” Ji Wuming said, his voice suddenly turning cold. His eyes were radiating with powerful killing intent.

“You better pray that you won’t be crushed into oblivion by me,” Ling Han retorted. He didn’t back down at all.

Ji Wuming roared with laughter. He wasn’t sneering at Ling Han’s audacity, but he was instead appreciating the strength and resolve of his opponent. He flicked his sleeves and walked into the canyon.

Ling Han gazed at his disappearing figure for a moment before saying, “Let’s enter as well.”

The Empress and the others nodded in reply, and their eyes were filled with emotion as they gazed at Ling Han. This man was far too mighty and domineering. This caused their hearts to flutter in excitement. In fact, they felt a powerful urge to leap into his embrace, and they yearned for him to passionately kiss them and make love with them.

The four of them entered the canyon. However, they didn’t follow Ji Wuming. This canyon was extremely large, so there was absolutely no need to choose the same path.

Whoosh!

Only after entering the canyon did they realize just how powerful the wind was. While standing outside the canyon just then, they had only been able to sense a wisp of the wind’s might. Now, however, they could feel the vicious intent of the wind. With each gust of wind, rocks and dust would surge through the surroundings. It was as if some elite had launched a powerful attack.

Moreover, even with Ling Han’s powerful physique, he still couldn’t help but feel pain from the violently flying rocks. After facing several hits head-on, he didn’t dare to expose himself anymore. He activated a movement technique, and started to dance around the flying rocks.

Meanwhile, they also had to collect these flying rocks as the latter might possess traces of Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, with the relentless gusts of vicious winds, it was truly hard to collect the rocks. Trying to grab these rocks was like trying to face the powerful attack of an elite head-on. It would shake them to the core and make them want to spit blood.

Thus, Ling Han and the others only managed to roam around the canyon for a single day. Afterward, they had no choice but to return to the Azure Dragon Town to rest.
