Chapter 2621: The Might of Lightning

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The five people also saw Ling Han and his two wives, and when they glanced over, their gazes all stopped on the Empress.

The Empress’ beauty was simply breathtaking.

The Seventh Heaven Celestial King immediately walked over in an elegant manner, saying, “Hi, I’m Wan Gaojie. May I please know your name, beautiful lady?”

The Empress directly ignored him, only replying with a disgusted expression.

If she were Ling Han, Wan Gaojie would definitely explode with killing intent and directly charge forward to kill him. However, the Empress was an aloof beauty, so her temperament and expression instead caused Wan Gaojie’s heart to itch. He even more so wanted to win over this thorny rose.

“Celestial maiden, Young Master Wan is the son of Wan Chengbai!” someone beside the Seventh Heaven Celestial King said.

“Lord Wan Chengbai is a Ninth Heaven monarch star, and he’s one of the first people who entered the Celestial King Graveyard. He’s powerful enough to defeat a large city all by himself!”

“To catch the eye of Young Master Wan is a fortune of three lifetimes!”

“Moreover, Young Master Wan is also a Seventh Heaven monarch tier himself, so he’s destined to become a Ninth Heaven Heavenly Emperor in the future. Where else are you going to find such a talented person?”

Wan Gaojie feigned modesty, waving his hands and saying, “It’s nothing, I’m merely enjoying the fortune of my father.”

“Aiyah, you’re too modest, Young Master Wan!”

“If I had been Young Master Wan, I would’ve already become as high profile as could be! Only Young Master Wan can remain so modest.” The four people continued to praise their leader.

Meanwhile, the woman’s face was filled with jealousy, and she said, “Say, young lady, it’s not good to be so reserved. If you miss this opportunity, it might never come by again!”

Ling Han sighed, saying, “Are you people finished?”

The five people were blabbering on without pause, and Ling Han couldn’t help but interject.

Wan Gaojie scoffed upon hearing this. A measly Fifth Heaven Celestial King didn’t deserve any of his attention. However, he still had to feign modesty before the Empress, so he said, “Friend, how should I refer to you?”

He was afraid that Ling Han was the Empress’ relative, in which case it would be a bad idea to offend him.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “It doesn’t matter who I am, nor do I have the time to deal with you people. Stop buzzing around like flies. You might not find it annoying, but we do!”

‘Flies?’

Wan Gaojie and the others flared up in rage. He actually dared to call them flies?

“Such audacity!” one of the Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings said in a baleful voice. “Young Master Wan might be a cordial person, but that doesn’t mean that I am too! Hmph! If you’re not taught a lesson, you truly won’t know the heights of this heaven!”

He immediately lashed out, launching a palm strike at Ling Han.

His attack was filled with a sense of contempt toward Ling Han. Indeed, his smack was treating Ling Han as if he were a weakling.

A cold glint flashed across Ling Han’s eyes as he replied with a casual palm strike of his own.

“Hah, don’t overestimate yourself!” the Fifth Heaven Celestial King said in a cold voice. Even though he was only an emperor tier, the cultivation technique that he practiced was extremely profound. Thus, his battle prowess was far superior to that of ordinary Fifth Heaven emperor tiers.

The two palms quickly collided.

Peng!

One of the palms immediately shattered, while the other remained completely unaffected, continuing to surge forward.

Pu!

The Fifth Heaven Celestial King screamed in agony. Opening his mouth, he instantly spat out a mouthful of blood. In fact, he couldn’t stop vomiting blood, and in the end, even his internal organs were vomited out.

He wore an aggrieved expression as he looked at the others, and with a flop of his head, he directly collapsed to the ground, dead.

‘This…!’

Wan Gaojie and the three others were transfixed with shock. In a battle at the same cultivation level, this Fifth Heaven Celestial King had actually been this weak? He had been killed with a single strike?

“Very well! Very courageous of you!” Wan Gaojie said in a baleful voice. Even if Ling Han were the Empress’ brother, he would still capture him no matter what. Otherwise, wouldn’t his followers become disillusioned?

He stepped forward and grabbed at Ling Han.

Wan Gaojie was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, so it was only natural that he should succeed.

However, Ling Han remained unfazed as he channeled the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning. Arcs of azure lightning appeared on his right hand, and he again threw a casual palm strike at Wan Gaojie.

“You’re seeking death!” Wan Gaojie said with a cold sneer. A measly Fifth Heaven Celestial King actually dared to attack a Seventh Heaven Celestial King head-on? Just how arrogant was this?

He channeled a secret technique, aiming to kill Ling Han with a single strike.

Ling Han smiled faintly. Which of them was truly seeking death?

Pa!

The two large hands clashed, instantly releasing a devastating shock wave that surged into the surroundings.

Wan Gaojie suddenly felt an overwhelming force rush over, causing him to involuntarily fly backward. Agonizing pain then shot up his right arm, and looking down, all he could see was a swathe of blood.

Arcs of azure lightning chaotically flashed around, climbing up his arm.

He was absolutely stupefied. With his battle prowess at the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven, only those with a battle prowess at the Eighth Heaven could break his hand with a single strike, right?

But, this was only a Fifth Heaven Celestial King?

Wan Gaojie crashed to the ground, his body convulsing in indescribable pain and discomfort.

The three remaining people were speechless with shock. They could barely accept—or even begin to imagine—what they were seeing.

“How can you possibly be so strong?!” Wan Gaojie exclaimed as he crawled up. His eyes were filled with terror and jealousy as he stared at Ling Han.

Just then, he had felt the creeping danger of death. However, the fact that a Fifth Heaven Celestial King was so powerful also caused him to be filled with jealousy. If he could also possess such battle prowess… wouldn’t he be able to ignore the threat of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “If I’m not powerful enough, how am I going to protect my lovers? And how am I going to exterminate rascals like you?”

‘Rascal?’

Wan Gaojie almost went crazy with rage. He was a Seventh Heaven monarch tier! He was more so the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate! Yet, this person dared to call him a rascal?

He wore a baleful expression as he looked at Ling Han. As long as he managed to flee, he would look for his father, and request him to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “You’re already in my hands, yet you still want to leave this place alive?”

Wan Gaojie humphed upon hearing this. Celestial Kings were extremely difficult to kill. Even if he were slightly weaker than Ling Han, the gap between them would only be one minor level at most. Thus, if he was intent on fleeing, how could Ling Han possibly stop him?

“I’ll remember this!” Wan Gaojie said with clenched teeth. After saying this, he immediately leaped forward.

Boom!

He immediately shot off at an astonishing speed.

“Go!” Ling Han didn’t give chase. Instead, he simply raised his right hand.

Crackle!

An arc of azure lightning transformed into a spear, which Ling Han then launched forward. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The lightning spear was astonishingly quick, catching up to Wan Gaojie in a flash. It then pierced into his back, forcefully nailing him to the ground.

“Aaah!” Wan Gaojie screamed in agony. His heart was brutally penetrated by the devastating power of the lightning, and this lightning was more so chaotic as it coursed through his body. He felt as if he were being dismembered.

“H-hurry up and release Young Master Wan! He’s the only son of Lord Wan Chengbai! If you kill him, your entire clan will be massacred!” The three remaining people immediately started to threaten Ling Han.

“Hmph!” Ling Han replied with a wave of his right hand.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Another three lightning spears flew forth, nailing all three people to the ground.

These people were far weaker than Wan Gaojie, and their life force was instantly wiped out by the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning.

Lightning—this represented the punishment of heaven and earth; this was the symbol of destruction and chaos. If Wan Gaojie hadn’t been a powerful Seventh Heaven monarch tier, he would have already become a corpse.

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said, appearing slightly bored. Following his advance in cultivation, those who could rival him also became fewer and fewer in number.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou nodded before following after him.

Only a long time after they left did Wan Gaojie’s head finally droop to the side, his vitality extinguished.
