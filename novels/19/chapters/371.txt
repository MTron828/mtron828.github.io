Chapter 372: An Exorbitant Demand

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“Call your boss out,” the young man commanded in a very haughty tone. There were two attendants behind him, and both in the Spiritual Ocean Tier.

In the Extreme Yang City, though the Spiritual Ocean Tier could not be considered as top-tier elites, they were not such commonplace thugs that a wave of a hand could gather a whole bunch of them, either. Thus, this young man should have quite a high social status, and was definitely no ordinary commoner.

The waiter hurriedly went to ask for the manager. The manager stepped out to talk with the young man, but was also waved off by the latter. He insisted that they find someone who could really make decisions in this place to talk to him.

As a result, Liu Yu Tong appeared to meet him.

When the young man saw Liu Yu Tong, his eyes lit up unconsciously. There were indeed many beautiful women in this world, but there were not many that were beautiful to the extent Liu Yu Tong was. Furthermore, such an extraordinary beauty was even in the higher ranks of the Gushing Spring Tier—she was rare goods.

“I go by the surname Lang, and my name is Jun Cai.” The young man withdrew his arrogant attitude and put on a refined and courteous manner.

“What guidance would Mr Lang like to offer?” Liu Yu Tong asked tonelessly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lang Jun Cai smiled slightly and asked, “How may I address you, Miss?”

This person had extremely thick skin, and was not someone that could be easily dealt with.

Liu Yu Tong thought for a moment, then replied, “Liu.”

Lang Jun Cai was rebuffed neither gently nor roughly, yet did not get angry. He offered an open-mouthed smile. With teeth as white as snow, together with a handsome face, he looked very dashing. He said, “Miss Liu, I would like to make a business deal with you.”

“What kind of business deal?”

“I would like to have 50% of the profits of ‘Forget Not’,” Lang Jun Cai made an exorbitant demand.

Liu Yu Tong laughed in spite of herself and asked, “Is Mr Lang joking?”

Lang Jun Cai shook his head and smiled gracefully. “Don’t think that I am greedy. In truth, I originally wanted to ask for 70% of the profits, but for the sake of Miss Liu, I decided to cut down to 50%.” He immediately folded his arms over his chest and continued, “Please listen to what I can do for you first, Miss Liu.

“The Extreme Yang City is a huge cake that contains an astonishing amount of profits in it. However, this cake has already long been divided and distributed, and with Miss Liu’s forceful interference and getting a slice of your own now, this will make a considerable number of people displeased.

“Among these people, there are some that possess incredible power. Even with just a flick of a finger, they could make this restaurant suddenly collapse tomorrow.

“So, Miss Liu needs me.

“At the very least, I have some face in this Extreme Yang City. Thus, once you hang up the sign of the Lang Clan, I believe that there would be no one in the Extreme Yang City who would dare touch a chair or table here!

“Half the profits versus losing everything; for such a simple choice, Miss Liu should be clear on what to do, right?”

When he was finished speaking, Lang Jun Cai looked smilingly at Liu Yu Tong. Today, he only asked for 50% of the profits, but tomorrow, he would make this beauty into a captive beneath him, and by then, naturally, all the profits would belong to him.

Liu Yu Tong’s expression changed slightly. She came from a great clan, so she naturally knew that with the prosperous business Forget Not was making now, it would definitely attract covetous eyes. However, she had never thought that his day would come so fast.

Since Ling Han had handed the restaurant for her to manage, unless it was a last resort, she did not want to disturb Ling Han. As a result, she asked, “Mr Lang, could it be that laws do not exist in the Extreme Yang City?”

“They do. However, the law would only protect a limited number of people, such as my Lang Clan. For now, at least, Miss Liu is not under the protection of the law. Only when you enter the camp of my Lang Clan will you get similar protection,” Lang Jun Cai said with a smile, admiring Liu Yu Tong’s delicate features. He was definitely going to get hold of this beauty.

Liu Yu Tong suppressed the anger she was feeling, and stated calmly, “I’m afraid Mr Lang is being too overconfident.”

“Oh, you don’t believe me?” Lang Jun Cai asked, smiling. He did not think that a few words would be able to conquer Liu Yu Tong. “You can make your own investigation and find out what my Lang Clan represents in this Extreme Yang City. Additionally, from tomorrow onwards, it would be best for the restaurant to close temporarily. Whenever you agree to my conditions, you can come find me at Listen to the Rain Pavilion. I am there most of the time.”

He stood and said, “I’ll beg my leave then.”

“I won’t bother to see you out!” Liu Yu Tong said coolly.

The moment Lang Jun Cai left, Liu Yu Tong immediately went to make enquiries about the Lang Clan. The result made her frown.

The Lang Clan was a party at the level of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Though it was not one of the top clans in the Extreme Yang City, they possessed their own space in the society. More importantly, the Lang Clan was a vassal clan of an Earth Grade alchemist in the North Pill Pavilion 1 , and that was the real source of confidence for Lang Jun Cai to make such a ridiculous demand.

Could it be that Ling Han had to use the name of an Earth Grade alchemist to suppress Lang Jun Cai?

That would really be like using an ox cleaver to kill a chicken—that would really lower his status.

But who asked Ling Han to currently have too few people he could actually use effectively by his side? At first, Guang Yuan had already broken through to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, but his cultivation level had fallen dramatically now. If one was considering the strongest in their group, that would actually be Ling Han, an Earth Grade alchemist, and the next strongest was a little girl of five or six, Hu Niu.

Liu Yu Tong sighed. The main thing was that Ling Han’s alchemy had improved too quickly, and the power of those by his side could not catch up at all. Otherwise, an Earth Grade alchemist would at least have a large number of Spiritual Pedestal Tier elites following by his side, and it would not be strange for even a few Flower Blossom Tier elites to appear at his side.

She pondered the issue for a while, but still decided to inform Ling Han of this matter, because she was not able to settle this issue at all.

“Oh, a fly?” Ling Han’s mouth twitched. He said, “It’s all right. I will go and sit at the restaurant personally tomorrow. I’d like to see how arrogant he can be.”

Liu Yu Tong nodded. At worst, Ling Han could just reveal his identity as an Earth Grade alchemist, and at that time, there would be no worries that Lang Jun Cai would not kneel in front of Ling Han and beg for his forgiveness with fear and trepidation.

The night passed. Early the next morning, Ling Han brought with him Guang Yuan, Can Ye, and Zhu Wu Jiu to the restaurant. As for Hu Niu, there was of course no way he could leave her behind.

At the beginning, everything was normal. However, when it was about noon and time for lunch, a few groups of black-clad people came to the restaurant. They did not order any dishes, but simply sat down at various tables.

These black-clad people were not ordinary customers. Most of them were in the Gushing Spring Tier, and there were a small number in the Spiritual Ocean Tier. It would not attract anyone’s attention if there was only one or two of them, but with such numbers, the moment ordinary customers entered, they would turn around and leave.

These people’s auras were too overbearing. Even the waiters did not dare step up to urge them to make their orders or leave. All the way until noon, there was not even a bit of business in the restaurant left.

“These people must have been sent by Lang Jun Cai to make trouble!” Liu Yu Tong said furiously.

Ling Han smiled and said, “Firstly, they are here to ruin our business, and secondly, they are here to show off their might. To be able to mobilize so many Spiritual Ocean Tier and Gushing Spring Tier elites, hoho, this Lang Jun Cai is indeed a scheming character.”

“What do we do? Do we have Hu Niu go and chase them off?” Liu Yu Tong asked.

Hu Niu instantly grinned. Violence was her favorite activity, but Ling Han usually did not allow her to get into fights.

Ling Han smiled and said, “Diplomacy before violence. We are doing business here, so we should be amiable, which would attract riches.” As he spoke, he descended down the stairs from the second floor.

Liu Yu Tong could not help but roll her eyes. Being amiable to attract riches? From the killing intent all over Ling Han’s face, he looked more like he was about to go on a killing spree.
