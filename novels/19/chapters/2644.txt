Chapter 2645: Fourth Land of Inheritance

‘How is he so quick?!’

The Eighth Heaven Celestial King was both astonished and terrified. He had clearly moved before Ling Han, yet Ling Han had already appeared before him?

“Why are you fleeing?” Ling Han asked.

‘This…’

!!

The Eighth Heaven Celestial King’s eyes darted around for a moment before he replied, “This junior’s bladder is about to burst, so I wanted to find somewhere to relieve myself.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. This person was indeed shameless, shameless to the extreme.

Ling Han harbored no good feelings toward those in the Celestial King Graveyard, and even less so now that they were affected by the black energy. Even though this person appeared honest and respectful now, this was merely because Ling Han was more powerful than him.

If their positions had been reversed, this Eighth Heaven Celestial King would have definitely revealed his fangs already.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “Since you’ve come to kill the outsider that I am, why don’t you attack?”

The Eighth Heaven Celestial King hurriedly shook his head, saying, “Senior, you truly like to joke! How could a mighty and powerful person such as yourself possibly be an outsider? You’re definitely one of us!”

Ling Han felt speechless. He casually swung his sword, causing the Eighth Heaven Celestial King to hurriedly stumble back in fright.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

His attacks became faster and faster, and the Eighth Heaven Celestial King only managed to dodge three strikes before being sliced into two.

Swoosh!

Ling Han leaped into the air, and immediately soared into the distance.

After making it far away enough, he entered the Celestial Guest Residence.

Even though he appeared mighty and invincible, the wounds that he had suffered before were no laughing matter. It was only because his fighting spirit had been far too ferocious that he had suppressed these wounds the entire time.

Now that his enemies had been exterminated, he naturally needed to take a rest to heal his wounds.

This rest lasted an entire 130,000 years.

Ling Han was not only recovering from his wounds, but he was also using this opportunity to stabilize his cultivation. With the acceleration of time, this 130,000 years was also transformed into 130,000,000 years. Thus, his cultivation was naturally stabilized. In fact, he even made some further progress.

This kind of brutal battle where they exchanged wounds and risked their lives was most beneficial to elevating their cultivation. Of course, the prerequisite was that they weren’t killed or wounded too severely.

The Empress also managed to stabilize her cultivation. Moreover, because she had no wounds to recover from, her advancement was even quicker than Ling Han’s. However, the difference wasn’t that great. After all, at the Sixth Heaven, unless they had the help of some Great Herb, it might require hundreds of billions of years to advance a single level. Thus, what was over 100,000,000 years in this context?

Ling Han and the Empress held hands as they exited the Celestial Guest Residence. Their adventure in this place had yet to conclude.

During this time, Ling Han had naturally fed Gu Heyi’s Celestial Tool to the Divine Demon Sword as well. However, it was far too hard to elevate a Celestial Tool into a Heavenly Venerate Tool. This was like the gulf between Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings and Heavenly Venerates—as wide as heaven and earth.

It was hard to say how much more Divine Metal he would need.

Gu Heyi’s wealth was astonishing. After all, he was a supreme monarch star and a big shot of the martial academy. He had more so been a Celestial King for heaven knows how many years. Thus, even Ling Han was given a small surprise.

However, it was a shame that there were no treasures to increase his cultivation.

This was very normal. If such treasures had existed, they would have already been used by Gu Heyi and helped him reach the Eighth Heaven. In that case, Ling Han might not have been able to kill him with a single slash.

Ling Han used these resources to elevate his physique. Practicing the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll required such weird and wonderful trinkets.

Right now, Ling Han’s physique had already advanced another step, reaching the Seventh Heaven. Compared to his battle prowess, however, it was greatly inferior.

“Xiao Yingxiong and Miao Hua are likely very wealthy as well. If I can obtain their wealth, perhaps my Indestructible Celestial King Physique can near a consummate level.”

Ling Han and the Empress set off again. Their Five Elements Lightning Technique was still two elements short.

Right now, they could genuinely run around without a fear in the world. Ling Han already possessed a Ninth-Heaven battle prowess, while the Empress could also reach the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven in terms of strength with the help of her Celestial Tool. Each of them was powerful enough to hold their own.

Even so, the hunt for their heads didn’t cease. The people here detested outsiders who came to train far too much. However, it was a shame that they were merely seeking death and handing their wealth over on a platter.

Ling Han felt it a pity, however, that these people were far too poor. Killing them didn’t reap many benefits.

Their travels continued for seven years, and during this time, a countless number of Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings had died at their hands. Moreover, Ling Han hadn’t needed to deal with them at all. Indeed, the Empress was powerful enough to dispose of them by herself. This also caused them to appear increasingly dangerous to the others. During the past two years, no more Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings had charged over to kill them.

Strangely enough, however, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings hadn’t appeared, either.

Ling Han remembered that he had killed many second-generation young masters, so why had these Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings still not shown themselves?

Perhaps some supreme treasure had appeared in this realm? Perhaps these elites were locked in an intense battle and unable to leave?

Several days later, a mountain appeared before the couple.

This was a dazzling golden mountain. Looking closely, however, it was clear that many swords had been stabbed into the mountain, making it look like it was filled with spikes. Between these swords, arcs of golden lightning crackled. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Lightning of Metal!” Ling Han and the Empress exclaimed as they exchanged a glance. Their faces were filled with delight.

This was the fourth land of inheritance!

They continued forward, arriving at the foot of the mountain.

Weng!

The mountain face shuddered slightly before seven swords automatically flew up and turned toward them.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The seven swords slashed at Ling Han and the Empress in unison.

These weren’t ordinary attacks, and the swords had instead formed a formation. Thus, even though there were only seven swords, their might was as if they were an army of tens and thousands.

The Empress stepped forward to battle against the seven swords.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

After a while, the Empress successfully suppressed the seven swords. However, she had a short temper, so she directly shattered them.

Daring to attack her was a sign of great disrespect. Thus, they naturally deserved to be shattered.

The two of them continued to climb the mountain. After taking a few steps, another nine swords flew up and started to attack them.

Here, battling was the main theme. They would trigger the swords each time they advanced a few steps, and the number of swords that attacked them would also increase every time. The formations the blades created would also become increasingly complex, thereby raising their might as well.

Fortunately, both Ling Han and the Empress were incredibly powerful people. Thus, they were unafraid regardless of how many swords attacked them.

There was no one else on the mountain.

However, this made sense. If one hadn’t received the inheritances of the three previous areas, why would they waste their time here? Battling against these swords would reap no benefit at all.

“Wife, have you realized? If we want to obtain the inheritance of this place, the key might lie in the formations formed by the swords,” Ling Han said.

The Empress nodded in agreement. The sword formations were ever-changing, so perhaps understanding them would allow them to comprehend the secret of this mountain. They could then find the formation eye and trigger its magnificent power. At that time, they could not only obtain another inheritance, but perhaps even elevate their cultivation.

With this in mind, the Empress stopped destroying the swords after defeating them.

The two of them started to wander around the mountain, battling against the different sword formations, and obtaining all kinds of enlightenment.

After half a year, they exchanged a glance and smiled in unison.

They had already grasped the secret of this mountain.

“Let’s go!”

They climbed the mountain again. This time, however, they took a different path from before. Strangely, no more swords flew up to form a formation and attack them.

In just half a day, they reached the peak of the mountain.

It wasn’t that they hadn’t reached the mountain peak before, it was just that they were greeted by a completely different scene this time.

This was the mystery and wonder of formations.

However, there was a person sitting cross-legged in the center of the mountain peak, surrounded by countless small golden swords. Looking closely, these swords weren’t corporeal, but instead were formed with energy.

Ling Han frowned upon seeing this. “Xiao Yingxiong!”
