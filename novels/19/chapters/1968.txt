Chapter 1969: Poisonous Fruit

Ling Han could only chuckle bitterly. Couldn’t Hu Niu think about more normal matters?

He stood up, and as he gazed at the sleeping toad, he replayed the previous scene in his mind.

‘I need to attack earlier,’ he said to himself inwardly. ‘Let’s go again.’

He charged forward again.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, he was sent hurtling back again, just like before. This time, however, he directly crashed into a mountain wall, causing even the ground to shudder.

‘I attacked too early, so my sword was lacking in power. Again.’

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Ling Han charged forward seven times in a row. However, his attack was always either too late or too early. This greatly decreased its might, rendering it unable to penetrate the toad’s defenses. In turn, he was unable to poison the toad.

The other prodigies were all humored yet astonished by this.

Was he here to fight the monster or be an*lled by the monster? How many times was this? Yet, Ling Han still insisted on charging forward. Moreover, everyone was well aware of the toad’s power. Even Shu Yarong didn’t dare to face it head-on. Yet, Ling Han was still unscathed after facing it seven times in a row! Just how terrifying was this?

‘This person... is also a freak!’

There was a glimmer in Shu Yarong’s eyes, and she thought to herself, ‘He definitely isn’t a Celestial King who’s toying with reincarnation. However, if he isn’t a Celestial King, how can he be so powerful? Perhaps he’s also a supreme freak? One who can even suppress the reincarnation of Celestial Kings?

‘Is he... the second Yi?’

Ling Han shook his head. The toad was far too quick, and its attacks were far too speedy. It was almost impossible to seize that fleeting instant to attack. If he wanted to strike this monster, he would need to make at least several hundred attempts.

However, he could only channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll a limited number of times. He could only channel it a maximum of three more times.

He needed to succeed soon.

‘I have to use the Regulation of Time,’ Ling Han thought to himself. Moreover, he also had to draw on the power of the Black Tower. Otherwise, with his fifth severance cultivation, his power of Regulations could rival those at the yang soul. It was extremely unlikely that he could wound those at the heaven soul.

Although this would exhaust his power, his defenses wouldn’t be weakened as a result. As such, he didn’t need to worry about others seizing the opportunity to attack him. In any case, both Hu Niu and the Empress were powerful enough to guarantee their safety.

As for Bewitching Maiden Rou’s battle prowess, Ling Han completely ignored it.

“...” Bewitching Maiden Rou.

‘I can give it a try. Moreover, I have to succeed!’

Ling Han strode forward before charging at the stone tablet again.

‘He’s charging forward to get an*lled again!’

Everyone was already accustomed to this scene, so they all made this remark in their mind. However, they couldn’t help but admire Ling Han’s courage.

“Croak!” The toad was emotionless, and it didn’t lose interest because Ling Han had attacked it too many times. It didn’t become angry, either. Instead, it charged forward to attack him just like before.

Crack!

It’s tongue lashed out, same as always.

Ling Han drew on the power of the Black Tower before as he unleashed a palm strike.

Weng!

The toad suddenly stopped in its tracks. It hovered in the air in an uncanny manner, yet it quickly regained its ability to move in the very next instant. It continued to dash at Ling Han.

Those at the heaven soul were far too powerful, and the Regulation of Time could only freeze them for less than one-hundredth of a heartbeat.

However, this was already enough time.

Ling Han leaned slightly to the side, preventing the toad’s attack from striking him head-on. However, because the toad had been frozen for too little time, its tongue still lashed into his body, sending him flying again.

It was also at this moment that Ling Han thrust forward with his hand, releasing the Divine Demon Sword. Like a whip, the Divine Demon Sword flew toward the toad.

This sword was imbued with Ling Han’s full power.

Pa!

Ling Han was sent flying, and the Divine Demon Sword that carried all of his hopes finally pierced into the toad’s body. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

‘Success!’

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this. This was far too astounding. Ling Han was only at the fifth severance, which meant that he was essentially a yang soul cultivator facing a heaven soul monster. Yet, he had actually managed to wound the toad. This was simply unfathomable.

‘You’re definitely a f*cking freak!’

However, many people immediately shook their heads. What did this matter?

Even if a heaven soul cultivator suffered the full-power attack of a yang soul cultivator, that would only be but a scratch. To exchange wounds like this... The yang soul cultivator would be severely wounded, while the heaven soul cultivator would only suffer some minor wounds.

After all, only their skin would be scratched, so what great effect could this have?

Pa!

Ling Han plopped down onto the ground. However, he couldn’t help but smile. As long as the Divine Demon Sword pierced the toad’s skin, it would definitely die!

After all, the juice from the poison fruit could even kill Immortal Palace Tier elites!

The Empress and Hu Niu both walked over to help Ling Han up. As for the Divine Demon Sword, they didn’t have time to deal with it at the moment.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Under the watchful gazes of everyone, the toad suddenly started to violently jump around. It was as if it had been put under some kind of curse. It wasn’t long before the toad collapsed to the ground, with its spikes powerlessly falling to the ground. A crimson-red stone appeared before everyone.

‘F*ck! It’s dead?’

Everyone was transfixed with shock and disbelief. This was far too unfathomable.

Ling Han had simply tossed his sword, so unless it was a genuine and awakened Celestial Tool, how could it have killed a heaven soul monster?

This was inconceivable. Simply inconceivable.

In the next instant, a dozen or so people immediately dashed toward the Divine Demon Sword.

Regardless of whether it was a Celestial Tool or not, they would snatch it and run away first.

“Wowee, such despicable people!” Hu Niu roared in anger. She immediately charged forward, shouting, “You people are far too detestable! So be it if you don’t thank Ling Han for killing the toad, yet you’re even trying to steal his weapon! Niu is going to pummel you people to death!”

Peng, peng, peng!

She immediately started to battle against those people.

Emperor tiers were no match for her, yet three monarch tiers had also charged forward to steal Ling Han’s weapon. One of them was none other than Fei Yun. Thus, Hu Niu couldn’t dispose of them easily, especially Fei Yun. Instead, they became engaged in an intense battle.

Meanwhile, Ling Han started to rapidly recover his energy. He wasn’t in a state to battle right now, so the Empress stood guard beside him.

“Haha, since the monster has already been disposed of, the alliance should also be disbanded!” a monarch tier from the Wide Prosperity Heaven said with a loud laugh. His expression became cold, and he said, “Trash from the Calm Peace Heaven, are you not going to f*ck off now?”

Ling Han’s state was clear for all to see. He had already lost the ability to battle. Thus, the only person of concern from the Calm Peace Heaven was Hu Niu.

Would this not be easy to deal with?

A treasure like the true meaning of the great dao could create a paramount prodigy. Moreover, the Wide Prosperity Heaven and the Calm Peace Heaven were locked in a fierce competition, so those from the Wide Prosperity Heaven naturally didn’t want those from the Calm Peace Heaven to comprehend the true meaning of the great dao.

“Shameless!” Yan Xianlu and the others chided.

It was Ling Han who had killed the guardian monster, yet these people were not only taking credit for this, but they were even trying to shoo him away and steal his weapon. This was far too repulsive.

“If you don’t piss off, then don’t blame me for being merciless!” a monarch tier from the Wide Prosperity Heaven said in a baleful voice. He was called Ye Linfeng, and he was ranked number five in the Wide Prosperity Heaven. He was definitely a top-notch prodigy.

“Fight to the death with them!” many people from the Calm Peace Heaven shouted in anger.

First of all, they were truly infuriated. Second of all, the true meaning of the great dao was far too enticing. Who was willing to abandon this opportunity?

“Hahahaha!” Fei Yun roared with laughter as a sword appeared in his hand.

He had successfully snatched the Divine Demon Sword.
