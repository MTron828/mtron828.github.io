Ling Han glanced at him. “Where are your lackeys? Let them come out.”

“Ling Han!” someone shouted immediately, and walked out from the surging yellow sand.

It was the Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate.

He was just a member of the Yue Clan’s alliance, an alliance and not anyone’s subordinate. He was a dignified Heavenly Venerate, and a Fourth Tier cultivator at that. How could he possibly be under someone else’s command? The reason why he would take action under Yue Chengwang’s instigation was naturally the treasures in Ling Han’s possession.

!!

…That broken saber, the peerless Great Herbs, and the Heavenly Venerable Seals were all too attractive.

“Out of the mouth comes misfortune. This is an old saying, and it contains the truth, but there are people who haven’t suffered enough.” The Four Sides Heavenly Venerate also came out of the yellow sand, and his face was now filled with bitterness and sorrow.

“There is nothing left to be said, kill him!” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate also appeared, and stood behind Ling Han to prevent him from escaping.

When he went to see Ling Han that day, his face was full of amiability, which made people feel that he was very easy to get along with, but now his face was filled with killing intent, which made people shudder.

The Six Heavens Heavenly Venerate and Gray Space Heavenly Venerate also appeared on the left and right, respectively, similarly full of killing intent.

In this instant, five Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates had actually joined forces to surround and attack Ling Han.

Ling Han remained unfazed, turned his head, and said, “All of you, go into hiding first. I’ll get rid of the trash first.”

The Empress and the others nodded, and entered the Celestial Guest Residence one after another.

“Such an arrogant tone!” said the Four Sides Heavenly Venerate, his face filled with anger, and it was obvious that he had switched “expressions.”

“No matter how freakish you are, you’re merely a Second Tier,” the Highest North Heavenly Venerate said disdainfully.

“Milords, please act together to suppress this brat,” Yue Chengwang urged. Although he was the son of a Sixth Tier, he had to maintain absolute respect when facing Fourth Tiers. At the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier, the hierarchy of the levels became even stricter.

“Alright, we can avoid future troubles.” The Gray Space Heavenly Venerate nodded, and took the initiative to attack.

As he made the move, the other Heavenly Venerates moved as well. The five great elites launched attacks together towards Ling Han to suppress him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Boom! The attacks of the Fourth Tiers were too terrifying. The space here was already unstable, and the earth immediately crumbled, creating an extremely frightening scene, as if the entire dimension was about to collapse.

If these attacks took place in the Flaming Frost Realm, it would be absolutely impossible to cause such an effect, as the power of the heaven and earth would balance and suppress it in order to maintain the stability of the dimension.

However, this dimension was already “dead.” Rather than calling it a dimension, it would be more accurate to describe it as a huge piece of barren land that couldn’t breed any vitality, because this dimension itself was dead and absolutely devoid of vitality to begin with.

The destructive power of a Heavenly Venerate could be infinitely magnified here, and the horror of it was indescribable.

Ling Han humphed coldly. “You’re seeking death!”

His body moved, and appeared in front of the Highest North Heavenly Venerate, throwing out a punch.

“You’re overestimating your abilities!” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate sneered, maintaining his original attack.

Peng!

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was immediately sent flying. He was actually no match for Ling Han at all.

Ling Han charged forward through this gap, and chased after the Highest North Heavenly Venerate, barraging him violently.

Peng, peng, peng! His punches became faster and faster. The infinite Power of Dimension burst forth from within his body, and densely packed seals flickered on his skull, interweaving together into one piece. As he struck with the Fists of Fury, he unleashed his full battle prowess.

This time, Ling Han was channeling the ninth-grade combination seals, which boosted his power by 44 times, causing his battle prowess to be extremely terrifying.

“Not good!” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate couldn’t help being shocked. Although Ling Han was only channeling ninth-grade seals, which he himself had mastered a few of, the boost in power the latter enjoyed was only four or five times, but the effect was completely different when it was channeled in Ling Han’s hands.

“Combination seals!” the Highest North exclaimed. Dozens of ninth-grade seals were superimposed together, and their effect would reach the level of fifth grade, surpassing any high-level seals that he had mastered.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate tried his best to block the attacks, but he was no match for Ling Han’s power at all. He was being knocked back again and again.

The Highest North retreated, but Ling Han chased him down and kept attacking, while the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the other great elites were several positions behind, and were actually unable to catch up no matter what.

This was too appalling. It was clearly the five great elites that had besieged Ling Han alone, but now the situation was forcibly turned into a one-on-one battle.

And the result of a one-on-one battle was that the Highest North Heavenly Venerate was outmatched!

The Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the other three were both anxious and shocked. If Ling Han was to finish off the Highest North Heavenly Venerate first, that would be equivalent to breaking one of their links, and it also meant that Ling Han could still crush them one by one.

Therefore, they had to stop Ling Han. Otherwise, it would deal a devastating blow to their confidence.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate naturally knew this too, and he was being drawn into the eye of the storm, which left him no room for retreat, so he could only grit his teeth and persevere.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

However, Ling Han’s explosive power was too terrifying. Ling Han’s strength wasn’t inferior to the Highest North’s to begin with, and now with a strength boost of 44 times, in addition to the power of the Heavenly Venerate Technique that he had cultivated, the power of his strikes really caused his opponent to complain unceasingly.

How could a mere Second Tier be strong to this extent?

Blood flowed from the corner of the Highest North’s mouth, but he forcibly suppressed it, and didn’t spit it out directly from his throat.

Further, his complexion was even more hilarious. It was red at one instance, and then white in the next instance, being even more changeable than that of the Four Sides Heavenly Venerate.

Crack! Crack! Crack! The violent sound of bones breaking could be heard continuously. Despite the Highest North Heavenly Venerate’s body being tempered by the fundamental power, under such a fierce attack, there was still breakage.

He hastily took out a cyan Great Herb, and just bit off a leaf and consumed it without even looking at it.

In the midst of a fierce battle, there was no time for the Highest North Heavenly Venerate to recover slowly, and he could only consume a precious leaf of a Great Herb.

The effect was obvious. His Heavenly Venerate bones were healing, and even showing signs of becoming stronger within a short period of time.

This was just the healing of a cyan Great Herb. If it had been green or yellow, it would definitely have been even more impressive and awesome.

“How dare you eat my precious medicine, spit it out!” Ling Han was furious, and he struck with Fists of Fury even more rapidly.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was taken aback for a moment. ‘What has my consumption of my own Great Herb anything to do with you?’ However, he suddenly realized that Ling Han already regarded him as a dead person, so everything on him naturally became Ling Han’s.

Thinking that way, wasn’t he just consuming Ling Han’s Great Herb?

Damn, Ling Han was too hateful!

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate screamed. Ever since he had become a Heavenly Venerate, he had never lost his composure like this, but now he was being infuriated to the extreme by Ling Han.

And yet he could only keep retreating despite being furious.

...

Oh, how much he wanted to reunite with the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the others so they could combine the power of five people to suppress Ling Han.

However, Ling Han didn’t give the Highest North this chance at all, simply targeting him and fiercely beating him up, so much so that he could only be continuously sent flying. While the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the others were not far away, the distance remained fixed, and they were unable to get any closer.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate also became ruthless. If worse came to worst, he would just consume all of this Great Herb, and he didn’t believe that he wouldn’t be able to survive Ling Han’s burst of power.

…The Heavenly Venerable Seals could only release energy for a maximum of two hours, regardless of whether it was a single seal or combination seals.

At that time… to say nothing of the joint forces of the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the others, even the Highest North Heavenly Venerate himself wouldn’t need to be afraid of Ling Han.

It was just that Ling Han’s punches were too overbearing. After a while, the Highest North Heavenly Venerate had to bite off another leaf and consume it. The bones in his arm had already been severely broken, so he had no choice but to take the medicine.

Ling Han burst into anger, while his fists struck with greater and greater speed.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate could only keep on taking medicine as he had to survive this most dangerous period.
