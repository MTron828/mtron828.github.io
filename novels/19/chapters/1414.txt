Chapter 1415 Forcing Me to Unleash My Trump Card

The Eternity Sky Emperor was infuriated. From birth until now, since when had anyone dared to scold him like this?

“You’re seeking death!” He forcefully suppressed his rage.

Boom!

He then unleashed his aura, which transformed into a column of divine flames that soared into the sky. This column of flames birthed all kinds of fire-element Divine Beasts—fire dragons, fire phoenixes, fire kirins... All of these beasts reared their heads as they roared aloud.

“Come!” Ling Han said as he hooked his finger provocatively. “Want to make a bet? I’ll be able to suppress you within 1000 years! Or perhaps you want to wait until my wife comes out of seclusion? I’m sure she can also smack you to death with ease.”

“Toxic brat!” The Eternity Sky Emperor unleashed an attack.

This attack was completely different from the elder’s attacks. Not only was the Eternity Sky Emperor at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, but he was also a four-star genius. Moreover, he was the ruler of a Majestic Empire, meaning that he could draw on the power of the nation unrestrainedly. Of course, this was as long as there was still the power of the nation to draw on, and as long as his body could withstand the power.

On top of being a four-star genius, his battle prowess elevated by another two stars!

How could Ling Han block this attack?

Even though Ling Han activated Tide of the Ages, he was still sent flying by the Eternity Sky Emperor’s strike. However, he forcefully stopped his momentum the instant that he struck the stone door. A cloud of blood exploded from his body, which had already become mangled and bloody.

“You want to steal my wife with such measly power? Have you wasted your tens of millions of years of cultivation on a dog?” Even though he was severely wounded, Ling Han still rattled off a string of insults.

The Eternity Sky Emperor was astonished at the same time that he was enraged. Ling Han was only at the early stage of the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier! If he were given some time and advanced to the consummate level—no, just the high extreme—could anyone at the Heavenly Body Tier still manage to kill him?

This person... definitely had to die!

“Haha, this emperor will also join the fun!” Following a hearty laugh, the Jade Drop Emperor also hovered over, throwing a punch as he did so. A water dragon instantly materialized in the air, surging toward Ling Han like a wave.

Swoosh!

There was the sound of crashing waves; this was a mighty and astonishing sound.

The two emperors were actually ganging up against a junior?

This was completely and utterly shameless!

However, who dared to say anything? At their supreme cultivation level, would they still care about the opinions of others? To say nothing of ganging up against an elite at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, what would it matter even if they ganged up against and killed a cultivator at the Mountain River Tier?

Of course, this entire situation was just a joke. However, this was a joke that no one dared to laugh at.

So, how was Ling Han going to block this attack?

Ling Han waved his hand and retrieved a large handful of Flying Fire Pill, saying, “Old hooligans, see how I blow you two up!”

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

He started to throw the Flying Fire Pills.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Deafening explosions ripped through the garden as everyone was thrown off their feet. This was already beyond the attack of an elite at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. The stacked power of the several hundred Flying Fire Pills meant that their destructive power had also risen explosively.

Ling Han activated Tide of the Ages again, finally managing to dissipate the power of the two majestic emperor’s attacks.

Following this blistering exchange, everyone’s mouth was hanging wide open in shock. So what if they were at the Heavenly Body Tier? They were still shocked speechless at this moment.

The two emperors had teamed up, yet they were still unable to suppress Ling Han. In fact, their attacks had been completely blocked!

It didn’t matter that Ling Han had borrowed external power. On Joint Peace Planet, the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor were the embodiment of invincibility. Right now, however, they were unable to suppress Ling Han even though they had teamed up. This battle was enough to spread Ling Han’s name throughout the world.

It was a shame that... he was destined to die here. Today’s battle was his swansong.

“Humph, how many more of these weapons do you have?” the Jade Drop Emperor asked with a cold sneer.

“Enough to blow you up!” Ling Han waved his hand, and another large handful of Flying Fire Pills materialized in his palm.

‘F*ck!’

Even the two emperors couldn’t help but curse in their minds at this moment. ‘How can this brat possess so many of these devastating weapons? Did he f*cking plunder the treasure storage of an Eternal River Tier elite?’

They naturally weren’t aware that Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor. Moreover, he had also moved an entire forest of Explosion Fruit Trees into the Black Tower. Thus, he had an astonishing number of Flying Fire Pills in his possession.

“Everyone, attack! We must exhaust him of all his trump cards!” The Eternity Sky Emperor waved his hand, and the Heavenly Body Tier elites who were still capable of battle all stepped forward.

The Jade Drop Emperor also issued an identical command. Right now, their most important task was to kill Ling Han. After killing him, they could then open the stone door and capture Empress Luan Xing.

Among those who stepped forward, there were nine elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier and 19 elites at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. As for those at the medium extreme, they didn’t need to participate in this battle. In any case, there were already enough elites to deal with Ling Han. Moreover, those at the medium extreme didn’t even possess the ability to wound him.

Ling Han took a deep breath. With so many elites ganging up on him, even the Flying Fire Pills wouldn’t be of much use.

“Are you people forcing me to unleash my ultimate trump card?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“Die!”

The elites of the two Majestic Empires charged forward. With so many of them together, they naturally weren’t afraid of Ling Han.

“Heh, don’t cry for mommy!” Ling Han waved his right hand, tossing a figure into the air.

“F*ck you! F*ck you!” This was naturally the Notionless Saint. Moreover, he was understandably enraged at this moment. He was on the cusp of breaking through to the Sun Moon Tier, yet he had suddenly been dragged out of the Black Tower again. Thus, he couldn’t help but shout a string of curses.

Yet, when he calmed down and surveyed the surroundings, he couldn’t help but grimace.

‘Holy f*ck! Brat, are you a star of misfortune? How do you attract trouble wherever you go?!’ L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If he still possessed the same power as his previous life, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid of the several dozen Heavenly Body Tier elites before him. Yet, he was only a shell of his past self now! However, he had already been pushed to the fore, so he could only grit his teeth and act the part.

“You people are seeking death!” he said with a cold humph.

Boom!

His Genesis Tier aura burst into the surroundings, and it was as if a Saint had descended.

‘What?!’

The Heavenly Body Tier elites hurriedly stopped in their tracks, stunned expressions on their faces. This aura... was far too powerful! It was so powerful that it transcended the level of their existence. It was as if they would possess no ability to resist if this person desired to target them.

Eternal River Tier, this was definitely an Eternal River Tier elite!

Terror instantly spread through their minds. The elites were completely oblivious to the fact that the Notionless Saint was only a hollow shell.

“Our respects to you, Senior!” Including the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor, everyone bowed and greeted the Notioness Saint with respect. There was no doubt about his aura. His cultivation was definitely transcendent above the Heavenly Body Tier.

The Notionless Saint’s expression remained unchanging, and he calmly said, “I have a deep relationship with this young man. Why are you people troubling him?”

Everyone came to a sudden realization. No wonder Ling Han’s cultivation speed was so incredible. It was because he had the guidance of an Eternal River Tier elite! With such guidance, it would be strange if his cultivation speed wasn’t incredible. They were all extremely envious. How good would it be if they could also receive guidance from an Eternal River Tier elite?

Anyhow, with such an elite behind Ling Han, were they going to abandon their plans just like this?

The Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor both frowned at the same time. They had indeed been frightened by the aura of the Notionless Saint just then. However, they quickly noticed some peculiarities.

The Notionless Saint’s aura felt a little brittle, and it was as if he were only strong in appearance. His aura was far less terrifying than they had initially imagined.

There were suspicions in their mind, yet they didn’t dare to act impulsively.

If their suspicions were wrong, and the Eternal River Tier elite unleashed his might, what would it matter that they were both emperors of a Majestic Empire? They still wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of death.

“Please forgive us, Senior,” the Eternity Sky Emperor said. He appeared respectful, yet he was actually observing the Notionless Saint closely.

They had already pushed Ling Han so far, yet the Notionless Saint still hadn’t lashed out and killed all of them. Instead, it was as if he wanted to resolve this conflict peacefully. Was this not worthy of suspicion?

Since when were elites this good-tempered?

How experienced was the Notionless Saint? He could naturally sense the suspicion from the Eternity Sky Emperor and the others. He immediately humphed and unleashed his aura, causing a mountain of pressure to instantly descend on the elites of the two Majestic Empires.
