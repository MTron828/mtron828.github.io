Chapter 1878: Holy Son Ou Kan

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “How can I help you, Holy Son Ou?”

Ou Kan had already descended the stairs with a few steps, and walked to Ling Han’s side. He bared his mouth in a grin, two rows of teeth white and neat, as he said, “You are truly a busy person. It really is difficult to even meet you.”

Ling Han only chuckled in response. This Ou Kan put on a pretense as if they were old friends, but he was not even familiar with him. To say nothing of being familiar with him, he was not familiar with Lu Xianming, even. It was just that the latter was very cordial, and added with the fact that Ling Han had also saved him before, he had thus accepted his invitation.

His divine sense was sensitive, and discovered that there were at least four individual divine senses locked on him. But they were only at the Severing Mundane Tier’s level, so he naturally was completely fearless.

They should belong to Ou Kan’s guards. He himself was only in the Severing Mundane Tier.

An alchemist did not need to have a high cultivation level, because the requirement for concocting Celestial pills was only the Severing Mundane Tier. If they could advance into this level, then they would be able to concoct even *** Celestial pills. But in truth, because their divine sense was not strong enough, it was practically an impossible feat for a Severing Mundane Tier to concoct a **** Celestial pill.

At least, a miracle like that had yet to happen. Ordinarily, a Severing Mundane Tier could concoct Two-Star Celestial pills at most, while Dividing Soul Tier could concoct Three-Star pills, only a level higher than themselves.

And also because of that, when Alchemy City chose its heirs, there was no need for cultivation level to become the largest factor of consideration. It was fine as long as they could advance into the Severing Mundane Tier.

...With oceans of alchemical pills bombarding them without any care for the expense, advancing to the Ascending Origin Tier was no mere dream. Of course, being capable of becoming high-grade alchemists, how could they themselves possibly be any idiots?

Thus, the chairperson of Alchemy City ordinarily would possess the cultivation level of the Ascending Origin Tier, but this battle prowess was possibly the weakest in the Ascending Origin Tier. Even if they reached consummate level, they would only possess the standard of great accomplishment.

Whatever the case, because Ou Kan’s cultivation level was not high, and furthermore, they were in Alchemy City, the only people he could mobilize would only be at the Severing Mundane Tier.

“Ling Han, are you interested in working for me?” Ou Kan saw Ling Han was expressionless, and did not beat around the bush, getting straight to the point.

Ling Han shook his head, and very crisply answered, “No.”

Ou Kan’s expression looked a little ugly after having been rebuffed like this. For a Holy Son like himself, whose status was noble, it was really very difficult to hear others say “no” to him. Thankfully, his composure control was not too bad, and he immediately suppressed this kind of displeasure.

“Aren’t you going to hear the conditions I offer?” He forced out a sliver of a smile.

“No need.” Ling Han shook his head.

The other party had probably misunderstood. Ling Han had no intention of working for Lu Xianming at all, and now he was only a guest at the Lu Clan.

But true, this was Alchemy City where alchemists were revered and respected. Cultivators had their martial arts, and weren’t they all wanting to sell themselves to high-grade alchemists, and would thus have no worries of getting a few alchemical pills for their efforts?

After advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier, the rate of cultivation would slow down to a snail’s pace if a cultivator could not be supported with Celestial medicines. They could only advance further by depending on Celestial medicines. After advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, cultivation was actually a contest with time. Otherwise, a few more Immortal’s Tribulations, and they really would be killed if their own strength had not increased.

Hence why alchemists had such outstanding status. From a certain aspect, they had grasp over the life of a cultivator.

Ou Kan had been rebuffed twice in a row, and his displeasure finally seeped into his expression, and he said, “Ling Han, don’t forget yourself! No matter how much of a prodigy you are, you are merely a Severing Mundane Tier, and are not yet qualified to ask for sky-high prices.”

Ling Han sighed. Why had he encountered yet another idiot?

What did he do?

‘Refusing your offer of recruitment means that I am looking down on you, and have forgotten myself in my conceit? F***, has he proposed a price? Asking for sky-high prices your sister!’

How could there be such a person who went off talking on his own?

Ling Han’s expression also turned cold, and he said, “Step aside, and don’t waste my time.”

“Ling Han!” Ou Kan’s voice rose a few pitches higher. “I know, you are merely waiting for a good offer! I might as well tell you, though Lu Xianming’s present situation is indeed superior, us other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters are not people to be trifled with, either!

“There are nine Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of Alchemy City, and aside from a few useless pieces of trash, I—Ou Kan—Jiao Bang, and Qin Guyu are all qualified to contest with Lu Xianming. Furthermore... we have already decided to join forces and kick him out of the contest first.

“You are clinging to a tree that is destined to wilt, isn’t that too stupid?”

This was an idiot. ‘Which ear have you heard with, and which eye have you seen with that I am going to mix around with Lu Xianming? You can’t be that self-opinionated.’

Ling Han shook his head. He was really worried about the IQ of this person. And he wanted to contest for the position of chairperson like this?

Oh, right. Ling Han’s own aim was also to become the chairperson of Alchemy City, or at least an heir. Firstly, he could make his name known so he could reach Commander Guan, and secondly, he was fond of alchemy in the first place, and was of a mind to develop himself here.

Going by that logic, whether it was this Ou Kan or Lu Xianming, they were actually all his competitors.

Ling Han scratched his head. Previously, he had not taken this problem into consideration. As the Alchemy Emperor, he was too confident in himself in the area of alchemy. With all others being mediocre, there really were none that he took seriously.

Thus, he had never taken Lu Xianming and the other nine Holy Sons and Holy Daughters to heart and considered them his rivals. It was just like when the lion king ascended the throne: would he have to be concerned about a few lambs that he had passed on his way?

Ling Han broke into a grin. Since Ou Kan was also a competitor, then there was no harm in playing around with him, and striking a blow to his pride.

“Then what do you suggest?” he asked.

Ou Kan instantly bore an expression of pride. See, see, he only had to reveal his trump card slightly, and this brat had cowered as expected.

Just playing up to those in power!

This was also his twisted logic. If you did not listen to me, then you had forgotten yourself in your conceit. If you listened, you were merely playing up to those in power. In any case, it was still he who was in a lofty position, and everything was up to him to decide.

“I will give you two choices. The first is an inferior plan, and that is to leave Lu Xianming, and get out of Alchemy City! The second is a superior option, and that is to come under my banner, and I will take you to the pinnacle of your life!”

Ling Han almost spluttered in laughter. ‘Why don’t you just go ahead and say that you will allow me to show off and fly?’

He shook his head, and said, “I choose the third option.”

What third option? There was no third option!

Ou Kan’s expression cooled, and he said, “Oh, you want to add on a condition? Fine then, go ahead and say it.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’ll be the boss, and you Holy Sons and Holy Daughters should all come and bow down to me!”

By the look of things now, this was a joke, but only Ling Han was filled with confidence. In future, he was to become the king of Alchemy City. Then, whether it was Ou Kan, Lu Xianming, or the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, they would all have to bow down to him as their master.

“Hahahaha!” Ou Kan laughed quickly in derision. This time, he had really been angered. A mere Severing Mundane Tier... So what if you were even more of a prodigy?

This was Alchemy City!

Ling Han ascended the steps, and said, “Step aside!”

At first, Ou Kan wanted to make a move, but thinking of Ling Han’s terrifying strength, the hand that he had raised slightly immediately lowered. If he did make a move, he would only be asking for his own humiliation. Furthermore, he would be shamed if he, a noble Holy Son, was to be beaten.

He humphed, and followed Ling Han with a wave of his sleeve. “Ling Han, then I’ll just let you see what kind of power the Holy Son of Alchemy City has! You want to buy alchemical pills? Hehe, without my agreement, just see who would dare sell anything to you!”

He deserved to be a Holy Son even with such narrow-mindedness?

Ling Han shook his head internally. In comparison, Lu Xianming was indeed considerably stronger. It was no wonder he was the most popular. However, his intention was not to buy alchemical pills in the first place. ‘If you continue to think so highly of yourself, aren’t you afraid that you would fly into rage out of humiliation later?’

Speaking of rage out of humiliation, Ling Han involuntarily smiled. Then, he’d just play around with this guy.
