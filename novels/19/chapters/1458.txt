Chapter 1459 Great Opportunity

‘What great opportunity am I going to receive?’

Ling Han was also eager to know.

The golden boulder continued to glow, and Ling Han discovered that the boulder beneath his feet was actually melting. It was as if it were becoming water. Meanwhile, it was as if he were about to sink into this water. During this process, Ling Han had even considered escaping into the Black Tower. After all, this was an unpredictable event.

Although the Sunken Abyss Valley was renowned as a place to obtain great opportunities, Ling Han was still afraid of the “what if”.

Ling Han had entered many ancient sites before, and which time hadn’t he come across some rare opportunity? However, these opportunities had all come with a serving of disaster.

Take, for example, the Devil Sky Mystery Realm, where the Asura Demon Emperor had escaped from. There was also the Heavenly Sea Mystery Realm, where he had come across Demon Master Zhen Yi. Then there was the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm, where he had almost been screwed over by the Notionless Saint. Indeed, Ling Han had a habit of coming across rare opportunities that were accompanied by dangers that could screw him over.

Thus, he didn’t dare to let his guard down at this moment. No one had ever ascended this peak before, so it was in his best interests to remain alert and wary.

Fortunately, he was simply sinking into the melting rock. No other danger swooped down at him.

Eventually, his entire body was enveloped by the rock. It was also at this moment that he appeared in a strange place.

This place was dotted with stars, though these stars were definitely not real. They seemed to be close enough to touch, yet they also seemed to be far away on the horizon at the same time. Meanwhile, he was treading through the void, though it felt as if he were walking on solid ground. He didn’t feel any emptiness and weightlessness.

Surprisingly, there was actually an independent space inside the gigantic golden boulder!

Ling Han continued to advance, yet his surroundings didn’t change no matter how far he walked. He was still surrounded by the void and a plethora of stars.

‘Where’s my great opportunity?’

“Oi!” Ling Han shouted. “Is there anyone here?”

After shouting this, even he wanted to laugh at his own stupidity.

“Yes.” At this moment, however, someone actually responded to his question.

Ling Han’s heart jolted, and he solemnly asked, “Who’s there?”

“Someone who’s already been dead for a long, long time,” the voice replied.

‘Heh.’

Ling Han wasn’t easily convinced by this reply. In this day and age, there were far too many dead people crawling out and running all over the place. “How should I refer to you, Senior?” he asked.

“Me...?” The voice faltered for a moment before continuing, “I’m called Hu Yu. Now that I think about it, I’m a person who died tens of billions of years ago.”

“Then for what reason has Senior summoned me into this place?” Ling Han asked.

“To bestow upon you a great opportunity!” Hu Yu replied.

Ling Han was unflustered, and he calmly asked, “Dare I ask, what is this great opportunity that you speak of?”

Hu Yu replied with a question, asking, “Brat, do you know that there’s another realm transcendent above the Immortal Realm?”

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Could it be that this dead elite had also come from the Celestial Realm? This was extremely likely. After all, even the Star Sand Saint was unable to do anything about this place. Just this alone was enough to prove that the creator of this place was at least at the level of Saint King.

Once one advanced past the level of Saint King, they would reach the level of the Severing Mundane Tier. However, this was a tier that could only exist in the Celestial Realm.

“Celestial Realm?” Ling Han replied with a chuckle.

“Huh? You know about the existence of the Celestial Realm? Perhaps you’re the descendant of a tribe that was banished?” Hu Yu was astonished, and he couldn’t help but ask about Ling Han’s background.

‘Tribes that were banished? The ancient divine tribes were tribes that were banished?’

The Faceless Tribe and Nine Snake Tribe all possessed incredibly powerful bloodlines. Meanwhile, it was extremely likely that Ding Ping and Jiuyao were also the descendants of some ancient divine tribe. As for Gu Daoyi, there was no question that he was from the Celestial Realm. Truth be told, he was actually one of the ancestors of the ancient divine tribes, a first-generation elite from the Celestial Realm.

However, these powerful tribes and bloodlines had actually been banished from the Celestial Realm?

Ling Han remained silent. In fact, he only knew very little about the ancient divine tribes. Similarly, he didn’t know much about the Celestial Realm, either. As such, his best choice was naturally to remain silent. The more he spoke, the more likely it was that he would make a mistake.

Hu Yu didn’t become suspicious. He said, “Since you’re aware of the existence of the Celestial Realm, I don’t need to waste any more time explaining. I can gift you a rare treasure from the Celestial Realm as well as a secret technique from the Celestial Realm. However, in exchange, you need to help me kill someone.”

“Whom do you want me to kill?” Ling Han asked. “Why don’t you explain in more detail. I don’t have a habit of wantonly killing innocent people. Unless they deserve to die, I’d rather forfeit whatever inheritance it is that you wish to bestow upon me.”

In any case, the Black Tower was already the most powerful rare treasure of the Celestial Realm—one of the most powerful, at the very least. Thus, Ling Han wasn’t overly greedy when it came to the so-called rare treasures of the Celestial Realm. He wouldn’t abandon his principles and stoop below his own bottom line to obtain these rare treasures.

“Hahahaha!” Hu Yu laughed heartily, and said, “Very well, very well! I very much like people of principle! Since this is the case, let me tell you a story.”

He paused for a moment before starting to tell his story.

“I’m the last member of the Hu Clan.

“10 billion years ago—the specific time has already become fuzzy—great unrest swept throughout the entire Celestial Realm. Countless forces, including some of the most powerful forces, were all subject to existential catastrophes. All of them were banished from the Celestial Realm.

“Although my Hu Clan couldn’t be regarded as a first-rate force of the Celestial Realm, it was still powerful enough to be regarded as a mighty regional force. There were Severing Mundane Tier grand elders in my clan. Moreover, my clan had also obtained a rare treasure before. However, after countless years of investigation, we were still unable to determine the usage of this rare treasure.

“During the period of great unrest, the Hu Clan wisely chose to protect itself, not participating in the battles. However, one of the clans...”

Hu Yu’s voice suddenly became cold, and it was as if he were gritting his teeth in anger. “They maliciously targeted and smeared my Hu Yu’s name, claiming that we were a supporter of the great unrest. As a result, a supreme elite descended to massacre the entire Hu Clan.

“What that clan wanted was the rare treasure that my clan had obtained. They had been an intimate friend of our clan before, yet when our defenses were down, they suddenly turned around to stab us in the back!

“I was only able to escape death because I had been out adventuring and training at the time.

“After learning of this news, I immediately returned to the ancestral grounds to retrieve that rare treasure.

“Although that clan searched many times, they were completely unable to find the whereabouts of the rare treasure. However, they continued to keep an eye out, eventually discovering my existence. They then turned their attention onto me, starting to hunt me down relentlessly.

“Taking the rare treasure with me, I eventually fled from the Celestial Realm. However, I was severely wounded during this process, and I eventually succumbed to my wounds. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“However, a wisp of my damaged soul actually fused together with the rare treasure. It was only then that I finally discovered the true use of the rare treasure. It was a shame that... it was already too late.

“With the support of this rare treasure, my wisp of damaged soul was able to survive for generation after generation. I lived on for no other reason but to search for a supreme prodigy, someone who could one day enter the Celestial Realm and exact revenge for my Hu Clan!”

Hu Yu’s voice had become shrill, and it was clear that he was filled with boundless fury.

After listening to his story, it was clear that he had indeed suffered immensely.

Ling Han mulled over this for a moment before saying, “Then this Sunken Abyss Valley should actually be called the Deep Injustice Valley[1].”

“That’s indeed the case,” Hu Yu replied. “I could only channel a limited amount of power of the rare treasure and transform the environment of heaven and earth in this area. Doing so allowed me to attract generation after generation of prodigies to this place. Now, after so many years, a suitable candidate has finally appeared before me.

“I don’t ask for you to kill all of the enemies of the Hu Clan, just the leader of their betrayal. Make a vow to the Dao of Heaven and Earth that you’ll definitely complete this task. After taking this vow, I’ll give you the rare treasure and also teach you the ultimate technique of the Hu Clan.”

“If everything is as Senior has said, I’ll definitely exact revenge for the Hu Clan when I enter the Celestial Realm and become powerful enough.” Ling Han raised his hand and completed a dao oath.

The higher one’s cultivation level, the more serious taking a dao oath would become. This was because powerful elites could already rouse the Regulations of heaven and earth. In other words, it was as if they were being watched over by an eye in the heavens.

“Very well!” Hu Yu said with a hearty laugh. It was as if he could already see his mortal enemies being obliterated into ashes.
