Chapter 2360: Mysterious substance

“According to my deductions, this should be a substance that is inclined towards the spirit,” Wally said. He continued to scan that substance with green light. This was the second time.

Ling Han was surprised. “There is actually something in this world that you don’t know.”

“That is natural.” Wally was very humble. “Who knows how many realms there are in the Genesis World. I have only just ventured to a high-level dimension, and every realm has its own unique traits, though a considerable number of heaven and earth would be similar.”

Ling Han shook the palm civet in his grip. “Can this thing be eaten?”

Would they also go mad if they consumed it?

“As long as you don’t touch this thing, it will be fine,” Wally said, pointing at the gray substance.

Ling Han cracked a grin. “Then, let’s eat!”

They started a fire and roasted the meat, eating this palm civet. For better or worse, it was still at the Eighth Lotus, so its flesh was delicious. Furthermore, it contained an abundance of energy, which would be slightly beneficial for their cultivation.

Finally, Ling Han carefully removed that layer of gray substance, planning to take it into the Black Tower, yet he suddenly discovered that he could not enter into the Black Tower.

It was not like that scroll that could not be stowed in the Black Tower, but rather he himself had also been refused entry.

“This thing is extremely dangerous!” Small Tower’s voice rang out. “It would very possibly corrode my consciousness, and cause me to head towards destruction.”

‘What?!’

Only now did Ling Han get a true shock. What was the Black Tower?

A precious Tool of a Heavenly Venerate!

But Small Tower was actually wary of this gray thing as well, and was unwilling to take it in, which would be equivalent to “taking poison.” But what poison could “kill” the precious Tool of a Heavenly Venerate?

Clearly, Ling Han had underestimated how frightening this substance could be.

“What exactly is this thing? Even Wally doesn’t know, and even Small Tower is afraid of it!” Ling Han mumbled. The whole Golden Clouds Mountain should be filled with this kind of substance, but even ordinary cultivators would not be affected as long as they did not get in contact with it for a long time. Why was this the case?

“The level of quality is too high, but because there is not enough quantity, the influence has decreased?” he guessed.

Right when Ling Han was pondering, he discovered that the gray substance was actually dispersing, and soon vanished completely.

“It cannot stay for long outside of a living creature, but I can feel that it has not truly vanished, but has rather been re-assimilated into this place.” Ling Han raised his head to look at the erupting volcano.

“This… What exactly is this place?”

Whatever place this was, since they were already here, they should naturally search high and low for Chaos Source Rocks. “Search our n?wno?el.?rg”Small Tower had previously set its eye on them, so they were clearly extremely valuable.

They roamed around on the mountain, and gradually went deeper and deeper.

This was a very silent place, and even stepping on a leaf could produce a very loud sound.?Sha, sha, sha, they walked onwards, yet suddenly stopped. Only a while later, light appeared ahead of them.

This was a man of the Angel Race; it was Feng Hailuan.

Feng Hailuan clearly had not expected he would encounter Ling Han here. Killing intent flashed across his face, but he immediately hid it. Releasing a humph, he strode off.

Killing intent flashed across Ling Han’s face as well. If it were not for the fact that he knew that the divine sense of two Heavenly Venerates were here, and could sweep over at any time, he would definitely chase after and kill this guy.

After witnessing Xue Ge’s cruelty, Ling Han knew they were all the same, whether they were Demon Race, Angel Race, Holy Beasts, or Insect Race. He could not think that they were kind just because the Angel Race and Holy Beasts had not invaded the Celestial Realm.

‘There will eventually be a chance,’ Ling Han thought.

They continued walking on the mountain, and would occasionally encounter berserk wild beasts, wild men, Insect Race members, and so on. Whatever they encountered, the latter was incredibly mad, and existed only for the purpose of slaughter.

Ling Han and his group could deal with most enemies. Little Terror was also an incredibly powerful existence, and it could offer some resistance even against a Ninth Lotus Third Leaf opponent.

“Could it be that Ascending Origin Tier has no pinnacle level?” Ling Han asked Small Tower.

“Ascending Origin Tier is the transition into Celestial King Tier, to convert the Origin Power in one’s body into Source Power. There are three minor levels: small accomplishment, great accomplishment, and consummate, and every time you complete tempering and compression, it means that you have advanced to the next minor level.” Small Tower offered a very detailed explanation this time.

“Three times later, the Origin Power should be completely converted to Source Power, reaching a consummate state.

“If you are unable to reach the consummate level even after three times, you will have to do it again. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“And if you consume some specific natural treasures, you may be able to reach the consummate level in a single stroke.”

Realization dawned on Ling Han. “In other words, the three minor levels of Ascending Origin Tier have no clear dividing line. In truth, it depends on the purity level of Source Power. By the time you reach 100%, that would be perfection.”

“Hehe.” Small Tower laughed. This was its trademark mockery.

Ling Han did not take it to heart. No wonder that no matter how strong an Ascending Origin Tier was, they could not possibly compare to a Celestial King Tier, because this cultivation level was only a transition, converting Origin Power into Source Power. In terms of height of Regulations, they completely could not compare to Celestial Kings. Hence, they could not possibly reach or even surpass the level of Celestial Kings.

‘However, as long as I advance to the Ascending Origin Tier, and use Void Particle Energy to temper myself further, there is a chance that I can match Celestial King Tier.’

He couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation. To battle or even kill Celestial Kings as an Ascending Origin Tier would have to be very shocking, right?

“Wahaha, here is another rock!” Hu Niu suddenly called out loudly in excitement.

Another burning rock had indeed appeared ahead of them, but it was close to being extinguished. Clearly, this fire would not continuously burn. Instead, there was still a limit.

Ling Han extinguished the flames, and then stowed the rock into the Black Tower, in no rush to refine it.

They continued traveling. They were not the only brave people in this deep mountainous area. There were other elites, such as the disciples from the Heavenly Venerate Yellow Spring’s line, but this Heavenly Venerate was different from the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. He did not have the habit of taking disciples widely, but rather only had a mere three.

Aside from Liao Kong, the others were actually the Heavenly Venerate Yellow Spring’s first disciple, second disciple, or his grand-disciples.

Ling Han and his group battled with wild beasts, and battled with others as well. Two months’ time passed in the blink of an eye. They retreated from the mountainous area first to prevent their consciousness from being affected, as it’d turn them bloodthirsty and hungering for slaughter.

Even Small Tower was wary of that substance, so Ling Han no longer had the confidence that he could duck inside the Black Tower and hide.

They arrived outside the mountainous area. While waiting for the grayish substance in their bodies to slowly disappear, they began cultivating with the Chaos Source Rocks.

This time, they had collected a total of 17 Chaos Source Rocks, which differed in size. The largest was as big as a grindstone, but the smallest was only the size of a fist. However, size was not the only basis for judging the quality of a Chaos Source Rock. The purity level of the Source Power within was another factor.

Some rocks, while being large in size, did not contain much Source Power, and couldn’t compare to even a fist-sized rock.

“The volcano has stopped erupting,” someone suddenly exclaimed.

Ling Han and the others raised their heads and looked upwards. Indeed, the volcano that had been constantly erupting had already stopped, no longer gushing flames and lava outwards. In their place, there were multiple black clouds that were incredibly dense and soaring skywards.

This naturally led to another tsunami wave of entering into the mountainous area to contend for resources because there would no longer be any outpour of Chaos Source Rocks, so every single one collected meant one less.

Ling Han did not enter the mountain again. He checked himself, and there was actually not much of the grayish substance left. It was slightly influencing his emotions. Thankfully, after exiting the mountainous area, this kind of substance was also slowly decreasing, but if he climbed the mountain now, that would merely be courting death.
