Chapter 2096: Yin Soul Valley

Lu Hairong brought Ling Han and the others with her as she left, streaking through the air.

With an Eighth Heaven Celestial King standing guard, everything naturally progressed incredibly smoothly.

After traveling three days in a row, Lu Hairong finally stopped.

She had no choice but to stop, as Hu Niu was determined to eat.

Now that a glutton’s appetite had been stirred, it was completely impossible to stop.

They then sought out a place for a meal. Lu Hairong did not speak all this while, because she felt slightly apologetic towards Ling Han.

When they had been sniped by the Four Seas Palace, it was Ling Han who had protected Hu Niu. Otherwise, there would be nothing left for her to do. But previously, under the coercion of the three great Celestial Kings, she had chosen to give Ling Han up.

Though the danger had been dealt with now, she still felt slightly awkward.

“Next, should we first go to the Yin Soul Valley, or find the treasure?” Hu Niu asked as she ate, seeming to be very excited.

“Next, should we…” Xiao Gu echoed her while he ate.

“Don’t snatch Niu’s stuff!” Hu Niu was anxious. This damn Xiao Gu was actually grabbing the meat that she loved, and she hurriedly went to guard the food.

“Don’t snatch Niu’s stuff!” Xiao Gu also went to guard the food.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and said, “We had best head to the Yin Soul Valley first.”

All of them had reached peak stage Yang Soul. Without breaking through to Yin Soul, every day passed would simply be a waste of time.

“Sure!” Hu Niu declared with a clap of her hands.

Lu Hairong’s expression was a little dark. She was a great Celestial King, but not one of these people actually even had any signs of asking for her opinion!

However, firstly, Hu Niu was stubborn, and secondly, Lu Hairong was also curious about Xiao Gu’s origins, so her attention was focused on Xiao Gu.

The Empress drew out the map, and after a while of searching, she pointed at a spot on the map, announcing, “The closest Yin Soul Valley is… at the Dark Forest.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If we rush, we will need about half a month’s time, but if we were escorted by Senior Lu, two to four hours should be enough,” Ling Han said with a grin.

“Ugly hag, we’ll leave after eating.” Hu Niu immediately declared, sounding angry. This old demonic woman had actually planned to sacrifice Ling Han.

Lu Hairong could only nod in response. In front of Hu Niu, she, a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, did not even dare show the slightest bit of temper.

Even if Lu Hairong had not displayed any domineering air, a Celestial King was ultimately still a Celestial King. Carelessly leaking out a sliver of aura was already incredibly frightening. Thus, though there were quite a number of exquisitely beautiful women at their table, no one dared to approach and hit on them.

Their meal went very smoothly. In Ling Han’s eyes, this was a very inconceivable matter because they would encounter some kind of problem when they were dining at a restaurant most of the time.

With a turn of Lu Hairong’s slender hand, she brought them with her, and they continued their journey.

The speed of a Celestial King was too fast. Only after two hours, they had already arrived at the Dark Forest.

“Next, it will be up to you all,” Lu Hairong said. “Once you all have broken through, come to this place. I will be waiting here.”

After saying this, she already disappeared from sight with a flash.

She was really in a hurry, coming or leaving.

“Let’s go too!” Hu Niu took the lead, energetic as always.

Ling Han smiled, and walked off, holding hands with the Empress. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou followed behind them like a sulking wife. Xiao Gu acted dim, just like a silly goose.

The Dark Forest had always been very lively. This place was rich in a herb called “Numbing Clouds Mushroom”. Though it had not reached the extent of Celestial medicine, it was a supplementary ingredient that could not be missed in the concoction of a great many Celestial pills, and it was only capable of growing here.

Hence, there frequently were people who came to harvest herbs here. In fact, because of the needs of herb-gatherers, a small town had been slowly built in the forest, providing a place of rest for the herb-gatherers, also shielding them from the elements.

After about a day, they arrived at this small town.

There was no need to pay protection fees upon entering the town, but everything in the town was extraordinarily expensive, including accommodations. However, if one chose to rent accommodations, the innkeeper would ensure your safety, but if you chose to camp outside, and hide in your Spatial God Tool, there might be a sword stabbing directly at you the moment you left your Spatial God Tool.

Ling Han and the others left after only walking around the town. They had not come to gather Numbing Clouds Mushrooms, but had come to enter into the depths of the Dark Forest. There was a Yin Soul Valley there.

Hence, this forest was even livelier. There would always be Yang Soul elites coming here, heading into the Yin Soul Valley to proceed with their breakthrough.

Another three days later, Ling Han and the others finally arrived at the entrance into Yin Soul Valley.

Ordinarily, there were three great beauties in Ling Han’s party, and should have attracted some pesky bugs, but how could those who came here to collect herbs be any kind of elite? Thus, Dividing Soul Tier was definitely considered a great elite here, and who among them would dare come and court death?

It would be different once they entered into the Yin Soul Valley. They had all come for the sake of breaking through to Yin Soul, and all of them had the same cultivation level, so it was naturally inevitable that there would be some that wanted to fool around.

After Ling Han killed quite a few people in a row, finally no one dared to have any more inappropriate thoughts.

They traveled again for a few days, and a deep pool appeared ahead of them.

The pool waters were dark green and so deep that the bottom could not be seen.

This place was called the Jade Pool, and was the most Yin-aligned location[1]. Furthermore, there was something called Yin Soul Jade that would be nurtured inside this pool. It was the same as the Yang Soul Stone. Once it was fused into your spirit, you would then be able to form a spiritual body.

But how could the Yin Soul Jade be obtained from the Jade Pool?

Naturally, it was impossible to dive in. It was said that even an Ascending Origin Tier elite would be frozen to death by the coldness, and only a Celestial King would be able to endure it. However, how could anyone possibly get the help of a Celestial King just for the breakthrough of a Yang Soul?

Of course, it was impossible that this was the only way. Yang Souls similarly could still obtain the Yin Soul Jade. It would require cultivators to communicate through their own divine sense. If they succeeded, the Yin Soul Jade would fly out of the water on its own.

Then, could you draw it out first, and then hand it over to another?

No way!

Once it fell into the hands of another, the Yin Soul Jade would automatically crumble.

Thus, due to this aspect, it would be useless even if they could get the help of a Celestial King.

At the banks of the Jade Pool, there were a great many people seated in a cross-legged position. They were all concentrating on communicating with the Yin Soul Jade in the pool.

There were indeed a lot of people. Some were seated very far back, while some were seated very close to the front.

It could not be helped. The cold air from the pool was soaring, and there were powerful Regulations of Water contained within this coldness. Even a Yang Soul monarch tier could not possibly walk up to the pool. They would have long since been frozen into an icicle.

It was said that the closer to the pool of water that one managed to stimulate the Yin Soul Jade, the higher the quality of Yin Soul Jade that they would obtain.

“Come on then.”

Ling Han and his party all walked forwards, while Xiao Gu roamed around, idling his time away, and trying to find a new target for imitating speech.

Even the weakest of the four of them was an emperor tier, and could be ranked into the upper echelons of emperor tiers at that. Thus, it was natural that they passed all the others, and arrived at the foremost position.

After all, how could there be so many emperor tiers and monarch tiers in this world? In fact, there were only a very limited number of even just king tiers. If some kind of gathering of cultivators was held, or a Mystery Realm that would only open once every 100,000,000 years opened, only then would there be various prodigies popping out and as many king tiers as stray dogs.

“These four people are really powerful!”

“They have already walked to the very front.”

“This natural talent, tsk, they are probably all king tiers!”

“This makes me so envious!”

A king tier could suppress his peers, and was high and noble, which naturally induced the envy of others.

“That should probably be their limit by now.” Everyone was staring at Ling Han and his party, and made their judgement. That should probably be the limit of king tiers.

But the four people did not look like they were going to stop there in the slightest.

“Heavens, why are they still walking forwards?”

“Could it be… they are not king tiers, but rather emperor tiers!?”
