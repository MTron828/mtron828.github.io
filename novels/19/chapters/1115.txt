Chapter 1116: Want a Reward?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“It should be a puppet. Otherwise, one would have needed to form the fifth Mountain River to reach eight stars of power.”

“If it had really formed the fifth Mountain River, I do not believe such a being would agree to being a guard of the door here.”

“But if it really is a puppet, what do we do?”

Puppets had no vital points, knew no pain, and aside from the fact that their brains were a little dumb, they were practically a perfect fighting machine, and there was no way around them.

They had more or less confirmed this. This demonic tiger’s defenses had surpassed the limits of Mountain River Tier, and it was already invincible by nature, so how were they supposed to defeat it?

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then answered, “There are two possibilities.

“Firstly, there is a limit to the amount of time a puppet can move. We would only need to persist for a certain amount of time, and it would naturally stop attacking.”

“And secondly, we do not have to destroy the puppet, but merely take the key.”

The others nodded respectively. This could not possibly be irresolvable, or it would have lost the meaning of existence.

“Let’s take the key!”

They immediately came to a decision. It was very simple: even if this demonic tiger had a limit to the amount of time it could move, they did not know how long that period of time would be. Hence, it was naturally best for them to take the key, and this was also the crux of their problem.

“Brother Ling and I will be responsible for drawing the attention of this demonic tiger, and you guys take the chance to snatch the key,” Shao Sisi said. She once again drew out her bow and arrow, and aimed right at the eyes of the demonic tiger, shooting arrow after arrow.

So rich!

Usually, Ling Han could not bear to use the Godly Arrows he had obtained, because there were only so many of them. The moment he shot them out and did not manage to retrieve them, that would mean one less arrow in his possession.

Shao Sisi, on the other hand, continued to shoot arrow after arrow without stop, and she did not look like she had the slightest intention of retrieving them. He really had no idea exactly how many arrows she had actually brought.

As expected of the princess of the Thousand Frost Majestic Empire, rich and imposing!

Ling Han sighed, and cheered himself up to continue to stand strong against this demonic tiger on the frontline to gain time and create an opening for the others.

Du An and the others, meanwhile, began attacking the collar that had the key hanging from it. After a few times, they looked immensely pleased because though the collar was also very sturdy, it was not unbreakable.

With this, their confidence naturally increased greatly, and they were strongly on the offensive.

After a few hundred attacks, the collar was finally broken. However, this was only a collar, and it was useless for them to just create a hole in it. It was still firmly hanging on the neck of this demonic tiger, so they had to create another hole on the other side—only then would the collar finally drop.

“F***, can you guys get a move on!” Ling Han gritted his teeth. He was enduring all the firepower from the Demonic Beast. Those were the attacks of a being at the peak stage of the consummate level with eight stars of strength. That was practically about Sun Moon Tier-level, and even if his physique was comparable to Level Four Godly metal, he could not hold on much longer.

If it were not for the effects of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, continuously healing his body, he would have been killed who knew how many times over.

“We’re close!”

Even Shao Sisi had joined the team that was attacking the collar. She shot out arrow after arrow, and they were all hitting the same place.

Because none of them would dare fight this demonic tiger at close quarters, they could only shoot out Sword Rays, Saber Rays, Fist Rays, and other such long-distance attacks. Their power was naturally slightly weaker, which also caused severing the collar take a considerably long amount of time.

After clost to an hour had passed, a ding was heard. The collar had finally been broken in half, and while the upper half was still stuck on the neck of the demonic tiger, the lower half had already dropped down.

And on it, the key was attached.

Ling Han hurriedly retreated, creating some distance between himself and the demonic tiger, whereas the others took advantage of the opening to pick the key up and rushed towards those big doors.

They pushed the key in, and after turning the key, the great doors slowly opened.

“Run!” Ling Han called out at Shui Yanyu. It was necessary for all of them to pass through at this point, and even one less person would be considered as a failure.

The two weaker ones of the bunch, Shui Yanyu and the spear-wielding man, left first, followed by Shao Sisi and the others, whereas Ling Han tailed behind. He made use of the pillar and circled around it before turning right around to charge ahead of the demonic tiger, and leaped towards those big doors.

“Ang!” the demonic tiger released a furious roar, and chased after him.

“Quick! Quick!” At the entrance, Du An and the others were calling out anxiously. Even Xia Wuque and the spear-wielding man were no exceptions, and the demonic tiger was already approaching closer and closer behind him.

Shua , the demonic tiger shot out a paw, and smacked it out at Ling Han.

If it landed a solid hit, Ling Han would definitely be sent veering away from his original course, and thus smash into the wall on the side instead of charging out the big doors.

“Hmph!”

Ling Han drew out the Ultimate Arrow. Though he was wielding himself like a bow, the might released was still very frightening. Origin Power condensed, and turned into a stream of light that shot out.

Pu!

The arrow of Origin Power landed on the paw of the demonic tiger, but facing what possibly could be defenses comparable to Level Five Godly metal, even the Ultimate Arrow could not penetrate it. However, this was an attack that had Ling Han’s full power behind it; with the frighteningly powerful impact, the tiger’s paw still veered off slightly.

Hu , this paw missed Ling Han by a hair’s breadth.

And Ling Han shot out, flying out the huge doors.

Peng , he fell onto the ground, feeling weak all over. He had no way of regulating the might of this Ultimate Arrow. The moment he used it, he would definitely expend all the energy in his body, not leaving the slightest drop behind.

Thankfully, as his cultivation level increased, the rate at which he recovered his power was also extremely fast. It would only be a matter of a few hours for him to recover completely.

The demonic tiger stopped at the entrance, and did not pursue them out. It was as if an invisible wall was stopping it from going further.

It roared for a while, and they saw the great doors slowly close, placing it firmly on the outside.

The 10 of them sighed in relief. They had finally forced their way in.

However, had they actually passed the first stage, or was it one of the tests of the first stage?

They turned around, and looked around carefully.

This was another great hall, and was an incredibly large one. In the center, there was a stone tablet standing upright. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Congratulations for passing the first stage,” a voice suddenly spoke from the stone tablet.

Everyone experienced a shock.

“Hoho, don’t be nervous. This is only a sliver of consciousness that I have left behind. As for the real me, hehe, I am not going to tell you!” the stone tablet said. Merely a few words from it were enough to engender anyone’s fury, making the 10 of them very much want to give it a good beating.

Unfortunately, this was only a remaining sliver of consciousness, so how were they supposed to accomplish that?

Ling Han was immediately sure that it must have been left behind by the owner of the tomb because it was extremely narcissistic and was practically asking to be beaten, having the same style as the message on the stone table that appeared when the stone statue formation concluded. However, this time, the tomb owner was playing a new trick, and actually left behind a sliver of divine sense to joke around.

“Want a reward? If you do, beg me!” the stone tablet continued.

They all looked at one another. Was this really a great senior and ultimate elite? Why did he seem to be quite shameless?

“Passing the first stage should have a reward, right?” Ling Han deduced. “Since that is so, then no matter if we beg or not, we would still be able to obtain the reward. So why should we beg then!”

“Aaaah!! I’m about to die of fury. What harm would it do if you begged me a little? Would you die from it?” the stone tablet abruptly cried out.

Everyone decided to simply remain silent by now. This great elite and senior seemed to be out of touch completely.

“Fine then. Rules are rules. I shall give you a little reward, then.” The stone tablet calmed down, and its tone was much calmer than before.
