Chapter 1157: A New Age

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han continued his frenzied attack on Wu Zhe. He was hellbent on defeating him and making him open his mouth to admit defeat. He owed this to the Rain Emperor.

However, he had to admit that seeds were indeed supreme prodigies. Wu Zhe was a king tier among the seeds, so he was naturally incredibly powerful.

Ling Han had cultivated each major tier to a state of perfection, but he wasn’t the only person in the world who had achieved this.

At least, Wu Zhe was also a prodigy who had achieved this. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If Ling Han hadn’t formed five Mountains and Rivers, he would have been a mere sandbag before Wu Zhe, regardless of how prodigious he was. Now, however, there was no significant difference in strength between them.

However, Ling Han possessed a physique that made him truly invincible against those at the same cultivation level as him. This was a massive advantage, and it allowed him to attack with more freedom and less worry. In other words, he could place more of his focus and energy into attacking.

On the other, Wu Zhe was indeed able to “wound” Ling Han after activating a secret technique, yet he definitely wouldn’t be able to maintain this level of offense.

The two of them exchanged blows, and both of them shed blood.

“Heavens! Mountain River Tier cultivators can actually become this powerful!”

“Compared to them, it’s as if I’m a weak cultivator who still hasn’t reached the Mountain River Tier yet!”

“I definitely have to form five Mountains and Rivers!”

Everyone clasped their heads and exclaimed in shock. Meanwhile, many people decided that they wouldn’t break through to the Sun Moon Tier unless they formed five Mountains and Rivers. This had a significant influence on the Majestic Heaven Sect, as some time in the future, several people from this cohort did indeed manage to form five Mountains and Rivers. However, many more people remained stuck at the Mountain River Tier for life, not even being able to reach the Sun Moon Tier.

After all, forming five Mountains and Rivers was tremendously difficult, even for seed-level prodigies.

Ling Han roared ferociously as he unleashed his own Sword Dao. Not only was the combination of the Fast Technique and the Sword of the Great Dao quick, but it also possessed a devastating destructive ability.

This was his own dao, and he had named it the “Lightning Sword Technique”.

He had chosen the word lightning as it represented the fastest speed in the world. In addition, the might of lightning was also extremely terrifying. This was analogous to his own dao.

Moreover, just like how the Rain Emperor’s Son of Heaven Fist Technique would evolve along with the elevation of his cultivation level, the might of the Lightning Sword Technique would also increase along with the elevation of Ling Han’s cultivation level.

This was because the Lightning Sword Technique wasn’t a fixed technique. Rather, it was a type of Intent Realm and a technique that displayed one’s comprehension of the great dao.

Shua, shua, shua!

It was as if Ling Han had become one with his Divine Demon Sword, and the might of his Lightning Sword Technique was elevated to an all-new height.

Wu Zhe grunted in exertion. He had already been on the ropes just then, when Ling Han still hadn’t retrieved his God Tool yet. So, how could his situation have improved now that Ling Han was wielding his Divine Demon Sword? This was a God Tool that had been nurtured by Ling Han, and thus it was connected to his heart and mind. As such, Ling Han could maximize the might of this God Tool.

Wu Zhe was forced onto his back foot, and he eventually went from returning five strikes for every 10 strikes to returning one strike for every 10 strikes. Although he hadn’t lost in the sense of the word yet, everyone knew that he had, in fact, already lost.

He had lost, and there was not a single excuse to make.

He and Ling Han were at the same cultivation level, and his strength was clearly inferior!

Everyone remained silent. However, there was excitement on many people’s faces. Wu Zhe and the others had already occupied the positions of king tier for far too long. It was about time for the next generation to step up and usurp their positions.

And, the person who had fired the first shot was none other than Ling Han!

The new disciples of the sect had all arrived with big dreams and ambitions. Upon witnessing Ling Han’s might, their confidence all increased 100-fold. They yearned to reach the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier as doing so would allow them to challenge—even replace—the older generation of king tiers, just as Ling Han had.

Ling Han’s battle was a prelude that opened the curtains to a new age.

After several more exchanges, Wu Zhe was sent flying by a strike from Ling Han’s sword. A gaping wound was cut into his chest, and it would have been even more serious had Ling Han not had mercy on him. In fact, he would’ve been cut into two at the waist.

This was only a spar, and Ling Han was only seeking justice for the Rain Emperor—the two of them weren’t archenemies who were hell-bent on fighting to the death.

However, Wu Zhe had been defeated before all the other seeds, so it was reasonable to assume that he would hate Ling Han’s guts from this moment on.

Wu Zhe stared daggers at Ling Han before angrily turning around and leaving. He paid no attention to the fact that this gathering still had yet to conclude.

“That, um, Junior Brother Wu, where are the tea leaves?” Ling Han asked with a chuckle. Since enmity had already been bred between them, he didn’t mind making it even worse.

Wu Zhe paused midstep. He then tossed 10 sparkling and crystal-like tea leaves down without so much as a glance back. This was none other than the 10 pieces of Serene Poplar Tea Leaves that he had promised. However, he had tossed them toward He Tao, not Ling Han.

He continued to stride away, and he quickly descended from the mountain peak and disappeared into the lingering clouds and mists that surrounded the mountain.

Ling Han clapped his hands indifferently as he returned to his seat. He shut his eyes, and it appeared as if he were napping.

His expression was relaxed, yet this caused a strong sense of wariness to grip He Tao and the other king tiers’s minds.

In terms of battle prowess alone, he was genuinely not much stronger than Wu Zhe. However, he possessed the Divine Demon Sword, which was an immensely powerful God Tool. Even though it wasn’t a Level Four God Tool yet, it was already starting to display an overwhelming might.

Moreover, he possessed an astounding physique that allowed him to disregard a significant portion of his opponent’s attacks.

However, were there secret techniques or God Tools that could threaten his physique?

At least, his physique wouldn’t be undefeatable before he reached the level of Saint King.

In any case, one couldn’t underestimate the six kings just because one of their members had lost a battle. If they were forced into a life-and-death battle, who knew how many trump cards they could unleash? Who knew what kind of terrifying power they could summon?

Of course, Ling Han was only being vigilant and cautious. He still maintained the belief that he was invincible at the same cultivation level.

There was a look of zeal on Ding Ping’s face as he looked at his master.

His master was far too powerful!

This was his master, someone who could always surprise and shock others. People had said that he didn’t have the right to enter the Majestic Heaven Sect before, yet he had instantly jumped out and proved them wrong. People had said that the six kings were invincible just then, yet Wu Zhe had been clinically and ruthlessly disposed of.

He definitely had to follow the example of Ling Han. He didn’t yearn to surpass him; he merely wished that he wouldn’t lose face for his master and bring disrepute to his mighty name.

The sparring matches continued.

However, after witnessing the mighty battle between Ling Han and Wu Zhe, the ensuing battles all seemed boring to the extreme. The spectators were all bored, and as a result, those who were sparring also became bored. It wasn’t long before no one else stepped up to battle. The seed-level prodigies started to discuss their understandings of cultivation.

Those gathered here were all supreme prodigies, though it was still impossible for them to be perfect in every single aspect. Rather, they each had their own strengths and weaknesses. Thus, they frequently nodded in agreement, even if they were only listening to the unique views of someone at the low extreme.

The atmosphere became increasingly lively, and none of them kept their understandings a secret from others. Of course, things like secret techniques definitely wouldn’t be shared with others. Doing so wouldn’t be generous; it would be incredibly foolish.

Ling Han also learned a lot. His Lightning Sword Technique was based on the understanding and destruction of the great dao, and thus the comprehension of others also provided him with ideas and inspiration.

He generously shared some of his understandings as well, though he obviously didn’t share his core understandings, such as the Lightning Sword Technique.

“Hehe, the water has finished boiling. Let’s drink some tea,” He Tao said with a smile. Wisps of steam were finally drifting out from the small teapot. However, the steam strangely didn’t dissipate. Instead, it formed into all kinds of mysterious shapes.

As expected of divine water! The contents of this teapot were as valuable as an entire city!
