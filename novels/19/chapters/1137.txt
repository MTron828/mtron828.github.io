Chapter 1138: Analyzing the Divine Patterns

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The Goddess Furnace became more and more mangled as it was ferociously punched by Ling Han. Right now, it was so disfigured that it couldn’t even be called a furnace anymore.

Initially, Ling Han had still needed to use an Origin Power shield to protect his clothes. However, he retracted this shield after being absorbed into the furnace. So be it if his clothes were incinerated. His physique was already on par with Level Five Godly metal anyway, so even elites at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier would find it extremely, extremely, extremely difficult to injure him.

He put all of his power behind his attacks, and at this moment, his fists could be seen as a pair of Level Five God Tools. They were shrouded in divine patterns and brimming with destructive power.

“Huh?!”

Ling Han aggressively destroyed a section of the furnace. However, this furnace had been forged from several layers of Godly metal, and thus the furnace wasn’t punctured even though he had destroyed a layer. Rather, the layer of Godly metal behind it appeared before him.

Ling Han saw a divine pattern on this layer of Godly metal.

‘Haha, this is the martial intent left by some fire-element cultivator. I can use it for reference and learn from it.’ Ling Han was overjoyed, and he immediately stopped his attacks and started to analyze the divine pattern.

This divine pattern wasn’t complete, with only a small portion of it being visible. The rest of it was hidden behind the most internal layer of Godly metal.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

He started to unleash his devastating attacks again.

Only when the entire divine pattern was revealed did Ling Han stop his attacks. He continued to analyze the divine pattern.

Just like that, he would launch ferocious attacks one moment, and then stop to analyze the divine patterns the next. The people outside didn’t know this, so they found this situation to be extremely strange.

‘What on earth is going on?

‘He’s incredibly ferocious at times, and smashes the furnace so relentlessly that it appears as if it’s going to explode. However, he suddenly stops attacking and goes completely quiet at other times. Is he resting inside?!’

“Humph! Who can escape from the Goddess Furnace?” Gan Shiyun said haughtily. If this were the real Goddess Furnace, even Heavenly Body Tier elites could be forcefully refined.

Everyone nodded in agreement. By the looks of it, Ling Han was already a spent force. It had already been a long time since they had heard him attacking the furnace.

Sure enough, this Goddess Furnace was incredibly powerful.

Hu Feiyun tilted her head upward, and confidently said, “Humph! Ling— Han Lin definitely won’t be refined!” In her mind, Ling Han was invincible. Right now was also no exception.

“What an absolute joke! He’s already been trapped in the Goddess Furnace, so how can he escape?” Fu Liangye said in scorn.

Gan Shiyun smiled coldly, and said, “You said that the fool isn’t dead yet? Then tell him to give a shout!”

Peng!

Another fist-shaped dent appeared on the Goddess Furnace at this moment, causing the entire furnace to shudder.

This... She had just asked Hu Feiyun to have Ling Han give a shout, and he had responded the very next moment. The devastating power of his punch was more than enough to prove that he was still alive and well.

Gan Shiyun’s and Fu Liangye’s expression darkened. This was utter humiliation! It was as if they had been slapped across the face!

Hu Feiyun couldn’t help but laugh in a silvery voice. It was just as she had expected. How could Ling Han be restrained by this mere furnace?

Meanwhile, Ling Han had already finished analyzing the first divine pattern in the Goddess Furnace. Thus, he started to attack the Goddess Furnace again. After destroying a nearby section of Godly metal, he stopped his attacks and continued to analyze the divine patterns.

He had the Black Tower and the Reincarnation Tree, so one day’s comprehension was equivalent to one year’s worth. Thus, the speed of his comprehension was incredible.

The entirety of the second divine pattern was finally revealed after he destroyed another layer of Godly metal. Ling Han memorized this divine pattern, and then entered the Black Tower to comprehend it under the Reincarnation Tree. This way, he would be able to understand and master this divine pattern as quickly as possible.

Another divine pattern of flame had already appeared on his Mountains and Rivers.

It wasn’t long before he exited the Black Tower.

Peng, peng, peng!

The third divine pattern was revealed after another burst of ferocious attacks. Ling Han started his comprehension again.

The people outside were completely stumped. The person inside would attack for a while, and then suddenly stop. What on earth was he doing? Some thought that he was on the verge of being refined, yet he would continue to launch devastating attacks once in a while. Others thought that he could escape from the furnace, yet he would suddenly stop after attacking for a while.

‘What the hell are you doing?!’

The people outside were almost driven crazy.

After a few hours, Ling Han had already destroyed all of the internal layers of the Goddess Furnace. He had also analyzed and grasped all of the divine patterns. However, he still hadn’t had enough, and he wondered just how good it would be if he could analyze the real Goddess Furnace.

It was a shame that the Goddess Furnace was a precious treasure of the Gan Clan. That being the case, how could he possibly analyze and comprehend it?

Generally speaking, God Tools were all nurtured and formed by the martial intent of cultivators. They would be inscribed with one’s comprehension of the great dao, and such comprehensions would reveal themselves in the form of divine patterns. Thus, analyzing these divine patterns was equivalent to analyzing a cultivator’s martial intent.

Of course, not all divine patterns were worthy of being analyzed and mastered. However, it would only take a glance for one to determine whether a divine pattern was worth studying or not. After all, how could Immortals not possess such judgment?

In any case, Ling Han had already grasped all of the divine patterns, so there was no point in him staying in the Goddess Furnace for any longer.

Ling Han sighed in disappointment. Why didn’t this Goddess Furnace give him more divine patterns to comprehend? These divine patterns of flames were extremely helpful to him.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

He started to unleash his full power against the Goddess Furnace. He was like an enraged ape, and the Goldy metal in the furnace was destroyed layer by layer.

Although this Goddess Furnace was only a replica, it was still extremely sophisticated. It was forged from nine layers of Godly metal, with divine patterns inscribed into each layer. It was especially mighty, and it was basically indestructible!

At least for cultivators at the Mountain River Tier.

However, Ling Han was an exception. One had to realize that his physique was on par with Level Five Godly metal. Not only that, but his power could also surpass seven stars, with his fists being almost as powerful as Level Five God Tools.

The Goddess Furnace was no match for Ling Han, and it was destroyed layer by layer.

The onlookers had already become accustomed to this banging sound as they had heard it every once in a while. However, they quickly realized that this time was different.

Because... the banging sound had gone on for far too long!

Boom!

A hand suddenly reached out from the Goddess Furnace. At the same time, a giant crack appeared on this furnace that had already been beaten beyond recognition.

Peng!

There was another deafening boom, and the crack grew even larger, revealing a youthful face.

It was Ling Han!

Gasp!

Everyone drew a sharp breath. Judging by his relaxed expression, he hadn’t been wounded a single bit.

This was the Goddess Furnace! Yet, it had actually been brutally smashed open. Not only that, but the culprit was actually unscathed!

“Oh!” Ling Han had initially wanted to climb out, but he suddenly faltered, and said, “Hang on a second!” He retrieved some clothes from the Black Tower and put them on. With that done, he swung his fists a few more times and blasted open a hole that was large enough for him to get through. He then casually stepped out.

Gan Shiyun’s face twitched in disbelief. That was the Goddess Furnace! Although it was a replica, it was still a precious treasure. She had only been bestowed with this treasure because she was the most prodigious clan member of her generation.

However, this God Tool that she took so much pride in had actually been destroyed before her very eyes? She was unable to accept this.

Could it be that Ling Han was actually a humanoid God Tool? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Compensate me for the Goddess Furnace!” she screamed in a high-pitched voice. This precious treasure belonged to the clan, and she had only been bestowed with the right to use it. She didn’t own it.

“Compensate you for what? This is my spoils of battle.” Ling Han stowed the remains of the Goddess Furnace into his Black Tower. Although it wasn’t a God Tool anymore, he couldn’t waste the materials. He could use it to elevate the quality of his Divine Demon Sword.

“Y-y-you...!” Gan Shiyun was seething with rage. Not only was Ling Han not planning to compensate her for the Goddess Furnace, but he had even taken its remains for himself. He had gone too far!
