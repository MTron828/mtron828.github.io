Chapter 565: Flaunting Strength

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

The experienced man earlier was proven wrong once again. This girl who looked somewhat klutzy and cute was clearly more terrifying than the little girl. Her battle prowess was astounding, proven by her demolishing four Corpse Soldiers in only one round.

“Amongst middle state’s geniuses, there’s going to be one more new person,” he exclaimed.

“There won’t be any more similar freaks, right?” someone interrupted.

“Definitely not!” the man said with extreme certainty. Two such exceptional talent emerging in one day was already a great miracle, so how could it possibly happen over and over again?

Helian Xun Xue was still in shock, and as she looked at four skeletons that were smacked into disarray, she couldn’t help but pat her flat chest, saying curiously, “So I’m actually this remarkable?”

Han Gu Yun was now in a dilemma.

The strongest thing about the Thousand Corpse Sect was definitely Corpse Soldiers, but four of them were smacked into dregs at the same time; if she charged up, wouldn’t she just be giving up her life? However, seeing her opponent’s figure which hadn’t a single bit of the aura of an expert, having just surprising brute force, if she retreated without fighting, wouldn’t that be too embarrassing?

“Ninth, back down,” Bai Yuan said. He was a Heaven Tier elite with shrewd insight, and obviously saw that though Helian Xun Xue lacked battle experience, her strength was too too powerful. She only needed to battle with her instincts to win against her opponent because her level had already surpassed the Flower Blossom Tier.

Even if the third went up to face her, it would be useless; the first or the second had to come.

“We all forfeit the next few battles. Lady, you’re quite good. Do you have any interest in joining our sect?” Bai Yuan began to poach; this muddled and klutzy girl seemed to be easily deceived.

“Don’t want to!” Helian Xun Xue hurriedly shook her head as she looked at the top of the city wall towards Ling Han, revealing a pitiful expression. She wanted to go back, but it was too high.

Ling Han guided patiently and said, “Jump up on your own, you can do it.”

Helian Xun Xue kept shaking her head, and said, “It’s too high, I can’t jump up.” She had absolutely no confidence.

“If you don’t try, how would you know?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Helian Xun Xue pouted and leapt with all her effort. Xiu , she instantly soared into the sky, not only leaping far beyond the city walls, but also far beyond it, turning into a small black dot.

After a short while, peng , a ball of light suddenly exploded in the skies.

“Not good, she bumped into the city’s large formation!”

“Though the great formation is mainly for defense, ramming it on one’s own accord will still trigger the great formation’s impact; even Deity Transformation Tier elites would be annihilated.”

“It’s over.”

Peng!

At this moment, a figure fell heavily downwards, plunging into the city walls. Under the powerful impact, a section of the city walls collapsed. Amidst the dust-filled air, a silhouette walked out, staggering.

And who else could it be other than Helian Xun Xue?

Everyone’s faces twitched involuntarily. This girl rammed into the great city-guarding formation; just how powerful was her physique for her to be as if nothing happened??

“Ow, ow, ow, ow!” Helian Xun Xue covered her head and groaned, but she was unscathed from top to bottom, leaving everyone speechless.

Ling Han also came to a painful realization. No wonder he was still firmly dominated by her despite losing her memory and being unable to use Origin Power. This wasn’t a coincidence; rather, this girl’s cultivation had reached a terrifying degree. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Helian Xun Xue was like a child who had been wronged as she walked to Ling Han’s side and pulled on the hem of his clothes, looking like she was about to cry. Looking on, everyone was speechless; if anything, or anyone, were to cry, it would be the Thousand Corpse Sect at the bottom and the great city-guarding formation in the sky.

Ling Han looked down, and said to Bai Yuan, “Now, we have a hundred and ninety quotas, right?”

“Right!” Bai Yuan nodded, looking somewhat displeased. He absolutely never would’ve thought... he originally wanted to toughen these ten youngsters so as to avoid them being too proud and arrogant, but now it seemed like they were struck quite hard mentally.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang was alright, at least being rivaled by Ju Tian Ge, but the following appearance of Hu Niu and Helian Xun Xue absolutely just trampled on their confidence.

A six to seven year old little girl and a brute force freak... battling at the same age, they were absolutely invincible beings.

Now, the Thousand Corpse Sect was pressed for a win to boost their morale and increase the confidence of these nine youngsters.

Ling Han leapt down from atop the city wall, and said, “Then I’ll be you guys’ opponent, and earn a few more quotas to leave the city.”

Where did this youngster’s confidence come from?

Bai Yuan smiled grimly. Xuanyuan Zi Guang was in the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, which was rarely seen at this age segment; moreover, he cultivated 22 flashes of Qi, having terrifying strength. He couldn’t see through Hu Niu and Helian Xunxue, and those he was unable to see through were obviously out of the ordinary.

But Ling Han?

Second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier—obvious at a glance.

Even if this boy could surpass ten stars battle prowess, he would only have twenty stars battle prowess, and about half of the people here could crush him.

Alright, this boy could be used to boost their morale.

Bai Yuan nodded, and said, “Fourth, you go.”

The fourth, Tian Xiu Ning, ranked second in strength amongst the ten people. He was at the eighth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, and the amount of Corpse Soldiers he could control also reached five; he was not much inferior to Ju Tian Ge.

Directly letting Tian Xiu Ning take the field was a plan to acquire an overwhelming victory to boost morale.

Tian Xiu Ning walked out in large strides. He was nearly thirty years old, tall and sturdy, yet naturally bald. His forehead was glossy and didn’t even grow any eyebrows. His entire face gave people an extremely strange feeling.

Seeing this, Ling Han couldn’t help but smile and say, “Cultivating to the point of balding, your lordship is extraordinary as expected.”

The corner of Tian Xiu Ning’s mouth twitched involuntarily as he said, “Shoot your mouth off like that and ridicule carelessly more. This is only attracting disaster for your own life!”

“Oh, you want to take my life?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Just from your words just now, you should die!” Tian Xiu Ning said coldly.

“You truly have no sense of humor. Did you break your brain cultivating?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Impudence!” Tian Xiu Ning attacked with his palm, swatting at Ling Han. Black-colored Corpse Qi turned into a skeleton, biting towards Ling Han.

Ling Han flicked casually with his fingers, and pa, this skeleton instantly burst into pieces. He smiled slightly, and said, “Better summon the Corpse Soldiers. Your bit of strength truly isn’t enough.”

Pu!

Looking on, quite a few people spurted out. Although they only exchanged one move, and both parties didn’t use their full strength, Tian Xiu Ning was in the eighth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. To be able to neutralize his attack casually like that, Ling Han’s strength was not to be underestimated.

Tian Xiu Ning looked coldly at Ling Han. After a short while, he finally said, “Since you want to be tortured, then I’ll help you!”

He let out a battle cry, and instantly, a hong, long, long sound went off as five caskets slid over, and out jumped five Corpse Soldiers.

“There are actually five Corpse Soldiers!” an old fogey cried out. “The difference of a single corpse, the strength difference is worlds apart. Now, that youngster in danger!”
