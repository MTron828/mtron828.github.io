Chapter 2577: Luo Fuming

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Tang Yuan stared at Ling Han, his eyes filled with rage.

He could not imagine that a subordinate actually dared to disobey his command and turn hostile against him without any hesitation.

Had he devoured the courage of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Tang Yuan asked menacingly, “Li Long, do you know what you are doing?”

Peng!

A punch instantly landed on his face, and the person who had moved was naturally Ling Han.

Tang Yuan was furious, but before he had managed to make any threats, a large hand was already gripping his neck and wringing it tightly. In fact, even his bones were cracking loudly. A frightening martial intent surged out, causing him to become extremely weak. He couldn’t even breathe, and felt extremely suffocated. It was really possible that he would die of suffocation.

A boundless chill rose up inside him. Ling Han really would kill him, he really would.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Don’t be mistaken. I have never been your subordinate! Listen here, I can continue to go to the tournament, and I can also give up my salary, but do not come and disturb me. Otherwise, Luo Yang’s end will also be yours!”

Saying this, he withdrew his hand.

Tang Yuan was furious, angered, and shocked. Ling Han actually dared to threaten him?

How dare he!! How could he!!

It should be known that there was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King backing Tang Yuan up. No matter how awesome Ling Han was, how could he make an enemy of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Once his old man made a move, he would be able to destroy Ling Han easily.

To speak of nothing else, merely having Luo Yang’s old man, a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, move would be enough to thrash Ling Han into a harsh, absolute defeat.

He definitely could not overcome this difficulty, but he actually dared be insolent and lay out conditions in front of him. F***, just what kind of brains did this guy have?

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but recall A’Yuan. This man had killed one of his subordinates, and that victim, too, was the descendant of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. In fact, A’Yuan had even wounded Yang Xiaoling, but why didn’t anything happen to him?

Even if those two mighty figures would not make a move on Lu Li, how could it be that his name would be great enough to have two Celestial Kings not dare to make a move on even just a subordinate?

What was going on with Ghost King City recently?

Tang Yuan very much wanted to be strong-willed and explode, but when he immediately thought about how his neck was held in Ling Han’s grip, coldness instantly enveloped his whole body, and he involuntarily broke out in shivers.

Ling Han was a ruthless man, just like A’Yuan. The eyes he cast on him did not carry the slightest bit of emotion, as if he was just an ice-cold corpse.

If they fell out now, who here could manage to stop Ling Han?

Since Ling Han dared to kill Luo Yang, he had already caused great trouble anyways, so what would killing him too count as?

Moreover, Tang Yuan was very interested in Ling Han’s suggestion as well. That was because he was an extreme spendthrift, and had a great demand for money. Furthermore, the investment he had made in Ling Han was far from making adequate returns yet, so he presently was really quite poor.

Then it would be up to Luo Yang’s old man then.

If Ling Han could escape from a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, then Tang Yuan would not mind manipulating Ling Han. This kind of hired thug was still quite useful. Furthermore, Tang Yuan had not gotten his revenge on Lu Li yet.

After Tang Yuan made use of Ling Han to earn enough money, and also got his revenge on Lu Li, he would then have him killed.

Or so Tang Yuan thought. He was indeed a spoilt profligate, but at the same time, he was also very realistic.

“Agreed!” he replied, nodding, but there was no hint of joy on his face at all.

Everyone was stunned. They had not expected that Tang Yuan would actually agree. After all, when had this man ever suffered such humiliation? But upon further thought, now that Ling Han possessed crushing power, how could it be that Tang Yuan could manage to fall out with him?

It was just like in the tournament grounds previously, when A’Yuan had held his sword to Tang Yuan’s neck. Hadn’t Tang Yuan shrunk back as well?

Actually, this guy just depended on the fact that he had an old man that was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Putting this fact aside, he was no more than the most average Celestial King.

Still, Luo Yang’s body had not even cooled completely, yet he had just set the matter aside like this. How could this not cause disappointment?

If they stayed with this kind of boss, would he suddenly turn around and betray them as well?

Yet Tang Yuan was in no mood to be concerned about such matters. Though he had agreed to the compromise, he had also been embarrassed completely, so how could he be concerned about others? WIth a sweep of his sleeves, he strode off.

…He had to have Ling Han battle Lu Li’s Blood Martial King as soon as possible, and then he would have Ling Han battle continuously, squeezing out every single bit of value from him.

Of course, the prerequisite was that Ling Han could overcome the hurdle that was Luo Yang’s old man. Luo Fuming was not the type to just submit to humiliation.

As expected, the day hadn’t even ended, and Luo Fuming was already here.

“Greetings, Uncle Luo!” Tang Yuan personally went to receive him. Even if he held a high opinion of himself, in front of this helpful subordinate of his old man, he had to exhibit the necessary respect as well. Otherwise, if all these people were chased off to become the subordinates of his competitors, what could a general without an army do?

Luo Fuming nodded, his expression very ugly as he demanded, “Is that evil brat who killed Luo Yang still here at your manor?”

“Yes,” Tang Yuan answered.

“He killed Luo Yang, and you actually did not just tie him up and deliver him to me?” Luo Fuming asked, his tone bearing apparent displeasure. ‘Are you planning to cover for this boy?’

Tang Yuan felt very wronged. In truth, he very much wanted to kill Ling Han as well; the latter actually dared to threaten him! But firstly, Tang Yuan could not bear the monetary loss, and secondly, he did not have the required strength, either. He could only tell the truth. “To be honest, Uncle Luo, that evil brat is very strong, and has now turned the tables around on me. Even I cannot do anything against him!”

“Oh?” Luo Fuming was shocked. He had been home, and then saw the dead body of his son delivered to his doorstep. After finding out who the murderer was and where he was, he hurriedly charged over, and had not asked anything else at all.

He was startled internally, and thought of many things. That was because there was a storm brewing secretly in Ghost King City in recent times, and it seemed like things would be turned upside down soon. Could he be related to that?

Yet Tang Yuan did not know this. He said, “That man is called Li Long, and is a newly established Blood Martial King.”

‘F*ck!’

Rage immediately filled Luo Fuming’s expression, all his wariness disappearing without a trace.

He was just a mere Blood Martial King, and a new one at that. What need was there to fear him?

Immediately, he declared, “I will capture this person, bring him back, and kill him to avenge Yang’er. You won’t object, right?”

“Of course not,” Tang Yuan said. He knew this was a powerful subordinate of his father, and father would definitely not allow him to cause this subordinate to be at odds with him just for the sake of money and a private grudge.

Hence, if Luo Fuming was really planning to kill Ling Han, Tang Yuan would not step out on the latter’s behalf, either.

Moreover, he, too, very much wanted to see Ling Han die in front of him; it seemed like his neck was still slightly aching! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

With a sweep of his sleeve, Luo Fuming declared, “Lead the way!”

Tang Yuan led the way, and arrived at where Ling Han was staying. However, after a search, he did not discover Ling Han’s whereabouts at all.

“Nephew, where is he?” Luo Fuming asked menacingly.

Tang Yuan wiped away some sweat. He had indeed arranged for Ling Han to stay here, and had also deployed some people to monitor him from outside. They had clearly not seen him leave before.

“Nephew, have you really not covered for this evil brat?” Luo Fuming asked again. Did this brat dare to deceive even him?

A thought came suddenly to Tang Yuan. “That guy must have hidden himself in a Spatial God Tool!”

Luo Fuming spread out his divine sense, and began a search.

Only after a while, his divine sense locked down on a small box. Though it was hidden very well, he could still sense an unusual air about it.

This was… Divine Metal!

Instantly, his eyes lit up. It should be known that even he did not have a Celestial Tool, yet now a piece of Divine Metal was just laid out in front of him, so how could his heart not throb wildly?

The grief after his son’s death was immediately cast from his mind—even if his son had died, he could always have another, but if he missed out on Divine Metal, would he still have another chance?

Shua, right at this moment, a figure flashed. Ling Han appeared out of nowhere, the aura emanating from him strong and unstable.
