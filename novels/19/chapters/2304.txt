Chapter 2305: Worth of the Scroll

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ancestral King?” Wally asked. He faltered for a moment before a faint light started to flash in his eyes as if he were calculating something. After a moment, he said, “I understand. You’re talking about living beings who have a Vitality Index of over 5000. Indeed, there are two corpses of such living beings in this area. Moreover, their Vitality Indexes reached a peak of over 13,000 during their most powerful phase.

“In other words, they’re Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral Kings in the words of this realm,” he added.

‘Hang on... Two?’

Ling Han faltered for a moment before asking, “How are there two?”

“35 epochs ago, I followed a king to carry out a secret mission. However, he was discovered by an Ancestral King here, and the ensuing battle ended with the death of both of them.” Wally recounted an important event of the ancient past.

“When I was designed, my purpose was only to perform calculations and analyze data. I didn’t possess any combat abilities. The shock waves of the battle destroyed a large majority of my body, so it took me a very, very long time to recover to my original state.

“However, I also possess a powerful learning ability, so after taking inspiration from the battle, I also possess some combat capability now.”

“What’s your Vitality Index?” Ling Han asked in curiosity.

Light pulsated in Wally’s eyes, and he replied, “This information might threaten my life. It’s top-secret, so I can’t reveal it.”

‘F*ck”

“Then what was the secret mission you were carrying out?” Ling Han asked.

“My memory crystals were severely damaged during the battle, so I can’t recall,” Wally replied. This time, he didn’t refuse to answer by claiming that it was top-secret. However, he was even more clear-cut by saying he didn’t remember.

Ling Han decided to stop focusing on these “small details.” “Can you bring me to the two Ancestral King corpses? If you can help me obtain them, it’ll be even better.”

Wally immediately shook his head, saying, ‘Without an equal exchange, I won’t help you do anything.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Are you eyeing my sword again?”

“If you give me that sword...” Wally’s eyes pulsated for a moment, and he continued, “I can bring you to the corpses. I can also help you obtain one of them.”

‘Only one?’

However, this made sense. After all, just how rare were the corpses of Ninth Heaven Celestial King? One had to realize that Celestial Kings were unafraid of Immortal’s Tribulation. Theoretically speaking, they would possess a limitless lifespan. Moreover, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were almost invincible, so how could they die in normal circumstances?

It could be said that there were definitely fewer Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings than Divine Metal. As such, there were definitely even fewer dead Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

However, to exchange the Divine Demon Sword for one?

Ling Han wasn’t willing to do this. He reduced his request, and asked, “Then what if you only take me to the two corpses?”

‘One-ten-thousandth of the sword, Wally said.

Ling Han involuntarily grimaced. What was he going to do? Hack a piece off the Divine Demon Sword?

“You don’t only want that sword, right?’ He decided to fight for a better deal, and he said, “I still have many other valuable items on me. You can take a look.”

He retrieved Celestial medicines, Godly metal, and many other items from the Black Tower. However, Wally wasn’t interested in any of them. However, when Ling Han retrieved the ring of the Celestial King, Wally nodded and said, “This can be exchanged for half an Ancestral King corpse.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

‘F*ck! Half?’

wasn’t willing to give up, so he retrieved even more items. However, Wally’s standards were extremely high, and he showed absolutely no interest in Divine Metal and Celestial medicines, It wasn’t that these things were worthless, but rather that Wally had no need for them.

“You don’t eat Celestial medicines?”

Wally shook his head, and said, “I’m constructed from superstring materials, so only things that are close to the source of the world can increase the strength of my physique. These matters formed by the condensation of Regulations aren’t beneficial to me.”

Ling Han grimaced again. Superstring materials, things close to the source of the world, and matters formed by the condensation of Regulations... Were they speaking the same language?

Could they still converse properly?

A thought occurred to him, and he retrieved one of the scrolls that couldn’t be opened. “Then how about this?”

Wally looked over, and two beams of green light shot out from his eyes, scanning the scroll. His body then started to glow, pulsating between brilliance and dimness. This was a vigorous pulsation, and it was as if his emotion were undergoing huge swings.

“If you give me this, I can help you retrieve both of the Ancestral King corpses,” he said. His voice was still calm as always. However, the bright glimmer in his eyes gave him away.

He... wanted this!

was surprised. He knew that the two scrolls were definitely extraordinary since they couldn’t be drawn into the Black Tower.

Moreover, even the Divine Demon Sword couldn’t damage them.

However, Wally was actually willing to carry both of the Ancestral King corpses over for him? What did this signify?

This meant that these two scrolls were far more important than the Divine Demon Sword.

‘Gasp! They’re that incredible?’

Ling Han wasn’t suspicious of Wally. After all, this person wouldn’t tell lies, and he was a strong proponent for performing fair exchanges. He definitely wouldn’t take advantage of others.

In any case, Ling Han didn’t want to be taken advantage of, either, so he said, ‘You need to do more than just bring the two Ancestral King corpses over. You have to make it so that them two can also refine them.” He pointed at the Empress and Hu Niu.

Light pulsated in Wally’s eyes, and it was as if he were undergoing a huge mental battle. However, Ling Han knew that he was “calculating” again.

After a while, Wally nodded, and said, “Okay.”

Ling Han nodded in his mind. He had still underestimated the importance of the scrolls. One had to realize that bringing the Ancestral King corpses over and allowing the Empress and Hu Niu to refine them were two completely different matters. The difficulty of these tasks was completely different.

What in the world were these scrolls?

couldn’t help but ask this question. Wally didn’t conceal anything from him, and he replied, “This scroll is condensed from most fundamental power of the Genesis World. It can help me to a higher level.”

“Then what about us?” the Empress interjected.

“You guys can’t absorb it now,” Wally said with a shake of his heac “Then when do we have to wait until?” Bewitching Maiden Rou as]

“When your Vitality Index goes above 15,000,” Wally replied. “In 01 words, when you become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.”

‘F*ck! Only Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates can refine this?’

Ling Han found this inconceivable. Then what was the reason for these scrolls appearing?

“There exists a peculiar life force fluctuation around it,” Wally continued. “Only specific people can open it. They don’t need to wait until their Vitality Index goes above 15,000.”

These specific people clearly didn’t include them. After all, Ling Han, the Empress, and the others had all failed to open these two scrolls.

‘So-called Chosen Ones of heaven?’

“Then... what’s the benefit of opening it?” Ling Han asked.

“I know too little about it, so I’m unable to calculate and infer,” Wally replied in a calm voice. He seemingly lacked any sense of curiosity. In fact, he didn’t even urge Ling Han to hand the scrolls over,

“Then why can you refine it?” Ling Han asked. This was a key question. Perhaps Wally was as powerful as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

“The construct of my life force is different,” Wally replied, sounding as emotionless as always. “One of the materials used in my construction was condensed from the Source Power of heaven and earth. However, if I want to refine this, I need to spend 169,847,332 years, 105 days, 4 hours, 52 minutes, and 22 seconds.”

Hu Niu found this person extremely interesting. Why was he always so emotionless and expressionless when he spoke?

In any case, the conclusion was that Wally could refine this scroll. However, this would take an exorbitant amount of time. Taking into account the fact that only Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could open this scroll, however, 100,000,000 years truly wasn’t a long time..
