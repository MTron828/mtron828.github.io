2835 Rong Yang attacks

So after Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate fled, he immediately went to the Lin Clan.

As representative of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and as a Fourth Tier himself, Rong Yang naturally was a valued guest of the Lin Clan, and had been allocated an extremely elegant courtyard. Spiritual Qi had solidified here, and Celestial medicines were growing like they were ordinary flowers.

Knock, knock, knock. Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate knocked on the courtyard doors. The doors were clearly open, but he did not dare to enter without an invitation.

Rong Yang was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, someone capable of suppressing Jiuwu single-handedly, and the present world was too chaotic. Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate would also have to cozy up to the powerful Rong Clan, so he was naturally even more respectful.

“Enter.” A clear voice rang out from inside.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate entered, and he had not walked too far before he saw a white-robed young man sitting on the stone stool in the garden while sipping on tea leisurely.

He was Rong Yang, the only son of the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, Rong Tianyu. He had astonishing natural talent, and was already a Fourth Tier after cultivating for no more than seven epochs. Even Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was envious of him because he was still only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate even after cultivating for several dozen epochs.

At present, though Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had already reached the Third Tier, his accumulation of power for the advancement was already expended. Unless he could obtain a large number of Heavenly Venerable Seals, there was no way he could advance any further from this.

“Greetings, Lord Rong!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate clasped his hands in respect. Heavenly Venerate was only the name of a whole group, but with differences in cultivation level, there was naturally an absolute difference in status.

Rong Yang nodded slightly, and was still sipping on his tea as he asked calmly, “What has happened?”

“Rong Xinkuan is dead.” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate bowed his head slightly.

“En?” Rong Yang immediately raised a brow. Boom! An aura spread out from him, and all the Celestial medicines within his vicinity immediately wilted simultaneously. They had not been killed by his power. Instead, it was because his aura was too strong, so even Celestial medicines could not bear it.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate also felt a slight suffocation in his heart, feeling pain that made him have an urge to cough up blood. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He related the events that had occurred completely, and did not twist anything. However, he did leave out the process of how he had egged Rong Xinkuan on, and emphasized that Rong Xinkuan had only gone there so he could obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal for Rong Yang’s sake.

Rong Yang was silent, but very soon the air around him bubbled, and then shattered as multiple tiny holes leading into the Void appeared.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate couldn’t help but feel inwardly shocked. He naturally could also tear a rip into the Void if he went all out, but he definitely could not have done it as casually as Rong Yang had.

A Fourth Tier was a Fourth Tier, even if Rong Yang was only an early stage Fourth Tier.

“Since you went with Xinkuan, why had you not managed to protect him?” Rong Yang finally spoke.

“This is my fault.” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate bowed his head, making no excuses.

He had long since expected this. No matter how well he threw the blame off of himself, Rong Xinkuan had still died, so Jiuwu definitely would have to bear some responsibility.

Thus, he offered no excuses, and directly admitted to his fault.

Rong Yang looked meaningfully at him, and did not continue to reprimand him.

As long as they were Heavenly Venerates, they were standing in the ranks at the peak, so how could they be easily insulted?

Though it was very easy for Heavenly Venerates to die now, there were just so many of them. One more dying meant the number would decrease by one, and who knew, maybe even the average number of Heavenly Venerates would actually be lower than the number of dimensions after another epoch.

If they wanted to conquer the world, every single Heavenly Venerate was an important source of battle prowess.

Rong Yang thought for a moment, and then said, “That Ling Han, is he the one that has repeatedly broken records in the past at the Realm Battlefield?”

“Yes,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate answered. By now, there was no need for him to hide anything; he only had to tell the truth. Of course, there was absolutely no way he would take the initiative to mention his old grudges with Ling Han.

“Able to match a Third Tier when he himself is only a First Tier? This is truly shocking; even if it was Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian, have they been able to do the same?” Rong Yang murmured to himself. He shook his head. At the very least, it was definitely impossible for him to do so.

In fact, he could not even fight one that was a Tier higher than himself, because he had only condensed over 30 Powers of Dimension. He was indeed stronger than Heavenly Venerates of the same level, but his strength was still limited.

“Producing three freaks from the same clan? Hehe, I truly would like to take a look for myself.” He finally stood. Whatever the case, there was no way Rong Xinkuan could die for nothing. The Ling Clan had to give Rong Yang an explanation, and give the Rong Clan an explanation.

Because the Rong Clan could not afford such humiliation.

“Lead the way,” he said.

“Yes,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate said, his head bowed, a sliver of a smile appearing at the corners of his lips. He had sacrificed his pride, almost becoming a dog for Rong Xinkuan, and it was finally time for him to reap his rewards.

“Lord Rong!” However, the two of them had not even stepped outside when a servant of the Lin Clan entered, and bowed to Rong Yang. “My master requests Lord Rong to meet him.”

Rong Yang couldn’t help but falter. This so-called “master” was naturally Lin Xiaoyang.

Previously, Lin Xiaoyang had been in seclusion all this while, and had not managed to take out time to grant him an audience. However, a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate was qualified to make Rong Yang wait, but the latter was not worthy to have a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate wait for him, allowing him to settle his own matters first.

Hence, after faltering momentarily, he nodded. “Please lead the way.”

In any case, the Ling Clan would not be moving, so there was no rush.

Rong Yang first went to meet Lin Xiaoyang, but he had not expected that Lin Xiaoyang would actually talk with him for three days and three nights, confirming some details of their cooperation, and only then was he allowed to leave.

Once he returned to his quarters, Rong Yang summoned Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and they charged towards Ling City.

He knew that Ling City was a secondary city of the Lin Clan, but he did not care.

…Compared with the alliance with the Ling Clan, what was a mere Third-Tier battle prowess worth? He was sure that even if he eliminated every single person in the Ling Clan, Lin Xiaoyang would only reprimand him with a few words at most.

In just a short while, the two great Heavenly Venerates arrived at Ling City.

In comparison, Rong Yang was much more domineering. He directly released the aura belonging to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, which enshrouded the entire Ling City.

However, what made him gloomy was that though everyone in Ling City was trembling under the suppression of his aura, not one of them actually panicked too much.

F*ck, what was going on here?

What he did not know was that Zhang Kailun had repeatedly come to Ling City to challenge Ling Han, so this Heavenly-Venerable-Tier aura was really nothing much for the people of Ling City. Though even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was not capable of bearing the aura of a Heavenly Venerate, while they physically could not bear it, they were indeed mentally used to it.

Rong Yang couldn’t be bothered to think too deeply about the reason behind this. He did not care.

“Ling Han, come out and see me!” he demanded.

“Scram!” Only this voice rang out from within the city.

It was the tsundere Empress.

“Hehe, those that dare to say this to me either have not been born yet, or are already dead!” Rong Yang sneered, and moved directly, his hand moving to enshrouding the whole Ling City.

Weng, a delicate hand stretched out, instantly turning into a colossal palm that covered the skies, meeting his incoming strike.

Boom!

...

The two giant hands clashed together, and the delicate hand immediately shattered. Rong Yang’s giant hand descended, continuing to press down on Ling City.

Weng, weng, weng! One after another, giant hands or clawed hands were launched from within the city in response to Rong Yang’s giant hand.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! These attacks were like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, immediately crumbling when they collided with Rong Yang’s giant hand. However, the number of these attacks was impressive. When Rong Yang’s giant hand finally landed, the destruction caused was also very limited.

Boom! The entire city was trembling wildly, and large numbers of buildings collapsed, but it did not cause a very great scale of destruction.

After all, the Empress’s first attack had already dispersed at least 30% of the force behind Rong Yang’s strike.

“En?” Rong Yang was surprised. He had not imagined that there would actually be so many Heavenly Venerates within Ling City.

But it was fine; even the strongest elite among these Heavenly Venerates was only a Third Tier.
