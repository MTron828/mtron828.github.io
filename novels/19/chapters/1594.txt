Chapter 1595: Han Qi

It was a young man, acting as if there was no one else there. He behaved as if this Celestial Flower was already his.

Yet Ling Han was shocked.

The speaker might have spoken unconsciously, but it sparked an interest in the listener.

The Void Flower was a Celestial variety, and only those from the Celestial Realm would know its exact name—even in the Forbidden Lands there should be very, very few people that knew it. This kind of Celestial Flower was too rare. So many years had passed; would there still be information about it left in the records of the Forbidden Lands?

This person originated from the Celestial Realm!

This was a more possible deduction, but this person was clearly only in the Genesis Tier, yet could come from the Celestial Realm, which meant that there had to be a powerful force backing him. Otherwise, he could not have possibly come here.

However, why had someone from the Celestial Realm come here?

Ling Han had once possessed the power of the true consummate level of the Genesis Tier, so he could clearly sense that this young man was not a Demon Master, nor was he a Saint. Instead, he was both—a true Genesis Tier.

A considerable number of Demon Masters turned to look at that young man. This person was very arrogant, behaving as if there was no one else here, but he was also very young. Being able to become a Demon Master at this age was extremely extraordinary.

This young man swept an eye over the masses, and did not speak, but there was a strong contempt in his eyes. That kind of superiority far surpassed even those from the Forbidden Lands, which allowed Ling Han to completely confirm that he had definitely come from the Celestial Realm.

“Hoho, even a bunch of trash dares to compete with me over a Celestial item?” The young man shook his head, showing a grin. “My name is Han Qi, and as for where I come from, you all are not qualified to know. You all only need to know that I am far above all of you, and should only be worshipped.

“Get lost immediately, or you all would be killed without mercy!”

He said the words that the Desolate Clouds Demon Master had said before, yet this time, the Desolate Clouds Demon Master also became a target of disdain, which caused this Black Demon to involuntarily humph coldly.

But there was space separating them. Even if there was seemingly just a gap of a few hundred meters between them, it was possible that the actual distance could be several billion miles. Even if he made a move, he would not be able to wound the other.

Just wait and see!

Everyone was saying the same line internally. They naturally would not take such a young man seriously, and thought that even if the latter had advanced into the Genesis Tier, he should only be a Yellow Demon at most.

They all advanced forwards, heading towards that Void Flower.

Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing, too, stepped out of the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. Speed was not a problem here, so there was no longer any need for the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. On the other hand, if they were in a Flight God Tool, it would affect the spreading of their divine sense.

In the instant the Empress appeared, even the dark universe seemed to have brightened considerably. Everyone couldn’t help but be drawn by the Empress’s extraordinary beauty and incomparable grace, without exceptions.

Han Qi, too, could not help taking a few looks. He withdrew his gaze, but then looked at her again, his face revealing a stunned expression.

Such extraordinary beauty was the first he had seen in his life!

His heart throbbed wildly, and he made his decision as well. This kind of beautiful woman should belong to him.

He had obtained a Celestial medicine as well as an exceptional beauty. Haha, he had initially thought the clan sending him out to this primitive land for a training trip was a tough task, but had not thought it would lead to him having such great fortune.

The Void Celestial Flower was incredibly valuable even in the Celestial Realm, and he probably would not be able to find another that could match such a beauty even in the Celestial Realm.

Everyone was trying their best to advance, but in front of this bizarre space, not one person really managed to stand out from the rest. Even Celestial level was not able to advance forwards, so there naturally was none that had any kind of advantage.

It was clear that there was only about a mile of distance left, which could easily be breached with a casual step, but another four days later, they had only advanced about 300 meters. The closer they were to the Void Flower, the more the space here overlapped.

Yet, after another 300 meters, everyone felt their divine sense relax. There was no longer a feeling of being restricted or awkwardness.

The space had returned to normal!

The Void Flower swayed gently. It clearly did not release any kind of smell, but everyone felt as if they smelt a fragrance that seeped into their noses, relaxing both their hearts and spirits. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Just anyone thinks he can come here!” A Demon Master swept an eye over Ling Han and the Empress, the corner of his lips expressing contempt. However, he then said, “You two just wait on the sidelines and watch; I will be able to guarantee your safety!”

He had been attracted by the Empress’s exceptional grace. Thus, he had said such words. Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible for him to be such a busybody.

The other Demon Masters only smiled faintly, and did not say much else. The Empress’s beauty made their hearts that they had long sealed away, and in which only remained the desire to pursue the apex of cultivation, restless. Even if they had not said the words that that Demon Master had said, they, too, would be careful when they moved. They would definitely avoid wounding her.

Yet Han Qi’s face was filled with disdain, and he exclaimed, “All of you, scram. You’re just mere ruffians, and you all dare to compete with me over an opportunity!”

“Young man, you are too arrogant!” the Desolate Clouds Demon Master rebuked coldly.

“You are courting death!” Han Qi tapped out a finger. There was no earth-shattering scene. Instead, only a blood-colored light flew out, yet its speed was quick to the extreme. It had just been shot out when it already arrived in front of the Desolate Clouds Demon Master.

Pu, the bloody light directly penetrated the Desolate Clouds Demon Master’s forehead, and then flew out from the back of his head. A spurt of blood sprayed out, and the eyes of this Demon Master immediately dimmed, his vitality dispersing.

There was no gravity in space. He still maintained his standing posture, yet his limbs were weakly drooping down.

An air of grief diffused in the heaven and earth, and rain of droplets of blood streamed, feeling pity for the passing of a Demon Master.

Everyone was startled at first, which was followed by great shock.

That was a Black Demon, and he had actually been insta-killed by a ridiculously young man. This was like the stuff of dreams, causing them to all doubt their eyes. Had they fallen into an illusion?

“I told you guys to scram, and you didn’t, then don’t blame me for starting a massacre!” Han Qi stated coldly. Hong, he released his own aura without reservation. It was indescribably terrifying like a landslide or a tsunami.

“H-H-H-H-Heaven Demon!” a Demon Master uttered in a trembling voice, filled with fear.

Initially, even Yellow Demons needed not fear a Heaven Demon too much, because everyone’s speed was about the same. Even if I was no match for you, I would still be able to flee, right? And if you pushed me too far, I would target your descendants, friends, and disciples. Even a Heaven Demon would feel much of a headache.

Thus, unless they were determined to kill the other, even Heaven Demons would give some face to Yellow Demons. After all, they were all mighty figures that stood at the Genesis Tier.

But the situation now was different.

The space here overlapped, and coming here would already take a lot of time. If they returned, it would take a similar amount of time, which was enough to allow a Heaven Demon to calmly and easily kill them over a few hundred times.

This was a state of utter despair!

A few people focused on the Void Flower. They believed that the overlapping of space here was because of this strange flower. If they could pluck this flower, the space should return to normal. Then, they would be able to break into a run and flee. They were sure that even a Heaven Demon could not possibly catch up to them.

“Hoho, just give up such unnecessary delusions!” Han Qi laughed loudly. A white-colored mist surged out from him, instantly enshrouding the entire area.

Everyone suddenly felt as if some spell had been placed on their bodies. They couldn’t even move a single finger.

They were done for!
