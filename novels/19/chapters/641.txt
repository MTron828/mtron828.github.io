Chapter 642: Entering the Zone of Thunder

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“How impressive?” Zhu Xuan Er asked.

Ling Han thought for a moment, then said seriously, “There are differences in strength for even spirits developed by the world. To rank Thunder Spirits in terms of power, Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder could be ranked amongst the top ten, so it’s very powerful.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Then how would the big rock man and Strange Fire be ranked?” Zhu Xuan Er was curious. Only when there was something to compare against would there be a clearer understanding.

Ling Han made a rough comparison, and said, “Small Rock, at most, can be ranked in the top hundred, and Strange Fire couldn’t even be counted in the top hundred before, but after... being refined, it should be able to rank in the top hundred.”

Only now did Zhu Xuan Er’s expression change. Merely those being ranked in the top hundred had such great power, so how powerful would a spirit ranked in the top ten be?

Just like the Prodigy Roll of the north region. At that time, being in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier would qualify one to be ranked in the top hundred, but what kind of existence would the top ten be? The Spiritual Pedestal Tier! There was no small gap between the two.

Looking at it this way, this Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder would be very terrifying.

Ling Han looked closely, and said, “The uncontrolled appearance of lightning is proof that the Thunder Cloud is about to appear. If it really became something that possesses intelligence, I fear no one would be able to obtain it.”

Putting aside how terrifying the battle prowess this Thunder Spirit would have, merely in terms of speed, how many people could catch up to it?

Ling Han was only in the Flower Blossom Tier, but his speed was enough to be on par with the Deity Transformation Tier. A Thunder Spirit had a body purely made out of thunder, so how fast could it be? Perhaps only if a Shattering Void Tier ultimate elite cultivator moved would it be caught.

‘Hold on!’

Ling Han paused. Those years ago, the Zi Xue Xian was definitely in the Shattering Void Tier, so could this Thunder Spirit actually have been caught by her? It had been suppressed here all this while, and after these ten thousand years had passed, the strength of its fetters had weakened, and coupled with the environmental changes incited by the earthquake, the restrictions weakened further. Finally, the Thunder Spirit managed to escape, and began the last step of its metamorphosis?

This place... could it really be the Boundless Mountains from years ago?

Ling Han was moved. He was yet unable to transform into lightning, but if he could refine the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder, he would definitely be able to reach major achievement in his cultivation of the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven—no matter what, he would at least reach minor achievement level, and he would have truly learnt it, and not be half-assed like it was now.

He was so excited that even his whole body was trembling. By that time, how terrifying would his battle prowess be? By then, he’d probably completely be able to battle an enemy on a whole cultivation tier higher than himself. He, a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator, could fight on equal footing with an opponent in the Deity Transformation Tier; that really sounded like something out of a myth.

“I am only one step away from Body of Diamond, and also one step away from thirty flashes of Qi. If I really could obtain this Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder and refine it, who knows, I might be able to reach Body of Diamond and form thirty flashes of Qi. At that time, I would be able to condense a Ray, birth a Spiritual Infant, and thunder and lightning would temper my physical body—all in one go. Thus, once I break through to Spiritual Infant Tier, I should be able to battle on equal footing against the strongest Deity Transformation Tier cultivators.”

This was really inconceivable. If one could battle an opponent five Battle Stars stronger than himself, he would be considered a super-genius, and those that could battle with a power gap of ten Stars would be nature-defying ultra-geniuses the likes of the Sword Emperor and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. But if Ling Han released his full power, he would be able to fight someone twenty Stars stronger than himself!

Of course, this took into account the three Mystical Powers, the Demon Birth Sword, the Mysterious Three Thousand technique, and the Indestructible Heaven Scroll. If he excluded any of these trump cards, that would mean that his battle prowess would drop a few Stars. However, if he really managed to fuse with this Strange Thunder, he could possess more than twenty Stars of battle prowess with merely the three Mystical Powers and fighting bare-handed.

“En, that would be enough to suppress the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, that fierce woman!” Ling Han mumbled. No matter what, he was a chauvinistic male, so he would definitely not resign himself to being suppressed by the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

“Still, I don’t know what level this fierce woman currently is. Even if she is the lowest level immortal, I’m afraid that she could still suppress me with a single finger.

“Ai, the path to suppressing the fierce woman is long, and I still have to search everywhere for a means.”

Ling Han was absent-minded for a while, then snapped his fingers, and said, “Xuan Er, you should stay here.”

Zhu Xuan Er understood, and nodded. She pretended to want to say something quiet to Ling Han, and pulled him into the forest. When Ling Han extended his divine sense to take her into the Black Tower, she planted a kiss on Ling Han’s cheek first before entering into the Black Tower.

“This girl!” Ling Han shook his head. He had occasionally spoken of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to Zhu Xuan Er, and most likely, his momentary absent-mindedness previously had been accurately interpretted by the latter that he had been missing the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

Zhu Xuan Er was clever in how she was obviously jealous, yet treated Ling Han even more tenderly than before, so Ling Han too would remember her closely in his heart.

‘Women truly are transformed from demons. At any place or time, they desire to steal your heart,’ Ling Han mused as he walked out of the forest.

Hu Niu placed her hands at her hips, and declared with utmost seriousness, “Niu not transformed from demon!”

Ling Han could not help but laugh loudly. Then, he turned to look at Rabbit, and said, “Hoodlum Rabbit, in front of us, the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder is about to appear, and the power of lightning is incredibly dangerous; do you still intend to follow? If you die, I can only plant the two stalks of Dragon’s Blood Overlord Ginseng in front of your grave next year.”

“Go away. Lord Rabbit is going to have a life as long as a hundred years, and definitely is no short-lived rabbit.” Rabbit flexed its tiny paws.

“Haven’t you already lived a few hundred years?” Hu Niu said curiously. “That’s a very long life.”

Rabbit was dejected, and replied, “Lord Rabbit misspoke. Can’t I live as long as ten thousand years?”

“Then take responsibility for your own life, and it’s your own responsibility whatever the consequences,” Ling Han said, smiling. He and Hu Niu had already learnt the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, and so had a close affinity with power of lightning. Compared to any other, they were better able to withstand the power of lightning.

Furthermore, worse come to worst, didn’t he still have the Black Tower as a backup plan?

Rabbit was disdainful. Didn’t they know that the characteristic trait of rabbits was that they could flee very fast? In flight, if Lord Rabbit admitted to be second place, what person would dare to claim to be first?

The two people and one rabbit advanced. The power of lightning had enshrouded the whole peak. The purple-colored lightning was incredibly terrifying. It would scatter everywhere, and upon striking the trees or the mountain rocks, without an exception, they were all reduced to ash.

Ling Han stretched out a finger, and zi, absorbed the power of lightning that had overflowed. The Five Elements Mix Chaos Lotus moved and its stalk shone, guiding the power of lightning to traverse throughout Ling Han’s body, allowing his physique to take one step closer to transforming into a body of lightning.

This power of lightning was insignificant, so it was naturally extremely slow to transform it, but Ling Han did not mind in the slightest. At most, this could only be considered an appetizer, whereas the main course was the Heaven Cloud Purple Thunder. As long as it had not completely transformed into a Thunder Spirit, it could be devoured. But if it succeeded to transform into a Spirit, he had best flee.

Hu Niu was even more of a monster than Ling Han. She already had a body of lightning, and the power of lightning actually scrambled to enter into her body, which caused her to giggle uncontrollably as if she was being tickled.

Really, different people had different lives. He had obviously also cultivated the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, so why was there such a tremendous gap between the two of them?

Ling Han sighed, and was very envious of Hu Niu.

“Don’t be envious. This girl’s ancestor is definitely a supreme elite from the realm of immortals. Even Lord Rabbit has to admit defeat in front of her bloodline inheritance and astonishing powers!” Rabbit said from the side.

Ling Han gave an “oh”, and said, “You think that Hu Niu’s ancestor is some supreme elite from the realm of immortals?”

“What else could be the case? Just tell Lord Rabbit, how else could a kid of seven or eight reach the Flower Blossom Tier?” Rabbit said in a tone of certainty.

Ling Han picked Rabbit up, and said, “It seems that you have much of an understanding about the realm of immortals. So tell me, how many different levels are immortals divided into?”
