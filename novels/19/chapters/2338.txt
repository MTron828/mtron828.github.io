Chapter 2339 Heavenly Venerate Tribulation

Ling Han had clearly grasped the theoretical knowledge already, and he also possessed the right tools as well as a medium such as the Origin Magic Cube. However, Ling Han was still unable to extract any energy from the unopenable scroll.

‘My cultivation level is too low,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

Even though the power of Regulations was reliant on heaven and earth, rendering their level of existence limited, they could also be regarded as the embodiment of heaven and earth. If one fully comprehended the Regulations, they could naturally glimpse the foundation of heaven and earth with more ease.

Thus, Heavenly Venerates all ascended as Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. No one could ascend from the Severing Mundane Tier to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Ling Han also understood that he couldn’t chew off more than he could bite. Right now, he simply wanted to grasp a sliver of heaven and earth’s fundamental power.

He was confident that this was possible. Otherwise, the Dark Inverse Realm wouldn’t have deployed Wally into the Foreign Realm, using him to mess with the core of this enemy realm. However, Wally had been attacked before he could even carry out this mission, so he had remained in a state of hibernation for a very long time.

Ling Han would cultivate under the Reincarnation Tree at times, and he would also run over to attempt to absorb energy from the unopenable scroll at times. He was as busy as could be.

On the sixth day, he decided to give things a rest. He needed to participate in the round of 32. However, by some fluke, and just as he was about to finish up, a formidable and paramount power suddenly entered his body. This was a profoundly ancient and primordial power. It was brimming with a “primal” and “pure” aura.

Rumble!

Thunder suddenly roared across heaven and earth. Dark clouds rolled over, dense and thick in layers. A paramount tribulation was forming!

“Not good! Someone’s about to face a tribulation!”

“Heavens! This is an Ancestral King Tribulation!”

“It’s not an ordinary Ancestral King Tribulation, either. It’s a supreme Eighteenth Lotus Tribulation!”

“No, I feel like even Eighteenth Lotus Tribulations aren’t this terrifying…”

“I think it’s a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation!”

Everyone exclaimed in shock. There was a sea of thunderclouds overhead, with terrifying arcs of lightning transforming into giants that could break through the clouds at any time and deal a fatal strike.

Ling Han was also stupefied. This was indeed a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation. When a Heavenly Venerate appeared, heaven and earth would turn to target them. For example, when the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable appeared, they would definitely be accompanied by a deluge of terrifying thunder and lightning. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be easily killed by such tribulation.

This tribulation was targeting him!

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. A cold chill gripped at his heart, and his premonition of danger was so intense that his entire brain hurt.

But why was this? He hadn’t ascended to the Heavenly Venerable Tier!

‘Hang on!’

He suddenly regained his senses. Hadn’t a mysterious and profound power just entered his body?

‘This is… Void Particle Energy!’

This was a magnificent type of energy that only Heavenly Venerates could wield. Now, however, he had succeeded in extracting some. Thus, heaven and earth treated him as a newly ascended Heavenly Venerate. It was also because of this that it unleashed a tribulation to erase his existence.

Indeed, the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm were at a higher level. Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t be targeted when they appeared. However, this didn’t mean that heaven and earth wouldn’t unleash a tribulation when someone advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If Ling Han had genuinely become a Heavenly Venerate, he could’ve naturally dealt with this situation. However, he had only extracted a sliver of Void Particle Energy, so how could he possibly rival tens of thousands of lightning giants at the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier?

He hurriedly eased his mind, dispersing the Void Particle Energy that had entered his body.

Rumble…

Thunder continued to roar, and lightning continued to crackle. However, heavenly tribulation didn’t descend.

Everyone was shaking in fear. This was a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation! To say nothing of targeting them, even if they were just scraped by this tribulation, even Fifteenth Lotus and Sixteenth Lotus Ancestral Kings would suffer immensely. Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral Kings wouldn’t be able to block it, either. Only Heavenly Venerates could face such a tribulation. Thus, if this tribulation descended, no one here would make it out alive.

One had to realize that the Thousand Academy Tournament was still being held. It could be said that all of the prodigies at or above the Eighth Lotus were in attendance. If they were all killed, the foundation of the Foreign Realm would genuinely be wounded for at least several epochs.

Fortunately, the thunderclouds didn’t become more violent. Instead, they slowly dispersed, ultimately vanishing altogether. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. They felt like they had escaped from the jaws of death. Meanwhile, the Ancestral King of the Four Splendor Academy immediately started to investigate the situation. Why had a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation suddenly appeared?

Perhaps some heaven-defying treasure was about to appear?

This was the most popular explanation. After all, no one believed that a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate existed among them. They all started to scour the Four Splendor Academy. Wherever one looked, one could see people walking around with their hands clasped behind their back, acting as if they were enjoying the flowers. However, when no one was paying attention, they would start to furiously search the surroundings.

It was amid this kind of atmosphere that the round of 32 was completed. However, it was as if this tournament had lost all of its appeal, with the number of spectators dropping by a whopping fivefold.

Ling Han could only poke his tongue out in secret. If they learned that he was the cause of this, just how severely would he be pummeled? Of course, even more people would covet his ability to trigger a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation.

‘Hang on! How did I manage to extract the Void Particle Energy?’

Ling Han massaged his head in thought. He had made so many failed attempts before, so how had he suddenly fluked into success? He was completely unable to recall the process.

“F*ck! How the hell did I succeed?” He mulled over this for a long time, yet he couldn’t recall anything at all. His eyes were bloodshot, and it was as if he were a mortal who hadn’t slept for several days.

“In any case, this Void Particle Energy is seriously terrifying.”

Apart from triggering a heavenly tribulation, channeling the Void Particle Energy for just a brief moment had also reconstructed every single cell in his body, elevating their level.

‘My physique is definitely more powerful than before. Moreover, my power has also risen significantly. However, this kind of power is completely different from the brute power I possessed before.’ Ling Han’s power had advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier long ago. However, his brute power had been useless in terms of increasing his lethality. It could only increase the speed and frequency of his attacks. Although this was indeed useful in battle, it was clearly less powerful than advancing his grasp of Regulations to the Ascending Origin Tier. The gulf between them was immense.

After all, Regulations were the true weapons of cultivators. Without a solid foundation of Regulations, one would be analogous to a powerful brute using a thin sheet of paper to slap someone. So what if they were immensely powerful? Could their slaps hurt?

Now, however, things were different. After absorbing the Void Particle Energy, it was as if his power had been fitted with deadly weapons. He could unleash deadly attacks even without using the power of Regulations.

Could the power of heaven and earth not be freakish?

Even though it was only a wisp.

“If I can continuously absorb Void Particle Energy to elevate my physique, will I be able to elevate my physique to a paramount level? At that time, can my physique advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, allowing me to ignore the Heavenly Venerate Tribulation?” Ling Han murmured. His heart thumped in excitement.

“Damn it! How in the world did I extract that wisp of energy?”

Ling Han continued to mull over this as he stepped onto the arena. He was thinking so hard that he wanted to bang his head against a wall.

Meanwhile, standing opposite him, Sen Ping couldn’t help but wear a dark expression.

He conceded that Ling Han was indeed profoundly powerful. This was evident from his status as a seed. However, he didn’t need to be so arrogant and haughty, did he? Sen Ping had clasped his hands in respect, yet Ling Han hadn’t even returned the gesture? Not only that, but he was even furrowing his brows and scratching his cheeks? What was the meaning of this?!

‘Are you belittling me?’

In the past, it was You Yuan. Now, it was Ling Han. The Hundred Battles Academy was taking things too far!

“You’re taking things too far!” he roared in rage. He charged forward, with his aura rising like smoke. He was going to fight for his honor.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Ling Han instinctively counterattacked, not drawing on any power of Regulations. However, he was able to easily rival Sen Ping.
