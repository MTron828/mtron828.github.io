Chapter 1135: There’s Always Someone Stronger

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You’re quite courageous, huh? You even dare to kill someone from the Majestic Heaven Sect!” Zhang Tong said in a baleful voice.

Ling Han shook his head while laughing loudly, and said, “Wrong! You’re merely a lackey, and the people I killed were lapdogs of a lackey! So, what does this have to do with the Majestic Heaven Sect?”

Zhang Tong faltered for a moment. Just then, it was his lackey who had said that the five of them weren’t from the Majestic Heaven Sect. That being the case, the rules of the Majestic Heaven Sect naturally didn’t apply to them. As such, what did it matter if they killed others?

Now, however, Ling Han was using the words of his own lackey against him. It was just that Ling Han was far too unvirtuous. Every sentence he spoke was filled with the words “lackey” and “lapdog”.

He stared at Ling Han, and said, “You’re correct. If one is powerful enough, they can naturally do as they wish. However, if I decide to act, how many strikes of mine do you think you can block?”

“Oh? Are you very powerful?” Ling Han picked his ears. He appeared as relaxed as he could be.

Zhang Tong humphed, and said, “I’m at the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier, and my power can surpass five stars. My battle prowess... can surpass seven stars!”

“What?!”

The surrounding onlookers clasped their heads in shock.

Was this even possible?

Even five-star geniuses only existed in the legends. Yet, Zhang Tong claimed that just his power alone could already surpass five stars. His battle prowess was even more insane, and was able to surpass a whopping seven stars! If this were true, why was he still a follower? He was definitely talented enough to become a seed!

However, Ling Han knew that cultivation was like rowing a boat upstream—it would float backward if it didn’t advance. Perhaps Zhang Tong possessed a power of five stars at the moment. However, there was no guarantee that he would be able to maintain this power of five stars after advancing to the Sun Moon Tier. Perhaps his power would fall to four stars, or maybe even three stars.

This was similar to how Ling Han had formed five Mountains and Rivers and could attain a pinnacle power of 10 stars. If he didn’t form five Suns and Moons after advancing to the Sun Moon Tier, his power would end up falling to nine or even eight stars.

If he were only able to form four heavenly bodies at the Heavenly Body Tier, his power would continue to fall, perhaps going down to seven or even six stars.

Thus, the number of stars that one could surpass wasn’t set in stone. Moreover, the higher one’s cultivation level was, the harder it would be to maintain a high number of stars. This was because keeping the same number of stars would require one to cultivate to an extremely high level in each major tier.

“A power of five stars?” Ling Han said with a faint smile. A power of five stars was indeed very powerful. However, he had already possessed a power of six stars before forming five Mountains and Rivers. Right now, his power was at an astonishing seven stars.

Although there was only a difference of one star, there was a huge leap in quality going from the sixth to seventh star. This qualitative change could only be achieved if one formed five Mountains and Rivers. This was similar to how the last three stars in the Shattering Void Tier could only be bestowed by heaven and earth.

“Are you afraid now?” Zhang Tong chuckled coldly, and said, “Kneel down and kowtow to me, and pledge yourself to me as your master. In light of the fact that cultivation is not easy, I’ll take pity on you and accept you as my servant.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You’re too full of yourself! Fine, you can attack me now. I’m done speaking nonsense with trash such as yourself. I need to dispose of you quickly lest you delay my proper matters.”

Pu!

The onlookers almost spat their tongues out in astonishment. ‘You’re already in such a perilous situation, yet you’re still running your mouth?

‘That’s a seven-star genius! He’s basically invincible in the Mountain River Tier! Although such a prodigy is only a follower... just how prodigious is Yang Hao? Is he an eight-star genius? Or perhaps a nine-star genius? 10-star genius?!’

“You’re seeking death!!” Zhang Tong finally couldn’t hold back anymore. He raised his right hand and lashed out at Ling Han.

He had only thrown this strike casually as he was far too confident in himself. He was sure that this strike would end everything.

Ling Han simply snapped his fingers again.

Xiu!

A burst of sword light surged outward, so dazzling that it illuminated the heavens

“Aaaah!” Zhang Tong clasped his hand as he retreated. Blood dripped from his fingers and pitter-pattered onto the ground.

The onlookers almost spat their tongues out again. They were completely lost for words.

Zhang Tong was a seven-star genius, one that had reached the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier, no less. Yet, he had actually been wounded by a simple snap of that person’s fingers. How could they accept this?

“Y-you!” Zhang Tong was stunned.

He raised his right hand, only to see that a hole had been made in it. The sight of this bloody hole sent a harrowing chill through his body.

Although his strike had only been casual, Ling Han’s strike had also been similarly casual. No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t seem like his opponent had used any secret technique. However, the might of his opponent’s strike had been far above that of his.

‘How can such a frightening prodigy appear on such a day?

‘Haven’t the top prodigies already been accepted into the sect?’

Zhang Tong was indeed arrogant and domineering, but was he brainless? Of course not!

He had been certain that no super genius would appear today, and as such, it was his chance to act haughty and domineering. One had to remember that he had once been a key disciple. Moreover, he was already at the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier. It could be said that even many of the seeds were no match for him—the difference in their cultivation level was too large, after all.

However, he had come across a powerful opponent now.

“‘You’ what? Haven’t you learned your lesson yet?” Ling Han’s voice was cold, and he continued, “In fact, there’s no need for you to learn any lesson, because you won’t live to see the future!”

“Bullsh*t!” Zhang Tong roared loudly as he slapped his chest. A soft green glow appeared, and a small green cauldron appeared within the light. However, this green cauldron immediately started to spin and grow larger, eventually transforming into a giant cauldron that measured 30 meters in height.

“Suppress him!” Zhang Tong roared. Tens of thousands of green aura strands instantly flowed down from the green cauldron and surged toward Ling Han.

Each strand of green aura transformed into a large snake that weighed as much as a mountain. They hadn’t reached Ling Han yet, but the indescribable might that they exuded was already causing the land to tremor.

This was a remarkable God Tool.

“Emerald Cliff Cauldron!” someone exclaimed. “T-this is Yang Hao’s supreme treasure! He actually bestowed it upon Zhang Tong?”

“What?! Emerald Cliff Cauldron? That’s a Sun Moon Tier God Tool! It’s rumored to be a Level Eight God Tool, and it ranks highly even when compared to other Sun Moon Tier God Tools!”

“No, that isn’t the Emerald Cliff Cauldron. It’s only a replica. Otherwise, would we still be able to stand here and spectate the battle?”

“You’re right. If it were the genuine Emerald Cliff Cauldron, just a strand of its aura would be enough to suppress all of us.”

“Even if it’s only a replica, it’s still extremely terrifying. It can probably rank among the top few Mountain River Tier God Tools.”

“Mm-hm. Can’t you see that Zhang Tong is even using his precious blood to nurture it? This means that he can’t control it using his own raw power. He has to feed it his blood, and as such allow the God Tool to become a part of him. Only by doing so can he use this God Tool.”

“That person... is going to suffer!”

Boom! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The large snakes surged down with the green light, and it was as if countless great stars were crashing down from the sky. The ground continued to shake violently, and the commotion that it caused was petrifying.

Zhang Tong smiled coldly. That brat was indeed powerful—he had actually forced him to activate the replica Emerald Cliff Cauldron. However, everything was about to end. What Mountain River Tier cultivator would be able to stand up against the combined power of him and the replica Emerald Cliff Cauldron?

“What?!”

His expression changed drastically in the next instant. This was because his replica Emerald Cliff Cauldron was shaking in exertion.

‘This... Even this can’t suppress that brat?’

Peng!

The green aura shot upward, revealing Ling Han’s fist that was still surging toward the sky. The gigantic green cauldron swayed dangerously, and no more green aura was able to flow down from its body.

“Wah!” Zhang Tong spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was linked to this replica Emerald Cliff Cauldron, meaning that he would also suffer a backlash should the cauldron be damaged. His body was burning, and he felt as if it were about to burst apart.

The onlookers were stunned.
