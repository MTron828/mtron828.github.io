3014 Defend

Gui Hou wore a calm and innocent smile.

He then seized this opportunity to counterattack.

Peng, peng, peng!

He launched a barrage of attacks, causing the two Dividing Soul Tier cultivators to appear extremely disheveled.

Most importantly, the two cultivators had never fought against an opponent like this before. Gui Hou didn’t need to channel his power to defend, and he simply needed to turn around and use the shield on his back. The thick shield would glow with veined patterns and transform into the most powerful defensive mechanism.

The two cultivators couldn’t breach Gui Hou’s defense.

Thus, this became an opportunity for Gui Hou to display his might, and he completely suppressed the two Dividing Soul Tier cultivators.

Ning Daolan’s expression involuntarily grew dark. The other elders of the Azure Sky Sect also felt extremely ticked off. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

If they stepped forward, they could crush Gui Hou’s defense with a single blow. The problem was, however, that there were so many guests present, so they had to be extremely careful of their status and actions. After all, was there no competent Dividing Soul Tier cultivator in the Azure Sky Sect?

The battle was intense, and this allowed Ning Haixin to recover a wisp of her senses. She could vaguely make out Gui Hou through the beaded veil hanging down from her crown, and a glimmer involuntarily appeared in her eyes. She couldn’t help but say, “Uncle Gui!”

Unexpectedly, Gui Hou was able to hear her exclamation as he fought. He grinned and turned around, saying, “Little Ning, Uncle Gui has come to rescue you!”

This was a lake spirit from the Heavenly Treasure Lake!

Gui Hou’s true form was that of a large turtle, and even after shifting to the form of a human, he still retained his thick shell. This was his most powerful defense.

‘They’ve… come to rescue me!’

Ning Haixin instantly felt the urge to burst into tears. What an ironic situation! Her closest family members were forcing her into misery and despair, while those who were completely unrelated to her were standing up to defend her…

However, she was an extremely kind person, so she was unwilling to see others risk their lives for her. She hurriedly said, “Uncle Gui, hurry up and leave!”

He was only at the Dividing Soul Tier, so he wouldn’t be able to make much of a splash in this place. Instead, he would only lose his life for nothing.

“Little Ning, Uncle Gui is only the vanguard. There are still others behind me,” he replied as he smiled.

Everyone was astonished upon hearing this. There were still reinforcements?

Strange… This was clearly the Azure Sky Sect, so how could they not react to such a large-scale intrusion?

This defense was far too weak, no?

However, the members of the Azure Sky Sect all exchanged glances before coming to a sudden realization.

Some of the elders more so knew that Ning Haixin had been close with the spirits in the lake from a very young age. If others entered the Heavenly Treasure Lake, they would definitely be torn to shreds and killed. However, Ning Haixin could freely boat around the lake.

To their surprise, however, Ning Haixin’s relationship with the lake spirits was actually this good, so much so that they were willing to step forward to defend her.

Ling Han watched on as he stood among the guests. As long as he wished, no one else in the crowd could see him.

Gui Hou naturally hadn’t been summoned by him. Ling Han hadn’t stuck his nose into someone else’s business, and he had simply come here on a whim. He would stroll around and take a look here and there, but he certainly wouldn’t interfere.

This woman was born with a mysterious aura of affinity, one which caused others to want to help her. Even Ling Han was slightly affected by this aura.

One had to realize that he was a Heavenly Venerate.

An aura that could affect even Heavenly Venerate… Just what kind of concept was this?

Ling Han was quite curious. Was this a type of physique? Or perhaps there was some kind of hidden secret in her body?

The Lu Clan was most likely trying to wed her into their clan because they were interested in this ability.

‘Interesting.’

“Mr. Gui, since you’re from the Heavenly Treasure Lake, you should know that we’ve signed an agreement!” Ning Xiuwei said as he ordered the two Dividing Soul Tier cultivators to retreat. His tone was far more respectful than before.

The Heavenly Treasure Lake was far too important to the Azure Sky Sect, so he had no option but to adjust his attitude.

Gui Hou laughed heartily, and said, “Of course I know about the agreement. However, it’s exactly because of this agreement that I need to take Little Ning with me.” He pointed at Ning Haixin, and continued, “She’s one of us!”

His loud proclamation caused the rims of Ning Haixin’s eyes to go red. Tears involuntarily rolled down her cheeks.

However, the others snickered coldly. Was this a joke? Ning Haixin was a member of the Ning Clan! Since when had she become a lake spirit from the Heavenly Treasure Lake?

“Utter nonsense!” Ning Xiuwei immediately retorted.

Gui Hou shot a sideways glance at Ning Xiuwei, and said disdainfully, “Little Ning has grown up drinking water from the Heavenly Treasure Lake, so if she can’t be regarded as a member of the Heavenly Treasure Lake, then perhaps you ugly bastard can?”

‘What kind of logic is this? Because she drank your water, she’s now one of you?’

Ning Xiuwei pointed at Gui Hou, and stammered, “Y-y-you…”

After stammering for half a day, he was still unable to offer any retort. Against such an unreasonable turtle, what else could he say?

Ning Xiuhong, Ning Haixin’s eldest brother, stepped forward, and said, “Mr. Gui, are you representing yourself? Or… are you representing the Heavenly Treasure Lake?”

The difference between the two was immense. If Gui Hou were representing himself, or a small number of spirits from the Heavenly Treasure Lake, then the Azure Sky Sect wouldn’t need to pay much heed to this. If he was representing the entire Heavenly Treasure Lake, however, then the problem would be much more serious.

Gui Hou chuckled, and said, “The members of the Heavenly Treasure Lake are naturally as united as can be.”

In other words, he was representing the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

Ning Xiuhong looked toward his father. This wasn’t something that he could call the shots for.

There was a white snake in the Heavenly Treasure Lake, and this snake had already transformed into a flood dragon long ago. It was extremely likely that it would advance again and evolve into a True Dragon. In other words, it’d evolve into a Celestial King.

However, the Heavenly Treasure Lake had signed an agreement with the Azure Sky Sect long ago, both agreeing not to attack each other. At the same time, the Heavenly Treasure Lake would also offer some Celestial medicines to the Azure Sky Sect each year, and this could be viewed as the price to pay for peace and prosperity.

For many years, both parties had coexisted in peace. The Azure Sky Sect did indeed want to tear up the agreement and obtain all of the treasures in the lake for themselves, but they didn’t dare to do so, because the white snake in the lake was far too powerful. Ning Daolan wasn’t confident that he could suppress it.

Now that they were allying with the Lu Clan, Ning Daolan wanted to ask Celestial King An Teng for help to suppress this white snake. At that time, the Heavenly Treasure Lake would genuinely become a treasured lake of the Azure Sky Sect.

‘Start the battle now?’

Even though the Azure Sky Sect had 11 Ascending Origin Tier elites, it was still extremely likely that both sides would suffer huge losses if they fought with the white snake now.

Ning Daolan humphed, and said, “I’m marrying off my own daughter, so do I need anyone else’s permission?”

Boom!

His Ascending Origin Tier aura exploded into the surroundings, causing everyone to feel stifled.

Gui Hou’s aura was also suppressed, and his face instantly became pale. Only after taking three or four breaths did he finally manage to regain his composure. He took a deep breath, and said, “Lord Ning, you’ve graced Little Ning with life and a good upbringing, and we’ve also watched her slowly grow up. We’re all close relatives.

“So, whether or not Little Ning wants to marry that bastard should be for her to decide.

“If she’s willing, then the Heavenly Treasure Lake won’t say another word. If she’s unwilling, however, then I’m sorry, but the members of the Heavenly Treasure Lake definitely won’t look the other way and allow our companion to be forced into misery!”

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this. The Heavenly Treasure Lake was genuinely going all out this time!

But… why?

Ning Haixin was just an ordinary girl at the Severing Mundane, so regardless of how beautiful she was, there was still no need for the Heavenly Treasure Lake to go so far for her, right?

At this moment, everyone looked at Ning Haixin, waiting for her to speak.
