Chapter 2468: Little Terror unleashes its might

When Ling Han’s words fell, both Zhu Zixi and Yang Gang immediately showed hints of anger and confusion in their expressions.

‘You guys only have a single Celestial King in your party, and it’s one that has just broken through recently at that, and you actually want to conquer a base? What do you think a base is? Is it something that you can conquer just by thinking about it?’

Even Third Heaven Celestial Kings had experienced multiple bloody battles before finally managing to take occupation of them.

Because when these towers appeared, they would be wrapped with various plants, which had great power. These needed to be cleared away before the tower could be occupied, and it was not something that could be done by one who was not a Third Heaven Celestial King.

‘And you guys want to take advantage of a Third Heaven Celestial King? Isn’t that just courting death?’

Bases could not be lost. Others might not know it, but Celestial Kings who had stayed here for a long time like them knew it very well. When midnight came, a mysterious light would shine from within the tower, allowing them a glimpse of supreme great dao, with a mysterious fragrance that would advance their cultivation levels. Though this would only last for a short while, it was still equivalent to the Celestial Kings cultivating earnestly for several million years.

And what was most important? This could help them break through, even!

Moreover, the more towers occupied, the stronger this light and fragrance would be, and this was the fundamental reason that the Celestial Kings had gathered into alliances together.

Why did they not simply choose to gather themselves all together into one group, then? To speak of nothing else, merely the joint forces of these Third Heaven Celestial Kings should be capable of sweeping aside everything else before them.

It was because this mysterious light and fragrance could only be shared among a limited number of people. Even if they occupied an extremely great number, it would only boost the effects of the light and fragrance, and could not increase the number of people that it could be shared among. Hence, a single team could only have a dozen to 20 Celestial Kings at most, or everyone would have to take turns.

Under this kind of prerequisite, everyone could only split ways and battle on their own, with a Third Heaven Celestial King gathering a great many Second Heaven and First Heaven Celestial Kings under his authority as their leader.

Additionally, the closer they were to the central area, the higher the grade of the towers was. Thus, only lower-tier Celestial Kings would be guarding the outer circles, while Third Heaven Celestial Kings would be fighting for those better towers.

But the closer to the central area, the smaller the territory became, and the number of towers was definitely decreasing as well. Hence, not only would they have to battle those mysterious plants, they also had to clash with powerful competitors. The fighting was extremely cruel, and the Third Heaven Celestial Kings could not free themselves to interfere in the battles that were going on behind the lines at all.

......

“Hehe, Grandmaster Ling is really such a joker.” Zhu Zixi hurriedly laughed, playing mediator.

Ling Han’s face bore a calm smile. Though his knowledge was limited, he definitely did not believe that Celestial Kings were sent out as guards just for the sake of a stepping stone or supply station, and this had even drawn the invasion of two other Celestial Kings.

There had to be some other reason.

Then things were simple. He only had to conquer one, and he could slowly study to find out the reason.

Wasn’t this place a place where power was the only rule? Weren’t the towers here conquered through battle?

“There are indeed times that I would joke, but this clearly is not one of them!” Ling Han swept an eye over, and said to Zhu Zixi, “As an outsider myself, I will give you a word of advice. Join our side and become my subordinate, how about it?”

Zhu Zixi’s expression instantly darkened. Though he had addressed Ling Han as grandmaster, that did not mean he really respected Ling Han all that much. He had only thought that he might have a need of Ling Han’s skill in alchemy in the future, and that was why he had been polite.

It should be known that Zhu Zixi was a Celestial King by now!

To speak of nothing else, weren’t the words “Celestial King” enough?

Not only did this Ling Han refuse his kindness, he actually wanted to recruit him as a lackey. Just how far would he go to humiliate him?

He declared menacingly, “I’m afraid I will have to disappoint Grandmaster Ling’s kind offer. I have no intentions of becoming anyone’s lackey!” He had broken through on his first trip into the Celestial Path, which showed that his natural talent was still extremely high. Then, his future accomplishments would not just be limited to First Heaven. In fact, he had hopes of reaching even Third Heaven and Fourth Heaven. How could he lower himself to become someone’s subordinate?

Ling Han sighed. This guy really thought that the former was insulting him?

It should be known that even monarch tiers like Yan Xianlu and Yi had willingly become his lackeys, and their future accomplishments would be becoming a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, at the very least.

Forget it. Ling Han had only spoken on a whim himself, and had not really wanted to get someone so “mediocre” as subordinate.

“Hehe, since Grandmaster Ling is so overbearing, why don’t we call a truce first, and eliminate Grandmaster Ling and his party?” Yang Gang suggested. These words were directed at Lu Ming, however.

“Sure.” Lu Ming nodded smilingly.

There was only a single Celestial King in Ling Han’s group. If the four great Celestial Kings joined forces against them, they would be able to very quickly suppress or chase them off so as to prevent Ling Han’s group from benefiting from the conflict between them.

This time, Zhu Zixi did not say anything. He thought that this was what Ling Han had asked for. A Five-Star Grandmaster was indeed very powerful in the Celestial Realm, but on the Celestial Path? Hehe.

The four great Celestial Kings immediately turned from enemies into allies. At the very least, they were completely on the same page regarding dealing with Ling Han and his group first.

Ling Han smiled, and tossed Little Terror out. “Go!”

The little guy had gotten impatient long ago, and had been baring its fangs. Now that it had gotten Ling Han’s permission, it immediately charged out in a flurry of its strong, broad legs, its mouth open, emanating a chilling aura.

The four Celestial Kings felt a chill rise up their backs at the same time, as if their opponent was not a tiny beast that was only two feet tall, but an extraordinary beast of the Ancient Age whose killing intent soared to the heavens, as if it was a killing machine.

They each made their move, wanting to stop Little Terror from coming closer.

But what was Little Terror?

A Battle Beast that the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm had deliberately created to deal with the Dark Inverse Realm. It was an existence that was even more terrifying than a War Soldier. Not only was its battle prowess that of a Monarch Star, no questions about it being able to sweep aside all peers, its defense was also incredibly tough. In fact, it could even be compared with the physique that Ling Han had formed through cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

The moment this kind of battle machine broke through to the Celestial King Tier, what would it mean?

Its Vitality Index would be as high as 4600 points, and its defense was something that would drive even a First Heaven Celestial King to despair.

Peng, peng, peng,?it directly ignored the attacks of the four great Celestial Kings. When they landed on it, only a series of dazzling sparks were created. They could not harm it in the slightest. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Little Terror charged towards them, opened its bloody, gaping mouth, and bit at Lu Ming.

Lu Ming hurriedly grabbed hold of great dao and whipped it outwards, yet Little Terror snapped it in half, and still determinedly directed a bite at his lower body.

It could not be helped; Little Terror was too short and tiny, so it could only aim at this position.

Lu Ming’s face was livid. If Little Terror bit off his ****, how would he still have the face to see others in the future?

Yang Gang and the other great Celestial Kings moved at the same time, blasting at Little Terror.

Peng, the combined forces of three great Celestial Kings still held some power, stopping Little Terror’s figure slightly, which allowed Lu Ming to escape this calamity.

Little Terror was enraged. This was its first battle since becoming a Celestial King, and it had actually not come out on top?

It charged out again, extremely vicious.

So what if the four great Celestial Kings joined forces? They could only escape in a panic, with Little Terror hot on their tails.

Ling Han nodded. Little Terror was truly a creaure that had been purposely created by a realm through a back door. It was extremely impressive, and was created for the sole purpose of battle. However, precisely because of that, it was very limited as well, as its intelligence was slightly low. Otherwise, if it could cultivate like Ling Han and the others, its battle prowess would definitely be even stronger.

Ling Han could not be too discontented. This kind of Little Terror was already very powerful.

As his thoughts wandered, the four great Celestial Kings were already scrambling all over the place with Little Terror pursuing them, and could no longer withstand it. Finally, they had no choice but to jump out of the window and flee.
