Chapter 2095: Eighth Heaven Celestial King

“Milady!”

“Milady!”

Including Lu Hairong and the Full Winds Celestial King, everyone knelt, paying their humblest respect to this Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

An Eighth Heaven Celestial King could kill a Fourth Heaven Celestial King several times over with a single thought.

“The fierce woman is here now. There’s a good show ahead.”

Meanwhile, the large black dog mumbled to himself, his figure suddenly becoming translucent. He was clearly still standing there, yet it was as if he had disappeared from the skies.

His grasp of the Regulations of Space had reached an astonishing height.

That Eighth Heaven Celestial King in the skies was naturally Celestial King Ling Miao. Her face was filled with fury, looking like it was strong enough to burn the heavens and boil the earth.

In her pursuit, she had confirmed that that despicable large black dog was just within the vicinity. Yet, the grasp over the Regulations of Space that this large black dog had had already reached a chilling extent. Even she was unable to capture any trace of him.

She ignored Lu Hairong and the others completely. Though they were all Celestial Kings, a Fourth Heaven Celestial King was actually no different than an ant in her eyes. Anyone who had not reached the height that she had would completely be unable to imagine just how strong she was.

“En?” Her eyes swept over them, stopping on the Full Winds Celestial King.

“Mi-Milady!” The Full Winds Celestial King involuntarily shivered. At this moment, he felt as if the sect master of the Dhara Sect was staring at him. That heavy, intimidating pressure made him feel like he was only a minor character that had not even begun cultivating.

“Where is that damn dog?” Ling Miao Celestial King spoke.

What damn dog?

The Full Winds Celestial King was baffled. This lady had come in such an aggressive manner, but the words she spoke were completely baffling. What madness was she in now?

However, Ling Han’s heart jolted.

There seemed to be only one damn dog that could enrage a Celestial King to the point of stomping in rage.

The large black dog!

At the time, he said that it was possible he would be targeted by several supreme existences, and thus left Ling Han while going off to steal the underpants of a female Celestial King on his way.

Linking that with the present situation and thinking further, the truth was practically on the verge of being disclosed.

This female Celestial King was the poor victim whose underpants had been stolen by the large black dog.

…A great and noble Celestial King, and one that was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King at that, actually had her underpants stolen?

Ling Han couldn’t help but be impressed with the large black dog. Just how strong had this guy gotten by now to actually be able to even bring disaster onto an Eighth Heaven Celestial King?

“Not talking?” Ling Miao Celestial King was clearly a hot-tempered person. She directly stretched out a hand, and green dragon claws appeared in thin air, gripping tightly around the Full Winds Celestial King. Seals of great dao surged, and supreme might abounded.

“Milady, I really don’t know what you are speaking of!” The Full Winds Celestial King was almost about to cry. He was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, for better or worse. Anyone who saw him would have to be extremely respectful, and address him “my lord”.

But now to be picked up in front of so many people, completely incapable of fighting back, this was an extraordinary humiliation.

Yet he did not dare to have the slightest complaint. Otherwise, if an Eighth Heaven Celestial King wanted to kill him, it would completely be the matter of a single thought. Afterwards, even if the Dhara Celestial King went to seek her out, it would still be a question of whether he would be able to match her.

He had no wish to die in such a dubious way.

Celestial King Ling Miao humped, while her other hand tapped out at empty air.?Pa, the clothes that the Full Winds Celestial King was wearing immediately exploded, and fluttered and danced in the skies like butterflies. However, a pink-colored pair of underpants was completely unscathed, and floated down slowly.

‘Huh?’

Everyone saw this scene clearly.

A great and noble Celestial King, and he had actually hidden the underpants of a woman on him. This taste… was really unique.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Could it be that the Full Winds Celestial King had an unusual fetish?

Celestial King Ling Miao’s fury blazed even hotter. With a sudden wave of her hand, this pair of pink underpants burned fiercely, but it did not look like it was going to burn up completely, at least for now.

Everyone was astonished. That was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, and even this kind of existence could not instantly burn this pair of underpants to ash. Just how shocking was the defense of these underpants?

They definitely did not belong to the Full Winds Celestial King.

Hold on, why was Celestial King Ling Miao only targeting the Full Winds Celestial King? There were a total of four Celestial Kings here, but Ling Miao Celestial King had only chosen the Full Winds Celestial King to make a move on out of all of them?

Could it be… that the Full Winds Celestial King had stolen Celestial King Ling Miao’s underpants? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Er, it could only be said that the Full Winds Celestial King’s hobbies were too unique, and that he was outrageously bold to actually dare to stretch out his hand towards an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, and he had even succeeded at that.

Impressive!

For a moment, everyone directed gazes of admiration at the Full Winds Celestial King. Even the Green Wolf Celestial King and Celestial King Yuanfang were no exception.

Yet the Full Winds Celestial King was completely dumbfounded. Why did he have a pair of female underpants on him? Furthermore, it was clear that this pair of underpants had brought great trouble to him. Seeing how lady Celestial King’s killing intent was surging, he hurriedly proclaimed, “Milady, this pair of underpants is not mine… No, no, no, it was not me who has stolen yours… No, no, no, I don’t know how it came to be in my possession, either.”

He was telling the complete truth, but who would believe him?

Oh, you were a Fourth Heaven Celestial King here. If you were not the one who stole it, how could it be that there would be another that could frame you? The only person who could accomplish that here would only be Celestial King Ling Miao, but would she do that?

You had to be joking.

“It really wasn’t me!” The Full Winds Celestial King wanted to cry by now. This had absolutely nothing to do with him, yet now he could not explain it clearly, no matter how hard he tried.

Indeed, even he himself was about to believe that he had done it. Otherwise, where would this pair of underpants have come from?

Pa, Celestial King Ling Miao raised a hand, and delivered a slap. Immediately, a bright red handprint appeared on Full Winds Celestial King’s face. “That damn dog… where exactly is he?!”

She naturally knew that the Full Winds Celestial King had not been the thief to steal the underpants, but he had to have some relation with the large black dog. Otherwise, how could that damn dog have possibly handed his spoils over to him?

“Milady, I don’t know anything about any damn dog. I am innocent,” the Full Winds Celestial King lamented plaintively, feeling so wronged and aggrieved.

With the pride of a Celestial King, he should not have submitted at all, but Celestial King Ling Miao was clearly the kind that was incredibly rash, and was presently in a moment of fury, so what reason could she have now?

If he argued, what if he got killed? Wouldn’t he have died for nothing?

This kind of death was really too meaningless. Therefore, he had to survive, and then find out the reason why.

Pa! Pa! Pa!

Celestial King Ling Miao continued to wave her hand, slap after slap raining down on the Full Winds Celestial King’s face. Her conduct was always simple and rough. If you didn’t submit, she would simply beat you into submission. If you didn’t speak, then she would simply beat you into talking.

The Green Wolf Celestial King and Celestial King Yuanfang were both stunned, confused, and flustered because from a certain aspect, they belonged to the same group as the Full Winds Celestial King. If the Full Winds Celestial King “would rather die than submit”, then wouldn’t they also be beaten?

‘Better you die than us, so you had best quickly confess.’

The two great Celestial Kings were both looking at the Full Winds Celestial King expectantly, hoping that he would quickly speak.

‘F*ck!’

The Full Winds Celestial King instantly felt an urge to commit murder. ‘What kind of expression are you two wearing?’

Finally, Lu Hairong snapped out of it. She bowed respectfully towards Celestial King Ling Miao, and said, “Lady Ling Miao, Hairong asks to be excused.”

It was apparent that she knew Celestial King Ling Miao.

Though Celestial King Ling Miao was still fuming in rage, she was very kind towards Lu Hairong. Nodding, she said, “Go on.”

Lu Hairong descended, and stretching out her hand, she grabbed Hu Niu, Ling Han, and all the others. Then, with a flash of her figure, she was already far away.

The Green Wolf Celestial King and Celestial King Yuanfang were both anxious. They wanted to break into a run in pursuit, but there was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King standing just right there. She had not yet spoken to excuse them, so how could they possibly dare to take one step beyond the limit?

Thus, they could only watch helplessly from where they were.
