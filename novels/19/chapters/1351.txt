Chapter 1352 Earning Money Through Bloody Battles

Because they had handed all their wealth over to Ding Ping, all of them mobilized and came to the tournament grounds to watch the battles.

This was a very hot-blooded place, and the people seated in the spectators’ stands were all loudly cheering, whereas in the sandpit down below, there was presently a man fiercely battling with a huge wild boar. The cultivation level of both fighters was not high, as they were both in the Spiritual Ocean Tier, but the situation was still extremely cruel and bloody.

The wild boar’s stomach had been split open, and blood, and even intestines, was spilling out, whereas the man had lost his left arm, blood spraying madly from his wound.

But both the eyes of the man and boar were bloodshot with the violence and battle. Unless one side collapsed, the battle would definitely not stop.

“Wasn’t it said that the demonic beasts and humans here are equals?” Ding Ping asked curiously.

“Being equals is only limited to those demonic beasts that can take on human form.” Jiang Yuefeng helped to clear the doubts of his youngest junior brother. “In the eyes of Immortals, mortals and mortal beasts are all ants, so how could they possibly care?”

Everyone felt rueful. They had all come from a small world, and ascended to this level step by step from a mortal body. They definitely would not be able to see mortals as mere ants.

Finally, it was still that human who was stronger, and stabbed the wild boar to death. However, he, too, had paid a massive price, as his stomach was also torn open by the fangs of the wild boar. Much of his internal organs had spilled out from the serious wound.

However, cultivators had strong vitality, so as long as he managed to rest in time, he could still recover. In the case of the missing limb, though, it was definitely impossible to regrow the lost limb unless he gained a natural treasure or managed to advance into the Immortal level.

Ding Ping went down to register himself to take part in the battles, but because he was betting too many True Origin Stones, the tournament authorities did not immediately agree. Instead, they first evaluated his abilities.

However, the pinnacle level was not obvious to the eye, so they could only tell that Ding Ping was in the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. Thus, after slight consideration, the tournament authorities accepted Ding Ping’s wager.

However, his battle would only begin after a while later. There were really too many people battling here.

Their first aim was profit, and the second was fame.

Profit was understandable. If one won 10 times consequently, they would be able to use a small capital to earn huge profit. In terms of fame, members of great clans would frequently watch the battles here. If one managed to attract their eyes and join a powerful clan, they would naturally have boundless prospects.

There was a total of three great clans in the Gathering Wind City, and they were the Lin, Li, and Sima Clan. They all had a grand elder at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier backing them. They were like stabilizing forces for the city, and had been reigning over Gathering Wind City for more than 100,000,000 years.

It was said that one would rather become a dog of the three great clans than become the leader of a small clan, which showed how much power was held in the hands of the three great clans. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The tournament grounds was jointly built and established by the three great clans, and thus, no one had ever dared to cause trouble here. They all adhered to the rules of the three great clans.

In the southern part of the tournament grounds, a spectator’s grandstand was abruptly erected like it was a lofty throne. That was a spectator’s stand that was reserved especially for the three great clans. Outsiders would not even have the right to go up to that stand. There was once a Sun Moon Tier cultivator who was so outrageously bold that he dared to climb up that stand to take a look. In the end, he was apprehended by the three great clans and had his flesh cut off at the city gates while he was still alive. He only died of pure pain after more than 100 years had passed.

In Gathering Wind City, the three great clans were true immortals that could not be defied.

One after another, bloody battles endlessly continued, and practically each battle would leave the victor alive and the loser dead, which was incredibly cruel.

Slightly less than half a day later, it was finally Ding Ping’s turn.

His first opponent was a middle-aged man at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. It was unknown whether he was in the early stage, middle stage, or other stages. This man had cold, merciless eyes. His upper body was bare and covered with multiple scars.

This meant that he had experienced who knew how many deadly, tough battles in the tournament grounds, and to be able to survive successfully after so many battles, this man’s battle prowess was definitely not to be underestimated.

“Please!” Ding Ping raised his clasped hands.

Shua, he had just raised his hands when he saw a dark light flash past. The middle-aged man had already started his attack. His feet stepped on the ground, and he jumped high into the air. The long saber he was holding in his hand was raised, and a sharp light was released. It was extremely blinding, and one would involuntarily close his eyes at its brightness.

And it was in that one instant that his saber would also descend and directly hack his opponent to death.

Ding Ping’s eyes were irritated, and true enough, he leant his head to one side to prevent his eyes from being wounded.

Boom, the long saber waved downwards. This was the strike of one at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, so it was very frightening.

Just when it looked like the saber’s blade was about to slash onto Ding Ping’s neck, the middle-aged man involuntarily revealed a cold smirk. With them being so close, there was definitely no one that would be able to dodge this slash of his. It was really lucky; the opponent he encountered today was really too weak!

He was employed by the tournament authorities, and had to battle once every 10 days. Whether he won or lose, he would be rewarded. Of course, the reward for winning far exceeded the reward for a defeat.

Pa!

Precisely at this moment, Ding Ping was seen stretching out his hand and gripping onto the long saber. By force, he had stopped the course of the saber.

‘What?!’

The middle-aged man was so overcome with shock that his eyes were almost popping out. He had used his full strength in this slash, so how could it possibly be caught with a single hand? Even if you used Origin Power as defense, you should have had all your fingers severed as well, and the might of the saber would not cease, but would continue to slice off your head.

Ding Ping smiled softly, and the middle-aged man was sent flying out with a casual shake of his hand. Bang, he crashed heavily into the wall of the tournament grounds.

This wall was forged from a special rock of the Immortal Realm, and added with a formation, it could be claimed that no one below the Heavenly Body Tier could damage it. Thus, with this crash, a bloody mist sprayed out from all over the middle-aged man’s body, and he directly lost consciousness.

At first, it was a complete dead silence, but what followed soon after was thunderous applause. Innumerable people were screaming shrilly, and some women were throwing coy looks at Ding Ping. There were even some extremely bold women who even took off their undergarments and threw them down into the tournament grounds.

If Ding Ping picked up someone’s undergarment, he would be able to spend a night of enjoyment with the owner.

The Old Ginseng couldn’t help but be envious. There were so many undergarments there. He felt like he could no longer control his hands. A powerful force was surging madly within him, and he almost turned into an evil wolf that was howling up at the skies.

“Yi, this brat is quite strong!” On the spectator’s grandstand for the three great clans, a young man whose skin was blue all over revealed an expression of surprise.

His name was Sima Lin, and he was from the Sima Clan. This clan was not made of pure humans, so their skin was blue in color, and in the Sima Clan, the bluer your skin was, the purer your bloodline was it meant. This Sima Lin was a well-known figure of the younger generation of the Sima Clan.

“Indeed.” The person next to him was also a young man, and his looks were handsome to the point of being bewitching. If he dressed in feminine attire, there would definitely be no one who would suspect that he was actually a man.

And his actions were indeed very feminine. He used two fingers to gently hold onto his winecup, his little finger protruding. His brows and lips were thin, exhibiting feminine charm.

“Hualan Tuo may not be considered an elite, but he has been in the tournament ring for 39 years, and has experienced no less than 1000 battles, so he is incredibly experienced. Though he has also lost before, he has never lost so badly.”

“This youth is truly worth nurturing.”

This man was a leading figure in the younger generation of the Lin Clan. His name was Lin Xian, and he had a gentle and reserved demeanor. He had also been known as a poisonous snake.

Sitting together with the two of them was a beautiful woman. She was a noble daughter of the Li Clan, and her name was Li Ruotong.

“Our Li Clan will take him!” she said calmly, but her tone was incredibly determined.
