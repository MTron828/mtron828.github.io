Chapter 1761: Celestial Bath Pool

“That’s right!” Small Tower nodded frankly. “However, the growth of this mother tree was also expedited, and it is far from becoming a Source Power. Thus, it is presently impossible for you to extract the Source Power.”

“Then how much longer would it take?” Ling Han asked.

“At least a few eras,” Small Tower replied calmly.

Ling Han shook his head. There was no way to expect it then. A few hundred million years was too long. Perhaps it would be faster for him to find another Reincarnation Tree. In the Celestial Realm, there was definitely no small number of Celestial Kings that had lived longer than an epoch.

No matter what, the Seven Lives Divine Clouds was considerably satisfied with the conditions inside the Black Tower. There was no small number of medicinal ingredients here, enough for it to rule over. There was a group of lackeys for it to boss around, and there was a mother tree which was the source of all the Celestial medicines in this world too.

The Seven Lives Divine Clouds made an agreement with Ling Han. Every 1,000 years, it would provide some celestial fluid for Ling Han, but Ling Han also warned it that it definitely could not be sprayed out from a specific part of its body.

This Celestial medicine said that there was another Celestial medicine which was on extremely bad terms with it in this place. The two of them would always end up fighting when they met each other.

The other Celestial medicine was called “Ultimate Celestial Elimination”, and what it contained was completely the Regulations of Poison. Anywhere it passed, all living creatures would perish. Thus, the medicinal ingredients here feared this Ultimate Celestial Elimination very much, and begged the Seven Lives Divine Clouds to stop the Ultimate Celestial Elimination from going around anywhere it liked.

Part of the reason why the two Celestial medicines would fight was because of this, and the other part was that both wanted to become the boss of this place.

And now, the Seven Lives Divine Clouds was trying its best to spur Ling Han on into killing the Ultimate Celestial Elimination.

Ling Han naturally ignored it. He did not have the slightest interest in the Regulations of Poison. Furthermore, while the Seven Lives Divine Clouds, which was similarly a Celestial medicine, and might have no fear of its poisonous traits, he himself was not immune. If he were to go and retrieve the Ultimate Celestial Elimination, the possibility of him dying was much higher.

Even the large black dog shook his head. If anyone wanted to retrieve a Celestial medicine like the Ultimate Celestial Elimination, he would at least have to be an Immortal Palace Tier elite to be able to accomplish the feat.

“Now that we’ve got the Celestial medicine, let’s go,” Ling Han said.

“Brat, your palate is really too easily satisfied. How could you be satisfied with a single Celestial Medicine?” the large black dog scoffed. “There are lots of good stuff here! Ahead of us is the treasury, and don’t tell me you don’t want a Pseudo-Celestial Tool?”

Ling Han’s need for a Pseudo-Celestial Tool was really not all that high, but he was very interested in top-grade Godly metal and Pseudo-Divine Metal. He thought that since they were already thieves, then they might as well get some more treasures.

He could think of repayment after he became a Celestial King, he said to himself.

The large black dog looked like he was taking a walk in a park, and went in twists and turns while leading Ling Han and the Empress. Very soon, they had walked out of the mountains, and a group of palaces appeared ahead of them, stretching out for who knew how many miles.

“Those are all treasure troves!” The large black dog looked down from above, his eyes shining.

“There is a protective formation,” Ling Han said after a glance.

“In front of me, there is no such thing as formations!” the large black dog declared proudly.

They arrived in front of the first palace, and the large black dog immediately began unravelling the formation. Ling Han also lent him a hand. The man and dog cooperated together, and they very soon created an opening in the protective formation of the palace.

“You are the type suitable to become a thief, brat!” the large black dog praised.

“What can you expect from a hog but a grunt? Why does a compliment from your mouth sound so awkward?” Ling Han fanned his hands.

They entered the palace. This was a store of ingredients, and primarily contained fabrics. They were not ordinary materials, but consisted of the silk spun by Immortal Beasts as well as woven from the fur of Immortal Beasts.

And this could not be considered Celestial Material yet, and could only be considered Pseudo-Celestial Material—only Celestial King-level was worthy of being called Celestial Material, but Pseudo-Celestial Material was already very extraordinary. Ling Han naturally would not be reserved, and gathered everything.

The large black dog and Ling Han began fighting over the spoils. Not only had they stuffed their Spatial God Tools to their fullest, they even wrapped themselves in it. They were really pretentious.

After they had swept through this palace completely, they went to the second palace.

After breaking through the formation and entering, they saw that there were actually multiple pools here.

“Huh?!”

Ling Han and his group all exclaimed in surprise. These pools were really too extraordinary, exuding the light of great dao. Regulations had taken solid form, swimming in the water like fishes.

“Celestial Bath Pools!” the large black dog called out loudly, and immediately jumped into one of the pools with a splash. He opened his mouth, and simply floated around in the pool of water like that, absorbing the precious essence in the fluids of the pool.

Ling Han and the Empress also jumped in respectively. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden would not be able to enjoy such benefits.

It was invigorating!

Great Dao entered into Ling Han’s body, using the waters of the pool as a bridge. It seemed as if the heaven and earth were clearing his doubts and offering teachings inside his body; it was possible for even an idiot’s cultivation level to soar greatly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be stunned. Just what kind of heaven-defying technique was this?

He was even more curious by now. Which major sect did this treasury belong to? They were definitely exorbitantly wealthy!

It was unknown how many treasures were contained in the waters of the pool. There was Saintly medicine of the highest grade, and even a small amount of Celestial medicine, as well as the essence of Immortal Beasts. Ling Han could see a tip of the iceberg through absorbing the pool’s fluids. Those were the horns of a few Immortal Beasts that had been ground into dust, and their murderous aura had been erased by an elite. Finally, they turned into a medicinal bath with boundless benefits.

He was rich, he was rich.

Ling Han and his group did not make any sound, and tried their best to absorb the treasure fluid as much as possible.

There were only a total of 10 such pools!

Seven days later, Ling Han was the first to absorb all the essence in a pool. He climbed out, and entered into the fourth pool. Two days later, the Empress and the large black dog came out at practically the same time, and entered into the fifth and sixth pool, respectively.

It was clear from this that it was Ling Han’s physique that was still the strongest. The Empress’s Divine Fetus allowed her to split out nine doppelgangers to simultaneously share and absorb the medicinal effects together, but the large black dog was actually incredibly freakish as well. This was a little shocking. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Could it be that it was a Divine Fetus as well?

When Ling Han thought that this damn dog could possibly be a Divine Fetus as well, he felt the words ‘Divine Fetus’ had become very murky from now onwards.

The gap between them soon became wider. When Ling Han entered into the seventh pool, a whole three days had passed before the Empress and the large black dog finally entered into the eighth and ninth pool, respectively. When Ling Han entered into the 10th pool, the Empress and the large black dog entered respectively only after he had absorbed about half of the medicinal effects in it.

The three “people” worked at the same time, and very soon absorbed the 10th pool completely as well.

A heat energy soared in Ling Han’s body, immediately drying his clothes. He burped, and could see the divine light of great dao had turned into divine red clouds that spluttered out. That was because the Regulations in his body were too deep and resounding, and he did not manage to digest them completely, so they had soared out of his body.

It couldn’t be helped. Who asked them to be thieves? They naturally were more concerned about consuming first before slowly digesting what they had eaten.

...These pools could not be moved. Otherwise, Ling Han would definitely have carried them off and slowly absorbed them. The condition now was actually very wasteful.

Zhi!

It was at this moment that the great doors of the palace opened, and a person walked in.

He was a young man who looked very handsome. His expression was filled with anticipation, and he appeared to be incredibly excited. However, he immediately discovered the presence of two other people and a dog in the palace, and his expression suddenly became very dramatic.

This could be imagined because it was really too unexpected.

Ling Han was also surprised. He realized that this world was really too small.

That person was Han Qi!

Could it be that this was the treasury of the Han Clan?
