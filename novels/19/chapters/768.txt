Chapter 769: The Power of Formations

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A Shattering Void Tier ice dragon!

Theoretically, the ice dragon was invincible because it was formed by a formation, and as long as the formation was still present, it would be undying, which obviously meant invincibility. However, it was also precisely because it was formed by a formation that once the formation broke, it would naturally disappear, still having its weakness.

Were formations easy to break?

Ling Han had Helian Xun Xue attack the formation’s eye with full strength while he controlled the ice dragon not to attack Helian Xun Xue.

Hong!

Helian Xun Xue attacked.

She now increased her cultivation to the peak stage of the Heaven Tier, but the last step was too hard to cross, making her unable to break through for a long time. This step could take three to five years, and could also take thirty to fifty years, or three hundred to five hundred years—she could be even unable to break through in her lifetime.

The difference between the Shattering Void and the Heaven Tier was fundamental, and definitely couldn’t be crossed over simply by spending a long time.

Even so, Helian Xun Xue’s attacks were still extremely swift and fierce, and unleashing one move seemed to be able to flatten the entire imperial palace. It wasn’t impossible; Shattering Void Tier elites could strike down the stars in the sky, so what would be so strange about a Heaven Tier elite flattening an imperial palace?

Hong , the attack smashed into the formation; the entire formation was instantly blasted back nearly three hundred meters, but 108 formation’s eyes maintained the original spacing, while the ice dragon was also still present, coiling behind Ling Han and emitting a bone-penetrating chill.

“My full strength attack actually can’t break this formation!” Helian Xun Xue was shocked; she cultivated both Origin Power and physical arts, and on top of her own freakishness, though unable to break through the barrier of the Shattering Void Tier, she was still infinitely close to that level.

Too astonishing.

Ling Han was extremely pleased. Tenth-tier formations were tenth-tier formations indeed, not even breaking under a Heaven Tier elite’s bombardment.

“Let this lady try!” Yi Shuang Shuang appeared, looking like she was itching to have a go.

“You?” Ling Han pondered. “Let’s go into the sky. I’m afraid that if you lose control, you’ll destroy my imperial palace—that totem of mine just formed!”

Above the imperial palace, there was a very faint shadow of a black tower; it was Great Ling Empire’s totem, but it’d just formed. According to Yi Shuang Shuang’s statement, after aggregating the power of the people’s minds, it could become corporeal and protect the country forever.

If the nation was present, the tower would be present, and if the nation perished, the tower would perish!

The two of them rose into the sky. Ling Han still controlled the ice dragon to remain motionless, letting Yi Shuang Shuang attack—this was mainly to see the formation’s defense’s limit.

“The first attack, battle prowess of the Shattering Void Tier, one star.” Yi Shuang Shuang was also very cooperative and lifted a palm to swat at the formation, unleashing supreme might. If the ice dragon didn’t stand in front of Ling Han, he wouldn’t possibly be watching the battle at such a close distance.

The power of the Shattering Void Tier surpassed reason and made him slightly worried—even if he used Black Tower’s power boost now, would he be able to reach Shattering Void Tier battle prowess?

Hong!

The palm swiped by, and the formation was obviously knocked flying several hundred meters, but it was still very well maintained as the ice dragon was still present.

“The second attack, Shattering Void Tier two stars.”

***

“The third attack, Shattering Void Tier three stars.”

After the fifth attack, the formation finally collapsed. Unable to endure battle prowess of Shattering Void Tier’s five stars, the 108 formation’s eyes scattered everywhere.

This was the limit.

Ling Han retrieved the formation’s eyes, set up the formation again, and said, “Now try it when the ice dragon’s present, and see how many stars of Shattering Void Tier battle prowess it can reach.”

Yi Shuang Shuang directly charged up with Shattering Void Tier five stars’ battle prowess, while the ice dragon launched a counterattack. The sky instantly turned into a field of chilling ice; even Heaven Tier elites would be frozen into a lump of ice if they were too close, and could only attack few times in the distance.

Yi Shuang Shuang was suppressed and couldn’t rival the ice dragon, but she immediately raised her battle prowess, star by star.

“Shattering Void Tier seven stars.”

Soon, the limit of the formation was found out. It was able to equal Shattering Void Tier seven stars—when Yi Shuang Shuang increased her battle prowess to eight stars, the ice dragon was immediately suppressed, and the formation was blasted apart once again not much later.

Ling Han was extremely pleased. Although there were many Shattering Void Tier elites now, how many could surpass battle prowess of Shattering Void Tier seven stars? According to what Helian Xun Xue said, the entire Helian royal family only had three such elites.

The sea race’s monstrousness lay in that they all possessed true dragon’s blood, and those with a profound bloodline could borrow ancestral blood at the Heaven Tier to summon a true dragon, from which they could comprehend the profoundness of the Shattering Void Tier, making the breakthrough of this stage far easier for them compared to others.

However, after advancing into the Shattering Void Tier, the power of bloodline would almost be exhausted, and only a few would be able to exceed the fifth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and the majority would possess two star or three star Shattering Void Tier battle prowess till death.

This time, even if the Xianyu Family sent a Shattering Void Tier elite over, Ling Han would still be unafraid, for Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation was enough to deal with them... they wouldn’t dispatch all their strongest elites at once, right?

“Why are you willing to help me?” Ling Han asked Yi Shuang Shuang.

“This lady is in love with you. Is that reason okay?” Yi Shuang Shuang said very casually.

“Hehe!” Ling Han laughed—it was too fake—but he still said, “Naturally, this young master is handsome and easygoing and has amazing martial arts talent, so it only stands to reason to be liked by tens of thousands of girls.”

“Pah!” Yi Shuang Shuang spat, and said, “You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well, not knowing what freakishness is! Might as well tell you, in the divine realm, there are plenty of those in their twenties that crossed into the Shattering Void Tier. Take this lady for example, the Shattering Void Tier at twenty-seven years old!”

Ling Han let out a “ha,” pointed at her, and said, “You’ve finally admitted that you’re from the divine realm!”

Yi Shuang Shuang arched her snow-white neck like a proud white swan, and said, “So what, are you going to bite me?”

Ling Han sighed—why was this woman such a scoundrel? What a rogue! He was curious, and asked, “Then why don’t you return to the divine realm, and why help me—don’t say that you’re a good person, I don’t believe it!”

Yi Shuang Shuang half-opened her small mouth, and, after a while, said, “Why can’t this lady be a good person?”

“From head to toe, and from in and out, you don’t look anywhere like a good person.” Ling Han shook his head resolutely.

“From in and out? Tsk, tsk, tsk, damn brat, you’re one bold pervert. Say, when did you peep at this lady?” Yi Shuang Shuang snapped her fingers, giving off crackling sounds.

“Ok, ok, ok, don’t be so bored and don’t turn aside the topic!” Ling Han said with a serious look. “Although having a powerful Shattering Void Tier elite’s help is awesome, I want even less to have an unstable element beside me.”

Yi Shuang Shuang snickered, and said, “Aren’t you afraid of this lady turning on you when you say such things? You have to know, for a small guy like you... this lady picks river snails with three fingers—snatch and never miss!”

“If you were to attack, you would’ve already done it, so why wait till now?” Ling Han said indifferently. “So, I would rather believe that you have other plans.”

Yi Shuang Shuang propped her chin in her hand, and said, “As someone at the Deity Transformation Tier, you’re quite daring, clearly knowing this lady’s identity and still daring to lay out the cards! Alright, for your boldness’ sake, this lady will tell you that she feels you have a shocking secret, which she wants to squeeze out of you!”
