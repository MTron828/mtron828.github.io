Shi Ming unleashed his full battle prowess, not caring that he would be targeted by the restrictions of the mystery realm. He regained his might as an elite at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

In this mystery realm, this was definitely an invincible power.

Peng!

Ling Han was sent flying by Shi Ming’s strike. He felt extreme discomfort, and it was as if his insides were churning.

Although he possessed a power of nine stars and was only a tad away from reaching 10 stars, this tiny distance was like an insurmountable gulf. A power of nine stars still belonged to the Mountain River Tier, while a power of 10 stars... had already advanced to the Sun Moon Tier.

As freakish as Ling Han was, he still couldn’t make up for the gulf in power between the Mountain River Tier and the Sun Moon Tier. He was simply no match for Sun Moon Tier elites.

This time, he didn’t have any Lion Seal to use. Anyhow, he wouldn’t dare to use a Lion Seal even if he did still have one. The restriction here targeted anyone who possessed power at the Sun Moon Tier, and he certainly didn’t want to be targeted.

In any case, it mattered little that Shi Ming possessed power at the Sun Moon Tier. His power was only at the low extreme, and as such, the most it could do was cause Ling Han to spit some blood. If he wanted to truly threaten Ling Han, he would need power at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

Ling Han crawled up as if nothing had happened. He then dusted himself off with a smile, and said, “You really are a bit more powerful than before. However... that’s still not enough to injure me!”

‘F*ck!’

Shi Ming was so shocked that his eyes almost popped out from his head. Ling Han had taken his full-power attack just like that?

That was the attack of a Sun Moon Tier elite! It should have been powerful enough to kill any Mountain River Tier cultivator! However, why couldn’t it deal with Ling Han?

‘Freak! He’s definitely a freak!’

“Aaaah...!” Shi Ming wailed in agony.

After launching a Sun Moon Tier attack, he was immediately targeted by the restriction of this mystery realm.

Pu, pu, pu!

Blood exploded from all parts of his body, and he instantly became a bloody figure.

However, the pain helped him come to his senses, and he glared at Ling Han with a venomous look. Killing intent oozed from his body.

He was going to kill this prodigy; he was going to pave a smooth path for his descendants!

“Die!” He was drenched in blood as he launched another attack at Ling Han. He combusted his blood essence to fight against the attacks of the restriction, and this allowed him to still have enough power to suppress Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. Apart from himself, no one else knew just how powerful his physique was.

Shi Ming wanted to kill him with power at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier?

It wasn’t enough!

Ling Han unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword, and it radiated with a brilliant glow as he battled against Shi Ming.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Shi Ming was able to send Ling Han flying with every attack that he unleashed—this was due to his crushing advantage in cultivation level. However, the most these attacks could do was cause Ling Han to vomit a few mouthfuls of blood. Meanwhile, Shi Ming’s own situation was far direr. The attacks from the restriction continued to wound his internal organs, Godly bones, and meridians.

Pa!

During the 20th exchange, he threw a fist at Ling Han. However, his entire arm exploded into a cloud of blood and bone shards. The power of Sun Moon Tier elites was far too powerful, however, and thus this cloud of blood and bone shards still possessed a devastating destructive ability.

A few members of the Gao Faction were standing nearby, and they were instantly smashed into bits by the cloud of blood and bones. Only one person managed to survive, with the others all being insta-killed.

However, Shi Ming had already lost all ability to reason. There was only a single thought running through his mind at this moment, and that was to kill Ling Han. Thus, he attacked Ling Han without restraint, not caring that his body was already on the verge of collapse.

Pa!

His other arm also exploded, and he became an armless person.

However, he still didn’t stop, and he raised his legs to kick at Ling Han.

Pa, pa!

It wasn’t long before his legs also exploded into clouds of blood and bone. However, he exhaled a breath of air and sent his body crashing toward Ling Han. His expression was as if he wanted to drag Ling Han down with him.

Ling Han almost felt a hint of sympathy for him. Should he pity or detest such a person?

Pa!

He didn’t need to attack, and the restriction of the mystery realm ripped Shi Ming’s body into pieces. However, his eyes were still fixed on Ling Han. He was going to launch one final attack. However, he never got around to doing so, because his brain also exploded into a cloud of blood and gore.

Those at the Sun Moon Tier could already be referred to as elites. However, Shi Ming had died just like that. In fact, he didn’t even have a full corpse.

The sole remaining member of the Gao Faction almost wet his pants in fright, and he trembled in terror as he turned around to flee. This place was far too dangerous. He was going to flee straight to the entrance, where he could wait for Venerable Trinity to reopen the mystery realm. He didn’t want to stay in this place for one second longer.

Ling Han shook his head as he sheathed his sword. He then walked toward Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun.

He would feel some pleasure when he crushed profligate disciples. For example, he would definitely feel great when he eventually stomped on Gao Huang’s face. However, his encounter with Shi Ming could only make him sigh with emotion. His mood also became a little heavy.

‘There’s no need to feel sympathetic toward such kinds of people, though there’s also no need to hate them.’

Ling Han rid his mind of these thoughts. He then smiled at Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun, and said, “Let’s go.”

“Ling Han, you’re so stwong!” Hu Feiyun was biting into a fruit, so her words were a little unclear. Her blood had been churning in excitement when she watched Ling Han charge in and out of the enemies. Her admiration for him was immense.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and replied, “Of course!”

His mood became a little better.

The three of them walked for a while when Ling Han suddenly sensed danger. He instantly thrust his sword toward the ground.

Pu!

Sword light shot into the earth, and a web of cracks instantly appeared on the ground.

“F*ck your entire family! You almost skewered my a*s!” A white shadow dashed out from the ground, and shouted, “Eat your grandpa’s ginseng foot!”

Shua!

The white shadow instantly shot toward Ling Han.

It was the despicable ginseng!

He truly came and went like a shadow. He had planned to ambush Ling Han, yet unfortunately for him, Ling Han had cast his divine sense to monitor the surroundings. Not only had he failed his ambush, but he had even been attacked by Ling Han first. Moreover, Ling Han had been extremely close to hitting him.

Ling Han unleashed his Fast Technique on the old ginseng.

“You’re still 10,000 years too young to kill your ginseng grandpa!” the old ginseng shouted in a strange voice.

His reaction was extremely quick, and he transformed the power of Regulations into sabers, spears, and arrows before shooting them toward Ling Han.

“Didn’t you say I was 800 years too young last time?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Pei! It’s because I’ve become stronger!”

The old ginseng weaved through sky and earth at an astonishing speed.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Hurry up and jump into my bowl! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

“You dare to threaten me? Watch how I stomp you to death!” The old ginseng flared up in rage, and his attacks rained down even thicker and faster.

Ling Han didn’t hold back anymore.

Boom!

Terrifying flames burst from his body, and divine patterns intertwined in the air.

“F*ck! I hate fire the most!” the old ginseng wailed. He instantly scampered dozens of meters back, finally stopping his attacks. He wore a fearful expression as he stared at the flames.

Although he was quick, the might of ice and divine flame could still restrain him.

“Despicable ginseng, why did you appear again?” Ling Han asked.

The old ginseng plopped onto a stone and crossed his legs. His attitude seemed smug, and he said, “I want to give you an opportunity.”

Pu!

‘Are you f*cking kidding me?’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Oh? What opportunity might this be? Perhaps you want to donate your body? Then hurry up and come to my bowl!”

The old ginseng instantly jumped up, and shouted, “Pei, pei, pei! I’m not interested in men! Don’t even think about taking my a*s!”

Ling Han shook his head. This despicable ginseng had grown up in this mystery realm, so how had he developed such a sh*tty personality?

Could scoundrels... also be born like that?

“I’ll give you some divine fluid if you take me out of this mystery realm.”

The old ginseng made Ling Han an offer.
