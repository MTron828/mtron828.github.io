Chapter 2174: Father

‘Wasn’t she a distant relative? How did she suddenly become his mother?’

Upon seeing Chen Shuangshuang, Ling Jianxue became even more anxious, saying, “Senior Sister, why haven’t you returned to the sect? It’s too dangerous here!”

‘F*ck! You’ve forgotten about your mother after getting a wife?’

After meeting her son, and with her husband to fight against the enemy, she was feeling much better than before, even though her anxiousness was yet to subside. At the very least, she was now in the mood to think about other things as well.

She grabbed her son’s ear, and said, “Good one, you’re not even going to care about your mother now?”

“Hehe.” Ling Jianxue could only chuckle foolishly.

“Exactly, you shouldn’t be like that,” Chen Shuangshuang said in concurrence. “You need to worry about your mother first! Ah, damn it! Such a beautiful sister, but I have to refer to her as aunty in the future?”

She wore an aggrieved expression. Mucking around with beautiful women was her greatest indulgence, yet there was actually a beautiful woman whom she couldn’t refer to as sister now. This caused her to feel extremely aggrieved.

Ling Jianxue also wore a gloomy expression. Why was this senior sister so airheaded?

Beside them, Wenren Yue was able to understand everything, and an expression of realization spread across his face.

“Hang on, who is this person? He’s far too powerful!” Chen Shuangshuang was extremely simple-minded, and she had already forgotten about the matters from just a moment ago. She pointed at Ling Han, and her expression was as if she had seen a ghost.

A Heaven Soul cultivator was actually battling against a Fifth Secret elite? And he was even enjoying the upper hand, and pummeling the Fifth Secret elite? Even though he would be sent flying each time he was hit.

However, so what if he was sent flying? He wouldn’t suffer any injuries, and he would immediately charge back. He was just like a god of war.

He was far too freakish.

“I don’t know, either,” Ling Jianxue murmured in reply.

Pa!

Helian Xunxue lightly smacked her son’s head, chiding, “That’s your father!”

Pu!

Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang spluttered and choked in unison.

‘Hah?!’

“M-my father?” Ling Jianxue asked in astonishment. “Isn’t father still trying to open the sky in the small world?”

“Just how prodigious is your father? He arrived at the Celestial Realm a long time ago, and it was only because the Celestial Realm was too large that he spent 10,000 years to find us,” Helian Xunxue said with a proud expression. She harbored great reverence toward Ling Han.

Ling Jianxue couldn’t help but grimace. As a prodigy, he was a relatively proud person. He had once dreamed about entering the small world to help his father open the sky when he became powerful enough. Or perhaps he would leave an abundant amount of cultivation resources in the Ancient Realm for his father when he finally managed to open the sky, helping him soar to greater heights.

Even though there were explicit rules in the Celestial Realm forbidding people from bringing any living things back from the Ancient Realm or small worlds, powerful sects could still enjoy a slight exception. They could occasionally bring a few people to the Celestial Realm, and no one would bat an eye.

Of course, they could legitimately only do this very occasionally. Otherwise, the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier forces would all gang up to attack them. Regardless of how powerful they were, they wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of destruction.

In Ling Jianxue’s mind, he had only started cultivating a few dozen years later than Ling Han. However, the environment that they were in was completely different. He could receive more cultivation resources than Ling Han even dared to dream of. As such, he should have instantly surpassed Ling Han’s cultivation level, and left his father far behind him.

However, the reality was starkly different.

Not only was Ling Han’s cultivation superior to his, but even his battle prowess was as mighty and domineering as the heavens.

He was at the Heaven Soul, yet he could rival Fifth Secret elites!

‘Good heavens!

‘This is my father?’

“Your father is truly powerful!” Chen Shuangshuang murmured. She had been given a fright by Ling Han before, and now she was given another fright.

Fifth Secret, Ling Han’s limit was actually rivaling a Fifth Secret elite.

“I know,” Ling Jianxue replied in a daze. Even now, he was still unable to fathom that a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator could actually be this freakish. Moreover, this unbelievably freakish person was actually his father.

Tang Tao looked over, and there was slight hesitation in his eyes.

He was pondering whether he should target Ling Jianxue and the others or not.

Initially, this wouldn’t have been a problem. They were only juniors at the Dividing Soul Tier and Severing Mundane Tier, so as a Fourth Secret elite, he could have easily captured them with a single wave of his hand. Now, however, he was apprehensive of Ling Han.

Could Sui Yuanliang defeat Ling Han?

This was impossible.

Even if Ling Han was unable to suppress Sui Yuanliang, if he wanted to leave, who could stop him? Moreover, once Ling Han left, news of them hunting disciples of the Heavenly Saint Palace would definitely get out.

When a Celestial King was enraged, even heaven and earth would change color. Right now, they were facing an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

The Dragon Universe Palace was definitely done for.

That being the case, why would he still stay in the Dragon Universe Palace? Even though he was the second palace leader, in reality, his relationship with Sui Yuanliang was only one of partnership and mutual utilization. How could he die for Sui Yuanliang?

With this in mind, he immediately made a decision. He directly turned around to leave, as carefree and casual as could be.

“Tang! Tao!” Sui Yuanliang roared in rage.

However, Tang Tao didn’t as much as pause, instantly disappearing into the dense forest, and vanishing without a trace.

He only knew that Sui Yuanliang viewed the Cold Moon Light Sun Sword with great importance. However, as for its explicit use, Sui Yuanliang hadn’t revealed even the slightest bit of information. Yet, he still wanted him to fight with his life? What a joke!

Meanwhile, Ling Jianxue, Chen Shuangshuang, and Wenren Yue went numb in the head when they saw this. They knew that Tang Tao had fled because of Ling Han.

That was a Fourth Secret elite!

Elsewhere, Wenren Tang was trembling in fear. He discovered that he had ridden on the wrong coattail.

Heavens! Not only was Ling Jianxue the disciple of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, but he was more so the son of that freakishly powerful person! And to think that Wenren Tang had actually sold out Ling Jianxue? Could he still live?

Wenren Tang collapsed to the ground, and he felt his ambitions for power slowly draining away from him. Right now, he only wanted to live a calm and peaceful life.

Immediately after Tang Tao left, many other members of the Dragon Universe Palace hurried over.

“Palace Leader, the nineteenth young master was killed by this person!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Elder Cheng Qing was also killed…”

“The third palace leader was also killed…”

They reported these pieces of news one by one, all of them incriminating Ling Han.

Sui Yuanliang was also angered upon hearing this. ‘I haven’t even killed your son yet, yet you’ve already killed my son and the third palace leader? And you’re acting as if you’re the victim?’

“Brat, I’m going to destroy you!” he howled. With a wave of his right hand, he retrieved a damaged piece of paper. This was a burnt piece of paper, and only less than half of it remained.

However, once it appeared, it radiated with an overwhelming might that could suppress the heavens. It was like a Celestial King Tier decree that could command the heavens.

“Suppress him!” Sui Yuanliang roared, an expression of reluctance on his face. He had obtained this decree by luck, and it was more so a damaged decree. Once it was used, it was very likely that it couldn’t be used again. However, if he didn’t kill Ling Han, it would be impossible for him to keep secret his actions of hunting the disciples of the Heavenly Saint Palace. At that time, when the Dragon Universe Palace was destroyed, he would also be killed. Thus, what use would this treasure be, regardless of how powerful it was?

In any case, he was dead set on obtaining the Cold Moon Light Sun Sword.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had reached a key barrier. Under the influence of his rage, he had forgotten everything, and only had thoughts of battle. This state had allowed him to gradually cultivate a fist technique.

This couldn’t be regarded as a secret technique per se, as it was only a form of willpower and aura. Regardless of what obstacles lay ahead, he would obliterate them all with his fist.

However, Ling Han had a nagging feeling that he was still missing something, something that would unleash the true might of this fist technique.

Only when the piece of damaged paper appeared did a cold chill suddenly run down his spine, causing him to come to a sudden realization. He was missing the threatening pressure of life and death.

His physique was far too powerful. This was a good thing, but because he didn’t need to worry about life and death, it meant that he couldn’t appreciate the pressure and intensity of battle. When these feelings finally arose, he instantly attained enlightenment.

Boom!

He threw a punch, causing violent flames to billow through the air.
