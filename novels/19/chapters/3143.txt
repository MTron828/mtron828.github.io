“Five overlapping layers of power!” Ji Yuanlong’s eyes lit up, and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

Just now, when Sima Rong used the four overlapping layers of power, it was already enough to make people drop their glasses in shock, and now here was another person that could use five overlapping layers of power?

A thirty-year-old Twelve Meridians and five overlapping layers of power added together created too much of an impact.

Most importantly, this guy that Sun Jianfang and the others thought was freakish was actually just a subordinate of the beauty in black clothing. This was undoubtedly even more unacceptable.

They could only hope that this man had only submitted to the woman in black because he coveted her beauty. Otherwise… it would be unbelievable.

Cao Cong charged forwards with all his might, but the raw power of both sides was more or less equal. However, one could only fire out three overlapping layers of power, while the other could fire out five overlapping layers of power. The gap between them was naturally extremely wide.

To make an unsuitable analogy, this was equivalent to five people fighting three people, and each person’s strength was more or less equal. Then who would win and who would lose?

Cao Cong was soon at a disadvantage. Under the crushing pressure of his opponent’s five overlapping layers of power, he struggled to hold on, completely unable to fight back.

Of course, it wasn’t that he didn’t have a chance to turn the tables. This was because under the weight of the five overlapping layers of power, his opponent’s power would definitely be exhausted far more than his. Thus, as long as he could hold on until his opponent’s power was exhausted, he would be able to obtain victory easily.

But the problem was, he could not hold on for that long.

His opponent’s attacks were endless, like mercury dripping onto the ground, wave after wave, making him feel like he could collapse at any moment.

“Brother Cao, I’ll help you!” Meng Ruining roared as he joined the battle.

They had known each other since the beginning of the great upheaval of heaven and earth. Afterwards, though they had all established their own forces, they were not too far apart from each other. They would also have some contact with each other. If they encountered a powerful Demonic Beast that started a massive assault of Demonic Beasts, they would even help each other.

Thus, now that an unfamiliar force had come, it was clear that they were being stepped on, so they naturally had to unite against a common enemy.

“Wang Feng, you go,” the woman in black robes said calmly.

“Yes, Banner Lord!” Behind her, another man walked out and approached Meng Ruining.

Peng, peng, peng! The moment they exchanged blows, everyone was once again shocked.

This man who looked to be only in his thirties was shockingly a top-notch king tier of Twelve Meridians. Moreover, he had also grasped five overlapping layers of power. He threw punch after punch, and Meng Ruining was completely at a disadvantage in just a single exchange.

This caused Ji Yuanlong, the old woman, and the others who were about to step forward to stop. Could it be that the nine people behind this woman were all elites of Twelve Meridians, and each of them could fire out five overlapping layers of power?

This kind of lineup was too terrifying. It was enough to sweep aside any force.

“Don’t meddle in other people’s business,” the woman in black said calmly. With a wave of her slender hand, a group of crossbowmen appeared from the ship, aiming their eerie crossbows at everyone.

Being pointed at by these crossbows, everyone felt a strong chill, and were even more confused.

It should be known that when one had reached Twelve Meridians, his reaction speed was extremely sharp. He was unafraid of even firearms, because he could send a bullet flying with a single punch.

However, being targeted by these crossbows, these elites felt even worse than being targeted by guns.

No one dared to act rashly. Even Old Venom was well-behaved. At first, he had wanted to show off and spread poison.

No one helped, and Cao Cong was very quickly defeated. He was slapped by that man, causing his face to flush red, and he even spat out blood.

He was the lord of a city, and had several thousand people under his command. Moreover, he was standing at the peak of martial arts, yet now, he was being pressed onto the ground and slapped by an elite of the same cultivation level. How could he accept this?

After that man had slapped Cao Cong Xing thirty times, he immediately retreated, and stood behind the woman in black like a servant.

On the other side, after Wang Feng sent Meng Ruining flying with a palm strike, he also retreated. He was only stopping Meng Ruining from helping. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Cao Cong spat out blood continuously. This was not because he had been severely injured, but rather because he had been angered.

Only then did the woman in black look towards Sima Rong and wave her hand, saying, “Rise.”

“Thank you, Banner Lord!” Sima Rong stood up. Though he had been kneeling for so long, there was not the slightest bit of displeasure on his face.

Everyone was both curious and stunned. What kind of background did this woman have, that she could command so many Twelve Meridians king tiers, and also make Sima Rong abandon even his pride as a king tier?

“I am Lian Xuerong, the Banner Lord of the Xuanqing Banner of Huju City of the Dark North Nation,” the woman in black clothing said. “I have come south this time to integrate all of you under the command of our Dark North Nation.”

Hmm?

Sun Jianfang and the others all sneered. They were all overlords of a region, so how could they tolerate being under someone else’s command?

Moreover, this wasn’t a recruitment by the Dark North Nation. Instead, it was a recruitment by Huju City that was under its rule. In fact, it wasn’t even the city lord who had personally come, but rather a Banner Lord.

Hehe, this was underestimating them too much, wasn’t it?

Lian Xuerong’s eyes swept over them, “Don’t think that being under the rule of our Dark North Nation is an embarrassing matter. Humph, if it was not for the fact that His Imperial Majesty has the heart to bring good fortune to the whole world, who would be willing to set foot in such a desolate land?”

Just listen to what she was saying. Others were forced to surrender, and she even looked disdainful that she was even bothering with them. This really made them feel uncomfortable.

“I’ll give you ten minutes to consider.” Lian Xuerong waved her hand, and looked at Sima Rong. “Did you find any good seedlings?”

Sima Rong immediately swept a glance at Ling Han out of the corner of his eye, but he quickly withdrew it, and said, “In reply to Banner Lord, in the desolate plains, it is difficult to find anyone outstanding.”

Lian Xuerong nodded slowly. This place was too remote, and martial arts was still in its budding stage. A Twelve Meridians was actually able to establish their own sect? What a huge joke.

There were no outstanding talents here, so it was naturally not strange.

Their conversation wasn’t loud, so Sun Jianfang and the others didn’t hear it. They only thought that Sima Rong was snitching about something.

No wonder this person could break through to Ten Meridians at twenty-four to twenty-five years old. Just look at him. The people that were casually sent out were all king tiers of Twelve Meridians, and they were only in their thirties.

What ancient inheritance had this Dark North Nation obtained? Was there a special method that could allow one to advance into Ten Meridians, or perhaps even higher?

“Banner Lord, there is a Volcanic Fruit under this pool. This subordinate has deliberately prepared it to you,” Sima Rong continued.

“Volcanic Fruit?” Lian Xuerong smiled faintly. “Although it’s not all that valuable, it can still be considered Treasured Fruit.”

“Wang Feng, go and check on the fruit. If it is ripe, pluck it.”

Wang Feng took a step forward and was just about to leap into the pool. However, Ling Han stepped forward and said, “Wait.”

“Brat, do you have any objections?” Wang Feng scoffed. He naturally wouldn’t take anyone here seriously.

“Yes.” Ling Han nodded, “This Volcanic Fruit is mine!”

“How so?” Wang Feng asked with a smile. “Did you plant this?”

Ling Han pointed at the python in the distance, and said, “This is the Demonic Beast guarding the Treasured Fruit. I killed it, so this Treasured Fruit should belong to me!”

“Oh?” Wang Feng looked surprised. With his experience, he only had to look at the size of that giant python to know that it was a Ten Meridians Demonic Beast.

This brat in front of him… could he be a Ten Meridians?
