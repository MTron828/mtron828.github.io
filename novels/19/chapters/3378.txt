Chapter 3379: Resistance for Ten Seconds in Various Ways

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

‘Are you completely focused on wealtj?’

The Fourth Prince of the Demon Race took out five Treasured Fruits of Life again and placed them on the jade plate. He would endure this.

This time, it was Ling Han who personally took part in the battle, unlike the little pink pig or the baby, where there would be variables.

Therefore, as long as he endured it a little longer, Yuwen Hou would be able to beat this b*stard up. No, kill him.

It was impossible for there to be any accidents with a mere Blood Transformation Tier, even if the latter had defeated Young Master Cat.

Yuwen Hou took a look as well and turned around. “Can we fight now?

Ling Han waved his hand, and pa, pa, pa, 33 formation foundations instantly appeared on the ground. “Come.”

A formation!

Yuwen Hou sneered. He had long understood that the Formation Masters of the human race were at most so-called Grandmasters. The formations they set up could at most fight against Inscription Tier elites.

Yes, he was indeed in the Inscription Tier, but his battle prowess was in the

Enlightenment Tier.

What formation could stop him?

Humph, he could break the formation with a single move, and then defeat Ling Han with a destructive force… kill him, he thought to himself. After being toyed with by Ling Han several times, killing intent had already risen in his heart.

He rushed out, wanting to destroy the formation in the most domineering manner, and crush Ling Han into dregs.

However, when he rushed into the formation, he immediately realized that something was wrong.

A terrifying power caused his speed to immediately slow down. Then, he involuntarily bent down.

Yuwen Hou’s expression couldn’t help but change. That power was way too terrifying.

One had to know that this formation had been created to suppress the General Vajra, and what was the greatest characteristic of the General Vajra?

Invincible Vajra, whose defense could not be broken.

Therefore, since this 33 Layered Vajra Formation was created to be used against General Vajra, its destructive power had to reach the Enlightenment

Tier.

Yuwen Hou released his full strength hurriedly and withstood the pressure of

the formation.

His battle prowess was at the Enlightenment Tier, and this formation indeed gave him pressure, but it was impossible to suppress him.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

He continued to attack. The violent impact of the power only hit a few times, and all the formation foundations were trembling, and then one of them flew up. Instantly, the power of the formation disappeared.

Yuwen Hou rushed out and threw a punch at Ling Han.

“Twenty-four seconds,” Ling Han said calmly, not dodging.

Yuwen Hou came to an abrupt halt. Twenty-four seconds. He had used twenty-four seconds to break through the formation. In other words, Ling Han had not only withstood him for ten seconds, but had more than doubled that amount.

He was incomparably depressed. Of course, this was not because Ling Han’s battle prowess was exceptional, and it made him feel very wronged.

“Thank you.” Ling Han walked over and put away the five Treasured Fruits of

Life again.

He had already eaten a Fruit of Life, and it was showing its effect now. Surging life energy circulated in his body, repairing his dao foundation.

“Are you still playing?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Seeing that Yuwen Hou and the Fourth Prince of the Demon Race had dark expressions, he said with a smile, “I promise I won’t set up any more formations.”

“Come!” The Fourth Prince of the Demon Race said. If they stopped here, they would really lose all their face today.

He threw out another five Treasured Fruits of Life. He refused to believe that Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Han had any other tricks up his sleeve.

Yuwen Hou felt a little embarrassed. He had already failed three times.

He took a deep breath, and after looking at Ling Han for a while, he suddenly struck out this time, sending a palm strike towards Ling Han.

Ling Han stood with his hands behind his back. He had no intention of dodging or parrying at all.

He was courting death!

Yuwen Hou laughed coldly. If he allowed Yuwen Hou to attack, even Enlightenment Tier elites wouldn’t be able to withstand more than a few moves from him. Did he think he was a Mystery Realm Tier-level old monster?

Boom, a palm strike landed.

“Oh no!”

“How is this possible?”

“Is Ling Han seeking his own death?”

Everyone shook their heads. He had shown off too much.

“What!”

However, in the next moment, everyone opened their mouths wide in shock. A golden radiance emanated from Ling Han’s body, transforming into a shield that protected him within, forcefully withstanding Yuwen Hou’s attack.

How was this possible?

Wasn’t Ling Han only in the Blood Transformation Tier? Judging from his declining blood and Qi, as well as his white hair, it was obvious that he had expended too much of his life force, which was why he needed the Treasured Fruit of Life.

A Blood Transformation Tier cultivator in such a weakened state could actually withstand an attack that was strong enough to reach the Enlightenment Tier?

How could this be believed!

“Treasured armor!” Yuwen Hou gritted his teeth. He was the person involved, so he naturally knew that this golden light was not emitted from Ling Han’s body, but from his clothes.

Originally, it looked very ordinary, but now, it was different. Mysterious patterns appeared.

This was the Precipice Formation!

‘How was it drawn?1

Ling Han’s own blood could be regarded as the “ink” of the Extreme Bone Tier. Although it still couldn’t contend against the battle prowess of the Enlightenment Tier, it was more than enough to withstand it for ten seconds. The preparations he had made in the past few days were to create the Precipice Formation.

“One, two, three, four…” Ling Han was still counting down.

Yuwen Hou roared loudly, and attacked Ling Han with all his might. Cracks instantly appeared on the shield formed by the golden light, but it did not shatter for a moment. Instead, it could hold on for a while.

“Seven, eight, nine, ten!” Ling Han counted. Even if he counted to ten, the golden shield still hadn’t shattered, but it was close to.

But he did last another ten seconds.

The Precipice Formation lived up to its name.

Yuwen Hou stopped what he was doing as a million thoughts ran through his mind.

Was there any other person like him?

What kind of lousy opponent was this? This opponent wouldn’t even fight him with strength. Instead, he used formations first, and then treasured armour. Although each of them could only withstand his attacks temporarily, who asked him to say that as long as Ling Han could withstand it for ten seconds, it would be enough?

This was called digging one’s own grave.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Thank you for letting me win.”

Let me win your sister!

Yuwen Hou complained in his heart. But he was in the Inscription Tier, how could he have the nerve to ask a Blood Transformation Tier to fight him head-on?

Wasn’t this shameless?

Ling Han first put away the Treasured Fruits, then looked at the Fourth Prince of the Demon Race, and asked, “Do you want to play one last round?

The Fourth Prince of the Demon Race’s face darkened. He now knew that Ling Han was here to cheat them out of the Treasured Fruits of Life. If he agreed, this fellow would definitely use some strange technique.

Do you really think I’m a fool?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “How about this? This time, I guarantee that I will only use my own strength. How about it? I won’t use formations, precious tools, or rely on external forces.”

“Really?” the Fourth Prince of the Demon Race asked. He was really unwilling to be tricked by Ling Han so many times.

“Of course,” Ling Han said with a smile. “However, the stakes this time will be much higher. You have to bet all the remaining Treasured Fruits of Life, and if I fail, I’ll return all the things that I won from you previously to you.”

On the other hand, the Fourth Prince of the Demon Race was a little hesitant, because Ling Han appeared to be too confident.

“Fourth Prince, agree to his request!” Yuwen Hou interjected. He did not believe that Ling Han could withstand his attacks for ten seconds without external help.

“Alright!” The Fourth Prince of the Demon Race nodded slowly..
