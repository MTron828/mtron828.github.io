Chapter 2241: Uniting against an external enemy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Meng Feicheng, Liu Sanbian, and the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan broke into an intense battle.

The Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan were all Fifth Secret emperor tiers. Though there was indeed a great gap between emperor tier and monarch tier, firstly, they had an advantage in numbers, and secondly, they were birthed by the same mother, and nurtured in the same womb, so they had a mental connection. When they worked together, it was like they were one person, and were much stronger than any nine other Fifth Secret emperor tiers that worked together. The nine of them could be considered as one person.

The “three” people battled intensely, all wanting to suppress the other two contenders so they could take the Origin Magic Cube for their own.

Perhaps they were not fully aware of the effects of the Origin Magic Cube, but just knowing the slightest bit about it would cause them to scrabble madly over it.

Ling Han watched from the sidelines, in no rush to make his own move.

As the “three” great elites fought fiercely, they consumed beast meat to replenish their power of Regulation, but this was completely unable to make ends meet. A decline was already appearing in their battle prowess.

They were all anxious, yet there was nothing they could do. When they had battled to such an extent, there was already no way out for them.

“Hehe, so this is the character of ants from a lower dimension?” A cold laugh rang out, and a strange creature appeared. He had the form of a praying mantis, but was innumerable times larger than normal, and was comparable to the size of a bull. He was completely black, his eyes massive and occupying at least half of his head.

Upon a closer look, his eyes were compound eyes, and looked like they were filled with stars, flashing with the light of Regulations.

His cultivation level was not clear, but the aura exuding from him was incredibly powerful, causing Meng Feicheng and the others to involuntarily stop their battle.

A prodigy of the Foreign Realm!

Ling Han was slightly surprised. “Dimension”? This was a novel term. He had never heard anyone of the Celestial Realm use this term before, but this creature was communicating its intent through divine sense, so there was no possibility of hearing it wrong.

Furthermore, the Celestial Realm was actually a lower dimension? Then was the Foreign Realm a higher dimension?

“Bug from the Foreign Realm, do you seek death?” Meng Feicheng shouted, glaring at this mantis-like creature from the Foreign Realm.

Though the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan and Liu Sanbian did not speak, they, too, had redirected their animosity towards this outsider.

Since childhood, they had been taught that they were incompatible with the Foreign Realm, and there was no possibility of compromise or peaceful terms between the two sides. It would either be the Celestial Realm being destroyed, or the Foreign Realm would have to be expelled, and the connecting point of the two Realms had to be sealed off.

The mantis bared his mouth in a grin. He was clearly bug-shaped, but was incredibly human-like as he retorted, “I am Kuhaad, a descendant of the glorious Shadow Race! Though this Origin Magic Cube is not considered all that valuable in our dimension, it is still a treasure anyhow. Kuhaad shall accept it.”

“Just because you say so, is it yours?” Liu Sanbian scoffed.

“Trash of the lower dimension, could it be that you have forgotten your terrible defeats in the two instances of martial arts tournament?” Kuhaad laughed raucously. “Trash like you all are at the lowest grade of a lower dimension, and have completely no idea just how many powerful races there are in this Dimensional Universe.”

He paused, and then continued, “Compared to our Shadow Race, you are practically trash among trash.”

Ling Han listened from the sidelines, and couldn’t help but feel secretly shocked. Though it had only been a few scattered words from Kuhaad, he seemed to have pried into a great many secrets. However, he was still very unfamiliar with many of his words. What was the concept of dimension? And what did Dimensional Universe mean?

“Small Tower, do you know?” he asked secretly.

“This is probably a maniac,” Small Tower stated calmly.

Ling Han did not think that Kuhaad was a maniac. On the contrary, this guy was really strong, and the aura that seeped out from him caused even him to feel a chill.

“Kill this bug of the Foreign Realm!” the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan exclaimed in unison.

“All right!” Meng Feicheng and Liu Sanbian also nodded in succession.

“Want to kill Kuhaad?” Kuhaad smirked coldly. “I am at the peak of Eighth Lotus, which is equivalent to your Immortal Palace Tier. However, I have come from the Rare Earth Dimension, which is uncountable times higher in grade than this lowest-grade dimension of yours. In a battle of equal battle prowess, it will naturally be one-sided as well.”

With a battle cry, he raised a limb, and struck at Liu Sanbian and the others. Suddenly, a massive back-colored insect leg descended from the skies. it was covered with inverted spikes. They were like sharp weapons, with multiple black seals covering their surface, and were inconceivably frightening.

Liu Sanbian and the others all smirked coldly, and each made their move, attacking Kuhaad in unison.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

In this four-sided great battle, though Kuhaad had been boasting very greatly, his battle prowess was actually just comparable to that of Liu Sanbian or Meng Feicheng. Logically, he would definitely have lost in a battle of one against three.

However, he possessed one of Ling Han’s abilities, and that was being especially resilient against attack.

His outer shell was like a supreme Celestial Tool. No matter how Liu Sanbian and the others attacked, it was still undamaged. Instead, he managed to take advantage of any openings, and countered repeatedly, forcing Liu Sanbian and the others into a tizzy.

Ling Han watched, and realization dawned on him. It was no wonder that the two sparring contests between the Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm had both ended in terrible defeat. If all the cultivators of the Foreign Realm had such astonishing defenses, then they naturally had an absolute advantage in a one-on-one situation.

He couldn’t help but wonder if he would be able to pierce through Kuhaad’s defenses. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Great Clash of Source Powers should be able to do the job, but he had already given up on the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, so it was naturally no longer possible for him to use this kind of secret technique again.

If he used Fists of Fury, would its power be enough?

Ling Han couldn’t help but doubt the Divine Demon Sword. However, this Pseudo-Celestial Tool was still on the level of Four Stars, so it should be completely ineffective against Kuhaad’s defenses. It could not be helped. For the sake of advancing to the pinnacle of alchemy, the savings Ling Han had accumulated all these years had all been spent on purchasing the ingredients for alchemy, and he had not had any chance to upgrade the Divine Demon Sword.

He was just making a comparison when he saw that Kuhaad was already enjoying the upper hand.

It was not because Kuhaad’s strength was clearly superior, but rather that Liu Sanbian and the others had first been pursuing Ling Han, and then they had fought among themselves fiercely, expending too much of their power of Regulation. They were already close to the end of their line, so how could they hold up against the energetic and lively Kuhaad.

“Weak, really too weak!” Kuhaad laughed coldly, his tone filled with utter contempt. As his six legs swept out, they were like six Celestial Tools dancing around and striking, their destructive power incredibly terrifying. “The lowest-grade dimension can only nurture such trash.”

The eyes of Liu Sanbian and the others were all spitting fire in their fury, but how could it be that they could explain to him that they had long since been exhausted from a previous battle, and now it was completely not their true, genuine strength?

“Die!” Kuhaad was merciless, planning to eliminate all 11 people of the Celestial Realm.

“Ancestral Teachings!” Meng Feicheng suddenly exclaimed loudly.

Liu Sanbian and the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan all faltered, and then their expressions became solemn. “When encountering the Foreign Realm, we must battle to the death, and must absolutely not retreat!”

Meng Feicheng nodded. “The Origin Magic Cube has great implications, and must definitely not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Foreign Realm. Hence, even if it means that we have to battle to the bitter end and die, we must still cause enough of a delay so that our own people can come.”

“Yes!” Liu Sanbian and the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan all nodded, dismissing any ideas of fleeing.

The 11 of them all drummed up their remaining courage, determined to suppress Kuhaad. However, their present strength was really not all that great, and could not threaten Kuhaad at all. Instead, their blood was spurting in all directions from his attacks.

At first, Ling Han had planned to take advantage of the crisis for his personal gain, but seeing the actions of Meng Feicheng and the others at these final moments, his heart was moved.

Though the way these people handled matters displeased him, at least in terms of righteousness, they still had grasp of their virtuous cause.

Internal matters could be dealt with among themselves behind closed doors, but now it was the time to resist an external enemy.

Xiu, Ling Han’s figure flashed, and he had already appeared in front of Meng Feicheng, shooting out a punch at Kuhaad..
