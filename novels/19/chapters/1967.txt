Chapter 1968: Toad

For the sake of the true meaning of the great dao, the Wide Prosperity Heaven and the Calm Peace Heaven temporarily put aside their differences. They decided to team up.

Before coming here, everyone had already made the necessary preparations. For example, Yan Xianlu, Liu Jie, and the others had already prepared some sort of formation that could greatly increase their battle prowess. This was in order to rival Yi, Shu Yarong, and the other freakish prodigies.

Now, however, this monster at the heaven soul was definitely far more powerful than Yi, Shu Yarong, and the other supreme prodigies. Thus, they had to team up to battle against it.

In fact, Ling Han still possessed a trump card. That was the poisonous fruit of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo. What did it matter that this was a monster at the heaven soul? A single drop of juice from the poisonous fruit would immediately render it dead.

However, Ling Han didn’t want to use it now. After all, it was one of his biggest trump cards. As such, it didn’t make sense to use it now.

Everyone gathered together, yet they were still somewhat separated into smaller groups, each of which was in its own formation. Thus, everyone still seemed disorganized and dispersed.

Shu Yarong frowned, and said, “What’s going on with Tang Minglong? He still hasn’t come yet!”

He was someone who was as powerful as her. If Tang Minglong were here, their chance of success would be much greater.

However, they couldn’t wait forever. Anyhow, with the addition of Ling Han and Hu Niu, they could somewhat make up for the loss of Tang Minglong.

At least, this was what Shu Yarong thought.

“Listen to my command,” Shu Yarong said. She was going to command this battle, and this caused the Empress and Hu Niu to feel extremely displeased. Why did they have to listen to her?

However, Ling Han didn’t care much about this. This was only temporary cooperation, so it wouldn’t matter who acted as the leader. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Go!”

Shu Yarong took the lead and charged forward, slashing with her sword as she did so. A dazzling burst of light surged forward, carrying with it boundless and undulating Regulations. It was as if heaven and earth were going to be forcefully sliced apart as the brilliant Sword Ray left a trail of darkness in its wake.

The others also moved, and almost 100 prodigies unleashed their attacks in unison.

“Croak!” The toad had initially been sprawled over the stone tablet and lazily sleeping. When the prodigies entered some boundary, however, it suddenly opened its sanguine red eyes which were filled with a boundless aura of murder.

It shook its body.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The sky was instantly filled with spikes, which rained down on the prodigies.

Each spike possessed a terrifying murderous aura, and it was as if they were paramount Celestial Tools that could obliterate all matter.

Ling Han didn’t know whether these spikes could truly obliterate all matter. However, they could definitely kill those at the fifth severance with ease!

He had severely underestimated this toad.

Ling Han hurriedly dashed to the side to protect the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou. At the same time, he also channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, raising his defenses to the max.

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

At least seven spikes smashed into him in unison, unleashing their Regulation of Slaughter as they did so. Waves of black light swarmed, and they yearned to burn through Ling Han’s defenses so that they could forcefully impale him. However, by channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, Ling Han could definitely defend against attacks from those at the heaven soul.

The spikes were unable to penetrate Ling Han’s defenses, yet the colossal momentum that they possessed easily lifted him up and sent him flying.

Boom!

Ling Han and the others crashed into a mountain wall behind them.

Rumble...

Broken rocks and dust rained down. Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others finally came to a stop. However, apart from Ling Han, the three women all spat a mouthful of blood.

Even though they hadn’t been directly hit by the attack, the collision just then had still wounded them significantly. In fact, only Ling Han was unscathed thanks to the protection of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

‘As expected of a monster at the heaven soul. Its attack is far too terrifying.’

However, this was only Ling Han’s view. As for the others...

Just then, Ling Han had neither the time nor effort to concentrate on them. Glancing over now, what he saw was a large group of wounded cultivators.

Some had been pierced in the abdomen, while others had been stabbed through the arms or legs. As for those whose divine senses had been breached, it was almost certain that they were dead. Even if they weren’t, their expressions were as grim as could be. They were all ingesting treasured medicines or using other kinds of life-saving treasures to suppress the murderous aura of the spikes.

Being at the heaven soul, this murderous aura would have a crushing power after entering their bodies. It could almost instantly breach their minds and obliterate their divine senses.

Thus, for the sake of their lives, what couldn’t these prodigies sacrifice?

This was a miserable scene. There were hundreds of emperor tiers and monarch tiers, yet they couldn’t even make it near the toad, and seven of them had already been killed. In addition, dozens had been severely wounded, and only fewer than 10 had escaped with minor wounds.

Shu Yarong had naturally only sustained minor wounds. Even though she had led the charge, her title as the second-strongest Severing Mundane Tier elite of the Wide Prosperity Heaven was no exaggeration. Her battle prowess was extremely astounding—at the very least, her defenses were definitely freakish.

However, she certainly wasn’t feeling smug at this moment. She was well aware of her own abilities, so there was naturally no need to feel smug. The problem was: how were they going to deal with this toad? It was far too powerful!

In fact, she could dispose of this toad all by herself. However, she would need to pay a significant price. Moreover, it would also render her defenseless for a short while. Thus, she naturally couldn’t choose this option, especially since there were so many people around. This was unless she could guarantee her safety.

However, whom here could she trust?

Anyhow, what could they do now?

The precious treasure was right before them, so there was no reason to abandon it just like that. In the outside world, those at the heaven soul wouldn’t have the right to refer to themselves as elites. Only those at or above the Immortal Palace Tier had this right. Here, however, a monster at the heaven soul was much like an invincible being. Even monarch tiers were helpless against it.

“How about... we look for the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood first?” someone suggested.

“Alright, then you go!” someone immediately said in retort.

No one was willing to leave at this moment. After all, they had no idea where the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood was located. This was a colossal valley, so finding the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood would be no easy task. Moreover, even if they found it, whether or not they could receive acknowledgment from the Source Power of heaven and earth was another matter altogether.

This was in stark contrast to the true meaning of the great dao. Upon obtaining it... No, as long as they could carefully observe it, they could definitely increase their own strength and benefit forever.

These prodigies were no fools. Which of them didn’t understand this?

“Let Niu try!” Hu Niu said as she wiped the blood from the corners of her mouth. Her eyes were filled with a dangerous glint.

This toad actually dared to wound her? This truly caused her to feel enraged.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Don’t. Leave your trump card until later.” He strode forward, deciding to use the poisonous fruit of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo.

He had already decided on this earlier. If their cooperation were successful, he would continue to hide the poisonous fruit of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo. If it weren’t successful, however, he would then use this trump card. After all, it was always best to leave one’s trump card until last. In any case, he was intent on obtaining the true meaning of the Regulation of Slaughter.

Meanwhile, the toad didn’t take advantage of the situation to attack them. As long as they left that certain area, it would pay them no more heed. It would lazily lie back down to sleep.

However, once Ling Han entered that area again, it immediately opened its eyes to stare at him.

Xiu!

It leaped forward at an astonishing speed, arriving before Ling Han in a flash. This clearly wasn’t teleportation, yet it achieved almost the exact same result. Its blood-red tongue lashed out like a lively spear, aiming to strike Ling Han’s face.

Pa!

This attack was far too quick and far too intense. Ling Han had no time to dodge, and his face was immediately struck.

A searing pain instantly shot across his face. It was as if the Regulation of Slaughter had transformed into a drill that was carving away at his face. Moreover, this was already thanks to the protection of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Otherwise, this attack would have definitely annihilated his face.

‘Now, it’s my turn to attack!’

Ling Han slashed down with his sword, yet he felt absolutely no resistance. As it turned out, he had already been sent flying by the toad’s attack.

Hu Niu and the Empress immediately dashed forward to catch him.

“Ling Han, your face has been smeared with toad spit, so should Niu kiss you in the future or not?” Hu Niu asked in a vexed voice.

If she kissed him, that would seem far too disgusting. If she didn’t kiss him, however... how could she endure this? Thus, she felt extremely vexed at this moment.
