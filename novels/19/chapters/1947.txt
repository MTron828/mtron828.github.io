Chapter 1948: I’ve Come From the Calm Peace Heaven

Liu Jie waved at Ling Han, and said, “Brother Ling, come, sit!”

Even though the overall level of cultivation in the Wide Prosperity Heaven was higher, there were still only very few monarch tiers. Thus, each of them was worth becoming friends with.

Ling Han nodded in acknowledgment, and he was accompanied by Liu Jie to the location of the banquet.

This was an elegant garden, and it was filled with all kinds of mysterious flowers and peculiar plants. There was also a pond in the middle in which there was a twin lotus that was giving off a refreshing fragrance. From time to time, some carps would also swim to the surface of the pond, and appear in the gaps between the lotus leaves.

“Huh? This is a Heaven Fortune Lotus!” Ling Han exclaimed as he saw the twin lotus. He had already committed all of the Celestial medicines in the world to memory, so he immediately recognized this lotus. However, an expression of disappointment quickly spread across his face, and he said, “However, its medicinal age is only one billion or so years, so it can only qualify as a Pseudo-Celestial medicine.”

Heaven Fortune Lotuses had to grow for at least five billion years before they could absorb enough Regulations of heaven and earth and become Celestial medicines. If they hadn’t passed this age, they could only be considered as Pseudo-Celestial medicines.

Of course, Pseudo-Celestial medicines were already incredibly valuable. Each of them could sell for an astronomical amount of Star Stones.

However, few people would be willing to sell their Celestial medicines for Star Stones. Generally speaking, people would trade them for other valuable materials or Celestial medicines, or perhaps some high-level celestial techniques.

Liu Jie had initially been wearing a proud smile. Generally speaking, only Celestial Kings had the right to plant and nurture Celestial medicines. Yet, he already possessed one while still at the Severing Mundane Tier. Just how astonishing was this? However, Ling Han’s next remark made it seem as if he didn’t think much about this Pseudo-Celestial medicine. This caused him to feel extremely vexed.

Liu Han instantly held her hand to her mouth and chuckled. She had initially viewed Ling Han in a very bad light. However, he had proved that he was a mighty monarch tier!

Monarch tiers were naturally proud people. Moreover, Ling Han was not only a cultivation prodigy, but he also possessed incredible talent in alchemy. Thus, she naturally viewed him with increased respect.

When viewing someone else, if one possessed a mindset of dislike, they would definitely see that person as more and more dislikable. Even if that person spoke beautiful words, one would feel that they were trying to please others with claptrap. However, once this impression was fixed, they would see that person in a completely different light. The latter would seem to be more and more likable.

Otherwise, Liu Han definitely wouldn’t have chuckled upon hearing Ling Han’s words. Instead, she would have thought that he was putting on airs.

“Brother Ling, your standards are truly so high!” Liu Jie said with a shake of his head. He was clearly very speechless.

Everyone sat down, and there were naturally servants bustling about to serve them with dish after dish of delicacies.

A Holy Son was hosting guests, so the quality of this banquet naturally wouldn’t be low. The meat was Celestial Beast meat, and the wine was celestial medicine wine. Of course, the Celestial Beasts were only at the third or fourth severance, and the celestial wines only possessed a single leaf from Celestial medicines. With how valuable Celestial medicines were, they naturally couldn’t add too much of it.

Even so, everyone was still filled with delight as they enjoyed this sumptuous meal. If it weren’t for embarrassment, they truly would shout for another serving.

Liu Jie didn’t speak during the meal, and only when everyone was almost finished eating did he say, “I invited everyone over for a very important matter.”

“Dare I ask, Holy Son, what is this important matter?” someone naturally asked.

Liu Jie pondered for a moment before saying, “A Mystery Realm of heaven and earth has appeared on the border between the Calm Peace Heaven and our Wide Prosperity Heaven. Inside this Mystery Realm... is a Source Power of heaven and earth.”

‘What? Source Power of heaven and earth?!’

This instantly captured everyone’s attention, and they all wore expressions of emotion and eagerness.

Source Powers of heaven and earth were of the Celestial King Tier. Upon obtaining one, one could be regarded as invincible among their own cultivation level. If they, the king tiers and emperor tiers, obtained one, their battle prowess would also elevate by an entire level. Perhaps king tiers would become emperor tiers, and perhaps emperor tiers would become monarch tiers. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“This Source Power of heaven and earth is called the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood. However, not only has our Wide Prosperity Heaven received this news, but the Calm Peace Heaven has also received this news.

“A Celestial King has deduced that this Mystery Realm of heaven and earth will open in about one year from now. Meanwhile, the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood will also finish maturing at about the same time. It will become a genuine Source Power of heaven and earth, and it will be ready for harvest.

“However, only those at the Severing Mundane Tier will be able to enter the Mystery Realm of heaven and earth. At that time, the Severing Mundane Tier cultivators from the two heavens will definitely engage in an intense competition.”

Upon hearing this, many people wore expressions of disdain.

“The Calm Peace Heaven? Are they worthy of competing with us?”

“I’ve heard that the Calm Peace Heaven doesn’t even have a single monarch tier. Any random monarch tier from our heaven can completely obliterate them.”

“That’s right. At most, they’ll only be heading over to enjoy the atmosphere. Only the monarch tiers from our Wide Prosperity Heaven will be true competitors for this Source Power.”

In the recent several hundred million years, the Wide Prosperity Heaven had suddenly experienced rapid growth. Not only did it shake off the title of weakest, but it even pulled further and further ahead of the Calm Peace Heaven. It was showing signs of entering the low-mid quartile.

Thus, the younger generation of the Wide Prosperity Heaven was extremely proud and haughty. They believed that the Calm Peace Heaven would only have a few king tiers at most.

Ling Han stroked his chin, and said, “Sorry, but I’m from the Calm Peace Heaven.”

His words instantly rendered everyone speechless.

How was this possible?

A prodigy such as Ling Han was actually nurtured by the Calm Peace Heaven?

“Brother Ling, you’re so good at telling jokes!”

“That’s right! A prodigy such as Brother Ling is definitely the pride of our Wide Prosperity Heaven!”

Many people immediately expressed their doubt. They all shook their heads.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered refuting them, and he simply replied with a smile.

Liu Jie hurriedly waved his hand, and said, “No matter what, since our Universal Clouds Sect is aware of this matter, we naturally have to give it our all to fight for the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood.”

“The Holy Son is right. We definitely have to win this Source Power of heaven and earth for Guanhua City!” many people shouted. Regardless of whether this was possible or not, they would naturally have to sing praises to the Holy Son first.

Liu Jie nodded, and continued, “Source Powers of heaven and earth won’t necessarily follow one just because they’re powerful. Source Powers are Celestial King Tier existences, so they naturally have their own requirements when seeking a master. Thus, our goal is to arrive before the Source Power of heaven and earth so that we can be considered by it.

“We only have one opportunity. If a Source Power of heaven and earth can’t find a suitable master upon birth, it will escape through heaven and earth, and vanish from this heaven. At that time, only a Celestial King will be able to capture it. Thus, failure will signify that we have to wait for countless more years until a second opportunity appears.

“In the beginning, I planned on inviting five people to form a Seven Star Dazzling Moon Formation with my younger sister and me. That way, we could increase our battle prowess. However, since Brother Ling has come, I believe that the three of us will be more than powerful enough to overcome any challenge.”

With a team of three monarch tiers, what challenges couldn’t they overcome?

Ling Han felt slightly apologetic, and he said, “I’m genuinely from the Calm Peace Heaven, so I can only politely turn down Brother Liu’s kind proposal.”

“Hahahaha!” Ling Han’s words instantly elicited loud laughter from many people. They felt that Ling Han was hilarious.

Ling Han was truly rendered speechless. Why did no one ever believe him when he spoke the truth?

“Brother Ling, you genuinely don’t want to team up with us?” Liu Jie asked with a serious expression. If it were just him and Liu Han, they wouldn’t have much confidence in overcoming their competition. After all, the top three monarch tiers in the Wide Prosperity Heaven were extremely freakish.

Only with a team of three monarch tiers did he have enough confidence to rival the top monarch tiers in the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

However, this was simply rivaling, not defeating!

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ve already stated my reason very clearly.”

Liu Jie was also doubtful about Ling Han’s claim that he was from the Calm Peace Heaven. After all, he held a deep-rooted belief that the Calm Peace Heaven was an extremely weak heaven. Thus, he tried to persuade Ling Han again, saying, “Brother Ling, if you’re afraid that we might conflict and develop animosity over the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, then there’s truly no need to worry.

“I’ve already said. The Source Power of heaven and earth will choose its own master, so we’re simply fighting for an opportunity to arrive before this precious treasure so that we can be considered by it.”

His voice was filled with sincerity.
