Chapter 2005: Overflow

Ling Han had really not expected it. These seven people did not have much strength, but they were actually all rich people.

Each of them purchased an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, and threw out 10,000,000 Star Stones without the slightest heartache, which filled Ling Han with self-doubt. Was he really an alchemist? He seemed to be very poor.

He and the three women continued their advance.

Very quickly, a legend spread around in this ocean—when you were completely off guard, a person would appear quietly, and ask if you wanted to buy anything— no, Yang Soul Stones.

After touring around the Yang Soul Ocean for over 100 years, Ling Han had sold off all the Yang Soul Stones, and after so many years, he had completely stabilized his cultivation level, and his battle prowess had become increasingly frightening.

“It is time to return.”

Ling Han and his group floated to the ocean’s surface, and searched for the way to return.

At this time, they could see a considerable number of people had also emerged from the water as they, too, searched for the way to return.

Breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier would only need a month’s time. Thus, the majority of people would only attempt to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier at the last moments. The time before that would all be spent on gathering Yang Soul Stones to obtain the highest grade of Yang Soul Stone possible.

Now that it was close to the time for their return, it was natural that most people would commence their return. Those remaining would be close too, probably within the next month or two.

“Ling Han!” A furious roar was heard, world-shaking in its volume.

Ling Han stopped, and turned around to see that Ma Tongguang was presently approaching rapidly. Behind him was Lu Xianming, who had fallen behind by several hundred meters.

The two of them... had both broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier.

At first, Lu Xianming was completely unable to compare to Ma Tongguang, but once they had broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier, even the gap between monarch tier and king tier would shrink considerably. At least, Lu Xianming would no longer be left so far behind by Ma Tongguang that he could not even catch a glimpse of the latter.

“Oh, it’s you two, trash,” Ling Han said carelessly.

T-trash?

Immediately, Ma Tongguang’s fury spiked madly. He had broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier, and had broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone at that. This was very extraordinary. Thus, he had developed a high opinion of himself, and thought that there would be few that could compare to him.

Ling Han?

Yes, when he had been in the fifth severance, the other was indeed stronger than he was, but Ma Tongguang had broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, which had definitely left the former behind in his dust.

By this time, he no longer had the interest to feign civility with Ling Han. He had directly turned hostile.

“You arrogant lowlife, die!” Ma Tongguang’s figure charged out, his right hand spread open. Xiu, xiu, xiu, countless chains of Regulations instantly shot out towards Ling Han.

Behind him, Lu Xianming showed an evil smile.

He had personally witnessed Ma Tongguang breaking through, and was deeply aware of just how strong the latter was, and he could only admire and worship him.

And now Ma Tongguang was moving in fury, so he would definitely be able to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. When Ma Tongguang was in the fifth severance, he was already inferior to Ling Han, and now that the latter had broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier with a perfect purple grade Yang Soul Stone, not only had the gap between Ma Tongguang and himself not shrunk down, it had instead become even wider.

He smiled faintly, and swiped out casually.

Pa!

Ma Tongguang immediately sustained a slap. The celestial chains of Regulations that filled the skies were also all shattered by this strike, and turned into bits of power of Regulation before returning to the heaven and earth.

‘What?!’

Ma Tongguang was dazed, his whole mind filled with disbelief. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He actually was still not on par with Ling Han?

How could this be? He had broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone.

For this, he had even used a rare treasure that could cause serious injury to Earth Soul-level marine creature. He had almost expended this rare treasure fully to finally gather 200 blue grade Yang Soul Stones, which he then fused and refined into a single indigo grade Yang Soul Stone.

Could it be that Ling Han, too, possessed this kind of rare treasure?

“Hey, Brother Liu, you have also broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier?”

“Of course!”

“Oh, right, what Yang Soul Stone did you use to break through?”

“I fear I will scare you if I tell you, indigo grade!”

“What, you also had an indigo grade?”

“Yi, yours is indigo grade too?”

In the distance, a conversation between two people was heard, causing Ma Tongguang to turn around numbly. When he saw these two people, his mouth involuntarily gaped.

That was because these two could just barely be considered as king tiers. He had seen them before, and with his memory, he naturally would not forget whatever he had seen.

They were only king tiers, yet had actually broken through with indigo grade Yang Soul Stones?

Then what was he so proud about?

“Ah, Young Master Ling!”

Those two people spotted Ling Han as well, and hurriedly ran over, thanking him profusely.

“Young Master Ling, really, thank you very much. If you had not sold indigo grade Yang Soul Stones to us, we would only have been able to break through with green grade Yang Soul Stones at most.”

“I will definitely remember this kindness forever. In the future, as long as you have any command, I will definitely not refuse!”

After the two of them thanked him profusely, they left.

Ma Tongguang’s lips twitched madly. What? The indigo grade Yang Soul Stones these two had were actually bought from Ling Han? Then, Ling Han had to have broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone. Otherwise, how could he possibly have extra Yang Soul Stones to sell?

To say he had used a green grade, or blue grade Yang Soul Stone to break through, yet had left better grade Yang Soul Stones to sell to others, wouldn’t that be an idiot?

“Grandmaster Ling!” Another person rushed over, and bowed to Ling Han. “Thank you for Grandmaster Ling’s profound favor, allowing me to break through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone.”

In quick succession, there came another, and another, and another....

Ma Tongguang was already completely numb. In his eyes, obtaining an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone was as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and even a monarch tier as strong as he still had to use a rare treasure from the Western Celestial Realm to be able to obtain it. What right did these pieces of trash here have to do the same?

Lu Xianming was also gaping in shock. He had benefited considerably with his association with Ma Tongguang. When the latter hunted and obtained green grade Yang Soul Stones, he did not even bother to collect them, and thus they had fallen into his pocket.

Thus, he had fused 200 green grade Yang Soul Stones into a blue grade one, and thus broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier.

Lu Xianming had thought that he had gotten a powerful backer, but now?

He quietly pulled one of them aside and asked, and almost passed out when he got his answers.

The price was only a mere 10,000,000 Star Stones!

Lu Xianming was a Two-Star Alchemist, and also used to be a Holy Son of Alchemy City. His wealth was definitely several hundred million, so taking out 10,000,000 was only a piece of cake for him, but now, because he had followed the wrong person, he would feel eternal regret.

He was filled with hate and fury!

Why, why did Ling Han have to oppose him?

‘It’s already enough that you had obtained so many indigo grade Yang Soul Stones, but why did you have to take them out? Everyone has broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, so what feeling of superiority would you have left?’

Lu Xianming could not comprehend. How could there be such a person? Ling Han was practically a weirdo.

...What he did not know, though, was that Ling Han had actually broken through with a purple grade Yang Soul Stone. However, even if Ling Han had broken through with an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, he would not have been concerned, either. That was because he was filled with confidence in himself. If the two of them were in the same situation, he would definitely be stronger.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You two clowns have been jumping around for so long, so it is about time I send you on your way to the afterlife!”

Without waiting for Ma Tongguang to speak again, his figure had already charged out like a dragon bursting out of the ocean vehemently into the skies.

“Don’t even think about it!” Ma Tongguang gritted his teeth, and drew out a furled scroll. He suddenly unfurled it, and most of it was blank. Only the last section had a few seals. It was not discernible what exactly was written, but possessed an overbearing air that could suppress the dome of heaven.

This was a treasure that had been bestowed by a Celestial King. However, the Celestial King Tier was too strong, and a scroll of this quality was definitely incapable of bearing the power of a Celestial King. Thus, the might had declined considerably.

Even so, this could still easily erase the life of an Earth Soul elite.

“Die!” Ma Tongguang shook the scroll strongly, and the remaining seven seals suddenly lit up at the same time.
