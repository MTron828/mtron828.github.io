1276 Tool and User Become One

Liu Shi wanted to stop Ling Han, but he was too late.

How astonishing was Ling Han’s speed when he was using the Star Plucking Step? As his sword swept part, millions of sword projections swept out. The whole space was filled with fierce flashes of Sword Qi.

“Aaah!”

Terrible cries rang out. With that one blow, five of the seven members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace had fallen, and aside from Liu Shi, the last remaining person had also suffered a considerably injury. There was a very deep wound in his right ribs.

Liu Shi’s eyes couldn’t help but widen. He was both furious and shocked; how could this brat’s brat be so terrifying?

This was definitely battle prowess on the level of the consummate level, only slightly weaker than himself—he was in the middle stage of the consummate level, and had not reached the true peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier yet.

It was enough that he was cultivating at such a rapid pace, but more importantly, his battle prowess was still so strong. Couldn’t he allow others some way to survive?

How could a lowly commoner that came from a small world possibly have such natural talent, fated opportunities, and good fortune?

He couldn’t understand it in the slightest.

The only other living person was also covered with cold sweat. Presently, he was filled with lingering fear. If it were not for the fact that he’d reacted that slight bit faster just now, he would’ve probably shared the fate of his five companions that were lying on the ground, their corpses gradually becoming cooler.

“Little beast, what a cruel heart you have!” Liu Shi felt like his heart was bleeding. How much did the sect have to sacrifice to nurture a Sun Moon Tier disciple? Especially when they were advancing from Mountain River Tier to Sun Moon Tier. That had been achieved by diluting the effects of the Realm Pill and distributing it to these disciples.

They could only concoct a few pills every 10,000 years, and they would have to be divided equally among the Five Sects as well. After distribution, each sect would only have a single pill. And from the moment Ling Han opened the sky, even this one pill was no longer ensured.

Though it was not discernible yet, the Five Sects would definitely begin going downhill. Every single Sun Moon Tier disciple was incredibly precious.

Ling Han brandished the Divine Demon Sword, the sword’s blade like snow, without the slightest bit of blood on it. He coldly said, “What a joke. All of you are filled with killing intent towards me, and it is only allowed that you kill me and not the other way round?”

Liu Shi naturally knew that he had spoken nonsense, but what else could he say in his rage?

Of course, this was also because he was used to being in a lofty position. He automatically placed himself on a high spot, and reprimanded those he deemed below himself.

“You have to use your blood to repay your debts!” Liu Shi took in a deep breath. Though this young man was frighteningly young, his abilities were astonishing, and he had no choice but to be extremely cautious.

He summoned his own God Tool. It was a white jade tower, and only had seven levels. The moment it appeared, it shone with astonishing light. It was as if he had plucked a sun out of the skies; it was incredibly blinding.

“Yi!” Ling Han was surprised. He channeled the Eye of Truth, and saw it very clearly. “This tower of yours... contains one of your Suns and Moons!”

He had heard of the practice of using one’s own self to refine the tool, but directly fusing one’s Sun and Moon into his God Tool? This was the first time he had seen something like that. Involuntarily, he became greatly interested.

Was this user and tool becoming as one?

“Destroy this tower!” Meanwhile, Small Tower transmitted a message through divine sense into his mind. It could not bear to see any tower-shaped precious Tools; the moment it saw one, it would become angered.

Ling Han naturally ignored it, and said, “Then I would really like to take a look.”

“You will!” Liu Shi said. “And the price will be your life!”

He summoned the precious tower, which cast shadow over Ling Han. Weng, the precious tower shone, multiple rays of light descending downwards. Every ray of light was like a fiery flame, filled with a frightening destructive ability, causing even the air itself to begin burning as crackling sounds rang out.

Liu Shi cultivated fire techniques, so his Sun and Moon was also like fiery flames. Now that they had been fused into the precious Tool, lending on the might of the God Tool, its might was also completely expressed.

Ling Han nodded internally. From a certain aspect, the combination of user and Tool was really a kind of grand move; its might was indeed very, very powerful. However, the disadvantage was also very obvious. This Sun and Moon had really been severed, so it would naturally affect himself, and he was destined to be incapable of reaching a higher cultivation level.

However, though it was not all the people of the Five Sects, at least 99% of them could not possibly break through to the Heavenly Body Tier, so why would they have to mind?

What they pursued was strength on the level of Sun Moon Tier.

Still, though user and Tool becoming one was powerful, could it compare to the Divine Demon Sword?

Ling Han sliced out towards the skies. Though it was merely one strike, the Divine Demon Sword showed its might, and once again sent out millions of sword projections, boosting the might of this attack by who knew how many times.

Pu, pu, pu, pu. The fiery light was slashed apart, and Sword Qi danced unhindered, just like a ruler descending onto his territory.

“Humph!” Liu Shi also knew that he could not possibly suppress Ling Han by merely depending on a precious tower. His body shot out, and a cold light swept past. There was a sword in his hand, and it stabbed out towards Ling Han.

This sword was similarly burning with soaring fierce flames, its brightness blinding to the eye.

Ling Han was shocked. This sword had shockingly also fused with a Sun and Moon!

This guy wouldn’t have fused all four of his Suns and Moons into God Tools, would he?

“Is there any more?” Ling Han asked with a smile. As he wielded his sword to parry his attacks, he was also very curious at the same time.

“As you wish!” Liu Shi smirked coldly. Weng, he summoned another divine sword, wielding the two swords in both hands. Meanwhile, the precious tower moved automatically, sending down divine flames onto Ling Han, planning to refine him by force.

This second sword had similarly fused with a Sun and Moon. Going by that account, his three Suns and Moons had been used for tool refinement, and he had not formed the fourth Moon. Otherwise, he might summon a fourth God Tool.

Ordinarily, it was not that the more God Tools there were, the better it was. That was because a cultivator had limited energy, and could not possibly allow all the God Tools to show their might completely, so he might as well concentrate fully on controlling one.

However, these three God Tools of Liu Shi’s had fused with a Sun and Moon from him. This was completely different. It was as if the God Tools had become a part of his body. He needed only split up a little of his concentration to control them, and all the three God Tools would be able to show their complete might.

True enough, small sects would have their own strengths. They did not have the technique to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier, so they used all means available to them to become stronger in the Sun Moon Tier.

Combining themselves with their Tools, and controlling three or even four God Tools all at once, was indeed a very good method. Though his own battle prowess would definitely be affected, he would have the might of another two God Tools, so he could completely compensate for his shortcoming in this manner.

Liu Shi charged over, his hands holding a Divine Sword each. Endless flames danced.

Ling Han stood solemnly, and in that instant when the other approached, he suddenly shot out the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique. Like an angry arrow, it shot towards Liu Shi.

“Wu!” Even if Liu Shi had already cultivated for several million years, and had nurtured his spirit to a very strong extent, he still grunted at this blow. He felt so much agony he almost used his hands to hold onto his head.

He knew that things were not good, and hurriedly stimulated the divine tower to protect him. The seven-floor treasured tower instantly enlarged many times, and descended down on his head, protecting him within it.

Ding!

True enough, when Ling Han’s slash reached, it sliced into the treasured tower, causing the body of the tower to shake madly. A few pieces of scrap metal had even been sliced off, but this blow was still blocked in the end.

After all, he was an old monster that had lived for more than 3,000,000 years, so his battle experience was really too bountiful. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ling Han did not strike further. Instead, he focused on the remaining person from the Heaven’s Sword Palace.
