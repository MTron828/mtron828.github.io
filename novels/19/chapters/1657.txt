Chapter 1658: Exchange

For elites, regrowing a severed arm was not a big deal, but Ling Han doing such a thing was to tell them that he had no scruples. He dared to tear off his arm now, and he would dare twist off his head next!

“What do you want?” the Zhao Tribe chief asked coldly, and they could clearly feel that he had seriously been angered by now.

Once they managed to retrieve the hostages, he would kill Ling Han!

...The war with the Lang Tribe could be set aside first; the Zhao Tribe had never been bullied like this by anyone before. If their anger could not be vented, then there would be no need for their survival any longer.

The other elders also had the same thoughts. ‘You can be as arrogant as you like now, but you will definitely be crying later.’

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then answered, “10 Saintly medicines!”

“Impossible!” The Zhao Tribe chief immediately shook his head. He had to be joking; did he think that Saintly medicines were as common as cabbages in the field? Even if there were abundant resources here, Saintly medicines were still incredibly precious.

Ling Han compromised, and said, “Seven. One in exchange for each person. You guys won’t say that a Saint is not even worth a Saintly medicine?”

The elites of the Zhao Tribe all knew that Saints meant Nine Rings elites. They naturally would not say no. In truth, even with the help of the great river, becoming a Ning Rings elite was still very, very difficult, and the chances of success would be considerably increased with the help of Saintly medicine.

“At most one!” the Zhao Tribe chief declared resolutely. There were only a total of three Saintly medicines in the tribe, and they were only Medium Saint Tier.

Ling Han looked at his expression, and knew that this was already his limit. Furthermore, if it was not because he was planning to snatch back the Saintly medicine after he rescued the hostages, he would not be willing to even make such a compromise.

He smiled, and said, “One Saintly medicine is too little, throw another six Saintly Materials into the bargain!”

F***!

The elites of the Zhao Tribe were all furious. ‘You really aren’t reserved at all, huh? You think Saintly medicine and Saintly Material are things that can be found anywhere?’

The Zhao Tribe chief paused for a while, yet still nodded, and answered, “Fine!”

He was unwilling to hand out more Saintly medicines because he worried that Ling Han would consume it. Then, even if they killed Ling Han, and split open his stomach, they would not be able to retrieve the Saintly medicine. The loss would be too massive, but Saintly Material was different. Would he be able to consume it?

Putting aside the question of consuming it, even if it was thrown onto the ground, it would be undamaged!

In that case, so what if they gave it to him? They would be giving in this moment, and getting it back in the next.

All the elders also immediately thought of this, and made no further objections.

“Lets exchange, then!” The Zhao Tribe chief drew out a Saintly medicine and six pieces of Saintly Material, which he tied together with his Spiritual Power, and pushed towards Ling Han.

Ling Han also used his Origin Power to tie up the seven hostages, whom he then pushed towards the side of the Zhao Tribe chief.

The two sides “let go” at the same time. Ling Han immediately drew the Saintly medicine and Saintly Material into the Black Tower. With the help of another Saintly medicine, he would be able to shrink the time needed to advance into the Great Saint Tier by a considerable few times.

Once he had advanced into the Great Saint Tier, who would be a match for him in the entire Ancient Realm?

“Move!”

The Zhao Tribe chief was the first to pounce, launching an offensive at Ling Han. As his Spiritual Power was channeled, multiple black patterns appeared on his whole body. They were completely incompatible with the Ancient Realm. It could be imagined that if he ever left this place, he would definitely be targeted by the heaven and earth.

...Even the people of the Netherworld would have their Netherworld Regulations erased if they ever went to the Immortal Realm, what more when this was a completely different cultivation system.

Perhaps this was also why none of the natives had ever left even when the Mystery Realm had clearly been opened for quite a few years.

If they left this place, even Nine Rings elites could possibly be unable to sustain even a single blow, because it was possible that even their power would be erased.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu released a furious roar. It had already held back for a very long time, but now that so many elites had revealed an aura that it despised, they had finally pushed its self-retraint to its limits.

Weng, it released a green light, which became an attack that shot towards the Zhao Tribe chief.

“Green light!”

“Destroyer!”

When the elites of the Zhao Tribe saw this, they immediately gasped in shock. Recently, there had been rumors that the legendary Destroyer had appeared. They had thought nothing of it, and thought that it was only complete nonsense that had been passed down from the ancient times, but now? The myth had become reality.

“Charge!” Their killing intent immediately blazed. According to the legends, the person that could use green light would bring devastating disaster to all the tribes.

“All of you, step aside!” Ling Han said to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others so that they would not be captured by the Zhao Tribe and used to threaten him.

“En!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others all stepped back. They were all Saints, so if they were well prepared, they could break into a run and open the path at any time. Then, aside from Ling Han, who had cultivated extreme speed, there was no other existence that could be a threat to them.

Ling Han and Xiao Gu joined forces, battling the elites of the Zhao Tribe fiercely.

This time, the number of elites from the Zhao Tribe had far exceeded the Yuan Tribe’s. There were more than 20 elites with peak stage Saint King-level battle prowess, and added with the power boost, their battle prowess was even more frightening. Even such big shots like the Blue Feather Saint King would pale in shock, and could only turn and flee.

But compared with the battle with the Yuan Tribe, Ling Han had already become considerably stronger, advancing from the peak of the middle stage of Medium Saint Tier to the peak stage of Medium Saint Tier, while his battle prowess had reached peak stage Saint King, and added with the killing formations, he, too, was far stronger than any ordinary peak stage Saint King.

Xiao Gu was already exerting its full efort. It had drawn out its true form, a crystalline white bone which was exuding a green light, and had terrifying destructive power.

But even when Ling Han used all his techniques, the two of them were still at a disadvantage.

There were really too many elites from the opposing side, which had reached the extent of a qualitative change, and there were even more elites joining the battle, while the great formation was also being recovered. The circumstances were becoming more and more unfavorable for Ling Han and his group.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head, and he immediately leaped back. Using Lightning Flash, there was no one that was capable of stopping him at all. He stretched out a hand and pressed down on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others. “Don’t resist.”

These words were spoken to Long Yushan.

Xiu, xiu. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint were immediately drawn into the Black Tower, but Long Yushan was not. She was a Saint, so she instinctively would have resistance towards others’ will.

Ling Han did not bother to waste his breath. He directly moved to knock her out, then destroyed her Spatial God Tool, and released Long Xiangyue. Without waiting for the latter to speak, he did the same to her that he did to her aunt, and drew both women into the Black Tower.

...If Long Xiangyue knew, she would definitely be very depressed because no matter what Ling Han did to her, how could she possibly resist?

Ling Han charged back, and exclaimed, “Xiao Gu, don’t resist!”

He wanted to take Xiao Gu into the Black Tower as well, but he could not, because he was unable to wrap Xiao Gu in his divine sense. It was as if the other’s whole body was covered with sharp spikes. The slightest touch, and he would be covered all over with wounds.

Xiao Gu looked at him blankly. What was the meaning of ‘don’t resist’? It could not understand these words.

Ling Han frowned, and declared, “Let’s go!”

Xiao Gu could understand these words, and it immediately ran off with Ling Han.

...It might be cute, but it was not dumb at all. It could still understand the difference between strength and weakness. If they were outmatched, it was natural that they would have to run. In future, they could still come back to redeem their pride.

Ling Han grabbed Xiao Gu, and rapidly broke through the siege using Lightning Flash and fled. Even if there were more than 100 Saint-level elites surrounding them, it was useless. In front of his extreme speed, numbers had completely lost their meaning.

“Ah!” Behind them, the furious shouts of the elites of the Zhao Tribe rang out. Even in such a situation, they still managed to flee.

Ling Han smirked internally. This time, it was him fleeing, but when he had digested that Saintly medicine, and advanced into the Great Saint Tier, he would make a powerful comeback. By that time, you bastards just wait to be pummeled!
