Chapter 333: The War Elephant Fist

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Before the exam started, many wealthy individuals were acquiring tokens and underlings all around. Ling Han had also been “harassed”. While most people were all right after being rejected, they simply continued to search for the next person, since there were so many people here anyways.

However, there were always those who thought that the world should circle around them. After being rejected, they’d show a scowl, or even threaten to kill and whatnot. This youngster was one of those people; his name was Zhao Ri.

However, Ling Han disguised multiple times, so Zhao Ri naturally couldn’t recognize Ling Han. Zhao Ri sniffed hard with his nose and set his eyes on the meat Ling Han was grilling, revealing a hungry look.

“Brother Zhao, this seems to be extremely high quality beast meat!” an underling said to Zhao Ri.

“Go get it for me,” Zhao RI said. High level beast meat was greatly tonic, and for martial artists, it wasn’t inferior to medicinal pills.

One underling immediately came over and yelled at Ling Han, “Damn brat, hand over the token, and you can get lost!”

Ling Han frowned and said, “If you don’t want to die, get lost!”

“Haha, can’t you see we have so many people?” The underling laughed grimly. Their collective strength was certainly not weak. They not only could overwhelm foes with numbers, but also had several late stage Gushing Spring Tier experts. Running rampant on their path gave them a burst of confidence.

“Hurry, this young master is hungry!” Zhao Ri urged from behind.

“Hmph, you’re going to regret refusing me.” The underling immediately threw a kick at Ling Han with vicious force; this was not just kicking Ling Han aside—it would kick his brains out.

This exam didn’t forbid them from killing, which seemed to have released many people’s viciousness.

Ling Han’s gaze turned cold. Slashing by with a finger, a chilling Sword Qi came out of thin air, and pu , fresh blood spattered—that person’s leg was severed, flying in an arc and landing on the ground in front of Zhao Ri with a splat.

“Ah!” At this moment the underling realized what had happened. After being startled, he screamed tragically as tears and snot muddled his face. Forgetting to bind up the wound, the bleeding alone might kill.

“Impudence!”

“How dare you!”

“Courting death!”

A hundred people shouted angrily all together. Was there still order if a person on his own dared to act violently in front of them?

“Seems like you have some skill.” Zhao Ri laughed coldly. “Brother Zhang, Brother Li, and Brother Ma, which one of you is willing to take down this brat?” he said to three youngsters with unordinary bearings.

These three people were all in the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, and the haughtiness on their faces was soaring through the sky.

In reality, descendants of large families aside, reaching the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier’s under thirty in the north region was certainly very impressive, and could be called the finest. After all, there were only so many prodigies that crossed into the Spiritual Ocean Tier because of a fortuitous encounter, either eating a heavenly spirit fruit or taking a spirit pill passed down from ancient times.

The youngster surnamed Zhang took large strides over with a smile and said, “Leave a nobody like this to me, it’ll save Brother Li and Brother Ma from dirtying your hands.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The other two laughed reservedly. The three’s strength was more or less the same, so they were all unconvinced about each other. Each one wanted to earn the first place, so they would take turns to display their abilities when encountering situations like this.

“Brat, no need to tell me your name, and no need to tell me who’s your backer. I don’t care. Meeting me here is your greatest misfortune, so just blame your bad fate!” the youngster surnamed Zhang said arrogantly, throwing a punch towards Ling Han.

In order to display his abilities in front of Li and Ma, this punch was unleashed with all his might to kill Ling Han in a clean sweep... whoever could take care of their opponent the fastest would obviously be stronger.

Ling Han shook his head. Did these youngsters truly think they were the kings of the world, doing whatever they wanted? He snorted and threw a punch as well. War Elephant Fist activated, weng , vein-like lines unfolded, and from inside came a light-silver dragon elephant that emitted a great presence, trampling towards the youngster surnamed Zhang.

Pu! Pu!

Everyone spurted out at the same time—martial intent, that was martial intent! Martial intent manifested meant... the Spiritual Ocean Tier!

Sh!t!

Everyone’s eyes suddenly popped out. Who would’ve thought an unprepossessing, eighteen- to nineteen-year-old youngster was actually a Spiritual Ocean Tier expert? Now they were done for, having kicked an iron plate.

Peng!

The dragon elephant ran over and the youngster surnamed Zhang was no more, trampled into a pile of mud.

Ling Han was amazed as it was his first time using the War Elephant Fist—he hadn’t known of its power. The result was... it crushed an opponent in the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier into crumbs. Moreover, he only cultivated this fist technique for a day, and didn’t truly grasp its essence.

A true War Elephant Fist fired out should be golden, and not light-silver.

However, cultivating it for a day’s time to this degree was not bad, either.

Ling Han laughed. He wasn’t overly critical of himself; he was a genius, but not a nature-defying genius—it was just that his luck was relatively better.

“S-s-sir!” Zhao Ri said whilst trembling. The Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors absolutely crushed the Gushing Spring Tier ones—even if they had had a hundred people here, it would not at all have been enough, not to mention there were only a dozen of them in the Gushing Spring Tier.

“Still want to eat meat?” Ling Han laughed gently, but seeing him crush the youngster surnamed Zhang into meat paste with a single punch, who would still feel Ling Han gentle and amiable?

The masses shook their heads all together, moving very orderly.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Hand over your tokens, everyone can get lost except for Zhao Ri.”

Everyone was as if they’d been granted amnesty, they hurriedly took out their tokens, placed them on the ground, and turned on their heels. If they lost the token, they could still rob more, but if their lives were gone, where would they find that?

Zhao Ri clenched his teeth, suddenly breaking into a run; he didn’t want to wait helplessly for death.

As he turned around and stepped down with his right leg, he stepped on nothing as his entire person instantly fell towards the ground. It wasn’t that a hole suddenly appeared on the ground or whatnot, but because his right leg had already been severed by Sword Qi, so he naturally stepped on nothing.

“Ah...” He instantly shouted tragically, struggling to prop his body up. As he sought help from his underlings, none looked twice, simply walking away rapidly with their heads down and making him instantly feel an intense chill.

“Don’t kill me, I’m a clansman of the Zhao Family. My father is Zhao Ri Cheng, a formidable Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivator, and if he knew you killed me, he would definitely find you and kill you!” Zhao Ri could only turn his head to threaten Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Alright, I’ve remembered.” He waved his hand and pu , Zhao Ri’s head was cut off and spun a few circles on the ground, his eyes still filled with regret.

“My sword intent is too strong now. Clearly, when I throw a punch or a palm, it turns into Sword Qi. This way even if I use War Elephant Fist, people would still guess that I actually use a sword. Hmm, I need to adjust a bit,” he muttered to himself. As for trash like Zhao Ri, he wouldn’t care even if he killed ten thousand like him. He didn’t know how many arrogant second-generations like this he killed in his previous life.
