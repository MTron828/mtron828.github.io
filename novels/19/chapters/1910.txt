Chapter 1911: Climbing the mountain

Without reaching the summit, they didn’t even have the right to know!

Ling Han was also interested. What exactly did this Yan Xianlu want to do?

To set foot in the place where the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King had achieved Dao was a once-in-an-epoch opportunity, yet he took it out to be shared with others without hesitation. Just how generous was he?

Furthermore, even the right to participate could only be obtained once they reached the summit. Just what major event was that?

Could it be that it had something to do with the storm of darkness?

Ling Han was expressionless, yet said to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, “Feng’er, you go into the Spatial God Tool first.”

“En!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded gently. To say nothing of the fact that she was not king tier-level, she hadn’t even advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, so she naturally did not have the right to climb the mountain. She didn’t even have the right to make an attempt.

Ling Han drew the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into the Black Tower. As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, he naturally couldn’t be bothered to care.

“Sigh, some people, really!” Bewitching Maiden Rou sighed deliberately.

Ling Han only acted as if he had not heard. It was fine as long as he ignored this bewitching woman. Otherwise, she would only become more and more stirred up.

“The time for the three stars to align is here!” Yan Xianlu suddenly declared, pointing a finger at the skies. Three bright stars appeared, and were orbiting on a specific course. “We can now climb the mountain. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is already channeled. Whoever can reach the summit first, and sits on the great rock which my master had sat on to comprehend Dao in the past will be able to gain the greatest fortune.

“Therefore, everyone, start moving.”

An aura that could not be named rippled out, and some mysterious change seemed to have taken place on the mountain peak, yet one could not really say what this change was.

Yan Xianlu was the first to set out. He took a step, already beginning to ascend the mountain.

Lao Song and Shan Jitong also moved at almost the same time. They were only a single step behind. The three of them advanced together, heading towards the summit. Yan Xianlu’s three followers, meanwhile, remained where they stood, and did not follow.

They looked towards Ling Han, all showing an icy expression.

Zhao Qingfeng had been killed by Ling Han. They naturally saw Ling Han as an enemy. If it were not for the fact that Yan Xianlu forbade them, they would definitely have made a move by now.

Ling Han naturally would not take them to heart. They were only equal in strength to Zhao Qingfeng. Even if he stepped on them, he would not feel anything.

If they were defiant, he merely had to stomp them flat.

Ling Han took the Empress’s hand. The latter was restless. No matter what, she wanted to find out just how wide the gap was between herself and top-notch prodigies.

Unafraid, others also showed fighting spirit. Who did not want to become the most supreme of king tiers, and look down on the rest of the world?

This was a great opportunity!

The place where a Celestial King achieved Dao, the cycle of a whole epoch, this kind of fortune would be astonishingly great.

Ling Han looked at the Empress, and said, “Perhaps this is the chance for us to reach the fifth severance.”

“En!” The Empress nodded. Previously, though they had not exchanged blows with fifth severance elites, they had felt the auras of this level. They could claim to have gained a solid understanding. If they gained a great fortune, and refined the Heavenly Dao Jade, then perhaps they would be able to advance to the fifth severance already today!

When the three stars aligned, as expected, the strange aura on this mountain peak dispersed considerably. No longer was it difficult just to set foot on the mountain.

However, this was still extremely difficult.

Though Yan Xianlu and his group looked very carefree, that was because they were fifth severance elites. While they were in the Severing Mundane Tier, their strength was completely on the level of the Dividing Soul Tier. To say nothing of others, merely when Ling Han stepped forward, he could feel a frightening pressure assault him, making him as if his spine was about to bend.

The Empress was still fine, only showing an expression of slight strain, but Bewitching Maiden Rou exclaimed in shock, and almost collapsed on the ground.

“Beauty, let me help you up!” Two big hands stretched out. The man said he was going to help her up, but judging by the angle at which he was extending his hands, he clearly planned to pass right under Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms, and directly grab her breasts, which was extremely perverted.

And it just so happened that Bewitching Maiden Rou had collapsed from feeling this aura, and had no way to dodge at all. She could only show an expression of humiliation and fury.

That man was a slender, tall youth in purple. A sliver of an evil grin curled up the corners of his lips. He naturally was doing it on purpose, and his motive was to take advantage of her. Of course, he, too, had absolute confidence. With his identity, strength, and status, he only had to crook a finger, and this delicate beauty would definitely throw herself into his arms.

Pa, his hands tightened, and he was just about to feel secret pleasure in his heart when a strange feeling suddenly rose up with him. ‘Yi, this feel is not right!

‘Firstly, it’s too hard, and secondly, the shape’s not right, either... f***!’

His eyes widened, and he saw that what his hands were holding were not the plump breasts of a beauty, but rather two feet. There was even dirt staining the soles of the shoes, and they were quite dirty.

“I am not an easy person. Why are you holding my feet?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

The young man in purple hurriedly released his grip and stepped back, looking like he could not retreat fast enough, and bearing an expression of loathing. He glared angrily at Ling Han. Previously, it had precisely been this guy that had interfered, grabbing Bewitching Maiden Rou and tossing her to the sidelines, and placed himself in her position.

Of course, it had been feet. Even the mere thought of this made him feel disgusted.

Though Ling Han had no intention of taking that bewitching woman for himself, they had been travel companions, so he could not bring himself to just sit back and watch as the latter was being taken advantage of. Thus, he had resolutely made a move just now. He smiled calmly, and said, “You have groped my feet, so how do you plan on compensating me for it?”

The purple-robed young man’s lips crooked up slightly, showing a menacing expression.

What a guy, he actually dared to play around with him?

“Oh, I know now. You are the newly promoted Holy Son of Alchemy City, right?” this young man said, having recognized Ling Han.

Previously, Alchemy City had invited all the forces in the world to watch the ceremony, and the White Sun Sect that this young man belonged to also received an invitation. However, White Sun Sect was a Sixth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level sect, so how could they possibly condescend to attend?

...This invitation from Alchemy City definitely had to be sent out. This was a respect that was demanded, but whether White Sun Sect attended or not, that was up to them to decide. They were too high and noble, so if they were in the mood, they could give some face, but if they were not happy, they could choose not to come.

However, Ling Han’s appearance and image had spread to practically all the forces in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm. This was an advertisement. This is the Holy Son of our Alchemy City. If you encounter him in future, remember to give some face.

Ling Han thought for a moment before coming to a realization. He said, “There is no use trying to worm your way into being my friend. Pay up for my compensation!”

The purple-robed young man couldn’t help but feel his mouth twitch. He had touched Ling Han’s stinky feet in a moment of carelessness, and now was feeling exceedingly disgusted. As the guilty party, you were actually making your complaints first? He menacingly said, “The Holy Son of Alchemy City may be considered something in the eyes of others, but in my, Shang Da’s, eyes, you are but a stinky worm!

“If you continue to do attention-seeking actions with your ugliness, take care that I will be cruel and merciless!”

He really had not exaggerated. Alchemy City could only just barely be considered a five-star force, and only those like the Thundercloud Palace and Zihe Clan were willing to give them face. Once it had risen to a Second Heaven or Third Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force, what was a mere Alchemy City worth?

So what if alchemists had outstanding status? They could all be captured, and forced to concoct alchemical pills. Just see how many alchemists would actually have the backbone to refuse.

“You are really too unconscientious. It’s not enough that you grope another’s feet as a man, you even spout threats of wanting to kill others to keep the secret from leaking to hide your own ugly actions. You truly are exceptionally shameless,” Ling Han said carelessly.

Shang Da couldn’t help but fly into a thunderous fury, stretching out his hand to grab at Ling Han. “You are seeking death!”
