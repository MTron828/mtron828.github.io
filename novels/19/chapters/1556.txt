Chapter 1557 Compensation

Ling Han sat in his courtyard. He was thinking over some matters.

Entering into the Netherworld was something he had been forced to do. He had no wish to be constantly hunted down by one, or even a whole group, of Saints. Now that he had entered the Netherworld, he should make some plans and decide on his next course of action.

The eternally unchanging plan was naturally increasing his own abilities.

Reaching this height in cultivation level, even if he was the Alchemy Emperor, and could ingest high-grade alchemical pills like they were candy, his advance through the cultivation levels would still be extremely slow. Going by the usual route, he would need at least 100 years before he could advance by one sub-minor level.

This clearly was much too slow. Merely advancing into the Genesis Tier would need over 1,000 years, what more blasting into the Celestial Realm, which would need him to be a Great Saint at least—a Great Saint that had merged the Regulations of the two Realms.

If he wanted to increase the speed, that would require the support of Saintly medicine, but just how rare were such Great Herbs?

‘If I could sweep through the Forbidden Lands, I am sure that every Forbidden Land would have one or two of such Great Herbs, at least. But the problem is the Forbidden Lands have a Saint King on guard, and if I had the ability to sweep through the Forbidden Lands, why would I need Saintly medicine?’

Ling Han was troubled. ‘Could I create a situation in which all the Saints would leave the Forbidden Lands? Then I would be able to take advantage of the crisis.’ Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Would a situation like that appear?

‘Putting that aside first, aside from improving my own abilities, there is the Divine Demon Sword. I have to work hard on boosting it up to Level 18, 19, and 20, and if there is enough top-grade Saintly Material, it can even become a Celestial Tool!’

Ling Han’s eyes flashed. If the Divine Demon Sword could take that step, he would really be invincible in both the Netherworld and Immortal Realm. Even if his opponent was a Saint King, he could kill him with a single strike.

‘This can still be considered a plan, but to obtain so much Saintly Material seems to be even harder than obtaining Saintly medicine.’

Ling Han sighed. The farther one walked on the path of cultivation, the steeper and narrower the path would be. Not only did one have to work hard on conquering dangerous peaks, he would also have to compete with those on the same path because this path could not accommodate too many people.

‘If I have the chance to, I will ask the Hysteria Demon Master to see if there is any way to madly increase the rate of accumulation of Origin Power. I have the Reincarnation Tree, so comprehension of cultivation is not an issue, and the largest problem for others is already resolved in my case.’

Peng, peng, peng. Just when Ling Han was deep in thought, a knock sounded on the main doors.

Ling Han was distracted, and used his Origin Power to open the doors. He saw an extremely beautiful woman was presently standing prettily at the doorway, her eyes casting coy glances at him, her lips curled seductively and filled with an alluring grace.

“Brother Han!” This woman rushed in immediately, and looked like she was about to pounce into Ling Han’s arms. But when her eyes swept over the surroundings and discovered that Ling Han was alone, she suddenly stopped. In a hurry, she loudly called out, “Brother Han! Brother Han!” She called twice in quick succession as if she was deliberately calling out his name for others to hear her.

Ling Han was at a loss at first, and then he smiled. “Wu Jue sent you?”

The woman was surprised, and then quickly shook her head. With an alluring smile, she said, “Brother Han, what are you saying? I have especially come to develop a relationship with you because I like you!” She dealt with Ling Han’s question, and then loudly called out, “Brother Han! Brother Han!

Ling Han shook his head. This Wu Jue was really a kid. He thought that just because he used feminine wiles to put on a show, he would be able to drive a wedge between himself and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. This was really the naive idea of a child.

He did not stop her, either; he wanted to see what kind of tricks Wu Jue was up to.

In just a short while, another knock sounded on the doors. Ling Han again opened the doors with his Origin Power, and another delicate, charming woman entered.

“Brother Han...” she also called out gently. Her eyes swept over the first woman, and seeing the strange expression on her face, she couldn’t help but look around the surroundings. When she did not find her other target, she couldn’t help but be surprised. There was only the male lead here, so how was she supposed to make the show go on?

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “You also admire me, and have thus come to offer yourself for a place in my bed?”

The second woman blushed, a hint of embarrassment and fury in her eyes, but she did not fly into a rage. She only nodded very, very slightly.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then what are you standing around for, undress quickly! Time is priceless, so don’t waste it.”

Both women were greatly shocked. ‘Are you a damn pervert? You actually intend to put on a show right in the middle of the courtyard? And you even want to have two partners at the same time?

‘Shameless! Hoodlum!’

“Seeing you are both so shy, looks like I have to make the first move!” Ling Han moved, and the two women immediately shouted shrilly. They wanted to flee, but how could they possibly escape from Ling Han’s grasp. He merely pressed down once, and the movements of both women were sealed.

As they watched Ling Han coming closer and closer, his stare perverted, both women paled in fear.

One of them could not bear it any longer, and said, “We don’t know you at all; it was Little Master who had us come here!”

Ling Han chuckled, looked at one corner, and then called out, “Come and take them back!”

Wu Jue was presently hiding at the top of a tall tower far away. When he saw Ling Han’s gaze being directed at him, he hurriedly lowered his head, as if as long they didn’t make eye contact, it did not count as him having been found out.

Mo Li shook her head. When would this little master finally grow up? Not just physical growth, but also spiritual and mental maturity.

She leaped out, and descended into Ling Han’s courtyard.

“Sorry that you had to see that,” she stated calmly.

Ling Han smilingly said, “It’s just a little kid.”

Though Wu Jue had hidden very far away, his ears were pricked high, and he was presently listening to them. When he heard that, he couldn’t help but fume. He was not a little kid.

Mo Li waved off the two women, and said, “Leave!”

“Thank you, Mo, Mo, Mo...” They did not know whether Mo Li was male or female, either. Usually, they would not have the chance to greet her.

Mo Li did not give them another look, but instead directed her gaze on Ling Han, and said, “Little Master is still young, so he is unavoidably rash in his actions. To compensate you, I have a suggestion. Another month later, the Ocean Dragon Mountains will be opening, and we can give you a place of entry.”

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “And what is the Ocean Dragon Mountains?”

“An ancient site, and it has great benefits for those beneath Genesis Tier,” Mo Li stated calmly. “This ancient site is not located in the Aurora Galaxy, and is under the combined authority of over a dozen Demon Masters. Furthermore, the entry quota is extremely limited. Even for our Chaotic Demon Palace, only 10 people are allowed to enter.”

From these words, it was evident how much of a say Mo Li had in the Chaotic Demon Palace. Merely 10 people were allowed to enter, and she could leave one place out of the 10 for Ling Han without consulting others.

“All right. I’m free, in any case, so I’ll just go take a look. Oh, right...” Ling Han paused. “Isn’t Lord Hysteria capable of creating Spatial God Tools? Don’t tell me that people can’t be kept in a Spatial God Tool and then brought into the ancient site?”

Mo Li looked at him as if she was looking at an idiot. “If a Spatial God Tool forcibly travels to some small worlds, it will cause the God Tool to collapse.”

‘So that’s how it is.’

Ling Han nodded internally. The Black Tower was definitely a Celestial Tool, and it was possible that it was best quality among Celestial Tools too. Thus, this kind of restriction had no effect on it. Otherwise, the Black Tower would have long since crumbled a few dozen to over 100 times with the number of Mystery Realms he had entered before.

“We’ll set out three days later.” Mo Li left these words behind and left.
