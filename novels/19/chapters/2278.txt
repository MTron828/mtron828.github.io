Chapter 2279: Proposal

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

It really was silent because not only had Di Fei died, no longer able to make the slightest sound, even the others were all dumbfounded, and could not say a single word.

Amonarch tier, Di Pang’s younger brother at that, had actually died just like that!

This was the monarch tier that they strained, struggled, and were so determined to become? So what if they did? If it was still the fate of being insta-killed with a single strike that awaited them, then what meaning would there be to diligently and tirelessly aspire for it?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Please continue. I’ll take my leave.”

He had already used all the evolutions of Regulations he had, and obtaining over 60 celestial fruits was his limit. Furthermore, he had always been a more “low-key” character, and had not planned to rob the others. After all, he was still in the Foreign Realm.

.-Though there was already a monarch tier that had died by his hand, who asked the former to have offended him?

“Wait!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly called out. Bearing a dazzling smile, it was as if she had completely forgotten about the matter of Di Fei. ‘Could you sell me a celestial fruit?”

“No!” Ling Han answered very decisively.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe was slightly suffocated. Not only did she have astonishing natural talent in cultivation, she was also an outstanding beauty herself. With Ling Han refusing her so decisively and resolutely, she felt irritated, and gained an urge to bite Ling Han.

Forcing out a smile, she said, “Sir, I can give you a referral to enroll into the Hundred Battles Academy. With your natural talent, you would definitely be able to stand out in a short period of time, and become a dazzling star that has newly risen.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“How about it? Though the Hundred Battles Academy was established only by a Tenth Lotus Ancestral King, it is linked in countless ways to various Ancestral Kings behind the scenes. It is not impossible to become the disciple of a Seventeenth Lotus, or even an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King in future.”

Ling Han’s first reaction was to refuse, of course. His grasp of the Regulations of the Foreign Realm was still extremely weak, and his disguise could only be effective on Severing Mundane Tiers. If a Celestial King really set eyes on him, he would definitely be exposed.

However, on second thought, Celestial King Tier forces would definitely have stronger Time Cultivation Chambers. Furthermore, a Heavenly Venerate was presently looking for him, and he could just boldly hide in an academy, and who knew, the effects of his disguise could be even better.

Of course, before this, he definitely had to successfully modify the Heaven Deceiving Technique so that it could also be effective in the Foreign Realm.

For him, this was not very difficult to do, because he had the Origin Magic Cube, which allowed him to very easily assimilate the Regulations of the two Realms. Of course, this needed time.

Moreover, he was indeed very intrigued by the cultivation system of the Foreign Realm. The deeper and more detailed his understanding of the enemy, the better, and naturally the higher the chances of defeating them.

“all right!” Ling Han nodded. He casually took out a celestial fruit, and was just about to toss it over.

“Please give me a Lightning Element celestial fruit.” Celestial Maiden Yunhe was overjoyed, and hurriedly added more details to her request.

If the elemental alignment was incorrect, it would not be of much use even if her brother consumed it.

Ling Han picked through his harvest, and threw another one over, asking, “When do we set out?”

“Thave to first retrieve a celestial fruit. Thus, please wait a few days for me, sir,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said smilingly. “There is fine wine and rare fruits in my carriage. Please go in, sit anywhere and take a rest, sir.”

“all right,” Ling Han agreed hesitantly.

Yet everyone almost exploded in fury. This was an invitation from Celestial Maiden Yunhe, allowing him to enter into her personal domain. What man would not be overwhelmed with joy? Yet Ling Han actually had such a sour face. How could this not be infuriating?

Ling Han climbed aboard the carriage. As expected, the inside was very spacious. There were chairs and a soft couch, while various rare and strange fruits were laid out on the tea table.

‘Without reservations, he lay down on the soft couch as he plucked a grape, which he tossed into his mouth. Not bad, the fruit was extremely sweet, juicy, and thirst-quenching. There was also a sliver of Regulations that circulated inside his body, which was extremely beneficial for cultivation.

This wait took another three days and nights, and only then did he see Celestial Maiden Yunhe board the carriage.

At first, she was smiling gently, but when she saw how Ling Han was presently lying on her personal couch, her pretty face immediately darkened. This damn man was really utterly shameless to actually dare to dirty her couch. Who had given him that courage?

“Scram!” She couldn’t help but exclaim angrily; she was a bit of a clean freak.

Ling Han did not move, and retorted, “Didn’t you say I could sit anywhere?”

‘Then you should have some minimal self-awareness, at least. Could you just simply sit or lie on the personal couch of a lady?

“Don’t you think this is rather ungentlemanly?* Celestial Maiden Yunhe asked, trying her best to calm down, and speaking reason with Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “With such a genial invitation from the celestial maiden, if I acted reserved with you, wouldn’t that be a rebuff to you?”

As he spoke, he grabbed an apple, and bit crisply into it.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe gritted her teeth in fury. This guy was really a ruffian, and was extremely thick-skinned as well. This kind of person was the hardest to deal with.

She ignored Ling Han, and sat on the chair at the side, calling out loudly, “Set out!”

Long Tu, who was outside, shivered, and hurriedly obeyed. With him raising the whip to urge the horse, the steed immediately galloped onwards.

Ling Han spoke no further. He had not spent the last three days idly. Instead, he was refining the Heaven Deceiving Technique, but he still needed a little more time to succeed. He did not speak any more nonsense with Celestial Maiden Yunhe, but rather focused completely on studying the Heaven Deceiving

Technique.

The carriage was slightly swaying, but it caused no effect at all. Ling Han just simply sat quietly by himself, just like an old monk.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe looked at him, feeling more and more discomfort in her heart.

She naturally had no shortage of courters—in fact, there were so many that she was no longer concerned—but when she saw how a man ignored her completely, an intense fury rose up in her heart.

This man. Why didn’t he just die?

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed, and the carriage finally stopped swaying, arriving at an old town. This was not the location of Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s clan, but rather a neutral zone, where there was neither any Regulation of Darkness nor any Regulations of Light, so no harm would be

caused to Ling Han.

She had Ling Han stay here for the moment, while she would continue her journey onwards to her clan. When she handed a celestial fruit to her younger brother, and she herself had broken through to the Fifth Severance, she would come back and find Ling Han, and they would head towards the Hundred

Battles Academy together.

Ling Han had no disagreement. He found a place, and settled down there while continuing to use the local Time Cultivation Chamber to complete the Heaven Deceiving Technique as quickly as possible.

He asked Small Tower, I still have a large amount of Star Stones from the Celestial Realm with me. Can you recharge using them?

Small Tower shook its head. “No. The power I need has already surpassed the range of Ninth Heaven. However, this can be used on the Reincarnation Tree.”

The level of Heavenly Venerable Tier was too high, surpassing Regulations itself. Thus, the Star Stones could not be of any help to Small Tower, but the Reincarnation Tree was still in the category of ‘normal,” and the Star Stones could still be effective on it.

“p**, why hadn’t you said so earlier!” Ling Han almost jumped in fury. What was needed the most to modify the Heaven Deceiving Technique was time for comprehension, and it was precisely what the Reincarnation Tree could help him with. Furthermore, the women also needed the Reincarnation Tree for

cultivation.

“You haven’t asked, either,” Small Tower said, but followed up with an explanation. “My power is limited. It is best for me to constantly stay dormant.”

As expected of a proud Demon Tower that liked to speak tough. It was clearly something that could have been resolved if it had taken the initiative to just explain, yet it still wanted to irritate Ling Han.

Ling Han, on the other hand, very much wanted to see the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. Just what kind of person was he that he could actually create such a precious Tool like Small Tower? And there was also the la. It must have had some very profound relations with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

Based on these two aspects, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable probably was not a serious person, either.
