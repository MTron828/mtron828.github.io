Chapter 2002: Purple grade Yang Soul Stone

Ling Han and his group all became excited.

They hurriedly split up, and began digging around at the ground.

“I found one!”

“I found one too!”

Their voices rang out in succession as they found carcasses of marine creatures.

The majority of them were Heaven Soul corpses, and had nurtured indigo grade Yang Soul Stones, while a smaller portion was blue grade. In the eyes of others, these would be ultimate treasures, but were now thrown disdainfully into their Spatial God Tools by Ling Han and his group.

...200 was needed to be able to produce an indigo grade Yang Soul Stone, so what was it if not useless?

However, now that they had arrived here, they had not developed the habit of throwing them away. They simply stowed them away first.

Going by the rate at which they were harvesting, they would only need one or two months’ time for all of them to gain 200 indigo grade Yang Soul Stones, which they could then fuse into a purple grade one, and advance to the Dividing Soul Tier with the highest grade of Yang Soul Stone.

This should be the graveyard of the marine creatures. Those weaker existences had already decayed fully when they had been carried here by the ocean waters. Thus, those that could come here were at least Earth Soul in level, and could contribute blue grade Yang Soul Stones.

But even if others found out, so what? Would they be able to come here?

No one’s Origin Power and power of Regulation could possibly hold on for so long. Before they could swim to a closer depth, they would have been crushed to bits by the water pressure.

Only Ling Han could do what others could not.

“Here’s a big guy!” Ling Han dug at a spot, and after a portion of the corpse of a marine creature was exposed, he couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised.

This was a swordfish that was completely golden. Even if it had been dead for countless years, there was not the slightest sign of decay. Furthermore, there were multiple seals of great dao on its body, exuding a majestic aura, as if it could show its might at any moment, suppressing eternity.

“The Immortal Palace Tier!” The four women rushed over, and all exclaimed in shock.

Since Heaven soul marine creatures could nurture indigo grade Yang Soul Stones, then what about an Immortal Palace Tier?

Purple grade!

“You guys go on and look around further. There shouldn’t be just a single Immortal Palace Tier corpse here,” Ling Han said. This underwater cemetery should not house just marine creatures that had died 100 million years ago, but would also have those that had died 200 million years ago, 300 million years ago... The accumulation over countless billions of years made this place become covered with treasure.

“En.” The four women all went their separate ways.

Ling Han naturally was not of the mind to be bothered about the carcasses of other marine creatures. As long as he could dig out the Yang Soul Stone inside this swordfish, that would be a natural purple grade Yang Soul Stone, which was genuinely the highest grade.

Pu, he delivered a stab with his sword, but the swordfish’s eyeball was filled with flexibility. After slightly sinking in, seven seals shone, instantly bouncing him backwards.

The eyeball.... was not damaged.

So tough.

Ling Han was surprised. It should be known that even if it was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, so what? Without being on guard, it was still completely susceptible to being killed by a Severing Mundane Tier... unless it was someone like Ling Han, who had a naturally strong physique, and was always at the best state of defense.

But this swordfish had already been dead for countless years, yet its defense was still so strong?

It had to have been born with a naturally strong physique.

“F***, isn’t this just causing trouble for me?” Ling Han sighed, and tried to stow the swordfish into the Black Tower.

He carefully extended his divine sense, wrapping it around the swordfish.

Seals flickered vaguely on the swordfish’s body, as if they had discovered Ling Han’s actions. However, there was no powerful backlash, so Ling Han did not stop, and continued to wrap his divine sense around it.

This was indeed a big guy, but compared to the other giants of the ocean, its size was still relatively slender.

After an hour, Ling Han showed a hint of elation.

Success, he had completely wrapped his divine sense around this swordfish.

‘Come on then!’

Xiu, this giant swordfish had disappeared without a trace. Naturally, it had entered into the Black Tower.

With a flash, Ling Han followed it into the Black Tower.

Though the present power of the Black Tower was also limited by his cultivation level, it was definitely considerably stronger than him. Furthermore, the power of the Black Tower was endless, and there was no need to worry about using it up.

“Small Tower, come, give me a hand!” Ling Han once again began to dissect the giant swordfish.

Small Tower slowly appeared, and said, “Yo, what ******* luck, you actually found the carcass of an Immortal Palace Tier marine creature.”

Ling Han was speechless. This proud Tower would not feel comfortable if it went one day without insulting him.

“Come and give me a hand!”

Small Tower might be proud, but all its actions were for Ling Han’s own good. Thus, though it would keep saying mocking words, it still began to draw on the power of the Black Tower, helping Ling Han to dissect this giant fish.

Even so, it had still taken them three days to fully dissect the fish’s head.

“As expected, purple grade Yang Soul Stone!” Ling Han laughed loudly. This time, he was finally satisfied.

He exited the Black Tower, and saw that the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were still searching. Meanwhile, Hu Niu was seated on a gigantic crab. As she swung her long legs back and forth, she was chewing on a chicken leg, incredibly carefree and at ease.

This was not the little girl slacking off, but rather that she had found the carcass of an Immortal Palace Tier marine creature.

“You are really lucky.” Ling Han couldn’t help but smile.

“Of course, Niu is too awesome!” Hu Niu did not have the slightest idea of modesty.

Ling Han released his divine sense, and just like how had done before, he stowed the colossal crab into the Black Tower as well. Then, its dissection was only successfully completed after seven days. It could not be helped. The defense of the giant crab was stronger, and the Black Tower could not show its full might, either, so they could only progress bit by bit.

When they exited the Black Tower, the Empress had also gained something. Naturally, it was also the carcass of an Immortal Palace Tier marine creature.

This almost killed Bewitching Maiden Rou with anxiety. Ling Han and the others had all obtained a perfect Yang Soul Stone, and only she was left still searching.

She hurriedly spoke sweet words to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden so the latter would help her look. In any case, the other woman had not even broken through to the Severing Mundane Tier, so even if she had a Yang Soul Stone, it was no use—this stuff could not be brought out, and could only be used here.

When Ling Han prized out a Yang Soul Stone for the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou finally managed to find a great gain.

It could only be said that this place was practically a treasury of Yang Soul Stones.

This time, all four Severing Mundane Tiers had obtained a purple grade Yang Soul Stone.

“Let’s break through to the Dividing Soul Tier.”

The four of them separated a bit, while a Yang Soul Stone that was not much smaller than a house was placed in front of each of them. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After entering into the Yang Soul Ocean, the majority of their time was actually spent on searching for Yang Soul Stones, and breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier would only take about a month’s time—the prerequisite was that you had already touched the threshold before entering into the Dividing Soul Tier. You could only begin to split out your soul in this place.

Ling Han and the others were already peak-stage Severing Mundane Tiers a few hundred years ago, and had touched the threshold of the Dividing Soul Tier. What they lacked was only a Yang Soul Stone to complete that final step.

They each vibrated their spirits to split out a portion and insert it into the Yang Soul Stone, becoming their own divided soul, which was equivalent to having an additional manifestation of themselves.

“Don’t use your own spirit,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

“Hmm?”

“Split out one of the three Source Powers inside your body.” Small Tower did not explain anything, and continued to guide Ling Han on what he should do.

“Why?” Yet Ling Han was the type to get to the bottom of any matter.

Small Tower sighed. “Source Powers themselves have consciousness. After you split them out, the independent nature and growth of the divided soul would be improved. Moreover, if you split out your own spirit, that would be a kind of damage to the original.

“Though after attaining Immortal Palace Tier, all the divided souls would return, damaged... ultimately still means that it has been damaged, and there would be flaws.

“Using a Source Power as replacement is the truly perfect way to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier.”
