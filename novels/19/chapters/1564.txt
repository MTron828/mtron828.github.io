Chapter 1565 Swallowing an Insul

Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Everyone was stunned by this sight.In fact, this outcome had already been a foregone conclusion once the Divine Demon Sword had unleashed its full might. However, just how rare were Eternal River Tier elites who had formed over 2,000,000 heavenly bodies? Truth be told, they were even harder to find than Demon Masters! Yet, Tan Mo had been killed not long after his appearance. The onlookers were truly finding it hard to digest this outcome.

“No!!!” the four members of the Tan Clan exclaimed in astonishment. Tan Mo had been the most outstanding prodigy among the younger generation of the Tan Clan, and the clan had held extremely high hopes for him. Yet, he had actually been killed by a mere ant in this Mystery Realm!

“You’ve brought a huge disaster upon yourself!” a member of the Tan Clan roared as he pointed at Ling Han. “Commit suicide to repent for your crime!”

Ling Han scratched his head. Although the Divine Demon Sword had drained him of all his stamina, unlike Origin Power, it would recover extremely quickly. At the very least, he could stand up straight without collapsing to the ground.

In any case, was there something wrong with these people’s brains?

If he had been afraid of the Tan Clan, would he have killed Tan Mo in the first place?

“If you people continue to spew nonsense, I’ll make sure to kill you too!” There was killing intent in his eyes as he glared at the members of the Tan Clan. He wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, so he wouldn’t kill these four people merely because they had provoked him. However, if they continued to push his limits, they would eventually breach his bottom line.

The members of the Tan Clan immediately shut up upon hearing this. They were far weaker than Tan Mo, so how could they dare to oppose Ling Han?

“Activate the decree to kill that villainous brat!” they whispered among themselves.

“But the sea is far too turbulent. Without the protection of the decree, we might not make it out of here alive.”

“...Then we won’t oppose that villainous brat for the time being. In any case, the sixth elder definitely won’t forgive him when he learns of this. Moreover, Brother Mo also said so just then. The sixth elder has notified the clan, so they’ll definitely send more powerful elders over. At that time... Humph!”

They chose to swallow this insult and back down for the time being.

Zhu Ba and the others were all invigorated with excitement upon seeing this. Tan Mo had suppressed all of them just then, so they had only been able to watch on helplessly as these people acted with haughtiness and arrogance. However, now that Tan Mo had been killed, these four people instantly backed down in cowardice. What a sweet feeling this was!

Anyhow, they were also unable to understand how Ling Han had managed to fully activate the Demonic Tool. However, they didn’t mull over this for too long. After all, Ling Han was on their side now. This brought pride to their side, and it was truly a delightful feeling.

There was killing intent in Mo Li’s eyes as she swept his gaze over the four members of the Tan Clan. However, she eventually held himself back from attacking.

One needed to remove the roots when cutting weed, but these four people still possessed the protection of a decree. Just then, Tan Mo hadn’t had the chance to flee back into the range of the decree. However, these four people certainly wouldn’t leave its range now.

With the decree of a Demon Master protecting them, how could Mo Li hope to kill them?

However, once a decree was activated, it would only be effective for a limited amount of time. Yet, they all had to stay in this place for three years. Mo Li and the others refused to believe that this decree could be effective for this long.

Thus, this was merely a matter of killing them sooner or later. As long as these four people were disposed of, they could easily make up an excuse and say that they, along with Tan Mo, had been killed by the sea. After all, wasn’t this a common and understandable occurrence?

They had charged in without any understanding of the situation, so whom could they blame for their deaths?

In fact, Ling Han had also considered killing them to destroy the evidence. However, he wasn’t resolute enough to kill people for no good reason. More importantly, would someone with the temper of Tan Feng believe his explanation?

He would definitely become wild with rage upon learning of the deaths, and it was very likely that he would indiscriminately capture people to search their souls. Thus, Ling Han still wouldn’t be able to hide the truth.

That being the case, he might as well be frank and forthright.

He would fearlessly admit to being the killer!

If he managed to obtain the Chaos Source Rock, he would receive one power boost opportunity after the Small Tower refined it. At that time, he would possess the ability to kill anyone under the level of Celestial King. That being the case, what trouble could a mere Yellow Demon bring? Of course, he wouldn’t waste this opportunity if he didn’t need to. After all, he wanted to save this power boost opportunity for the Eight Stones Forbidden Land.

“Small Tower, can you give me a few more power boost opportunities?” Ling Han asked. “You can just give me slightly less power each time. For example, I’m happy with power at the Severing Mundane Tier.” Regardless of whether he was in the Immortal Realm or Netherworld, power at the Severing Mundane Tier was already enough to crush all Genesis Tier Saints.

“No problem, I can give you three opportunities with power at the consummate level of the Genesis Tier,” Small Tower quickly replied. “However, the condition is that you’re able to obtain the Chaos Source Rock for me.”

“Three times? And only at the consummate level of the Genesis Tier?” Ling Han asked. He started to haggle with the Small Tower, saying, “This isn’t right! Are you telling me that the power of a Celestial King is only equivalent to that of three Genesis Tier Saints?”

“The power boosts aren’t calculated like that; take it or leave it,” Small Tower said proudly.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Fine, I’ll take the three opportunities.”

Before entering the Celestial Realm, having the opportunity to wield power at the Genesis Tier three times was most likely more advantageous than having the opportunity to wield power at the Celestial King Tier once. If the need arose, he could simply find more Chaos Source Rocks to feed the vampire-like Small Tower. This would give him more power boost opportunities.

‘Sigh, things were much better in the past. I would receive a “free” power boost opportunity every time I advanced to the next cultivation level.’

They continued to advance. Moreover, even though Ling Han had obtained a Saint Fruit, no one suggested that he share it.

Of course they didn’t. Not only did Ling Han possess Demonic Tools, but he even possessed the ability to fully activate them. As such, who would dare to provoke him?

Ling Han swallowed some alchemical pills as he sat on the flying shuttle. He then retrieved a large number of True Origin Stones and used them to form a large Spiritual Qi Formation. This would allow him to rapidly replenish his depleted Origin Power.

Everyone on the shuttle gazed at him with respect and fear. Just his ability to activate a Demonic Tool alone was enough reason for them to kneel in reverence.

Chi Huangji shook his head slightly. He had initially thought that he was only slightly weaker than Ling Han. By the looks of things now, the gulf between them had already grown to a boundlessly large extent. This gulf was so large that he could only gaze up at Ling Han. Although he was unwilling to, he still accepted this reality.

If he refused to even recognize this difference, then what right would he have to be called a prodigy?

The small shuttle continued forward. After several hours, they met with another gigantic wave.

However, they faced a huge test time as Ling Han was still recovering from his previous battle. Only Mo Li could deal with this wave. When they eventually passed the wave, the small shuttle beneath them had already been smashed into pieces.

“It looks like we need to come up with a backup plan,” Mo Li said as he retrieved another flying shuttle. They had naturally come to this Mystery Realm very well prepared. “Zi Yuan, Heng Jun, Da Cheng, Qing Yu, Han Long, Guang Ming, you guys take another shuttle and return first. You can search for Godly medicine in the outer regions of the Mystery Realm.”

“Understood!” The six people who were mentioned all nodded in understanding. They were weaker than the others, and even the shuttles wouldn’t be able to protect them anymore. Since they needed to rely on their physique to advance now, these people would merely be holding everyone back.

Thus, it was better that they retreated now. After all, this sea was vast, and there were Godly medicines everywhere. As such, there was no need for them to stubbornly advance.

The group of 10 was divided into two smaller groups, one which retreated and one which continued to advance. The latter group only consisted of Ling Han, Mo Li, Chi Huangji, and Wu Jue.

When the next wave came, Ling Han had already recovered most of his energy. However, even though he and Mo Li worked together, the shuttle that they rode was still instantly smashed into pieces. At the same time, the wave continued to threaten their safety.

However, Ling Han was unafraid. His physique was powerful enough to withstand this wave. Meanwhile, Mo Li was also able to withstand the wave. Chi Huangji didn’t fare as well as them, and he was left extremely disheveled. However, he was a rank three king tier, after all, so he was able to grit his teeth and withstand the wave. As for Wu Jue, he managed to scrape through the wave thanks to a necklace that he was wearing.

This was also the reason why only Mo Li and the three others continued forward—the others would be unable to withstand the power of these gigantic waves. In fact, their flesh and bones would be brutally crushed if they attempted to face these waves.

In any case, it was as if Mo Li had prepared countless shuttles, retrieving a new one each time the previous one was destroyed. This allowed them to spend less Origin Power as they advanced forward. Although it wasn’t much, saving a bit was still better than saving nothing at all.

After continuing forward for three months like this, a colossal peak that towered into the sky gradually appeared before their eyes.
