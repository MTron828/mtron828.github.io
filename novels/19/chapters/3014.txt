3015 Arrival of Lake Spirits

Lu Yang was about to explode in fury.

He was the son of a Celestial King, so the fact that he was officially getting married to Ning Haixin was already giving her enough face.

Yet, not only was someone causing trouble now, but they were even calling him an ugly bastard?

“Father-in-law, today’s a big day for Haixin and me!” he said in a faint voice as he suppressed his anger. However, everyone could hear the displeasure in his voice.

Today was his wedding, so he naturally didn’t want others to cause trouble.

Ning Daolan waved his hand in reply, gesturing for him to be patient. He would definitely deal with everything.

He looked at his daughter, and asked, “Haixin, what do you say?”

He paused for a moment before stressing, “Don’t forget, you’re my daughter!”

This was both a reminder and a threat.

Sure enough, Ning Haixin involuntarily shuddered when she heard this. In her mind, her father had always been the definition of the word “strict.” He possessed absolute authority.

She subconsciously wanted to obey her father’s will. However, her mind shuddered just as she was about to speak.

If she obeyed her father, the remaining days of her life would be passed in darkness and misery.

She had always been an obedient daughter, and she had never gone against her father for anything. However, a rebellious urge rose in her mind for the very first time.

She slowly turned to face Ning Daolan. Her knees buckled, and she kneeled in front of him.

“I’m grateful for the upbringing that you’ve given me all these years,” she said. She respectfully kowtowed three times before continuing, “However, marriage is something that will decide my happiness for the rest of my life, and I don’t want to sacrifice my future just like this.

“So, please forgive me, father. Please allow me to act wilfully just one time!”

Ning Daolan’s expression involuntarily became dark. He humphed and slammed the table, roaring, “Ungrateful wretch! If you dare to take a single step out of this room, then you’re not my daughter anymore!”

Ning Haixin’s slender figure shuddered when she heard this. However, she resolutely turned around and walked toward the door.

One step after another, her pace gradually quickened as if she were experiencing a transformation in her mind.

“Very well… Very well!” Ning Daolan said with an ice-cold expression. There was a baleful look in his eyes as he gazed at his daughter, and he suddenly lashed out to grab at her.

This was the act of an Ascending Origin Tier elite, so was it something that Dividing Soul Tier cultivators could block? Was it something that Severing Mundane Tier cultivators could resist?

However, Gui Hou was extremely stubborn, and he really stepped forward to block Ning Daolan’s action. This was naturally in vain, and he was forcefully sent flying by Ning Daolan’s terrifying power. His shell cracked apart, and he appeared as disheveled as could be.

“Hmph! Ungrateful wretch!” Ning Daolan spat coldly. His expression was extremely dark. This had happened before so many people, and it had caused him to lose all his face. This was utterly embarrassing.

The guests all smiled coldly. They were from the nearby forces, and they were all as powerful as the Azure Sky Sect. However, if the Azure Sky Sect managed to ally with the Lu Clan, they would quickly rise above the pack.

Who dared to provoke a Celestial King Tier force?

Now that the wedding had descended into such a farce, how would the Lu Clan view the Azure Sky Sect in the future? Of course, this was given that the wedding could even continue.

“Continue!” Ning Daolan ordered. A burst of power bore down, preventing Gui Hou from crawling back up.

The instruments started playing again, sending cheerful melodies into the surroundings. However, after the farcical scenes just then, things were only cheerful on the surface. In reality, everyone was waiting to witness a fun show.

Sure enough, loud rumbles quickly traveled over from outside.

One after another, numerous people with all kinds of strange features appeared at the door. There were some with whiskers, some with pincers, some with shrimp tails, and so on and so forth. It was clear that this was an army from the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

“Old Gui, what happened?!” the lake spirits exclaimed in shock and anger when they saw Gui Hou being suppressed on the floor.

These people dared to attack members of the Heavenly Treasure Lake?

“Which bastard did this?” a shrimp person roared.

The guests all wore strange expressions as they looked toward Ning Daolan. He was truly being abused to the face.

Ning Daolan’s expression grew even darker, and there was incandescent fury boiling in his mind. This had initially been a joyous opportunity to ally with a Celestial King Tier force. Now, however, all kinds of spirits and monsters were charging over to cause trouble.

What would it matter even if he suppressed all of them? They were destined to become a laughingstock! This was destined to bring humiliation to the Lu Clan! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He looked at Ning Haixin. This was all because of his wretched daughter!

If his wretched daughter hadn’t become companions with those lake spirits, would they have caused all of this trouble today?

Boom!

An aura of rage radiated from his body. He had made up his mind. He was going to go on a killing spree today.

Since things had already come to this, he would seize the opportunity to dispose of the lake spirits from the Heavenly Treasure Lake. He would then be able to conquer the Heavenly Treasure Lake.

“You’re seeking death!” Ning Daolan roared. He resolutely lashed out, launching a palm strike at the group of lake spirits.

“Old Geezer Ning, don’t you dare be so impudent!” Two figures dashed out with a roar. They stepped forward to block Ning Daolan’s attack.

Peng, peng!

There was a violent shudder as Ning Daolan’s attack was blocked. Everyone looked over, only to see two fish people whose entire bodies were covered in scales. They were both at the Ascending Origin Tier, but it was clear that they were both weaker than Ning Daolan. After blocking his attack, they both fell back in retreat, with their faces beet-red.

The wedding hall wasn’t protected by a spell formation, so it instantly collapsed from the shock waves of the clash.

The guests hurriedly leaped outside, and the smiles on their faces grew even wider. This was truly an entertaining show.

Ning Daolan’s expression was twisted with indescribable darkness at this moment, and he turned around, and commanded, “Elders, advance together and defeat those monsters!”

“Sect Leader, that white snake…” an elder said in hesitation. They naturally wanted to capture the Heavenly Treasure Lake for themselves as well. However, they had resisted this temptation the entire time because of that powerful white snake.

They had no other option. That white snake possessed the bloodline of a True Dragon, and this allowed its battle prowess to be far superior compared to those who were at the same cultivation level. If they recklessly started a conflict, it was difficult to predict what the outcome would be.

Ning Daolan waved a hand, and said, “It’s the Heavenly Treasure Lake that’s inciting the conflict this time. We have no option but to defend ourselves”

“Understood!” the elders said, nodding. Indeed! They hadn’t provoked the Heavenly Treasure Lake on purpose, and it was instead the Heavenly Treasure Lake that was threatening them first.

The Ascending Origin Tier elders all stepped forward—there were eight of them in total. Combined with Ning Daolan’s two warriors, Zuo Yi and Jiang Feng, this was a team of 11 Ascending Origin Tier elites.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Treasure Lake didn’t have anywhere near as many Ascending Origin Tier elites. After all, unlike the Azure Sky Sect, they had only started flourishing recently. Moreover, which Ascending Origin Tier elite hadn’t cultivated for hundreds of millions of years or even a few billion years?

If they engaged in this conflict, the Heavenly Treasure Lake would definitely suffer defeat. It wouldn’t be surprising even if they were all killed.

Ning Haixin was also being suppressed at this moment, but she still said, “Uncles, please don’t sacrifice yourselves for Haixin! It isn’t worth it! Haixin will accept her fate. Please return, Uncles. Please don’t start a battle.”

“Little Ning, there are no cowards in the Heavenly Treasure Lake!”

“We’ll definitely rescue you today!”

“Don’t worry, don’t worry. Our elites still have yet to arrive!”

The lake spirits from the Heavenly Treasure Lake all spoke to comfort her. They didn’t appear flustered at all.

Their confidence was naturally coming from the white snake who had already advanced to the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier long ago. Moreover, this snake possessed the bloodline of a True Dragon, so her battle prowess was formidable enough to suppress everyone at the same cultivation level.
