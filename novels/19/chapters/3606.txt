Chapter 3607: Killed directly

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lei Jiujun, a prodigy of the Lei Clan, could also be ranked in the top twenty among the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County.

This kind of prodigy had actually been defeated with a single move.

How was this possible?

Who could accept this?

Ling Han strode over. This Lei Jiujun was already impressive enough. He had taken the Heavenly Pattern Jade head-on, yet he had not died from a single strike. Furthermore, this was also because Lei Jiujun had been too careless. Otherwise, he would not have been in such a miserable state.

“Ling Han, you’re too ruthless! You even broke Handsome Brother’s hand! I don’t want a cripple!” the little girl shouted from the sidelines.

Ling Han ignored her, his eyes fixed on Lei Jiujun. His killing intent had already locked onto the latter.

Lei Jiujun wasn’t Zhang Qihua; Zhang Qihua didn’t want to take his life from the very beginning. Moreover, this person was forthright and frank, so Ling Han naturally didn’t have any killing intent. In fact, he didn’t even plan to break Zhang Qihua’s arm in the first place.

But Lei Jiujun was different. Whoever wanted to kill him, he would kill. It was only right and proper.

Sensing Ling Han’s chilling killing intent, Lei Jiujun couldn’t help but shudder. At first, he was still screaming in pain, but now, he suddenly stopped, and looked towards Ling Han.

“You’re so ruthless!” he said through gritted teeth, filled with resentment.

One arm was crippled, and it was his right arm at that, which was enough to cripple one third of his battle prowess.

Though the Lei Clan was extraordinary, it was also impossible for them to obtain Saintly medicine, which meant that he would always be a cripple in future.

Ling Han cracked a smile, “It’s all right. There is no need to worry that you will become a cripple in future, because you will soon lose your life.”

“You actually want to kill me?” Lei Jiujun’s expression was filled with shock.

Peng!

Ling Han shot out a punch, and directly blasted Lei Jiujun into smithereens.

He knew that Lei Jiujun would definitely say some threatening words, such as how he was the Young Master of some clan, or the Dao Child of some sect, or having a powerful cousin, or something along those lines.

But did he care?

After refining the Five Elements Karmic Pill, he would return to the Celestial Sea Planet. You guys can just slowly look for him.

“Y-you’re in big trouble!” someone said in a trembling voice.

“He’s the young master of the Lei Clan, and he’s also the most highly anticipated clansman of the Lei Clan. Having killed him, the Lei Clan will turn the sky upside down!”

“It should be known that the strength of the Lei Clan is not the slightest bit inferior to the Pang Clan. Now that Lei Jiujun has died because of the Pang Clan, the Pang Clan would probably go crazy as well.”

“He’s dead, he’s definitely dead.”

“Will we be implicated?”

Everyone was extremely pessimistic. They could only watch helplessly as Lei Jiujun was killed. If the Lei Clan took their anger out on them, all of them would definitely be out of luck.

Ling Han picked up the Heavenly Pattern Jade. He naturally wouldn’t be explaining anything to these people.

He continued to kill monsters, and after about nine days, the seven babies gathered once more, putting the essence of flames together. Strangely, these bright and flickering things fused together by themselves, as if they had a life of their own. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In an instant, a crimson red bead appeared in the box. There seemed to be a flame flickering inside.

Ling Han stretched out a hand to touch it. Hiss, it was so hot.

He closed the box. It was made of jade, so there was no need to worry that the box would be burnt.

All right, the trip to the Extreme Flame Valley had been successfully completed, so it was time to go to the next place.

Ling Han took out the map that Li Xingchen had given him, and soon confirmed his next destination.

Cold Water Lake.

This was the closest stop to the Extreme Flame Valley, so Ling Han naturally arranged for it to be his next stop.

However, before the nine of them had even set out, a group of people had already walked in.

“One, two, nine, five, six…” Second Baby began to count.

Ling Han’s mouth twitched slightly. Though Second Baby had the best eyesight, he could not have any expectations when it came to counting. He took a look for himself. There were a total of seventeen people in the other party’s party, and every single one of them was exuding the confidence that was unique to elites.

At the very least, they had to be elites that had advanced into Celestial Path.

“Ling Han, how dare you, you actually dare to kill the prized son of the Lei Clan!” A middle-aged man shouted at Ling Han, obviously looking down on him.

This was natural, because he was a Foundation Building elite. Against a mere Mystery Realm Tier, how could he be reserved?

Ling Han’s eyes sharpened, “Since you know of this Demon King’s great reputation, why have you come to seek death?”

“Ling Han, don’t steal my nickname!” The little loli was displeased, and immediately protested.

“I’ll borrow it for a while, and return it to you later.” Ling Han turned his head, yet smiled.

“That’s more like it.” The little loli stopped playing around and continued to lick the candy.

Those seventeen people all exploded in fury. These two people were really too arrogant, to actually dare to ignore elites like them.

“No need for nonsense, just apprehend him,” someone said impatiently. Wasn’t it a joke to waste time on a Mystery Realm Tier cultivator?

“That’s good too. Capture him, and execute him with a thousand cuts, as a tribute for Jiujun,” someone beside him nodded.

Ling Han humphed and said, “Do you guys think you can defeat me?”

“Nothing but a mere Mystery Realm Tier!”

These 17 people were the coalition troops of the Lei Clan and Pang Clan. They knew that no one could match Ling Han in a one-on-one battle. Even Lei Jiujun had been killed, so they joined forces to charge in.

…Originally, they had been waiting outside. After all, if they entered the valley, their cultivation level would be suppressed, so it was not as safe as if they were outside. However, Ling Han had not come out even after a long time, and upon further thought, he was also collecting fire essence, so no matter what, he would have to stay inside for a good number of years.

This was too long, and they could not afford to wait.

Oh, the prodigy of the Lei Clan had been killed, and they actually had to wait for a good number of years before they could get their revenge. Wasn’t this going to be a huge joke?

Thus, even if they had to sacrifice a few people, they were determined to enter the valley and capture Ling Han.

This time, the Pang Clan was also implicated. It could not be helped. They could not escape the responsibility of Lei Jiujun’s death, so it was naturally impossible for them to stay out of this matter.

However, 17 Foundation Building elites, even if their cultivation level was suppressed, should be enough to suppress a mere Mystery Realm Tier.

A baleful killing intent appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “Since you people are so determined to seek death, I’ll oblige you!”

“Charge!” Seventeen people charged over at the same time.

Ling Han stepped forwards, and directly channelled the destructive energy, throwing out a heavy punch.

Peng!

Someone had just approached, wanting to impede him and allow the others to take advantage of the opening to make a move, but under the attack of destructive energy, that person was immediately blasted into smithereens.

This was utterly terrifying.

In a single exchange, the seventeen people had become sixteen people.

F***, when the elites from the Pang Clan and Lei Clan saw this, they all looked shocked. They knew that Ling Han was very strong. Otherwise, he could not have possibly killed Lei Jiujun, and defeated Zhang Qihua.

However, being able to kill a Foundation Building Tier cultivator with a single punch still caused them to go numb with shock.

Didn’t that mean that Ling Han only had to throw another sixteen punches, and they would all be done for?

Since Ling Han had already started killing, why would he hold back?

With the use of Destruction Energy, he had the intention to kill everyone to keep the secret.

‘Die!’

Peng! Peng! Peng!

His figure turned, and destructive energy surged. Even if his opponent was prepared, and similarly greeted him with high-level energy, the stronger one would still have one of his arms destroyed, and those with weaker abilities would still be unable to escape death.

In just a few moves, the number of seventeen people had already decreased sharply to nine.

This scared everyone out of their wits, so how could they still bother to kill the enemy? They hurriedly turned around and fled..
