Chapter 3590: Ingesting the fruit

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han successfully obtained the Star Origin Fruit.

When he obtained the celestial fruit, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Previously, he had been worried that the Primordial Sect would go back on their word, and not give him the celestial fruit. After all, the fact that the Primordial Sect had hosted this martial arts tournament was only a pretense. Their real purpose was to boost Liu Jun’s popularity. Of course, capturing Ling Han and recruiting outstanding talents was also something they could do in passing, and it was killing three birds with one stone.

He forcibly interfered and snatched this Treasured Fruit. For the Primordial Sect, this was equivalent to a slap to their faces. Naturally, he would worry that the Primordial Sect would go back on their word.

Eat.

He immediately thought. Only by having it in his stomach, would it be the safest.

Ling Han ate ravenously, but he immediately frowned. The taste of this thing really could not be considered delicious. It had an indescribable sour smell, and the flesh of the fruit was also rustling, not the slightest bit smooth and tender. He forcibly suppressed the urge to spit it out, and swallowed this fruit completely into his stomach.

Had I eaten a fake celestial fruit?

Ling Han couldn’t help but think, but he had not even finished the thought, when he immediately felt a world-shaking change take place in his body. A powerful force surged out, stimulating the leap of his level of being.

Pa, pa, pa! One after another, the shackles were broken open, but Ling Han clearly did not have a single new aperture opened.

Thus, he could only sit by and watch.

Whether he wa using mystical power as a guide or sat down to rest, the change in his level of being didn’t accelerate or decrease in the slightest.

It was as if he had become an outsider.

One, two, three, four, five… Ling Han counted in his mind. More and more shackles were unlocked, filling him with joy. Wasn’t this equivalent to a minor cultivation level upgrade? It was equivalent to him having an additional cultivation level. Though it was not as terrifying as the Seventh Change and the Seventh Extreme, it was still extremely beneficial.

If he had previously been a four-star genius, then he could possibly have reached four point three stars by now, or even four point five stars.

In less than twenty minutes, the effects of the celestial fruit had disappeared.

Ling Han smacked his lips. Though this taste was extremely unpalatable, he did not mind eating another… if he really could, he could eat until he was stuffed.

However, this was naturally wishful thinking.

Furthermore, even if there really was an endless supply of celestial fruits, there was still limited space for his improvement. That was because even for celestial fruits, the effects would be the greatest during the first time of consumption. In future, they would be continuously halved, and after a few times, the effects would be negligible.

Unless he could obtain higher level celestial fruits.

“Sigh, I will definitely be able to in future,” Ling Han thought. Of course, if he could cultivate all six levels below Celestial Path to perfection, and his level of being could not advance further, then there was naturally no need for him to ingest any more celestial fruits.

Peng!

The main doors were kicked open, and a man strode in.

Liu Jun.

Ling Han was like a lingering ghost. Just now, Ling Han had been experiencing a leap in his level of being, so he had naturally revealed his original appearance. He had almost failed to disguise himself in time.

Ling Han looked over, his gaze unfriendly.

“Hand over the Star Origin Fruit, and this sword control technique is yours!”

Liu Jun tossed out a book. Pa, it fell onto the ground.

Ling Han walked over and picked up the book. Someone had deliberately come to deliver something, so there was naturally no reason for him to refuse.

Seeing Ling Han put away his cultivation technique, Liu Jun revealed a cold smile. He was really a person who had not seen the world, and had sent him off with just a sword control technique. He humphed, and asked, “Where is the Star Origin Fruit?”

Ling Han smiled, then pointed at his own stomach.

F***,you ate it?

F***, then you still dare to put away the Sword Control Technique?

To him, though the Sword Control Technique was not all that valuable, it was still a secret technique, after all. He had paid a certain price to obtain it, so how could he give it away for nothing?

“Bast@rd, you dare to trick me?” he shouted lowly.

Ling Han, on the other hand, looked justified, and said, “I’m doing this for your own good. That Star Origin Fruit is extremely disgusting, sour and smelly. If you eat it, you’ll definitely throw up.”

■You’re still trying to take advantage of me even though you’ve already benefited!’

“Can Ye, you’ve gone too far!” Liu Jun said balefully. He was thinking, if he suddenly attacked now, would he be able to kill this guy?

“Hehe, we’re all family, Jun’er, don’t be rude!” Amidst a long laugh, a man descended from the skies.

Ling Han’s heart jolted. Could it be that this was him?

He looked over. This man had a jade-like face, and looked to be only in his forties. He had an incredibly refined air to him.

“Master!” Liu Jun hurriedly clasped his hands in greeting, then said, “This person toyed with your disciple like this, your disciple can’t bear it!

Liu Jun’s master was naturally the Primordial True Lord.

He smiled faintly, and said, “You think that losing to Can Ye is because he has a Battle Armor, and you don’t?”

Liu Jun was instantly unconvinced, and said, “Of course. In a fair battle, he is definitely no match for me.”

“Wrong, wrong.” The Primordial True Lord shook his head, “Putting aside the Celestial Tool factor, you indeed could fight Can Ye to a tie.

Then wasn’t the issue settled?

Liu Jun glared at Ling Han. The Primordial Sect only had a Two Star Divine Tree. According to the Primordial True Lord, the tree would only be able to bear a single Star Origin Fruit every ten years. Ten years later, perhaps the next Star Origin Fruit would still belong to him, but consuming it under the Celestial Path, and consuming it after he had attained the Celestial Path, the effects would be different.

Furthermore, even if it was the same, he would have one less important leap in level of being in these ten years. Perhaps, there would be some difficulties that he would not be able to break through, or there would be some strong opponents that he would not be able to defeat.

This was far too important.

The more he thought about it, the more furious he became. He glared angrily at Ling Han.

The Primordial True Lord smiled faintly, and said, “So, in a fair battle, you’re no match for Can Ye.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yi, what kind of tongue twister was this?

Liu Jun looked at his master in surprise. ‘You already said that putting aside the Celestial Tool factor, my abilities are on par with Ling Han’s. So, why are you saying that I’m no match for him in a fair battle?’

He was completely confused.

“Idiot, Can Ye is still only in the Enlightenment Tier.” The Primordial True Lord finally revealed the truth. He was in the Spiritual Transformation Tier, so it could not be more natural that he could tell Ling Han’s true cultivation level.

Liu Jun instantly inhaled sharply.

What, Ling Han was actually only an Enlightenment Tier?

How could this be? How could an Enlightenment Tier cultivator fight him to a tie? There couldn’t be such a freak in this world!

However, would the Primordial True Lord make an error of judgement? Would he deceive him?

Only now did he understand the true meaning of the Primordial True Lord’s words about a fair battle. He was no match for Ling Han. If he suppressed his cultivation level to Enlightenment Tier, how could he possibly be a match for Ling Han?

The gulf between them wasn’t just a tiny bit. Rather, it was like the gulf between heaven and earth.

He was despondent. This blow was really too great, and he could not accept it. The Primordial True Lord looked towards Ling Han and said, “Can Ye, are you willing to take me as Master?”

Thoughts streaked through Ling Han’s mind as he clasped his hands and replied, “Of course I’m willing.”

“Hahahaha!” the Primordial True Lord laughed loudly, “All right, all right, one month later, I will host a disciple recruitment ceremony for you, and invite the whole world.”

This disciple’s aptitude was too good. He definitely had to use this opportunity to make an announcement to the whole world, firstly, to show off, and secondly, to tell the others not to have any ideas about him.

Liu Jun had just come back to his senses, and when he heard these words, he instantly suffered another 10,000 points of damage. He really wanted to throw up blood..
