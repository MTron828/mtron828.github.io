Chapter 580: Victorious

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“You usually always use palms because you encountered a bottleneck in the way of the saber. That’s why you changed to cultivating palm techniques, wanting to comprehend by analogy and thus obtain a breakthrough in the way of the saber, achieving 30 flashes of Saber Qi,” Ling Han said while fighting.

“That’s right!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang didn’t deny it. “Everyone thinks that 29 flashes of Qi is the limit, but I know that 30 flashes is the real completion. With my talents, I obviously need to reach perfection!”

Ling Han nodded lightly. The reason why the Mysterious Three Thousand was Three Thousand and not Three Thousand One Hundred was because it assumed that 29 flashes of Qi was the limit martial artists could cultivate.

However, limits were to be broken, or else how would one know what a limit really was?

“Lose!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang charged up, closing the distance with Ling Han on his own accord; clearly, he was confident in his current strength. Of course, closing in wasn’t to fight hand-to-hand with Ling Han, but to control the distance at about a meter or so, allowing Saber Qi to showcase its greatest power.

Ling Hans swung his sword in counter, and laughed loudly. “I complemented you twice, and you really think I’m afraid of you?”

Hong, a thick long flash of Sword Qi erupted. This was also a combined Sword Qi, and it also had the addition of a bone pattern, which substantially increased its power. Like a dragon, it slashed towards Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

“Saber breaks heaven and earth, I’m lord of the world!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang shouted loudly, and the saber’s momentum instantly increased greatly. The baleful saber intent seemed as if it could cut open the heavens.

This saber strike was very strong!

Ling Han carried out Desolate Hell Sword art, and a sky-ful of sword lights spread out, enveloping him tightly and forming a super-strong defense.

This sword art’s forte was its defense to begin with; on top of Ling Han’s current battle prowess, obviously not even a drop of water would trickle through.

Hong!

The sword and saber collided, and the martial intents also collided fiercely; this could be called the strongest battle in the level of the Flower Blossom Tier.

“A similar Flower Blossom Tier, so why is the difference in strength so great?” The other people who were invited to participate in the contest cried out one after another. Comparing their strength, this difference was not just a tiny bit—they didn’t even have the courage to catch up.

This shocked their confidence too much.

Pang Xiang Rong clenched his fists tightly and encouraged himself on the inside. He would definitely surpass these two people... definitely!

The two geniuses unleashed their radiance to their hearts’ content as if they were two suns shining on earth. This battle wouldn’t effect their reputation no matter victory or defeat; the victor would simply shine brighter.

“Amongst this generation’s geniuses, a figure that will surpass the millennia old and raise the extreme might appear, shining for ten millennia and leading martial arts,” a figure of the older generation exclaimed. They advanced step by step, and when they climbed to the Flower Blossom Tier, they were at least sixty to seventy years old. At that time, the body’s functions were already on decline, and even if one advanced to the Flower Blossom Tier and revived one’s vigor, they couldn’t be compared to a person who broke through at twenty to thirty years old.

A martial artist’s entire life was to compete against time, rushing to break through one stage after another when their Qi and blood was the most vigorous. If one couldn’t catch up to time, they could only be eliminated by time.

“Buddha’s Saber Slash!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang unleashed another great move. As the saber slashed out, there was the actually the image of Buddha’s mercifulness and compassion for all beings accompanying it.

Ling Han snorted—roaring once whenever unleashing a move, how annoying could you get!? However, Xuanyuan Zi Guang couldn’t release a true killer move because of pressure Ling Han put on him; the latter similarly didn’t have any spare strength to use the Mysterious Three Thousand. It couldn’t be helped; there was no spare energy to accumulate power, since the battle was too fierce. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If someone still had spare strength to unleash an ultimate move, then it proved one point—the opponent wasn’t strong enough, failing to prevent it.

However, both parties didn’t dare to spare strength, lest they were crushingly defeated without unleashing their ultimate move as they held back.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang frequently launched powerful moves to suppress Ling Han. This way, he could also accumulate some power for an ultimate move.

Ling Han wouldn’t possibly give him the chance. After guarding against a powerful move, he raised his right hand and used the Desolate Hell Sword’s strongest killer move, forcibly interrupting Xuan Yuan Zi Guang’s power accumulation.

They battled fiercely, equally matched all along; the battle was at a stalemate.

“I’m invincible!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang roared angrily. The power of the bloodline activated, and endless flames rushed out from within his body. They turned into waves of raging fire and formed true dragons, true phoenixes, and other ancient divine beasts that surrounded his body, their auras shocking.

His battle prowess instantly rocketed, breaking through the level of the Flower Blossom Tier and advancing into the Spiritual Infant Tier.

Ling Han snorted, and said, “I was waiting for you!” He took out a medicinal pill from behind his back and threw it in his mouth.

It was the Five Turns Black Jade Pill—precisely what he had refined a few days ago.

This was a high-level Earth Grade medicinal pill which allowed Deity Transformation Tier warriors to increase by five stars their battle prowess, and seven stars in case of the Spiritual Infant Tier ones. Theoretically speaking, Flower Blossom Tier elites couldn’t take it, because the increase in power was too much—it would forcefully burst their body. However, Ling Han cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and reached the level of Iron Sheet Body, being completely capable of withstanding such medicinal power.

Hong, his aura also began to rocket upwards.

Theoretically, the Five Turns Black Jade Pill could empower the Flower Blossom Tier elites by adding roughly ten stars of battle prowess... the condition was that one could withstand such violent medicinal power; Ling Han’s battle prowess originally surpassed fifteen stars, and increasing by another ten stars of battle prowess obviously meant he advanced into the Spiritual Infant Tier.

The two great geniuses continued to exchange blows, and Ling Han had the advantage!

After Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s power of the bloodline was activated, it could add roughly five stars of battle prowess, pushing him into the Spiritual Infant Tier. However, Ling Han, whose battle prowess was originally equivalent to his, gained ten more stars of battle prowess.

This difference was an entire five stars of battle prowess!

Of course, their battle prowess already advanced into the Spiritual Infant Tier. Five Stars’ difference in the Flower Blossom Tier placed in the Spiritual Infant Tier would shrink abruptly to half a star, but for two geniuses matched in strength, was half a star’s difference not enough to determine who was superior?

An advantage didn’t represent a victory, but after Ling Han had the advantage, he had the spare power to accumulate power to unleash an ultimate move.

10,000 Techniques Return to One!

Ling Han condensed the 23 flashes of Sword Qi into a pseudo-Ray, and as his sword struck out, a Sword Ray shot out. It was only the thickness of a finger, yet it emitted a frightening chill, slashing towards Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

It couldn’t be dodged!

Xuanyuan Zi Guang immediately realized it. This sword attack already locked onto him, and it was extremely fast; it definitely couldn’t be dodged.

He shouted loudly, and placed the saber horizontally before his chest, doing his utmost to resist.

The Sword Ray swept by, and Xuanyuan Zi Guang was sent flying. Like a kite with a severed string, he fell heavily onto the ground, hacking out blood violently. Lowering his head for a glance, he saw the saber actually had a shallow mark.

He still wanted to battle, but as he took a stride, another mouthful of blood spurted out. He slumped onto the ground, without the strength to stand.

If it weren’t for the extremely high level of the treasured saber in his hand, the 10,000 Techniques Return to One would have slashed him into two parts.

In the two great geniuses’ battle, Ling Han was slightly better in the end.

“This isn’t fair!” Yin Le immediately shouted, pointed at Ling Han, and said, “He took a medicinal pill, which is against the rules!”
