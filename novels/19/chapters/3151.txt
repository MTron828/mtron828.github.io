3152 Divine Intent Disc

Lian Xuerong didn’t spend much effort on this matter. This matter was insignificant, and she was only curious for a while.

“What business do you have with me that you seek an audience with me?” she asked coldly.

“Oh.” Ling Han nodded, “I would like to ask the Banner Lord if there is any cultivation technique that cultivates Spiritual Power?”

“What do you want this kind of cultivation technique for?” Lian Xuerong revealed a curious expression.

“Isn’t this cultivating formations, which requires spiritual power?” Ling Han said.

“You’ve actually learnt it?” Ling Xuerong was truly shocked this time. She had initially thought that Ling Han was biting off more than he could chew, and after studying it for a while, he would give up on it.

Yet Ling Han actually asked her for the cultivation technique of Spiritual Power, which also meant that he really wanted to learn formations.

Hiss, you freak.

She shook her head, “There are pitifully few cultivation techniques of Spiritual Power. They are all grasped in the hands of the Formation Masters, and would definitely not be taught to outsiders.”

In other words, unless he became the disciple of these people, it was definitely impossible for him to to be taught such a technique.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel gloomy. He didn’t want to acknowledge anyone as Master.

“Furthermore, there are pitifully few people who can cultivate Spiritual Power.” Lian Xuerong continued, “This requires natural talent. If one in ten people can walk on the path of martial arts, then there may not be one in ten thousand who can cultivate Spiritual Power, and only those who have cultivated Spiritual Power can take the path of formations.”

She glanced at Ling Han, changed the topic, and said, “However, if you really want to give it a try, there’s a way.”

“Hold on.”

She began to rummage through her belongings, searching for something.

At first, Ling Han wasn’t very concerned, but when he occasionally looked at Lian Xuerong, he suddenly felt heat rise up within him.

F***, this seductive beauty was actually looking for something with her behind raised. The leather cloth tightly wrapped around that shapely bottom, making one burn with heat.

Ling Han hurriedly turned his head, murmuring ‘strange’ inwardly. What kind of temperament did he have? How could he lose his cool so easily?

Could it be that as his cultivation level had been weakened, his self-control had also decreased? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After a while, Lian Xuerong finally found what she was looking for. She walked over and threw a disc at Ling Han. It was made of metal, and when it hit the table, a crisp ‘peng’ sound was heard.

“This is a tool used by a Formation Master to select disciples, and is called the Divine Intent Disc.” Lian Xuerong explained, “Those who have natural talent in this area can use this item to cultivate a shred of Spiritual Power.”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and picked up the disc to take a look. It was as thin as a mirror. One side was smooth, and the other side was like a labyrinth, covered with veined patterns. When his eyes focused on it, after a while, he would discover that these veined patterns were actually moving.

“I would advise you not to bite off more than you can chew. Although being a Formation Master is extremely rare and has a high status, attaining that requires natural talent, and it is not something that can be achieved just through your hard work,” Lian Xuerong said seriously.

“I understand.” Ling Han nodded.

Lian Xuerong waved her hand dismissively, indicating that Ling Han could leave now. She only had to look at the expression on his face when he answered, and she knew that this guy had not taken her words to heart at all.

Forget it. In a few days, when he hit a wall, he would naturally know that martial arts was the only way for him.

——Just look at the current Emperor. His cultivation was exceptional, and his dominance was unmatched in the world. Did he need to cultivate formations as well as a foil for himself?

Ling Han brought the disc back with him, and began looking at it.

Lian Xuerong didn’t say what to do specifically, but rather simply staring at it would do.

Ling Han stared at it. Those dense veined patterns seemed to have a life of their own, and were twisting slightly.

Was this a visual side effect caused by staring at it for too long?

Ling Han thought internally, but when he channelled the mystical power in his body into his eyes, he still discovered that those veined patterns were moving.

“No, it’s really moving.”

“There should be a small formation set up inside this disc.”

As he watched, he felt like something in his body had been stimulated, but he could not put his finger on exactly what it was.

Yi?

He shockingly discovered that a small white dot had appeared on the circular disc at some point in time.

He stretched out his hand to touch it, yet discovered that it was out of reach.

He retracted his hand, and the white dot was still there.

This was…?

An enlightenment came upon Ling Han. Should he use Spiritual power to touch it?

He tried to push it, but the white dot did not move at all.

His determination firmed!

Ling Han’s interest was piqued. He had a very bad temper, and the more difficult problems he encountered, the more motivated he became.

‘I don’t believe that I can’t move you.’

Ling Han tried to use his spiritual power to stimulate this white dot. In the Genesis World, his spiritual power was undoubtedly the number one in the world. Despite now that it had disappeared with the decrease in his own cultivation level, compared to ordinary people, he still knew how to mobilize his spiritual power.

However, perhaps he didn’t have any spiritual power now, or perhaps his spiritual power was too weak. The white dot didn’t move at all.

Once Ling Han’s temper flared up, he couldn’t care about anything else. Aside from eating and drinking, and the fact that he had to cultivate for half an hour every day, he simply held on to this disc, as if it was his lover.

He did not just stay in his room. Sometimes, he would also sit at the bow of the ship, or at the side of the pool.

As time passed, rumors spread.

“Hey, hey, hey. Do you guys know? The new deputy captain has a crush on the Banner Lord.”

“Isn’t that very normal? Our Banner Lord is so beautiful, and her figure is so voluptuous. Who wouldn’t like her?”

“This is different. That guy is holding on to the Divine Intent Disc that Banner Lord has given him, and is daydreaming all day.”

“F***, such deep yearning to the point of being engraved to the bones?”

“He’s treating the Divine Intent Disc as the Banner Lord.”

“Sigh, what a pitiful guy. He actually fell in love with our Banner Lord. He would be destined to be alone for his whole life.”

All the warriors thought that Ling Han was madly infatuated with Lian Xuerong, and that was why he had deliberately asked Lian Xuerong for a token, to look at it and think of her.

Wang Feng and the others all ran over to comfort Ling Han. They all patted Ling Han’s shoulder, looking at him like he needed to pull himself together. There were plenty of fish in the sea, so why did he have to hang on to this one that had spikes? This would cause himself be pierced through with many bloody holes on his entire body.

How could Ling Han be in the mood to pay attention to them? He merely held on to the disc, and was filled with such determination in his heart, and the reason being that he was set on pushing this white dot forwards.

Wang Feng and the others all shook their heads. Damn, his guy was already so deeply entrenched in sh*t and could not be pulled out.

“Sigh, brother, take care of yourself!”

Several more days passed, and those who had returned to deal with the trivial matters of the sects all returned. With these mighty figures personally dealing with it, the matter of surrendering naturally went very smoothly.

“Young Master!” The little female attendant was also brought over. When she saw Ling Han at the bow of the ship, she couldn’t help but feel delighted.

But what was wrong with Young Master?

He was hugging a strange disc, as if it was some kind of treasure, and was completely ignoring her.

“Hey, are you this guy’s female attendant?” Wang Feng asked.

“That’s right.” Huan Xue puffed up her chest, appearing very proud.

“Sigh, better go and persuade your Young Master. He’s about to go crazy,” Wang Feng said.

“What’s wrong with Young Master?” Huan Xue couldn’t help but become anxious. She grabbed Wang Feng’s arm and shook it vigorously.
