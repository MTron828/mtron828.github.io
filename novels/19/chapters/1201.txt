Chapter 1202: The Hua Faction Makes Their Move

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhou Tong left, bringing with him fury and Ling Han’s answer. As a great elite of Sun Moon Tier, he was actually threatened up front by a Mountain River Tier. This made him very displeased, but who asked him to come up himself and offer himself up to be insulted? If he reported this to the sect, it would only be disadvantageous to him.

As long as Ling Han was a seed, he was not someone that could be lightly insulted.

The news that the Mo Clan Establishment would be auctioning off the Thousand Source True Fluid very soon caused a commotion, and this auction had also obtained the full support of the Mo Clan. They had mobilized the full power of the clan to advertise this matter. Thus, very soon, the news had spread all over the entire galaxy.

Even a great many elites of Heavenly Body Tier were attracted.

The Thousand Source True Fluid was formed from an elite of the Eternal River Tier, containing comprehension of the heaven and earth of this level. Even for Heavenly Body Tiers, this was a precious treasure!

It might not be able to make a cultivator at the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier break through to the Eternal River Tier, but it was still very possible for it to help one in the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier to break through to the medium extreme, or one in the medium extreme to advance into the high extreme, and so on.

And what did this kind of advancement mean?

A revolutionary change would take place in one’s abilities, and his lifespan would also be increased by another 10,000,000 years!

10,000,000 years!

With such a long period of time, perhaps he could obtain a new fated opportunity, and advance into a higher cultivation level.

Thus, not only Sun Moon Tiers were moved, even a great many Heavenly Body Tiers had begun to set out towards Flying Cloud Planet. This was also the reason why the auction was scheduled for three months later: it was to allow enough time for the bankrollers to come.

Of course, the Mo Clan had also invited some alchemists. This group was the true rich group. For the sake of an ancient pill recipe, they would definitely place a high bid that would make one gape in shock.

Ling Han did not need to do anything. He had already delegated the full responsibility for arranging the auction to Han Huo. He would only have to hand over the Thousand Source True Fluid and other items over to Han Huo on the day of the auction—he did not hand them over yet, because the goods would be safest with Ling Han.

Because of how valuable the Thousand Source True Fluid was, the auction had instantly become the hottest topic of conversation. However, the movement from the Gao Faction was also getting bigger and bigger. Obviously, they were planning to subdue Ling Han before the auction itself. Otherwise, if the goods were already on the stage of the auction, they could only compete with their wealth.

However, the Majestic Heaven Sect was not a place that the Gao Faction had full control of.

“Senior Brother Han!” On this night, a guest came to pay him a visit.

Fan Ru led the guest in. She was an enchanting and exquisite beauty, with a voluptuous figure and so bewitching that she could have been dripping water. She curtsied to Ling Han, and said, “I am Ji Yunzhi.”

“Junior Sister Ji. What is it?” Ling Han asked casually as if he had completely not realized that the person standing in front of him was a vixen that could make anyone’s heart throb and face blush. Fan Ru, who was standing on the sidelines, dared not look directly at Ji Yunzhi, afraid that even his spirit would be hooked.

Ji Yunzhi was surprised. She was naturally very clear how enchanting she was. This was not only because she was naturally beautiful, and had also deliberately gone the route of becoming more seductive later. It was also because the cultivation technique she was cultivating would allow her to be even more dazzling and bewitching. Every move she made would be exuding seduction.

But Ling Han actually did not even look at her directly, which was something she could not accept.

Usually, men would want nothing more than to have their eyes glued to her, but Ling Han was the complete opposite. He seemed too lazy to even cast a second look on her.

She calmed herself, and said, “I am here by command of Hua Yangwen, Young Master Hua, hoping to ask for a small favor from Brother Ling and see if you could sell a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid to the Hua Faction.”

“Hua Faction?” Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. After he had made an enemy of the Gao Faction, he had conducted his own investigation, and knew that there was a disciple called Hua Yongning who was ranked sixth among Venerable Trinity’s nine disciples.

Then this Hua Faction was naturally formed by Hua Yongning. Additionally, Gao Fang was ranked fourth among the nine disciples. Though this was only in the order in which they took him as master, in a certain way, it was also the power ranking of their respective factions.

“Hehe, Young Master would definitely not allow Senior Brother Ling to make a loss.” Ji Yunzhi smiled sweetly. “What Young Master means is, Senior Brother Ling needs only auction off three drops of Thousand Source True Fluid, and Young Master would purchase a drop at the same price as the lowest successful bid among these three drops.”

This indeed could not be considered a loss to Ling Han, because if the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid were really auctioned off together, then the cheapest drop might be sold lower than the lowest successful bid in the case of three drops being auctioned off together. After all, the smaller the supply, the fiercer the competition would be.

“For my sake, the Hua Faction would turn hostile with the Gao Faction?” Ling Han asked.

“Hehe, any faction is filled with competition. As the saying goes, the weak are prey to the strong, and survival of the fittest reigns supreme,” Ji Yunzhi said calmly. “Among the Venerable’s nine disciples, only one would be able to obtain the final true inheritance, and shoulder the great responsibility of leading the Majestic Heaven Sect.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“So... even if it is not for the sake of Senior Brother Han, the battle between the Hua Faction and Gao Faction is inevitable.”

Ling Han nodded. The lower ranks had their own competition, and the upper ranks would also have the struggle of the upper ranks.

How much envy would the inheritance of Eternal River Tier garner? If one obtained it, he might perhaps be capable of conquering this whole universe, and become the only ruler. How many people would be able to resist this kind of temptation? No wonder those nine disciples all formed their respective factions. Their aim was to increase their own stakes so they could obtain the inheritance.

However, Venerable Trinity had not made his stand clear all this while, and even had plans to take Yang Hao as his 10th disciple. This was actually giving off the signal that Venerable Trinity was not very satisfied with these nine disciples.

Even though the nine disciples were all fighting fiercely now, when the time came, it could be completely wasted effort, and they wouldn’t be getting anything.

Ling Han smiled. What relation did this have with him?

He pondered for a moment, and then said, “All right. I can retain a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid for Young Master Hua!”

In any case, it was no loss to him.

“Senior Brother Han is truly a man of firm temperament. I shall first offer my thanks on behalf of Young Master!” Ji Yunzhi stood up, and curtsied again to Ling Han. Her head and neck was low, revealing the snow white of her breasts. The part that swelled was voluptuous and grand.

What a seductive beauty that could ignite flames!

Ling Han’s expression was serene. Constantly being seduced by a great vixen like Shui Yanyu, he had naturally gained a strong immunity. Furthermore, in comparison with the exquisite beauty and charm of Empress Luan Xing, Ji Yunzhi was only on the level of a village girl. How could he possibly be disturbed?

Ji Yunzhi raised her head, and when she saw that Ling Han’s expression was calm, without the slightest sign of his heart beating faster or being breathless in excitement, she couldn’t help but feel extremely curious.

According to her understanding, Ling Han should have reacted by now, and embarrassed himself and become obedient in front of her. Then she would be able to get the upper hand psychologically. If she then set out some conditions, Ling Han would agree without the slightest hesitation due to his flustered state.

Did this guy not like women?

Ji Yunzhi was making her guesses internally, but it was naturally impossible that she would ask this question out loud. She continued talking, and took advantage of the opportunity to seduce Ling Han a few more times, but all her attempts ended in failure. Thus, she could only leave helplessly.

“What nice breasts!” Old Ginseng popped up from who knew where, looking like it was gritting its teeth at Ling Han. “That little ***** was obviously seducing you, so why didn’t you just take her? Even if you wouldn’t, you should still have had her take off her clothes so you could allow this Grandpa Ginseng to have an eyeful!”

“Get lost!” Ling Han shot out a kick. This perverted ginseng was definitely incurable.
