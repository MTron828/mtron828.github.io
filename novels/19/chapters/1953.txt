Chapter 1954: Revered by Everyone

Some people were unaware of this situation, so they couldn’t help but falter upon walking over.

‘What’s going on? Why are there so many people?’

Cultivators naturally had no interest in alchemy. They couldn’t understand Ling Han’s utterances, either. Thus, they would immediately turn around and leave. However, it was a completely different story for alchemists. They were immediately engrossed by Ling Han’s explanations, and they would involuntarily sit down to carefully listen to his remarks.

This was a very strange scene. There was clearly a sea of people, yet the surroundings were especially quiet and tranquil. Apart from Ling Han’s voice, no one else made any sound. They all wore expressions of respect and reverence as they fervently gazed at Ling Han. It was as if they were worshipping a divine deity.

In some sense, Ling Han was indeed a god in alchemy.

Only when the grand ceremony was about to begin did Ling Han finally conclude his explanation. Everyone stood up with an expression of yearning. Regardless of who it was, they all bowed deeply to Ling Han. Even Three-Star Alchemists were no exception.

In terms of grasping the fundamentals, Ling Han’s understanding had already exceeded that of most Three-Star Alchemists. Thus, even Three-Star Alchemists had learned a lot by listening to his explanations. As such, they couldn’t help but pay Ling Han their highest respects.

They were convinced that Ling Han would definitely become a grandmaster in the future. In fact, he might even create history and fill the gap in alchemy in the Eastern Celestial Realm. He might become the first Five-Star Alchemist in 100 billion years.

They couldn’t help but go numb with excitement upon thinking of this. Perhaps today’s gathering would also be recorded in history forever, representing Ling Han’s initial rise in the Celestial Realm.

Liu Xing was left wide-eyed with shock and disbelief.

He had come here to humiliate Ling Han, yet after half a day, he had instead given Ling Han a chance to gain fame and renown?

Just look! Just how popular and reputable was Ling Han now?

Just how foolish had Liu Xing been? Just how incredibly foolish had he been? It was actually he who had pushed Ling Han onto this divine pedestal! He was so vexed that his mouth was about to go crooked.

Pa!

At this moment, he suddenly felt a heavy weight landing on his shoulder. He looked over, only to see a hand.

“Live an honest life, and focus more of your attention on alchemy. Cultivate your heart, and learn to be a decent person,” Ling Han said. This was a piece of advice from the bottom of his heart.

He wasn’t a petty person. Liu Xing was already working toward becoming a Three-Star Alchemist at such a young age, and this was something that was worthy of praise. Thus, he advised Liu Xing to cultivate his heart and personality now. Otherwise, if Liu Xing hadn’t been so talented, he wouldn’t have even wasted his breath. He would have directly pummeled Liu Xing into smithereens.

Liu Xing flushed red with embarrassment, and he didn’t dare to look Ling Han in the eyes.

Ling Han patted Liu Xing’s shoulders again before confidently striding away. He didn’t pay any more attention to him.

“Grandmaster Ling!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Grandmaster Ling!”

Wherever Ling Han passed, the surrounding alchemists would all look over and greet him with a sincere smile.

Even though Ling Han was still very far away from becoming a grandmaster, his explanations just then had elicited a strong feeling of respect from everyone. He was a selfless person, and he had shared his understanding of alchemy with everyone else. He had allowed all of them to reap huge benefits.

Zhu Feng’s two senior brothers had also personally come to congratulate him on reaching the Sixth Refinement. They pulled Ling Han over to chitchat with him, mainly asking about how Grandmaster Zi Cheng was currently doing.

Among Ling Han’s three senior brothers, the older they were, the smaller their achievements in alchemy. For example, even though both his first senior brother and second senior brother were Four-Star Alchemists, they had only mastered the Fifth Spirit Refinement, and had just barely entered the realm of grandmasters.

Zhang Ning, Ling Han’s first senior brother, most likely wouldn’t be able to reach the Sixth Refinement. Meanwhile, Xiao Lixing, his second senior brother, still had a sliver of hope. However, it was actually Zhu Feng, his third senior brother, who had successfully taken this step first. He had already mastered the Sixth Refinement.

Ling Han chitchatted with his three senior brothers for a long time. Afterward, Zhang Ning and Xiao Lixing both invited Ling Han to their residences. Ling Han happily accepted their invitations. However, regarding when he would visit them, this was hard to say. After all, he was also a very busy person.

The grand celebration continued for five entire days. When it concluded, Ling Han hurriedly set off again, with his destination being the Three Blooms Valley.

Strictly speaking, the Three Blooms Valley belonged inside the territory of the Calm Peace Heaven. However, wherever there were borders, there were naturally conflicts over claims. Moreover, the Three Blooms Valley was on the outer edge of the Calm Peace Heaven, so it was only natural that it was disputed by the bordering heaven.

Otherwise, the Celestial King of the Wide Prosperity Heaven wouldn’t have “accidentally” discovered the Three Blooms Valley and the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood.

Ling Han and the others set off, and Bewitching Maiden Rou continued to shamelessly travel with them. This caused Hu Niu to continually glare at her. How could there be such a shameless person? If it weren’t for the Empress stopping her, she would truly want to pummel Bewitching Maiden Rou into a pig head. She would then toss her as far away as she could.

Under Hu Niu’s disdain, the group of them traversed through mountains and waters for almost three months. Only then did they finally exit the Wide Prosperity Heaven and return to the Calm Peace Heaven. They then continued westward for another month before finally arriving at the Three Blooms Valley.

‘Is this truly a valley?’

Ling Han gazed at the swarming clouds and mists before him. This valley was as vast as a sea, and there was simply no end in sight. The clouds and mists were like the waves of the sea, slightly undulating as they flowed. This was a magnificent sight.

Among this vast “sea”, one could see three distinct mountain peaks. They looked much like three blooming petals, and it was from this that the Three Blooms Valley had received its name.

Boom!

A “wave” suddenly crashed over from the distance. This was a gust of wind. Upon wrapping around a cloud, it formed a peculiar and spectacular spectacle.

However, the expressions of Ling Han and the others involuntarily changed.

This gust of wind was far too terrifying. There were symbols of the great dao swarming inside it, with each of them being paramount and profound. These were symbols that could easily shatter the heavens.

“Celestial King Symbols!” they all exclaimed in astonishment.

No wonder the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King had said that even Celestial Kings couldn’t forcefully obtain the rare opportunity of this place. Just a simple gust of wind was already like the frenzied attack of a Celestial King. Even an Ascending Origin Tier elite would instantly die upon coming into contact with such a gust of wind. As for Celestial Kings... They wouldn’t know which heaven these gusts of wind were equivalent to.

In any case, only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could laugh before the might of heaven and earth and peer down on all matter. Only they could enjoy equal standing with the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Ling Han and the others attempted to enter the valley, yet symbols of the great dao would flash into appearance from time to time. These symbols were powerful enough to obliterate all matter, so Ling Han and the others naturally didn’t dare to recklessly push forward.

Right now, no one could enter this valley.

Celestial Kings could most likely enter this valley, but they definitely couldn’t venture into its depths, either. The will of heaven and earth was transcendent above all matter.

According to rumors, there were very specific ways to enter this valley. One couldn’t find any random place to jump down. There were petrifying Regulations of Gravity here, and the bottom of the valley was more so filled with a forest of razor-sharp stones that was imbued with the symbols of the great dao. If one were impaled, they would instantly die on the spot. Even a physique as freakish as Ling Han’s would be useless.

Thus, they definitely had to find the correct entrance. Only by following this path could they safely arrive at the bottom of the valley. At that time, they could then look for the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood.

After walking around for several days, Ling Han and the others finally found the correct entrance. At this moment, many people had already arrived before this entrance. Some of them Ling Han recognized, while some of them he didn’t recognize.

“Brother Ling!” Yan Xianlu and Liu Jie called as they walked over in unison. When they noticed each other, they couldn’t help but falter and look over.

‘What’s going on?

‘Why is he also greeting Ling Han?’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Brother Yan, Brother Liu.”

“Huh? Brother Ling, how do you know him?” Yan Xianlu and Liu Jie asked in unison.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I took a trip to Guanhua City, and I became acquainted with Brother Liu there.”

“What? You’re genuinely from the Calm Peace Heaven?” At this moment, Liu Jie naturally understood everything. He immediately recalled Ling Han insisting that he was from the Calm Peace Heaven. At that time, no one had believed him. In fact, even he had thought that Ling Han was purposefully making up an excuse to turn down his offer. He had even been slightly displeased at that time. However, who would have thought that this was actually true?

Gasp!
