Chapter 2259: Full-scale Battle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Chi Xue roared in rage. He didn’t want to lose.

At the same cultivation level, only he had the right to crush others!

Boom!

He truly combusted his ancestral bloodline, causing a burst of mysterious power to course through his body. This was a tremendous power that transcended the Regulations.

Ling Han was instantly seized by a feeling of rising discomfort. It was as if someone were challenging him.

He immediately understood the situation. The power within Chi Xue’s body had most likely exceeded the level of a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. As such, it was unwelcome by this heaven and earth, which desired to quash it. However, with a single thought, he forcefully suppressed the urge of the Regulations.

Chi Xue had only combusted his ancestral bloodline, so Ling Han refused to believe that he could directly rival Heavenly Venerate elites.

This was indeed impossible. Chi Xue’s battle prowess rose several folds under the influence of this power, yet he could at most only advance from the small accomplishment of the Ascending Origin Tier to the great accomplishment of the Ascending Origin Tier. Even so, this was a terrifying rise of 100-fold.

Ling Han also joined the act, saying, “You think that only you possess a secret technique?” With a roar, his body was instantly intertwined with arcs of blinding white lightning. “God of Lightning, bestow upon me your strength!”

Boom!

His aura soared, and even though his cultivation level remained the same, his battle prowess rose to a level similar to that of Chi Xue’s

Upon seeing this, Hu Niu couldn’t help but clap her hands and laugh out loud.

Ling Han was truly so amusing.

Meanwhile, Chi Xue was so enraged that he almost suffered internal injuries. Ling Han was definitely doing this on purpose. So be it if he activated a secret technique, but was there any need for such exaggerated shouting?

“You’ve enraged me! You’ve truly enraged me!” Chi Xue roared. He shook his fists, unleashing wisps of divine light. Right now, his battle prowess could definitely rival those at the great accomplishment of the Ascending Origin Tier.

However, Ling Han was unfazed, and he continued to trade blows with Chi Xue.

Both of them had unleashed their secret techniques, and both of them were unleashing their physical might. They clashed head-on, and their battle was as ferocious as could be.

Ling Han became increasingly powerful as the battle dragged on, and he eventually regained his advantage even though Chi Xue had become 100 times more powerful. Moreover, this was an absolute advantage.

At this moment, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm looked as if they had lost their parents.

How was this possible?

This was the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate, someone who could be regarded as an invincible Monarch Star. Yet, even after combusting his ancestral bloodline, he was still losing to measly trash from the Celestial Realm? How could they accept this?

Not only were they astounded, but even the Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm wore dark expressions.

They could understand Ji Wuming’s power, but just how in the world was Ling Han so freakish?

A Celestial King from the Foreign Realm immediately lashed out. At this moment, he was in no mood to care for the rules anymore. Instead, there was only a single thought in his mind—he definitely couldn’t allow Ling Han to leave this realm alive. Otherwise, he would definitely become a great threat to the Foreign Realm.

Several epochs ago, the Celestial Realm had produced an outstanding individual who had obstructed the Foreign Realm’s advance with his strength alone. His actions had forced the Foreign Realm to spend the next few epochs stabilizing the connection point between the two realms, unable to launch any further invasion during this time.

This was a world where cultivators were paramount. One certainly couldn’t underestimate the influence of an elite. If given the opportunity, they could potentially overthrow the heavens.

“You dare?” The Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm naturally lashed out in reply. Ling Han had provided them with far too many surprises. As it turned out, there existed a prodigy who was even more freakish than Ji Wuming! That being the case, they naturally had to protect him at all costs. In the future, they would also have to nurture him while sparing no expenses. One day, he would stand alongside Ji Wuming to resist the invasion of the Foreign Realm.

“Humph! This brat dies today!” Several more elites from the Foreign Realm joined in on the conflict. Not only did they attack Ling Han, but even Ji Wuming became one of their targets.

The nine Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm all engaged in battle, protecting Ling Han and Ji Wuming with their full strength.

Whoosh!

The reinforcements from the Foreign Realm arrived. They were all at the Celestial King Tier, and they were more so all at the Fourteenth Lotus. This was the limit of what this heaven and earth could withstand.

“Where’s the reincarnation of the murderous Buddha King?” an elite from the Foreign Realm asked as he glanced around with raging killing intent in his eyes.

“Over there!” the nine Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm replied as they pointed at Ji Wuming. They then pointed at Ling Han, and said, “However, this brat is even more freakish! Even Chi Xue can’t rival him!”

“What?!” The Celestial Kings who had just arrived couldn’t help but exclaim in astonishment. This was far too astounding.

“Perhaps Chi Xue didn’t activate his ancestral bloodline?” they hurriedly said.

“He activated it… However, he was still outmatched!”

The newly arrived Celestial Kings were rendered speechless. However, their killing intent soared, and they hardened their resolve to kill Ling Han at all costs.

“Do you think there’s no one in the Celestial Realm?” At this moment, the reinforcements from the Celestial Realm also arrived. There were 34 Celestial Kings in total, and they ranged from the First Heaven to the Fifth Heaven in cultivation.

“Call for more reinforcements!” a Fourteenth Lotus elite from the Foreign Realm said with a humph. Competing in the number of Celestial Kings? What a hilarious joke! How many Celestial Kings could such a super low-level dimension possess? Meanwhile, how many did they possess?

They were on two completely different levels!

Ling Han was still waiting. Even though there were already 37 Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm, his ambition was even greater. He wanted to kill more.

The elites from both sides were engaged in an intense battle. One side attacked, while the other side defended.

“Gu Teng, you’re skilled in the Regulations of Space, so take these two away first!” a Celestial King shouted.

“Good idea!” a Celestial King immediately replied. His title was Gu Teng, and he was skilled in the Regulations of Space.

He immediately grabbed at Ling Han and Ji Wuming.

“In your dreams!” an elite from the Foreign Realm shouted as they immediately dashed forward to obstruct Gu Teng.

Many more Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm stepped forward to protect Ling Han and Ji Wuming, yet even more elites from the Foreign Realm charged forward, intent on killing the two of them.

In the end, Celestial King Gu Teng found no opportunity to grab Ling Han and Ji Wuming. Right now, the elites from the Foreign Realm were seemingly crazed as they attempted to kill these two prodigies. As a result, the Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm had no option but to defend with their full strength.

This was a ferocious battle that involved many Celestial Kings.

In fact, more and more Celestial Kings from both sides continued to join the battle, causing it to become increasingly violent and ferocious. In fact, it was so intense that even heaven and earth started to tremor as if it were going to shatter.

‘More, send a few more,’ Ling Han said in his mind. At the same time, he continued to disguise himself as an Eleventh Secret cultivator, someone who couldn’t threaten Celestial Kings at all.

The blood of Celestial Kings splattered through the sky.

Before long, the death of Celestial Kings also ensued. There were Celestial Kings from the Celestial Realm, and there were also Celestial Kings from the Foreign Realm.

If this were in the Celestial Realm, the death of Celestial Kings would trigger a reaction from heaven and earth, causing blood rain to fall. However, this realm was independent, so the death of Celestial Kings triggered no such reaction, regardless of whether the dying Celestial Kings were from the Celestial Realm or the Foreign Realm.

Celestial King blood drenched the sky. This was a petrifying sight, with each drop of blood containing devastating powers of Regulation that could easily kill a crowd of Ascending Origin Tier elites.

There were chaotic scenes, and those below the Celestial King Tier could only flee for their lives.

In order not to expose himself too soon, Ling Han also chose to flee. He avoided the hotspot of the battle. However, because he was one of the triggers for this battle, how could the elites from the Foreign Realm possibly allow him to flee? As such, many of them followed closely behind him.

He fled left and right, and he took this opportunity to draw Hu Niu and the others into the Black Tower. Meanwhile, the Rain Emperor seized this opportunity to participate in the battle. He was a natural-born fighter, and Ling Han was also unable to stop his second brother. Thus, he could only stay far away from him such that the Rain Emperor wouldn’t be dragged into the Celestial King Tier battle.

Of course, if the Rain Emperor truly faced perilous danger, Ling Han would naturally unleash his might earlier. In his eyes, nothing was more important than family and friends.

“Han Lin!” A figure appeared before Ling Han, blocking his path.

Ling Han was slightly surprised because this person was none other than Shen Chao.

He knew that Shen Chao was jealous of him, yet to target him at such a critical moment? This person was truly as petty as could be.

“What do you want?” he asked calmly.

“I’m here to kill you!” Shen Chao replied in a cold voice.
