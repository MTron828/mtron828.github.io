Chapter 2181: Planning for His Son

Ling Jianxue worked hard on cultivation inside the Black Tower.

All kinds of rare and valuable cultivation resources were funneled into him—high-level alchemical pills, Dragon Crystals, and all kinds of natural treasures. As long as he needed them, they would be immediately provided to him.

One day passed in the outside world, and this was equivalent to a whopping 100,000 days in the Black Tower.

Thus, in just 100 days in the outside world, Ling Jianxue had already reached the pinnacle of the Fourth Severance. He could already feel the barrier to the Fifth Severance.

This was inevitable. Ling Han, Hu Niu, and the Empress had all reached the Fifth Severance, so this allowed him to observe and learn from them all the time. He also possessed extraordinary talent himself, and he was able to utilize a boundless amount of cultivation resources. Thus, it would be strange if he couldn’t feel the barrier to the Fifth Severance.

He started to calm his mind, preparing to take that critical step.

Meanwhile, Ling Han stayed in the Cloud Treasure Hall all day every day, comprehending the celestial techniques of the Heavenly Saint Palace.

Initially, he had only wanted that omnipotent cultivation technique. However, since Mo Zhuo gave him permission to freely enter the Cloud Treasure Hall, he naturally wouldn’t waste this opportunity. He investigated and comprehended all kinds of celestial techniques.

‘I want to perfect the Fists of Fury, and create my own technique.’

Ling Han had a lofty ambition. Only the Dao that belonged to him was the most powerful Dao.

That omnipotent technique was called the Heaven Deceiving Technique, and this was an extremely mystical technique. Ling Han speculated that this technique hadn’t been created by the Heavenly Saint Celestial King. Rather, he had most likely obtained it from some unknown place. This technique had most likely been created by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, or perhaps even a Heavenly Venerate.

After reaching initial mastery of the Heaven Deceiving Technique, one could conceal their aura, and appear like an ordinary mortal. After reaching great mastery, one could emit an aura of any cultivation level that they wanted. Of course, this aura could only be equivalent to, or lower than, their own cultivation level. For example, an Immortal Palace Tier elite couldn’t emit the aura of a Celestial King.

After reaching consummate mastery, one could truly deceive heaven and earth. They could emit any aura that they wanted, and they could even disguise themselves as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. As long as they didn’t get into a conflict, no one would be able to see through them.

It was as he practiced this Heaven Deceiving Technique that Ling Han continued to comprehend and investigate the other celestial techniques in the Cloud Treasure Hall. In the end, he sacrificed all of this to form his own unique Dao.

Several days later, Ling Jianxue exited the Black Tower. He already possessed the confidence to reach the Fifth Severance.

“Are you certain?” Ling Han asked in a solemn voice.

This was his son, so he naturally had to be extremely careful. He couldn’t allow any accidents.

Ling Jianxue wore a proud smile as he said, “Don’t worry, Father!”

“Jianxue!” Helian Xunxue was still extremely worried. She had heard the Empress and Hu Niu say that the Fifth Severance was extremely difficult to reach. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so few Celestial Kings in the world.

“Mother, I know what I’m doing!” Ling Jianxue said in a confident voice.

“Alright, let’s head off.”

Placing Ling Jianxue into the Black Tower, Ling Han left the Heavenly Saint Palace, and arrived at a desolate and uninhabited location. Meanwhile, Ling Jianxue continued to charge at the Fifth Severance inside the Black Tower.

Two days later.

“Father, let me out!” Ling Jianxue shouted. A wild aura raged around his body.

Ling Han nodded, and he released Ling Jianxue from the Black Tower with a single thought.

Crack!

There was a rumble of thunder, and a boundless number of dark clouds swept over, forming heavenly tribulation. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ling Jianxue naturally possessed a Natural Peach Seal—it was given to him by Hu Niu.

Even though the Roc Palace had been flattened, a large majority of their treasures had been left with Hu Niu. This was the backup plan prepared by Long Yuexi because she believed in Ling Han.

Ling Jianxue soared into the sky, actively flying toward his heavenly tribulation.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Devastating arcs of lightning continued to strike down. The Fifth Severance was far too important as it signified that one could definitely become a Celestial King, Thus, the tribulation that descended from heaven and earth would also be especially powerful, and perhaps even severe. Without a Natural Peach Seal, one didn’t need to dream about passing this tribulation.

Half a day passed, and Ling Jianxue finally descended from the sky. He was drenched in blood, and countless bones of his had also been broken. However, he had ultimately passed the heavenly tribulation.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. After reaching the Fifth Severance, his son’s future would be bright and limitless.

He tossed Ling Jianxue into the Black Tower to recuperate. Afterward, he started to head back to the Heavenly Saint Palace.

The flow of time inside the Black Tower was far too quick, so when Ling Han arrived back at the Heavenly Saint Palace, Ling Jianxue had already recovered to his most powerful state.

Ling Han spent some time condensing the celestial techniques that he had comprehended into a technique most suitable for his son.

There was no sun and moon in the Black Tower, and time flew past them at an incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of years had already passed. However, this was only one month in the outside world.

Ling Jianxue’s battle prowess truly reached the level of a monarch tier. Moreover, he could definitely rank in the top, even among monarch tiers. However, it was a shame that he was still unable to rival Ling Han. Compared to Hu Niu and the Empress at the same stage of their cultivation, he was still slightly inferior.

After all, Hu Niu had been the successor of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. Moreover, she also possessed the martial imprint of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Meanwhile, the Empress had shared some of Ling Han’s fortune, allowing her to obtain an unimaginable amount of natural treasures.

To say nothing else, both women had refined a Source Power of heaven and earth.

Even so, Ling Jianxue was still extremely satisfied.

Natural Peach Seals were far too rare. In fact, if he’d only relied on the Heavenly Saint Palace, he would have never been able to obtain one. Thus, he was already surprised and ecstatic that he could reach the Fifth Severance.

Right now, Ling Jianxue possessed the ability to become a Holy Son of the Heavenly Saint Palace.

Ling Jianxue ended his cultivation, but he didn’t immediately report his breakthrough to the Heavenly Saint Palace. Instead, he continued to temper his cultivation. In the near future, the sect would host a grand competition between core disciples, and he wanted to make a name for himself there.

In the beginning, Wenren Yue had still been extremely reserved. Recently, however, she became increasingly bold, not hiding her love for Ling Jianxue anymore. This gave Ling Jianxue a huge headache. If he rejected her, he would be hurting her too much. After all, they had gone through adversity together.

If he didn’t reject her, however, that would also be far too troublesome. More importantly, he was afraid that Chen Shuangshuang would misunderstand.

Even though he had indirectly told her that he loved someone else, Wenren Yue didn’t mind this at all. She had said that it was normal for a prodigy such as him to have several lovers.

Moreover, Ling Han was also adding fuel to the flames, continually creating opportunities for them to be together. As a result, the two of them almost never left each other.

Tap, tap, tap…

Chen Shuangshuang suddenly ran over.

“Uncle, the behavior of those two is truly outrageous!” she said with her hands on her hips. There was displeasure on her face, and she continued, “They’re not cultivating in earnest, and they’re always sticking to each other. What’s the meaning of this?”

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “Whom are you talking about?”

“Your son, of course!” Chen Shuangshuang said with a huff. “What’s with that woman? Does she not have her own abode? She doesn’t return even at night! Does she have no shame?”

“What’s wrong? Have they interfered with you?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Tsk, I’m only worried about Junior Brother Ling,” Chen Shuangshuang said with a humph.

Ling Han took a sip of tea before saying, “Jianxue is also at the age where he needs to get married. Since the two of them have a good relationship, we should let them become husband and wife.”

“We can’t do that!” Chen Shuangshuang immediately jumped up, and said, “Haven’t you seen Junior Brother Ling’s expression of unwillingness whenever he’s with that woman? Uncle, you can’t mismatch two people!”

Ling Han spread his hands, and asked, “Then what can I do?”

Chen Shuangshuang was simple-minded, so she couldn’t help but scratch her head in worry.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I have an idea.”

Chen Shuangshuang’s eyes lit up, and she asked, “What idea?”

“Why don’t you get married to Jianxue…” Seeing that Chen Shuangshuang was just about to jump up, Ling Han hurriedly waved his hands, and signaled for her to calm down, saying, “A fake marriage, of course, to shoo away all of those other lovers. That way, your Junior Brother Ling can also cultivate in peace.”
