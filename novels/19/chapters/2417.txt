Chapter 2418: Barging through

In one go, Ling Han walked 1500 meters ahead, as easily as if he were walking on flat land. His speed finally slowed when he reached this point.

The attacks that manifested again had become increasingly frightening, and could no longer be resolved with a single punch or kick.

Shen Hao shook his head internally. He, too, could barge to this point, but he would have long since consumed Crimson Demonic Earth. Otherwise, around 150 meters would be his limit.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?A few figures dashed over, and they all looked to be young men.

“Senior Brother Shen,” they first called out towards Shen Hao, and then turned to look at Ling Han, who was in the distance.

“Hehe, he’s close to his limit, right?”

“And here I thought he was all that strong. In the end, he’s just so-so.”

“For an outsider to manage to walk to this point is already very impressive.”

They talked among themselves, all revealing a strong feeling of superiority.

In their eyes, there was no way that Ling Han could advance further.

“Senior Brother Shen, why have you brought them here?” someone demanded of Shen Hao.

“That’s right.” The others all nodded. This was the private property of the line of Blue North. Though it was practically impossible for them to obtain a complete fruit, merely inhaling some fruity fragrance here could help them become Celestial Kings in a few billion years. This was an amazingly great opportunity.

Now that Shen Hao had brought four outsiders in, this would naturally affect their interests, which made them extremely displeased.

Shen Hao merely responded with a lazy smile, and ignored them.

Ahead of them, after Ling Han took another step, he saw a large rock glowing, which actually manifested into a golden rabbit.

Xiu,?the rabbit leaped, a pair of golden rays shooting from its eyes, blazing fiercely towards Ling Han.

Ling Han greeted the oncoming attack with a fist.?Hiss, when the golden light landed on his fists, it created a dazzling brilliance.

“How stupid can he be? To actually use his bare fists to withstand an attack of fierce light?” When the newcomers saw this, they all shook their heads repeatedly, expressing their extreme puzzlement.

1500 meters was a new threshold. After this line, the attacks here would become incredibly harsh, especially when it was this kind of golden light. It was filled with frightening destructive power, and could only be parried with Pseudo-Celestial Tools.

Ling Han actually used his bare fists to calsh with it; wasn’t that just committing suicide?

“How opinionated.”

“Haha, I’m just waiting to see his fists turn into ash.”

Those that had newly arrived were all jeering and mocking. In any case, this did not concern them. Furthermore, Ling Han was an outsider, so they naturally wanted nothing more than for Ling Han to be torn into bits.

Golden light filled the space, but the scene that everyone anticipated did not appear. Ling Han aggressively charged out, his fists unscathed and uninjured, a crystalline light flowing from them and blasting towards the golden rabbit.

Peng!

The golden rabbit was instantly sent flying, a hole actually appearing in its chest.

The new arrivals all felt their facial muscles twitch, lost for words.

Meanwhile, Shen Hao smiled faintly. Previously, he had almost been scared to death by Ling Han, and now that he saw the expressions of these junior brothers of his, he felt pleased for some reason.

“I bet that he will not be able to barge past 2250 meters,” one of them said through clenched teeth. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Obviously. Even Lord Master has said that from 2250 meters onwards, that would practically be Celestial King Tier attacks. What Ascending Origin Tier would be able to block that?” someone immediately followed.

“Aside from Celestial Kings, no one can barge past here, but when Celestial Kings arrive here, the Celestial Tree would immediately escape. Hence, this is a problem with no solution.”

The Empress finally couldn’t take it any longer. She glared menacingly at them. “Shut up!”

The few of them were immediately about to flip out, but when they saw the noble, elegant appearance of the Empress, their mouths merely opened, and they could not say a single word.

Ling Han sent out a series of over a dozen punches, and beat the golden rabbit till it burst with force.

His steps paused slightly. The Vitality Index of the golden rabbit had reached about 4500 points, and it should be known that the average peak stage of the consummate level Ascending Origin Tier would only be 4300 points. Only a Monarch Star would just barely reach 4500 points. Ling Han was a supreme monarch star, so he reached 4600.

In other words, this rabbit was so strong that even Ascending Origin Tier monarch stars would frown deeply.

This thought merely flashed through Ling Han’s mind and vanished. Ling Han continued onwards. Another insignificant-looking black rock glowed, and turned into a black wolf that released a howl at Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?With this howl from the black wolf, multiple black-colored blades of wind were released from its mouth, and sliced out towards Ling Han.

Instead of retreating, Ling Han forged onwards, sending out his fists in a fierce, extremely overbearing barrage.

Peng, peng, peng.?He aggressively charged until he reached the black wolf. He thrashed it now that he was close enough. In merely over a dozen punches, this black wolf was beaten until it burst, and turned back into a black rock.

Strangely enough, there was not the slightest bit of damage to the black rock.

Ling Han was curious, and picked up the black rock. After some thought, he turned back round and picked up that golden rock from before.

When the others saw this, they all felt an urge to clap a hand on their foreheads and howl to the heavens.

They had never seen someone like this who would pick up even rocks. This was no treasure at all, and could only show its might within the valley.

Yet Ling Han curiously played around with the two rocks, but no matter how much energy he pushed into them, these two rocks did not have the slightest reaction. It was like they were just ordinary rocks.

‘”Even if they cannot show their might, they would still be good for slamming on others,’ Ling Han thought, and stowed these two rocks away, growing keen as well. He wanted to retrieve even more rocks.

He forged onwards again, and more rocks manifested, launching attacks on Ling Han.

The further he advanced, the fiercer these attacks became. When he was almost close to reaching the 2250 meter-point, the Vitality Index of the rocks taken form had already soared directly to 4600 points.

In other words, even for supreme monarch stars, this would be their limit.

Ahead, there was still a distance of 750 meters to the end of the valley, and the Celestial Tree was upwards of that point.

Shen Hao shook his head. Even after consuming two mouthfuls of Crimson Demonic Earth in succession, this would be the limit. No one could consume three mouthfuls in succession. That would not have the slightest bit of boost to strength. The person would only die immediately.

The others were all filled with anticipation, hoping that Ling Han would advance further, and then get killed.

Ling Han paused slightly, and then raised a foot, which he quickly placed down.

Weng, a rock that was as high as nine meters suddenly came to life, turning into a rock golem that was similar in height.?Peng, peng, peng, stepping on the ground, it caused even the ground to tremble as it raced towards Ling Han. Frighteningly fierce might spread out. It was like a primordial beast that had come from the primitive age, capable of destroying anything and everything.

Finally, Ling Han did not dare to be careless any longer. He executed his strongest ability.

Body Art!

Peng!

He threw a punch, no longer holding back.

A terrifying scene appeared. This rock golem had been shattered with a single punch.

F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!

Shen Hao and the others were all frozen stiff, countless ****** darting through their minds. They could not understand at all. Previously, Ling Han’s battle prowess had clearly reached its limit, but why had he suddenly become so much stronger?

This was close to reaching Celestial King Tier battle prowess! This was practically a fatal shock!

“Could it be… that he has just consumed Crimson Demonic Earth?” one of them asked in a quavering voice.

“Impossible!”

The others all shook their heads. If Ling Han had not consumed Crimson Demonic Earth previously, how could he be so strong? In fact, he was even stronger than them when they had consumed the Crimson Demonic Earth.

“I have heard before that though the majority of outsiders are very ordinary, there are also some amazing prodigies,” one of them said slowly. “Just like how we are obviously stronger against others of the same cultivation level. This is named… king tier!”

“King tier?” The others heard this, and all appeared slightly proud. This was a good name, which they were very satisfied with.

“But above the king tier, there are another two levels,” the person from earlier continued.

“What!” The others were stunned at this. They actually were not prodigies of the very highest grade?
