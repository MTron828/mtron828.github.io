Chapter 2444: Trapped

Green flames rose, and Huo Furong’s aura also soared. Before long, her aura had surpassed the Celestial King Tier!

How was this possible? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Battle prowess was battle prowess, and this could indeed surpass cultivation levels. Right now, however, it wasn’t Huo Furong’s battle prowess that had surpassed the Celestial King Tier. Instead, it was her Vitality Index that had surpassed 5000.

One had to realize that regardless of whether it was the Heaven Forbidden State or the Crimson Demonic Earth, these things could only elevate one’s Vitality Index to a level infinitesimally close to that of Celestial Kings. Now, however, Huo Furong’s Vitality Index had definitely surpassed 5000. In other words, she was now a Celestial King!

Both Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong respected her, and she had even defeated Ji Wuming in his previous life. It was clear that she had astonishing talents.

However… this was far too astonishing.

“Huo Furong is regarded as the most powerful prodigy in all of history. If it weren’t for this flawless Celestial Seed, perhaps she would have already become a Heavenly Venerate,” Dongfang Rui said. He could barely contain his envy.

Xuan Rong also nodded, saying, “The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate has great hopes for her, and she hopes that she can become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.”

They had both been born far later than Huo Furong, so they had both heard about her legend. In fact, even the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had personally stated that their descendants were inferior to Huo Furong.

If anyone else had said this, they naturally would have been unhappy. However, the two Heavenly Venerates had personally said this, so they had no option but to accept this.

Huo Furong’s aptitude could be regarded as peerless in history. She could be viewed as the number one Celestial Maiden in the world.

“Little brat, when I was defeating opponents throughout the world, you were still nowhere to be seen!” Huo Furong said. She was like a queen of flames, with her entire body enveloped in scorching green fire. However, she remained indestructible. Meanwhile, the flames were so fiery that Ling Han felt a strong urge to avoid touching them.

This was far too terrifying.

“Source Power of Flames?” Ling Han guessed. This was because he had once possessed a Source Power of Flame as well. However, after advancing to the Immortal Palace Tier, he had severed the nine Source Powers. Right now, they were also about to become Celestial Kings.

However, Source Powers of heaven and earth were already at the Celestial King Tier to begin with, so the nine Source Powers didn’t need to traverse the Celestial Path. After reaching a suitable cultivation, they would naturally advance in tier.

“Indeed,” Huo Furong replied. She reached out her right hand, showing her snow-white and almost transparent skin. She was truly as delicate and exquisite as jade. A small rabbit materialized in her palm, so small that it appeared a little pitiful. It hopped around in her hand.

This rabbit was completely formed from flames, and it radiated with a sense of liveliness and might.

Her aptitude was peerless, and when she had traveled through the world, many Source Powers had actively recognized her as their master. Thus, she had easily reached the Dividing Nine Souls. Moreover, she was an individual of great ambition and willpower, so she had also given up these Source Powers when advancing to the Immortal Palace Tier.

Afterward, however, another Source Power that was nearing Great Accomplishment had actively recognized her master. This was the Boundless Green Phoenix Flame in her hand.

“Then come battle!” Ling Han said. He unleashed an attack at Huo Furong.

Huo Furong casually counterattacked. Her battle prowess was petrifying at this moment. With a single wave of her hand, it was as if she could obliterate heaven and earth. Her Vitality Index had soared to a whopping 5100.

Ling Han needed to exert great effort to keep up. However, he remained fearless. Huo Furong was indeed more powerful than him. However, his physique was also unbelievably powerful. Cancel out their advantages, and their battle prowess was actually similar. Neither side enjoyed an advantage over the other.

After 1000 exchanges, Huo Furong actively retreated from the battle. She waved her hand, and said, “You’re not bad.”

“You’re also very powerful,” Ling Han said with a nod.

“There are far too many limits rights now. Let’s battle again after advancing to the Celestial King Tier,” she said.

Ling Han agreed to her request. Before becoming a Celestial King, even though they had all kinds of techniques to possess a battle prowess at the Celestial King Tier, they were still subject to many prohibitive limits.

Ji Wuming was also burning with fighting spirit. Back then, he had been no match for Huo Furong. He had only just managed to endure 100 exchanges. However, he had already been Huo Furong’s most powerful opponent.

Moreover, he had gone on to become the most powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so this was proof enough of his talent.

However, Huo Furong was even more powerful than him. In fact, she had already possessed the aptitude to become a Heavenly Venerate back then. It was only because of her lofty ambition to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate that she had remained sealed for several epochs.

Just thinking about such an opponent made his body shake. It wasn’t out of fear, but excitement.

Ling Han and Ji Wuming were both the kind of people to become more excited the more powerful their opponent was. The emotions of exasperation and dispiritedness had absolutely nothing to do with them.

Huo Furong sat down, listening to the speculations the others had about the island. As she listened, her gaze slowly wandered to Little Terror. It was clear that she was itching to play with him. In fact, it was as if she could barely contain herself from snatching Little Terror over.

“If we work together, what’s the chance that we can break through the restriction of the water vines?” Jia Lan asked.

“100 percent!” Dongfang Rui said with confidence.

Ling Han frowned upon hearing this. In reality, they had very little understanding of the water vines. They didn’t even know how many existed. What if this was a large number? For example, 1000, 5000, or even 100,000?

They were unaware of their enemy’s situation, so how could they possibly estimate their chances?

Of course, the prodigies here were indeed very powerful. If they teamed up, they could most likely resist all of the remaining Ascending Origin Tier elites.

“Why don’t we give it a shot?” Shi Chanzi suggested.

Even though there was great internal conflict among their group, they all had a shared goal at this moment: to cross the sea. Thus, there was a good reason for them to work together.

“Then let’s go.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. They walked to the shore, and someone tossed out the corpse of an Immortal Beast to use as a ship. They all leaped on, after which they pushed with their palm to sail out to sea.

It wasn’t long before a sinister undercurrent caught up to them.

“Those water vines are trying to destroy our ‘ship’ again,” they all said.

“We’ll form groups of two and try our best to keep the water vines away. One group will stand guard, and the others will rest. We’ll rotate groups every one hour,” Huo Furong said, pulling her gaze away from Little Terror.

No one raised any objections. After all, there needed to be someone in charge. As the strongest person, and as someone who could suppress the descendants of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, Huo Furong was indeed the best choice. She didn’t have any direct conflicts with Ling Han, either.

The first group to stand watch was Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan. The two of them jumped into the sea, and it wasn’t long before everyone else detected the ripples of battle. However, they quickly received calls for reinforcement from the two cultivators.

“The water vines… number 300!”

Everyone was given a fright upon hearing this. The battle prowess of these water vines wasn’t overwhelming, and it was actually the pressure of the sea that was the most terrifying. Even with Ling Han’s freakish physique, he still couldn’t endure this pressure for too long.

Thus, battling in the sea put them at a huge disadvantage.

300 water vines… This was a petrifying number. Even Huo Furong couldn’t help but furrow her brows. Unless she advanced to the Celestial King Tier, there was simply no way she could battle against 300 water vines in the sea.

How were there so many?

“Damn it! More water vines are attacking!” They received even worse news.

They hurriedly paddled back, returning to the island. They looked toward the sea, only to see hundreds of water vines poking out from the surface. It was as if they had disturbed a dense nest of snakes. This was a harrowing scene.

“They’re genuinely trying to oppose us.”

“We can now confirm that these water vines are purposefully trying to trap us on this island. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have made it here.”

If these water vines had all rushed over to attack them before, they would have been left with only a single option—that was to advance to the Celestial King Tier.

“What are they planning to do?”

None of them could make head nor tail of the situation.
