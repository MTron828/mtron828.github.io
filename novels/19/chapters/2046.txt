Chapter 2047: Most Venerable Divine Path

This was just a single Source Power of heaven and earth.

Again!

Ling Han activated the Xuanyin Source Water, and a supreme aura suddenly flowed out of his body, instantly causing seven dragon bridges to light up at the same time and resonate.

“F*ck!”

“You must be kidding me!”

“This is absolutely not real!”

Previously, they had all thought that they would not drop their jaws again in shock. Heavens, what had they seen?

This man… had stimulated more than nine dragon bridges!

How was this possible? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Nine was the ultimate figure of the heaven and earth, and throughout history, no matter how stunningly prodigious you were, the highest accomplishment that could ever be attained would only be stimulating nine dragon bridges, which would ultimately turn into a single golden dragon bridge.

And as for Ling Han’s case?

16!

Inconceivable, this was practically a freak.

However, this was far from the end.?Weng, weng,?another two ordinary dragon bridges lit up, and the second golden dragon bridge was seen to light up.

Heavens! Gods!

A considerable number of people rubbed their eyes, but the scene in front of their eyes did not change in the slightest. It was still two golden dragon bridges that were flickering with light.

Previously, a similar scene had also happened before, and that was when Yu Huaqing and Zhu Huiyun stimulated the dragon bridges at the same time, which led to two golden dragon bridges shining brilliantly at the same time. But that had only been accomplished by two super monarch tiers working together.

And now, only one person had stimulated two golden dragon bridges, which had truly made history.

“Could it be that we are really going into a brilliantly prosperous age of cultivation?”

However, was this the end?

No way.

Ling Han then activated the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, and dragon bridges were lighting up rapidly again.

Uh!

Everyone’s mouth was wide open. This time, they could not make the slightest bit of sound anymore.

Could it be that Ling Han still wanted to stimulate a third golden dragon bridge?

Weng, weng, weng, weng.?Seven ordinary dragon bridges lit up quickly, resonating with Ling Han. Then, the eighth one also lit up, and then it was the ninth one.

The third golden dragon bridge had lit up, as if it was welcoming Ling Han with opened arms.

Three, three bridges!

There were gradually still people coming in, and they were immediately stunned into a daze the moment they entered.

This had to be an illusion, it had to be!

Ling Han smiled slightly, and activated the Firm Essence Green Gold.

Instantly, new ordinary dragon bridges lit up again, and then the fourth golden dragon bridge also lit up.

“Freak, I have seen a freak.”

“I must still be dreaming. Because the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm is about to open, I became too excited, and started dreaming.”

“Who exactly is this freak? He stimulated four golden dragon bridges all by himself.”

“That’s right. Who is he?”

Very quickly, everyone came back to the same question: who exactly was Ling Han?

What kind of force managed to nurture this kind of freak that would practically make even supreme monarch tiers blush with shame?

Ling Han was not in the mood to care about these people. His eyes were focused on that black dragon bridge.

He was going to stimulate this dragon bridge.

Since nine ordinary dragon bridges could stimulate a golden dragon bridge, then would nine golden dragon bridges be able to stimulate this black dragon bridge?

Ling Han thought that this was feasible.

Nine nines returned to one, and that was the Most Venerable Divine Path.

Thus, the present problem was whether he would be able to stimulate nine golden dragon bridges.

Again, again.

He activated the power of the Black Tower. It was inside his body in the first place, so it could also be considered a part of his body. This naturally was a cheat, but what Ling Han was betting on was the high grade of the Black Tower. It was a Heavenly Venerable Tier weapon, and in a certain aspect, it had even surpassed this heaven and earth.

It should allow him to cheat.

Weng, weng, weng.?Multiple dragon bridges lit up.

Ling Han was delighted. As expected!

Thus, another three golden dragon bridges practically lit up at the exact same time.

Everyone was speechless by now. They really did not know what words they could use to describe the feelings they were currently feeling.

…Previously, six great monarch tiers had only stimulated six golden dragon bridges, and this had already created history, but as for Ling Han? All by himself, he had stimulated seven golden dragon bridges. Didn’t that mean that he alone surpassed the six great monarch tiers?

If there was ultimately one person from the six great monarch tiers that could become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, then what kind of Celestial King would Ling Han become?

10th Heaven?

Sorry, there was no such thing as a 10th Heaven Celestial King in this world.

Everyone was shocked to the point of speechlessness, but Ling Han was not the slightest bit conceited, because the black dragon bridge had not lit up still.

Again!

He activated the three Regulations of Slaughter, Space, and Time, continuing to stimulate the dragon bridges.

Weng, weng, weng.

?Indeed, there was no conflict with the Black Tower, and again dragon bridges lit up.

The awesomeness of the Black Tower was evident from this.

When it expressed its might, the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm saw it and Ling Han as one and the same, but when Ling Han similarly showed three types of power of Regulation at the same time, the Black Tower could be clearly separated from Ling Han again. Otherwise, how could the power of Regulation that Ling Han had grasped compare to the Black Tower?

In comparison, it was natural that the stronger one would be taken, and Ling Han’s own power of Regulation was ignored.

But now, the dragon bridges were still continuing to light up, and the number was endlessly increasing.

Nine… 15.

This number had long since surpassed nine, but no new golden dragon bridge lit up.

Ling Han understood. This was because he had used three types of Regulations, and possibly was the equation of five plus five plus five, gathering nine which returned to one. Thus, not one golden dragon bridge had lit up still.

16, 17, 18!

When 18 ordinary dragon bridges lit up at the same time, all the dragon bridges shook, and then they all returned to dead silence.

Not just the ordinary dragon bridges had dimmed, but even those seven golden dragon bridges had lost their brilliance.

What was going on?

Everyone felt confused. What was the situation now?

Ling Han was also slightly surprised. Could it be that his cheating had been discovered, so all his previous results were now “confiscated”?

But right at this moment, nine golden dragon bridges lit up at the same time!

“Heavens, nine golden bridges lighting up at the same time, a magnificent feat that has no precedent!”

“Inconceivable, unbelievable!”

“This is going to be heaven-defying!”

“Could it be…”

Quite a number of people was suddenly stunned as they turned to look towards that black dragon bridge with wide eyes.

The Most Venerable Divine Path, a dragon bridge that had never been stimulated before.

Was it possible? Was it possible?

The nine golden dragon bridges flickered for a while, and then once again, they all dimmed.

Hong, long, long,?a large quake erupted in the entire Mystery Realm. Multiple images of Immortal Dragons appeared in the skies, chasing one another, and entwining around each other. Auspicious red clouds filled the skies, as if some extraordinary existence was about to be birthed.

“Images of auspiciousness appears from nowhere, this means, this means…”

“The truly shocking scene is about to appear!”

“Look!”

Boom, an indescribable aura surged out, causing everyone’s eyes to darken.?Pa, pa, pa, they all collapsed on the ground. At least 90 percent of them had passed out completely, and the remaining 10 percent found getting back to their feet extremely difficult, so they could only rest on their knees, feeling their legs tremble.

They felt like they were facing the world’s strongest dragon—indeed, the Ancestor Dragon, also known as the Source Dragon—which was the ultimate, strongest existence from the first batch of living beings that had been born when the world had first come into existence.

In front of this kind of being, they could only grovel. What right did they have to sit as an equal in its presence?

In front of the stunned, excited, expectant eyes of these people, the black dragon bridge lit up slowly, as if an ancient dragon had suddenly come back to life. A boundless aura rippled out, shaking the Nine Underworlds, and enshrouding the Nine Heavens.

The Most Venerable Divine Path…. had been stimulated!

Weng, an extremely imposing and overbearing aura surged over, and those that had previously fallen unconscious gradually regained consciousness.

They would never forget this scene today. A young man in black robes walked elegantly forwards, and stepped onto the black-colored dragon bridge, leaving behind the view of his back that they could only admire from afar.
