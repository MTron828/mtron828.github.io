Chapter 2115: Two Source Powers of Heaven and Earth

Ling Han glanced at the intense battle before resolutely leaving.

He couldn’t help Xiao Gu and the Eternal Celestial King at all. However, if he could find the Source Powers of heaven and earth and obtain or release them, he could achieve his goal of this trip.

As for the Black Dragon King… She was merely another elite.

Regardless of how powerful one was, if they weren’t a Heavenly Venerate, their influence on the world was only limited. This was the case even though she was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Meanwhile, the Black Dragon King more so wouldn’t pay any heed to Ling Han. Anyhow, Lu Hairong had already escaped, so she couldn’t be bothered paying any more attention to Ling Han. Instead, she would focus her full attention on suppressing Xiao Gu. The Eternal Celestial King was already an ancient and dead person, so there was no need to waste any time and effort on him.

Boom, boom, boom!

The shock waves of battle rippled outward. This was a fierce battle between Celestial Kings, and it was more so a clash between titans of the pinnacle level.

Ling Han silently navigated away, following the guidance of the Small Tower. However, this was no easy journey.

Small Tower’s guidance was extremely simple, consisting of nothing more than instructions to go up, down, left, or right. The problem was, however, that there might be obstacles such as mountains before him. How could Ling Han navigate through these obstacles?

Ordinary mountains and boulders were naturally no problem. However, where was this?

This was a continent where even the intense battle between Celestial Kings could only cause a limited amount of damage. As such, how could Ling Han possibly damage these mountains and forcefully traverse through them?

It would be futile even if he were 10,000 times more powerful.

Thus, he could only navigate around these mountains. Sometimes he would go too far, and sometimes he wouldn’t go far enough. In any case, he had to take detours here and there, and this gave him a slight headache.

He could only say that the terrain of this valley was far too complicated. In fact, he could even regard it as a formation.

This was actually extremely likely. After all, this valley was the body of a cauldron, one which was used to refine paramount treasures. As such, was it strange for a formation to exist inside this cauldron?

“Keep going forward, it’s just ahead, a little bit more… We’re there!” Small Tower exclaimed.

A corpse lay before Ling Han. This was a cultivator in purple robes, and there was still a fly-whisk in his hands. However, only the bottom half of the fly-whisk remained. There was a gaping hole in his chest, a hole that had directly penetrated his heart. Apart from this, there was no other wound on the corpse.

This had most likely been a fatal wound.

There was a symbol of flames on the cultivator’s forehead, and there was also a flower growing from his chest. This flower was as clear and transparent as jade. However, even though the flower was right before his eyes, upon closer inspection, it was as if it didn’t exist at all. It was as ethereal as could be.

“The Source Power of Flames?” Ling Han murmured in slight disappointment. He already possessed the Nine Heavens Flame, so it wouldn’t mean much even if he obtained another Source Power of the fire element.

His power would definitely grow, but not by a very significant amount.

From his observation, this cultivator had possessed a Source Power of Flames. He had also practiced the Regulations of Space. Thus, after dying, a Celestial medicine of the space element had bloomed from his body.

This was a Great Herb eight epochs old!

This was a fairly good result. He could give the Source Power of Flames to either the Empress or Hu Niu, while they could ingest the Great Herb together. Nothing would be wasted.

“That’s not the case,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han faltered for a moment before asking in delight, “Huh? Perhaps it’s a Source Power of Space?”

“Can you use your imagination a little?” Small Tower said with a sneer. “This cultivator is the well-renowned Purple Fire Celestial King. At that time, he enjoyed the fortune of the heavens, and obtained two Source Powers of heaven and earth.”

“So you’re saying… both the symbol of flames and the flower are Source Powers of heaven and earth?” Ling Han asked in surprise and delight.

It was indeed a pity that there was no Celestial medicine. However, obtaining two Source Powers of heaven and earth was naturally even more delightful.

“The flames are the Purple Spirit Flames, while the Source Power of Space is the Spiritual Void Glass,” Small Tower explained. “The Purple Spirit Flames are used to incinerate one’s divine sense, while the Spiritual Void Glass is used to create tens of thousands of clones of oneself.”

“Then let’s hurry up and obtain them!” Ling Han exclaimed in eager excitement.

“Same old rules. Channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Whether you can succeed or not, that’s all up to your luck!” Small Tower said.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. He sat down cross-legged.

Weng!

He started to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, upon which numerous golden symbols materialized on his body. Looking closely, there was even a hint of a nine-colored glow among this gold. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

One day, two days, three days…

Time slowly crept by. However, the two Source Powers of heaven and earth remained unmoving and unreactive.

Ling Han understood that Source Powers of heaven and earth couldn’t be aroused so easily. Right now, however, time was of the essence.

‘Hurry! I beg of you, hurry!’

Ling Han released his willpower, sending it to approach the dead cultivator.

This was an extremely risky move.

Even though the Celestial King was already dead, a starving camel was still larger than a horse. As long as their corpse remained intact, they would possess the destructive power to obliterate the world. Could they be approached by a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator?

However, Ling Han had no time, so he had no option but to take this risk.

“Senior, you passed away for the sake of resisting the invasion by the force of darkness. Now, the force of darkness has regathered their forces, launching another assault. They’ve got their eyes on your two Source Powers of heaven and earth. If they succeed, that’ll be a huge blow to our realm.

“So, this junior is going to act audaciously in violating your corpse. Please forgive me, Senior.”

His divine sense continued to advance, entering the most dangerous region. If he advanced any more, he might suffer the wrath of thunder.

Should he advance?

Of course he should! How could he retreat at such a critical moment?

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and advanced another step with his divine sense.

There was no reaction…

‘Great!’

Ling Han’s divine sense continued to advance, approaching the cultivator’s body. His divine sense then funneled into the corpse.

Weng!

He entered an all-new world.

After reaching the Celestial King Tier, a person would essentially become a world of their own. In fact, they could even nurture a small world in their bodies.

‘Where’s the Purple Spirit Flames? Where’s the Spiritual Void Glass?

‘It’s over there!’

Ling Han’s body was still outside, so he could clearly sense the location of the Purple Spirit Flames and the Spiritual Void Glass. Thus, he immediately corrected his direction and advanced toward some place.

He was going to look for the Spiritual Void Glass first.

Comparing the two, the Spiritual Void Glass was definitely more important.

Inside the body of a Celestial King, both time and space lost their meaning. Moreover, only Ling Han’s divine sense had entered, so this was much like when he cultivated under the Reincarnation Tree. An instant in the outside world would be tens of thousands of years in this inside world.

After heaven knew how long, a valley finally appeared before Ling Han. This valley was fully carved from crystal, and it was condensed into all kinds of shapes and sizes.

Ling Han walked inside, only to see a crystal hovering in the air above the center of the valley. It was shimmering with a brilliant radiance.

‘The Spiritual Void Glass!’

Ling Han walked toward it without any hesitation. His body was formed from his divine sense, so any physical contact would be contact with his divine sense.

Weng!

The Spiritual Void Glass immediately reacted to his approach, with columns of light soaring into the sky.

Strangely, however, he was unable to determine the colors of these columns of light. They were seemingly transparent, yet they were seemingly multicolored at the same time. They were indescribably strange.

‘Come, come, come.’

Time slowly crept by.

Four days, five days, six days…

Whoosh!

The Spiritual Void Glass suddenly shot into the sky.

‘What? it’s fleeing?’

Ling Han’s divine sense immediately left the cultivator’s body, only to see a streak of light shooting into the sky.

‘F*ck!’

Whoosh!

The streak of light drew an arc in the sky before surprisingly turning around and rapidly streaking back. It shot toward Ling Han.

Ling Han was delighted, and he immediately removed his defenses, allowing the streak of light to hit him.

The streak of light instantly fused into Ling Han’s forehead.

He had obtained the Spiritual Void Glass, his fifth Source Power of heaven and earth!

Ling Han laughed heartily. However, he had no time to celebrate, and he hurriedly made space in his Dantian for this new Source Power to occupy.

Next… it was time to obtain the Source Power of Flames!
