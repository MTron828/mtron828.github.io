Chapter 2638: A desperate battle

The Empress was battling Gu Heyi, but she wasn’t at any disadvantage at all.

Certainly, with the heavenly tribulation, which was the absolute main force of the offensive, added in, it caused the two prodigies to split and move in different directions, dodging constantly.

“Celestial maiden Luan Xing, why are you obsessed with that kid!” Gu Heyi said. Seeing that he could not win against the Empress, he changed his strategy, and attempted to break up the two. “He is not worthy of you at all!”

Her majesty didn’t say a word, but responded by slashing her dual swords at greater speed.

“I will love you a hundred times more than that brat! “Gu Heyi said.

“Disgusting!” the Empress reprimanded coldly.

Gu Heyi took a deep breath, and no longer had any delusions about the Empress. Even if he wanted to possess the Empress, he would directly suppress her with brute force and seize her body.

“You forced me to do this!” he muttered, and the Celestial Tool in his hand slashed forward with boundless radiance. “Ten Demon Soul Capturing Sword!”

He released a great attack with the sword blazing brilliantly, and slashing through the air—a soul-draining and fatal strike.

Weng, a spiritual attack was launched at the same time, charging towards the Empress.

The Empress was in great danger. It went without saying that a heavenly tribulation was a terrifying entity, and she was being attacked aggressively by a supreme monarch star who was at the peak of Seventh Heaven with a powerful attack at the same time, which naturally put a lot of pressure on her.

This was a disadvantage of several cultivation levels; it was just too wide a gap.

The Empress was fighting and retreating at the same time. Currently, the heavenly tribulation was wreaking havoc, and thus the blockade previously laid out by the six powerful elites was nothing more than an empty shell. In a sense, this had transcended Regulations.

Gu Heyi kept pressing on closely as he didn’t have much time left. If he couldn’t suppress the Empress soon enough, then when he dragged Ling Han out, the other party would have almost completely refined the celestial fruit.

He wanted to break through to the Eighth Heaven; he designedly had to do so as soon as possible, for only then would he be capable of contending with Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Gu Heyi’s attacks were getting more and more aggressive, but the Empress was defending just as tenaciously. Most importantly, he could only utilize part of his power for attacking, or the heavenly tribulation would unmistakably strike him, not bothering one bit if he was a Monarch Star or whatever else.

The Empress defended tenaciously. Soon, a day had passed, and the heavenly tribulation had dissipated.

The group of five including Fu Yunhai simultaneously attacked the Empress.

These were actually people with battle prowess at the Eighth Heaven. Even if the Empress had broken through to the Sixth Heaven, and was aided by two Celestial Tools, she was still not their match. She was immediately beaten to the point of vomiting blood.

The Empress couldn’t even hold her ground for 10 strikes. She had no choice but to retreat into the Celestial Guest Residence. Otherwise, she would be seeking death.

“Hmm?”

This was too obvious, so the six powerful elites were all eyeing the Celestial Guest Residence at the same time. It might be boosted with the Heaven Deceiving Technique, but that was useless at this point in time.

“Spatial God Tool?” Xue Chengbai said disdainfully, sending a punch towards it.

Weng, Divine Metal shone brightly, sending out a terrifying wave of power which rebounded back towards Xue Chengbai.

Xue Chengbai’s expression changed drastically, and he swiftly jumped out of the way to let the wave of power pass through.

Divine Metal would not launch an attack on its own accord, but when attacked, it could rebound the strike. This would be terrifying because once the attack was compounded with the destructive power of Divine Metal itself, it wasn’t something one could withstand unless one’s battle prowess was at the level of the Ninth Heaven.

“A Spatial God Tool made of Divine Metal!” Seeing this, the group of powerful elites exclaimed in surprise.

It was too extravagant indeed. Other people didn’t even have one Celestial Tool, whilst here they were, already forging a Spatial Celestial Tool with Divine Metal.

“So what!” Gu Heyi sneered. “This Celestial Tool was merely something they had forged themselves, and doesn’t even have the formation patterns laid out by a great Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier; it shouldn’t be difficult to crack.”

“That’s right!” Niu Cangyu and the others nodded in unison.

“Come, let’s join forces to crack it!”

The six powerful elites joined forces to strike again, but this time the attack was targeting neither Ling Han nor the Empress, but rather the Celestial Guest Residence.

They were all really greedy. This was actually an item made of Divine Metal. Even if they seized it, and did not choose to reforge it as a weapon, it was already very impressive solely based on the fact that it was a Spatial Celestial Tool—if there were exceptional formation patterns on it, then they wouldn’t need to fear even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

These were the formation patterns laid by Ling Han with his cultivation level of the Fifth Heaven; hence, they weren’t difficult to crack. After only half a day, the six powerful elites sneered.

‘Success!

‘Ling Han… die.’

From the moment they entered, they saw a blur in their vision as a human figure shot out towards them. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han!

The group of five including Niu Cangyu took a few steps back. They were too fearful of Ling Han; moreover, they were even more fearful that Ling Han had already refined the celestial fruit, and had brought his strength to a higher level.

“There’s no need to be afraid, it’s impossible for him to refine the celestial fruit in just a day and a half,” Gu Heyi said immediately, taking the lead in launching an attack.

Ling Han’s right hand waved, and the Divine Demon Sword was drawn.

Ding, ding, ding, the two prodigies were once again engaged in a fierce battle.

Indeed, it was as Gu Heyi had said: even if Ling Han had a physique of Time, a mere one and half day’s time was insufficient for him to refine the celestial fruit, raise his cultivation level to the peak stage of the Fifth Heaven, and break through to the Sixth Heaven.

However, Ling Han had no choice but to come out, as the formations of Celestial Guest Residence had been broken through, and soon the enemy would be closing in on them rapidly. At that time, he would not only be forced into a fierce battle, but also put all the women in danger.

Seeing that Ling Han’s strength hadn’t improved much, the group of five including Niu Cangyu breathed a sigh of relief, and then launched their attacks consecutively.

Ling Han kept fighting; even if he hadn’t broken through to the Sixth Heaven yet, his battle prowess was still higher than that of the Empress. Striking with fists and sword, he began to break free of their encirclement. The blockade surrounding them had already been destroyed by heavenly tribulation.

“Don’t even think about it!” The five including Niu Cangyu immediately leaped aside one after the other to set up a new confinement around them.

Ling Han smiled coldly. “If all of you insist on courting death, then I will fulfill your wish!”

“Your death is imminent.” Gu Heyi kept on badgering Ling Han, preventing him from having a chance to escape, while the other five including Niu Cangyu set up the restrictions. Thereafter, they joined forces with Gu Heyi to kill Ling Han.

“This brat has got such soaring levels of vitality, his body is a treasure in itself. Perhaps I can directly break through to the Ninth Heaven if I refine him!” Diao You said as his eyes swept over Ling Han’s body without any scruples.

What he meant was that he would refine Ling Han alive into an alchemical pill, which he would then ingest..

“That’s right, with such amazing Body Art, the physical body is indeed a treasured medicine!” Rong Wenlin nodded, licking his lips with his tongue. At their level, they only had eyes for striving towards the Ninth Heaven.

Under this premise, they could disregard all principles and human ethics.

“Kill!” The attacks of these Celestial Kings were even more violent. They knew that it was already impossible to get their hands on the Greenish Black Flowing Ripple Fruit, but if Ling Han was to be refined into medicine, the effect would be the same, or perhaps even better.

Kill, kill, kill! They fixed their eyes on Ling Han. If this went on, they would eventually kill him.

Yet Ling Han actually kept silent, which was uncharacteristic of him. He just continued to attack with his sword without saying a word.

“It’s just stubborn resistance.” Gu Heyi sneered. Although he had yet to see the dawn of victory and wouldn’t anytime soon, he believed that it wouldn’t take long for this day to come.

Whether it was 10 days, a month, or even half a year or a century, Gu Heyi would persevere until he killed Ling Han with his own hands.

Time was passing by quickly, and Ling Han’s situation was getting worse and worse. The combined power of the six powerful elites was really too terrifying. Furthermore, each one of them knew how to launch spiritual attacks, causing Ling Han to be riddled with injuries, and the Indestructible True Fluid was no longer sufficient to heal his wounds.

His injuries were so severe that his battle prowess had plummeted to rock bottom.

“Try a little harder, he won’t be able to hold on any longer! “Fu Yunhai exclaimed.

“Kill!” The six powerful elites all had bloodshot eyes.

At this moment, Ling Han’s body suddenly erupted with an incomparably powerful aura, as if a tsunami, which caused the six powerful elites to shudder uncontrollably.
