Chapter 234: Interrogation

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Yue Hong Chang?” Ao Yang Ming revealed a blank expression, shook his head, and said, “No.” Seeing Ling Han’s unfriendly expression, he immediately waved his hands and said, “I really haven’t heard.”

“Then don’t you have no use to me anymore?” Ling Han’s vicious aura spread.

Ao Yang Ming couldn’t help but feel gloomy. There were several tens of thousands of people from top to bottom in Winter Moon Sect, how could he possibly know every single person’s name? However, faced with Ling Han, a malignant god, he didn’t even dare to fart as he inwardly ridiculed.

Ling Han changed his mind and said, “What about Yue Zhen Shan?”

“Chief Yue?” Ao Yang Ming was stunned again. Yue Zhen Shan’s status in Winter Moon Sect could be considered second only to that of Ao Feng, because the Yue Family also had a reigning elder at the Spiritual Infant Tier whose strength was not below that of the Ao Family’s elder.

Ling Han was an unimportant person from Rain Country, so how was it possible that he knew about the Yue Family and knew that he was Ao Feng’s son? He seemed to understand the Winter Moon Sect thoroughly.

Seeing Ling Han glare at him, Ao Yang Ming hurriedly said, “Chief Yue is the same as father, at the peak stage of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. However, Chief Yue cannot be compared to father, because he only reached it two years ago.”

This guy seemed to be a little complacent.

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Are you really Ao Feng’s son? How come you’re such a trash?”

Ao Yang Ming was embarrassed and angry, but he had no strength to refute.

The Ao Family certainly had great authority within the Winter Moon Sect, controlling a surprising amount of resources, but the issue was that Ao Family was not just Ao Feng—there were many other clansmen and strong cultivators that depended on the Ao Family.

Besides, Ao Feng had too many illegitimate children. How could it be possible for every single one of them to receive enough cultivation resources? Some of his illegitimate children even ran to other sects, as they could receive more cultivation resources based on their identity there.

…An example would be if Ao Yang Ming came to Hu Yang Academy and showed clearly that he was a Winter Moon Sect disciple. Now, he wanted to enter your Hu Yang Academy, were you willing to accept or not? You definitely had to take him in, and you wouldn’t be able to ignore and throw him aside; you’d treat him like a baller. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, the majority of Ao Feng’s illegitimate children still wanted their face, and wouldn’t seek such gratuitous help, feeling it would diminish their status—Ao Yang Ming was a good example.

Therefore, he relied on his identity as the Winter Moon Sect’s direct disciple, but his cultivation was only at the fifth layer of the Element Gathering Tier, which was even lower than Qi Yong Ye and the others.

“Ling Han, I’ve already told you what you wanted to know, can you let me go now?” he said.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I saved your life, and you exchanged for it with the ancient record, which made us even. But, you shouldn’t have had evil ideas about me. The moment you took that step, you’ve pushed yourself into the abyss of death!”

“What, you’re going to kill me?!” Ao Yang Ming asked in disbelief. “You can’t conceal this! When the time comes, the Winter Moon Sect will crush you to pieces!”

Ling Han laughed aloud, and said, “Wrong, even if the Winter Moon Sect doesn’t come to find me, I’ll kill my way to their doorstep and settle something with them—especially your old man! Do you have any last words?”

Ao Yang Ming stared agape. Was this guy was crazy… he was only a mere small martial artist from Rain Country, but he said he was going to kill his way to the Winter Moon Sect to settle something. Did he not know that the Winter Moon Sect had many strong martial artists, including several hundred in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, dozens in the Flower Blossom Tier, and nearly ten in the Spiritual Infant Tier?

Such a force in the North Region would be in the top ranks, and a mere martial artist in the first layer of the Element Gathering Tier like you didn’t even care about them… what exactly was going on?

‘No, wait… This guy’s presence…!?’

Ao Yang Ming opened his eyes suddenly and said, “How’s it possible, you’re already in the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier?” At the Winter Moon Sect, he had contacted too many martial artists with their cultivation in the Gushing Spring Tier, so while he couldn’t sense the aura belonging to higher cultivation Tiers, it was still no problem for him if it was merely Gushing Spring Tier.

Several days ago, this guy was only at the first layer of the Element Gathering Tier, but he was now in the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier… what was going on?

Other people’s cultivation progress was from one to nine, then a large tier breakthrough. Could it be this guy only needed to take one step?

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Your last words are truly strange. Whatever, I don’t care. You can die now!”

“No, don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” Ao Yang Ming waved his hands hurriedly. “I can be of use to you!”

“So useless, what would I want you for?” Ling Han offhandedly sent out a palm. Hong , a flame swept by, instantly burning Ao Yang Ming to ashes.

Inside the Black Tower, he was a tyrant with abilities beyond that of Heaven Tier.

He looked outside through the Black Tower. Uncle Fu and the others already left, probably thinking that they escaped in some way, and were now searching for them like a headless fly. He called Liu Yu Tong and Hu Niu, and said, “Let’s go out.”

With a thought, he already brought the two girls outside.

Hu Niu already played like this a few times, so with her young age, she only thought it was fun; however, Liu Yu Tong turned pale from shock—this scene completely surpassed her understanding.

They appeared at the location where the tent used to be, but the tent was already gone. There was a hole in the ground—probably because uncle Fu thought they dug an underground tunnel to escape.

Could they dig an underground tunnel in such a short amount of time? It was obviously impossible.

As a Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivator, Uncle Fu did such a thing. He was obviously so panicked that he tried everything in this desperate situation.

“Ling Han, how come we’re here? And where were we just now?” Liu Yu Tong said, still somewhat shocked.

Ling Han laughed and said, “I obtained a treasure and we were inside it just now.”

Liu Yu Tong was even more shocked. The place they had been in was ridiculously large, so how could it be carried by him? Moreover, they clearly appeared at the same location, which meant that they were always here. It was such a large space, so how could Uncle Fu and the others miss it?

Ling Han didn’t explain further, because the Black Tower’s existence was a big secret. Those who did not gain his complete trust would never be able to enter the Black Tower—unless never to come out.

“Let’s go into the depths of the mystery realm,” he said in high spirits.

The Black Tower was equivalent to a complete safety guarantee, and Ling Han had great assurance in delving into the depths of the mystery realm to discover its secrets.

Liu Yu Tong and Hu Niu naturally didn’t oppose, so the three shuttled through the dense forest, venturing deeper.

One day later, they walked out of the dense forest, and saw in front of them a small mountain full of ups and downs.

“From here onwards, we’re entering the Devil Sky Mystery Realm’s danger zone. The beasts here are extremely terrifying, but spirit grasses here are more abundant,” Liu Yu Tong said. “Someone once ate a mysterious fruit here, and instantly rose from the Element Gathering Tier to the Spiritual Ocean Tier.”

This was certainly shocking, but mystery realms were associated with Shattering Void Tier, so it wasn’t strange that a spirit fruit like that actually existed.

“However, further down lies a large river that my family has strictly forbid everyone from crossing.” Liu Yu Tong paused, and then explained, “No one has ever returned alive from the other side of the river.”
