Chapter 2123: Why have you come?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Anyone would think that the person that had released this pained shout should be Ling Han, but the result had completely exceeded everyone’s expectations.

That third severance grand elder of the Kong Clan was clasping his right wrist, his expression filled with agony.

His blow had landed on Ling Han’s back, yet it was as if he had struck Divine Metal. Furthermore, because he had intended to kill, he was both harsh and heavy in his assault, which had directly broken his five fingers by the force of the rebound.

The nerves of the fingertips were linked with the heart, so it was naturally extremely painful.

“Ah!” That third severance grand elder was screaming incredibly miserably, tears practically streaming down his cheeks.

Ling Han turned his head slightly, and asked, “Are you all right?”

All right?

‘F*** all right, of course I am not all right!’

However, what that third severance grand elder felt even more was terror. The other man had not dodged or evaded, allowing the elder’s attack to land solidly, but the result was that it was instead the elder whose finger bones had been broken. Just what kind of astonishing strength was this?

“M-My Lord!” He forcibly suppressed the pain, and greeted Ling Han respectfully. “This junior is fine.”

“Then what were you screaming for?” Ling Han pretended to be surprised.

“This junior has lost his mind,” that third severance grand elder hurriedly declared.

Ling Han gave an oh. “Then you should get some treatment.” He extended a hand and pressed down.?Pa, that third severance grand elder was instantly rendered into seven or eight pieces, but Ling Han had not dealt a fatal blow. Thus, if that third severance grand elder was pieced together, he could still rebuild himself, and continue living.

But everyone, whether those outside or inside the town, was dumbfounded and gaping with shock.

That was too strong, wasn’t it?

Fourth severance grand elder?

At least that, and he might even be a king tier among fourth severance powerhouses at that. Otherwise, how could he possibly be so powerful?

In this instant, no one knew what kind of relation Ling Han had with the Liu Clan—whether they were enemies or friends. Thus, the Liu Clan’s side did not feel unburdened, while the Kong Clan’s side did not dare continue their assault, either. All of a sudden, a silence had fallen.

One person alone could decide the battle. This was the effect of an elite.

Ling Han was unconcerned. He continued to drag Seventh Brother as he walked forwards, and very quickly, he had arrived in front of the small town. The defense formation was just a short distance ahead.

On the city walls, an elder asked Ling Han, “Sir, are you friend or foe?”

This was a fourth severance grand elder, as well as the present clan leader of the Liu Clan, Liu Huashan.

Ling Han broke into a smile. “Now that you have a visitor, are you not going to invite me in?”

On the city walls, the members of the Liu Clan all began to shake their heads.

He got to be kidding. Presently, they were still protected by the formation, but once they deactivated it, they would be like an exquisite beauty lying naked in front of a pervert. It would be too dangerous.

Before finding out whether Ling Han was friend or foe, they would have to be extremely careful, and definitely could not afford to be careless.

Ling Han sighed. “The way you treat guests is really too horrible. I want to file a complaint.”

“Sir, if you can help our Liu Clan resolve the present predicament, you can ask for whatever you want!” Liu Huashan declared, appearing to be very generous.

There was no way he could not be generous. That was because under the powerful assault of the Kong Clan, they could not last for long, and once the city was breached, all members of the Liu Clan, young and old, would be killed. If they were dead, what would be the point of having wealth?

“Hehe, if Sir could penetrate the city defenses of the Liu Clan, then all the wealth of the Liu Clan can be handed over to Sir.” On the Kong Clan’s side, an elder also stepped out. Though he was extremely far away, his voice was still clearly transmitted.

This was the clan leader of the Kong Clan, Kong Zhangjin.

“Lord Clan Leader!” the members of the Kong Clan all exclaimed in shock.

What, to actually hand over all the wealth of the Liu Clan? Then wouldn’t the Kong Clan have gone to so much trouble for nothing?

Yet Kong Zhangjin waved a dismissive hand. These juniors really were short-sighted. The true wealth of the Liu Clan lay in their mines and herb gardens. Ling Han could not move these, and even if Kong Zhangjin had presently gotten the upper hand, they would still have to pay a very great price if they wanted to eliminate the Liu Clan.

Though his words were very generous, he was merely being generous with the wealth of others.

“Sir!” Liu Huashan called out loudly.

“Sir!” Kong Zhangjin also shouted loudly.

Now, Ling Han was a variable. His strength was unfathomable, so everyone wanted to snatch him to their side. Who knew, the scales of victory could tilt in favor of one side just because he leaned towards them.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If you are not willing to invite me in, I can only enter by myself.”

He raised a hand, and pressed down.

Weng, a wall of light immediately appeared out of thin air, seals of great dao flickering.

Ling Han stretched out a finger and flicked.?Weng, the wall of light trembled slightly like a ripple rising on the surface of water, crystalline waves rising up.

“What is he doing?” someone asked curiously.

“He can’t be planning to break through the formation by force, right?”

“That is practically a delusion.”

“This is the Dhara Subduing Formation, capable of stopping even Heaven Soul elites. If that hadn’t been the case, we would have long since broken through. We can only use our own formation to break through this formation, and use war machines to slowly wear away at the power of the members of Liu Clan so that the great formation would lose its source of power.”

“Though he is very strong, if he can really break through the formation, I will swallow this rock.”

The members of the Kong Clan whispered among themselves, and so did the members of the Liu Clan. However, they were even more confident, and thought that as long as there was someone maintaining the formation, then this great formation could never be penetrated.

“Sir, you don’t have to waste your time. There is no possible way you can penetrate the formation,” Liu Huashan stated calmly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and channeled the Regulation of Slaughter. He delivered a stroke of his finger.

Pa!

The shield of light trembled slightly, and immediately shattered like crystal, turning into countless pieces of crystal that reflected dazzling light.

Pu, everyone spluttered simultaneously.

The formation had really been broken through, and it had only been by a finger at that!

What kind of force was this? It was too terrifying and astonishing.

However, Ling Han did not take advantage of the opening and enter. Thus, the shield of light was reformed very soon, and enshrouded the town once more.

After all, Ling Han had not destroyed the formation, and merely broken through the formation shield by force. It was like how a person penetrated the defenses of his opponent in a battle between cultivators, but the question of whether he would inflict injury on his opponent would depend on whether he continued to follow up on his assault.

Ling Han channeled the Regulations of Lightning again, and a purple seal immediately appeared in the palm of his hand, flickering with electricity.

He stretched out his hand and pressed down lightly on the shield of light.?Zi, the lightning immediately shot out from the palm of his hand, instantly covering the entire shield of light.?Pa, the shield of light crumbled immediately, falling in pieces accompanied by the light of electricity.

The formation had again been broken.

Pu, everyone was once again gaping with open mouths and bulging eyes. He had broken through the formation again, and it was using another method at that.

Ling Han still did not take a step. Hence, the shield of light recovered once more.

In high spirits, he tried the Regulations of Space again. With a flash of his figure, he had directly appeared on the other side of the shield of light.

Everyone responded, “Er…”

Then, he used the Nine Heavens Flame, Xuanyin Source Water, Firm Essence Green Gold, and so on. In short, he had used every single one of the eight Source Powers of heaven and earth once, and he could easily break through that defense formation each and every time.

Everyone was already shocked to numbness. Their mouths twitched madly, yet they could not spit out a single word.

“This is not very fun.” Ling Han shook his head, and finally strode into the small town.

“Retreat, retreat!” Kong Zhangjin said in a quivering voice.

This man was terrifyingly powerful, and Kong Zhangjin had actually intended on bargaining with him. He had really been outrageously bold.

The members of the Kong Clan were already trembling in fear, scared witless. Now that they had gotten the command from their grand elder, they instantly turned around and fled in panic, fearing that Ling Han would suddenly change his mind, and say he wanted to pay a visit to the Kong Clan or something.

“M-My Lord!” The members of the Liu Clan could not flee. They could only get off from the city walls, and knelt down to make their salutations to Ling Han.

Liu Huashan was the clan leader, after all. Gathering his courage, he asked, “Dare I ask, My Lord, why you have come?”
