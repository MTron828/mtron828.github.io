Chapter 2038: Young Master has gone mad

Guo Ming and his wife kept declining. They really couldn’t bring themselves to take further gifts from Ling Han, but they could not hold up against Ling Han’s insistence, and could only accept those alchemical pills.

Ling Han also gave them some Reincarnation Tea, compensating Guo Ming and his wife as much as possible.

Even though he still did not know what use that ring had, merely the fact that it was forged from Divine Metal made it worth it.

On the sidelines, Fu Yue’s expression was filled with hurt.

He had also helped out, but why did it seem like he had been forgotten?

‘You guys are too mean!’

Guo Ming and his wife decided to leave United Link City after a few days. This time, the Seven Blooms Seven Poisons Palmstrike’s influence within Guo Ming’s body had also been dispelled, so they were sure that Ruan Dongxiang could not possibly catch up with them again.

“All right, we should leave too.” Ling Han stretched out languidly.

Fu Yue played around with the alchemical vial that Guo Ming and his wife returned to him. There were still nine Undying Pills inside here. He stowed the vial away, and said, “Let’s go to my place first.”

He had never been the type to avoid repaying his debts.

“What is it? You want to lay a trap for us, and capture us in a single scoop?” Ling Han asked with a grin.

“That’s right. You guys don’t dare to come?” Fu Yue challenged.

Pa, Hu Niu delivered a smack right onto the back of Fu Yue’s head, “Fu Yue, be polite when you speak.”

Fu Yue looked plaintively at her. ‘Is it very polite of you to hit me then?’

He did not dare to say these words to Hu Niu. He had already suffered enough in the hands of this little girl these two days. Furthermore, he had developed a clear understanding that no matter how beautiful a woman was, she possibly could still be incredibly violent.

Gentleness had never had any relation to appearance.

“All right, let’s collect our winnings,” Ling Han said with a grin. Initially, he had only been joking with Fu Yue, but since the latter was so determined to give him 100,000,000 Star Stoness, then there was no reason for him to refuse, either, right?

After all, the Divine Demon Sword was still quite far away from becoming a real Celestial Tool, and he was in dire need of a great amount of Star Stones.

The party returned.

On their way back, there was no need for Hu Niu to sniff around. Thus, their speed had increased considerably. After about more than a day, they had already returned to the main city center.

“Young Master!”

The moment they arrived, they saw a great many people gather around them, and the person in the lead was Fu Yue’s protector.

The old man glared, and demanded, “What have you done to Young Master in these several days?”

Otherwise, why else would they have disappeared quietly?

“Uncle Yu, where are the Star Stones?” Fu Yue asked.

“Oh, here.” Uncle Yu drew out a spatial ring.

Fu Yue strode over, and after taking it from him, strode back to Ling Han’s side, and tossed the ring over. “There is definitely no problem with my, Fu Yue’s, character as a gambler.”

Seeing this scene, everyone, including Uncle Yu, were dumbfounded.

‘F***, has your brain been kicked by a donkey?’

Just now, their young master could have clearly escaped from the hands of the devil, but now he actually took the initiative to take the ransom money, and hand it over to Ling Han. Was there something wrong with him?

Could it be that this was not Young Master?

Uncle Yu hurriedly swept his divine sense over him, but there was not the slightest issue.

This really was his young master.

“Young Master, could it be that your divided soul has been captured?” Uncle Yu asked. Otherwise, why would he act in this manner?

Even though the death of the divided soul would not cause any injury to the main body, the divided soul was still a portion of spirit that had been split out from the main body. Then, it definitely would still affect the main body, especially for those prodigies who were aiming for the high pinnacle of cultivation. This effect would be massive.

Fu Yue shook his head, and said, “Uncle Yu, there is no need to fret. These are my friends.”

Friends?

Were there such friends that would rob you of 100,000,000 Star Stones on the first meeting?

‘Oh no, Young Master has really become abnormal. Just what did he experience in the last few days?’

In front of the wide eyes of the masses, Fu Yue escorted Ling Han and his group into the Fu Manor, providing a cordial reception.

Because Fu Yue was the only descendant within three generations, the matter of his “kidnapping” had even alerted Old Master Fu. He had made an exception, and summoned Ling Han. And when Ling Han knew that this Old Master Fu, Fu Bo, was a Four-Star Alchemist, he gladly agreed.

“Greetings, Senior Fu!” When he was led by Fu Yue into the main hall, Ling Han greeted the elder that was seated at the seat of the host respectfully.

Fu Bo, the actual ruler of United Link City and the chief alchemist under the Moon Plucking Celestial King. Not only was he a Four-Star Alchemist, he had also advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier in terms of cultivation. Though alchemists were very weak in a battle of equal cultivation levels, Ascending Origin Tier was still Ascending Origin Tier, after all. Wanting to suppress any Immortal Palace Tier would only be a piece of cake.

“Dispense with the courtesies.” The old man raised his hand. His hair was completely white, and even his brows and beard were white, but the rosiness and smoothness of his complexion was like a baby’s. He stared at Ling Han for a while, and then only did he say, “I heard that you kidnapped my grandson?”

A show of strength right from the start then.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Senior has misunderstood.”

“Oh, since it is a misunderstanding, why did you accept 100,000,000 Star Stones from our Fu Clan?” the old man asked calmly.

It looked like the old man wanted to take this 100,000,000 Star Stones back.

Ling Han naturally would not agree. How could he possibly hand out something that had already entered his pockets?

He immediately changed the topic, and said, “I have a question on alchemy that I would like to ask Senior.”

“Yi?” Fu Bo immediately showed an expression of surprise. He knew that Ling Han was a cultivation prodigy, and could suppress his grandson even when he himself was only a Yang Soul, and only a Celestial King Tier-level great sect would be able to nurture monarch tiers.

This was also why he had only pressured Ling Han, and had not made it physical—whatever that had been swindled had to be returned, but at the same time, he could not offend him too far, either.

Yet Ling Han actually wanted to ask him a question on alchemy… ‘What f****** business is that of yours?’ DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yet Ling Han simply continued to speak without concern. After leaving the Eastern Celestial Realm, he had never neglected his studies of alchemy even throughout these many years, and he had indeed accumulated a great many questions and doubts.

At first, Fu Bo was unconcerned, but his expression became solemn very soon, and then he even showed an expression of excitement.

Prodigy, this was an alchemy prodigy!

Fu Bo had not taken any disciples, but had rather passed on all the comprehension of alchemy he had accumulated throughout his lifetime to his son, yet his son did not have natural talent in alchemist, and just barely managed to become a One-Star Alchemist. Meanwhile, his grandson only had very high natural talent in cultivation, and could not inherit his legacy, either.

This was a regret that he had always had, worrying that his knowledge of alchemy would thus die out.

And now that he had suddenly seen an extraordinary genius of alchemy, his heart instantly soared. He couldn’t help but want to take him as a disciple so he could pass on his knowledge.

The moment this intention to treasure talent arose, whatever Ling Han asked, he would explain with great care, only fearing that this prodigy would take a misstep and be misled onto the wrong path. That would be a loss to the entire field of alchemy, and would cause him to grieve and lament.

The elder and youth continued to discuss alchemy endlessly, causing Fu Yue to feel both stunned and bored.

He had initially thought that Ling Han was only doing it for show for the benefit of the old man—to gain the old man’s favor. He had never thought that Ling Han was really capable of alchemy, and it seemed like his accomplishments in the field were not too low, either. Otherwise, how could it possibly make the old man so serious?

But Ling Han is clearly a monarch tier of cultivation—was there really anyone so freakish in this world that could be prodigiously talented in two completely different fields?

And what was boring was the fact that he really did not have the slightest interest in alchemy. As he listened to the two of them talk, it was like a fantasy story, making him feel so bored that he kept yawning. Furthermore, without getting the approval of his grandfather, how could he possibly dare to leave without permission?

Thus, he could only suffer on the sidelines as he accompanied them, feeling discomfort that was indescribable fill his entire body.

Finally, a whole 10 days later, the two of them finally stopped.

“Er, I still have a question—”

“Let’s leave it for later, leave it for later!” Fu Yue hurriedly pulled Ling Han up, and ran off without looking back. Previously, Ling Han had also said that he had a question, and Fu Yue was already forced to sit there for 10 whole days. If there was another question that Ling Han was asking, would Fu Yue even live through it?
