Chapter 1876: Pill concoction again

Ximen Da felt very depressed.

By nature, he was wanton and unrestrained, and today, on a whim, he had brought two of his paramours to this wild mountainous area. With the skies as their blanket and the earth as their bed, he planned to have a completely unreserved party of three.

In the end, they had yet to begin when tribulation clouds had come all of a sudden.

Someone was enduring a heavenly tribulation!

Ordinarily speaking, the heavens had good eyes, and as long as you did not actively interfere, the divine lightning would not strike you even if you were close at hand. But after the divine lightning descended, what would happen to the shock waves that were created in the process was not within the heavens’ range of consideration.

Thus, when someone was experiencing the heavenly tribulation, it was still best to avoid them as much as possible.

Unless it was a Severing Mundane Tier enduring the heavenly tribulation, and you yourself were a Dividing Soul Tier, then you couldn’t just boldly stand within the scope of the heavenly tribulation. The aftermath that was generated could not possibly cause much damage to you only then.

The problem here was that both Ling Han and the Empress were existences that were close to the monarch tier, and they were experiencing the heavenly tribulation for fourth severance, which was astonishingly terrifying.

Ximen Da naturally could only hurriedly pull his two female companions along and flee in a panic.

“F***, are you people doing it on purpose!?” When he had reached a safe area, Ximen Da couldn’t help but point at the skies and curse. ‘Wasn’t I just indulging myself in a bout of public s**? Do you guys have to cause trouble to me like this?’

However, when his eyes glimpsed the Empress, a stunned expression instantly appeared on his face.

F***, how could there be such a beautiful woman!

“Young Master!” The two beautiful women both played coy, patting their bountiful breasts, and looking as if they had not regained their wits from the terrible scare, and needed him to soothe their fears.

If this had been any other time, Ximen Da would definitely have gone nearer with a perverted expression, but at present, he did not have the slightest bit of interest. He carelessly pushed the two women to one side, his eyes fixed on the Empress while shining with a light that made him look like a hungry wolf.

“Yi, this guy!” Finally, he had spotted Ling Han, and couldn’t help but experience a shock. “It’s the guy that defeated Zhao Qingfeng!”

Immediately, he felt a cold chill rise up from the soles of his feet, and in an instant, all his lecherous intent was erased without a trace.

The Ximen Clan was very strong, and had an Immortal Palace Tier Ancestor keeping watch. In alchemy, they could also be considered a respected clan, but it was only that. They had not reached the extent of having a critical role.

However, it was rumored that a considerable number of powerful figures had already expressed interest in Ling Han, wanting to take him as disciple, son-in-law, or something of the like. In short, Ling Han was very popular now, overwhelmingly and outrageously popular.

To offend Ling Han at this point in time was really a very unwise action.

Ximen Da might be a pervert, but he was no idiot.

‘Our Ximen Clan, too, wants to recruit this man, but has completely no way to contest with those mighty figures,’ Ximen Da thought. ‘However, he could be considered as having incurred a debt to me with this, so I could use this opportunity to befriend him.’

You should not covet the wives of your friends. Ximen Da was well aware of this principle. Though he was lecherous, even robbers had their principles. He was definitely not going to steal his friend’s wife, and all his friends were well aware of that.

He would just sit by and watch as Ling Han and the Empress endured the heavenly tribulation, and when they were done, he would immediately approach and worm his way into befriending them.

But as he watched, his expression slowly changed.

This was the f****** heavenly tribulation for fourth severance?

Did they think he had never endured the fourth severance? When he endured the heavenly tribulation for the fourth severance, it did not even have a 100th of the power behind this... No, no, no. It was not only a 100th, it did not even have a 10,000th of the might of this heavenly tribulation.

As expected of the man that had defeated Zhao Qingfeng!

Hold on, Ling Han being so strong was one thing, but why was the heavenly tribulation for this beauty also so terrifying?

Realization suddenly dawned on him. The heavenly tribulation was actually the best reflection of one’s strength. The stronger the heavenly tribulation, the higher one’s strength was. That was why the heavens would increase the might of the heavenly tribulation to temper them as appropriate.

Monsters, two monsters!

This kind of woman was absolutely no one that he could covet.

Ximen Da immediately made up his mind, and did not dare to have any further ideas about the Empress.

Half a day later, the heavenly tribulation had passed, the tribulation clouds dispersed, and both Ling Han and the Empress descended onto the ground, exchanging a smile with each other.

Ling Han had greater gains. He had tempered his physique again, and truly reached the height of Three-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. By now, while his battle prowess had still not reached the level of Yang Soul Tier, it was already very, very difficult for Yang Soul Tiers to kill him.

Even if they were to refine him through Regulations, that would need years to accomplish.

If he faced Zhao Qingfeng now... A confident smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. Within 100 moves, he would definitely be able to kill him!

Not defeat, but rather kill.

Ling Han looked towards Ximen Da, smiled, and said, “Friend, apologies. I thought there was no one here.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. In any case, I was not injured, either.” Ximen Da grinned brightly. “I’ve yet to congratulate Young Master Ling for advancing to the fourth severance. Becoming a Dividing Soul Tier will be just around the corner.”

Ling Han was slightly surprised, and asked, “You know me?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“By now, who would not know of Young Master Ling in Alchemy City?” Ximen Da asked. This naturally was an exaggeration, but flattery was always pleasant, so these words of flattery still made Ling Han considerably pleased.

At least, the Empress was very pleased. No matter how others flattered her, respected her, or feared her, she would take it all as a matter of course, but if it was flattering Ling Han, she would be elated.

Ling Han chuckled. He naturally would not become smug and conceited, and treat this person as a close friend just because of a few flattering words.

“Young Master Ling, why don’t you come and visit my humble abode so I could host a celebratory feast in your honor?” Ximen Da took the chance to offer an invitation.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “No need. I have other business.” He paused, and thinking that he had indeed almost caused the heavenly tribulation to implicate these three people, he said, “I am presently staying at Lu Xianming’s place. If you are free, you can come and pay a visit.”

“Good! Good! Good!” Ximen Da was just feeling a little disappointed, but when he heard the last few words, he was naturally overjoyed, and nodded hurriedly.

Ling Han directed a smile at the other, and holding the Empress’s slender hand, he returned to Lu Xianming’s place.

When Lu Xianming knew that Ling Han had come out of seclusion, he couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised. He had thought he would have to wait over 10,000 years at first, and when he discovered that Ling Han had actually successfully broken through to the fourth severance, he was incredibly astounded.

It had just been two months, and Ling Han had actually broken through!

He really was a freak!

Lu Xianming could not help but feel impressed. It was no wonder that Ling Han could defeat Zhao Qingfeng. His talent in martial arts was really awesome to the extreme. Thankfully, he himself was an alchemist, and no matter how outstanding Ling Han was, he could not possibly threaten his position.

Lu Xianming wanted to celebrate Ling Han’s feat, but was met with Ling Han’s tactful refusal. The latter went out to look for a Time Cultivation Chamber. He wanted to become a Celestial level alchemist in the shortest period of time possible.

Initially, there were a great many higher-ups that wanted to recruit him, but he had just come out of seclusion, and then entered into seclusion again. It could not be helped. These people could only wait, which also caused some powerful figures to become angered. ‘You are but a mere Severing Mundane Tier, so don’t you think you are being too arrogant?’

But when they found out that Ling Han had broken through to the fourth severance, the anger of these mighty figures all disappeared without a trace.

Prodigy! He was really too genius!

Immediately, they made adjustments to their previous plans, and brought out more sincere conditions to recruit Ling Han.

For the moment, Ling Han did not know of these matters. He was inside the Time Cultivation Chamber, tirelessly working on pill concoction.

On the fourth level, the acceleration effects had improved from 20 times to 30 times, but the price was also enough to strike one dumbfounded. The acceleration of 30 times shockingly needed 30,000 Star Stones for a single day! And this was also why people from the first level could come here, but there would not be many at all who could take out enough Star Stones to stay here for a day.

Ling Han swept an “eye” over the Black Tower, and paid for 10 days.

10 days, after acceleration, would mean 300 days, which was enough for him to concoct his first cauldron of Celestial pills.

He began to concoct pills, and failed a few times consecutively. When it had reached the fifth day in the outside world, which was also over 150 days later in the cultivation chamber, he finally entered into a prime condition. The success of his first cauldron of Celestial pills was close at hand.

“Ah!” He suddenly humphed lowly, a strong shiver overcoming his whole body. All of a sudden, he collapsed onto the ground. Peng, the cauldron went out of control, and exploded immediately.
