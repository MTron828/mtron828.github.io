Chapter 3424: Smashed to death

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What was going on here? A young man was walking over with six fair and delicate children?

This wasn’t a street, but an ancient site.

The members of the Jin Clan and Lu Clan all wore strange expressions as they looked at Ling Han.

“Ling Han?” However, after a moment of shock, these people all recognized Ling Han.

Previously, Ling Han’s name was known throughout the Imperial Capital. Whether it was his furious rebuke of Grand Tutor Hong, or his romantic affairs with Princess Bixiao, they had all caused his reputation to rise greatly. The hidden clans were only keeping a low profile. It was not like they would just ignore the outside world.

“Very well, you actually dare to follow me!” A baleful expression immediately appeared on Lu Gao’s face, and he strode towards Ling Han, “I have already said. If I see you again, you will only have two choices. Either become my subordinate, or die!”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “I discovered that hidden clans like yours all have a common trait, and that is you all have thick skin, and have a very good opinion of yourself.”

“Impudence!” the members of the Jin Clan and the Lu Clan shouted in unison. They were the hidden clans of the Celestial Sea Planet, the heirs of the civilization of the last era, and the most orthodox heirs of Celestial Sea Planet. A country bumpkin like you actually dared to be insolent in front of them? “Looking at how stubborn you are, it is clear that you do not want to join me.” Lu Gao charged over, and delivered a palm strike to the top of Ling Han’s head. He was determined to kill him.

Ling Han humphed, and with a wave of his right hand, he had already thrown out the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

On his way here, he had been exerting his Spiritual Power on the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and had already lowered the weight of the Heavenly Pattern Jadee to around 1.5kg. With this toss, it instantly burst out at six times the speed of sound, and was still accelerating.

Seven times, eight times, nine times!

At nine times the speed of sound, it shot towards Lu Gao.

This speed was practically like a streak of light. With Lu Gao’s current strength, he could still block it if it was just six times the speed of sound, but nine times ’ the speed of sound was something that was very difficult for his eyes to capture.

However, prodigies were still prodigies, after all. He still managed to forcefully raise his right hand as a block block in front of him.

Pa, blood gushed out.

If time could be slowed down by 10,000 times, one would be able to clearly see Lu Gao’s arm that was blocking in front of him explode. The Heavenly Pattern Jade was unstoppable, and did not slow down in the slightest. It crashed into Lu Gao’s chest again, and then Lu Gao’s entire upper body exploded.

This was a “bullet” that weighed 5,000kg, so there was no need to sharpen the head at all. In fact, the blunt side could increase the destructive power, forming a terrifying tearing effect, causing Lu Gao’s upper body to be torn apart instead of having a hole in his chest.

Pa, pa, pa! The lower half of Lu Gao’s body was still running, while still spurting out blood. The sight was terrifying.

At this moment, a dead silence fell.

What was going on?

Although Lu Gao couldn’t be regarded as a supreme elite, his battle prowess was already at the pinnacle of the Inscription Tier. Yet, he had been insta-killed by Ling Han with a single wave of his hand. Moreover, he had died in such a miserable manner. How could they accept this?

Could it be… that Ling Han’s strength had already advanced into the Enlightenment Tier?

“Gao’er!” The Enlightenment Tier elite from the Lu Clan was filled with grief. This was a prodigy from the Lu Clan! Although his cultivation level couldn’t compare to Jin Shaohuang for the time being, the only difference was in cultivation level and not talent.

But now? He had been insta-killed!

“Little brat, you’re seeking death!” He was seething with rage, and a vein was popping on his forehead.

Ling Han’s expression was cold, “Towards those who want to kill me, I have never been merciful.”

As he spoke, it was as if the Heavenly Pattern Jade had grown wings, and flew back towards him out of thin air.

This caused everyone to stare blankly. It should be known that even if someone had cultivated Spiritual Power, which allowed him to draw objects from a distance, he could not possibly reach for such a far distance.

They naturally didn’t know that this was Sixth Baby carrying the Heavenly

Pattern Jade back. It was just that no one could see Sixth Baby.

Ling Han reached over and retrieved the Heavenly Pattern Jade. At the same time, he injected more Spiritual Power into it, making it lighter.

He had not expected that the might of this blow would actually be so terrifying. Previously, he had also used Spiritual Power to control the flying sword, which was also a deadly weapon. However, compared with the destructive power of the Heavenly Pattern Jade, the gap was quite large.

But upon further thought, the Heavenly Pattern Jade was a Two Star material, above the Celestial Path.

How could the materials used by Celestials be comparable to a flying sword forged from ordinary refined metal?

Just think about it. Smashing out something that weighed 5,000kg at nine times the speed of sound, and it was only the size of a fist at that, just how terrifying would the destructive power be?

No wonder the civilization of the last era had not developed technology. F***, what kind of gun or cannon could compare to this kind of weapon?

Moreover, Ling Han was only at the Extreme Bone Tier right now, and he was still extremely far from the Celestial Path. Meanwhile, Heavenly Pattern Jade was only Two Stars. If a supreme elite truly attacked, wouldn’t they be able to obliterate a planet with a wave of their hand?

The four Enlightenment Tier elites all looked at Ling Han with lingering fear. If this attack landed on them, would they be able to withstand it or dodge it? The four of them had no confidence at all. If they really waited for the attack to come out before dodging, then as long as the distance was not too far, they would not be able to dodge at all an attact at nine times the speed of sound, and if they took it head-on, they would probably be blasted into smithereens.

To dodge, they could only keep an eye on Ling Han’s hand and determine the direction of the attack the moment he raised it. From there, they would be able to dodge in advance.

“Heavenly Pattern Jade!” the Enlightenment Tier from the Lu Clan said through gritted teeth. He was from a hidden clan, so he naturally recognized this kind of treasure.

“So, you’re Shaojian’s murderer,” Jin Shaohuang suddenly said. When Ling Han was close enough, the Hook Insect suddenly reacted, letting him know that the person standing in front of him was Jin Shaojian’s murderer.

‘Eh?’

Ling Han was astonished. Was he trying to trick him? However, judging by his expression, it was clear that he was extremely certain.

Either the other party’s acting skills were too good, or the other party had some kind of treasure on him that could find clues from the corpse and point him straight at the murderer.

Interesting.

He smiled faintly, “I have already said. Whoever wants to kill me, I will kill them.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If I want to kill you now, could it be that you would be able to kill me?” Jin Shaohuang walked toward Ling Han. Light surged around him, and there was an indescribable aura and majesty about him.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back, and said, “You can give it a try.” Jin Shaohuang didn’t dash forward. He was afraid of the Heavenly Pattern Jade in Ling Han’s hand. This attack was far too quick, so he definitely couldn’t move first. Otherwise, even if he managed to grasp the trajectory of Ling Han’s attack, he wouldn’t be able to change his course in time.

“Within ten moves, I will take your life. Do you believe me?” Ling Han asked calmly.

Jin Shaohuang couldn’t help but chuckle upon hearing this.

This was the biggest joke in the world!

He stared at Ling Han, and there was a strange light flickering in his eyes. Then, he said, “Your cultivation level is only First Extreme, and there is a gap of more than two major cultivation levels between you and I. To say nothing of not being able to withstand a single blow from me, you actually want to kill me within ten moves?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Come, I will teach you how to behave.”

Ignorant fool!” Jin Shaohuang was only nine meters away from Ling Han. He humphed and struck out with his right hand, pressing down on Ling Han. This was the attack of an Enlightenment Tier elite. Boom, he sent out a palm strike, which instantly formed multiple mountains that pressed down on Line Han.???? 5
