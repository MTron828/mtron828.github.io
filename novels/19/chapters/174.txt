Chapter 175: Ling Han’s Rage

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

A frosty aura emanated from Ling Han as he stepped forwards to parry the attacks of these four men.

Was he seeking death?

The combined attacks of four elites of Gushing Spring Tier caused someone who was merely in Element Gathering Tier to actually neither dodge or avoid, but step forwards to receive their attacks head-on. Where did he get such courage from?

Peng, peng, peng, peng . A series of blasts were heard and instantly, the expressions of the observers became utterly astonished!

They could only watch as four figures were flung outwards from a heavy impact, and who could these four figures be but the four Guardian Deities of Feng Yan?

Ling Han did not even pause, and had already arrived at a spot right above Feng Luo’s head. Pa , and his foot was firmly stomped onto Feng Luo’s head.

Tong !

A muffled sound was heard and Feng Luo’s entire head was firmly pressed into the ground. He was forced to kneel on the ground while his arms were helplessly hanging by his sides and his bottom was raised high, as if it was a chrysanthemum flower about to blossom.

“Wa!” Ling Han’s figure dropped down onto the ground, and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

That was not because he had been injured by the four Guardian Deities. In fact, it was because he had injured himself when he had stepped out earlier on in order to stimulate the Lone Wolf’s Blood. He had not had the chance to spit it out earlier on.

Dead silence filled the air.

A martial artist in Element Gathering Tier actually defeated four elites of Gushing Spring Tier—who could actually believe such a feat was possible? Who could accept such a reality? Though Ling Han had indeed suffered some injury and spat out blood, this could not in any way conceal his radiance.

That was too awesome, wasn’t it?

Ling Han finally smiled calmly, and said, “Now that there is no longer a fly noisily buzzing around, the world has indeed become much more peaceful and quieter.”

“Li Hao!” Zhu Xue Yi had covered her face earlier, as she could not bear to watch as Li Hao was crippled at Feng Luo’s hands. But when she heard the astonished gasps of those around her, she opened her eyes and saw that not only was Li Hao not injured, even Feng Luo was subdued. She could not help but be overjoyed at the turn of events, and rushed over to him.

Ling Han helped Li Hao up, and said, “I’ve involved you in this matter.”

“Aren’t we friends?” Li Hao asked.

“Haha, friends, that’s right, we’re friends!” Ling Hao clapped a hand on Li Hao’s shoulder. In the past, he had only felt that he wanted to give a hand to Li Hao on his way to great accomplishment, but after the matter today, he had finally accepted Li Hao as a true friend.

For his friends, Ling Hao could become completely crazy.

“Xue Yi, take care of Li Hao. I still have some debts to settle with somebody!” Ling Han said darkly. Li Hao had been horribly beaten up, and would at least need about a month to rest and recover from his injuries.

“Ling Han, do you know what you are doing?” the four Guardian Deities all came towards him, speaking loudly, a powerful, threatening air emanating from all of them.

They were only flung out of the battle by the impact, but had not suffered any injuries.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and said calmly, “You all should feel that you are very lucky that this is the Academy. That’s why I will only cripple you, but will still leave you with your lives!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Insolence!” the four Guardian Deities all shouted in unison.

This brat was really too outrageously bold. One had to know that although they were flung out of battle with a single move, that was also because they had been too careless, and had underestimated Ling Han’s ability. One only had to look at how they were completely unharmed, and would be able to know that they were indeed very powerful martial artists.

“Let go of Young Master Luo!” one of the Guardian Deities said. These four Guardian Deities had been named respectively as Tiger, Elephant, Panther, and Wolf, and the person who had spoken was the Elephant Guardian Deity.

“Oh, now that you mention it… I almost forgot.” Ling Han smiled. He used a foot to kick at Feng Luo’s bottom and said, “This is the master of you four dogs! Come, kneel down and greet your master!”

“What!” the four Guardian Deities glared furiously. He actually wanted them to kneel.

“What is it? Can’t you even kneel down for the sake of your master?” Ling Han said calmly as he drew out his sword. “Then who knows, if I’m not happy, maybe I would slice off one of his arms in my displeasure.”

The four Guardian Deities were all shocked. They had naturally not placed any importance on Feng Luo, but Feng Luo was still Feng Yan’s brother. They had already received Feng Yan’s command to protect and guard Feng Luo. If Feng Luo was crippled right in front of their eyes, how could they be able to face Feng Yan again?

“Teacher Yang, this brat intends to commit violence in public. I would like to request Teacher Yang to step forwards to stop him!” the Wolf Guardian Deity said to the teacher who had been standing at one side and merely watching as things went on.

This Teacher Yang was also only in Gushing Spring Tier, but his status was different. The words of a teacher of Hu Yang Academy would naturally be worth more.

Teacher Yang was feeling extremely displeased. Previously, when Feng Luo took advantage of his position to kick Li Hao around and had completely ignored the rules of the Academy, he was already very displeased. However, he had received the command to cooperate with Feng Luo in every way he required before he had come, and so could only conceal his displeasure in his heart.

When he saw how Ling Han had stomped Feng Luo into the ground, he was actually very pleased, and had secretly praised Ling Han. Yet he never thought that Feng Luo and his accomplices were really too shameless. When it was them breaking the rules, they had pretended he was not present at all, and now that it was others breaking the same rules, they actually pushed him out into this matter.

He really did not want to involve himself in this matter, but when he recalled the command he had received earlier on, he could only sigh helplessly and said, “Ling Han, it is forbidden to injure others within the Academy grounds. Aren’t you going to let go of him?”

When these words were spoken, everyone else instantly erupted in an uproar.

What did that mean? Just now, when Feng Luo was going to injure Li Hao grievously, why had he not said such words?

“Is this still the Academy?”

“No, no, no. Is this still the Hu Yang Academy of Rain Country? Why do I feel as if the Academy is now owned by the Feng Clan?”

“That’s right. Even the Imperial Princes and Princesses have to follow the rules when they are in the Academy. Could it be that Feng Yan and Feng Luo are even above the Imperial Family of Rain Country in status?”

“Heh, I disagree!”

“Me too!”

They all began to shout loudly. It was Li Hao today, but it could be any of them tomorrow. When there was no restriction enforced on them by the rules, the consequences would be too widespread. Naturally, everyone felt fear and apprehension in face of such a reality.

Teacher Yang could not help but become speechless. He had been feeling guilty in the first place, and now, he naturally was unable to present a righteous front.

On one side, he had his orders, but on the other, he also had his own ethics to conform to. As his orders and ethics came into a conflict, he finally sighed and said, “I am not going to take control of this matter anymore!” He directly turned around and left, and was really not planning on getting involved in this issue anymore.

The four Guardian Deities were all ashen, and humphed at his actions.

“Ling Han, what do you want in order to release Young Master Luo?” the Elephant Guardian Deity asked.

Ling Han merely glanced at him, then said, “That’s easy. He caused severe injuries to my friend, and even intended to slice off one of his arms. Then I will beat him half-dead, and slice off both his arms. That’s all.”

“You’re going too far!” the Wolf Guardian Deity shouted furiously.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “I’m the type of person who will seek revenge for the smallest grievance. Anyone who breaks one of my fingers, I will break his arm in vengeance. I have only doubled the punishment this time round, so that is already pretty merciful of me!”

“You dare!” The four Guardian Deities all charged towards Ling Han at the same time. They wanted to create a storm of attacks that would make Ling Han not have the chance to make a move on Feng Luo. As long as they managed to rescue Feng Luo… Ling Han was only in Element Gathering Tier, so no matter how strange he was, how far could he go?

Ling Han’s foot gave a flick, and Feng Luo immediately emerged from the ground. He picked Feng Luo up and waved him around as if he was a weapon to parry the attacks of the four Guardian Deities.

When he used this human weapon, the four Guardian Deities naturally dared not press their attack any further and quickly stepped back.

At this moment, a young man merely in Element Gathering Tier was seen to be greatly showing off his might, forcing four elites of Gushing Spring Tier to retreat pathetically, not daring to parry even a single attack.

“Despicable! Shameless!” the four Guardian Deities all shouted angrily.
