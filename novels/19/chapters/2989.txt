Zhou Heng glanced at Ling Han, and a smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Since we’re not battling against Hysteria at the moment, playing some pranks shouldn’t be an issue.”

In other words, the animosity between Ling Han and Golden Silk Moth was only a joke.

If it was only a joke, then would there be any need for others to interfere?

Feng Wuding wanted to dispute this, but he quickly realized that he couldn’t find a good counterargument.

Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, so was there any fear of Golden Silk Moth being pranked to death by Ling Han?

Feng Wuding glowered at Ling Han before sweeping his gaze across Zhou Heng and Chu Hao. He committed these three people to memory. When he advanced to the Seventh Tier, he would definitely make these people regret their decisions.

He was the Son of Destiny! Disobeying him was equivalent to becoming enemies of the Genesis World!

‘Just you wait and see!’ He humphed in his mind.

He turned around and quickly left.

This was already the furthest that he could reach, so there wouldn’t be any point in staying here for longer.

Ten Thousand Shadows hurriedly ran after Feng Wuding. Otherwise, if Ling Han, Chu Hao, and Zhou Heng decided to play a “prank” on him as well, then wouldn’t he be screwed?

Anyhow, it wasn’t like Golden Silk Moth would be killed, so he would just have to tolerate this for a while longer. Once Chong Yan and the others heard about this, they would definitely come over to settle things with Ling Han. There was no need for Ten Thousand Shadows to prematurely lead the charge.

Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang also took their leave. Only Chu Hao and Zhou Heng remained.

“We’ve reaped quite some benefits, so we need to enter seclusion for a while to stabilize our cultivation,” Zhou Heng said. “When the time comes, I’m afraid that Hysteria will attack us and start the battle again.”

“See you later,” Chu Hao said with a nod.

“Ling Han, don’t take the pranks too far,” Zhou Heng warned before leaving with Chu Hao.

Ling Han glanced at the golden silkworm in his hand, and a smile involuntarily spread across his face. Since he couldn’t kill this bug, he would naturally toy with it to his heart’s content. Otherwise, what fun would it be?

“Ling Han, hurry up and release me!” Golden Silk Moth bellowed. He was filled with despair. So many elites with a battle prowess at the Seventh Tier had come just then, yet they had still failed to set him free.

“So noisy!”

Ling Han unleashed a tad more power, causing the restriction around Golden Silk Moth to become more stable. Even his voice couldn’t travel out now.

Ling Han looked at the deep pit in front of him, but he didn’t enter it. Instead, he went to another location, and also burrowed down.

He wanted to personally witness the magnificent sight of fundamental particles crystallizing into a wall. In terms of deciding not to follow Extermination, was there any need to explain this? Or perhaps he wanted to seek death?

Ling Han burrowed into the earth, and after a short while, a wall appeared in front of him.

It was very hard to describe this wall. At one moment, it appeared red, yet at another moment, it suddenly appeared green. In the next moment, it would then appear multicolored. The wall continued to transform. Not only this, but its shape also continued to change. This wall didn’t have a set appearance.

This was a barrier formed by the fundamental particles, and it sealed the path to the dimensions below.

Ling Han reached over to touch the wall.

Golden Silk Moth couldn’t help but snicker coldly when he saw this.

He had already come here before, and he had also reached over to touch the wall of fundamental particles. However, he had immediately been sent flying.

This was an overwhelming power, and it was as if all of the power from the Genesis World of the last era was concentrated in this one place. In fact, this power was so immense that perhaps only Hysteria would be able to resist it. Otherwise, even those at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier wouldn’t be helpless before this wall.

If this weren’t the case, why would Lin Luo and the others have stopped here?

When Ling Han’s hand touched the wall, the fundamental particles would reply with a terrifying repulsive force. Since his physique wasn’t indestructible and undying, Ling Han would definitely suffer a tremendous blow. It wouldn’t be surprising if he suffered some minor wounds, either.

As for Golden Silk Moth?

He wouldn’t be affected at all.

Thus, not only would he be able to break free at that time, but there might even be an opportunity for him to counterattack and kill Ling Han.

‘Brat, hurry up and touch it… Go on, touch it!’ Golden Silk Moth yelled in his mind.

To have a Seventh Tier ultimate elite begging for someone to touch a wall in their mind… This was most likely a historical first.

Ling Han’s hand continued to creep forward. However, it suddenly paused just as it was about to make contact with the wall of fundamental particles.

He was considering the potential dangers.

When fundamental particles burned, they would form boundless karmic flames that approached the Seventh Tier in might. Thus, even Ling Han would have to unleash his full strength to resist it. Now that these fundamental particles had directly formed a wall, would their destructive power be even more petrifying?

If he touched it, would he suffer any injuries?

One had to keep in mind that Ling Han was still suppressing a Seventh Tier ultimate elite. Once he became wounded, he would no longer have the ability to suppress Golden Silk Moth. At that time, Golden Silk Moth would break free and turn the tables on him.

He had to prepare for this possibility. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Release Golden Silk Moth?

Ling Han shook his head. He hadn’t been joking when he said that he wanted to take Golden Silk Moth as a pet. He had been completely serious.

He pondered for a moment before adding several layers of restrictions around Golden Silk Moth that would be effective for around two hours. After that, the restrictions would slowly weaken, at which time Golden Silk Moth would be able to break free.

Ling Han casually tossed Golden Silk Moth aside.

He then reached over to touch the wall again.

Golden Silk Moth experienced a rollercoaster of emotions, going between disappointment and anticipation. When he saw Ling Han finally reach over to touch the wall, his heart beat so fast that it was about to leap into his throat.

‘Brat, you’re done for!’

He wanted to directly shout this. Even though the restrictions around him would imprison him for two hours or so, Ling Han would need at least a few months to recover from the wounds that he was about to suffer. Golden Silk Moth had a ton of time.

He was filled with sheer delight, and he felt as if his blood was pumping around his body in excitement. In fact, the only other time he had felt such excitement was probably when he advanced to the Seventh Tier.

However, he almost bit his tongue off in shock in the next moment.

What did he see?

Not only was Ling Han not sent flying by the wall of fundamental particles, but his hand even sank inside the wall as if it weren’t an impassable wall that could stop even Seventh Tier ultimate elites. It was as if the wall were made from water.

‘F*ck! How is this possible?!’

Golden Silk Moth’s eyes widened in shock, and his mind went completely blank.

To say nothing of him, even Ling Han was filled with surprise.

He hadn’t been overly ambitious, and he hadn’t dreamed about passing through this wall of fundamental particles. After all, even Lin Luo and the others weren’t able to do this. Moreover, his strength was nowhere near powerful enough, so it would naturally be impossible for him to do this anyway.

Perhaps Ling Han would become powerful enough to blast this wall of fundamental particles apart when he advanced to the Sixth or Seventh Tier.

His aim was simply to touch the wall of fundamental particles to see whether he could master the remaining two particles. At that time, he would be able to ascend to the Seventh Tier in a single breath. Even though his power wouldn’t increase by much, his physique would reach a state of invincibility, thus removing his current disadvantage.

Unexpectedly, however, the wall of fundamental particles didn’t unleash a formidable repulsive force against him. Instead, it became soft and gentle like water, allowing his hand to easily pass through.

Was this a case of kindness before violence? Was the wall of fundamental particles waiting for him to completely enter it before unleashing the killing blow?

Ling Han suddenly felt a little regret at this moment. He should have asked Zhou Heng about this wall of fundamental particles.
