Chapter 2143: Another familiar person

Naturally, Ling Han chose to go.

Thus, when Manager Chen brought the message back from Ling Han, Shang Zhiwei deliberately summoned both him and An Ran. She did not speak of the matter of Hu Niu at all, and merely reminded them to be especially careful, as benevolent as a mother.

This caused An Ran to clench her fists in anger. Initially, this had been concern and love that she enjoyed alone, yet now she had to share it with Ling Han, which made it very hard for her to accept.

‘Fine, you have snatched what belongs to me, and I will definitely make you suffer after we enter into the Mystery Realm!’ she internally swore.

“An Ran…” Shang Zhiwei suddenly looked towards her.

“Master.” An Ran hurriedly half-knelt.

“I’ll entrust Ling Han to you. You must not let any harm come to him!” Shang Zhiwei said sternly. How could she be ignorant of this disciple’s personality? Thus, she directly gave her forewarning.

Ah?

An Ran’s mouth gaped half open. With her personality, if she were to agree, it would be absolutely impossible that she wouldn’t keep her promise. Otherwise, how would she be able to call Shang Zhiwei her master again?

However, to ask her to tolerate Ling Han for the whole journey, and have to guarantee his safety at the same time, how could she accept that?

“En?” Shang Zhiwei’s slender brows furrowed in a slight frown.

“Yes, Master.” An Ran nodded reluctantly.

Only now did Shang Zhiwei break into a smile. She glanced at Ling Han, then turned to look at An Ran, and felt that this was really a match made in heaven, causing her to involuntarily recall how she and the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable would’ve been in their youth, if that b*tch, Tianyun, had not appeared.

Involuntarily, her killing intent blazed.?Boom, multiple depressions appeared in the palace. A storm surged out from the void, but was immediately sliced to pieces by her killing intent.

When a Ninth Heaven Celestial King raged, even the heaven and earth would be moved.

“Go on.” She waved them off.

Ling Han and An Ran quickly left, firstly because they both had thoughts on their minds, and secondly because a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was angered, and the pressure was too heavy to stay beside her.

After some slight preparations, Ling Han and the rest then set out.

This time, it was the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King leading them!

It was just a few juniors going off to adventure in a Mystery Realm, so why was there any need to mobilize a Seventh Heaven Celestial King? This naturally was due to Shang Zhiwei’s high regard. Whether it was An Ran or Ling Han, she considered them both as her own children, and naturally would not allow anything bad to happen to either of them.

However, there had initially been no need for the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King to step out for this matter personally, yet he took the initiative to take this job, so it was naturally impossible that Shang Zhiwei would refuse.

Thus, the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King scooped up the three young people, and directly tore a rip into space, setting out towards the Wide Change Heaven.

A mere five days later, he stopped. They had already arrived at the Wide Change Heaven.

The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King’s figure slowed, and slowly advanced with the three juniors. However, Celestial Kings had heaven-defying power. Ling Han was obviously just using normal speed to travel, yet he still did not fall back behind An Ran and Lin Xuan, far surpassing the speed that he could reach.

In truth, Lin Xuan and An Ran’s speed was also faster than their usual rate. This was because the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had boosted them with a certain celestial technique, yet they did not feel anything at all, as if this was very normal.

In this way, they had only spent another day to arrive at the location of that Mystery Realm.

Ling Han’s expression became strange because he knew this place.

It was not that he had been here before, but rather that he had seen it on a map.

…After he had won the first place in the alchemy tournament, the prize was an ancient map, and it was said that there was a several hundred billion years old Celestial medicine hidden in the location where the hidden treasure was shown on the map, and it was within this Mystery Realm.

What a coincidence.

This Mystery Realm had only appeared not too long ago. Initially, this had been a sea, but in the last few years, the sea waters rapidly evaporated, revealing a gigantic pit. Then, the pit cracked apart, revealing another world.

Ling Han deliberately swept a glance over the ancient map, and discovered that there should have been a Transference Portal that could allow entry, but some unknown change had taken place, causing the sea waters to evaporate, and the Mystery Realm to reveal itself.

In the skies, multiple figures streaked past, flying into the Mystery Realm.

Ling Han looked down from his lofty position, and saw that incredibly tall trees spread as far as the eye could see. They were several thousand meters tall, and the tree leaves were thick and wide, considerably larger than even the average house.

And the roars of tigers and howls of wolves could vaguely be heard from beneath them. There were also birds flying out from within. Some directly flew far away, while others would fly in a circle, and then return into the Mystery Realm.

“This is a place that has been lost since the Ancient Age.” The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King’s eyes closed slightly, his right hand making a divination beneath his sleeve. A while later, his eyes snapped open, showing an expression of surprise.

The Celestial Realm had existed for who knew how many epochs, but people universally called what was 10 epochs ago the Ancient Age, and what was 100 epochs ago would be called the Primitive Age. Though the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had attained Dao many years ago, he had only been alive for over two epochs, and compared to the Celestial Realm, that was naturally negligible.

It was said that a super great war had erupted before both in the Ancient Age and Primitive Age, and a great many Celestial Kings had died, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Thus, when something was connected with the Ancient Age, even he, a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, would be tempted.

Who knew, there might be a treasure that had been left after the death of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King that would lend him a helping hand, and help him to break through to Eighth Heaven?

“Brother Spiritual Mountain!” A cry rang out, and a man with a thin, lanky build flew down towards them.

“Brother Great Clouds!” When the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King saw him, he offered him a smile, and even nodded in response.

This thin man’s body was wrapped with eight-colored celestial light, showing that he was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King! Why would an Eighth Heaven Celestial King be willing to treat the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King as an equal? Naturally, it was because the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King’s battle prowess was too strong, and there was a place for him even among Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings.

The Great Clouds Celestial King waved a hand, and five young people instantly appeared by his side. These were the juniors that he had brought along with him using a celestial technique.

“Ling Han!” One of the juniors spotted Ling Han, and uncontrollably called out.

Ling Han naturally spotted him as well, and a rueful feeling involuntarily rose up in him. This world was actually quite small.

…Yulan Fenghua, the Holy Son of the Imperial Void Sect.

‘Yi, going by that account, this Great Clouds Celestial King should be a member of the Imperial Void Sect then.’

“So it is Brother Yulan,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

Meanwhile, Yulan Fenghua’s expression was filled with shock. Previously, he had battled Ling Han, and the outcome was a tie, but Ling Han’s cultivation level was lower than his by a minor level, causing his menacing killing intent to rise. He had deliberately chatted with the other party just to probe into Ling Han’s background.

He could confirm that Ling Han was just a lone cultivator, albeit one with heaven-defying good luck, and that was why he would have been so accomplished in cultivation. Thus, he extended an invitation to Ling Han, inviting him to the Imperial Void Sect. There, he would be able to play Ling Han easily to death.

But now he had actually seen Ling Han again, and the latter was actually with the members of the Four Seas Palace.

He was a member of the Four Seas Palace?

He had never heard about someone like him in the Four Seas Palace.

“Hehe, who is this little boy, to actually be acquainted with our Holy Son Yulan?” The Great Clouds Celestial King swept over him, and deliberately voiced the question. That was because he was very familiar with Yulan Fenghua, and he had never seen the latter look so stunned.

At least in front of a peer of equal cultivation levels, both Ling Han and Yulan Fenghua were Heaven Souls.

“Hehe, just a mere junior.” The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King sketched over the details. If Ling Han had a grudge with the Imperial Void Sect, he would not mind using them to get Ling Han killed.

Thus, it was naturally impossible that he would reveal the relationship between Ling Han and Shang Zhiwei.

An Ran was presently angry, so she naturally would not help Ling Han explain, and it was even more so for Lin Xuan.
