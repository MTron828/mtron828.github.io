Chapter 3395= Xue Chiluo

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the sky, a giant eagle spread its wings. It was dozens of metres long and shockingly huge.

It flapped its wings and landed at a height of about 30 metres above the square.

At this moment, everyone could clearly see that there were more than ten people standing on the giant eagle.

However, the giant eagle was too huge. It was a piece of cake for more than ten people to stand there.

They were all from the Demon Race, male and female.

The Demon Race was really arrogant. The Dark North Nation was already mobilizing for a huge battle, but they came over in such a grand manner. Were they trying to show off?

Alright, they wouldn’t be able to return. It was a good opportunity they could take to annoint their war banner with their blood.

Everyone drew their weapons, their fighting spirits already high.

Many of these second-generation young masters bullied the weak and feared the strong. They were afraid of going to the battlefield to kill the enemy, but now, there were only a dozen or so opponents. What was there to be afraid of?

There was only one word for it, fight.

-Who is in charge of this place?” Someone from the Demon Race asked. This was a slender old man. Other than his two sharp ears, there was almost no difference between him and a human.

However, as soon as he spoke, at least half of those gathered flopped down and

lost their fighting spirit.

It was too terrifying. This aura was simply like a blood demon returning from the hellish battlefield. It directly made people collapse.

Although the remaining half was still standing, they could only stand. They could not even move their legs.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, the Four Great Generals, Yang Bai, and Grand Tutor Hong jumped over at the same time, fear flashing across their faces.

This elder was too powerful, far surpassing the Inscription Tier.

“I am the general of the Yue Empire’s Red Eagle Army, Xue Chiluo!” The old man spoke. His voice was like metal and was filled with destructive power.

The general of the Red Eagle Army!

The expressions of the Four Great Generals all changed drastically. They had already learned from the Third Prince that the commander of the Red Eagle Army was a Mystery Realm Tier elite. In other words, this Xue Chiluo was two whole cultivation levels higher than them.

Two major cultivation levels, not two minor levels!

Not to mention them, even if that freakish genius, Hong Tianbu, came, he could only lower his head in front of Xue Chiluo.

Xue Chiluo swept his gaze across the crowd, and a look of contempt appeared

on his face. Weak, how weak.

“So it’s one of the three Great Generals of the Demon Race, General Xue, who has arrived.” With a long laugh, the elder princes also appeared. Even when facing a supreme elite of the Mystery Realm Tier, they had no fear at all.

“That’S more like it.” Xue Chiluo swept his gaze across the princes and put away his contempt. They were in the Enlightenment Tier; they were finally not so weak that he could not even be bothered to take a look.

‘En?’

The Seventh Prince and the others, including Xue Chiluo, all turned to look behind them.

“Father, it seems that an incredible fellow has arrived,” Sixth Baby said by Ling Han’s ear. She had been sitting on Ling Han’s shoulder the entire time, while the other children were all in the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

Ling Han couldn’t see it, but he had a vague feeling that some terrifying existence was rapidly approaching.

Unfortunately, he could not call Second Baby out now. With her ocular skills, she would definitely be able to see it clearly.

However, a moment later, a green light appeared in the sky. Soon, this light appeared in the square and a middle-aged man appeared.

Eh, this was actually a prince. One could tell from his clothes.

His aura was vigorous, and his skin and limbs were actually green. It was as if

he was sick or had cultivated some strange cultivation technique.

“Big Brother!” The three princes called out one after another.

This was Chen Fengyan’s first son, Chen Xingyu.

Ling Han also couldn’t help but look towards Chen Xingyu. Since Sixth Baby said that this person was extraordinary, there must be something shocking about him.

“Oh, I understand.” Sixth Baby nodded, although no one could see it.

Ling Han lowered his voice, and asked, “What did you see?

“Father, this guy is an Azure Star Physique,” Sixth Baby said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Innate Divine Physique?” Ling Han asked. He had already learned from the Calabash Brothers that there were natural Divine Physiques in the world. A Divine Physique was born with incomparably freakish natural talent in martial arts, and also possessed various natural talents. Fighting an opponent with a higher cultivation level was as simple and natural as eating and drinking for them.

“Yes, although it’s not that terrifying among Innate Divine Physiques, it’s already very powerful to be called an Innate Divine Physique.” Sixth Baby nodded and said seriously, although it was a waste since no one could see her.

Azure Star Physique?

While Ling Han was talking to Sixth Baby, Chen Xingyu also nodded at his younger brothers, then looked at Xue Chiluo, and said, “I didn’t expect that a general of the Demon Race would actually come to visit personally. Forgive me for not coming out to welcome you.”

Xue Chiluo’s eyes narrowed. “Are you the First Prince?

“That’s right, I am.” Chen Xingyu nodded in a majestic manner.

From this point of view, he was very similar to Chen Fengyan. It was unknown if it was because he was his first son or if he was deliberately imitating him. Xue Chiluo completely retracted his contempt, and said, “As expected of the Holy Emperor’s bloodline, actually having cultivation at the Mystery Realm Tier!”

What, the Eldest Imperial Prince had already advanced into the Mystery Realm Tier?

Everyone was shocked. Even the Third Prince and the others were shocked. Although cultivation level didn’t represent everything, Chen Xingyu was currently at the top, and was the only Mystery Realm Tier among the princes. This naturally added a lot of points to him.

The First Prince smiled faintly and said, “General Xue, what brings you here?” Xue Chiluo looked at the Eldest Prince and took a deep breath. “On behalf of His Majesty, I’ve specially come—”

He paused for a moment, as if he found it difficult to speak. After a long pause, he said, “To hand over a declaration of surrender!”

Puff!

Everyone spluttered in shock.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

Deliver a letter of surrender?

Haha!

The Demon Race had sent out envoys twice to demand the surrender of the Dark North Nation. After that, they had even brazenly threatened that if the Dark North Nation did not hand Ling Han over, they would send troops to attack.

Being so arrogant, why would they suddenly send a letter of surrender? Moreover, although the strength of the Demon Race had not been publicized openly, as long as one’s status was high enough, they would know how terrifying the Demon Race was. Not to mention an entire country attacking, even if they sent out any one of the three armies, it would be enough to sweep through the Dark North Nation.

In a situation where their abilities were completely superior, the Demon Race actually sent a Great General to present a surrender letter?

‘How can I believe that?’

Even daydreams would not be so unrealistic.

“Oh, is that true?” Although the First Prince was also shocked, his face immediately regained its indifference.

Xue Chiluo revealed a look of humiliation. He had come on behalf of the Yue Empire to deliver the surrender letter. This was not a glorious thing. How could he be in the mood to joke? He said in a low voice, “Why would I joke about such a thing?”

Then it was true.

Thinking about it, it made sense. Even if it was a joke, no one would joke about this kind of thing like this. He said in front of so many people that he wanted to present a surrender letter.

However, the problem was that they had already analyzed it before. The Demon Race had no reason to lower their heads at all. This made everyone confused.

The Eldest Prince had the temperament of his father. He was calm and composed. He immediately smiled and said, “Oh, since the Yue Empire is willing to surrender, then Lord Yang, come over and preside over it.” Although he was the eldest prince, the person in charge was Yang Bai. He could not overstep his authority..
