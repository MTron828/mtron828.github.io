Chapter 1784: Give yourself then

Bewitching Maiden Rou pushed herself up with her hands. It was only a single action, but it fully displayed the elegance and languid nature that was purely feminine. Her hair of black locks cascaded like a waterfall, revealing one side of her exquisite face.

Fu Gaoyun instantly stared dumbly at her.

Ling Han felt rueful. No wonder Fu Gaoyun was even willing to surrender a Celestial medicine to her whole-heartedly at the time. This bewitching maiden was really a huge calamity. There were definitely not many men that could withstand her charisma.

However, if the Empress was willing to open her mouth, it was guaranteed that even women would be captivated to dizziness by her.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s action was very slow, exhibiting the enticement of the body to the fullest, but when she saw that Fu Gaoyun was practically about to salivate, while Ling Han was completely unmoved, the surprise in her heart increased even more.

Could it be that she really had to actively use her charm technique to be able to lure this guy?

Her use and grasp of charm techniques had already reached perfection, and would not fall into disadvantage. What the charm techniques compounded on was her personal charisma, and not something as simple as making the target feel a need in that particular area.

For men that saw her, what they wanted more was to possess her, and not to impatiently take her for their own.

But why were charm techniques called charm techniques?

When she actively used her charm techniques, the enticement it rendered on men was fatal. They would be filled with an urge to possess her at all costs, and when it had really reached that time, she would take advantage of the opening to make her move, so it was naturally very easy for her.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s delicate hand shook, and an ancient book appeared on the table. It was very seriously damaged, and should have been corroded by the power of time.

“Young Master Fu, as well as this little sister, please withdraw,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said. She feared that these two people would memorize the cultivation technique. If Ling Han was unable to restore it, they could still bring the incomplete technique and find another to help them.

Fu Gaoyun did not say another word. He immediately stood up, turned, and exited the room.

He could even surrender a Celestial medicine to her wholeheartedly, so what was a mere cultivation technique worth to him?

The Empress ignored her, though, and only cast a disdainful glance at Bewitching Maiden Rou. She wanted to boss her around? Humph!

“This little sister!” Bewitching Maiden Rou fixed her eyes on the Empress, and her gaze involuntarily became tense.

What a perfect figure!

Furthermore, though her face was veiled, her noble and poised demeanor was still hard to conceal, filling others with the desire of wanting to kneel at her feet and worship her.

Shock filled her heart. It should be known that she was a woman herself, and had cultivated charm techniques at that, so her will was incredibly strong. And even with all this, she actually felt the impulse to kneel at the other woman’s feet and worship her?

Hiss, just how strong was this woman’s charm?

“Little Sister, how should I address you?” she asked, thinking, ‘Could it be that this woman has also cultivated some kind of charm technique, and that was why my heart was beating faster?’

The Empress stretched out a hand and knocked on the back of the chair as she said, “Call me Big Sister!”

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but feel angry. She was the Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect; furthermore, she was the only heir. In the future, she was definitely going to become the sect leader of the Purity Sect, and take possession of a three-star force, and you actually wanted her to call you a big sister?

“LIttle Sister, you have very strong self-confidence!” she stated slowly.

The Empress only cast her a sidelong glance. If the other party didn’t call her big sister, she couldn’t even feel bothered to talk with her.

F***, she had actually been ignored!

Bewitching Maiden Rou was dumbfounded. What was wrong with this world? An exquisite calamity like her would actually experience being ignored? She was about to say something else, but when she saw that Ling Han was already flipping through the ancient book, she forcibly closed her mouth.

She definitely could not afford to disturb Ling Han now.

Ling Han flipped through very quickly, and wherever his eyes passed, the Nine Heavens Flame would flicker, and then those missing letters would appear one after another.

The majority of the text was very normal, but there was also some that was incredibly ancient. In fact, it couldn’t even be called text. There was only one symbol, the symbol of great dao! This could only be inscribed by supreme elites, and others would not be able to form this kind of symbol in their minds at all.

...This required a very high comprehension of great dao.

This kind of symbol could suppress the heaven and earth and lock time. Thus, not one of these symbols on the ancient book had been damaged. In truth, it was precisely because of these symbols that this ancient book had managed to last for so many years. Otherwise, it would have long since been corroded and turned into nothing.

Ling Han quickly flipped through once. He closed his eyes, and the whole cultivation technique instantly appeared in his mind, exuding the light of great dao. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If he presently shirked and said that he could not restore it, he would be able to possess this Celestial King cultivation technique alone.

However, he was not that kind of person; he was not someone who could kick someone to the curb when they outlived their usefulness. Moreover, even if others obtained it, they would only be capable of controlling the normal Fire Element of heaven and earth, but he was able to control the Nine Heavens Flame. There was absolutely no comparison in might between the two.

Thus, after pondering a while, he drew out pen and paper, and began writing on it.

The letters flowed smoothly, but when he reached those symbols of great dao, Ling Han could not copy them, and could only indicate which page of the original book they were on. He wrote very quickly, and after slightly over an hour, a whole cultivation technique was already complete.

‘That’s all?’

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but feel stunned. She had also passed this cultivation technique to be viewed by her master, who was the sect leader of the Purity Sect, Nan Suyu, but the latter had not written a single letter even after many years of studying.

This was the fruit of the heart and blood of a Celestial King, and a mere Immortal Palace Tier wanted to restore it? She had to be joking.

But Ling Han actually finished it after using only half a day’s time. This was too astonishing!

‘It can’t be that you were only writing randomly, right?’

Bewitching Maiden Rou took the manuscript over, and hurriedly flipped through it. The more she read, the more shocked she felt, and also the more excited—this was clearly, undoubtedly, and definitely the complete cultivation technique.

If she was asked to create a Celestial King technique, that was an absolutely impossible feat, but if it was merely to distinguish the authenticity of a cultivation technique, she was at least 90% confident. That was because if something was off with the cultivation technique, it would naturally be sluggish as she went over it in her mind.

Prodigy!

No, no, no, how could this be anything as simple as a prodigy? She didn’t even know what words she could use to describe him.

...She only knew that this cultivation technique was very amazing, but was not clear that this was actually a Celestial King secret technique. Otherwise, she would definitely be twice as stunned.

However, it was really a coincidence. Otherwise, whichever other cultivation technique it was, it was guaranteed that Ling Han could not possibly think through a single letter even if he spent a few hundred million years. But who asked things to be really so coincidental?

“Young Master Ling, I will remember this favor.” Bewitching Maiden Rou smiled beautifully. This was really a huge favor. Even if she gave him a few Celestial medicines, it would not be enough to repay this favor.

...If she knew that this was a Celestial King technique, then she would really have no idea how she was to express her thanks.

“There is no need to remember. Just give yourself then,” the Empress suddenly spoke up.

Bewitching Maiden Rou suddenly showed a hint of embarrassment, but her beautiful face was still all smiles as she said, “This little sister is really fond of her jokes! However, if I really did marry Young Master Ling, wouldn’t little sister have to worry?”

Worry about what?

Naturally, worry about Ling Han’s sole favor. As a woman that was so beautiful and alluring, she was practically a witch that was capable of luring others to their deaths with her charm. What man would cast another woman a second look once they had her?

This was a counter-checkmate.

The Empress was unmoved, and said, “That cultivation technique will become your dowry. Come, let’s go.”

You really took it seriously, huh!

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s expression stiffened, and she said, “This little sister, you should know when to stop your jokes.”

Yet the Empress was insistent. “Husband, grab her!”
