3050 Getting Information

If Hysteria didn’t appear, then no matter how many monsters came, it would still be useless.

Ling Han attacked to his heart’s content. This was not the Profound Negative Realm, and he was not at all worried that the battle would be too intense and destroy the Profound Negative Realm.

Hysteria was the one who was going to be destroyed.

With Ling Han’s current strength, which other monster could withstand his attack?

With a single punch, they were all destroyed.

He was wreaking havoc. This should be able to have some effect on Hysteria. Even if it was only a negligible effect, it should be able to reduce the pressure on Lin Luo and the others in the main battlefield.

Ling Han let out a long howl, and transformed into a long dragon as he charged forward, destroying everything he saw.

Up in the sky, he dismantled the walls of the cave, only to discover to his surprise that he had actually entered another cave after blasting the walls to a certain extent.

Similarly, the ground beneath his feet was uneven, and there were holes everywhere. It was the same above his head, which was covered with plants with huge fruits hanging from them.

It was the same down below. It was as if the entire dimension was Hysteria’s military factory.

Ling Han attacked to his heart’s content. His battle prowess had already far surpassed a normal peak-stage Seventh Tier’s, so how terrifying was his destructive power? With a single strike, the heavens and earth would collapse.

However, this was both a dimension and Hysteria’s body at the same time, and its sturdiness far exceeded that of the Profound Negative Realm and the Flaming Frost Realm of before. Even if Ling Han attacked with all his might, that attack could only destroy a mountain.

If they were in the Profound Negative Realm, Ling Han’s attack would definitely have a great power capable of destroying hundreds of millions of mountains.

The ground here was as tough as Devouring Metal at the level of Great Accomplishment… No, it should be said that it was very similar to the materials used to build the city walls of the Realm Battlefield. Even Sixth Tier elites would find it very difficult to break through it. Even with Ling Han’s battle prowess, the destruction he could cause was still limited.

However, Ling Han was extremely satisfied.

Because Hysteria had manifested as a dimension, and was already at the Seventh Tier, this meant that he shouldn’t have been able to damage this place at all.

But now, he could do it. What did this mean?

Hysteria had manifested as a dimension, but a dimension was too big, causing its power to be dispersed, and thus affecting its defense. It couldn’t reach the level of indestructibility that a Seventh Tier ought to attain.

Or perhaps Hysteria hadn’t completely manifested as a dimension, and its true body or core was still hidden in some corner. Therefore, indestructibility was only applicable to that part.

Which one was it?

Perhaps both of these two guesses were wrong.

Ling Han didn’t mind. Since he could damage this place now, what was there to be polite about?

‘Die!’

He unleashed the power in his body. It was endless, and the five fundamental powers could be continuously absorbed. Even if this was Hysteria’s territory, and he might be targeted, Ling Han could still communicate with the Void, where the fundamental power was even more abundant.

The Power of Dimension in his body was endless, and it was being generated at every moment. If he didn’t use it, it would increase the strength of his dimensions, and he similarly wouldn’t have to worry about running out of energy.

Where was Hysteria? Why hadn’t it appeared yet? Was it just going to watch helplessly as its creations were destroyed?

Ordinary monsters were fine, but there were also those mother trees that could nurture monsters. Ling Han believed that these were treasures that Hysteria needed to value.

The monster army was also coming out of the holes in the cave walls continuously like a swarm of ants. However, what was the use of having more monsters?

Ling Han only needed to exert his power, and the monsters would fall one by one, as if he was harvesting wheat.

The self-destructing monsters had also appeared, but even if a monster with Seventh-Tier battle prowess exploded around Ling Han, it would be useless. His defense was more than 100 times stronger than when he had been at the Fifth Tier, wasn’t it?

Otherwise, why would he dare to come to Hysteria’s territory alone?

“Why… do you want to… go against me!” A voice suddenly sounded in Ling Han’s mind, and it was slightly sluggish, as if it had not spoken for too long.

Hysteria?

Was it finally unable to sit still?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and similarly released his divine sense, and said, “You and I are on different sides. Is there a need for other reasons?”

“I single-handedly created you. In the words of humans, you are betraying me!” Hysteria’s voice sounded again.

Ling Han sneered, and said, “You’re not a human, so cut the crap! Besides, you only chose me, and it is not that you created me. Don’t be greedy for credit! Let me ask you, did you choose me because there’s a light spot in my mind?”

Hysteria’s voice did not immediately resound. After a long while, it said, “You can actually discover the secret in your body!”

Although it did not give a direct answer, this was equivalent to admitting that Hysteria did indeed know that there was that light spot in Ling Han’s mind.

Ling Han couldn’t help but start thinking. He had been chosen by Hysteria because of the speck of light in his body, but what about the so-called World’s Will?

Was this light spot credited to it, or had it been attracted by it?

Ling Han did not think too deeply into it. He continued to try to get information out of Hysteria. As an existence that had lived since the Genesis World of the last era, and had always played the role of the greatest villain, Hysteria definitely knew a lot of secrets.

“You should know that your clone from the previous generation has appeared again.”

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud sounds could be heard from all directions. Hysteria might be mobilizing troops, but Ling Han did not care. He wanted to confirm some of his guesses through Hysteria.

“So what? It’s just my previous body that I have shed in my last life. In this life, I’m even stronger!” Hysteria said in a cold voice.

“But don’t you want to know who incited the revival of your previous life?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Hysteria paused for a moment before asking, “Who is it?”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Let’s trade. Tell me, what is the World’s Core?”

“World’s Core?” Hysteria repeated in confusion. “What is this?”

Hysteria actually didn’t know what the World’s Core was?

That shouldn’t be the case.

After all, since the dimensional core was the core of a dimension, the World’s Core should be the core of the Genesis World.

The dimensional core allowed Ten Thousand Shadows and Golden Silk Moth to break through to the Seventh Tier, allowing him to advance to the Fifth Tier as well, gaining Seventh-Tier battle prowess. In that case, could he come up with this deduction—the World’s Core granted the possibility for a Seventh Tier to advance into Eighth Tier?

It was precisely because of this that Chong Yan and the others were so concerned.

But now, Hysteria actually said that it didn’t know what the World’s Core was?

Did it really not know, or was it deliberately hiding the fact that it did?

Ling Han made a judgment internally, but the information he obtained was really too little. He only knew the phrase “World’s Core,” so what could he use as a basis for his judgments?

“The World’s Core is such an important thing, and you actually don’t know about it?” Ling Han said deliberately. “Those few old enemies of yours, like Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the others are all scheming for this thing!”

Hysteria hesitated. Although it had taken the form of a dimension, its intelligence was not inferior at all.

The sudden withdrawal of Chong Yan’s group from the Realm Battlefield didn’t make sense to it. There had to be some kind of conspiracy behind it.

Thus, upon being mentioned by Ling Han, its suspicion instantly intensified. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

What exactly was this World’s Core?

Chong Yan and the others left for this thing?
