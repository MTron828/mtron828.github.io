Chapter 3426: Almost spoiling my big plans

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The honey from the Purple Wasps had been used up, and Ling Han’s physique was improving very slowly at present. Though this powerful pressure could not compare to the honey from the Purple Wasps, it could still boost the improvement of his physique.

He simply stood there, not using any mystical power. He was merely relying on his physical power and willpower to hold on.

In just ten minutes, he felt tremendous pressure, making him want to step back. However, if he pushed himself to the limit, it would improve his physique even more.

He forcefully held on. At this moment, he was relying on his willpower.

Half a day later, Ling Han finally reached his limit. He took a step back and collapsed to the ground, panting heavily.

“Father, I’m hungry!”

“Father, I want a hug.”

The children all gathered around him, all kinds of adorable expressions on their faces.

Ling Han prepared food, and at the same time, he still had to coax the children. He was even more tired than when he had been tempering his body just now. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After finally dismissing the children, Ling Han finally breathed a sigh of relief. After resting for a while, he continued to walk up the steps to temper his body.

This was indeed an extremely good way of tempering, allowing his physique to improve very quickly.

In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

Though Ling Han was cultivating here, the seven babies were not idle either. They searched one palace after another, and though this group of palaces looked awesome, but in truth, there was not much good stuff. Previously, when the owner left, he had moved everything very cleanly, and there really was not much left behind.

Why was this sacrificial hall still full?

It was very simple. This was for the benefit of their ancestors or gods. No matter how valuable it was, they could not possibly take it with them. Otherwise, wouldn’t that be treason?

It was not completely fruitless. Second Baby picked up a hammer. It was purple-gold in colour, and with a wave of the hammer, there would be lightning flickering. Its might could not be underestimated either.

This was a Spirit Tool. It was only a One Star Tool, but it was still above the Celestial Path. If it was taken out, it would definitely cause a great commotion.

On the afternoon of the third day, someone finally came.

Zhi, the great doors of the palace were pushed open, and a group of seven people walked in.

Ling Han looked back, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Seventh Imperial Prince!

The person in the lead was none other than the Seventh Imperial Prince, Chen Taiqing, and behind him were six men and women. There were young and old, men and women, but they all stayed three steps behind Chen Taiqing. Their expressions were filled with respect.

He had not thought that he would meet Chen Taiqing here.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s eyes swept over the sacrificial altar, and his gaze instantly became heated. There were too many Treasured Fruits on it, and they were too precious, causing his greed to involuntarily rise.

Then, he looked towards Ling Han, and a hint of malice immediately appeared on his face.

“Ling Han, I have warned you before to keep your distance from Princess Bixiao. She is not someone that you can reach at all,” the Seventh Imperial Prince stated calmly. After a slight pause, his voice suddenly became cold, “But you have ignored my words!”

Speaking of which, when he found out that Princess Bixiao had “spent the night” at Ling Han’s place, he was furious. He really wanted to rush over to Ling Han’s place and kill this outrageously bold guy.

Who do you think you are? You are merely a dog raised by the Chen Clan, and you actually dare compete with Imperial Princes like them over a woman?

Ling Han smiled faintly. He had been ruthlessly tricked by Princess Bixiao. Now, no matter how he argued, it would be useless. Others would only think that he was still whining even after he had gotten an advantage.

The princess of the Demon Race was really a bewitching maiden. The next time they met, he would definitely hold her down and spank her bottom harshly!

“How can you speak to my father like that?” Eldest Baby said in an experienced manner.

“That’s right. You have to be more polite in front of my father,” Fourth Baby chimed in.

“Kneel!” Fifth Baby also said.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s expression was as dark as water. Ling Han actually had a few kids deal with him; just how much was he being looked down on?

“Your Imperial Highness, allow me to kill him!” Behind him, a sturdy man stepped out, and took the initiative to ask for a battle.

The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded slowly, and said, “Everyone, spread out a bit. The clothing on this person is covered with a formation, which can pull those who are enshrouded into the formation to the same cultivation level.”

“Yes, Your Imperial Highness.” The remaining five men and women dispersed, forming a siege.

Ling Han smiled, and said to the Seventh Imperial Prince, “Your Imperial Highness, is there really any need for us to become enemies like this?”

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s eyes were cold, and he said, “At first, I still had a sliver of cherishing talent, so even if you had almost ruined my important plans in the past, and killed one of my men, I did not intend to kill you.”

“However, you’re an ungrateful wretch who can’t be raised well. If I don’t get rid of you today, how can it be that I’ll let you become stronger?”

What was going on?

Ling Han was astonished. When had he ruined Chen Taiqing’s grand plan? And when had he killed his underling?

Was he referring to the matter of his marriage with Princess Bixiao?

‘You’re already so old. Is there a need to do this?’

No, the matter of Princess Bixiao shouldn’t be called “in the past”, nor could it be called “almost”. It wouldn’t be related to murder either.

But before this, there was no relation between himself and the Seventh Imperial Prince, so why would he say such a thing?

“Hehe.” He chuckled, and couldn’t be bothered to think too much about it. Instead, he focused his gaze on the sturdy man who was striding over.

His eye technique was activated, and he saw that there was a veined pattern on this sturdy man’s heart.

Inscription Tier elite!

After Blood Transformation Tier, it was very difficult to determine the cultivation level of a cultivator. If they didn’t directly exchange blows, how could they determine the cultivation level of their opponent?

However, Ling Han possessed an eye technique that allowed him to see through things to a certain extent. This allowed him to see clearly through things.

If it was Extreme Bone Tier, just look at their bones, while for Inscription Tier, he had to look at the veined patterns on their organs.

He could tell with a single glance.

Following the acceleration of the drastic changes in heaven and earth, Inscription Tier elites finally began to appear in batches. There were quite a number of hidden clans, and now, such existences had also appeared in the hands of the Seventh Imperial Prince.

“Brat, you really should not make an enemy of His Imperial Highness. He is a man that is destined to accomplish endless great feats!” The brawny man threw a punch.

Boom! Although this person was a One Inscription elite, his power was extremely terrifying. Moreover, there was also black-colored energy wrapped around his fists, and they possessed a powerful destructive ability.

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. He felt as if he had heard these words from the sturdy man somewhere before.

Thus, he did not make a move. Instead, he dodged to the side, and dodged this punch.

“Die!” The sturdy man threw another punch.

A thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind. He finally remembered.

Cheng Hu!

When he was in Huju City, he had once killed a Demonic Beast during the chaos. That Demonic Beast was quite unusual, specializing in spiritual power, and after its death, it would leave behind something called Blood Divine Crystal.

Afterwards, Cheng Hu sought him out, and poisoned him with the extreme poison of the Soul Departing Pill. If there was no antidote after a year, he would die.

However, it wasn’t long before Ling Han resolved the poison of the Soul Departing Pill and killed Cheng Hu.

However, he did not manage to get any information about the mighty figure behind the scenes from Cheng Hu, and thus became an unsolved case.

From Cheng Hu’s mouth, that Master of his was highly revered by him, and thought that he could achieve grand ambitions.

Wasn’t this the same tone as the brawny man?

Furthermore, the Seventh Imperial Prince had previously said that Ling Han had almost ruined his important business, and had even killed one of his men.

Hiss, could it be that the boss behind the scenes was the Seventh Imperial Prince?
