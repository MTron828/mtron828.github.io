Chapter 2547: Exploding fruits

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everyone felt disgusted. Only the large black dog would tell such a hardcore joke.

Yet the lightning giant was completely unconcerned. He sat still as stone, as if there was no life to him.

However, the stone tablet was right underneath his behind, so if they wanted to drip some blood on the stone tablet, they definitely had to approach.

“He is unfathomable,” the Imperial Void Celestial King said solemnly.

He Runhai nodded. “In the information I have obtained, there was no reference to this living being that is manifested from lightning.”

“Perhaps, as time passed, strange changes have taken place,” the Imperial Void Celestial King said.

“Possibly,” He Runhai expressed his agreement. He took a deep breath, and raised his right hand. A fiery red spear suddenly appeared in his grip. It was only about three meters long, and it was completely formed from Regulations. There were still flames flickering on it.

Xiu, he threw it out with all his might, and the fiery spear immediately shot out quickly, flying rapidly towards that lightning giant.

The fiery spear was extremely fast. In a flash, it had already arrived at the chest of the lightning giant, but before it managed to pierce down, a jade-blue lightning bolt streaked past. With a?pa, this flaming spear was shattered.

The Imperial Void Celestial King, He Runhai, and the large black dog exclaimed in surprise. They were giving this lightning giant extremely high regard.

Though that flaming spear might not be a full-power strike from He Runhai, the lightning giant had still so easily destroyed this attack without even a single movement. His strength was definitely extraordinary.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?Right at this moment, small figures endlessly leaped out of the body of that lightning giant. They, too, were formed from lightning, and the moment they appeared, they turned into spheres of electricity that shot rapidly towards them.

The three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings humphed at the same time. They admitted that the lightning giant’s strength was great, but they did not think that they were outmatched. Yet this guy had actually provoked all three of them at the first move; did that mean he thought that he could face off against all three of them at the same time?

This naturally angered the large black dog and the others. They threw a punch, and shot out a frightening wave of Regulations that blasted towards those tiny figures.

Zi, these spheres of electricity shook strongly, rapidly shrinking, but their path was not altered. They were still fiercely shooting towards them.

“Whoa!” the large black dog shouted loudly. “This guy is so awesome!” He threw out another paw, forming a shield of light in front of him.

Meanwhile, Ling Han pushed Wally directly in front of him, while he himself and the Empress ducked behind him.

“…” Wally.

Everyone used their own methods. The lightning giant’s battle prowess was too amazing. With a single strike, he had actually broken through the combined forces of three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, though his attack had also been weakened many times over.

Crack!

Lightning flashed madly, turning into a great explosion, and making for a very astonishing display.

After the lightning had disappeared, aside from the three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, Ling Han, and the Empress, the others were more or less injured slightly, and Wally himself was covered with injuries, which looked as if they had been sliced out with a supreme Divine Sword.

But now that the lightning had disappeared, these injuries were healing up automatically. His recovery ability was definitely not inferior to Heavenborn’s.

“You have angered me!” The large black dog leaped out, and as his claws flashed out, he shot out a wave of shadowy light that was filled with terrifying destructive power.

The lightning giant finally moved. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had already charged to face him directly. He had to deal with him seriously.

He threw a punch, which struck at the large black dog.

Boom!

The lightning and the shadowy light clashed, canceling each other out, and what was more terrifying, the space itself was also being destroyed, forming areas of compression and distortion.

“Retreat!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. The great battle between two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was extremely terrifying in itself, and watching the battle from nearby was merely courting death.

Only the Imperial Void Celestial King and He Runhai were still standing where they were. They were both Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so they naturally were unafraid of this kind of resulting shock wave.

Usually, the large black dog was completely playful, so it was very easy for others to overlook the fact that he was actually a supreme elite of Ninth Heaven, and one that was a supreme monarch star at that. His battle prowess was so outstanding that practically only a Heavenly Venerate could suppress him.

In this battle, he had finally shown the battle prowess that belonged to a top-tier Celestial King.

The large black dog was indeed very strong, but the lightning giant was not weak, either. He was incredibly aggressive as he brandished the lightning bolts that filled the air. He was not at a disadvantage at all in this forceful clash with the large black dog.

Wally’s eyes shone with green light as he began to scan this lightning giant.

“How is it?” Ling Han asked from the side.

Wally nodded. “He is made from countless lightning beings, and that is why he has such powerful battle prowess.”

Ling Han gave an oh; no wonder then.

The large black dog was a Ninth Heaven supreme monarch star, and if just anyone could just simply match him, then wouldn’t a supreme monarch star be too worthless?

This lightning giant was formed from countless lightning beings, and only gained the right to match the large black dog by gathering their collective power.

“We suppress him together.” The Imperial Void Celestial King moved, blasting out at the lightning giant.

It was not that he wanted to help the large black dog, but rather that they definitely had to get rid of this lightning giant first if they wanted to close down this great formation. He was only helping himself.

He Runhai moved as well. With the combined forces of three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, their battle prowess was extremely terrifying.

But the lightning giant had completely no knowledge of pain, nor any fear of death. Every attack he delivered was a full-on, forceful confrontation, showing how extremely domineering he was.

This caused even the three great Celestial Kings to become significantly wounded, but also caused the death of the lightning giant to come faster and faster. His figure became smaller and smaller, and finally turned into multiple spheres of lightning, which exploded completely.

Everyone hurriedly rubbed some blood on the stone tablet, and the lightning that filled the air instantly disappeared. This area was also resolved. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Friend He, just how many more unexpected surprises are there?” the Imperial Void Celestial King asked.

“Er… I really have no idea, either.” He Runhai shook his head. Too much time had passed, so it would not be strange no matter what strange changes had taken place here.

“I’ll stay behind,” Luo Yangqiu said. He sat beside the stone tablet.

Everyone set out once again, heading towards the next area.

This was an area of lush and verdant forest. There were tall trees and jade-green grass, but there definitely was not a single animal. There weren’t even any insects. The vicinity was clearly filled with life and vitality, yet at the same time seemed like a haunted land.

Without exception, whether it was trees or grass, they had all born fruits. There were red fruits, green, and purple, fruits of all colors, presenting a very dazzling scene.

“These fruits would explode, and have very terrifying power,” He Runhai warned.

If even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King said that they had very terrifying power, they definitely could not be underestimated.

“Then we can only fly,” the Imperial Void Celestial King said. There were plants everywhere in this area, and all the plants were bearing fruits. Thus, if they wanted to forge on from ground level, they would definitely detonate countless fruits.

They all soared in midair, entering into this area.

But the Regulations here were strange. The moment they entered, they caused a ripple in the air, and this ripple became stronger and stronger, causing the plants to begin swaying.

Pa, pa, pa.?One after another, fruits fell and then shot towards Ling Han and the others like arrows.

In just an instant, the whole sky was filled with flying fruits.

Everyone moved, wanting to send these fruits flying away from them. But their power had just barely touched these fruits, and it instantly caused these fruits to explode.?Boom, once the fruits in front exploded, it immediately caused a chain reaction.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The sound of explosions was endless, and by the end of it, they could no longer distinguish it, as they felt their ears ring from the cacophony of booms.

The explosive power of every single fruit was around the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier. This was about the same as the last few areas, but having thousands of them explode at the same time, this power was too terrifying, and even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings bore injuries.
