Chapter 1065: Nine Flames Heavenly King

The whole altar was embroiled in chaos.

One after another, powerful Demonic Beasts charged out. One after another, cultivators showed their divine might. They had been imprisoned, about to be sacrificed, but now they could see a hope for survival—worse came to worst, even if they did not manage to make it out alive, they would bring down as many enemies with them as they could. At least, they could not allow themselves to die in such a powerless manner.

Hence, these prisoners became like a fierce tiger that had just been released from its cage, baring its sharp fangs and completely unleashing its violent and murderous nature.

“Brat, it’s you!” A guard finally caught Ling Han and the small dog destroying the prison cells red-handed, and shouted in a towering rage. They were foiling the plans of His Imperial Majesty, and he would be held responsible for this failure.

“Die!” He charged over, and delivered a palm strike. It was like a mountain was bearing down. The hit had not yet landed, but Ling Han already felt like he was about to be flattened by that terrifying weight.

The Sun Moon Tier!

He could not take him head on, he thought. Grabbing the small dog, he ducked into the Black Tower in a flash.

Bang, the palm strike hit, yet did not manage to land on anything.

“What?!” the guard exclaimed in spite of himself. He was the chief of this place, and could be called the prison warden. He was responsible for all the sacrifices, yet the main culprit actually disappeared into thin air. How was he going to explain this to the Eternity Sky Emperor later on?

This was a task that His Imperial Majesty had personally commanded him to do.

When he thought of this, he shuddered involuntarily, breaking out in a cold sweat.

Even if he was in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, so what? In front of an ultimate elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, he was a mere ant, what more when the Eternity Sky Emperor was a supreme elite at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. One glare was enough to kill him a few hundred times over.

In the Black Tower, the Asura Demon Emperor stared at the small dog, a very unfriendly expression on his face.

This was too despicable. It was actually a dog as well; wasn’t it planning to snatch business from him?

The small dog, meanwhile, acted very tsundere, and ignored the Asura Demon Emperor completely. It merely looked around the environment in the Black Tower curiously, a clearly stunned expression on his face.

Whoever entered into the Black Tower would be astounded at first.

The Asura Demon Emperor could not help but ask, “Master, is this dumb dog your new pet?”

“No.” Ling Han shook his head. “He is just temporarily staying here for a while, and will soon leave.”

Only now did the Asura Demon Emperor feel relieved, and was no longer worried that someone else would take over his job.

They waited in the Black Tower, but that guard did not leave all this while, seemingly sure that Ling Han had used some kind of means to hide in the darkness. He thought he just hadn’t managed to find him yet.

A major rebellion was taking place inside the altar. The prisoners that Ling Han had released numbered in the thousands, and were practically all in the Mountain River Tier. Combined together, they were a very powerful force. Who would have thought that these prisoners who had had their cultivation restricted could still somehow stage a rebellion?

The defenses here were completely insufficient. Suddenly, their defenses were broken through, and they proceeded forcefully.

Weng!

But just at this moment, a frightening aura rolled out in waves. Everyone was pressed against the ground by this aura. Even if Ling Han was inside the Black Tower, he still felt a lingering fear in his heart.

An elite had come!

A while later, a tall man walked out from the tunnel. A black cloak was wrapped around him, and it fluttered slightly even without any breeze. There were also nine flames jumping around behind him, and they formed a circle behind his back.

Each flame was filled with intimidating power. Even a Sun Moon Tier cultivator would be filled with endless fear upon a single look. The moment they were touched just in the slightest by these flames, they would instantly be incinerated and turn to ashes.

This was an elite in the Heavenly Body Tier!

Indeed, this place was much too important—there was actually an elite in the Heavenly Body Tier standing guard in the vicinity. The moment he had discovered a rebellion occurring in the altar, he rushed over to suppress it.

In the face of such an elite, even if there was more than 10,000 Mountain River Tier cultivators, what would be the use? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A single look and a flare of his aura would completely suppress them. The gap between the two was too large to be described with mere words.

“Respects to the King!” The few remaining guards knelt, and reverently paid their respects.

‘King?’

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. There were not many Kings in the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, but rather only one, and he was the actual brother to the Eternity Sky Emperor. He was known by the name “Nine Flames Heavenly King”, and it was rumored that his cultivation level had reached the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier.

The Nine Flames Heavenly King really did his name justice. There were nine divine flames flickering behind him—this was his strongest killing move.

Hiss, even the brother to the Eternity Sky Emperor was standing guard here, which was a proof of the great importance the Eternity Sky Emperor attached to this place.

With a casual wave of the Nine Flames Heavenly King’s hand, cultivators and Demonic Beasts alike were tossed into the air. Then, they were blasted to death. Blood rained, and their vitality and life energy were all absorbed by the altar, feeding that so-called treasure underground, using their lives to dispel its air of violence.

He was too powerful, and there was absolutely no one that could resist a single wave of his hand. A large amount of life energy and vitality flooded into the altar.

If one was to cultivate here, it would be considered a haven. However, if anyone did something like that, they would definitely become the public enemy of the entire Immortal Realm. This was too deranged!

Hence, forces like the Heaven’s Sword Palace and the five sects would only secretly use the Lower Realm as an alchemist’s furnace. Every ten millennia, they would refine it once, obtaining a few Realm Pills. It was an extremely nutritious item, and was effective even for the Genesis Tier, though the effects might be limited.

Under the suppressive aura of the Heavenly Body Tier, the living creatures in this place were incapable of even releasing a yell before they were killed one after another, and then sacrificed.

“His Imperial Majesty’s plans must not be disrupted by anyone!” The Nine Flames Heavenly King uttered lowly. Though his voice was not loud, it echoed into each and every corner, so everyone could hear it loud and clear.

“Yes, my lord!” the guards replied respectfully once more.

“Now tell me, why have the prisoners here fled?” the Nine Flames Heavenly King asked coldly. These people had all had their cultivation sealed. They were all merely in the Mountain River Tier, so with their own abilities, they could not possibly remove their restrictions by themselves even if they spent their entire lives trying to!

“This...” The guards all hummed quietly. They couldn’t really explain why, either.

“Are you all trash?” The Nine Flames Heavenly King flew into a towering rage. Such a rebellion had already taken place, yet these people actually didn’t even know what was going on!

“My, My Lord, I have deduced one possibility.” A guard ran over—it was the prison warden.

“Speak!”

“Yes! Yes!” The prison warden quickly recounted his previous encounter with Ling Han.

The Nine Flames Heavenly King casually grabbed a prisoner, and struck him dead. Then, he read the prisoner’s soul. Because the event had only happened just a while ago, and he only needed to find out the cause, he soon found out the scene of Ling Han setting the prisoners free.

He tossed the prisoner into the blood lake, then grabbed another prisoner, and read his soul as well. One, two, three, and the memories he glimpsed were all the same.

‘Who is this man?’ The Nine Flames Heavenly King was shocked. From the memories of these people, he knew that the man that had set the prisoners free was only in the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier. How could he have possibly been able to release the restrictions on the others?

Furthermore, there was a hole in their memory at the most crucial point. When their memories reappeared, their cultivation level had recovered suddenly.

Strange, extremely strange!

‘Suddenly disappeared? Could it be... a Spatial God Tool!’ An expression of shock showed on his face. Others could not possibly think of that immediately, but elites of the Heavenly Body Tier were very knowledgeable, and that was naturally not something ordinary people could match.
