Chapter 2469: Yielding

Ling Han did not tell Little Terror to pursue them. They had no great grudge between them, and their conflict was merely for the sake of contending for a tower, so there was no need to fight over it to death.

He cast out all the subordinates of the other two Celestial Kings, and then conducted a thorough search.

“Yi, why does this seem like a precious tool?”

After a very long while, Ling Han came to a conclusion—he had discovered a structure that was akin to the core of a precious tool inside the tower, and a spiritual mark could be engraved on it, making it into “your own.”

However, the spiritual mark of another was presently left here.

It should belong to the Ninth Descent Celestial King.

Ling Han dared not be careless. Though he was very strong, he had not become a Celestial King yet, after all. A Third Heaven Celestial King was still too strong for him, and he cautiously touched the spiritual mark.

Boom, an ancient, aged intent immediately rushed towards him, turning into a gray-robed man inside Ling Han’s mind. He was just in his twenties, and looked dashingly handsome, but age and maturity that came from seeing through the world of mortals seeped from his eyes.

The Ninth Descent Celestial King!

Ling Han smiled faintly, clasped his hands, and greeted, “Greetings, Lord Ninth Descent.”

The Ninth Descent Celestial King also smiled. “Since I have manifested in your mind, it means that you have already occupied this base.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han nodded. “That’s right.”

“However, it is one matter for you to conquer this base, but a completely another matter to see if you can take possession of it,” the Ninth Descent Celestial King declared proudly. “Though I am only a sliver of divine sense, you are but a First Heaven yourself— yi, you have not advanced into the Celestial King Tier!”

......

He saw how there was a Celestial Seed that had not taken form yet in Ling Han’s mind. Its existence meant only one thing, and that was Ling Han had not broken through to the Celestial King Tier yet.

The Ninth Descent Celestial King was extremely shocked. He could clearly feel that Ling Han’s divine sense was incredibly strong, and had definitely crossed over the threshold of the Celestial King Tier, but Ling Han himself had not broken through to the Celestial King Tier yet. There was an extreme strangeness about this.

What in the world was going on?

Ling Han asked seriously, “If Lord Ninth Descent is willing to part with it, and disperse this sliver of divine sense on your own volition, then I would owe milord a favor. How about it?”

If a Pseudo-Celestial King actually dared pose such a question to a Third Heaven Celestial King, it would practically make others laugh themselves to death, but the Ninth Descent Celestial King did not feel the slightest bit amused. Instead, he was seriously considering the matter.

After a while, he suddenly smiled. “All right, I will gift this base to you! However, I also hope that you don’t invade one of my other bases next time.”

As he saw it, though Ling Han’s present battle prowess was below his notice, he was a man of great ambition, and was not satisfied with such a small place like the Celestial Path. He wanted to obtain a great opportunity, and make his way into the Celestial Realm. In that case, just how frightening could someone who had not yet attained Celestial King Tier but already possessed the battle prowess of a Celestial King be?

Ling Han’s future accomplishments were definitely boundless. After weighing the pros and cons, he was willing to use a base to trade for a favor from Ling Han.

Xiu, this sliver of his divine sense immediately departed, shooting towards the heart of the ruins.

This Celestial King was really quite interesting, Ling Han smiled.

If the Ninth Descent Celestial King was not willing to yield, Ling Han would not fear a battle, either. After all, the other was only a sliver of divine sense, so just how inconceivably strong could it be?

Ling Han imprinted his own divine sense on this tower. When he had left behind a sliver of divine sense, he suddenly felt that he seemed to have gained a connection with this tower, allowing him to obtain a considerable amount of information.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han shockingly discovered that the Black Tower, which had been in slumber all this while, suddenly shook slightly, but immediately, no further movement could be detected.

Strange!

Was this the Black Tower just waking up for a short while in the midst of slumber, or was it because he had taken possession of this tower? Otherwise, this was really too coincidental.

But he had only taken ownership of a tower, so why would it cause a reaction from the Black Tower? Though it was an incredibly weak reaction.

Never mind for now.

Ling Han spoke to the three women. Later, when midnight came, a bizarre phenomenon would occur, and if they cultivated at that time, the effects would be greatly increased.

The midnight here referred to the shift of day and night of the Celestial Path. Hence, this kind of change would only take place once every three days in actuality.

They were only 18 hours away from midnight, and had to wait patiently.

When the time came, a streak of light shot out from the top of the tower, ignoring all the levels of obstruction, and penetrating all the way through to the first floor.

At the same time, a peculiar fragrance was also wafting in the air, causing one to feel like they were about to sprout wings and fly.

Ling Han and the others all extracted the light, smelling the fragrance, and suddenly felt the Celestial Seed in their bodies was rapidly growing.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s Celestial Seed Mark had already sprouted and grown. Thus, this was most helpful for her. Her cultivation level was rapidly increasing, and because their Celestial Seed Marks had not formed yet, the assistance it provided for Ling Han and the others was far below the one Bewitching Maiden Rou enjoyed, though there was ultimately some help. They could only decide to immediately advance into the Celestial King Tier if they wanted more.

Only Little Terror did not get the slightest bit of benefit. It belonged to an alternative cultivation system. Even if Wally had done some modifications for it, it did not form any Celestial Seed while breaking through to the Celestial King Tier, so there was naturally no way for it to benefit further.

This kind of benefit did not last very long. After around 30 minutes had passed, the light suddenly disappeared, and the peculiar fragrance was also swiftly dispersing, and could no longer be smelled.

“Are we going to continue charging ahead?” the Empress asked.

The deeper in, the greater the benefits of this tower, but there would also be more towers, and they, too, could generate some amazing benefits.

But there were only four of them, so what could they do even if they conquered another tower? Without adequate manpower, there was no way for them to keep it in their possession. If they were concerned for the front, they would not be able to concern themselves with the rear.

No wonder the Ninth Descent Celestial King had previously sent people to recruit passersby. After all, there were only a few people with Celestial King Tier battle prowess, and they were in dire need of replenishment.

“Should we also recruit some helpers?”

Ling Han and the others decided to wait for another while longer. With their present battle prowess, they were still not strong enough to contend with Third Heaven Celestial Kings, so even if they went into the heart of the ruins, it would be completely useless as well because that was above their pay grade.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. They had obtained the benefits of the peculiar light and peculiar fragrance five times, causing Ling Han and the others to rapidly complete their Celestial Seed Mark. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was advancing strongly towards the middle stage of the First Heaven.

Initially, this process would take a few hundred million or even billion years, but who asked Bewitching Maiden Rou to cultivate a Time Celestial Physique? Others could only cultivate for a while, yet she could have a time extension of over 100 times. How could this be compared?

Another few days later, Ling Han shockingly discovered that there were presently five people coming together.

Five Celestial Kings!

Had the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King been displeased with the failure of his first invasion, and had thus sent five Celestial Kings in a second attempt? However, even four Celestial Kings working together had been driven into a tizzy by Little Terror, so what was the use of having an additional Celestial King?

When these five people had come a bit closer, Ling Han couldn’t help but be surprised, because he recognized all five of them.

Yi, Yan Xianlu, Cheng Zixin, He Xinjue, and Fu Zhou, they were all members of the alliance.

Ling Han laughed, and leaped out.

“Brother Ling!” When Yi and the others spotted Ling Han, they couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, filled with pleasant surprise.

“Come, come, come, come in quickly,” Ling Han beckoned them inside. There were restraints of the purple light outside, which would cause a massive drop in battle prowess. Only the towers here were capable of resisting this kind of pressure.

The group entered into the tower, and spoke of their respective experiences. They were all filled with danger, especially in the case of Yan Xianlu, who had been targeted and almost captured by seven great Celestial Kings Yu Wudi had been part of.

“Brother Ling, you didn’t fall for it, did you?” Yan Xianlu asked. When Yu Wudi and his group had attacked him, they had spoken a few scattered words about planning to use him as a trap against Ling Han
