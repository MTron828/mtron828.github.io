Chapter 2456: Summoning Clouds City

This was a big boss.

Hui was expressionless, as cold as ice.

Ling Han smiled. “There were so many of them, so why must you follow me?”

Hui glanced at him emotionlessly. “You are a very intriguing person. You are the first person to successfully threaten me. Furthermore, I am very curious about the reason why you can use such great power.”

“You want to know? Fine, I’ll tell you.” Ling Han generously took out Wally’s model theory, and even provided the detailed formula. In any case, there was no one that could learn it at present aside from him.

True enough, Hui was extremely dazed. At the beginning, he was still pondering, but very soon, he collapsed, and turned into his real form of a giant carrot, endless roots waving around.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han pulled the three women with him, and escaped quickly.

He had no wish to stay with a terrifying guy like Hui. Though the latter had not advanced into the Celestial King Tier, either—otherwise, why would he need a flawless Celestial Seed—this guy was really terrifying with his special form under specific conditions.

It was best to keep their distance.

The four of them set out, and continued their quest for Celestial Seeds. Their final destination was naturally the heart of the Celestial Path. Only after becoming a Celestial King would they be able to directly leave from there.

...

This mainland after their marine trip was extremely dangerous, with various poisonous swamps, valleys filled with Sword Qi, and mountains with soaring saber intent. Every location could not be barged in rashly, or the only result would be death.

...They had probably reached the level of Second Heaven, or even Third Heaven Celestial King Tier. For Pseudo-Celestial Kings like them, they were all places of danger, death and demise.

However, it was not that those danger zones could not traversed through. That would have to depend on the date. Perhaps there were just a few hours in a whole month when they would be safe, and one could pass through. Perhaps it would be alternate days. The time was extremely short.

Ling Han and the others naturally slowed down. There were some danger zones that would only have a change once every few years. They had to be extremely patient. At times, they had to stay for a longer time. Otherwise, if any unexpected changes took place, it would be too late for regret. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This was not them being too cautious, but rather that they had encountered this situation before. They had clearly seen a change take place in their environment, and it could be traversed, but it only lasted for one or two breaths at most before returning back to being extremely frightening, with killing intent around every corner.

Though this kind of falsely safe situation did not appear too frequently, it just needed to happen once, and they would have to take careful notice because no one could guarantee the danger zone that they were about to pass through was not in a state of false safety.

In this fashion, their progress naturally became overwhelmingly slow. Over 1,000 years had passed, and they were still very far away from the heart of the Celestial Path.

No wonder the Celestial Path would be open for as long as 10,000 years. If they had to walk all the way to the heart, the time taken was indeed very long.

Ling Han and the others had naturally grasped the Celestial Seed Marks that Hui had bestowed on them, allowing them to grasp slightly Hui’s Dao.

It was more inclined towards Slaughter, and was also close to Death, which was very bizarre.

And it was also because of this that they had spent a good few centuries before finally grasping this Celestial Seed Mark. However, none of them wanted to use this as their own Celestial Seed, even if the overall level of this Celestial Seed was higher.

If they used it to break through to the Celestial King Tier, their whole person would become a killing machine, cold and emotionless.

It could only be used for reference.

The four were also continuously absorbing Celestial Seeds, comprehending them one after another, and extracting the essence within to increase their own understanding of Dao.

Ling Han had told the three women before that he had had great ambitions. He would take the strengths of thousands of Celestial Seeds, and form a Celestial Seed that belonged uniquely to him alone.

He did not want any Celestial Seed that already existed, because in his eyes, any Celestial Seed that already existed would naturally bear the mark of another, even if this other was actually the heaven and earth.

His own Dao should be unique and solely his.

The Empress and Hu Niu both decided to do the same. They would collect all kinds of Celestial Seeds and gather their strength together to form a Celestial Seed that suited them the most. Bewitching Maiden Rou did not have such grand ambitions. Now, she would already have no regrets if she could break through to the Celestial King Tier.

The more Celestial Seed Marks there were, the deeper Ling Han’s appreciation became. It was like the heaven and earth had also appeared in front of him in the form of these marks. He would be able to grasp Regulations with a simple movement, and nothing was impossible for him.

This kind of feeling was very amazing, making him gain an urge to hurriedly break through to the Celestial King Tier.

He hurriedly repressed this kind of urge. If he broke through now, it would not be perfect enough.

The four of them continued on their way. Sometimes, they would not be walking in a straight line, but would rather detour to other places. As long as there was a Celestial Seed, they would make their move. This was their purpose in coming to the Celestial Path.

The number of Celestial King Pills in Ling Han’s possession increased further and further. Not only was there one for each of his wives and parents, even his friends could each have claim to one.

This was something they could not have imagined before they set out—that things would actually progress so smoothly.

Time sped by swiftly. Another 7000 years passed, and only less than 2000 years were left until the deadline of 10,000 years. Ling Han and the others made some adjustments, and did not roam any further. Instead, they headed directly for the central area of the Celestial Path.

They could not possibly make the cut off period with too little time to spare, or they could really be trapped here for eternity.

The celestial fruits Ling Han had obtained numbered in the hundreds. The mark that each of them had formed appeared in his mind. He had a kind of feeling that even if it was that so-called flawless Celestial Seed, so what? He had not intended to break through with that Celestial Seed, either. At most, he would only study it.

In fact, he had a feeling that even if he broke through now, the Celestial Seed he formed would not be inferior to a flawless Celestial Seed.

Of course, with no immediate reason, he was in no rush to break through, either.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou1 were slightly inferior. They still had to accumulate some more.

On this day, they arrived in a city, and made some queries to find out just how far they were from the heart of the Celestial Path.

This city was called Summoning Clouds City, and had a Celestial King as overseer. Naturally, the Celestial King was named Summoning Clouds Celestial King. This city had been named after his title in the first place.

The Summoning Clouds Celestial King was very powerful. He was a Third Heaven Celestial King, and could definitely be considered a supreme elite on the Celestial Path.

However, it was rumored that this Celestial King was presently not within the city, but no one knew where exactly he had gone, nor did anyone dare to ask. In any case, no one dared to cause trouble. Otherwise, if a Celestial King was truly enraged, wouldn’t that just be seeking death?

Ling Han and the others entered into the city to find out the details of their present situation.

“Do you guys know where Lord Summoning Clouds has gone?” In the restaurant, there were people constantly discussing spiritedly, passing judgment on everything. At times, they really would reveal some real secrets.

“How could we possibly know!”

“That’s right. Wherever Lord Summoning Clouds has gone, how could it be that he would have to tell us first?”

The customer from before laughed loudly. “Let me tell you guys. I have a relative that is the son of a distant third uncle of the youngest disciple of the Summoning Clouds Celestial King. He has told me himself that Lord Summoning Clouds has gone to fight a war!”

“What, Lord Summoning Clouds is already so strong, and there is still someone that dares to become his enemy?” someone asked disbelievingly.

“That’s right. You must be grandstanding!”

“This is completely unbelievable.”

The customer from before spoke with an assured tone as he patted his chest and declared, “I can swear on my life that every word I say is true.”

“Then tell us, whom has Lord Summoning Clouds gone to war with?”

“I do not know.” The customer from before shook his head.

“Tsk!” Everyone shook their heads. This could not hold up to questioning at all; immediately, the cat was let out of the bag.

“It’s true,” the customer from before hurriedly exclaimed. “Though I do not know whom Lord Summoning Clouds has gone to war with, it is rumored that Lord Qiyuan has muttered this before. It involves the method to leave the Celestial Path.”
