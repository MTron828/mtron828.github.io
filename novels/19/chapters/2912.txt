2913 Decapitation

Ling Han sent out his divine sense like tentacles, and carefully examined the surroundings.

Very soon, a smile appeared on his face.

It was actually very easy to differentiate whether the creatures had intelligence or not. A monster that did not have intelligence would also exude an incredibly frenzied aura. It only had the thought of slaughter, but if it had intelligence, it would not be so frenzied.

Very soon, Ling Han locked onto a target, and then locked onto the second, the third, and so on.

He shared the intel about these targets with Fu Yuan, and then said, “Brother Fu, do you think we can still break through the siege after committing murder?”

“Of course!” Fu Yuan appeared to be filled with confidence.

“All right, you take care of those two, and I will deal with the three on this side.” Ling Han assigned the targets. “If the task cannot be completed, retreat immediately.”

Fu Yuan nodded.

The two of them moved quietly. This was a little ridiculous. They were clearly in the midst of the army, so how could they move quietly? But this army was presently lying in a dormant state. Every single monster was like a stone statue, and as long as the duo did not release any waves of power, it was as if they were invisible.

The two each arrived near a specific target, and then suddenly moved.

Weng, Ling Han directly channeled the first-grade seal, and when he shot out a punch, it was extremely domineering.

The target immediately came to its senses. This was a human-shaped monster, but had three arms. Instantly, all three arms waved at the same time, and struck out at Ling Han.

It had the battle prowess of a late-stage Fifth Tier. Not only was the power of its three arms domineering, a sinister spiritual attack also struck at the same time.

Ling Han was slightly surprised because the troops of Hysteria that he had previously come into contact with had not been versed in spiritual attacks at all.

It was probably the simplest to directly bestow power on one’s subordinates. Otherwise, there was no way that Hysteria would prevent its subordinates from becoming stronger.

Peng!

As he thought this, Ling Han’s punch didn’t stop at all, forcibly shattering the three arms of the selected monster. With the addition of the first-grade seal, his battle prowess was too strong.

The surging spiritual attack was ground into nothing by the Powers of Dimension in his body. Ling Han’s fist was unstoppable, and as the attack landed, the target was instantly blown up.

The sudden assault, added with the crushing advantage in strength, caused this monster to be unable to block even a single move from Ling Han.

On the other side, though Fu Yuan had also launched a sneak attack, his strength was inferior to Ling Han’s. Being hit by a spiritual attack, he immediately showed an expression of pain. Even a Heavenly Venerate would be slightly affected by this kind of attack.

Boom, the army that had initially been dead silent suddenly rioted. All the monsters opened their eyes at the same time, their murderous aura soaring into the skies.

They set their aim on Ling Han and Fu Yuan, and then attacked madly.

Peng, peng, peng! One after another, attacks assailed them. There were Fifth Tier, Fourth Tier, Third Tier, Second Tier, First Tier, and even some Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier attacks, and all them blasted towards Ling Han and Fu Yuan.

Ling Han hurriedly ducked, using the bodies of the monsters as his cover.

Every single one of Hysteria’s creations was extremely huge. Though Ling Han was surrounded, he was actually also protected. Attacks from afar could not reach him at all, and would be blocked by these monsters that were nearer to him.

These monsters were ferocious, and did not even care that their own companions were standing in front of them. They just continued to attack madly.

Without intelligence, that was how it was.

Ling Han took advantage of the chaos to make a move. He then charged towards the second target. The first-grade seal showed its might, and he was unstoppable. Peng, peng, peng! The monsters that stood in front of him were no match for him at all, and were blasted into dust by him.

“Zhi…” A considerable number of monsters flew up, releasing a strange, ear-piercing screech.

All of a sudden, all the monsters no longer attacked blindly. The monsters that were in front of them stepped back one after another, freeing up space so that the army behind them could fire attacks simultaneously. In a single round, there would be several thousand strikes attacking them at the same time.

Those few naturally were intelligent monsters.

Ling Han saw this clearly. It was good that these guys had exposed themselves. They were locked on by his divine sense, and could no longer hide themselves.

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han was being attacked madly, but the millions and millions of cells in his body channeled their power, turning into millstones, and crushing the attacks that assaulted him. There was actually a portion that was still absorbed by him, and turned into something akin to supplies for him.

Of course, there were also some attacks that were too powerful, and could not be crushed. They still caused some damage to him, but the threat they posed was much smaller, and only caused him slight pain.

Ling Han laughed loudly. His Powers of Dimension continued to grow, and they actually had such an effect?

However, upon further thought, this wasn’t strange. The accommodating ability of dimensions was extremely strong. For example, the Flaming Frost Realm could completely withstand a great battle between elites of the Sixth Tier, at least.

When there came a day the Powers of Dimension in Ling Han’s body reached the level of Great Accomplishment, he himself would be a Genesis World. What power would be able to crush him?

There was definitely none!

Of course, the arrival of this day was boundlessly far ahead in the future, and who knew how long he would need to cultivate for.

Ling Han bravely forged onwards, and began a massacre.

However, the Hysteria army was madly filling up the holes that he had created, all of them completely putting their lives on the line, and hindering Ling Han’s progress even if he was so incomparably fierce.

He was clearly only 50 km away from a target, and originally it had only been a matter of taking a step, yet now it seemed to have become an endless distance. No matter how hard he tried, he could not reach it.

That target was a lupine monster, but it was standing on its hind legs. A cold smirk appeared at the corners of its lips, and it sent out a message through divine sense, saying, “I am very impressed that the two of you dare to charge here, but this is only courting death.”

“That may not be the case,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Your fate has already been decided, the Flaming Frost Realm’s fate has already been decided, and Genesis World’s fate has already been decided as well,” the wolf-shaped monster said in a disdainful tone. “Master’s brilliance will ultimately devour everything.”

“I say, since you have already developed intelligence, why do you still have to work for Hysteria?” Ling Han began to drive a wedge between the monster and its master. “You naturally know that your final fate will be either to die on the battlefield, or to be swallowed by Hysteria after you succeed, and you will no longer be you. Is this what you want?”

This kind of intelligent creation was unlike Meng Dong and the others. They were created from Hysteria having split out a part of itself, so they were unafraid of death, and regarded it as their return to the main body.

The wolfish monster remained silent, but it merely did not choose to argue with Ling Han. On the sidelines, it commanded with its divine sense, mobilizing the army to launch a mad offensive against Ling Han and Fu Yuan.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and all the ninth-grade seals in his body were channeled. His power increased explosively again. Peng, peng, peng! One punch after another blasted out, and no one could withstand them.

Like a bolt of lightning, Ling Han charged toward the lupine monster, and no one could stop him.

The wolfish monster had not thought that Ling Han would be so powerful. It hurriedly wanted to retreat, but how could it manage to do so in time? In an instant, it was killed by Ling Han.

However, there were definitely not just two leader monsters here. Though the death of two of them had caused some chaos in the army of monsters, new leaders appeared to command their troops. Furthermore, they themselves had hidden far away, and did not involve themselves in any danger. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In this way, it would become extremely and extraordinarily difficult for Ling Han to kill another leader monster.

He swept his gaze around, and saw that Fu Yuan had already fallen into desperate straits. By the looks of it, he would definitely not be able to last more than 10 breaths’ time.
