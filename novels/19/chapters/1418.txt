Chapter 1419 So What If I Become a Demon?

even ling han was slightly apprehensive of the wooden sword in his hands. if a demon master truly leaped out from this wooden sword, that would certainly bring them heaps more joy and fun.

right now, however, he didn’t have time to worry about this. heaven was great and earth was great, but what could be greater and more important than his wife?

‘charge!’

ling han activated the star plucking step, his lightning sword technique also allowing his attacks to be as quick as flashes of lightning. coupled with the wooden sword’s incredible destructive ability, he was much like a machine of death at this moment.

blood and flesh flew through the air.

everyone here was at the heavenly body tier, yet none of them were able to stop ling han’s advance. the 19 elites at the high extreme of the heavenly body tier were relentlessly and wantonly killed by ling han, 11 of them dying in just a few hours’ time.

this battle could definitely be recorded in the history books of joint peace planet. this was the bloodiest battle that this planet had seen in at least the past one billion years. close to a dozen heavenly body tier elites had already perished in this battle.

although there were still seven elites at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier, they found it impossible to stop ling han after having their power suppressed by two stars.

more importantly, ling han’s attacks were far too quick, lightning-like as they struck. in addition, they couldn’t determine whom ling han would attack beforehand, causing everyone to become worried about their own safety. when ling han launched his attacks, it would more so already be too late for the others to provide aid to his victim. the targets of his attacks would only have themselves to rely on.

at this moment, could elites at the high extreme still challenge ling han’s might? no way!

“damn it!” the expressions of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor changed drastically. apart from them, was no else able to contain ling han?

“attack that mountain!” the jade drop emperor suddenly commanded.

‘that’s right!’

ling han clearly hadn’t needed to face the emperors’ attacks head-on at the beginning, yet he had chosen to do so and receive wounds rather than crash into the stone door on the mountain.

that was his weak point!

with this in mind, the elites immediately understood what they had to do. they all turned their attention to the small mountain, unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks toward it.

ling han’s killing intent grew even stronger. affected by the wooden sword in his hand, his eyes more so became crimson, his black hair billowing toward the sky. his clothes also exploded into pieces, revealing his toned and stone-like muscles.

he had refined the essence of a demon master before, and now due to the effects of the demonic sword, it was as if he were transforming into a demon. veins of black divine patterns materialized on his skin, all of them radiating with a sinister aura.

“netherworld being!”

even though there was no two realm passageway here, the elites still recognized this at first glance. this was mainly because the netherworld gave the immortal realm far too much pressure. thus, even beings—higher-ups, at least—in a peaceful region such as this were aware of their existence.

“this young man... is transforming into a demon!”

“kill him! everyone is responsible for killing sinister demons from the netherworld!”

“humph! since he’s becoming a demon, he’ll definitely be discriminated by the heaven and earth of the immortal realm, rendering him unable to wield the power of regulations. once this power is stripped from him, perhaps he’ll become weaker than even ordinary elites at the medium extreme of the heavenly body tier!”

the elites were delighted upon hearing this. ling han transforming into a demon at this moment was equivalent to him severing his own arms.

“so what if i become a demon?” ling han roared with a hearty laugh. demonic patterns appeared in his eyes and gradually covered his entire face. at this moment, it was as if a demon master had taken over his body, causing his aura to far transcend that of ordinary heavenly body tier elites.

it was a pity that this aura was the same as the notionless saint’s aura—powerful in appearance but weak in reality.

ling han laughed wildly, and roared, “you dare to harm my wife? even if i transform into a sinister demon of death, i’ll still crawl out of the abyss to slaughter you all!”

boom!

the wooden sword suddenly combusted. no, it wasn’t combusting. rather, it was releasing flames from its body!

these were black flames—flames of death!

boom!

ling han slashed with the wooden sword, sending bursts of deathly flames into the surroundings. an elite at the low extreme of the heavenly body tier was spectating this battle from the distance, yet he was unable to dodge these flames in time. a wisp of deathly flame burst toward him, giving him a huge fright. he frantically slapped toward it, attempting to extinguish it in its path.

however, he was shocked to discover that... this flame couldn’t be extinguished! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

not only that, but it even caused his body to self-combust. moreover, it was his life force that was self-combusting!

one’s life force was the very essence of their being. if one’s life force was drained, their lifespan would be severed. if they had an original lifespan of 10,000 years, this might drop to 1000 years, 100 years, or even just a few days.

the elite was completely petrified. he didn’t want to die!

the person next to him instantly rushed over to help. this was an elite at the medium extreme of the heavenly body tier. however, the result was... he also started to self-combust...

‘f*ck! these flames of death are contagious?’

everyone was overtaken by apprehension.

the two affected elites tried to seek help from others, yet the other elites all avoided them as if they were the plague.

“your majesty!” the two elites turned their pleading eyes to the eternity sky emperor. they were both elites from the eternity sky majestic empire.

the eternity sky emperor immediately stopped his skirmish with the jade drop emperor and made a pressing motion toward the two elites.

boom!

a terrifying power burst forth, suppressing the flames of death. however, this power didn’t extinguish the flames.

the eternity sky emperor’s expression changed slightly. there was a hint of apprehension on his face.

from this, it could be deduced that he possessed the power to resist the invasion of the flames of death. however, he would need to defend with his full power. otherwise, he would risk allowing the flames of death to spread. once the flames of death reached him, it would snowball into an even bigger problem, giving him more and more trouble. at that time, he would have no choice but to resist the flames day and night, without any time to rest.

sure enough, he couldn’t underestimate that brat. he had gained possession of a new technique.

“brother chang, it’s best that we kill that brat first!” the jade drop emperor suggested. he had finally reached a strong resolve. right now, he felt that ling han was the biggest threat to their goal. in fact, he was even more dangerous than the eternity sky emperor. as such, they had to dispose of him as soon as possible.

“agreed!” the eternity sky emperor responded with a nod.

both of them were rulers of a majestic empire, so it was only natural that they possessed incredibly strong resolve. once they put their mind to something, nothing would be able to waver them. they both charged toward ling han.

weng!

ling han unleashed heaven’s might, causing the power of the two emperors to drop drastically.

as long as ling han’s opponents weren’t one major tier above him, they would definitely be affected by the power of heaven’s might. of course, if one’s battle prowess were strong enough, they would be able to resist this power for a certain amount of time. for example, during the battle between prodigies, the 10-star geniuses had all possessed techniques to oppose the power of heaven’s might.

however... those were 10-star geniuses!

the eternity sky emperor wasn’t a 10-star genius, nor was the jade drop emperor.

“good one, brat!” the two emperors were unable to hide their astonishment. so be it if the divine sword could suppress their power. however, even ling han possessed the ability to suppress their power! this sent a chill down their spines and caused their hair to stand on ends.

if their cultivation levels were the same, would they still be a match for ling han? even four-star geniuses would be suppressed to two-star geniuses!

the two emperors finally didn’t hold back any longer, unleashing all of their most powerful techniques.

they were far too powerful, so they could have one of them hold ling han back while the other prepared a powerful attack. as such, their attacks were all incredibly terrifying. it wasn’t long before ling han was riddled with wounds. in fact, even his indestructible true fluid was unable to completely heal his wounds.

moreover, he only had 10 drops of indestructible true fluid, and their effects would continue to deteriorate if he used them in quick succession. when ling han consumed the last drop of indestructible true fluid, it was as if he had already reached his limit.

“die!” the two emperors attacked in unison, their fire and water techniques surprisingly working in harmony and even unleashing a more devastating might.

the waves of water fused together with the waves of fire, transforming into a formidable column that shot toward ling han’s chest. behind ling han was the stone door. without the power of the nation, it was likely that this stone door would be obliterated by the combined attack of the two emperors.

ling han gritted his teeth as he channeled the indestructible heaven’s scroll with all of his remaining strength, forming a powerful defense.

after reaching great accomplishment, he could block a single strike from a saint. right now, he could definitely block a single strike from an eternal river tier elite.

peng!

ling han crossed his arms before his chest as the column of fire and water slammed into him. he shuddered violently, not only due to the power of the attack, but also due to the regulations of heaven and earth that the two emperors wielded.

however, ling han had managed to block the attack!
