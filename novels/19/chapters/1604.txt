Chapter 1605: The act of violence of a vile character

T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Star Sand Saint’s heart trembled. In truth, it was not that they did not want to allow Ling Han to come out—previously, Ling Han had already said that when the Hu Clan came, he would use his trump card, and exhibit battle prowess that was on the level of peak stage Saint King. He would directly erase all the elites of the Hu Clan.

However, Ling Han very much liked to go into seclusion, and would disappear randomly, so even the Star Sand Saint was very helpless.

At such a key moment, he had again disappeared!

He swept an eye over Cai Miao, and an uncontrollable hatred rose up in his heart. If it was not this the traitorous act of this disciple, how could he be in such a passive situation? He only had to insist that Ling Han was not here, and that was it.

The Star Sand Saint did not know that there existed such a thing like a link of karma.

“Hmm?”

Hu Luo paused slightly. He suddenly managed to grasp the link of karma again. His aged eyes narrowed slightly, and very soon, he saw a figure streak past and arrive. His eyes immediately became slightly bloodshot because this was precisely the “mortal foe” of their Hu Clan.

An Eternal River Tier actually managed to become the mortal foe of a Forbidden Land. This was practically a joke, but the truth was indeed so. Two Saints of the Hu Clan had already died by Ling Han’s hand.

Two Saints!

Even in a Forbidden Land, Saints were not that common. Even the Hu Clan only had 10 Saints. Each and every Saint had been nurtured through an unknown amount of sacrifice and expense. Merely in terms of Saintly medicine, each had consumed no less than three, and the death of every Saint meant a tremendous loss.

Furthermore, Hu Feng had been the future hope of the Hu Clan, and he similarly had died at the hands of this despicable brat.

“Am I late?” Ling Han smiled, his eyes sweeping over the Saints of the Hu Clan on the platform, a similar killing intent flickering in his eyes.

Hu Luo suppressed his killing intent, and said, “Since the leading characters are all here, let’s begin the spar... That’s right, I think this boy is not too bad, so just let him join our Hu Clan and battle on our side.”

“Yes, Grand Elder!” The Saints of the Hu Clan all smiled and nodded.

When Cai Miao heard this, he gritted his teeth, and kowtowed nine times in succession in the direction of Hu Luo. “Thank you for granting me this opportunity, Grand Elder!”

Now, he had truly and completely stood on the opposing side of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, and there was no way out for him.

A public betrayal!

Beneath them, all the disciples were glaring furiously at Cai Miao. Every single person here did not have any positive feelings for the Hu Clan. At the time, Hu Yingmu had been so arrogant, and trampled all over the academy’s pride, yet Cai Miao actually sold himself to the enemy, making everyone want to kill him!

A human being should have his bottom line!

Cai Miao only acted like he did not see them. Since he had already stepped onto this path, he could only follow this path to its end.

Hu Luo couldn’t help but break into a smile, beckoned Cai Miao over, and said, “Come here!” He tapped out a finger, and suddenly a ray of light entered into Cai Miao’s body. “You will be first up.”

At first, Cai Miao was shocked, which was quickly followed by great joy.

He could feel a tremendous strength inside himself, making him feel like he could create a hole in the heaven and earth itself with a single punch.

The Saints of the Hu Clan all smirked coldly. This finger move was called “Divine Shock Finger”, and could fully excite the complete potential that one had. He would gain a massive burst of battle prowess for a short period of time, but he would be completely crippled after the battle.

This kind of trash really thought that he could join the Hu Clan? Tsk!

Yet Cai Miao did not know, and only thought that this was the nature-defying ability of a Saint King causing his battle prowess to soar. He knelt down once more, and said, “Grand Elder, thank you for your favor. I will definitely not disappoint the great hopes you have for me!”

He leaped out, and casually exclaimed, “Who will fight me!”

All the disciples were indignant at the injustice. They really had never seen such a shameless guy!

“I will!” One of the big shot disciples leaped out. He was a king tier of the third campus, and his name was Shi Deng.

“Hahahaha!” Cai Miao did not say another word, and directly shot out a punch. The killing formation inside him activated, and accompanied with the frightening power that he presently had, Shi Deng was actually not his match at all. Peng, he was directly sent flying out of the battle area.

A dead silence fell.

Shi Deng’s limbs were drooping, his whole body covered with blood. He had lost half his life with this single strike, and had already lost consciousness.

“Trash!” Cai Miao spat out. He was really completely happy with his current achievement.

This was the true supreme power that he had always pursued. What a joke. Previously, he had been earnestly cultivating, but he had not imagined that he only needed the gift bestowed from an elite, and he would be able to instantly possess such supreme power.

This was really the smartest and wisest choice that he had made in this lifetime!

“Next!” With his hands crossed behind his back, he acted insufferably arrogant.

“Me!”

“Me!”

“Me!”

All of a sudden, there were actually four big shot disciples that leaped into the tournament grounds at the same time, and Ren Feiyun was one of them.

This was really a vile character getting to power, and becoming conceited and arrogant; no one could bear to watch him flaunting his power, and they felt that killing him with a single strike would be too easy on him. They had to nail him to the pillar at the entrance of the academy so that he would be spurned by the future generations, and serve as a warning for others.

“Let me, the rest of you leave.”

“No, let me!”

The four big shots argued among themselves, all of them wanting to exchange blows with Cai Miao.

“Hehe, you all can fight together!” Cai Miao grinned evilly. He felt that the power inside him was still growing, and reached an inconceivable level. It was obvious that the number of his stars had not increased, but every star had enlarged by more than 10 times, causing his power to soar along with them.

He charged out, and attacked the four big shots at the same time.

Peng, peng, peng. His offensive was too frightening, forcing the four big shots to make their move, but even so, they were still at a disadvantage, and were suppressed by Cai Miao in the battle.

“Hahahaha, I am the true king tier of the younger generation!” Cai Miao laughed loudly. Though he was not able to defeat these four big shots for now, he could feel that the power inside him was still endlessly growing. It would not take too long, and he would be able to overwhelm the four of them with his superior strength.

This was great! This was wonderful!

True enough, after merely over a dozen moves, the four big shots were all sent flying with a single punch from Cai Miao. All of them threw up blood continuously; at least half the bones in their bodies had been broken.

“Next!” Cai Miao was increasingly conceited. His target was Ling Han, but he would not take the initiative to challenge him, because as he saw it, it was he who was in a superior position now, so how could he turn around to challenge a weakling?

He would just be standing here, and whoever came up would just be defeated with a single punch from him.

Seeing how arrogant he was, all the disciples were exploding with fury. When had it been that even a traitor was able to be so arrogant? But even the combined forces of the four big shots were no match for him. The present Cai Miao was really too powerful. Perhaps they would need 10 of them to join forces to be able to suppress him.

But even if they could win with 10 of them working together, what meaning was there to it?

“Is there no one else?” Cai Miao looked down on them, his expression filled with disdain. “Anyone else?”

Everyone clenched their fists tightly in anger, but the present Cai Miao was indeed strong, and they could only watch his arrogant behavior helplessly.

Damn him! Despicable!

Xiu, a figure flashed past, and an extremely graceful, exquisite beauty was standing in the tournament grounds, causing even the sun to lose its shine, and flowers would pale under her beauty.

Empress Luan Xing!

“En?” When they saw the Empress, even the hearts of Hu Luo and the other Saints involuntarily shook, and a desire to possess her rose up in them.

In this aspect, they were far inferior to the Star Sand Saint and the others because the Star Sand Saint and the other Saints were focused on teaching cultivation. They placed a greater importance on the natural talent of their disciples, but Hu Luo and his group were a different story. They had no awareness of being a worthy teacher. Though they were already so old, their desires did not decrease in the slightest.
