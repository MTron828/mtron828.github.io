Chapter 633: Self-Exploding Spirit Tools

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Faced with an authentic Saber Ray, what more when it was a Saber Ray that was formed from a total of 30 flashes of Qi, not even Ling Han dared to take it head on.

Ray was something surpassing Qi, an absolute domination, and the cutting edge that was unbelievably sharp, able to slice apart all in its path.

Even if Ling Han had managed to form the Body of Iron Sheet, he dared not try to take this strike head on. After all, this battle was not a mere spar, but could possibly develop into a full-blown duel to the death.

He smiled calmly, and said, “You have improved, so how could it be that I have not?” Zi, a flash of lightning flickered over his body, and he instantly disappeared from where he had originally been standing at a speed so fast that his movements could not be seen with the naked eye.

An expression of surprise appeared on Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s face; what kind of movement technique was that? How could it be so fast? Before he had made a move, he had already calculated Ling Han’s battle prowess in advance, and he believed that after he had combined his Qi into Ray, he could force Ling Han into a retreat in defeat. Ling Han should not even have the strength to parry his attacks.

But he had never thought that after a mere few months, Ling Han’s movement technique would actually have improved to a whole different level.

Indeed, he was not the only one who had improved.

“It’s more than enough to kill you!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang sneered. He drew his saber and slashed forth. This time, the Saber Ray shone brilliantly, and was as long as 300 meters. It transformed into something that resembled a waterfall, and swept towards Ling Han.

“Is that so?” Ling Han turned into a flash of lightning, and as he used the Demon Fairy Steps, he was as slippery as a fish, moving as nimbly as he liked. Moving his left arm into the form of a bow, his right hand pulled on empty air, and weng, instantly, an arrow formed of Origin Power appeared. It was completely white, but exuded a frightening cold air.

Exterminating Dragon Star Arrow.

“Go!” With a light humph, the arrow of Origin Power shot out. Xiu, in a flash, it had arrived in front of Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s chest.

One shouldn’t underestimate this single arrow, as it had the combined force of three different Mystical Powers.

The Eye of Truth saw through to the weakest point in Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s defenses; it was followed by the activation of the Exterminating Dragon Star Arrow, which was then sped up with the power of lightning, increasing the speed of this arrow to its maximum, which, at the same time, was shot towards the point that Xuanyuan Zi Guang would find the most difficult to defend.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang paled drastically, and at the first possible moment, activated his bloodline inheritance. Endless flames surged out from within his body, and in an instant, he had surpassed the level of the Flower Blossom Tier, and stepped onto the plane of the Spiritual Infant Tier.

Ancient divine beasts such as true dragons and true phoenixes roared around him. He looked like a son of Heaven that had descended onto the mortal plane, with the air of a supreme ruler.

Pu!

The arrow hit its target, yet did not pierce through Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s chest. There wasn’t even a sign of blood; it merely tore through the part of the clothing that covered his chest, and revealed a navy-blue armor. It was currently shining brightly, and had forcefully disintegrated the arrow of Origin Power.

“Hahahaha, destiny rides on my shoulders, and I can even pick up treasures while walking on the road. Since I am destined, how could I possibly be defeated in your hand?” Xuanyuan Zi Guang declared, laughing wildly. With a wave of his right hand, thirty-six treasured sabers of various shapes and sizes flew out, and surrounded Ling Han.

“Heaven Star Annihilating Saber Array!” he shouted.

“Here it is again. Every time you throw a move, you must announce its name. Don’t you get annoyed?” Ling Han mocked, though he did not dare to show the least bit of carelessness in his expression. This Saber Array was considerably terrifying, and possessed the ability to pose a threat to him.

“Tell me the location of Helian Xun Xue, or I will definitely kill you!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang took control of the Saber Array without immediately releasing its might, and merely looked coldly upon Ling Han.

“You’re crazy!” Ling Han refused in disdain. He drew his long sword, and the Desolate Hell Sword displayed its awesome power, standing steadfast against the terrifying saber intent.

“Heng, so you are planning to ask for trouble!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang declared coldly, and manipulated the Saber Array to charge at Ling Han.

Ling Han brandished his sword to parry the oncoming attack, but Xuanyuan Zi Guang was really very strong. Under the attack of Saber Ray, ferocious light was all that was left within the Saber Array, and every streak of light could become a mortal threat to any Flower Blossom Tier cultivator.

No, even Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators would be shaken. That was Saber Ray, after all, and the destructive power it possessed was really too terrifying.

Qi and Ray were on two completely different levels, just like how there was a large difference of power between Flower Blossom and Spiritual Infant Tiers.

Ling Han was having a really tough time staying on the defense. Thankfully, not only was he nimble, his defenses were also very shockingly powerful.

Firstly, he had Origin Power, which he could form into a defense. Additionally, he also had a physique on the level of Tier Six treasure metal, and even if these two layers were penetrated, he still had the Indestructible Heaven Scroll circulating inside his body, which would allow him to instantly heal majority of his injuries.

Worse come to worst, he still had six drops of Indestructible True Fluid, which was more than enough to revive him quite a number of times.

The Saber Ray ripped forth, and Ling Han cut a very sorry figure.

These thirty-six sabers should belong to a whole set, and belonged to some great cultivator from the ancient times, yet had, for some reason, fallen into Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s hands. Just like this guy had said, he could easily pick up treasures by merely going outside, so he was born with great luck.

‘F***, do you think you’re the only one with treasures?’

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Just some pieces of scrap metal, just see as I take them all in!”

“Just continue to brag!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang sneered coldly. “Tell me the location of Helian Xun Xue!” He could really be considered a romantic; it was apparent that Helian Xun Xue had not paid him much attention, but he still was deeply in love with her.

Ling Han flipped his right hand, and drew out the Heaven Transformation Bowl.

“Take them!” He activated the treasured item, and instantly, multiple interwoven patterns appeared. Weng, the stone bowl instantly rose into the air, and shone with endless light.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Immediately, three treasured sabers were taken in.

‘What!?’

Everyone was struck completely dumb. They could all plainly see the might of the Saber Array, yet this stone bowl that Ling Han had drawn out could actually destroy the Saber Array and take in the treasured sabers; it was really an unbelievable sight.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang was even more dumbfounded. He was very clear about the power that these thirty-six treasured sabers had; after they were taken in by that stone bowl, he had completely lost all contact with them, as if they had completely disappeared from this plane of existence.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. A stone bowl did not have any kind of emotions; it merely continued to take in the treasured sabers, and in the time for a few breaths, it had taken in another seven sabers.

“This, this is...” Nong Man Man’s beautiful eyes shone. She recognized that this was the bottom of that Refine Celestial Bottle, which was something that she had her eye on. She had never thought that it was actually a stone bowl, and would actually possess such powerful might.

Her desire to obtain it increased.

Wang Yi Yun’s eyes narrowed as well. She imagined that if her Senior Brother Lang could obtain this treasure, he would be like a tiger that had grown wings; even the Little Saber King, Yao Hui Yue, or Dong Ling Er would easily be swept aside by Senior Brother Disciple Lang’s might.

However, how would she be able to obtain this treasure? Ling Han would bend to neither force nor persuasion, and was not that easily handled.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang hardened his heart, and shouted, “Explode!”

Weng, the remaining twenty-six treasured sabers shone with a sharp light at the same time, and the patterns on their blades spread out as if they were cobwebs before instantly vanishing.

The Spirit Tool would self-explode!

Ling Han was astonished—what kind of Spirit Tool was capable of exploding by itself? Only those Spirit Tools that had formed their own Tool Spirits, but since they had formed their own Tool Spirits, the latter would be similar to ordinary living creatures, wherein life was their most important priority. Unless in desperate straits, they would definitely not self-explode.

For example, the Black Tower. If Ling Han actually wanted Small Tower to explode itself, just see if Small Tower would actually pay him any attention.

But with the command of Xuanyuan Zi Guang, these Spirit Tools all chose to explode at the same time, as if he was the ruler of the Spirit Tools. Now that his command was announced, they were unable to refuse.

F***, these Spirit Tools were Level Seven treasures, and were unable to express their full might in Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s hands, but the moment they exploded themselves... just imagine, if twenty-six high-level Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators chose to use their full might, and unleash a move that would kill themselves along with their enemies, how terrifying would the power of this blow be?

Without another word, Ling Han rode on lightning and tried his best to break out of the siege.
