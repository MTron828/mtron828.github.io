2808 Enemy in the Void

These Heavenly Venerates couldn’t stop Ling Han, because Ling Han wasn’t teleporting through space, but rather traversing between dimensions.

The level involved was higher by who knew how many times.

“This brat is traversing between dimensions!” Some Heavenly Venerates immediately came to a realization.

“After him!”

As long as one was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, one would be able to traverse between dimensions, let alone these Fourth Tiers. One after another, they tore rips into space and entered the Void.

However, the Void was the other side of Genesis World, which was full of chaos and endless darkness. Even if a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was to enter here, he would be groping in the dark and fall into Primal Chaos.

Here, no one could see far, and could get lost for eternity.

…Unless there were dimension coordinates to function as a guide, like a lighthouse.

But, how did Ling Han disappear?

Walking in such darkness, it was impossible to walk in a straight line. One would be circling around within a small space, as if being endlessly lost.

Logically speaking, everyone would be the same. Hence, Ling Han was naturally no exception, but where did he go?

“Unless… he has dimension coordinates!” someone suddenly exclaimed.

All of a sudden, all the Heavenly Venerates fell into silence.

This ought to be the only reasonable explanation, but their minds were still full of doubts. Even if he had dimension coordinates, how did Ling Han disappear so quickly?

This was naturally because there were countless Powers of Dimension within Ling Han’s body. It was as if he was a mini Genesis World, and naturally his speed of transmigrating dimensions was shockingly fast, so much so that even a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate could only stare blankly.

Ling Han traversed through space. He intended to come out in a high-level dimension. This dimension was high-level, so the probability of finding Devouring Metal would be much higher. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

About a year later, Ling Han was about to emerge in a high-level dimension when he suddenly felt a strong palpitation in his heart.

Dangerous, extremely dangerous!

Without hesitation, he immediately tore a rip into space and escaped from the Void.

He fell out in an unknown place. All he could see was that this place was surrounded by a sea of boiling flames, flames so fierce that Ling Han felt slightly painful from being scorched. But this wasn’t the biggest crisis—a black whip could be seen lashing out from the Void.

Not a black whip, but rather… one of Hysteria’s tentacles!

Ling Han felt greatly alarmed, while the hair all over his body stood on ends.

He wasn’t a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate who could compete with Hysteria—it was said that even the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates had to join forces with others to fight against Hysteria, and moreover had to rely on the power of the Flaming Frost Realm. How could a First Tier Heavenly Venerate fight against it?

Ling Han hastily stretched out, and shua, the Void was instantly smoothed out with a wave of his hand.

Boom.

Even so, Ling Han still felt the space tremble, and as a wave of energy passed by, his face turned pale involuntarily, and he felt so uncomfortable that he wanted to vomit blood.

Hysteria was too strong—a shock wave across space could make Ling Han, one who possessed the strength of a Third Tier, want to vomit blood. It was truly horrifying.

Ling Han gasped. Back then, Hysteria had precisely followed the “lighthouse” of the Celestial Realm to locate it. Fortunately, Zhou Heng had been there at the time. Otherwise, had Hysteria’s tentacles penetrated into the dimension, the damage caused would’ve been extremely terrifying.

The Void was Hysteria’s territory.

Ling Han could freely travel between dimensions—that was because he had infinite Powers of Dimensions within his body, and thus could go to any dimension that he chose. Hysteria did not have such a great ability, but it was a dimension itself, and would never lose its way in the Void; it would only at most be unable to find the “exit.”

It would seem that traversing between dimensions was also dangerous because therein lay the most terrifying existence in the world: Hysteria.

Ling Han sat within the sea of flames, took a few breaths, and then observed the surrounding environment.

Where was this place?

He strode out of the area engulfed by the sea of fire, which took him more than a year. This place was covered only by a sea of fire, and had nothing else. Even if a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate was to come here, it would also be unbearable for him.

This could be regarded as a danger zone of the world. What was burning wasn’t Regulations, but rather the Power of Dimension, which had erupted in the form of fire.

Whether it was fire, ice, lightning, or other Regulations, it was actually a form of energy, which was what Wally had always emphasized.

Only then did Ling Han walk into the high-level dimension that he wanted to go to, which was called Intense Blaze Realm. Among the high-level dimensions, it was ranked 19th, which was still considered very high.

He released all the women, and as they went sightseeing, he searched for Devouring Metal.

Why did he choose this dimension?

It was because this dimension had produced the least number of Heavenly Venerates among all the high-level dimensions. Therefore, the probability of there being Devouring Metal would be higher compared to other dimensions.

Everyone kept looking for it and cultivated as they did so. After all, this was a high-level dimension with an abundance of Spiritual Qi.

Year after year, they continued to search, and after almost 70,000 years, they finally found a piece of Devouring Metal. However, Ling Han wasn’t satisfied, as currently there was also Hu Niu besides the Empress.

As for the large black dog, the Rain Emperor, and others, Ling Han wouldn’t worry about them; he couldn’t be the one to take care of everything, after all.

Ling Han took out a large amount of Godly metal to be consumed by the Devouring Metal. With his current wealth and power, it was a trivial matter for Devouring Metal to advance to the next level, and it only took a few thousand years. This sword made of Devouring Metal was successfully transformed into a Heavenly Venerate Tool.

This sword was given to the Empress—Hu Niu couldn’t compete. Who asked the Empress to bring up her precious daughter, suppressing Huniu to the point that she had lost all notion of throwing a tantrum? Hu Niu could only ask Ling Han to work harder so that she could also give birth to a healthy baby boy as soon as possible.

However, they had searched here for more than 70,000 years, but it was to no avail, so they moved on to the next dimension.

This time, Ling Han didn’t directly traverse between dimensions. He had decided that unless he had no other alternative, he would obediently journey through the passageway of the two realms.

After spending more than 600,000 years in this dimension, they finally found another piece of Devouring Metal. Hu Niu happily took it and nurtured it herself.

They all had a clear goal before, but now that they had got two supreme precious tools, they suddenly became idle.

“What are we going to do now?” All the women looked at Ling Han.

Ling Han thought for a while, and said, “Let’s go back to the Flaming Frost Realm and take a look there. After leaving for so long, there’s no telling what changes have happened in that place. Moreover, we wanted to obtain more Heavenly Venerable Seals, which also necessitates us going back there.”

All the women nodded. They knew that Ling Han could traverse through space, so they didn’t have to worry about being attacked by elites.

Ling Han made arrangements for his parents and others to live in this dimension. He would come to bring them back once he resolved his issues in the Flaming Frost Realm.

Thousands of years later, Ling Han and the women walked through the dimensions, and returned to the Flaming Frost Realm.

...

Ling Han was very low-key. Now that there wasn’t any threat of Hysteria, all the Heavenly Venerates entered into a rhythm of internal strife. It couldn’t be helped, as the Heavenly Venerates also had selfish motives—some wanted to compete for the cultivation resources for their descendants, while some would plunder Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Originally, the presence of Hysteria had been a pressure that forced the great Heavenly Venerates to unite, but now that the pressure had disappeared, the will of the people was naturally dispersed.

Ling Han first went to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. He hadn’t seen his daughter for a long time, and missed her very much.

However, after he had come to the Martial Academy, he realized that his devotion had come to naught as Ling Xi had gone out for training.

“Yi, isn’t this Little Han?” Behind him, the voice of the large black dog rang out.
