How were they supposed to pay compensations without money?

Simple, sign a slavery contract.

…Liu Jun would have to concoct alchemical pills for Ling Han without charge for 10,000 years. Of course, this was in real time. However, the ingredients for pill concoction would naturally be supplied by Ling Han. Otherwise, Liu Jun would really be crying himself to death.

And Gu Yushu would have to honor Ling Han as his boss, and the time was also 10,000 years. In that time, he would have to beat up anyone Ling Han commanded him to, with absolutely no questions asked.

After the slavery contract was signed, Ling Han finally allowed Liu Jun and Gu Yushu to leave.

“Now what do we do?” When they returned to the proximity of the academy, Liu Jun asked this question with a crestfallen expression.

Now, he was really extremely regretful. He had just wanted to find a shop with an acceptable location, and in the end, not only had he lost an astronomical amount of wealth, he had even sold himself into the deal, forced to concoct alchemical pills for 10,000 years without charge!

Meanwhile, Gu Yushu’s hands were balled into fists, his face pale and ashen.

He thought for a moment, and then said, “That man is just relying on women; his own strength would not be all that powerful! And that woman is indeed strong, I am not— I was too careless. Once I find a few more people, it will not be difficult to suppress her.”

Liu Jun couldn’t help but disagree inwardly. ‘You were clearly no match for her, all right? And you claim you were being careless?’

However, he basically agreed with Gu Yushu’s opinion. Though Hu Niu was very strong, as long as several Heaven Soul monarch tiers worked together, she could still be easily suppressed.

“I can get a few people,” Gu Yushu continued, “but just to be safe, we had best get a few more, and that will be up to you.”

Liu Jun could only nod in response. He, too, had no wish to concoct alchemical pills for Ling Han for 10,000 years for free—if that was in the Time Cultivation Chamber, that wouldn’t be 10,000 years, but rather 100,000 years, or even 1,000,000 years!

If he knew that Ling Han’s Black Tower could accelerate time by 100,000 times, he would probably cry himself to death.

Wasn’t it just concocting a few more Secret Construct Pills? He was a Three-Star Alchemist, and would soon be advancing into the ranks of Four-Star Alchemists. The Secret Construct Pill was not a very difficult task for him.

The two of them went their separate ways, each going to get help.

Half a day later, they met up again, and this time it naturally was not just the two of them anymore, but rather a total of 11 people.

Among them, Gu Yushu had invited five people, while Liu Jun had gotten four. Aside from Liu Jun, the other 10 people were all Heaven Soul monarch tiers.

Why would there be so many Heaven Soul monarch tiers?

Very simple. Firstly, this was Saintly Origin Academy, which had practically gathered all the monarch tiers in the entire Celestial Realm. Secondly, it was extremely hard to break through to the Immortal Palace Tier. Thus, even monarch tiers would be stuck on this stage, and have no means of easily advancing to the next level.

“Brother Gu, are we going to hunt a ferocious Immortal Palace Tier beast?” a monarch tier asked, laughing.

There were a total of 10 Heaven Soul monarch tiers, and that was indeed enough to be qualified to battle a First Secret elite.

Yet Gu Yushu answered darkly, “Don’t be careless. That woman may only be a Heaven Soul monarch tier as well, but her battle prowess is stronger than any ordinary monarch tier’s. Otherwise, I would not have needed to ask for your help.”

“Hehe.” The monarch tiers all laughed, and did not refute his words, yet they all showed arrogant expressions.

…You couldn’t defeat her, because you were too weak.

What was a monarch tier? A monarch tier could still be invincible against an opponent that was superior by two minor levels!

If you couldn’t be invincible, why call yourself a monarch tier?

Gu Yushu did not offer further explanations. In any case, they would know once they actually fought her. And what he wanted even more was to snatch his slavery contract back from Ling Han’s hands. Otherwise, this would be his lifelong shame, and others would be laughing to death at him.

The 11 people immediately charged towards the Rain Imperial Pavilion, and very soon arrived at their destination.

“Han Lin, come out!” Gu Yushu shouted loudly.

“Is there any lackey like you?” Ling Han stuck out a head from a window of the second floor. Though it had only been a day, with the means at the hand of people of the Celestial Realm, it was naturally no big deal for them to rebuild a structure.

“Lackey?” The other monarch tiers heard this, and all looked at Gu Yushu strangely. They were only aware that Gu Yushu had taken some losses, but what was the meaning of the word “lackey”?

“Ignore him. You guys only have to suppress that woman. As for that man… leave him to me!” Gu Yushu was in a bit of fury due to humiliation.

“Sure.” The other nine monarch tiers all nodded. Since they had all agreed to accept the benefits that Gu Yushu and Liu Jun had promised, they naturally were duty-bound to work for them.

They stood, arms crossed behind their backs. Since that woman did not come out, there was no significance or need for them to move.

Yet Gu Yushu gave a harsh cry, and he leaped towards the window on the second floor.

Xiu, a figure darted out, approaching Gu Yushu.

‘Huh?’

Gu Yushu couldn’t help but feel stunned. Though the person who had moved was a woman, it was not Hu Niu, and this woman’s battle prowess was also incredibly astonishing. The moment she moved, he felt a powerful pressure in no way inferior to that of Hu Niu, who had exchanged blows with him before.

Peng!

With just one strike, Gu Yushu was struck down. Half his body had sunk into the dirt, but he fortunately had not been injured severely.

At this, the other nine monarch tiers looked solemn. Though the person who had moved had had a geographical advantage, the fact that she had managed to strike down Gu Yushu with a single punch meant that she was clearly enjoying an absolute upper hand in terms of strength.

Gu Yushu had not exaggerated; this woman indeed could not be underestimated.

“Who are you?”

But once Gu Yushu spoke out, everyone almost passed out.

How could you not recognize her?

Hold on, could it be that this was not the woman who had defeated Gu Yushu?

This woman was dressed in sunny yellow robes and very beautiful, but her bearing was incredibly majestic and noble, as if she was a supreme empress, such that others wanted to kneel down at her feet in worship.

Of course, it was the Empress.

“She is Ugly!” Hu Niu appeared in succession, and stood with the Empress, one on either side.

The Empress disdained arguing with Hu Niu, and was incredibly aloof and refined.

Gu Yushu faltered a little, and then said, “Everyone, I will leave these two women to you.”

“No big deal!” The nine great monarch tiers all nodded. Though they admitted that the Empress was strong, and similarly did not dare treat Hu Niu carelessly, since she was cut from the same cloth, judging from the way the two women moved, they were not yet heaven-defyingly strong.

With nine monarch tiers working together, suppressing the two women would be a small matter. In fact, capturing them was not impossible, either.

Gu Yushu nodded, and turned to look once again at the second floor, exclaiming, “Han Lin, what else do you have up your sleeve now?” As his words fell, he leaped once more towards the second floor, and this time, neither Hu Niu nor the Empress moved to stop him.

Peng!

A gigantic fist descended from the skies, bearing an endless air of dominance. Then, Gu Yushu was seen to have no ability to defend himself, and was struck down forcibly by this punch, being embedded heavily into the ground.

Everyone couldn’t help but pale, feeling a powerful chill rise up from the depths of their hearts.

Whichever of them this punch fell on, there would be completely no way for them to defend. They could only be crushed, just like Gu Yushu.

But what was more horrifying was the person who had launched the punch was clearly only a Heaven Soul!

The Dividing Soul Tier and Immortal Palace Tier had completely different auras, and even a Severing Mundane Tier would be able to distinguish that—on the basis that the party in question had made a move.

How was this possible?

They were both Heaven Souls, and Gu Yushu was a monarch tier at that, and he actually could not block a single punch from the other!

They all looked towards the person who had launched the punch, and saw Ling Han casually withdrawing his fist, looking completely unconcerned.

“I just happen to be short of a few lackeys. SInce you guys have delivered yourselves to my doorstep, if I don’t take you guys in, won’t it be letting down your kind intentions?” Ling Han chuckled. As his eyes swept over the nine monarch tiers below, that smile was eerily chilling.

The nine great monarch tiers exchanged looks, and then simultaneously turned in the opposite direction and fled.
