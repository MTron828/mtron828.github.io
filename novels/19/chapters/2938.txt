2939 Take your life

Within the next 100 years, the Hysteria army would go on to launch over 30 assaults of varying scale. However, they all fell flat, unable to advance a single step.

Thank you readers!

In all these battles, Feng Wuding displayed the best performance of all.

It was as though he wanted to prove to everyone that he was the only one who could defeat Hysteria and become the savior of the Genesis World. To that end, he used every ounce of strength in all his battles without holding anything back.

In the most recent battle, he released 21 dimensional projections, surpassing Ling Han’s previous number of 20.

It was obvious Feng Wuding was satisfied with being able to prove that he was better than Ling Han.

On the other hand, Ling Han wasn’t all too concerned about it. Such contests for pride were pointless; actual strength in battle was what he cared about.

200 years, 500 years… They had defended against the Hysteria army countless times.

In the blink of an eye, 1,000,000 years had passed.

Ling Han wasn’t going to stop with his decapitation missions. Even though they were now able to withstand the attacks from the Hysteria army, there would be a difference in the number of casualties with and without an intelligent monster taking charge.

Ling Han would bring Bai Mifan, Xuan Feng, and Fu Yuan with him. Given his current strength, he was more than capable of guaranteeing their safety, so he thought it would be good to train them a little as well.

On the other hand, Feng Wuding was trying to compete with Ling Han on all fronts. He also started his own little guerilla strike force, taking along three members as he continuously killed his way into enemy territory. He wanted to compete against Ling Han on their battle records.

However, Feng Wuding didn’t have the ability to traverse the void. There were a few times he got trapped by the enemy, and while he was able to escape, his three teammates all perished under the encirclement.

After repeated failures, it didn’t matter if he was the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era. There was no Heavenly Venerate willing to risk their life with him.

As a result, Feng Wuding could only try to do things by himself. However, there was one time he fell for the enemy’s trap, and had to be rescued by Ling Han, Xin Qihu, and the other generals. After that, he never charged into enemy territory again.

It was too embarrassing.

“Hahaha!” Bai Mifan, Xuan Feng, and Fu Yuan burst out laughing when they heard the news.

They didn’t like Feng Wuding to begin with. It was natural they would be ecstatic to see him fail so miserably.

“To think he dreams of competing against us. I hope he learns his lesson now,” Bai Mifan said. He had always resented Feng Wuding ever since he lost to him. However, because they were equal in terms of cultivation level, Bai Mifan didn’t have any advantage in battle, and thus could not defeat Feng Wuding.

“Come, come, come. Let’s drink.” Fu Yuan raised his cup.

Ling Han and the others also raised their cups and clinked them together.

They were not within the base at the moment. Instead, they were at a spot about three days’ journey from it. Originally, this place was just a regular valley, but it had become quite a scenic spot because of the clashing of two dimensions.

“That said, Feng Wuding is powerful indeed. If Boss wasn’t around, he would be virtually unbeatable by anyone of the same cultivation level,” Xuan Feng mused.

Bai Mifan and Fu Yuan nodded their heads. They couldn’t deny that.

“There’s no helping it. He only has his own luck to blame for being born in the wrong era and meeting our boss.” Fu Yuan laughed.

Even though both Fu Yuan and Xuan Feng were both Fifth Tiers, they had no qualms about calling Ling Han their boss.

One’s cultivation level mattered when it came to the realm of martial prowess, but one’s strength even more so.

“Once Boss gains another level and becomes a Fifth Tier, he will have a Seventh Tier’s battle prowess. There’ll be no one stopping him then,” Fu Yuan said. Even though he was just trying to flatter Ling Han, there was an ounce of truth in it as well.

Ling Han was just about to speak up, but he suddenly turned his head, ears perked.

“What’s wrong?” Bai Mifan asked.

Ling Han gestured for everyone to keep quiet.

After a while, he said, “We have a guest.”

“Who?” Bai Mifan and the others asked.

“It’s us.” A voice resounded as a plain-looking man casually approached. He had a faint smile on his face, and his eyes were narrowed into slits, as though they couldn’t be opened.

“May I ask who you are?” Fu Yuan immediately stood up.

“Also, you said ‘us’?” Xuan Feng asked.

Soon, more figures appeared, each one of them with an imposing presence.

Fifth Tier, Fifth Tier, Fifth Tier. These people were all Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates, and there were as many as 88 of them. Each one of them had a terrifying aura.

Ling Han swept a glance across. “Something I can help you with?”

“We’re here to take your life,” the plain-looking person said.

“I take it you’re all just like Meng Dong, and are Hysteria’s agents?” Ling Han acknowledged them.

“Indeed,” the plain-looking person said. He bowed slightly. “I am Huangfu Dongyue. Little Brother, I’ve wanted to meet you for a long time, and now that we have, I must say, it’s such a pity.”

He was implying that if Ling Han hadn’t “betrayed” Hysteria, then they would have been a family, and would’ve met much earlier.

Ling Han laughed. “Well, better late than never.”

Another Fifth Tier pointed a finger at Ling Han, and rebuked angrily, “Ling Han, do you think you can just do as you please after betraying the main body?”

‘What?!’

Bai Mifan, Xuan Feng, and Fu Yuan were all taken aback. Judging from the other party’s words, it seemed like Ling Han was one of Hysteria’s agents, but had switched sides.

Ling Han… was one of Hysteria’s men?

The news was too overwhelming. If it were to spread to the Realm Battlefield, it would be sure to cause a great commotion.

Who would dare use one of Hysteria’s men? After all, he could suddenly go berserk and stab you in the back.

Bai Mifan looked at Ling Han, and asked, “Brother Ling, you?”

“Boss!” Xuan Feng and Fu Yuan were also astonished.

Ling Han casually waved his hand. “I’ll explain it to you later.”

“There is no later. You are going to die here right now!” Huangfu Dongyue coldly remarked.

“Is that so?” Ling Han looked around at the Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates, and couldn’t help laughing. “It’s not that I’m looking down on you all, but to me, you’re all nothing more than cannon fodder. I can take you all on with one hand even if you come at me together.”

“Then I’d like to see you try!” Huangfu Dongyue said in a somber tone. He then shouted, “For the main body!”

“Our deaths will only return us to the main body!”

10 Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates immediately shouted back, and then leapt forward together. After that, something strange happened as all 10 of them started to fuse together. Their resulting aura skyrocketed, instantly breaking through the limitations of the Fifth Tier and reaching Sixth Tier.

Bai Mifan and the rest were flabbergasted. How was this possible?

Ling Han had seen it before, so he wasn’t surprised. However, he couldn’t help frowning.

This was their trump card? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Hysteria should know that he already had a Sixth Tier’s battle prowess. It didn’t matter what kind of combination monster they threw at him. Even if all these people were to fuse together, they wouldn’t be able to beat him as long as they didn’t reach the Seventh Tier.

Seventh Tier?

That was not possible. Even if Hysteria’s body became an entire dimension, it couldn’t possibly create a Seventh-Tier combatant.

However, these people had sure been hiding themselves for a significant amount of time, and now they were revealing themselves all in one go. Wouldn’t this just be a foolish act if they weren’t absolutely sure of themselves?

Hysteria would never do something so foolish. Moreover, these people had actual intelligence, and naturally wouldn’t be so stupid, either.

Hold on. How did all these people suddenly show up here?
