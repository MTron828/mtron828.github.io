Chapter 1656: Breaking the formation

Ling Han turned around, and headed in the direction of the large man.

His speed was astonishingly swift, and even the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others had slight difficulty following him. They saw him throwing out punches repeatedly, destroying each of the fierce beasts that attacked them with a single punch.

The consequence that this led to was indeed the ever increasing number of the fierce beasts as they consistently pounced on them.

Every fierce beast that the formation gave rise to had the battle prowess of an early stage Saint King. It was still fine if there were only a few, but after the number had reached a few hundred, the battle prowess definitely could be compared to that of a peak stage Saint King, and even Ling Han would have to expend slightly more effort.

More importantly, the number of the fierce beasts was continuously increasing. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The large man that was controlling the formation smirked coldly. ‘How can you possibly reach me if you barge around forcefully like that? It would not even be a third of the way here, and you would be surrounded by the fierce beasts, like a tiger that would be torn apart by a pack of wolves.’

However, Ling Han’s strength had far surpassed the large man’s expectations. Only when he had traveled four-fifths of the way was Ling Han surrounded by an ocean of fierce beasts, and was not able to take another step further.

“Hahaha, I really have never seen someone as stupid as you!” The large man scoffed in derisive laughter. This formation was unique. There was no future in breaking the formation by force, and the best strategy would be to actively weaken one’s cultivation level, and merely stay on the defense, making no move to attack to prevent more formation beasts from appearing. Only then would one have the chance to walk out of the great formation.

But in that way, the man guarding the formation would only have to unleash a fierce offensive, and he would be able to fluster the person who had entered the formation completely. So, there was a choice: would you release your full strength, or not?

Ling Han paid him no regard. He merely shot out punches continuously, destroying each and every fierce beast, and causing the formation to give rise to even more.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others were all confused by his actions. ‘Aren’t you simply asking for trouble like this?’

Ling Han only rained down blows. By now, the number of fierce beasts was more than 100,000. Though it was impossible that they would all attack at the same time, when several hundred or several thousand attacked simultaneously, this was still enough to make a peak stage Saint King sweat.

But when Ling Han destroyed another fierce beast, the fierce beast that had been turned into over 100 pieces still wanted to form their respective bodies again, yet it only turned into multiple masses of black Qi that was continuously struggling. They did not immediately form over 100 new fierce beasts like how they had before.

Not only that, even the over 100,000 fierce beasts that had already formed did not attack again. Instead, it was like they had become drunk, and were stumbling and shaky in their steps.

What was going on here? The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others all looked at Ling Han with surprise.

Ling Han stopped, and said, “Whether it is a formation or a human being, there is always an upper limit. No matter how strong your potential is, when you are forced to the end of the line, you will immediately crumble. A formation is the same; when it is forced to its limits, it would automatically collapse.”

And as if they were an explanatory note for his words, thunderous booms were heard when he had just finished his words. The great formation had collapsed on its own, and those fierce beasts had all exploded one after another.

...Though Ling Han did not know this formation of a different system, he could be considered a grandmaster in terms of formations, and all formations had one common characteristic, and that was that they all had upper limits.

Once you broke this upper limit, the formation would naturally be broken.

Boom, the great formation collapsed. In the distance, the large man whose upper body was bare was revealed to their eyes.

He looked completely dumbfounded. Though he had heard Ling Han’s explanation, he did not feel that his doubts had been answered at all. Instead, he looked like he had seen a ghost.

‘Are you a f******* freak!?’

It sounded simple, but to be able to force a formation to its upper limit, one would first have to be able to sustain the power of the great formation before that limit was reached. Even the tribe’s several elders were unable to accomplish that; even the tribal chief could not!

This young outsider actually had battle prowess on the level of the tribal chief!

This was too terrifying.

Ling Han stretched out a hand and grabbed that man over, and asked, “Have you been bitten by a dog or something? Why do you hate outsiders so much?”

The reason why he had such a guess was because the large black dog and the others had all entered here, and with how despicable that dog was, it would not be a strange thing for this large man to suffer a bit.

Just after he said this, he saw that the large man actually flushed bright red, seeming to feel both humiliated and furious.

This...!

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. His guess had actually been on the mark.

“Don’t laugh!” the large man roared loudly, and tried to kill Ling Han as if he had put his life on the line.

Yet he only had the battle prowess on the level of a Great Saint, so how could he possibly be a match for Ling Han?

Ling Han casually pressed down a hand. Pa, that man was instantly pressed onto the ground, his limbs stretched out, forming the Chinese character 大.

“Release me, or all of you will be dead!” The large man was very arrogant because this was the territory of the Zhao Tribe. In their own territory, whom did he have to fear? There were a total of 27 Nine Ring peak stage elites, and any one of them would be able to match this young outsider.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Even a captured prisoner dares to be so arrogant. Looks like you haven’t had enough suffering yet! Whatever I ask, you just have to answer. Otherwise, hoho, just pray for luck then.”

“You dare!!” the large man shouted. The great formation had already collapsed, so there would definitely be people coming from the tribe immediately. What did he have to fear?

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and Long Yushan, “The two of you, turn your heads around.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden immediately did as he said, while Long Yushan curiously asked, “Why?”

Pa!

Ling Han flicked out a finger, and the clothing on the large man immediately burst to pieces. In the beginning, his upper body was already bare, and now he had become completely naked.

Long Yushan hurriedly turned her head around, but her pretty face was incredibly red with embarrassment. She really wanted to pinch Ling Han severely a few times.

“You, what are you doing?!” The large man’s face had already turned livid. He was a great Nine Ring elite, yet his clothes had actually been destroyed by another, showing something that was not appropriate to be seen. He was too embarrassed.

“So small,” Ling Han evaluated.

“So small,” Xiao Gu repeated.

The large man was about to pass out. Being naked in public was bad enough, and they were still assessing his d*ck? Furthermore, you guys had gone too far. You were even parroting each other’s words. This was no way to insult another person.

This was practically even crueler than that despicable dog!

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Are you willing to answer questions now? Hoho, otherwise, it would not be an evaluation that is coming after. I will hang you up and send you back to your tribe so everyone can observe your ‘precious sword’!”

“No!” the large man exclaimed in a trembling voice. If that happened, how would he still have the face to see other people in the future?

“Then just honestly answer the questions,” Ling Han stated calmly. “How many groups of outsiders have you encountered here in total?”

“Just one group,” the large man hurriedly answered, having lost any intention of resisting.

“Who were they?” Ling Han asked further.

“There were a lot of them, at least 100.”

“Tell me the details.”

When he heard the large man explain in detail, only then did Ling Han find out that four and a half years ago, the Empress and the others had come here. Indeed, there had also been the Saint Kings from the Forbidden Lands with them, as well as some juniors, and they totalled up to about 100 people.

The large black dog had also been among them, and they, just like Ling Han’s group, had had a smooth journey in the beginning, but had been stopped when they had come here. The large black dog had even clashed with this man. It had quietly hidden inside the formation, and bitten off a chunk of flesh from this guy’s bottom.

Afterwards, through some negotiations, the Empress and the others were allowed to pass, and that large man also nurtured an extreme hatred for all outsiders. Now, Ling Han and his group had encountered him, so they naturally would suffer from him deliberately making things difficult for them. But the end result was that he experienced the second great loss that he had ever had in his lifetime.

“Outsiders, you have gone too far!” At this time, the elites of the Zhao Tribe had also rushed here, and they all glared at Ling Han and his group with menacing eyes.
