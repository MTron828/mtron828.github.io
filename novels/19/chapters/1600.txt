Chapter 1601: Returning to Star Sand Martial Arts Academy

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle landed, and Ling Han put it away. He strode towards the Chaotic Demon Palace.

Very soon, he arrived at the Chaotic Demon Palace. The Hysteria Demon Master met with him personally. Ling Han revealed some secrets of the Celestial Realm as appropriate, causing this Demon Master to be incredibly stunned. This had broken the understanding that he had maintained for innumerable years.

However, a Demon Master was still a Demon Master, after all. Very soon, he accepted this fact. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ling Han made him a promise. If he was able to tear open the barrier into the Celestial Realm one day, he would bring this Demon Master with him into the Celestial Realm. He also left some treasures behind. Those were treasures that he had robbed from the over 100 Heaven Demons, Earth Demons, and Black Demons. He casually chose a few, and they were enough to cause the Hysteria Demon Master’s eyes to widen and his heart to throb wildly.

“Ling Han, where are the two big sisters?” Ling Han had just walked out of the rooms of the Hysteria Demon Master when he saw Wu Jue immediately approach him, looking here and there.

Ling Han shot out a kick. “Those are my wives. You just go wherever you are wanted. If you still dare to let your imagination run wild, I will turn you into a eunuch!”

The little bottom’s expression was filled with grievance as he muttered something under his breath.

Mo Li came to send him off, and when she knew that the true limit of the Eternal River Tier was 10,000,000 stars, she couldn’t help but gape in shock. It was truly rare to see such an obvious change in expression from her.

Ling Han told her some tricks. These were methods that the various great Forbidden Lands had found after innumerable years. Ouyang Taishan revealed them to him, and Ling Han would never keep secrets from those close to him, especially regarding the profound secrets of cultivation.

He set out once more, and arrived at Cold Clouds Planet to pay a visit to the Overlord Sword Demon Master.

Previously, both the Hysteria Demon Master and Overlord Sword Demon Master had stepped out bravely for his sake, and he remembered this favor.

Ling Han similarly promised that he would bring the Overlord Sword Demon Master with him when he entered into the Celestial Realm, and also left behind some treasures as a token of his gratitude, which made this Demon Master very rueful. This was really like the saying, ‘seeking virtue and acquiring it’. Virtue had its reward, evil would get its retribution.

“Ling Han, remember to come back and see me,” Zhu Xuan said when he walked out, her tone full of tender feelings.

Ling Han did not have any designs on her at all, and decided to be honest so that she would not waste time on him. “Miss Zhu, I already have a few lovers, and you—”

“I’m not going to listen!” Zhu Xuan did not allow him to finish his words. She covered her ears with her hands, turned around, and ran.

Ling Han sighed. Hopefully, this would not be an ill-fated relationship. In any case, he would not be trifling with other women. Merely these lovers by his side were already enough of a headache for him.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle pierced through the air, and flew towards the Two Realm Passageway.

In truth, the Netherworld also had many Two Realm Passageways, and any one of them could reach the Immortal Realm, but Ling Han was not familiar with the other places of the Immortal Realm. What if he went even further if he exited from another passageway?

Forget it. He had best just go back on his original course. In any case, it was only a matter of a few years.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle traveled swiftly, while Ling Han and his companions cultivated inside the Black Tower.

Two years had passed; they had already arrived at the Two Realm Passageway. Furthermore, their strength had greatly improved as compared to two years ago. Not only had the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden advanced into the Eternal River Tier, she had even reached the medium extreme, and the Empress, meanwhile, had reached the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, and was presently working hard on breaching that most crucial breakthrough to advance into the pinnacle level.

In comparison, it was Ling Han’s cultivation level that had the smallest improvement. He just managed to reach the peak stage of the high extreme, and needed to settle down a bit. Then, he would burst through to the consummate level in one go.

“After entering into the Immortal Realm, the Hu Clan will be able to grasp the link of karma on me, and another battle is inevitable. However, the final power boost would be just right to be left for them!” Ling Han said to himself.

Hoping that the Hu Clan would learn their lesson and pull back? This was clearly not a realistic hope.

They traveled on foot, and began to pass through the Two Realm Passageway.

By now, all three of them were in the Eternal River Tier, and one of them had even reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. In this place, they were naturally absolutely invincible. However, they had no intention to commit bloodshed for no reason. In the Netherworld, they showed the unique traits of the Netherworld, and after entering into the Immortal Realm, they naturally changed.

Though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had not been able to merge the Regulations of the two Realms, she was able to change over. However, her power declined greatly after entering into the Immortal Realm. After all, she had previously been cultivating the Regulations of the Netherworld all this while.

After passing through the Two Realm Battlefield, they returned to the Immortal Realm. They all felt like they had finally seen the light of day again, though they had not stayed many years in the Netherworld.

They visited the Purple Moon Divine Maiden again, and what delighted them was the fact that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden actually managed to get a breakthrough in these few years, and had advanced into the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Of course, the Purple Moon Divine Maiden was definitely even more shocked because these three people were improving at an even faster pace than she.

As usual, Ling Han left behind some cultivation resources. With his present wealth, this naturally was no big deal.

After leaving the Purple Moon Army, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked, “Are we returning to Joint Peace Planet... or going to Wood Figure Planet?”

“Wood Figure Planet,” Ling Han replied without hesitation. He still had some matters to settle, such as asking Long Xiangyue about the whereabouts of her aunt so he could ask for a dragon’s horn.

The two women naturally voiced no objection. They once again traveled via the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, heading towards Wood Figure Planet.

They did not spend much time on their way there, and in a mere few months, they had already arrived on Wood Figure Planet. The Cloud Piercing Shuttle landed quietly, without alerting anyone of its presence.

Ling Han and his companions arrived at the eighth campus. This place was just like how it used to be. It was as if the matter with the Hu Clan had never happened before.

“L-L-L-Ling Han!”

Yet when they appeared at the entrance to the martial arts academy, they just happened to encounter a person that coincidentally walked out. When he saw the three of them, he was suddenly inconceivably shocked. Then, he flew into a thunderous rage, and shot out a punch right at Ling Han. “You bastard, you actually dare come back!!”

The Empress took one step forwards, and pressed down her palm on empty air. Peng, that person was immediately sent flying. In front of the present Empress, even such big shots like Cai Miao and Ren Feiyun would have to admit defeat.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and stopped the Empress’s next action. He asked, “So what if it is me? Why can’t I come back?”

The person struggled to get to his feet as he angrily exclaimed at Ling Han, “You’ve brought so much trouble to the academy!”

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. At the time, though he had drawn away the calamity, the Hu Clan probably wouldn’t have so easily spared the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, either. He nodded, and said, “After I left, what happened?”

The person finally replied after he repeatedly questioned thim. Though the Hu Clan did not commit a massacre in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, they still caused the academy to expend a lot of its wealth. Practically the whole treasury had been emptied.

In these years, the disciples of the academy all had a miserable time because their cultivation resources were unable to be distributed at all, and the main culprit was naturally Ling Han.

Ling Han rubbed his chin. He would definitely call the Hu Clan to an accounting for this debt. However much they took, he would have them repay 10 times, no, 100 times the amount.

“Ling Han!” Another man walked out, yet he immediately leaked a menacing killing intent.

Cai Miao!

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and said, “Senior Brother Cai, it’s been a long time! Previously, though you were very overbearing towards me, I still admit that you are a king tier in any case, yet you are actually willing to become the lackey of another, which causes me to look down on you!”

“Do not argue needlessly!” Cai Miao pointed at Ling Han. “You fled due to your fear of punishment, and implicated the academy. And now, you actually have the face to come back. I will... suppress you!”
