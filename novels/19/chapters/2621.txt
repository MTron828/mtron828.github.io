Chapter 2622: Giant Insect

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s ability to attract trouble remained the same as always. He was always able to come across second-generation young masters with astonishing backgrounds. Some coveted the Empress’ beauty, while others purely wanted to cause trouble. All of these people were naturally suppressed by Ling Han.

In just a few months, several hundred second-generation young masters had already died by his hands.

One could imagine just how many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the Ancient Tomb wanted his head.

However, Ling Han didn’t give a toss about this. In fact, he was slightly eager to come across these Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings as battling against them would allow him to experience profound pressure, and therefore accelerate his advance to the Ninth Heaven.

The three of them exited the lightning forest before crossing an incredibly wide river. They then traversed across a snowy mountain before finally entering the plains. The grass was only as tall as their feet, and it felt extremely soft and comfortable to the step.

!!

However, it was also in these plains that many Celestial Kings lost their lives. In fact, their blood dyed large swathes of the grass crimson red.

This was extremely uncanny. Just how powerful and domineering was Celestial King blood? If this blood splattered onto rocks, the rocks would immediately disintegrate and turn into dust. If it splattered onto grass and plants, then these grass and plants should have immediately exploded apart. How could it stain them like the blood of ordinary mortals?

Ling Han bent down to examine it. After a moment, he frowned, and said, “The domineering power of the blood has already been erased. It only contains the shell of a Celestial King’s might. It looks fearsome, but it’s actually completely useless.”

“What about their corpses?” the Empress asked.

They searched everywhere, but they couldn’t find the corpses of the Celestial Kings at all.

“Strange… Perhaps none of them died?”

There were signs of an intense battle, with large swathes of the plains wrecked. Strangely, however, they could only see the blood of Celestial Kings and no corpses. This was seemingly at odds with what the destruction suggested.

“Be careful!” Bewitching Maiden Rou said.

However, the Empress was brimming with fighting spirit. She hadn’t fought for an extremely long time.

They continued to advance. The plains were boundless, and it was as if they had no end.

Boom!

The ground before them suddenly cracked open, with a giant spear 30 meters long suddenly stabbing out from the earth, and viciously crashing down on Ling Han and the others. This spear was shrouded in the Great Dao, so even if one weren’t struck, just being shaken by the fluctuations of the Great Dao alone would already cause enough trouble.

The Empress humphed as she slashed down at the spear.

Weng!

Her sword struck the giant spear. Celestial Tools were invincible, and those that weren’t Celestial Tools or Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be unable to rival them. Thus, the giant spear was instantly cut in two, causing gray liquid to spray into the air.

However, the Empress was also sent flying back. The momentum of the giant spear had been far too great, far more than what the Empress was able to resist.

“Zhi!” There was a deafening squeak as a giant being suddenly tunneled out from the ground. This was a giant insect with six legs. It measured 60 or so meters in length, and only one of its two spear-like forelegs remained right now. This was because the other one had been severed by the Empress.

Its body was covered in black scales, and it was also enveloped in an eerie aura of death. It was as if this insect were a monster that had crawled out from the depths of hell.

It glared at the Empress as gray blood continued to flow from its severed leg. However, this bleeding quickly stopped, and there was a black glow as the severed leg started to regenerate. In just a few seconds, the regeneration was already complete.

The giant insect howled before stomping four of its legs and lunging at the Empress. Meanwhile, its two forelegs lashed out at the Empress’ jade-like neck.

Ling Han humphed as he flashed over, immediately blocking the giant insect’s path. He then reached over to grab at the giant insect.

The giant insect naturally couldn’t ignore him, so it changed the direction of one of its slashing forelegs, targeting Ling Han instead.

Ling Han raised his right palm, and channeled the Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning. He then combined this with the power of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll before unleashing a punch.

Weng!

The foreleg of the giant insect was like a divine spear, and in comparison, Ling Han’s fist appeared absolutely tiny and inconsequential. The outcome of this clash was seemingly clear for all to see. However, when the giant leg actually collided with Ling Han’s fist, there was a blinding flash of light as it was surprisingly sent flying back.

Crack…

A crack appeared on the giant leg, and this crack continued to spread further and further. In just an instant, cracks had already enveloped the entire leg.

Pa!

The giant leg surprisingly shattered into pieces.

This brought the giant insect immense pain, causing it to continuously emit a strange scream. Balls of nether flames erupted from its body, signifying its white-hot fury.

This time, however, the giant insect didn’t immediately launch an attack. Instead, it stared at Ling Han with its lantern-sized eyes that were filled with apprehension. Even though it was a violent being, it still possessed innate alertness to danger. It recognized that Ling Han was extremely powerful, so it couldn’t act in a rash manner.

However, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t give it time to rest, continuing to charge forward, and throwing a punch at the giant insect’s head.

The giant insect hurriedly reared its forelegs to block.

Peng!

However, how could it block Ling Han’s attacks? Its thick scales were instantly cracked open, after which Ling Han charged inside its head with azure lightning enveloping his body.

The giant insect’s movements immediately froze.

Pa!

After a short moment, it crashed to the ground, with a gaping hole appearing in its scales. Ling Han strode out of this hole with azure lightning around him, not a single mark on his body.

“Those Celestial King corpses… were mostly eaten by such things, right?” Bewitching Maiden Rou said.

Ling Han nodded in confirmation. Many Celestial Kings had definitely died in this place, yet there was no corpse in sight. Thus, it was only natural that they had entered the stomachs of these giant insects.

He grabbed a leg of the giant insect, and started to carefully examine it. Astonishment spread across his face, and he said, “There are many thin and hollow spikes on these legs. With a single swipe, it can send countless of these spikes into one’s body. It can then use them to absorb the essence from one’s blood.”

That being the case, even the blood shed by Celestial Kings would only be ordinary blood. Thus, they would be unable to cause any destruction.

“Let’s go!”

However, after a short while, they were attacked by another giant insect.

When these insects remained hidden underground, their auras would be completely concealed, thus rendering them impossible to discover. Only when they broke through the surface of the earth to attack would one be able to discover them. To Fifth Heaven and Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings, however, this would already be too late.

Fortunately, Ling Han and his two wives were no ordinary Fourth Heaven or Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings. Thus, they were entirely capable of dealing with these giant insects.

After a dozen or so days, they finally made their way out of the plains. What appeared before them was a small river that even had a wooden bridge spanning over it. Beside this bridge was a small grass hut, in front of which sat an elder on the ground. He was smoking a water pipe which was gurgling with bubbles.

A large group of people stood around this elder, and they all wore sulky expressions as if they had come across an insurmountable difficulty.

Looking closely, they discovered that this elder was actually engaged in a game of go with someone else. His tactics were extraordinary, and it was thus that he had the room to smoke his water pipe. Meanwhile, his opponent’s movements were stiff, with his brows knitted into a deep frown.

‘What’s going on?’

Ling Han tapped the shoulder of the person in front of him, and asked, “Brother, what’s this all about?”

The person was given a fright. A person had actually approached him without him noticing their aura? If Ling Han hadn’t tapped his shoulder, and had instead attacked him, wouldn’t he have already become a corpse?

However, upon discovering that Ling Han was only at the Fifth Heaven, he involuntarily heaved a sigh of relief. No matter what, he was still a Sixth Heaven Celestial King.

Mm-hm, it was most likely because he was engrossed in the game of go that he hadn’t noticed the approach of this brat.

With his temper, he should have turned back around and ignored Ling Han. After all, how dared a Fifth Heaven Celestial King question a Sixth Heaven Celestial King! However, upon seeing Ling Han’s mighty and dignified countenance, the man changed his mind for some unknown reason, replying, “If you want to cross this river, you have to first beat this old man in a game of go.”
