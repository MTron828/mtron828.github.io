Chapter 1184: Ginseng Spirit

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

One day, two days, three days...

Time quietly crept by.

The restriction on the Red Rain Divine King Tree was stronger than Ling Han had anticipated, and he still hadn’t been able to undo it even after 20 days. However, meditating on this medicinal mountain—in addition to comprehending dao under the Reincarnation Tree—actually helped his cultivation level advance another step. He had managed to form his fifth River!

Right now, he had reached the late stage of the pinnacle level!

If he advanced another step, he would reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level. This was the true limit of the Mountain River Tier, and one would possess a power of 10 stars upon reaching this level. In other words, their power would be on par with that of elites at the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

“What an unexpected surprise!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. He hadn’t managed to crack the restriction, yet his cultivation had advanced in leaps and bounds.

However, this was only natural. They ate Godly medicine all day long, and more importantly, they could comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree. That being the case, their cultivation would definitely advance rapidly even if they didn’t want it to.

Shui Yanyu’s and Hu Feiyun’s cultivation speed was also very quick. In fact, Shui Yanyu had already advanced to the consummate level. When considering the amount of time she had cultivated, this was an astonishing feat. Perhaps she would even become a key disciple upon returning to the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Meanwhile, Hu Feiyun managed to advance to the pinnacle level.

She was a clone of Empress Luan Xing, so she had actually completed this process nine times already. Thus, completing it for the 10th time was naturally as easy as a pie. It was just that she had been extremely flustered and panicked when undergoing a heavenly tribulation. It had truly been a sorry sight.

When Empress Luan Xing didn’t take control of her body, her battle prowess would be unbearably weak.

So-called one-star geniuses and two-star geniuses could battle against those one and two sub-minor levels above them, respectively. Meanwhile, the large majority of people possessed a battle prowess that was equivalent to their cultivation level. However, what about Hu Feiyun? She was an utter embarrassment!

Her battle prowess was at least one to two sub-minor levels below her cultivation level. As such, she could be labeled as a negative star idiot!

“I’m not an idiot! It’s just that I don’t want to fight!” she said in defense. However, she was still teased by Ling Han and Shui Yanyu. Even the Asura Demon Emperor dared to tease this “master’s wife”.

In any case, she could still suppress those at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier with ease, even if she was a negative star idiot. This was thanks to her incredible cultivation level. The pinnacle level was the pinnacle level, after all. Before other Mountain River Tier cultivators, those who had reached this level were as mighty and as indomitable as Sun Moon Tier elites.

Shui Yanyu was extremely envious of Hu Feiyun. She knew the limits of her own abilities, and she knew that it would be impossible for her to reach the pinnacle level, no matter how hard she worked. However, the ditzy Hu Feiyun had advanced to this level without so much as a sliver of effort.

“Wife, don’t be discouraged. Her situation is unique!” Ling Han said in comfort.

Shui Yanyu was aware of this, yet she still couldn’t bring herself to accept it, especially when she looked at Hu Feiyun’s muddleheaded and innocent expression.

Another 10 days passed, and Ling Han finally managed to undo the restriction. He placed the incredibly precious Red Rain Divine King Tree into his Black Tower—root, soil, and all.

Planting this Godly medicine in the Black Tower signified that it had truly become his.

Ling Han was ecstatic, and he pecked Shui Yanyu’s cheek, saying, “Mission accomplished! Let’s enjoy a kiss!”

“Shameless d*ckwad, eat my foot!”

Xiu!

A furious shout suddenly sounded, and a streak of white dashed over at an incredibly quick speed.

Although the unwelcome arrival had shouted “eat my foot”, the size of the white shadow made it abundantly clear that this wasn’t a person.

Ling Han had no time to dodge, so he immediately unleashed his Fast Technique, using his finger as a sword as he slashed toward the white shadow.

Weng!

His finger collided with the white shadow, instantly forming devastating shock waves.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Furious shock waves surged into the surroundings, forcing Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun to jump back in retreat.

Only at this moment did Ling Han see that white shadow clearly. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

Sure enough, this wasn’t a person. Rather, it was a medicine, a ginseng-shaped medicine. However, it actually had two legs and two arms, and there was even a human face on its “head”.

‘F*ck! This Godly medicine has gained a life of its own!’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and shouted, “Demonic ginseng, hurry up and return to my bowl!”

Since it was able to develop a spirit, this ginseng was definitely extremely high-grade. If he ate it, would his cultivation level soar by one or two minor levels?

“Ugly man, you’re still 800 years too young to eat your grandpa!” the ginseng roared in anger. “What are you waiting for? Hurry up and release that girl. She’s mine!”

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han lashed out with a kick, and said, “You’re a senile old ginseng, yet you actually want to steal my wife?”

“What do you mean your wife? I have my eyes on her, so she’s my property!” The ginseng wasn’t willing to back down, and it continued to use movement techniques to dodge Ling Han’s attacks.

Its power was nothing to write home about, yet its speed was tremendous. Ling Han had to use his Fast Technique if he wanted to keep up with the ginseng. Meanwhile, his Lightning Sword Technique was still lacking in speed, and thus he had no option but to abandon using it.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

The ginseng was relentless in its attacks, though it used the Regulations of heaven and earth rather than Origin Power. The Regulations transformed into countless divine chains that whipped toward Ling Han.

This was a ridiculous sight. A ginseng was circling around Ling Han and launching a relentless barrage of attacks at him, its actions as quick as lightning.

However, what was more unbelievable was the fact that this ginseng was actually a pervert! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Old ginseng, I’m definitely going to eat you!”

Ling Han used his finger like a sword and continued to launch attacks at the ginseng. He didn’t want to wound this Godly medicine. It had already developed intelligence and grown limbs, so its medicinal effects were definitely astonishing.

The lifespan of Godly medicines was far longer than that of cultivators—Level One Godly medicine was equivalent to the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier, yet the lifespan of a Level One Godly medicine could reach a maximum of one million years.

However, it was also because of this that it was extremely difficult for Godly medicine to develop intelligence. This was the natural law of heaven and earth—if one’s lifespan was long, they would naturally be especially weak and frail. This was the tradeoff.

Thus, the fact that this Godly medicine possessed both intelligence and limbs signified that it had lived for many years. At some point in its life, it had developed a fuzzy awareness, after which it had been able to slowly cultivate. Eventually, it had gained the ability to walk and even managed to grasp the power of Regulations.

‘This is a super-old ginseng, so it’s definitely full of vital energy.’

“Pei! Stinky brat, you can eat your grandpa’s ginseng feet!”

The old ginseng launched a kick that generated swirls of terrifying Regulations.

The old ginseng was especially quick, yet Ling Han’s defenses were extremely sturdy. The pinnacle level was no joke. They continued to skirmish, and their battle became more and more intense.

Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun were both stunned. An old ginseng could actually be this powerful?

What on earth?!

“Tsk, Brother Han, you don’t mind if I help, do you?” a soft and pleasant voice asked.

It belonged to a tall and slender woman—she was genuinely tall, only half an inch shorter than Ling Han. Her raven hair flowed down her back, and she was dressed in a snow-white silk dress. She wore no adornments, yet her breathtaking appearance and stunning figure exemplified the nature of natural beauty.

This was Shen Zhu’er, a king tier among the younger generation of the Majestic Heaven Sect!

She was asking if Ling Han needed help, yet she extended her hand toward the old ginseng right as she finished speaking.

“It’s a beauty!” The old ginseng’s eyes lit up, and it charged toward Shen Zhu’er’s chest.

Shen Zhu’er was given a fright, and she stammered, “P-perverted ginseng!”

She had only just arrived, and she had only stepped forward upon discovering that this old ginseng had already developed a spirit. She knew that it would have incredible medicinal effects. However, she hadn’t expected this old ginseng to be such a lowlife pervert.

It had targeted her breasts with its first attack! How utterly shameless!
