Chapter 3373= Sixth Change

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Pa! Young Master Cat fell to the ground.

The pitiful thing was that when he was dragged away by Eldest Baby previously, his pants were frayed and his butt was exposed. Now that he was lying face-down on the ground, he was exposed.

Fortunately, he was a demon cat after all, and his butt was also furry. Therefore, there were not many places that could be exposed. It could be considered as saving him some face.

Of course, Young Master Cat was still unconscious.

Outside, everyone was dumbfounded.

Previously, when everyone saw Young Master Cat enter and heard the sounds of fighting, they were extremely curious. Alright, there was no more movement.

Some people wanted to climb over the wall to take a look, but Young Master

Cat had already come out.

Everyone knew that Young Master Cat didn’t run out by himself, but was

thrown out by someone.

F*ck, what was going on here?

That was Young Master Cat! Young Master Cat, who had Inscription Tier-level battle prowess and could sweep through the entire academy, how could he be defeated in just a few moves?

Ling Han had actually become so powerful?

Everyone couldn’t help but feel a strong sense of reverence. Previously, although Ling Han had defeated Ying Changkong, he had relied on the power of his Spirit Tool, and not his true strength. However, looking at Young Master Cat now, he clearly hadn’t been injured by the ice.

Thus, this time, it should be because Ling Han’s strength had made another astonishing improvement. He could even defeat an Inscription Tier cultivator.

“Good job, Ling Han.”

“These fellows from the Demon Race are too arrogant. It’s time to strike a blow

to their arrogance.”

“The Holy Emperor is in seclusion, and Hong Tianbu has left. I thought that no one would be able to deal with them, but now, Ling Han has finally stepped forward!”

Everyone cheered and cheered for Ling Han, but they had no idea that only a few children had accomplished this magnificent feat.

In reality, it wasn’t that Ling Han didn’t want to fight, but that he was at the critical moment of breaking through to the Sixth Change.

Appreciation came without warning. If he did not grasp it tightly, he did not know when it would be able to come again. Perhaps he would never have the chance again.

Thus, when the appreciation arose within him, Ling Han immediately began to cultivate in seclusion, seizing this enlightenment.

He sat as still as a rock. From the outside, he was only breathing very slowly. Even his heartbeat seemed to have stopped. His physical body had entered a state of suspended animation, but in his mind, it was extremely exciting.

Streaks of appreciation flashed past like lightning, and Ling Han was trying to figure out the profound secrets of life.

If he wanted to increase his level of being, he naturally had to have a sufficient understanding of the essence of life, especially if he wanted to break through the limit.

Boom, strange and bizarre images were reflected in his mind. He was describing the essence of life.

Ling Han had no lack of understanding of life. In the world inside the Divine Stone, he was as strong as a Heavenly Venerable Tier elite. Although the two worlds were completely different, they had many similarities.

He revealed a smile. He already understood the secret of life.

‘That’ll do.’

He began to break through. Boom, his originally silent body erupted. The diamond-like light was dazzling, but as time passed, it dimmed and returned to a state of calm.

Ling Han immediately felt weak, and hurriedly took out the Long Rainbow

Fruit to consume.

Pa, pa, pa! A thunderous sound came from his body. The shackles were being torn apart.

After breaking through so many times, Ling Han also had an understanding in his heart. The more shackles he ripped through, the greater the leap in his leve of being would be.

Based on his experience, every time he tore open the shackles, there would be around five shackles, and then it would return to calmness, and he would need to wait for the next eruption. On the other hand, ordinary Blood Transformation Tier elites would at most be able to tear open two shackles, so the number of Treasured Fruits of Life required was very few, and one was enough.

For example, the little handmaiden and Lian Xuerong, and he had asked Xuanyuan Dingguo as well. Xuanyuan Dingguo was a little more powerful. If he was lucky, he could break three shackles and generally, it would be two shackles.

Why did Ling Han have the ability to fight above his level? It was because he broke through many shackles each time, and the evolution of his level of being far exceeded those of the same level.

Sure enough, after the five shackles were shattered, Ling Han’s surge also came to an end. There were still three Long Rainbow Fruits left.

Sixth Change!

Ling Han looked inside himself. The diamond-like blood was developing towards plain ordinary blood, but if it was displayed, it seemed that he had yet to reach the peak stage of Fifth Change, so his blood and Qi was not complete y diamond-colored.

He smiled in satisfaction. With this breakthrough, his battle prowess should be able to allow him to barely exchange a few blows with a One Pattern elite.

Ling Han was just about to get up, but all of a sudden, the cells in his body became incredibly active.

Hong, the activity of his cells actually pushed the evolution of his level of being once again, causing a huge uproar within Ling Han’s body.

‘What’s going on?’

Ling Han was shocked, and a thought flashed through his mind. Should he continue?

One had to know that he had just completed a breakthrough and had broken through his limit. Although his level of being had advanced, his body was in a very weak state and needed to be adjusted and repaired. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The advancement in level of being was extremely intense. Even if he had the Treasured Fruit of Life to offset the consumption, it was definitely not without any effort on his part at the same time.

Would another increase in level of being bring about harm?

In just an instant, Ling Han decided to break through!

He was already at the Sixth Change. If he made another leap in his level of being, he would be at the Seventh Change.

Seventh Change?

Even Chen Fengyan said confidently that there was no Seventh Change.

Ling Han did not know why he was able to achieve Seventh Change. Perhaps it was because he was different from the rest, because there were no dimensions in anyone’s cells, and countless living beings lived there.

This change was caused by his cells. It was very likely related to the dimensions in his body.

Although there was an unpredictable risk in breaking through now, what if there was no next opportunity if he missed it?

Ling Han’s incomparably strong desire for strength made him make a choice without hesitation.

He immediately consumed a Long Rainbow Fruit and continued to promote the evolution of his level of being.

Clang!

Thunder suddenly sounded in the sky. It was clearly a sunny day, but layers of dark clouds suddenly appeared. Lightning intertwined, and human figures could be vaguely seen. There was a golden giant that was 300 metres tall, a Demon God with three heads and six arms, and a Buddha that emitted golden light.

Such an abnormal phenomenon enveloped the entire capital. Everyone could see it clearly. Ordinary people trembled. Could it be that the heavens were dissatisfied?

Otherwise, how could they see all the gods and buddhas?

“Eh, why is there a phenomenon of heaven and earth?” Eldest Baby muttered. “Someone seems to have broken the restrictions of heaven and earth,” Sixth Baby continued.

“Is there such a freak in this place where Dao has declined?” Eldest Baby couldn’t believe it.

Second Baby activated her ocular technique and looked at the sky. “Let me trace it back to the source!”

Heaven and earth phenomena were definitely born from people and things, so there would be a strong causal relationship. Her eye technique could see through illusions and reach the essence, so she could find the life force from the cause and effect.

The other Calabash Brothers looked at her, and even the proud Third Baby turned her head slightly.

“F*ck!” Second Baby’s head looked up at the sky and then at eye level. Then, she suddenly cursed..
