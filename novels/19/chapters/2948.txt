2949 Rage of a Seventh Tier

Meanwhile, on Ling Han’s side.

Thank you readers!

Lin Luo’s doppelganger suddenly said, “Ling Han, you should leave now.”

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s true body was about to arrive, and even the dimensional suppression wouldn’t be able to affect him. Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were unstoppable.

Ling Han naturally understood what Lin Luo was trying to tell him. He had destroyed the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger, so his main body was going to charge over to vent his anger.

‘Sigh, what a narrow-minded bastard. I’ve been wronged and bullied to such a degree, yet have I flared up in rage yet?’

!!

Ling Han leaped toward the Empress and Hu Niu.

“Ling Han!” Feng Wuding roared, finally coming to his senses at this moment. He had seen the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger being destroyed, so knowing the pride of Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, he knew that the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate would definitely charge over to kill Ling Han at all cost.

Thus, he definitely couldn’t allow Ling Han to flee.

Of course, he didn’t believe that Ling Han could flee from the grasp of a Seventh Tier elite anyway.

He charged at Ling Han.

“Piss off!” Ling Han said as he unleashed his power at Feng Wuding.

Weng!

He channeled his 100 dimensions, causing his power to increase thousandfold as he sent Feng Wuding flying with a single punch.

His raw power, the Heavenly Venerable Seals, and the number of his dimensions… Ling Han enjoyed an advantage in all three areas, so how could Feng Wuding possibly rival him?

“See ya later!” Ling Han said as he grabbed the Empress and Hu Niu in his arms. “Everyone, we’ll definitely meet again in the future! Fiery Silk, Yue Borong, and Ten Thousand Shadows, I’ve remembered you three. Of course, there’s also you…”

His gaze became ice-cold as he pointed at Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan.

“Hmph! You think you can escape?” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan sneered. His cultivation was suppressed and he couldn’t necessarily capture Ling Han, but obstructing him and preventing him from escaping wouldn’t be too difficult.

Once the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate arrived, Ling Han would be as good as dead. No, he had already become a dead person the moment that he destroyed the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger.

“If I want to leave, no one will be able to stop me, not you, and not anyone else!”

Ling Han waved goodbye as he tore open the Void.

“Where do you think you’re going!” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan roared as he charged over. He thought that Ling Han was trying to teleport.

Whoosh!

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan gave chase. However, to say nothing of the fact that he was only a doppelganger, he would lose his way in the void even if this were his true body. This was a domain that was beyond him.

‘Not good!’ he exclaimed in his mind.

Weng!

A devastating aura descended as the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate arrived. His power was far too terrifying, so much so that even the surrounding space trembled in his presence, teetering on the brink of shattering.

“Where’s that insolent brat?” he asked as he swept his gaze around.

“Lord Shatter Mountains, Ling Han tore open the Void and fled. Lord Chong Yan is currently giving chase,” Feng Wuding hurriedly replied.

“He’s trying to teleport and flee?” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said with a cold chuckle. Teleportation was a skill within the Regulations, so how far could Ling Han flee? He immediately released his divine sense, and his overwhelming power as a Seventh Tier elite allowed him to instantly observe every corner of the Flaming Frost Realm.

However, he didn’t discover anything.

‘What’s going on? Don’t tell me he directly teleported to another dimension… Is that still teleportation?’

Whoosh!

He looked over, only to see Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan return at this moment.

Without any dimensional coordinates, he had been forced to return the same way that he had left. This was the rule of the Void, and this was something that even Seventh Tier elites couldn’t overcome.

“Where is he?” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate asked.

“That brat has the ability to travel between dimensions… He’s fled,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan replied.

‘What?!’

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate faltered upon hearing this. He then howled in boundless rage.

Boom!

His roar materialized into something tangible, its power so great that even the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates felt pain in their chest, making them want to vomit blood.

Meanwhile, blood flowed from all orifices of the Heavenly Venerates who were under the Sixth Tier. This was a harrowing sight.

This was the terrifying might of a Seventh Tier elite.

However, everyone shook their head inwardly. It was understandable why the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate was so furious. His doppelganger had been destroyed in front of so many people, so how could he not go wild with rage?

He had then come to kill Ling Han, yet he hadn’t even been able to catch a glimpse of this insolent brat. Unable to vent his boiling anger, it was only natural that he bellowed to express his rage. However, he was a supremely powerful Seventh Tier elite, so his bellows were truly difficult to endure for the others. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Give chase! Immediately look for him!” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said coldly. “We definitely have to find this traitor! I’m going to kill him with my own hands!”

“Understood!” everyone replied. They had no option but to comply. After all, this was a Seventh Tier elite whose words were more powerful than the heavens.

“Aaah!!!” Still unable to suppress his rage, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate unleashed seven palm strikes toward Hysteria’s army.

Peng!

The enemy encampment was instantly obliterated and flattened.

Only then did he turn around to leave.

Whoosh!

He returned to the main battlefield.

Everyone was left speechless after witnessing the profound might of a Seventh Tier elite. Only after a long while did they start to discuss this with spirit.

“So a Seventh Tier elite is actually this powerful!”

“Why don’t they send a Seventh Tier elite over here? If we have such a powerful elite, won’t this place become impregnable?”

“You’re getting too ahead of yourself. Even though Seventh Tier elites won’t be suppressed by this dimension, their presence and power are so great that they’ll end up causing damage to the dimension. No matter how many enemies they kill, they’ll still end up providing more help to the enemy, thereby accelerating the advance of Hysteria.

“Moreover, the most important battlefield is the main battlefield. If they fail to obstruct Hysteria and allow it to charge over… the destruction of the Flaming Frost Realm will be imminent.”

“Then… should we look for Ling Han?”

“Heh, can you defeat Ling Han?”

“No…”

“Then there’s your answer. Whoever can defeat him can go and look for him. What’s the point of us going? To seek death?”

The task of looking for Ling Han could only be handed to the Sixth Tier elites. Otherwise, the others wouldn’t be able to make it back alive with the news even if they managed to find him. Of course, this was assuming that Ling Han was truly Hysteria’s subordinate.

The problem was: if they didn’t think that Ling Han was Hysteria’s subordinate, who would go and look for him?

Thus, this task could only be left to the Sixth Tier elites.

Xin Qihu turned around, and said, “You guys stay here. I’m going to look for Ling Han.”

“I’ll go as well,” Feng Wuding hurriedly said.

“No, we need three people to stay here,” Xin Qihu said, rejecting his request.

Feng Wuding still wanted to speak. However, he knew that he was weaker than Xin Qihu, so if only one of the four could go, Xin Qihu would naturally be more suitable.

Lin Youlian and Wu Haoyang didn’t oppose him. They didn’t want to become enemies with Ling Han, and they more so didn’t believe that he had betrayed the Genesis World. Thus, they naturally wouldn’t volunteer to go.

Xin Qihu set off, leaving the Realm Battlefield and heading to the Genesis World of the last era. He was certain that this was Ling Han’s destination.

Putting himself in Ling Han’s shoes, this would definitely be the best place to hide and bide his time.

***

Ling Han tore open the void, and returned to the Genesis World.

This was the Profound Negative Realm, and he was going to look for his son and daughter first. He was going to ask for their opinions.

However, both Ling Xi and Ling Jianxue wanted to stay in the Profound Negative Realm. They wanted to continue their role of expanding its territory.

“Then be careful,” Ling Han said with a nod. He respected his children’s decision. Moreover, there were also Lin Luo, Zhou Heng, and the others to watch over them, so his children wouldn’t be implicated because of him.

Ling Han left with the Empress and Hu Niu, heading directly to the Genesis World of the last era. This time, he wanted to raise his battle prowess to the Seventh Tier or perhaps even stronger. He would then return for vengeance.
