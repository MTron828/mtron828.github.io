However, two hours later, Hu Niu used a third seventh-grade seal.

Over the years, how many raw stones had Ling Han and the others cut open?

Although only a small portion of them revealed Heavenly Venerable Seals, and most of them were handed over to Ling Han, the Empress and Hu Niu still received a few.

“How could this be?” At a mountain peak very far away, Fei Baizhu frowned.

According to his plan, Hu Niu and the Empress should be defeated very soon, and he would appear in time to save the two women. Although saving a damsel in distress was an old trick, it was a trick that never failed.

But now, although the beauties were in danger, it seemed that they could solve it themselves. How could he then proceed to save them?

‘Forget it, let’s stick to the plan.’ 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

With a leap, he appeared at the edge of the battle area.

“Crimson Emperor, White Demon, can you please give me some face and stop?” he asked.

The red-robed and white-haired duo stopped as instructed, but the Empress and Hu Niu didn’t. One continued to attack the two Third Tiers, while the other continued to focus a wild offensive on the red-robed and white-robed duo.

In this way, the two Third Tiers could only continue fleeing, and the red-robed and white-haired men also had to face Hu Niu, or else they would be equivalent to raising their heads to simply accept death.

Fei Baizhu’s expression was ugly. He actually couldn’t persuade them?

What would happen to his pride?

“Celestial Maidens, this is all a misunderstanding,” he said. “Crimson Emperor and White Demon are both capable members of our alliance, and they are here on my father’s orders to chase off all other uninvolved persons. As long as the two of you join our alliance, you will naturally not be subjected to such restrictions.”

Hu Niu giggled. “Fei Bai Pig, you intentionally commanded these people to find trouble with us, and then you took the opportunity to save the damsel in distress, making us look at you in a different light and be grateful to you, right? What a pity; you didn’t think that our power would surpass your imagination!”

Seeing Fei Baizhu’s expression change slightly, she continued, “This trick is too old-fashioned. It has long been seen through by the wise and mighty Niu.”

Fei Baizhu couldn’t help but clench his fists, his heart fluctuating slightly.

“Young Master Fei, these two women have at least seventh-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals on them. It’s extremely likely that they’re even more important than the veins of ore here. I advise you to give up on those silly ideas and capture these two people to extract their Heavenly Venerable Seals from them,” the white-haired Fourth Tier said coldly.

Although he addressed Fei Baizhu as Young Master Fei, there was no respect in his tone. They were both in the Fourth Tier, and his cultivation level was slightly higher. He addressed Fei Baizhu as Young Master Fei naturally because of Fei Baizhu’s father.

That father was a Fifth Tier elite, and even if a hundred Fourth Tier elites were added together, they might not be a match for him.

“That’s right. We pursue the supreme Heavenly Dao, so how can we be distracted by women?” the red-robed Fourth Tier also said.

Fei Baizhu’s expression was ugly. He didn’t want to give up on the Empress and Hu Niu, because, in his opinion, the path of cultivation was long, so if he had such peerless beauties accompanying him, he naturally wouldn’t feel bored or frustrated. However, after hearing what the two of them said, would the two women still follow him?

He was a decisive person as well, and immediately nodded. “Alright!”

He joined the fray, and the three Fourth Tiers exerted their strength together. Hu Niu was instantly embroiled in a dilemma.

Although Fei Baizhu was only an early stage Fourth Tier, he had channeled a seventh-grade seal, and his strength was not inferior to Hu Niu’s. This became a three-on-one battle, giving Hu Niu immense pressure.

“Wah, shameless! Three against one!” Hu Niu cried out loudly, but gritted her teeth and refused to retreat.

It was easy for her to retreat, but what about the Empress?

Although the two women fought frequently, they were both members of the Ling Clan. How could they watch the other fall into enemy hands?

“Retreat,” the Empress said. She approached Hu Niu.

“Hehe, if we can let you two escape, then we don’t need to live anymore!” the red-robed Fourth Tier said. He forcefully suppressed them, and another two hours passed. Hu Niu finally didn’t have a fourth seventh-grade seal to channel, and her battle prowess plummeted.

“Shameless woman, what other ideas do you have?” Hu Niu shouted at the Empress.

The Empress shrugged, indicating that there was nothing she could do, either.

“Then we can only call Ling Han out,” Hu Niu shouted loudly. “Ling Han, quickly come and save me!”

“You still want to call for help?” The white-haired Fourth Tier sneered. “At this time, no one can save you!”

“Oh, what makes you so sure?” Xiu! With a flash, Ling Han had already appeared.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu shouted happily. She didn’t care what kind of time or place this was, and immediately jumped onto Ling Han, giving him a bear hug.

Although Fei Baizhu had already given up on the two women, seeing Hu Niu and Ling Han being so intimate, his expression still couldn’t help but change. He snorted coldly, and said, “Just a puny Second Tier.” His tone was filled with disdain.

White Hair and Red Robe also laughed loudly. What utter nonsense; they had thought that some super elite would be called out, but it was actually just a Second Tier.

What could a Second Tier do?

Ling Han stared at Fei Baizhu. “You dare to have designs on my wives?”

“What are you—”

Before Fei Baizhu could finish speaking, Ling Han had already charged over, and threw a punch.

This punch was so fast!

Although Fei Baizhu was slightly shocked, he didn’t care at all. So what if Ling Han was fast? He was only a Second Tier.

Fei Baizhu delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han. At this moment, he had already channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and his battle prowess was currently at its peak, reaching middle-stage Fourth Tier, which could be considered to be incomparably terrifying.

Peng!

As the punch landed on him, Fei Baizhu’s entire body trembled as he spat out a mist of blood.

“Young Master Fei!” The white-haired man and the red-robed man were both shocked. Why was it that not only did Fei Baizhu not kill Ling Han with a single palm strike, he was even slightly injured?

However, Fei Baizhu didn’t answer them. He just stood there.

The two were shocked. What was going on?

However, Ling Han paid no more attention to Fei Baizhu, and strode towards the red-robed man and the white-haired man. There was a seal glowing on his body, and although there was only one, it exuded a domineering aura that suppressed all the Heavenly Dao in the world.

This was because this was a first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal.

“What kind of Heavenly Venerable Seal is this?”

“It’s too terrifying. It seems to have surpassed everything.”

...

The red-robed man and the white-haired man cried out in surprise. They even forgot to be concerned about Fei Baizhu’s current situation.

Ling Han let out a long cry, and punched out. Boundless power surged, and the nearby mountain peaks collapsed one by one, while the sky trembled violently, collapsing in large patches.

Only then did the red-robed man and the white-haired man become horrified. Previously, they were only shocked that Ling Han could stand against Fei Baizhu, but now that they were personally facing Ling Han, they finally understood what kind of pressure this was.

They hurriedly released their strongest battle prowess, and went forth to meet Ling Han’s attack.

Peng!

However, with only a single strike, they felt as if they had suffered a terrifying blow, and all the veins and bones in their bodies were instantly broken apart.

They were shocked. A Second Tier had dealt them such a heavy blow with just one punch, and they had completely lost any ability to continue fighting.

Was he still human?

Ling Han was astounded. “They actually didn’t die?” In his opinion, these two people should have died with a single punch.

Boom! In response to this, Fei Baizhu’s body suddenly exploded, turning into an endless rain of blood.

He had been killed by Ling Han in a single strike, and had only exploded at this moment.

...
