3124 Treasure Seizing

Li Changdan had originally thought that he was invincible among the younger generation, but after exchanging a blow with Ling Han, tempestuous waves surged in his heart.

How was this possible?

With the suppression by nearly two meridians of cultivation, coupled with the fact that he was already stronger than most people, his current strength was around 6,000 kg—from the suppression of his cultivation level, it could be seen that Ling Han’s cultivation level should be at Four Meridians.

The power of the Four Meridians was only about 1,750 kg, yet Ling Han’s strength was as high as 5,000 kg. How terrifying was this?

Hiss!

Li Changdan felt numb with shock, while at the same time, boundless killing intent surged within him.

Such a person… had to be eliminated. Otherwise, Li Changdan wouldn’t be able to eat or sleep in peace.

“Junior Brother Ling, let me teach you how to fight!” He charged over and struck out with his palm. It appeared to be a light strike, but actually carried a strong sound of rushing wind, indicating that the destructive power of this palm strike was actually very terrifying.

He had a rare treasure that could negate the suppression of the formations within a short range. Thus, he broke through the fog, and charged murderously towards Ling Han.

It was only a mere 12 steps.

A raging fighting spirit appeared on Ling Han’s face as he charged forward.

Xiu, his figure was agile like a highly spirited monkey. This was indeed the Demonic Monkey Fists.

Li Changdan’s palm landed on thin air.

Ling Han’s fist smashed over from an extremely tricky angle, completely exceeding his expectations.

This was not the Four Directional Fists.

Peng!

Just as this thought flashed through his mind, he was punched in the left shoulder. A piercing pain assaulted him, causing him to grunt and stagger back.

This was only because he had dodged in time. Otherwise, this punch would have landed on his chest.

What a terrifying fist technique. Why was it even more powerful than the style of Four Directional Fists that he had learned?

“What fist technique is this?” He couldn’t hide his shock.

“Dog Fist!” Ling Han laughed, and once again closed in, throwing a punch.

His punches were tricky and domineering, causing Li Changdan to be hit repeatedly. He was in extreme pain.

He was no longer as calm as before, and his neat hair had become disheveled. He no longer had the slightest trace of elegance.

This top genius of the Ancient Dao Sect was actually so weak?

It wasn’t that Li Changdan was too weak, but that Ling Han was too freakish.

In this era, who had obtained an inheritance of cultivation technique?

Perhaps there was some, but it was definitely pitifully little. At the very least, Li Changdan didn’t have it. Meanwhile, with the tempering from the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, Ling Han’s power was incomparably pure. He also possessed 5,000 kilograms of power, but his destructive power was greater than others’.

Coupled with the Demonic Monkey Fists, which might be a secret technique from the golden age of ancient martial arts, it naturally far surpassed the Four Directional Fists and the Four Splitting Snowflake Palm.

Furthermore, Ling Han’s state of mind as an ultimate elite was something that Li Changdan could never compare to.

With so many factors added together, even if Li Changdan had the cultivation level advantage by two Meridians, it would be useless. He could only passively take a beating.

However, compared to Rui Yuanliang, he was much more durable. At the very least, he could still hold on for now, unlike Rui Yuanliang, who had been defeated with just a kick from Ling Han.

Li Changdan was no match for Ling Han, and had the intention to retreat. If he continued to fight, he would only be humiliating himself.

As long as he left this great formation, he would have a crushing advantage in terms of power, and would definitely be able to find an opportunity to eliminate Ling Han.

He had to get rid of him. This guy was too freakish.

He pretended to make a move before he turned to run.

Peng, he unleashed his power, and kicked out at an extremely fast speed.

Right now, none of them had mastered any movement techniques, so speed was basically dependent on power. With this burst of power, he instantly disappeared into the fog.

However, Ling Han was not nervous at all, nor did he chase after them. Instead, he clasped his hands behind his back and counted, “One, two, three…”

He had only counted to nine when he saw a black shadow coming toward him.

Li Changdan!

“You’re back?” Ling Han laughed loudly, and his right fist had already struck out.

This was a psychedelic great formation. Although Li Changdan possessed a rare treasure that could break through the formation with certain limitations, that rare treasure wouldn’t be able to take effect in time when he was running so quickly just now.

Thus, even though he was clearly walking forward, he had actually made a detour and ran right in front of Ling Han.

What?!

Peng, Ling Han kicked out, hitting right between Li Changdan’s legs.

“Oh!” Li Changdan had already cultivated his physical body to an extremely powerful state, yet no matter how much he cultivated, he couldn’t cultivate that place as well. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

His entire body bowed, and his face turned so pale that there was no trace of blood circulation. He swayed back and forth on his tiptoes, as if a mere light push would cause him to tip over and fall to the ground.

Ling Han shook his head. If Li Changdan was placed in the Genesis World, he would be far from a prodigy. He could only be said to be… slightly stronger than ordinary people.

This world had just started, after all, and there was a limited number of cultivators. Moreover, in such a small place like the Ancient Dao Sect, it was normal that no true prodigy had appeared.

Ling Han instantly felt a sense of boredom. He had originally thought that he could trample on a prodigy, but who would have thought that this one would only be slightly better than mediocrity, disappointing him.

“Boring!” He shook his head.

Li Changdan really wanted to curse. You beat him up so badly, and yet you still said that it was boring?

He was the number one genius of the Ancient Dao Sect. Having defeated him, how glorious would that be?

What a huge humiliation!

However, Li Changdan couldn’t even open his mouth. Now, he deeply understood what it meant to have a pain in the nuts, and this was really fatal.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and tore open Li Changdan’s collar with a rip. A purple pendant hung from his chest, and he wore it with a thread.

Ling Han reached out and pulled at it. The thread broke, and the pendant fell into his hand.

“R-r-return…” Li Changdan barely said, but the words “it to me” couldn’t be uttered at all.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Senior Brother is really stingy. Isn’t it just a pendant carved from a piece of broken wood? What’s our relationship for you to be fussing over this with me?” He put his arm around Li Changdan’s shoulder, as if they were good friends.

Li Changdan reached out with a trembling hand, but the pain coming from his lower body was too intense. He felt as if just stretching out his hand had caused a tug on his balls, and it was so painful that he was about to cry.

How was this a pendant carved out of broken wood? It was a rare treasure he had obtained from an ancient site that could suppress formations.

Now that ancient sites were appearing one after another in this world, all of them were protected by formations. Thus, how practical was this pendant?

It was extremely precious!
