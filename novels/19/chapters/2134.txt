Chapter 2135: Xiao Gu was also good at attracting animosity

“Yiyaya!” A familiar call rang out, and a streak of light rapidly shot over.

Old Qian was stunned, and had not even come back to his wits when?peng, this streak of light had already crashed into his back. He was instantly harshly slammed into the ground, landing solidly.

The speed of the light streak also decreased, and everyone could see it clearly. This was actually a snow-white bone.

The bone floated in midair entwined by threads of light, slowly taking human form.

Who else could it be but Xiao Gu?

“Yiyaya!” When Xiao Gu spotted Ling Han, he appeared very elated.

“Pretty girl, give me a smile!

“Milord, don’t do anything foolish.

“Wife, our hoe should be sent for repair.

“…”

Xiao Gu immediately began chattering and mimicking word after word, with completely no sign of stopping any time soon.

Everyone was watching in shock, dumbfounded. This bone had come in such an astonishing manner, but what was it actually blurting out now?

Meanwhile, Ling Han laughed loudly. For these 10,000 years, who knew how many conversations Xiao Gu had listened in on. He was naturally feeling very suffocated, so how could he be satisfied without mimicking to his heart’s content?

“Xiao Gu, help me escape,” he said.

“Xiao Gu, help me escape,” Xiao Gu said as well, his expression completely serious.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han sighed plaintively. Thos Xiao Gu was always undependable when it came to crucial moments.

“Humph, since you are already here, then both of you should stay behind.” An Ascending Origin Tier moved, grabbing at both Ling Han and Xiao Gu.

“Humph, since you are already here…” Xiao Gu copied the words, stretching out his hand as well, and grabbing out at the other.

Peng!

The two hands crashed into each other, and the light of Regulations exploded. The large hand that Xiao Gu had extended burst through the other’s large hand on an unstoppable course, continuing the course to grab ahead. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not good!” that Ascending Origin Tier exclaimed in shock, and hurriedly turned around and fled.

“Not good!” Xiao Gu did not realize that he was presently fighting another person at all. He, too, exclaimed in shock, and turned and fled.

This…

Everyone watched this happen, their faces twitching madly.

How could he play around with someone like that? That was going too far.

That Ascending Origin Tier wanted to throw up blood in his fury. ‘If I can’t match you, it would be due to my inferior strength, but you actually copy the way that I flee. What kind of horrible humiliation is that to me?’

This could not be tolerated! It was unacceptable!

Ling Han rubbed his chin. Xiao Gu was clearly adorably dumb, but why could he instantly infuriate others to the extent that they would be hopping mad? If it had been the large black dog, that would have been logical. It was extraordinarily despicable by nature, and it would be nothing strange even if it managed to drive a Celestial King to death with fury.

“Fang Tang, step back.” A figure descended from the skies, enshrouded in extraordinary light.

A Celestial King!

That Ascending Origin Tier hurriedly paid his greetings respectfully, and stepped aside.

A Celestial King, no matter which Heaven they were at, was still a supreme being. Anyone who had not reached this level could only treat them with utter respect.

That Celestial King looked at Xiao Gu, and revealed an expression of shock. It was clearly only a bone, but why would it have such might?

When a Celestial King acted, they naturally had no reservations. Stretching out his hand, he grabbed out at Xiao Gu.

Xiao Gu was in high spirits. With so many people playing with him, this was fun!

He also stretched out his hand, copying the other’s movement.

“Humph!” THat Celestial King showed a hint of displeasure. ‘I am a Second Heaven Celestial King, and you think I am just any random minor character?’

Peng!

The two hands crashed into one another, and one of them immediately crumbled.

Unexpectedly, the hand that was shattered was actually the one that had been sent out by that Celestial King!

Boom, the large hand that Xiao Gu sent out continued to grab out at that Celestial King.

“What!?” that Celestial King exclaimed in shock, and hurriedly turned and fled.

“What!?” Xiao Gu imitated him to perfection, and also turned around and fled.

This….

Everyone’s cheek was twitching. They felt that Xiao Gu was really too insulting.

‘It’s enough that you won, so why do you have to go so far?’

They were both Celestial Kings, and had cultivated to this kind of height, so how could they be so tasteless?

“Y-y-you…” That Celestial King had already turned around, fuming mad with fury.

“Y-y-you…” Xiao Gu also bared his teeth, copying him to absolute perfection.

This was too far, this was really going too far!

To say nothing of the fact that the Celestial King wanted to commit murder, even the others were shaking their heads continuously. How could he do that?

“I, Liu Feng, swear that we cannot exist together!” that Celestial King roared furiously, his expression twisted in anger.

Men could be killed, but couldn’t be insulted. A Celestial King was noble and proud, standing equal to heaven and earth, so how could they be allowed to be slighted?

“I, Liu Feng, swear that we cannot exist together!” Xiao Gu’s expression was similarly twisted, and he was practically howling with fury.

By now, he had improved further. Not only could he mimic words, he would also add in some input of expression, appearing to be even more exaggerated.

Everyone was about to pass out. Not only were you mimicking others as mockery, you were even stealing their names. This would mean a deadly feud.

“Liu Feng!” Another elite descended from the skies. Five-colored light enshrouded him, representing that he was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King.

“Lord Wu Heng!” The Celestial King from before hurriedly greeted him respectfully. There were a total of three Heavens between the two of them. He needed to maintain an attitude of absolute respect.

Wu Heng nodded. His expression was slightly solemn. “You are no match for this person.”

Liu Feng was a little defiant. Though he had fallen into a disadvantage in the previous clash, he still had a very strong confidence that if he went all out in battle, it would not be certain that he would lose. However, Wu Heng actually determined that he was no match for Xiao Gu so decisively, which made him feel very defiant.

He stepped back, giving way to Wu Heng.

“Sir, you are really outrageously bold, to dare to interfere even in the matters of our Four Seas Palace!” Wu Heng said menacingly.

“Sir, you are really…” Xiao Gu was extremely happy, mimicking as he liked, and driving others mad with fury.

Wu Heng’s expression involuntarily darkened. “You are a Celestial King yourself, so what is so fun about mimicking others like this?”

“You are a…” Xiao Gu’s expression darkened even further, looking completely livid.

“Damn you!” Wu Heng was furious. With a soft exclamation, he moved.?Boom, endless immortal flames burned brightly and ferociously. He sent out a punch, an ancient seal of great dao on his fist as the blow headed to suppress Xiao Gu.

“Damn you!” Xiao Gu similarly looked like he had flown into a fury, and approached in anger.

Boom!

Because Xiao Gu was copying completely, their two fists naturally crashed into one another, generating a world-shaking?boom. Celestial light surged out as if the heaven and earth were being split apart, evolving into millions of worlds.

Boom, Wu Heng was sent flying from the force while drawing out an arc in the skies, blood spraying madly from his whole body.

When Xiao Gu saw this, he made an ah, and also rolled backwards, forcing out blood to pour from his body. However, his body itself had been copied, so to say nothing of just bleeding a little, he would be fine even if he was beheaded.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel speechless. They had never seen someone so despicable.

Ling Han was feeling gratified, though. Xiao Gu was no longer just simply mimicking, but had already inserted some of his own performing skills. For example, in that exclamation of “ah”, Wu Heng had not released such a pained cry. It was added in by Xiao Gu himself.

There was improvement!

Who knew, endless years later, Xiao Gu could possibly awaken his intelligence a second time, and ascend Dao once more.

Meanwhile, Liu Feng’s expression was filled with grief. He now knew that Wu Heng had not seen wrongly. He really was no match for Xiao Gu.

…Even a Fifth Heaven Celestial King had been sent flying. Even if the strength of both sides was close to equal, suppressing him would only be the matter of a few moves.

What was more terrifying was that this perhaps wasn’t even Xiao Gu’s full strength.

Sixth Heaven? Seventh Heaven? Eighth Heaven? Or even… a supreme being of Ninth Heaven?

Xiu, another Celestial King descended, seven-colored light entwined around him. His whole body was also brimming with the air of Primal Chaos. His features could not be distinguished clearly, but the pressure that came from a supreme being was rippling out.

Seventh Heaven Celestial King!
