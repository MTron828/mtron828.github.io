Chapter 2539: Opening the doors

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han, the Empress, and the large black dog all ingested the alchemical pills, but Wally did not need to. He was not an actual living being, so this kind of poison had no effect on him at all.

Everyone naturally had their own ways to determine the true nature of alchemical pills. Very quickly, they ingested that antidote pill.

They continued onwards. There were no other living creatures here. It was a completely barren, desolate place.

No one spoke, and with Gu Heyi and the others taking the lead, they soon arrived at the end of the valley. There were a set of great doors here, embedded in the cliff walls.

“Can’t we just blast apart the cliff walls directly?” someone asked. Clearly, only the great doors required the lifeblood of supreme monarch stars to open, but how could these cliff walls manage to withstand the great might of multiple Celestial Kings?

Did you think that the power of Heavenly Venerable Tier could be seen just anywhere?

Miao Hua shook his head. “The ancient site is not constructed inside the mountain itself. These doors are akin to a Transference Portal, which connects to a separate dimension.”

Everyone nodded. If so, it couldn’t be helped; they could only enter through the doorway.

They all walked towards the great doors, and then slit open a finger before they rubbed their blood onto the great doors.

As streak after streak of blood appeared on the great doors, peculiar light flickered on the latter, and very soon, it could be seen that the doors were actually becoming transparent.

As it turned out, the doors were not opened, but would rather become transparent, and then disappear completely.

Every single person had given up some blood, but the great doors still had not completely disappeared. There was still only just a slight layer, merely a slight sliver left.

“If there was just a little bit more blood, the doors would disappear,” Gu Heyi said.

“Then, I’ll contribute a bit more,” Liu Hao said.

Miao Hua shook his head. “It’s useless. A single person can only contribute once. It is the same even if you give up a bigger amount.”

Everyone thought about it, and nodded subsequently. If that had not been the case, there would not have been a need to get so many of them at all. One person could just slowly contribute more and more blood. It was not blood essence, after all.

“Then what do we do?” Everyone frowned. They had initially thought that there were already enough of them, but it actually turned out that they still needed one more.

Just return like this?

They were dissatisfied with this, but what could they do?

“I think… I can be of some help.” At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out.

Everyone was stunned as they all turned, looking towards their right.

From behind a massive boulder, a voluptuous, shapely beauty walked out. She was very tall, and did not appear inferior to even men. Her fair neck was slender, white as snow, and smooth like the neck of a swan, noble and graceful.

And her shapely, well-proportioned figure was very enchanting. With a moon-white skintight dress outlining her shape, every single curve was capable of making hearts pound and shake.

Five streaks of peculiar light were wrapped around her, which clearly indicated that she was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King.

“Who are you, Miss?” Gu Heyi asked solemnly. Though this female Celestial King was astonishingly beautiful, how could he be enchanted so easily?

Most importantly, there was an Empress whose beauty reigned supreme over eras here. Having been accustomed to seeing this kind of beauty, would Gu Heyi still be enchanted by any other beauty?

This female Celestial King appeared slightly surprised. She was filled with confidence in her own charisma, but Gu Heyi was actually so calm and solemn in front of her, and this was slightly unacceptable to her.

However, there was naturally no chance that she would be so obvious, and exhibit all her thoughts on her face. Smiling, she said, “My name is Liu Yufei, and just like all of you, I wish to enter this historical site. I just had not expected that it could only be opened with the lifeblood of so many supreme monarch stars.”

“How do you know about this place?” Xiao Yingxiong questioned.

“Are you a supreme monarch star as well?” Luo Yangqiu asked.

Liu Yufei was all smiles. “Let me answer your questions in order. Firstly, I am a supreme monarch star, of course. Otherwise, why would I say that I can be of help to all of you? Secondly, the fact that Lord He Feng failed to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and died as a result, is really no big secret. Anyone who wanted to naturally would be able to find clues about this from ancient records, thus deducing the location of his celestial abode.”

The original owner of this abode was Celestial King He Feng.

Was that all?

Everyone exchanged a look. Naturally, they could not possibly trust her so easily. However, there were two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings among their group, and the majority of the others were all Sixth Heaven supreme monarch stars. How could they possibly be afraid of her?

“I only wish to obtain the great opportunity with everyone. I am sure that you all would not mind an additional member. After all, opening the great doors would need so many people, and most importantly, the priority is to obtain the personal notes of Celestial King He Feng about his breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Everyone would be able to make their own copy,” Liu Yufei said very persuasively.

These words were indeed very reasonable. Everyone was perfectly capable of copying the notebook of a Celestial King. It was not like other natural treasures, where an additional person would mean a smaller share for the rest.

“We welcome you.” Gu Heyi issued an invitation to Liu Yufei on behalf of everyone after he had swept an eye over everyone’s expression, and saw that the majority were nodding.

Liu Yufei stepped forwards delicately, graceful and enchanting in bearing. If the Empress was not here, she would definitely be filled with a fatal attraction. Even the hearts of Celestial Kings would pound wildly for her. Unfortunately, her charisma had greatly declined due to being compared with the Empress.

She took a second look at the Empress. Even her heart was beating wildly at such exquisite beauty.

Arriving at the great doors, she slit open a finger, and let out a few drops of blood. Instantly, the great doors that had originally been close to becoming transparent immediately faded completely, revealing an inky black passageway.

As expected, she, too, was a supreme monarch star.

Everyone was surprised. It was naturally an easy matter for supreme monarch stars to enroll in the martial academy, but why had this woman not entered the World’s Paramount Martial Academy?

But it was also possible that she was actually also a disciple of the martial academy, but had always maintained a low profile, so there were not many that knew of her existence.

No one asked anything. Everyone had their own secrets, and it was not appropriate to ask such questions so rashly.

“Let’s go!”

All of them were talented and bold, and they set foot in the passageway one after another.

When they had all entered, the great doors solidified again from their previous transparent state, and very quickly regained their original look.

Three days later, a man strode over, nine streaks of peculiar light wrapped around him.

“Liu Yufei, do you think that just because you have stolen my token, I will not be able to enter here?” this man sneered coldly. “I have treated you so well, yet your only goal was the secret teachings and Heavenly Venerable Tier insights of the ancestor of our He Clan. I will definitely make you pay a price for your actions!”

He stretched out a hand and drew a line on his palm. Blood dripped on the great doors. These doors that required the lifeblood of a great many supreme monarch stars to open suddenly became transparent and opened easily.

“I am a descendant of the He Clan. By nature, my bloodline can open the doors to this abode. However…”

This Celestial King looked at the dark, eerie passageway. It was like a colossal mouth that would devour every single person that entered.

“It’s about time. Though Ancestor has passed away, he had other arrangements in place. He used his blood essence to nurture the United Origin Manifestation Fruit, and only with the Celestial King blood of over a dozen supreme monarch stars to irrigate it could it ripen completely.

“Liu Yufei, you thought that you had hoaxed me into revealing the information regarding the United Origin Manifestation Fruit, yet had completely no idea that this was my deliberate test for you as well. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“If you had been completely sincere towards me, I naturally would not have treated you unfairly, yet you chose to betray me. In that case, you should contribute all your blood essence, and help me to take that final step then.

“This is the treasure of our He Clan, and only the He Clan can obtain such a great opportunity. No one can possibly take it away from me!”

This Celestial King strode out, entering into the passageway. Behind him, the great doors closed back up again. One after another, streaks of blood flowed, and actually just happened to form the image of a demonic face, which was baring its mouth in a chilling, terrifying grin.
