Chapter 2130: Love Triangle

Shang Zhiwei’s eyes swept over the spot. There was nothing in this world that could be hidden in front of her.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King, from a certain aspect, was the manifestation of the Regulations of heaven and earth, and could see through the essence of the heaven and earth.

Her eyes focused on a single point, the expression on her face suddenly becoming excited. In fact, even her hands were trembling.

Shua,?right at this moment, a large hand suddenly stretched out, directly scooped up that area, and then rapidly retreated into the depths of the mountains.

If Shang Zhiwei had not been so excited that her mind had suddenly gone blank, there would’ve been absolutely no possibility that this large hand could have succeeded so easily. But now, it had caught her completely off guard.

“Long, Yue, Xi!” Shang Zhiwei flew into a thunderous rage abruptly, all her black locks raised skywards.?Boom, nine seals appeared on her body, each seal exuding a might that domineered the world.

She was extraordinarily furious, as if she had become a demon. Her figure suddenly shot out as she set off in pursuit of the large hand.

Peng!

However, she had only pursued it for over 1,000 miles when a shield of light blocked her from advancing further. Even if she was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so what? She had still stumbled back from the impact of her crash.

“He is Yuan Sheng’s heir!” Shang Zhiwei roared in fury. “Long Yuexi, give him back to me!”

“Give back your head!” The old woman’s, Long Yuexi’s, aged voice rang out. “Shang Zhiwei, you have already lost in the past, so what is the point of you so earnestly struggling now? Now, both Yi Yun and Yuan Sheng have long since died, so what else can you not let go of?”

“Without destroying the Roc Palace, I will not be able to let it go!” Shang Zhiwei declared harshly. “As long as you and the brand of that b*tch are still alive, I will definitely not give up!”

“Attention to all members of the Roc Palace!” She suddenly calmed down, her expression frighteningly cold. “Whoever unlocks the formation for me, and allows me entry, I can appoint her as the vice imperial empress of the Four Seas Palace.

“Additionally, I only want the lives of two people. One is Long Yuexi, and the second is Tianyun. As long as the others do not resist, I can leave you alone. In fact, it is also possible for you to join the Four Seas Palace.”

After these words were out, a wave of commotion swept through both the Four Seas Palace and Roc Palace.

Previously, Shang Zhiwei had clearly shown that she wanted to slaughter every single member of the Roc Palace. Surrender? She did not accept it. As long as they bore the name of the Roc Palace, she would kill all of them. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yet now, a complete reversal of her attitude had actually taken place. She only wanted the lives of Long Yuexi and Hu Niu. This was practically… She had gone mad.

But when a Ninth Heaven Celestial King made a promise in public, it was like the heavens were speaking. They would live up to their word, or they would be abandoned by the Dao of Heaven and Earth, their battle prowess dropping greatly.

Which also meant that this promise from Shang Zhiwei was absolutely true.

Why?

The only thing that had changed was that she had suddenly discovered Ling Han’s identity. He was the heir of some guy called Yuan Sheng.

What relationship did she have with this Yuan Sheng?

At this moment, the people of both palaces were both stunned and curious.

This was the gossip of a, no, of three Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

“In your dreams!” Long Yuexi declared coldly. “Don’t forget. This Great Protective Formation has been personally laid down by Yuan Sheng. Even after millions and millions of epochs, it would still exist for eternity, protecting our Roc Palace.”

“Hehe!” Shang Zhiwei did not answer, and merely responded with a cold smirk. She had completely gotten her emotions back under control.

With a flick of her sleeves, she turned and left.

In the Roc Heaven, Long Yuexi’s aged face showed a solemn expression. Previously, Shang Zhiwei had been extremely patient, wanting to slowly dry up the source of power of the Roc Heaven, and sever the Roc Palace’s foundations. Then, even if they had a supreme protective formation sheltering, the Roc Palace would still become a pool of stagnant water, deteriorating from the inside out.

But now that she had found out who Ling Han was, her patience had also instantly disappeared completely.

Sigh, why had Ling Han come now with such a coincidental timing?

With a flash, Ling Han exited the Black Tower.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu pounced over, and hung on Ling Han like a koala.

Ling Han patted the little girl’s head, and said, “Where are the others? Are they all right?”

“Stupid Ling Han, you only care about other people. You don’t care about Niu!” Hu Niu complained, biting Ling Han’s neck.

“The others are perfectly fine,” Long Yuexi continued, and then shook her head. “Sigh, what an ill-fated relationship!”

“Senior, exactly what is behind all this?” Ling Han asked. Though he was inside the Black Tower, he had still heard the exchange between Shang Zhiwei and Long Yuexi. It seemed that the feud between the Four Seas Palace and Roc Palace was not because of contesting over territory, but had rather originated from a romantic conflict.

Long Yuexi sighed a few times again, and then said, “All right then. SInce you managed to enter the Roc Palace all by yourself, which has proven your strength, as well as proven your good fortune, I will tell you.

“In the past, Shang Zhiwei, Tianyun, and Yuan Sheng had both fought alongside each other, grown together, and were very close with one another.

“Tianyun is the last Imperial Empress of the Roc Heaven, and she is also Yi Yun—”

“It’s Hu Niu!” Hu Niu interrupted her in irritation. She had never accepted the name of Yi Yun.

Long Yuexi smiled, and then said, “Hu Niu’s body contains the martial brand that was left behind by Tianyun. She will be able to inherit Tianyun’s martial foundations in the future. Perhaps she may even be able to exceed Tianyun’s limits, and step onto a completely new height.”

“Heavenly Venerable Tier!” Ling Han continued.

Long Yuexi nodded. “Yuan Sheng is the master that you have never met, but you have cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and thus you are his true disciple. Yuan Sheng is supremely talented, and was the strongest prodigy of that era.

“Both Shang Zhiwei and Tianyun fell in love with Yuan Sheng, and Yuan Sheng ultimately chose Tianyun, causing Shang Zhiwei to feel resentment. Not only did she become enemies with Tianyun, she has also attacked Tianyun repeatedly.

“However, Yuan Sheng ultimately successfully became a Heavenly Venerate, and no matter what Shang Zhiwei tried, it would only be wasted effort. For the sake of their previous relations, Yuan Sheng didn’t do anything to Shang Zhiwei, either.

“However, following Yuan Sheng’s death, Shang Zhiwei also became very extremist, and thought that it was Tianyun who had caused Yuan Sheng’s death. She suddenly delivered a fatal strike when Tianyun had sustained injuries in the resistance against the storm of darkness and returned, ultimately leading to Tianyun’s death.

“She also wanted to destroy the Roc Palace, but thankfully, with the powerful formation laid down by Yuan Sheng, she was not able to take one step over the boundaries.

“I, too, have sustained fatal Dao injuries in the resistance against the force of darkness, but for the sake of the juniors of this Palace, I can only struggle and keep holding on. When Yi— Hu Niu matures, I will then be able to leave with an easy heart.”

As it turned out, it was a love triangle. Love had turned to hatred, and caused very good sisters to turn hostile against one another and become enemies.

It was a little cliche. A great and noble Ninth Heaven Celestial King had actually died because of this. It was a little wasted.

“Senior, how did Senior Yuan Sheng die?” Ling Han asked.

That was a Heavenly Venerate, already superior over Heavenly Dao itself, so why had he still died?

“I am not very sure about that myself, but it involves three supreme existences. Their names cannot be spoken of!” Long Yuexi said solemnly. Even if she was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, she still showed an expression of reverence and fear.

Heavenly Venerate!

Could it be that it was the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the other great supreme elites that had joined forces to kill the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable?

But why?

There was clearly an invasion of the storm of darkness, so they should have been united instead.

If it was claimed that the three great Heavenly Venerates had “turned traitor”, that would be even more impossible. Now, it was just the three of them that were Heavenly Venerates. Wasn’t opening the Two Realm Passageway, and allowing the people of the Foreign Realm to march straight in unchallenged an incredibly simple matter? Who could stop them?

Ling Han realized that though he knew more of the truth, it was practically of little help in solving the mystery.
