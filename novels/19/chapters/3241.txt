3242 Bird King

Peng, with a punch, the spirit-type Demonic Beast was instantly blasted apart.

Ling Han’s punch had 20 overlapping layers of power. How terrifying was that?

He heaved a sigh of relief as a wave of fatigue washed over him.

Fighting with a spirit-type Demonic Beast was not only physically exhausting, but also mentally exhausting. Now that the battle was over, his tightly stretched nerves relaxed, and he wished he could immediately fall asleep.

However, the death of a spirit-type Demonic Beast did not affect the battle at all. The beast tide continued to wreak havoc and slaughter in the city, and the screams of humans were endless.

Houses had collapsed and there were flames everywhere. Was this still Huju City? It was simply hell! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If there were any changes, it would be that the bird of prey had already turned around and flown away, no longer attacking him.

Ling Han frowned. It seemed that there was far more than one spirit-type Demonic Beast. Thus, even if he killed one, it would not affect the overall situation at all.

How was he going to resolve this?

He had almost collapsed from exhaustion after killing a single spirit-type Demonic Beast. If he encountered another one, he would definitely be courting death.

He could only hope that the Extreme Bone Tier elites in the city would show their might.

However, looking at the current situation, the Extreme Bone Tier elites could only protect themselves. At most, they could escort a few people away. It was impossible for the entire city to retreat peacefully.

Besides—

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. He saw a super Demonic Beast with a wingspan of 300 meters. It flew in the sky, and had two snake heads. There was no fur on its wings. Instead, it had leather wings.

It also had a long tail that was about 300 meters long.

Such a huge creature flew in the air like a warship.

It was because of its existence that the aerial power in the city was useless. Any warship would be easily destroyed by its claws. In fact, it could even spit out liquid from its mouth that was full of corrosive power, causing the warship to quickly disintegrate in the air. Of course, everyone on board would then fall to their deaths.

Even if one didn’t fall to his death, he would still be corroded by acid.

This was definitely not a Blood Transformation Tier, but an Extreme Bone Tier!

It could fly in the air, so it could be said that it was innately invincible. Even other Extreme Bone Tier elites could only look at it and sigh helplessly. Could a human be capable of flight?

Other than this bird king, there were many other Demonic Beasts whose sizes were comparable to the giant elephant, and they were all existences in the Blood Transformation Tier. With their huge bodies, they could practically be mobilized as Extreme Bone Tier cultivators.

There were at least 20 of such gigantic Demonic Beasts. After being charged by them, Huju City seemed to have been piled up with sand and rocks, and the city quickly fell apart.

Ling Han sighed. No wonder Zha Deyuan and the little old man were so confident, thinking that Huju City was destined to suffer a tribulation. Indeed, how could the strength of Huju City withstand such a terrifying beast tide?

“Evil creature!” With a loud roar, Feng Zisheng appeared on the top of the tallest building in the city. He held a large bow in his hand. Xiu, a golden cold light shot out towards a great Demonic Beast.

This was the attack of an Extreme Bone Tier elite. With a golden flash, it sank into the eye of a super-large gorilla and flew out from the back of its head.

“Ang!” The giant gorilla let out an enraged roar and rolled on the ground, crushing the houses one by one. Countless Demonic Beasts and humans were also crushed. Most of them were directly turned into meat paste, while a small portion of them did not die and let out miserable cries.

Fortunately, the giant gorilla only struggled on the verge of death and quickly stopped moving.

As expected of an Extreme Bone Tier elite, the number one elite in Huju City. He had killed such a powerful Demonic Beast with a single arrow.

Feng Zisheng used the same trick again and shot another arrow. Xiu, golden light shot out at an extremely fast speed. Just as he was about to kill a super huge hippopotamus, a stream of liquid sprayed over and annihilated the golden light.

In the sky, a cry sounded. The bird king flapped its wings and charged at Feng Zisheng. It was the one who had attacked just now and spat out a stream of acid to resolve Feng Zisheng’s attack.

The two elites engaged in a fierce battle. For a moment, it was hard to tell who was stronger.

However, there were still countless Demonic Beasts in the city. There were close to twenty super large Demonic Beasts alone, as well as a large number of ordinary Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beasts. This was still power that made people despair.

Most importantly, it was unknown how many spirit-type Demonic Beasts there were here. This was the most terrifying.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. He first cut open the spirit-type Demonic Beast and took away the Blood Divine Crystal inside. Then, with a flip of his body, he landed on top of the elephant’s tusks. Then, he shot out a stream of Sword Qi towards the elephant’s eye. Pu, the Sword Qi was indestructible. One of the elephant’s eyes immediately exploded, and a large amount of liquid sprayed out.

Ling Han slashed again, blinding the other eye of the giant elephant, but he could only do this much now. The giant elephant’s skin was really too thick, and he could not cut into its brain.

Unless Ling Han crawled into the hole in its eye and attacked at a closer distance.

Forget it. Without its eyes, this giant elephant could only cause trouble and trample even more Demonic Beasts to death.

The giant elephant was in pain. It shook its body crazily and entered a berserk state.

Ling Han grabbed the tip of one elephant tusk with one hand while searching for the whereabouts of Huan Xue, Sun Jianfang, and the others.

Under the onslaught of such a beast tide, the Xuanqing Banner’s warriors had long been scattered. Ling Han quickly caught sight of Huan Xue, who was with Sun Jianfang.

The current situation of the two of them was very bad. After all, Sun Jianfang was only a First Change Blood Transformation Tier cultivator. It was already difficult enough for him to be besieged by more than ten Twelve Meridians Demonic Beasts, and there were more than just tenTwelve Meridians Demonic Beasts here.

Ling Han let out a long cry and climbed down from the giant elephant’s body. Then, he charged towards Huan Xue and Sun Jianfang.

Peng, peng, peng, he threw a punch, and under the powerful shockwave, the Demonic Beasts in front of him were instantly sent flying.

In just a few steps, Ling Han had arrived in front of Huan Xue.

“Young Master!” Huan Xue called out in pleasant surprise. When she had seen Ling Han charge up the giant elephant, she had been extremely nervous. That kind of size was enough to suffocate anyone.

Ling Han glanced over, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but twitch. Even under such circumstances, Huan Xue was still hugging that lecherous pig.

“Retreat!” He said in a deep voice. There was nothing he could do. The scale and intensity of the beast tide had far exceeded his expectations. The only thing he could do now was to rush out of Huju City.

The three of them began to break out of the encirclement, but they didn’t go too far. Ling Han could feel that the mystical power in his body was being used up too quickly. If he continued to expend it like this, it would take at most ten minutes, and he would definitely be exhausted.

“Enter one of the houses,” Ling Han said.

The three of them hid in a relatively intact residence. With such a cover, they immediately had room to breathe.

However, good things did not last long. With a bang, a wall was shattered, and a Demonic Beast that was about six meters long rushed in.

Although it wasn’t very big, it was shockingly also an existence in Blood Transformation Tier.

…The cultivation level of a Demonic Beast was not measured by its size. However, those that were huge were usually slightly more powerful, surpassing those that were in the same cultivation level.

“I’ll do it!” Sun Jianfang stepped forward bravely. He knew that Ling Han had expended too much energy, and needed to conserve his power.
