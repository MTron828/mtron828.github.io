3091 Summoned by the Sect Master

Ling Han got up. He realized that he was already wearing a coarse linen shirt, and he wondered who had changed his clothes for him.

He slowly stepped on the ground. With his feet on the ground, he wanted to stand up, but he almost fell to the ground.

F*ck, this feeling of powerlessness simply made one want to die.

Ling Han was depressed. In the past, he had been so awesome that he had swept through countless ferocious beings, easily destroying heavenly bodies and devouring the heavens, but now he actually didn’t even have the strength to stand up. This was too depressing.

“Young Master, you’re awake?” A woman’s voice sounded.

Ling Han turned his head to look. This was a maid in green clothes. She looked quite sweet, and could just barely be considered a beauty. He asked, “Who are you?”

“Young Master, I don’t understand what you’re saying,” the maid in green said.

However, she was quite smart. She quickly nodded, and said, “This servant is called Huan Xue. I’m here to serve Young Master.”

Ling Han nodded, and gestured at Huan Xue, meaning for her to teach him how to speak.

He could understand the other party’s words, so learning how to speak was actually very simple. In just half a day’s time, Ling Han had mostly mastered the language of this world.

Zhi!

The door was pushed open, and sunlight shone down. A tall man appeared at the door, but because the sunlight was too dazzling, his face couldn’t be seen. One could only tell that he was an extremely tall man.

“Greetings, Young Master Li!” Huan Xue hurriedly bowed.

Only then did the man walk in, and his appearance could be seen clearly.

This was a young man in his early twenties. He was very handsome, and every move he made gave off a feeling of power.

“My name is Li Changdan.” The young man smiled, appearing very cultured and refined. “After resting for two days, you can finally get up. This is really good news.”

He seemed to be very concerned about Ling Han, but Ling Han had experienced many great storms, and was able to see through the other’s deception with a single glance, seeing the contempt and hostility hidden in the depths of the other’s eyes.

‘What a hypocrite,’ Ling Han said this in his heart. He deliberately pretended not to understand, and spouted nonsense. In any case, the other party did not understand, either.

Li Changdan left after sitting for a while. He was all smiles, as if he didn’t mind at all.

“Who is this guy?” Ling Han asked Huan Xue.

Huan Xue immediately revealed a look of admiration. “Young Master Li is the most outstanding disciple of our Ancient Dao Sect. You don’t know, but Young Master Li is only 21 years old now, but he has already opened nine meridians. His strength is shocking.”

Opening his meridians?

Ling Han had the urge to laugh out loud. This sounded like only the initial stage of cultivation, yet it could actually be called shocking strength?

However, he immediately sighed. He could barely even stand. In comparison, he could only be considered a baby.

That made sense. He had just been born from the Divine Stone. If he wasn’t a baby, then what was he? However, judging from his size, he was already a super giant baby.

“What kind of place is this?” Ling Han was curious. What kind of world had he entered?

Huan Xue was only a maid, so she didn’t know much. She told Ling Han everything she knew in detail.

This was the Ancient Dao Sect, a place to cultivate martial arts. The sect master’s name was Sun Jianfang, and it was said that he was already more than 100 years old. He was the first batch of people to stand out after the upheavals of heaven and earth. Now, he had also become a regional elite, looking down on the world.

In this era, everyone yearned to cultivate and obtain strength, but the path of cultivation was too difficult. For example, Huan Xue didn’t have any natural talent in cultivation, so she could only be a maid and rely on the protection of the Ancient Dao Sect.

Why?

After the drastic changes in heaven and earth, the wild beasts that could only be prey in the past suddenly began to evolve violently, occupying a large number of territories that had belonged to humans, causing humans that had once been the most intelligent life form to become prey.

A small number of people were lucky enough to enter the territory overseen by elites. Those who were even luckier were able to be taken in as disciples by elites and walk on the path of cultivation. Those who were not so lucky, such as Huan Xue, could only be reduced to a servant.

However, this was all that Huan Xue knew. She had been in the Ancient Dao Sect since she had been born, and had never left the mountain in all her 19 years of life. Therefore, her knowledge was limited.

Ling Han had to ask someone else.

Fortunately, only a day later, Ling Han was summoned by the sect master of the Ancient Dao Sect.

“Young Master, when you meet Lord Sect Master, you must maintain a humble attitude,” Huan Xue advised Ling Han. “Lord Sect Master can decide the life and death of everyone. If you accidentally anger Lord Sect Master, there is no need to kill you. You only have to be thrown down the mountain, and you will be eaten by wild beasts.”

Ling Han smiled. Although this maidservant was inexperienced and not very knowledgeable, she had a good heart.

“I got it.”

Over the past few days, his strength had been increasing at every moment. At the very least, walking was no longer a problem.

He soon arrived at Sect Master Sun Jianfang’s courtyard. After knocking on the door, he was led in by a servant boy.

The courtyard was very large, and a white-haired old man was drinking tea in the garden. Hearing the sound of him entering, he turned around and looked towards Ling Han.

It was an old man in his seventies. He put down his teacup and smiled. “Come here.”

Sun Jianfang?

According to Huan Xue, this old man was already more than 100 years old. It seemed that he had taken good care of himself.

Ling Han walked over as he was told. His current strength was close to zero, and although the person in front of him was very old, it was like there was a ferocious tiger hidden in his body. To speak of fighting one of him, even if there were 10 of him, it would not be a problem.

Therefore, it was better to go along with this old geezer for the time being.

Ling Han walked over, and said, “I have many questions.”

Sun Jianfang raised his white brows. “That’s right. It’s only been four days, but you’ve already learned our language. As expected of a Divine Son born of the heavens.

Ling Han said, “I don’t understand.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“More than 30 years ago, I entered an ancient site to search for opportunities, but it was too dangerous. I spent a lot of effort and almost died, but I only obtained a stone and a notebook.

“This is the notebook of a great elite from ancient times. He was once incomparably powerful. He said that this stone was also obtained by him during an adventure. Its origins might be incomparably great.

“Therefore, he called it the Divine Stone. He believed that it contained some kind of power of the heaven and earth. One day, it would nurture a living being that would reach an unprecedented height of power.

“Three years ago, there was a commotion from the Divine Stone. I thought that the Divine Son was about to be born. I didn’t expect that the time was still not ripe. After a while, the Divine Stone stopped.

“It’s alright. However, after waiting for another three years, you still came out.”

Sun Jianfang stopped and took a sip of tea.

Ling Han was shocked. The Divine Stones had gone berserk three years ago?

According to Extermination, 3,000 epochs ago, the first generation Genesis World had been destroyed.

In theory, it would only be the collapse of the Genesis World that could cause the Divine Stone to riot. Otherwise, with the Void so big and the energy storms, how could it alarm the Divine Stone?

But, three years ago?
