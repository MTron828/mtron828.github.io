Chapter 2016: Belief

Those on the ancient castle’s side all paled in great shock.

They were filled with absolute confidence in the cultivation technique they cultivated and the deity that they worshiped, and reality had also proven that their system of cultivation was really superior and noble uncountable times.

...Did you think that Ling Han and his group were the first people to come to this island? You would be wrong. Who knew how many batches of people had come here. But after they had arrived here, there had never been any who left.

But now?

An outsider whose cultivation level was inferior to Xiao Jun could actually beat down on Xiao Jun.

It should be known that Xiao Jun was the best in terms of natural talent among them.

If even Xiao Jun would be defeated, then there would be no one capable of being a match for Ling Han in the same cultivation level.

This had overturned the superiority complex that they had maintained for all this while, and also caused a sliver of crack to appear in their confidence, shaking the belief that they had in their deity.

Xiao Jun roared furiously, trying his best to turn his disadvantageous position around, but all that was merely wasted effort.

Ling Han was simply stronger than he was. Though he was not very much stronger, when one had reached the level they had, how could they afford the slightest gap?

When the battle had progressed to close to 1,000 exchanges, Ling Han shot out a kick. Peng, Xiao Jun was sent flying, and crashed solidly into the wall.

“Brother Ling is indeed strong!” Xiao Jun rubbed the discomfort in his chest, and forced out a smile.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and replied, “Good battle!”

He did not listen to Small Tower’s words and directly killed the man, because this was the latter’s territory. There were a good number of Immortal Palace Tier-level elites alone, and that Island Master that had been in seclusion all this while was even likely to be an Ascending Origin Tier.

If he killed anyone, that would mean turning completely hostile, without any way out.

Hearing Xiao Jun admit defeat personally, those on the ancient castle’s side all broke into a commotion. The deity that they had believed in all this while practically crumbled in an instant, and they could not accept it.

Xiao Jun was unconcerned, however. Instead, the smile on his face became even more pronounced as he said, “Brother Ling’s natural talent in cultivation is really astonishing, and if Brother Ling is willing to switch to cultivating the vein of cultivation technique of my master, I can guarantee that Brother Ling’s strength will improve to another level!”

When everyone heard this, they all nodded.

Just now, that other person had just believed in some deity, and his battle prowess had improved four to five times all of a sudden. If the same logic was applied on Ling Han, just how strong would he be by then?

And also precisely because of this, the people on the ancient castle’s side also recovered their confidence quickly.

That was right. What conflict did Ling Han being strong have with their deity being strong? As long as Ling Han was willing to switch to believing in their god, Ling Han would be able to become even stronger. Then, didn’t that mean that there was not the slightest bit of mistake in their choice?

Seeing the increasingly heated gazes all around him, Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. Looks like all his actions previously had been wasted effort.

Firstly, these people were too captivated, and secondly, Xiao Jun’s adaptability was extremely impressive. Otherwise, he only had to fly into a humiliated anger, and it would deepen the doubts in everyone’s hearts. The situation would definitely not have been like it was now.

Interesting. He was a good opponent.

A smile appeared at the corners of Ling Han’s lips. Though Small Tower’s words were very frightening, to actually be able to shake the foundations of the heaven and earth, who knew how many people were needed to cultivate this cultivation technique to be able to accomplish that. As for merely those 30-odd people gathered here?

No more than a drop in the ocean.

Then he’d just play, and cause a great disturbance. The best scenario would be waiting until Lu Hairong came here, and sweeping this entire place over with a single push.

To those who stayed in this heaven and earth, the people of the ancient castle were akin to vermin that would affect the existence of the heaven and earth. Though it was now a majestic tower, and was definitely not something that a few bugs could damage, if these bugs were not quickly stomped on, who knew how far they would develop?

Just like the 30-plus people today being bewitched by Xiao Jun and his group, how many of them would throw themselves into these welcoming arms?

This kind of poisonous vermin should be eliminated immediately.

“Young Master Xiao, please teach us the celestial technique!” someone called out shamelessly.

“Please teach the celestial technique!” even more people called out.

A slightly proud expression appeared on Xiao Jun’s face. A situation that could have possibly been complete chaos had returned to the original course with just a few words from him, and even he could not help but want to cheer for himself.

“There is no need to rush. My master has a great wish to teach the technique to the world, and definitely would not keep the treasure to himself,” he said with a slight smile, seeming extremely sincere.

This touched the outsiders incredibly, and they felt that the Island Master was really the kindest and most benevolent person in this world, being willing to teach a supreme cultivation technique without any reservations. There was definitely no other person that could be as generous as that.

Ling Han smirked internally. At first, he had been curious why Xiao Jun was so determined to teach the cultivation technique of his master, but through Small Tower’s explanation, Ling Han now knew that this was an invasion.

Once it succeeded, to the entire Celestial Realm, no, to the Celestial Realm, Ancient Realm and all other small worlds, it would be an absolute calamity.

And going by that logic, the explanation of their Island Master being presently in seclusion, and thus unable to decide whether to allow them to cut trees, was actually a falsehood. Their motive was merely to prevent them from leaving the island.

“Those that are willing to cultivate this cultivation technique, please come with me!” Xiao Jun announced loudly. Immediately, practically everyone followed behind him.

Aside from Ling Han.

Ling Han was stunned. Even Qin Wei had fallen for it?

Very soon, the people here had all left. Aside from Ling Han, only Lan Ruozhi, this delicate and bewitching woman, was still seated in a graceful position. Her arms were stretched out and placed on the chair’s backrest, causing her breasts to become even more pronounced.

A smile appeared at her lips, while her alluring eyes were filled with challenge.

Ling Han was unlike the others, who were easily hooked. This spiked her interest. She wanted to personally pull Ling Han over to their side, and once she succeeded, she would have her 17th consort.

That was right. She enjoyed playing with men, and any man that she had her eye on, no matter how much of a prodigy he was, would not be able to resist her charms.

“Young Master Ling is really so awesome. Having been here on this island for so many years, this is the first time I have seen Eldest Senior Brother defeated in a battle of equal cultivation level,” she said delicately, her voice like ****** and incredibly melodious.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and stated, “There are about one or two dozen people like me in the Eastern Celestial Realm, at least, and there would be even more in the Western Celestial Realm.”

Who cared whether there really was or not. He would just brag first, and find out later.

Meanwhile, Lan Ruozhi smiled alluringly. “Young Master Ling, just now Eldest Senior Brother asked you if you were willing to join us. A supreme technique will be taught to you, so even while your cultivation level does not change, your battle prowess would increase tenfold at least!”

“Wasn’t it said that your father has the wish to spread his technique without any reservations? Why is there a need to join you?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“Spreading the technique is one matter, but the truly amazing part will only be taught to the innermost core portion of people. Isn’t that right, Young Master Ling?” Lan Ruozhi suddenly straightened her upper body. When she said ‘isn’t that right’, she tapped her finger lightly on her breast.

Underneath the tight fitting fabric, the outline of her extremely seductive plump breasts was fully displayed.

Ling Han ignored it completely. In terms of looks, there was no way she could catch up to the Empress and Hu Niu. In terms of bearing, the Empress left her behind in her dust. In terms of allure, Bewitching Maiden Rou was completely out of her reach.

Even Bewitching Maiden Rou was unable to move him, what more this kind of woman?

Thoughts streaked through Ling Han’s mind like lightning. If he was to destroy the force on this island all alone, this was completely unrealistic.

Then, there were only two paths laid out in front of him.

First, wait for Lu Hairong to arrive, and then destroy this place. Second, he could feign civility with them first, and then take the chance to build a ship and leave. Then, he could come back later to destroy this place.

Whichever the case, he could not immediately turn hostile with them at present.

Thus, Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “On the contrary, I am slightly interested now.”
