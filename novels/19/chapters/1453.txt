Chapter 1454 Enraged Gu Daoyi

When Gu Daoyi’s main body dropped, naturally, so did the bodies of his nine lives. Just when it seemed like their attacks were about to reach Ling Han, they all dropped.

The threat was naturally resolved on its own.

‘This...!’

When they saw this scene, everyone felt much sympathy for Gu Daoyi. If it was them, they, too, would want to throw curses.

Who said Ling Han only knew one move and kept using the same move over and over again? He used another move, and see, Gu Daoyi was defeated in an instant.

If Ling Han had used this move right from the start, everyone would definitely feel very disdainful, and think that he had used a cheap trick. However, Ling Han had battled fiercely with Gu Daoyi first, and displayed his strong abilities to the public. Thus, though this was an extremely cheap trick, everyone would only be impressed by his quick wits.

Someone who was stubborn, and only knew to battle to death; could that really be considered a king tier as well?

That was more like a brash fool.

“Hahaha, I never thought that it would end like this.”

“Why do I feel a little bit of deja vu?”

“That Large Black Dog!”

“He, Ling Han’s style is really a little like the Large Black Dog’s. Those that trifle with him would definitely feel incredibly depressed at the end.”

When they thought of that, loud laughter was heard from beneath. Upon closer thought, this was indeed quite amusing. Gu Daoyi accumulated his power step by step, and just when it looked like he was going to release his strongest ultimate move, he was screwed in an instant.

They were uncontrollably amused by the great contrast.

Peng!

Gu Daoyi fell right down to the valley floor, causing the dust on the ground to fly. Under the special Regulations in this Sunken Abyss Valley, even Heavenly Body Tiers were incapable of flight.

He immediately got back to his feet, and released a roar filled with killing intent and fury.

This fall was definitely the greatest humiliation in his life. Though it was only a fall of 3,000 meters, and had only taken the time of over a dozen breaths, as he fell, he could clearly see the mocking expression on the face of everyone on each level.

This caused him to flush bright red, and he almost exploded.

He had never experienced such great humiliation. It was practically comparable to how he had been cast out of the Celestial Realm.

“I, will, kill, you!” he uttered word by word, his black locks soaring skywards. He had gone mad with rage.

He grabbed another floating rock, and charged all the way up at an astonishing speed. All the elites presently would definitely be on the upper levels, so who could stop him in the lower levels? Even if they joined forces, it was useless. In the face of this supreme king tier, what could a mere dozen people do?

Ling Han, on the other hand, was ascending at a much slower rate. That was because those fighting him were all the top elites of the current generation. If he wanted to win, it was difficult! And even if he could win, he would need to spend an extremely long time for it.

Because there were too few people above, every step upwards was also extremely difficult. Those supreme king tiers were unwilling to begin a battle easily, either, and thus everyone was waiting. They were waiting for those below to ascend. Then, they would naturally have stepping stones to go upwards even further.

The battle among them would be left for the last, commencing the moment when they reached the golden floating rock. Otherwise, there was completely no need for them to begin a battle at this time. As long as everyone maintained their position at the same height, they naturally would be able to obtain the same fortune blessing by the heaven and earth; what need was there for a battle to the death?

“Ling! Han!” Gu Daoyi’s speed was extremely fast, charging all the way from the bottom. Now, the steps were formed. Every time he moved, he could rise six to nine meters; how long would a distance of 3,000 meters take?

He was especially angered, and summoned a Divine Sword. He had forged this sword in his first lifetime after he had fallen into the Immortal Realm. It was an authentic Divine Sword, and was a Level 20 one at that, the strongest in the Immortal Realm!

Pa. The sword struck, yet a brick quietly appeared and blocked the sword’s blade. Empress Luan Xing moved, her hand holding a brick, and her fighting spirit burning.

This strike actually came to an abrupt half.

“What!?” When they saw this move, all the people below them exploded into a commotion.

That was a strike filled with the ire of Gu Daoyi, yet had actually been stopped forcibly, proving that the abilities of person who had moved were not beneath Gu Daoyi.

Who was this again!? So powerful!

They looked towards Empress Luan Xing. Though there was a layer of cloth in the way of their sight, everyone could discover that tempting bearing. This was a beauty that could enchant others without even needing to reveal her true appearance.

“You dare stop me?” Gu Daoyi asked harshly. His whole body was exuding killing intent and aggression. In this moment, he would kill whoever dared stop him.

“Can’t I?” Empress Luan Xing smirked. “How insolent, who do you think you are!”

Gu Daoyi gave a start. He had really never thought that this woman was even more arrogant and overbearing than he was. She was but a mere woman, so how could she possibly be so bold?

He felt that he was really starting to like this woman.

However, she had also cultivated the Nine Deaths Heaven Art, so it was destined that he would swallow her physical body. He could not possibly make her his own, so in his eyes, no matter how beautiful she was, or how enchanting her charms were, she was only a tool to improve his own abilities.

How could he possibly like a tool?

“Die!” He shot out a finger. This was the God of Blood Finger.

Empress Luan Xing waved a hand, and greeted the incoming attack with her brick.

The finger tapped, yet nothing happened at all.

The might of this finger had been completely absorbed by the brick.

The Absolute Beginning Stone, evolved from the Chaos Source Rock, the stone of origin created at the beginning of heaven and earth, could absorb all attack beneath the Genesis Tier. Though its might was also limited now, it still had an unpredictable might.

At least, the might of the God of Blood Finger was still inadequate. Perhaps he would have to use the Mystical Power of Ten Lives, and combine all the secret techniques of his nine lives to be capable of breaking through the limits of the Absolute Beginning Stone.

The problem now was, he was unable to directly use the Mystical Power of Ten Lives. He had to use the secret techniques from the nine lifetimes first, and only then would he be able to use the supreme secret technique of his 10th lifetime.

“You are not qualified to stand in the way of my husband’s path of ascension to the heavens!” Empress Luan Xing uttered proudly. She looked down arrogantly as she pointed at Gu Daoyi like she was an empress rebuking a subject that dared disrespect her.

For Ling Han’s sake, she would stand in the way of any elite that could pose a threat.

The tenderness of the empress would only bloom for one man.

Gu Daoyi’s expression was livid. He did not think that Empress Luan Xing could stop him, but the fact that a woman whose abilities were practically enough to match his own would go so far for a man actually made him feel jealous.

“If you stop me, you will be seeking your own death!” he threatened menacingly.

“In your dreams!” Empress Luan Xing uttered coldly. At present, everyone’s cultivation level was equal, and when the restriction was released, both of their cultivation levels were equal as well. Thus, she would definitely be battling Gu Daoyi.

The both of them had cultivated the Nine Deaths Heaven Art, and it was destined that one would be paving the way for the other. Thus, she definitely had to win. This was a duel to the death that could not be avoided.

Gu Daoyi did not respond further, the flames of his fury burning ever bright. Only one person between himself and Empress Luan Xing could survive, but this was obviously not a good place to engage in a duel to the death. As long as the floating rock shattered, they would naturally leave the battle.

Furthermore, his target was the gold floating rock at the apex. That place should contain a great fated opportunity for him!

‘Damn!’ VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

His fighting spirit bubbled. He decided to defeat Empress Luan Xing as soon as possible, and then catch up to Luan Xing so he would be the first to reach the golden floating rock.

“Mystical Power of the first life!”

“Mystical Power of the second life!”

“...”

“Mystical Power of Ten Lives!”

Gu Daoyi put his full effort into the battle, and after accumulating energy for a while, all 10 lifetimes appeared once more.
