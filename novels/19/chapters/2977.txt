2978 Fifth Tier!

Ling Han sought the Empress and Hu Niu to tell them that he would be going into seclusion. As he would not leave until he was at the Fifth Tier, he naturally had to inform them of his absence.

After that, he began his cultivation.

He took out the dimensional core fragment, and placed his hand on top of it. Immediately, he felt a strange wave of power radiating from it. Peng, peng, peng. The core trembled greatly, warping the sight before Ling Han’s eyes. His surroundings quickly darkened until there was nothing but countless stars.

Fundamental particles.

However, Ling Han was already in possession of three fundamental particles. As these fundamental particles completely rejected all the others, their bodies were crystal clear, while the other three were blurry, and could neither be seen nor touched.

It was difficult to go from the Fourth Tier to the Fifth Tier in the first place. This rang true even for the greatest prodigy of all eternity like Ling Han.

He calmed himself down and started using the dimensional core to resonate with the other three fundamental particles to make them clearer.

The speed of progression was extremely low, but there was no helping it. Ling Han was only able to obtain a fragment of the dimensional core. Even though it was a rather big piece, it was still far from a complete core.

However, Ling Han was confident in his abilities. All he needed was a catalyst.

He let go of his pride and ego.

Thanks to the relatively mundane life he had over the past several hundred million years, Ling Han was able to quiet his mind.

Time slowly passed. 10 years, 100 years, 1,000 years. Ling Han let go of all worldly attachments as he bonded with the dimensional core and resonated with heaven and earth.

In a flash, 900,000,000 years had flown by. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The dimensional core in Ling Han’s hand no longer emitted any light. It was just a fragment to begin with, and with its energy depleted, it had become nothing more than an ordinary rock. However, Ling Han was still immersed in his contemplation on a deeper level. The dimensional core had already served its intended purpose. Now, it was up to Ling Han to do what he could.

Each advancement for a Heavenly Venerate could be difficult, or it could be easy. Some would not be able to advance a single step even after spending epochs trying, whereas others could make that monumental leap after just sensing one of these fundamental particles.

In Ling Han’s mind, the three originally blurry fundamental particles had become much clearer. However, they were still dormant.

Ling Han wanted to take control of all three fundamental particles in a single breath, but that was not realistic. If he truly had such intentions, he would only end up with nothing.

As such, he chose one of the particles, and began resonating with it much more deeply.

Time passed once more as the particle became even clearer in his mind. In fact, it was almost in reach.

‘It’s time!’

Ling Han opened his eyes. Weng! Energy surged around him, as though it had taken a physical form.

Guided with both hands, a mysterious power instantly fused into his body.

Boom! Ling Han’s body changed drastically.

Even though it was just a tiny vestige, it was enough to bring about a qualitative change. This was because it was the fundamental power of the fourth particle.

Receive Particle!

Ling Han didn’t end his cultivation there, as being able to sense the fourth fundamental particle was only the first step. His strength still had not undergone a qualitative change.

He calmed himself and extracted more energy from the Receive Particle to train his physique.

With the cultivation level broken through, Ling Han’s energy capacity surged as well, and he was now able to contain even more energy. He was now able to store over 10,000 realms.

At this stage, he could refine every dimension he had inside his body into a high-level dimension, but he would need time… a near-boundless length of time.

Perhaps these dimensions could only reach their peak after several hundred epochs.

And this was only for a high-level dimension. What about the transcendent dimensions?

Perhaps they would never be able to reach such heights.

After another seven hundred million years, Ling Han finally stopped.

He stood up with absolute confidence.

Now that he had a Seventh Tier’s battle prowess, he was virtually unbeatable.

It was time to save his son and daughter.

As soon as Ling Han came out of his cultivation, the Empress and Hu Niu rushed over in joy.

“Ling Han, you’ve succeeded?” Hu Niu asked.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I’m going to go rescue Jianxue and Xi’er. Wait for me here.”

The two women nodded. Even Hu Niu was not being willful now.

They knew that even though Ling Han now possessed a Seventh Tier’s battle prowess, he still didn’t have the immortal physique of the Seventh Tier. Against Chong Yan and Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, he was still at a disadvantage. As such, they didn’t want to add to Ling Han’s problems.

Ling Han immediately set off to Western Clouds Heaven.

The distance was very far, but to a Seventh Tier, as long as it was within the same realm, it was simply the matter of a few steps no matter how far. In less than an hour, Ling Han arrived in the vicinity.

After that, there was the Hundred Frost Valley. The ground here was covered in a dense layer of snow, and what was strange about this place was that there was white snow and black snow. There was even red snow. Looking from the sky, the place was like a piece of brocade, and was extremely colorful.

The Hundred Frost Valley was still quite a big area. Ling Han emitted his divine sense, but he was extremely careful, and had to slowly spread his divine sense out. There was surely a Seventh Tier guarding this place, and it was best to avoid startling the enemy if he could help it as this was a rescue operation.

After rescuing everyone, he would head to the Genesis World of the last era and dig up more Great Herbs so that he could reach the Sixth Tier as soon as possible. Once he did, he would be able to suppress even Seventh Tiers.

Found them!

Ling Han quickly locked in on several auras which had a resonance with his bloodline.

He moved silently, and he came upon a gloomy valley where dozens of people were sitting cross-legged in the span of a few breaths.

Ling Jianxue, Ling Xi, Fu Tianxing, Rain Emperor, Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the large black dog. They were all his descendants, disciple, comrades, and friends.

Even though they were trapped, they clearly didn’t give up, and persisted in their cultivation. Even those like Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing had advanced further despite their late start and reached the Fourth Tier, while Ling Jianxue was at the Third Tier, and Ling Feifan at the Second Tier. It was truly astonishing to have so many Heavenly Venerates under the same clan.

The Rain Emperor and Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable were both at the Third Tier, while the large black dog was still at the Second Tier. This seemed to be his limit.

“Hmm?” Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing suddenly opened their eyes. This was because Ling Han had accidentally leaked out some of his aura from his excitement.

“What is it?” Ling Jianxue asked. His cultivation level was lower, so he didn’t sense anything.

“Someone is spying on us,” Ling Xi said, using her divine sense.

Ling Jianxue raised his eyebrow and humphed. They were already prisoners. Who would spy on them?

“Stop hiding and show yourself!” Ling Feifan barked.

Ling Han sighed. He had intended to come and go quietly, but now that Ling Feifan yelled so loudly, the old monster guarding this place surely had to have been alarmed.

He walked out and smiled. “Would it kill you to be a little quiet?!”

Ling Feifan was shocked, but his expression soon turned to joy. “Old man, it’s you!”

“Why? Am I not welcome?” Ling Han glared, and added, “Then I guess I should just leave.”

“Father!” Ling Jianxue and Ling Xi shouted at the same time. They were both elated.

“Fourth Brother!”

“Little Han!”

They all knew that now that Ling Han was here, he clearly intended to rescue them, and he undoubtedly had a pretty high chance of doing so.

“Greetings, Master,” Fu Tianxing said as he hastily knelt.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “We can reminisce later. Let’s leave this place now.”

“Hmph, since you’re already here, why leave?” a cold voice remarked. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains appeared.
