2906 Beaten until bursting

Meng Dong and the others fused together, and transformed into a miniature Hysteria. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Its entire body was covered in tentacles that lashed out like whips one after another with astonishing momentum.

It had been enhanced with a first-grade seal, and the five of them had fused together, so its power had naturally skyrocketed. At the cost of sacrificing the endless lifespans of Heavenly Venerates, its strength experienced an inconceivable increase.

Swish, swish, swish. Tentacles lashed out, bringing endless darkness and evil. To this space, it was like a calamity.

Ling Han was also enhanced with a first-grade seal, and then he fought head-on with the fusion monster.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

In the intense battle, both sides ended up in a draw.

Ling Han was secretly astonished. One had to know that even if five Fourth Tiers joined forces, even if all of them were at the peak stage of the Fourth Tier, it was still impossible for them to push their power to the Fifth Tier. However, not only did these five people achieve this, they had also reached the middle stage of the Fifth Tier, and were not inferior to him at all.

As expected of a creation of Hysteria, having all kinds of special abilities.

“Ling Han, you only have one first-grade seal, and that can only last for two hours. At that time, let’s see what other methods you have to fight me!” the fusion body roared.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Don’t celebrate too early.”

He wanted to see just what kind of ability a creation of Hysteria would possess, so he didn’t unleash his battle prowess to the extreme. Instead, he focused on countering the other party’s move one after another.

However, after going back and forth for two hours, the fusion body still didn’t have any new moves, much to his disappointment.

“It’s time for you to die!” Meng Dong’s fusion body shouted as he channeled another Heavenly Venerable Seal. This was also a first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal, and enhanced its power by more than 80 times, allowing its battle prowess to remain unchanged.

As for Ling Han?

He only had one first-grade seal, and it would be gone once the energy release was over.

“Die!” The fusion body opened its huge mouth, and countless weapons instantly gushed out, turning into raindrops that slashed towards Ling Han.

Now, this secret technique was executed with the battle prowess of the Fifth Tier, and with the first-grade seal amplifying its power by more than 80 times, its might was incomparably terrifying.

Ling Han shook his head, and all the eighth-grade seals lit up at the same time, illuminating the heavens within his body1. Hong, his power soared by 1,000 times.

Peng!

He only threw a simple punch, but the weapons that were attacking him were completely shattered at the same time. The power of his fist did not diminish at all, and it continued to surge forward at an extremely fast speed.

The fusion body didn’t even have time to react before a large hole was blasted open in its chest, and black blood gushed out uncontrollably.

It wanted to speak, but it couldn’t utter a single word. Pa, pa, pa. The tentacles on its body fell off one after another, followed by flesh and blood, which soon scattered into bloody mud all over the ground.

…Under Ling Han’s punch, its whole body was already shattered.

That was a power enhancement of 1,000 times. At the Fifth Tier, Ling Han would definitely be capable of killing anyone in his way.

Weng!

However, the fusion body’s spirit did not immediately dissipate, turning into a final wave of attack that surged towards Ling Han.

This attack was too fast. Ling Han had only just reacted when this attack wave had already rushed into his mind, intending to cause great destruction and destroy his will.

However, without any initiative on his part, the millions and millions of Powers of Dimension in his body automatically channeled at the same time, turning into millstones that could crush anything.

The impact from this divine sense attack was very strong. It was originally strong enough to pierce through a Fifth Tier’s mind, but after being crushed by the millstone, the shock wave split into millions and millions of small fragments, and then completely shattered. There was no longer the slightest threat.

Meng Dong and the others let out unwilling wails, but they couldn’t reverse the inevitable outcome, and dissipated one after another.

Ling Han made his move, wanting to capture their remnant souls. However, he discovered that a black shadow had risen from their blood, and had transformed into Hysteria again. However, it was smaller, only the size of a fist, yet the aura it emitted was incomparably terrifying. Even Ling Han couldn’t help but stop in his tracks and cease his movements.

This still couldn’t be the main body of Hysteria, but it was very likely a projected doppelganger that had temporarily descended with the blood essence of Meng Dong and the others.

However, Hysteria did not make a move. It only stared at Ling Han, and waved its countless tentacles. Hong, it suddenly dissipated and vanished into thin air.

Only then did Ling Han heave a sigh of relief. It would be strange if he wasn’t nervous in the face of this most ferocious creature in all of history.

“Oh no, I’ve been tricked!” He suddenly reacted and reached out to grab at the air. However, he missed because the remnant souls of Meng Dong and the others had completely disappeared.

Only then did he realize why Hysteria’s doppelganger hadn’t made a move—it was impossible for the other party to make a move. It was just an empty shell that had frightened him.

And why did it do that?

It was naturally to prevent him from seizing the souls of Meng Dong and the others and reading their secrets, including the Heavenly Venerable Seals and the identities of the other survivors. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

F***.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. He had always been the one to scare others, but he had unexpectedly been tricked by Hysteria this time.

He felt that it was a pity. He could have gotten five more first-grade seals.

Five, a whopping five of them!

‘Moreover, these five people actually didn’t contribute any life essence. Is this because of the appearance of Hysteria’s consciousness, or was it due to the fusion of these five people?

‘Forget it, at least I obtained two. Moreover, I should be able to read the information of the other survivors from these two people.’

Ling Han began to refine the remnant souls of Shao Ying and Ba Duo, extracting what he needed from them.

As for the Heavenly Venerable Seals, it went very smoothly. He quickly obtained two first-grade seals, as well as a number of ninth- and eighth-grade seals. He left out the duplicates and sealed them in Heavenly Venerable Stone scraps. However, the list of remaining survivors left Ling Han somewhat speechless.

This was because the list obtained from the two of them was completely different. Moreover, there were as many as 200 people on each list, including people like Zhou Heng and Chu Hao. All of them had become traitors.

Of course, this was impossible.

In other words, these people had already made preparations for this. Even if they died, it would be impossible for others to obtain any useful information through a soul search of their remnant souls. If they were to hunt according to these two lists, there might really be a few Hysteria moles among them, but the majority of them were innocent people.

At that time, the entire world would be in chaos, and the number of Heavenly Venerates would also wither to an unbelievable extent.

Ling Han shook his head. He also gave up on taking Shao Ying and Ba Duo’s first-grade seals for himself. He was already powerful enough, and the Empress and Hu Niu lacked high-level Heavenly Venerable Seals. Thus, he planned to let the two women master these two seals.

The two women came out of the Celestial Guest Residence. After hearing what Ling Han said, they didn’t stand on ceremony, and each took one Heavenly Venerable Seal. Then, they proceeded to enter into seclusion in the Celestial Guest Residence to refine them.

Ling Han set off again to find Zhou Heng and the others.
