Chapter 3609: Cold Water Lake

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han naturally could not possibly go to that place with Li Xingchen. He had not even entered into Mystery Realm Tier yet, so what was the point of joining in on the excitement?

Moreover, the Heavenly Dao Foundation elites weren’t worthy of his attention. If he wanted to make a trip on the way, he wouldn’t mind, but it definitely wouldn’t be at the price of delaying his time to obtain the Five Elements Karmic Pill.

After eating, Ling Han bid farewell to Li Xingchen. The latter now had a One Star Spirit Tool, so he was much more confident.

Ling Han took a look. He was less than 50km away from the Cold Water Lake.

Bringing the children with him, it wasn’t long before they arrived at their destination.

Rather than calling the Cold Water Lake a lake, it would be better to call it a sea.

This lake was extraordinarily huge, and the edge could not be seen at all. It was said that the widest place was about 2500km, and the narrowest place was also more than 1000km.

The entire lake area was suppressed by heaven and earth. Even if elites of Celestial Path came, they would also be suppressed to Mystery Realm Tier.

Sometimes, when Celestial Path elites weren’t paying attention, they would fly over the lake on their divine tools. If they weren’t high enough, they would also be affected by the heaven and earth, falling down from the sky for no reason.

This was the same as the Extreme Flame Valley. With the condensation of the power of heaven and earth, the Water Element would form unique creatures that would wander in the lake. Destroying it would allow one to obtain the essence of water, and if one gathered enough essence of water, they would be able to gather it to form the Water Element Crystal.

“I hate this place,” Fourth Baby immediately said.

She naturally had grasped the Mystical Power of Fire, and also especially disliked cold and humid environments, what more when this was an ocean.

“Hehe, I like this place.” Fifth Baby revealed a satisfied expression.

“All right, let’s move separately. This time… we’ll meet back here a month later,” Ling Han said.

“Yes, Father.” The seven children all nodded.

“Ling Han, you’re enslaving child workers like this, aren’t you afraid of a sore conscience?” the little loll said in rebuke as she licked the toffee.

Ling Han picked her up and said, “If you don’t speak, no one will think you’re mute.”

“Sigh, I told the truth, and was targeted.” The little loll shrugged and spread her hands, looking very helpless.

Ling Han and the others split up, and it was still Ling Han and the little loli who were in the same group. He had to keep an eye on this problematic child; she was too good at causing trouble.

The two of them entered into the lake, but it was obvious that this place was more troublesome than the Extreme Flame Valley. That was because there was a three-dimensional space in the water, which was far larger than the Extreme Flame Valley. The distribution of the Water Element was also more dispersed, so it was very difficult to find it.

Moreover, they hadn’t reached the Foundation Building Tier yet, so they couldn’t open their mouths to absorb the power of heaven and earth. Thus, they had to rely on air.

Which also meant that they could only hold their breaths and enter into the lake. When this breath was used up, he would have to breathe again. Otherwise, he would be suffocated to death.

Thankfully, with his present strength, it was not a problem for him to hold his breath for an hour or so.

“Girl, are you going into the gourd or are you going to hold your breath and come with me?” Ling Han asked.

“Of course, we’ll go into the sea together. If I stay in the gourd, I’ll die of boredom,” the little loli said without hesitation.

“All right then.”

The two of them took a deep breath, then entered into the lake. Suddenly, a strange chill assaulted them, causing their blood to instantly freeze.

So cold!

The little loli hurriedly crossed her arms over her chest, shivering incessantly.

Ling Han communicated with the flame energy and burned it on the surface of his body, instantly expelling the coldness, but in this way, there would be an additional expenditure on his Spiritual Power.

The little girl also activated the power of flames, expelling the coldness.

“What a godforsaken place.” She bared her teeth, “I hate this place.”

“Gourd?” Ling Han pointed at the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

“No.” The little girl still shook her head.

The two of them dived into the lake. There was not a single Water Element creature that could be seen on the surface of the water, so they had to dive in.

This lake was too big, so it was naturally abnormally deep. Ling Han activated his eye technique and could see about three hundred meters underwater. If it was any deeper, it would be too dark, and he wouldn’t be able to see anything at all.

The lake water was extraordinarily cold, and there were also a great many icebergs in the lake. It was said that some icebergs were as big as small islands, and there would also be Water Element creatures on them.

After the two of them swam for a while, a fish appeared ahead of them. It was about three meters long, but its body was very flat, and the widest part was only about a foot, looking like a very long sash.

It was brightly colored, and when it discovered Ling Han and the little loli, it immediately launched an attack. It opened its mouth, and xiu, an ice arrow shot out, rapidly shooting towards Ling Han.

“You think you’re the only one who knows how to shoot?” Ling Han mumbled inwardly. He resolutely opened his mouth and shot out a golden sword.

This was formed after he advanced into Seven Inscriptions, and was formed from the power of Metal, possessing extremely terrifying destructive power. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Shua, the sword slashed out, greeting the ice arrow. Instantly, the ice arrow was shattered, and its momentum did not decrease in the slightest, as it once again charged towards the multicoloured fish.

With a single strike, this long fish was killed by him, its body rapidly melting. It was originally formed from ice crystals, and now, it had turned back into water.

However, there was still a small drop of water that had not melted.

It was very strange. That was clearly a drop of water, but it had not fused with the lake waters.

Essence of Water.

Ling Han reached over and grabbed the drop of water.

It was very small, a hundred times smaller than a grain of rice. If it was not for the fact that Ling Han had extremely good eyesight, he would probably have missed it.

“The first,” Ling Han said with a smile. Of course, he only released a few bubbles of water.

He continued to swim in the lake waters, searching for new water element creatures.

This lake was really too big, and it seriously affected Ling Han’s speed in the water. Thus, after about ten minutes, he finally encountered a second water element creature. This was a massive ice turtle.

The ice turtle was 30 meters long, and its body was massive. There were also mysterious seals on its body, and it was extremely powerful. Ling Han had to expend some effort to kill it.

However, the water essence he obtained from it was also pitifully little, not much more than the colorful long fish from before.

Ling Han was depressed. He had spent several times the time to kill this ice turtle, but the gains he had obtained actually did not correspondingly increase. This was too unfair, wasn’t it?

After an hour, Ling Han finally used up all the air in the breath he was holding. He did not float back up, but rather entered into the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

In this place, he could breathe freely. Though the Essence Nurturing Gourd would not replenish his air supply, with how big the space in the gourd was, it was completely enough for him to enter and breathe in quite a number of times.

Most importantly, fighting monsters here required the continuous channelling of flame energy. This consumed a lot of Spiritual Power. Thus, after staying underwater for three days, Ling Han had no choice but to surface. He had to recover his spiritual power.

Coincidentally, a massive ice floe had appeared ahead of them.

Just how big was this block of ice?

It could more or less be called an island, with a diameter of six hundred meters. The part that surfaced from the water was actually flat.

No, this was not naturally formed, but had rather been forcefully flattened.

There were two people standing opposite each other on this icy mountain. Their robes fluttered in the wind, and both of them exuded an air of elegance and otherworldliness.

Looking at their gazes, his fighting spirit blazed like fire.

Were they fighting here?
