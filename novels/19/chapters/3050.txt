“Humph, you’re messing with my mind!” Hysteria was no longer in deep thought. “Once I capture you, I’ll be able to obtain all of your secrets.”

Boom! The cave wall broke open, and an army charged in.

“Hysteria, do you think this kind of trash can stop me?” Ling Han said with a smile. Although this was an army of Sixth Tiers, in front of him, what was it worth?

“You will find out,” Hysteria said calmly. When it came to patience, it was definitely superior to anyone else in the world.

It had lived through two generations of the Genesis World. Its lifespan was too long.

Hysteria’s army didn’t attack immediately. Those Sixth Tier elites were actually combining together, two of them merging into one, then merging again and again. Their numbers were decreasing, but the aura emitted by each of them was getting stronger and stronger.

It looked like they were intending to break through to the Seventh Tier.

Even if it was Hysteria, it had its limitations. It could only create Sixth-Tier life forms, and could not touch the Seventh Tier.

However, it had allowed its subordinates to possess Seventh-Tier battle prowess through another method.

They fused together.

Ling Han had seen this a long time ago, but this kind of fusion had a fatal weakness, and that was stability.

It wouldn’t last for long. At most three days, and the body would explode due to the terrifying power it contained.

Ling Han was unafraid. Firstly, his strength far surpassed ordinary Seventh Tiers. Secondly, this kind of Seventh Tier that was formed from fusion probably only had Seventh-Tier battle prowess, while the physique was far from reaching the Seventh Tier.

This was nothing to worry about at all.

Ling Han still stuck with his words. As long as Hysteria didn’t appear, he wasn’t afraid of anyone.

Very quickly, seven fusion monsters were fully formed, emitting the aura of the Seventh Tier.

In addition, there were even more monsters fusing together, wanting to create even more Seventh Tiers.

Ling Han stood with his hands behind his back, and said, “Hysteria, let’s talk seriously again! Don’t you think that being invincible is a very boring thing? You have something to do now, but so what if I really let you devour the Genesis World? How lonely would you be?”

“Foolish ant, you didn’t jump out of that well, so how do you know how big the world is?” Hysteria said coldly.

‘Eh, what does that mean?’

Ling Han’s heart skipped a beat, and he said, “You mean, you jumped out of this well and saw an even more exciting world?”

“Do you think I’ll tell you?” Hysteria sneered.

“Tell me about it. I think you’ve been holding it in for so long, so you should really want to share it with someone, right?” Ling Han said with a smile. “If you can tell me about it, I can also tell you the secret of the reappearance of your predecessor.”

“There’s no need!” Hysteria said coldly. “I’m invincible in the world. No secret can affect me.”

Damn, it was really not easy to deceive!

Ling Han sighed, and could only give up on the idea of getting information from Hysteria. With a long howl, he punched out, launching an attack towards Hysteria’s army.

At this moment, nine fusion monsters had already formed, which meant that there were nine beings with Seventh-Tier battle prowess, and they all charged towards Ling Han. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Boom!

A huge battle broke out between the two sides.

Ling Han was completely unafraid. There was a defensive light shield surrounding him, and if his body wasn’t damaged, then power that suppressed the Seventh Tier erupted when he punched out.

Boom! A Seventh Tier monster’s chest was instantly blasted through by him, but a terrifying light burst forth from its chest, forming a huge explosion.

The force of the explosion was truly terrifying. Ling Han was sent flying by the impact, and he crashed heavily into the wall of the cave, directly shattering it. His figure traveled backward repeatedly, and it was only when he crashed through three layers of the cave wall that the force of the impact finally receded.

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and the defense on his body was actually directly reduced by as much as 33 layers.

It had to be known that although this was still the same total of 100 layers, the defense of each layer was 10 times stronger than when he was at the Fifth Tier, which was equivalent to having 1,000 layers of defense.

Now that the 33 layers had been torn open, this meant that if he had still been in the Fifth Tier, this attack would at least have heavily injured him, and it wouldn’t have been strange for him to even have been directly killed.

Thank goodness, thank goodness.

Ling Han nodded in his heart. Fortunately, he hadn’t been blinded by his own strength and come here in a moment of hot-headedness when he had only been at the Fifth Tier.

Now, he had nothing to fear from these monsters.

With a thought, the defense that had been destroyed was restored to its original state. It was now completely flawless.

‘Die!’

He charged back, and as he brandished his fists, his terrifying battle prowess seethed.

Peng, peng, peng! Three Seventh Tier fusion monsters exploded together, turning into an energy storm that made it seem like it was the end of the world, sending Ling Han flying again.

Impressive!

Ling Han was flabbergasted. Three monsters exploding at the same time shaved off as many as 63 layers of his defenses.

How could it be so powerful?

He reflected on the situation in his mind, and immediately came to a realization. It turned out that there were many explosive monsters among these fusion monsters, and each of them had fused with at least 10 of these monsters. Their power was naturally terrifying.

Around him, there were still Sixth-Tier monsters fusing, but the number of exploding monsters was extremely small.

This was very normal. Even if it was Hysteria, it should be extremely difficult to create a monster with Seventh-Tier power. Even if it could unleash a burst of such power only once, it would still break some kind of restriction, so how could it be created on a large scale?

However, Ling Han had no intention of continuing the battle. No matter how many of these monsters he eliminated, it would be useless. At most he would be able to temporarily relieve the pressure on the secondary battlefield. It wouldn’t be long before the Hysteria Army recovered its scale, and the battle would resume.

‘In that case, I’ll destroy as much as I can before leaving.’

Ling Han charged out, trying his best to avoid the Seventh Tier monsters. If he really couldn’t avoid them, he would only clash head-on with them. This way, even if he was affected by the shock waves of the explosion, it wouldn’t be able to tear through his defenses.

Without a true immortal body, he would certainly have some concerns.

Ling Han sighed with emotion. He was clearly much stronger than Chong Yan and the others, but he had to be extremely careful when fighting these monsters, unlike Chong Yan and the others, who didn’t have to worry about their own safety at all.

Peng, peng, peng! The caves here were destroyed one by one. Ling Han’s main focus was to destroy those plants. They seemed to be mother trees which could continuously create monsters.

Destroying them should be able to greatly slow down Hysteria’s invasion.

As expected, after he focused his attacks on the plants, Hysteria was clearly enraged.

Previously, it had not made a move to deal with Ling Han. It seemed to have been held back by Lin Luo and the others, or perhaps it was for some other reason. However, now it swung out a tentacle, striking towards Ling Han.

Peng!

Ling Han didn’t cower, and chose to face it head-on. He wanted to know just how terrifying Hysteria’s attack was.

With a single strike, he was immediately sent flying, crashing through nine layers of cave wall before coming to a stop.

He took a look and couldn’t help but be shocked. There were only nine layers of defense left on his body.

If the power of Hysteria advanced a step further, or if its attacks became more concentrated, Ling Han’s defense would still become incomparably weak.

With a thought, his defenses were immediately replenished, and it instantly turned from dull to dazzling.

‘I’m done playing.’

Ling Han’s figure flashed. With Hysteria attacking, the situation would be completely different.

The strongest in the world was still Hysteria, an unshakeable existence.
