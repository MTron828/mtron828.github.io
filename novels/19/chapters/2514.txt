Chapter 2515: Nine Deaths Formation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han arrived before the martial academy.

While chatting with Tang Chi and Xu Qiang before, he had learned that entering the martial academy was actually extremely simple. As long as one was powerful enough, they could enter the martial academy any time they wanted.

They only needed to do one thing—pass the Nine Deaths Formation.

This formation sat at the gate of the martial academy, and as long as one managed to pass it, they would be able to enter the martial academy. At that time, someone would immediately come over to register them as a disciple of the martial academy.

This formation was called the Nine Deaths Formation, and it consisted of nine different levels in total, with each level being more difficult to pass than the previous. However, one only needed to pass the first level to enter the academy. There was no need to pass all nine levels.

It was said that the Nine Deaths Formation corresponded to the Nine Heavens of the Celestial King Tier. However, even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t necessarily be able to pass the first level of the Nine Deaths Formation.

Why was this?

This was because, in the first level of the Nine Deaths Formation, one’s cultivation level would be suppressed to the First Heaven. Thus, an advantage in cultivation level would be completely useless here.

The Nine Deaths Formation was extremely difficult to pass. Moreover, even though the Empress and the others had been brought over by Zhou Heng, they had still needed to challenge the Nine Deaths Formation. This was the rule of the martial academy. If one couldn’t pass this formation, they wouldn’t be able to enter the martial academy.

This was because the martial academy wouldn’t give disciples free pass tokens or similar things. Each time they entered the academy, they would need to challenge this formation.

If one couldn’t pass this formation with their own abilities, would they have the face to enter the martial academy?

The time it took for each person to pass the Nine Deaths Formation also varied greatly. The quicker one was, the better their result naturally was. Thus, there was also a ranking attached to this formation. It was said that only the most brilliant individuals could make it onto this ranking.

The Nine Deaths Formation had already existed for several epochs. Thus, it had already been challenged by countless prodigies, many of whom had created great legends and legacies.

......

As a result, trying to push into the rankings at this moment would be as difficult as trying to ascend the heavens. After all, this was equivalent to competing against countless prodigies from countless dimensions through countless generations.

Each day, there would be many people challenging the formation, dreaming of entering the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Becoming a disciple of this martial academy would be the greatest confirmation of their talent and the greatest glory they could experience.

A man walked over and asked Ling Han, “Little brother, are you also here to challenge the formation?”

There was a single ribbon of iridescent light around him. He was clearly a First Heaven Celestial King, yet he was wearing an amiable smile, and didn’t appear haughty or arrogant at all.

Ling Han nodded with a smile, replying, “Yes.”

The man was dressed in a green robe, and he looked to be around 30 years old. However, judging by his flame of life, he had already lived for at least several epochs. Thus, it wasn’t demeaning for him to refer to Ling Han as “little brother.”

The Celestial King was extremely astonished upon hearing this reply. This was because Ling Han didn’t look like a Celestial King at all. Was he here to seek death?

“Young friend, this is no place for you to muck around,” another person said. This was a beautiful female Celestial King.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “No worries, I know what I’m doing.”

“Haha, everything will be fine as long as you know what you’re doing?” another Celestial King said. He was dressed in black, and he was exuding an extremely dark and cold aura.

“Say, why are you people speaking so much nonsense with a young child?” a Celestial King with an extremely large head yet extremely small body said. He wore an expression of impatience.

“Just going off your courage alone, little friend, follow Big Sister, I’ll definitely protect you,” the female Celestial King said with a smile. Her expression was seductive and alluring.

Celestial Kings should have all possessed steel-strong willpowers. However, upon seeing the smile of this female Celestial King, the male Celestial Kings couldn’t help but feel enticed.

It was clear that she was skilled in the art of seduction and manipulation. Otherwise, she couldn’t have wavered the Celestial Kings no matter how beautiful she was.

Ling Han smiled indifferently, and said, “Sure!”

He entered the formation with the other Celestial Kings. Including him, there were seven people in total. Of course, there were naturally Celestial Kings who had entered before them, and there would naturally be Celestial Kings who entered after them.

The martial academy didn’t care about how many times they challenged the formation. Even if someone failed 10,000 times, they could still become a disciple if they eventually passed the formation. Of course, if they had only passed due to luck, they would most likely fail to re-enter the martial academy if they ever went out. At that time, it would be extremely embarrassing and awkward.

After entering the formation, the surroundings still appeared the same as before. It was as if the formation didn’t exist at all, and everything was only a lie.

However, the six Celestial Kings didn’t dare to let their guard down at all. They had already challenged this formation several times, so they naturally understood it very well—even though the formation would change slightly every time.

Ling Han secretly observed his own body, discovering that there was no restriction placed upon him. His state was the same as before.

According to rumors, one would have the chance to pass this formation as long as they were a First Heaven Celestial King. However, regardless of how freakish a First Heaven Celestial King was, their battle prowess could only reach the peak stage of the Third Heaven at a maximum. Thus, with Ling Han’s current strength at the Fifth Heaven, would he not be able to pass this formation with ease?

Because of this, he was extremely calm at this moment. If he still couldn’t pass this formation with such strength, would there still be reason in this world?

He clasped his hands behind his back, appearing as relaxed as could be.

“Humph, brat, even though Friend Plum Blossom is willing to help you, this doesn’t mean that you’re outstanding or whatnot. Quit pretending to be so relaxed and calm!” the Celestial King in black said in a cold voice. It was clear that he was slightly displeased.

F*ck! They were moving around in such a cautious manner, yet Ling Han appeared as if he were taking a leisurely stroll. Was he treating them as bodyguards?

They were bringing him over to expand his horizons, so he also had to fix up his attitude, no?

The female Celestial King glared at the Celestial King in black, and said, “Why are you arguing with a child?” She was the Plum Blossom Celestial King, and her beauty and fame were known far and wide. Countless Celestial Kings were trying to win her heart.

The Celestial King in black shut his mouth. However, there was a glimmer of killing intent in his eyes as he glanced at Ling Han.

Ling Han indeed hadn’t offended him. Whose fault was it that he was taking offense for no reason?

Anyhow, finding an opportunity to kill Ling Han here would be far too easy. The latter had yet to reach the Celestial King Tier, so killing him would be as easy as squashing an ant.

“Be careful, it’s about to begin!” the Celestial King in green said.

“Mm-hm!” Everyone nodded in acknowledgment. Even though the situation would be slightly different every time, the challenge would always begin around this area. The first battle was about to begin.

Sure enough, after taking another step, seven people suddenly appeared before them. Looking closely, these were seven wooden puppets. They had no eyes, no ears, and no nose. Their bodies were also filled with symbols that radiated with overwhelming pressure.

Wooden puppets could battle against Celestial Kings?

Ling Han looked toward the Celestial Kings, only to see that their expressions were still calm. It was clear that this first wave of enemies wasn’t powerful enough to trouble them.

The battle began. Sure enough, the seven wooden puppets all targeted a single person each. However, the six Celestial Kings teamed up to block all seven of them.

Without needing Ling Han to help, the six Celestial Kings quickly concluded the battle.

Ling Han found this strange. If cooperation was allowed, wouldn’t it be possible for powerful cultivators to bring weaker cultivators through the formation? After all, the martial academy had no rule against such cooperation.

There was most likely some other mechanism to deal with this.

They continued to push forward. The six Celestial Kings were extremely powerful when they teamed up, and they continued to brush through all challenges that they came across, not suffering a disadvantage even though they had to fight against seven opponents. It wasn’t long before they arrived in front of a foggy area. They all came to a halt.

“Little friend, it’s time for you to return,” the Plum Blossom Celestial King said with a smile. “After entering here, each person has to fight for themself, and it’s impossible to help others. So, your adventure ends here.”

Ling Han simply replied with a smile. He naturally couldn’t turn around and leave. Moreover, as it turned out, the true test only began here.

“Let’s go,” the Celestial King in green said, stepping forward to enter the fog. They had only been willing to bring Ling Han over for this “adventure” because of a sudden impulse. However, they naturally didn’t view him with much importance. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Celestial Kings entered the fog one by one, immediately vanishing from sight.

Ling Han was just about to step forward, yet he unexpectedly saw someone walking back out from the fog.

It was the Celestial King in black.

There was killing intent on his face, and he didn’t speak a single word as he swung his palm at Ling Han, aiming to kill this detestable insect.
