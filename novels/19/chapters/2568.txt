Chapter 2569: Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yet Sima Qing was completely unmoved. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King of medium build and average features. However, a Celestial King naturally would have the demeanor of a Celestial King, exuding astonishing pressure. Ascending Origin Tiers would be crushed even if they just came close to him.

“The battle… begins!” This time, the commentator did not dare to keep the audience hanging too long, and hurriedly announced the start of the battle.

With a wave of Sima Qing’s hands, a majestic light instantly shot into the skies, and a halberd appeared in his hands. The halberd was jet-black, but the tip of the halberd was crimson, with black Qi rising from it. It was like one could hear the shrill screaming of 10,000 ghosts coming from it.

Even if there was a protective formation around the battle area, preventing the shock waves of battle from rushing out of the allocated area, everyone still couldn’t help but pale. Not even the formation could fully block this sharp shrieking.

“Celestial Tool!” they exclaimed.

“Heavens, I have actually seen a Celestial Tool!”

“This is the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls that Lord Azure Ghost has once used!”

“I take back what I said. There is absolutely no such thing as throwing the match; there is definitely no throwing the match!”

“Having a Celestial Tool suppress him, are they trying to make it so that Li Long can’t even get eight wins in a row?”

Everyone exclaimed in shock. A considerable number of people could tell that the halberd in Sima Qing’s hands was a Celestial Tool. Furthermore, it was a supreme precious tool that had once been used by the Azure Ghost Celestial King at that!

Limited by his strength, there was no way that Sima Qing could release the strongest might of the Celestial Tool, but its power would still be at the Fifth Heaven at least, right?

Was that still not enough to suppress Ling Han?

Throwing the match? F*** throwing the match!

Zhao Shuang also lamented in regret. When he found out that Ling Han’s eighth opponent was Sima Qing, he also shared Tang Yuan’s opinion, and thought that the tournament authorities were planning to throw the match. Thus, he decisively refused to make a wager with Tang Yuan. That would purely be gifting money straight to the latter.

Who knew that there would be such a turn of events?

He should have made the wager!

Meanwhile, Tang Yuan’s expression was livid. This was a Celestial Tool—a weapon that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had once used at that. Its might would definitely be extremely frightening.

Was there any need to go so far? For better or worse, Tang Yuan was a character, so why didn’t they give him the slightest face at all?

This time, Ling Han was definitely in a dilemma.

Tang Yuan felt resentment. Even though he had won against Zhao Shuang twice, and had even taken the pay for Ling Han’s appearance for himself, what he had spent on Ling Han was even more than that. Did you think that there was no need to pass out bribes to mess around with the arrangements of the tournament so that Ling Han could appear in advance?

Tang Yuan hadn’t even recovered his capital. If Ling Han were to die now, it would definitely be a great loss for him.

“Damn it!” he mumbled.

In the arena.

Sima Qing pointed the halberd at Ling Han directly, and said, “Your mistake is that you are showing off too much, and have exhibited your full strength too early. Otherwise, it would not be difficult for someone of your strength to become a Blood Martial King.”

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Oh, do you think that I have already shown my full strength?”

He looked at the halberd in his opponent’s grip, his heart burning like fire.

This was a Celestial Tool. If he could take it for his own, and let the Divine Demon Sword devour it, the level of the Divine Demon Sword would definitely be able to advance another step ahead.

Divine Metal was rare and limited, and had to be accumulated piece by piece.

“Humph, even if you have still hidden your strength, under the suppression of the Celestial Tool, everything is meaningless,” Sima Qing declared disdainfully. He was not underestimating Ling Han, but rather had too much confidence in this Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls.

…This was a precious tool that had once been used by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so how could it not be awesome?

“Come!” Ling Han crooked a finger at his opponent. So what if it was a Celestial Tool? It would still depend on who the user was.

“How foolish!” Sima Qing humphed. He strode towards Ling Han, but his pace wasn’t very fast. With every step he took, the Celestial Tool was awakening, imposing great pressure on Ling Han.

This was deliberate. He wanted to make Ling Han shudder in fear because he knew that he was no match for Ling Han in a fair battle. Being able to bully an elite like Ling Han like this, he felt extremely pleased with himself.

Ling Han’s expression was solemn. Though he had pushed the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to the sixth layer of the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, it was still no match for Divine Metal. If he confronted Divine Metal head-on, he would definitely be experiencing a loss.

However, the Divine Demon Sword was one of his trump cards, and he did not want to reveal it so quickly.

Just in time; he wanted to try fighting in such dire conditions. This should be able to greatly improve his battle prowess.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Sima Qing was getting closer and closer. The seals on the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls lit up one after another. Skulls appeared, floating towards Ling Han, and opening their mouths to bite at him.

Ling Han balled his hand into a fist and threw a punch.?Peng

, a skull was immediately crushed. However, he, too, shuddered slightly. This skull contained great power—enough to affect him.

Furthermore, this was just a single skull. More skulls were appearing, and launching an offensive against Ling Han.

“Hahahaha, in front of the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls, how much are you worth?” Sima Qing brandished the halberd and attacked. Though these skulls could pose a threat to Ling Han, it was still necessary to attack directly with the Celestial Tool in order to truly defeat, or even kill, Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and grabbed a streak of great dao, which he smashed towards Sima Qing.

This was completely unreasonable as he was directly using brute force to suppress his opponent.

But Sima Qing knew that there was a very wide gap in strength between him and Ling Han. If he traded injury for injury with Ling Han, then even if the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls could kill Ling Han, Sima Qing would definitely die as well after sustaining a strike from Ling Han.

Hence, he had to parry.

He brandished the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls to meet the attack.?Boom, the Celestial Tool clashed with great dao, causing a burst of ripples through space.

Sima Qing felt like even his arms were trembling, and if it was not for the fact that the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls had already activated, dispersing the majority of power behind Ling Han’s attack, this clash would definitely be many times even more frightening, which caused a chill to come over his heart.

Just how strong was this man exactly?

However, now that things had reached this point, it was apparent that Sima Qing could no longer retreat. Otherwise, even if Ling Han was willing to spare him, Sima Qing would still be called to account by the tournament authorities. ‘Oh, we’ve already even given you a Celestial Tool, and you actually still shamefully surrendered and begged for mercy?’

“Die!” he roared ferociously, the power of a Celestial King surging. Sharp green blades appeared from the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls one after another. This was him having inserted his own power inside the Celestial Tool, further boosting its might.

Otherwise, he did not think that his own power could actually pose any threat to Ling Han.

“Whom can you kill?” Ling Han smirked coldly. He unfurled his Dao, an action very smooth and incredibly natural.

Even if Sima Qing had a Celestial Tool in hand, he still appeared really backed up.

It was not that the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls was not strong, but rather that Sima Qing was too weak. He was unable to fully unleash the might of the Celestial Tool.

“Yi, so strange. Li Long is clearly only a Third Heaven Celestial King, but why do I have the feeling that he seems like a supreme Celestial King of Ninth Heaven!”

“I have that kind of feeling too!”

“Ah, so do I.”

Everyone on the spectators’ seats was crying out in shock. They were indeed insane, but they were all genuine Celestial Kings. Which of them was an ordinary character?

“Cultivation level cannot be faked.”

“Then there is only one possibility.”

“…This brat has comprehended his own Dao!”

“Extraordinary genius! He is truly an extraordinary genius!”

Sima Qing went all out, but the gap in power was too wide. Even if he exerted even more effort, it was useless. He was very soon suppressed.

Ling Han used various kinds of Regulations proficiently, bringing extreme suffering to Sima Qing. If it were not for the fact that the Celestial Tool in his grip was capable of slicing apart all types of Regulations, Sima Qing would not have been able to block Ling Han’s strikes at all.

Yet the only question now was just how long he would be able to hold on for. Turning the situation around? That was absolutely impossible, unless the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls could activate fully, but that surely was unrealistic.

Sima Qing did not dare continue fighting. He began retreating. Now that the battle had come this far, it was enough to prove that he had done his best, and the possibility that he had gone easy on Ling Han did not exist. Furthermore, he was sure that he would be killed by Ling Han if the battle continued.

He fled, but Ling Han had already entered into an optimal stage. Regulations manifested into chains, which wrapped around Sima Qing tightly and securely.
