3003 Might of a Single Strike

Ling Han attacked continuously, but did not use all his strength. He wanted to make Sealed Emotion breathe his last breath in despair and helplessness.

Just how arrogant had this bastard been in the past?

This was karma.

“Ling Han, stop!” Xin Qihu called out. He was the first to move, and joined forces with Feng Wuding to stop Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and slightly increased his power, blocking the two great prodigies. Meanwhile, his other hand continued to attack Heavenly Venerable Sealed Emotion.

‘F*ck!’

Witnessing such a scene, everyone’s eyes were bulging.

It didn’t matter that they were not familiar with the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier. However, as long as they had eyes, they could easily tell that Ling Han was more than powerful enough to battle against two opponents at the same time. Otherwise, how could he still have the leisure to attack Heavenly Venerable Sealed Emotion?

Feng Wuding and Xin Qihu both roared in fury and tried their best, but it was useless. In front of Ling Han’s power of peak-stage Seventh Tier, even though it was only a difference of the late stage versus the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, there was still an incomparable gap.

Pu, Sealed Emotion sustained this blow, and blood spurted from all over his body. He could only exhale, and no longer inhale.

If he sustained another blow, he would definitely die.

“Brother Ling, don’t make a grave mistake!” Lin Youlian also rushed over.

In her heart, of course the importance of Ling Han surpassed the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s. In fact, she didn’t even know who the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was. However, it was precisely because she valued Ling Han that she couldn’t allow Ling Han to make such a grave mistake. Otherwise, if a question of principle was touched, no one would be able to save him.

…However, she did not know that Ling Han had actually already started a massacre long ago.

Wu Haoyang moved as well. Four people with Seventh-Tier battle prowess had joined forces to fight Ling Han.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The four prodigies worked together, and finally managed to block Ling Han. However, this was only just enough to tie with Ling Han, which was still not enough insurance. There were a few times that Ling Han almost broke out of the siege successfully, which rendered their blockade ineffective.

“Big Brother, sorry!” Bai Mifan also let out a battle cry and joined the battle.

He hoped even less that Ling Han would stand on everyone’s opposing side. After all, Ling Han was still not a Seventh Tier yet. If he really provoked all Seventh Tiers into joining forces against him, that would definitely be a path of death.

Thus, Bai Mifan definitely had to stop Ling Han from committing murder.

Ling Han revealed a slight smile. His fighting spirit had finally been roused.

“Come!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and all the seventh-grade seals channeled, instantly increasing his power by 2,000 times.

Peng, peng, peng. He exchanged blows with Xin Qihu and the others. With the protection of the Powers of Dimension, the rebound could not take effect on his body at all. His body was like a Seventh Tier’s, indestructible and undying.

With his display of might, Xin Qihu and the others couldn’t bear it anymore.

They hurriedly channeled their respective strongest Heavenly Venerable Seals, meeting Ling Han’s attack.

“Suppress!” Feng Wuding roared loudly. He released his dimensions, which created a powerful pressure.

100 lower-tier high-level dimensions appeared at the same time, forming a terrifying pressure. Even Xin Qihu and the others were slightly affected.

Ling Han cracked a smile. “Since they have been released, don’t take them back!”

He launched a powerful offensive, brandishing the Fists of Fury and unleashing his full power.

With the strength of his present defenses, the pressure caused by the group of dimensions would not be the slightest bit effective on him.

Ling Han forcefully grabbed a dimension, intending to snatch it away. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Feng Wuding was both shocked and furious. If his dimension was really taken by Ling Han, then he would lose it forever.

He hurriedly unleashed his full power, wanting to retrieve this dimension.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han said coldly. A terrifying power surged, forcibly compressing this dimension, and shrinking it to the size of a palm. He grabbed it, and then threw it out heavily.

Peng!

This dimension directly assaulted the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, as fast as a streak of light.

Sealed Emotion was greatly shocked, and his eyes involuntarily widened, revealing a powerful fear.

When this attack reached him, he would definitely die.

He didn’t want to die.

After so many years of hard cultivation, he had cultivated from his initial level of the First Tier to his present level of Fourth Tier, and he had only spent over an epoch. This talent was truly amazing.

He still had higher hopes for himself. Perhaps, he could reach the Fifth Tier, or even Sixth Tier, but if he was hit by this attack, then everything would be for naught.

But to say nothing of the fact that he was already heavily injured, even if his battle prowess was undamaged, what ability would he have to dodge or parry the attack of a Seventh Tier?

He could only place his hopes on Feng Wuding and the others. However, could Feng Wuding and the others stop Ling Han?

They couldn’t!

This blow was as fast as a streak of light, and Ling Han had even taken the initiative to attack, detaining all five elites so that they had no time to interfere.

Peng! The dimension crushed the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable into pieces, and this dimension crashed into the city wall. The defense that could have blocked the attack of a Sixth Tier instantly crumbled, revealing a massive hole. As a result, this dimension also crumbled into over a dozen pieces, which continued to advance forwards.

Because it had crumbled, the core power had gone berserk, and this dimension was beginning to grow larger.

Just how large was a lower-tier high-level dimension?

Boom! As it continued to charge forward, heaven and earth would truly collapse.

Coincidentally, the base of Hysteria’s troops was in that direction as well.

So what if there was a distance of 5000 km between them? In less than the time for a single breath, these massive dimensional shards had already arrived. Those Heavenly-Venerable-Tier monsters were completely unprepared. A calamity instantly arrived. With a single blow, this base no longer existed, and who knew how many of Hysteria’s troops had been killed or wounded.

Meanwhile, the remaining dimensional shards continued to fly forward, entering the territory controlled by Hysteria. As for what damage they could cause, that was only something that Hysteria needed to worry about.

On the side of the Profound Negative Realm, everyone was gaping and dumbfounded, stunned by Ling Han.

Firstly, they were stunned because of Ling Han’s strength—even the battle prowess of five great elites with Seventh-Tier battle prowess couldn’t stop him from killing. Secondly, Ling Han was too brazen. As long as one wasn’t a Seventh Tier, he wasn’t truly invincible. He actually dared to kill people in the camp, and not just one at that.

This time, he had really gotten into big trouble. Who would be able to save him?

Feng Wuding’s expression was baleful, and he did not make another move, because Sealed Emotion was already dead, and it looked like even if the five elites joined forces, they would not be able to suppress Ling Han, so what was the point of fighting? He pointed at Ling Han, and said, “You have already caused a great calamity. Are you going to kneel down and be restrained, or should we act?”

Ling Han cracked a smile. “I have no plans to be restrained, nor can I be restrained. There is still another person I have to kill!”

As he said this, he stared fixedly at Feng Wuding.

He had tolerated this guy for long enough. Today, he was definitely going to kill him!

Feng Wuding faltered for a moment, and then laughed loudly. “Ling Han, your opinion of yourself is too high. You still want to kill me?”

“If I wish it, you will be a dead man!” Ling Han said calmly, revealing a powerful confidence in his voice.

“Ling Han, not only did you publicly commit murder in the encampment, you even damaged the city defense. What kind of serious crime is this?” Feng Wuding continued to rebuke Ling Han. On the other hand, Lin Youlian and the others all fell silent.

As if to illustrate Feng Wuding’s words, endless killing intent rushed over, and a large number of Hysteria’s troops surged over from all directions.
