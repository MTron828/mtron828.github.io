2780 Yuan Yinglong’s Invitation

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Then what’s the second condition?”

Yuan Yinglong didn’t reply straight away. Instead, he started to tell a story, saying, “Several epochs ago, an earth-shattering battle took place. At that time, a chaotic spatial overlap suddenly occurred between the fourth spatial level and this level, resulting in a large number of Third Tier elites from Hysteria’s army appearing here.

“At that time, the Power of Dimension of the second level was extremely unstable. It was sometimes able to host those at the Third Tier, yet it was at other times unable to.

“Our camp at that time was also further ahead than it is now. However, it was quickly breached by Hysteria’s army, and we were forced into a rapid retreat.

!!

“After some time, we received reinforcements from the fourth level. It was only then that we were finally able to consolidate our position and engage in an intense final battle with Hysteria’s army.

“Too many people, far too many, died in that battle.

“And just as the battle was about to conclude, another spatial change suddenly occurred. The entire battlefield vanished, and those who were still alive all attempted to escape the space. The two dimensions pressed together like a mill, and even Third Tier Heavenly Venerates would be easily killed if they were caught.

“Countless years later, this space has actually emerged again!

“It hasn’t completely appeared yet, but according to the estimates of the great elites, with the death of so many Third Tier Heavenly Venerates and with countless years of their powers intertwining together, it’s very likely that Heavenly Venerable Seals have been formed!”

After telling this story, Yuan Yinglong looked intently at Ling Han, and said, “Brother Ling, I want to invite you to explore this mystery realm and search for Heavenly Venerable Seals with me.”

Being something that could increase the speed of one’s cultivation, Heavenly Venerable Seals were far too important. Those like Lin Youlian and Wu Haoyang had definitely mastered a large number of Heavenly Venerable Seals. Otherwise, they couldn’t have surged to the Fourth Tier in just a measly one billion years.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before replying, “Very well, then I’ll have a look.”

Yuan Yinglong was delighted upon hearing this. In reality, he only had a small bit of renown in the second spatial level, and his battle record was only just enough for him to enter the recent leaderboard, placing him in the 900s. Compared to those in his native dimension, he was naturally paramount and unrivaled. Here, however, there were many people stronger than him.

Obtaining Heavenly Venerable Seals could increase his battle prowess and also increase the speed of his cultivation. However, far too many people had their eyes on that place, so it was hard to say whether he could have the last laugh.

With Ling Han’s help, his chance of success was naturally far greater.

Ling Han wore a faint smile as he looked at Yuan Yinglong. This person was fairly thorough in his planning and actions.

If Yuan Yinglong had won, he naturally wouldn’t have invited Ling Han. At the same time, he would have avenged his underlings and strengthened his prestige and reputation as their boss. If he lost, however, he could still obtain a powerful helper.

It was no wonder he had carried himself with such an honorable demeanor. As it turned out, he had already planned for both possibilities.

Yuan Yinglong also smiled, though his smile was slightly awkward. He knew that Ling Han had seen through him.

Ling Han waved his hand before calmly leaving.

After arriving at the foot of the mountain and returning with the others, he told them of the situation regarding the mystery realm.

“That’s extremely dangerous!” Bewitching Maiden Rou immediately said. “Who knows whether a spatial overlap will occur again, resulting in the arrival of a large number of Third Tier elites from Hysteria’s army.”

The Empress also nodded in agreement. She knew that Ling Han was powerful enough to rival Third Tier Heavenly Venerates, perhaps even 10 at once. However, if Hysteria dispatched an army, would there only be a measly 10 or 20 Third Tier elites?

Thus, the possibility of a spatial overlap was an extremely dangerous proposition.

Ling Han naturally knew this as well. “This opportunity can’t be missed. A single Heavenly Venerable Seal can result in a cultivation speed difference of several folds.”

After advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, even their Physique of Time had been rendered useless. Indeed, Regulations had no effect on Heavenly Venerates.

Thus, advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier was much like starting from zero again. No one had any advantage, and everything was determined by one’s hard work and luck.

Seeing that Ling Han had already made a decision, the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou didn’t try to persuade him anymore.

“Moreover, since a large number of Heavenly Venerates died in that place, there are definitely many Heavenly Venerate Tools. I’ll grab a few for you guys,” Ling Han said.

It was possible that Heavenly Venerable Seals existed in the mystery realm. However, this was only speculation from others. Meanwhile, it was almost certain that there were many Heavenly Venerate Tools, regardless of whether they had been smashed into shards or not. In any case, they had all been forged from Devouring Metal, so it was entirely possible to fuse a few of them together to forge a new tool.

Ling Han also informed the Rain Emperor, Yi, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the others about this situation, allowing them to decide whether they wanted to go or not.

After a dozen or so days, Yuan Yinglong came over to inform Ling Han that they were about to set off.

And thereupon, Ling Han also brought his companions with him as he set off. In addition to him and the Empress, there was also Ling Jianxue, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, Yi, the Rain Emperor, the large black dog, and… the black donkey.

“What’s with your expressions, little brats? Can’t this lord go, huh?” The black donkey huffed when he saw everyone’s strange expression.

“Senior, as someone who accompanies Lord Zhou Heng, how can you be short of Heavenly Venerable Seals?” Ling Han asked with a smile. Even though he was already at the First Tier and far more powerful than the black donkey, he was a person who treasured old ties, so he still treated the black donkey with respect.

The black donkey sighed, and said, “Do you people know how Heavenly Venerable Seals are passed on? They’re directly dug out from one’s divine sense, causing one to lose it forever. In other words, Heavenly Venerable Seals can only be passed on. They can’t be taught.

“That brat Zhou Heng dug out three Heavenly Venerable Seals for this lord, but just what kind of donkey am I? Will I be willing to receive so many benefits from that brat?”

Everyone was rendered speechless. In fact, even the large black dog started to whistle as he turned his head to the sky.

The large black dog and the black donkey were both as despicable and depraved as could be, yet the black donkey actually dared to say that he was unwilling to receive too many benefits from someone? Just how shameless could he be?

In any case, the black donkey wasn’t afraid to let everyone know that he possessed three Heavenly Venerable Seals. After all, they were from Zhou Heng, so who dared to covet them?

In fact, Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates could resist the pressure caused by the overlap of two dimensions, so they could directly charge from the first level through to the seventh level, their battle prowess not diminishing in the process. That being the case, who dared to provoke such a paramount being?

Thus, even though the black donkey was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, he was even more imposing and impressive than many Fourth Tier and Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates. This was because everyone was aware of his good relationship with Zhou Heng; they were like brothers.

Yuan Yinglong also brought along his own underlings. They were all embarrassed when they saw Ling Han, and they all offered their apologies. It was clear that they had already been instructed by Yuan Yinglong on what to do.

“Let’s go. Many people have their eyes set on that place, so we can’t waste any time,” Yuan Yinglong said.

Once a Heavenly Venerable Seal was mastered by someone, it could only be passed on and not taught. Thus, they had to immediately observe and study these seals the moment they appeared.

They set off, heading toward the depths of where the two dimensions collided.

After entering the war with Hysteria, their defensive lines had continued to retreat again and again. Even though the Flaming Frost Realm was extremely large, there would eventually come a day when they would have nowhere else to retreat.

Upon thinking of this, everyone became solemn and silent. At the same time, they also felt an intense thirst for paramount power that could turn the tables on Hysteria.

The further they ventured, the darker their surroundings became. The environment gradually became grotesque and bizarre, appearing completely different from the Flaming Frost Realm that they were familiar with.

This was because this region was being assimilated and engulfed by Hysteria. As a result, the Regulations of the Flaming Frost Realm were no longer effective here. It was as if they had entered a different dimension.

Everyone felt uneasy. They couldn’t draw on the Power of Dimensions, nor could they replenish their own power. This was an extremely dangerous situation.

Fortunately, this area hadn’t been fully assimilated by Hysteria, after all, so there was still a sliver of power from the Flaming Frost Realm. This affected their battle prowess and their recovery speed, but it was definitely still better than nothing.

Three months later, they finally arrived at their destination.
