Chapter 1102: Reward

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

10th stage.

If there were no hidden surprises, the destructive ability of the stone statues would reach the same level as Xia Wuque and the others. This was almost impossible to defeat.

One had to realize that no one in this galaxy had formed five Mountains and Rivers. Thus, a power of six stars was already the strongest. Anyhow, how many prodigies could reach a power of six stars? In order to reach this level, they had to open the sky from a small world!

Even if there were more of these prodigies in addition to Xia Wuque and the three others, they most likely numbered in the single digits. There wouldn’t be too many of them.

Now, however, tens of thousands of stone statues that possessed a destructive ability on this level were ruthlessly attacking Ling Han!

Xia Wuque and the three other prodigies involuntarily sucked in cold breath. If it were them, they would only be able to last for a few seconds under such relentless and ruthless attacks. If they didn’t use their trump cards, it was even possible that they would be unable to flee from the formation.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was finally being challenged.

Not only would blood spurt from his body when he was punched by the stone statues, but his flesh would also crack open. In fact, even his Godly bones became covered in a web of cracks. They didn’t break, but if he were punched a few more times, they definitely wouldn’t be able to remain intact!

How many stone statues were in this formation?

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Divine patterns dazzled, and fists flew about.

Pa, pa, pa!

The sound of bones breaking continuously traveled out from Ling Han’s body. The sound was especially clear even though he was engaged in such an intense battle.

“He definitely can’t hold on anymore!”

Everyone experienced jealousy, especially prodigies who believed that they were number one in the world. They naturally wished that no one could surpass themselves.

Thus, even Shao Sisi and the two other prodigies who had no conflicts with Ling Han didn’t want to see him pass—their self-confidence would take a huge hit if he could pass while they couldn’t.

Right now, Ling Han suffered broken bones with each step that he advanced. How could he possibly pass the last stage?

He would only end up being smashed into a pulp if he stubbornly continued forward.

A cold sneer appeared on Xia Wuque’s face. Right now, he truly wished that Ling Han’s willpower would be more resolute. If Ling Han continued, it would spare him the trouble of having to deal with him himself—Ling Han’s defense was too freakish, and even he wasn’t confident that he could kill him.

Although this wouldn’t sate his resentment enough, who was he? Did he need to bother so much with a lowly commoner?

He would be happy as long as Ling Han died.

Ling Han continued to shed blood as he advanced. His body had already distorted significantly—the attacks from the stone statues were too concentrated, and even the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll couldn’t heal his wounds in time. The second and third wave of attacks arrived at this time, and these caused his wounds to become even more severe. His Godly bones mended, yet they did so in incorrect places.

However, this didn’t matter, as they would be immediately broken or crushed again. Ling Han barely had time to breathe.

‘There’s still... half a stage!’ Ling Han silently took note of his progress in his mind. He had already completed half of the 10th stage, and this filled him with confidence. He used a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, which instantly healed all of his wounds.

He roared loudly and immediately increased his speed.

‘F*ck!’

The spectators by the two sides were all dumbfounded. Meanwhile, a string of curses raced through their minds.

‘Freak, this person is definitely a freak!

‘You looked like you were just about to fail, yet you suddenly became energetic and filled with vigor again... Are you messing with us on purpose?’

Ling Han stopped attacking, and unleashed his divine patterns of gravity with all his might. His legs became a blur as he raised his speed to an extreme.

Six-tenths, seven-tenths, eight-tenths, nine-tenths!

The finish line was in sight.

Everyone watched on in suspense. Although Ling Han had suddenly unleashed a burst of explosive power, the attacks of the stone statues weren’t becoming any weaker. He was beaten beyond recognition in no time, his broken bones becoming exposed and clear for all to see.

Was he still a person? He looked like a pile of mangled flesh!

However, this pile of mangled flesh was still charging forward. At the same time, Ling Han’s Godly bones emitted a dazzling radiance that was filled with an aura of eternity.

‘Last 10 steps!

‘Charge!’

Ling Han gritted his teeth.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

He was ruthlessly attacked, and he felt like he were about to die. Right now, he really wanted to seek refuge in the Black Tower. However, he had already made it so far, so how could he give up?

Fortunately, he had crippled himself several times when he had undergone a heavenly tribulation. Thus, he was already a little accustomed to this kind of pain. Otherwise, it was genuinely possible that he would have lost his consciousness due to the pain.

He circulated another drop of Indestructible True Fluid. However, even the effects of the Indestructible True Fluid would decrease significantly when used in quick succession. It was only enough to help him hang on.

Eight steps, five steps, three steps...

Ling Han roared and charged toward the finish line.

Weng!

His surroundings suddenly became pitch-black.

Ling Han lay on the floor, and he discovered that the stone statues around him had all disappeared. However, the spectators on the two sides weren’t here, either. It appeared as if he had entered another space with his final leap.

Peng!

A stone tablet appeared, seemingly cut from white jade. It was even radiating a gentle glow.

There were words on the stone tablet.

Ling Han didn’t read them, instead choosing to heal his wounds first.

He raised his head to look at the stone tablet after recovering some of his battle prowess.

“When I was young, I charged into the Puppet Sect alone, destroying all 1,000,000 of their puppets. This feat was ranked first in all of history. This is a duplicate of that formation, and I laid it so that the future generations can remember my greatness... Person of the future, although you passed this formation, you must realize that I’ve already decreased the battle prowess of the stone statue formation by a significant margin!

“However, since you were able to pass, you’re just strong enough to be worthy of praise. You possess some of my demeanor, so I’ll grant you some rewards. Make sure to remember my might and generosity!”

There weren’t many words, and Ling Han was able to read through it quickly. He couldn’t help but grimace. The person who’d left this stone tablet was far too narcissistic. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

‘I’m only at the high extreme now, so when I reach the consummate level—I don’t even need to reach the peak stage—my Godly bones will soar to reach a strength of Level Five Godly metal. What would it matter even if this stone statue formation were 10 times more powerful?

‘Whatever, there’s no point in arguing with someone who’s already dead for heaven knows how long.’

Ling Han shook his head. He raised his gaze above the stone tablet as this was where his reward was.

‘I don’t even know the name of that narcissistic person.’

Ling Han found four items above the stone tablet—three sheets of paper and a black metallic ball.

“Vajra Seal, Lion Seal, Quick Cloud Seal... and what the hell is this ball?”

Fortunately, there were still some words on the back of the stone tablet that described the uses of the four items.

“The Vajra Seal acts on the body and can raise one’s defenses to the pinnacle of the Sun Moon Tier! Gasp! This is amazing. ‘The Vajra Seal can be used between one to 10 times, depending on the length of time the seal is activated during each usage.’”

Ling Han picked the Vajra Seal up. There were strange symbols drawn on the seal, and it exuded an ancient and heavy aura.

“Is this for real?” Ling Han weighed the seal in his hand, and said, “If the description is to be believed, I don’t have to be afraid even when I’m facing Sun Moon Tier elites. However, it’s extremely likely that I’ll be digging my own grave if this old senior is kidding around with me!”

This was entirely possible. One could tell that the old senior was insanely narcissistic and a little out of touch just by reading the message that he had left on the stone tablet.

“When activated, the Lion Seal can raise one’s power to the pinnacle of the Sun Moon Tier. It can also be used between one to 10 times.

“The Quick Cloud Seal can raise one’s speed to the pinnacle of the Sun Moon Tier. It can also be used between one to 10 times.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!”

Ling Han picked the black metallic ball up, and murmured, “This is actually a Sun Moon Tier puppet? Unbelievable...”

He looked at the instructions on the stone tablet, and then tossed the black metallic ball into the air after pressing it a few times.

The metallic ball instantly transformed, growing larger and larger. Its shape also changed, and arms and legs started to extend from the ball. It wasn’t long before it transformed into a metallic person.
