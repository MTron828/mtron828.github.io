3141 Four times of overlapping power

Without the cultivation level of Ten Meridians, it was really very difficult to interfere in the battle between two king tiers.

However, the Nine Meridians could only circle around and fight. The python’s skin was thick and tough, and it was extremely powerful. If one was swept by its tail or its body collided with them, their skin would definitely split open and bones would be broken.

Right now, there were only nine people who were truly battling. Aside from Sima Rong, the other eight people were all at the cultivation level of Nine Meridians. As for the others? They were truly minor characters.

Ling Han didn’t make a move. Since they were competing to see who could kill the giant python, why was he rushing so quickly?

He was observing the giant python’s attacks, and he could clearly see the weak points in its attacks.

—He had just lost power, but his insight and judgement would not decrease. Add to that the fact that he was cultivating the Demonic Monkey Fists. What kind of superior technique was this? It was really nothing difficult for him to see through the attack of a mere Ten Meridians.

It wasn’t long before Ling Han saw through the giant python’s attack patterns. A smile involuntarily tugged at the corners of his lips.

“Get lost! Get lost! You trash, don’t get in my way!” Sima Rong roared loudly. Peng, peng, peng, two punches shot out, and actually sent the two cultivators that were blocking in front of him flying. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Previously, they had only been sent flying by the force he had released, so it was understandable. After all, he hadn’t directly attacked anyone. Now, however, it was a completely different story. The two sect elders of these two cultivators instantly wore furious expressions.

They all looked towards Cao Cong. This was a member of Blue Feather Cit, so they naturally had to demand an explanation from Cao Cong.

Cao Cong merely stroked his beard and smiled, “It is a competition, so it is inevitable that there would be some stumbling over one another.”

“Take one of my ‘Break Dragon Flash’!” Sima Rong leaped up high, and pulled back his right fist, as if he was accumulating power. Visibly, there were layers of light wrapped around his fist.

“What?!” the elites exclaimed in astonishment.

After advancing into Ten Meridians, one could release their power, and could be called a king tier. However, power was invisible, and could not be seen with the naked eye. Now, Sima Rong’s punch actually had a halo of light wrapped around it. That was a scene that would only appear when power was compounded.

A Ten Meridians’ power was already terrifying enough. From 30,000 kilograms at the very least, their peak could reach 50,000 kilograms. With this added together, how terrifying would their destructive power be?

What kind of technique was this Break Dragon Flash? So impressive!

Ling Han’s eyes also flashed. Though his power had exceeded 50,000kg, he definitely could not overlap his power like this. However, within the Demonic Monkey Fists, this was actually a very ordinary technique. However, limited by his cultivation level, Ling Han was still unable to do this.

This kind of layering did not mean that the power of 50,000 kilograms would become 100,000 kilograms, or 200,000 kilograms. Instead, it was a continuous barrage of attacks, with practically no pause.

Peng, Sima Rong’s figure descended, and a heavy punch landed.

Even if the giant python was an anomaly, with naturally thick skin and tough flesh, it still couldn’t withstand such a bombardment. With a shake of its massive snake’s head, its whole body was sent flying in a slanting arc.

A large part of the place where his fist landed had clearly caved in, as if it had been harshly struck by a massive rock, and one could imagine just how painful it had to be with one look.

“It should be overlapping power four times.” Ling Han judged. He had seen in the Demonic Monkey Fists that the limit of overlapping power was 108 layers. This naturally far surpassed Sima Rong..

‘I have to reach Ten Meridians as soon as possible. Only then would I be able to release my power, and cultivate the power of overlap,’ Ling Han thought. Otherwise, if it was power alone that reached Ten Meridians, he still could not be called a king tier.

“Hiss, this is overlapping five layers of power, right?” someone among the king tiers also exclaimed in shock.

“There aren’t as many as five layers, it should be four layers of overlapped power,” Meng Ruining said in a deep voice. He was a Twelve Meridians, so he could see things more clearly.

“Four layers is already terrifying enough,” the old woman said, her eyes burning. The gaze she directed at Sima Rong was a little strange.

“Hehe, among the techniques we’ve obtained, we can only stack three layers of power at most.” Old Venom chuckled, and said, “Cao Cong, you’re really hiding your strength!”

Sima Rong was brought here by Cao Cong, and all his abilities must have been taught by Cao Cong.

However, no one knew how stunned Cao Cong was at this moment.

He had indeed taught Sima Rong, but he had definitely not taught him anything about the Break Dragon Flash that could overlap power four times — if he really grasped this kind of secret technique, he would definitely treat it as his trump card. He would definitely not pass it on until the moment of his death.

This disciple had gone out to train for a few years, so why had it become that he did not even recognize him after his return?

“Hahaha, a mere Demonic Beast, you think you can be insolent in front of me?” Sima Rong was more and more arrogant. He charged out, and blasted the giant python madly.

Under the suppression of the four layers of power, it was equivalent to having four Sima Rong attacking it at the same time. Even if the giant python was a Demonic Beast, and was born stronger than humans in terms of physique, it could only match two to three Ten Meridians at most, but four? It definitely couldn’t beat them.

Hence, the giant python was instantly blasted into a sorry state, leaving behind pieces of scales on the ground.

In a one-on-one situation, being able to suppress a Demonic Beast of the same cultivation level was really too shocking.

The younger generation were all convinced. If they were to fight a Demonic Beast of the same cultivation level, it was absolutely impossible that they would have such a crushing advantage.

“Don’t be discouraged!” Sun Jianfang said. “Before Ten Meridians, it’s indeed very difficult for us cultivators to contend with Demonic Beasts, because the natural conditions of our bodies are too different. However, as long as we advance into Ten Meridians and can release our power, and the technique we cultivate can truly begin to show its might, this is the true time for cultivators to rise.”

Hearing his words, the youngsters finally regained their fighting spirit.

They were inferior to Sima Rong, not because they were inferior in natural talent, but rather because they had not reached Ten Meridians yet.

However, the older generation shook their heads internally. This was not just a gap in cultivation level, but also a difference in technique. For example, the technique they cultivated could only reach three overlapping layers of power.

Even though there was only one less overlapping layer of power, how could three against four be the same?

They naturally would not say these words, to avoid damaging the confidence of these young people. After all, they were all their descendants and disciples.

The king tiers of the older generation all shook their heads. Looks like there should be no doubt about Sima Rong’s victory, and he was now Ten Meridians. If he ingested the Volcanic Fruit, wouldn’t he immediately become Eleven Meridians?

Hiss, a twenty-four to twenty-five year-old Eleven Meridians king tier was too inconceivable.

Xiu, he charged out.

“Hahaha!” Ji Yuanlong laughed loudly, and said, “Old geezer Sun, I thought your disciple was as cowardly as a mouse and didn’t even dare to attack. Looks like I was wrong. This brat isn’t cowardly, but rather slow in reaction, and not just by a little at that.”

All the elites laughed loudly. Since Sima Rong’s victory was already a foregone conclusion, there was no harm in having some fun.
