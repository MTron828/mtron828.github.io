Chapter 1647: Bone

A bone as white as jade was actually following him?

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. This was really too ridiculous.

Furthermore, this bone was really too human; it actually knew to hide from him—and it really had hidden successfully. If Ling Han had not turned around all of a sudden like this, he definitely would not have been able to seize it.

Ling Han descended, and was only about three meters away from that bone, but he did not make a move. Even if it was only a bone, he could still feel a terrifying aura from it, so he did not dare to make any rash movements.

The bone also seemed to be looking at him. Then, it shook its “body”, and actually slowly buried itself in the ground as if it was going to pretend that Ling Han had not discovered it, and was planning to make its getaway.

“Hey, I saw you!” Ling Han declared with a smile. Otherwise, he really didn’t know what kind of attitude he should adopt towards such a strange bone.

The bone suddenly popped back up, as if it had gotten a scare. It could be seen that its “body” had actually bent, clearly expressing its shock.

This... Ling Han began to break out in a cold sweat again. Could anyone tell him what was going on exactly with this bone?

“Can you speak?” he asked, and when he asked this question, even he himself felt it was a strange question to ask.

“Can, you, speak?” Unexpectedly, this bone really replied. However, it was not speaking verbally, but rather communicating through divine sense.

It seemed like an infant that was just learning to speak, its voice incredibly soft and childish.

“My name is Ling Han, do you have a name?” Ling Han asked.

“My, name, is, Ling, Han...” The bone repeated Ling Han’s words again, but its speed was considerably slower.

Ling Han could feel a headache coming on. This bone seemed to have somehow gained consciousness and become intelligent, yet it was in the beginning stage of just starting to understand. Thus, it didn’t even know how to speak, and knew only to repeat his words.

He sighed, and sat cross-legged on the ground.

The bone did not move, but it was visible that its upper half slightly bent, as if it was slanting its head to one side. Then, it, too, wanted to sit down, but it did not have legs to cross, so it could only bury half the bone into the ground so that it, too, looked like it was sitting down.

This was like a puppy that was imitating those around it.

Ling Han talked with it, and did not touch on any important topics. He only wanted it to have more contact with words, hoping that it could truly have its own voice.

“Yiyaya, yiyaya!” Half a day later, the bone finally was no longer continuing to copy his words, and said a phrase that belonged to it alone, yet it was completely meaningless. But it seemed very happy.

“Yiyaya, yiyaya!” it repeated endlessly.

“Can you speak now?” Ling Han asked.

“Can, you, speak, now? Yiyaya!” the bone replied happily.

Fine, it was a waste of his breath to even ask.

However, this bone was not so “afraid” of him now, so Ling Han could approach closer and examine it more clearly.

This bone was considerably extraordinary—it was nothing so simple as having gained intelligence. The bone was not only snow white, it was also jade-like, not having the slightest feeling of malice, as if it was a delicate piece of art yet the tastes of that grandmaster that had made it were too weird, and that was why he had made it into the shape of a bone.

On the surface of the bone, there were multiple patterns that were extremely complicated. Ling Han only looked at them for a while, and he was already dizzy. They were even harder to comprehend than the Celestial Formation he had obtained.

What relation did this bone have with that Celestial corpse on the summit?

It was only when Ling Han was descending the mountain that he gained that strange feeling. This bone should have appeared when he had been spying on that Celestial corpse. It probably sensed Ling Han’s gaze, and had thus followed him all the way here.

Others could not have reached that kind of height, so they naturally could not have possibly alerted this bone.

The bone was a part of that celestial corpse? And had somehow gained consciousness?

Was he a magnet for trouble?

Ling Han reflected on himself. The ancient sites that others went to were all normal, but when it was him, there was practically none that was actually normal!

“Do you eat anything?” Ling Han drew out some food to eat, and took out a portion, which he placed in front of the bone.

The bone looked at it with a cocked head, and very much wanted to eat like how Ling Han was eating, but it did not have any mouth, and so could not eat in the same way at all. It was so anxious that it began to call out “yiyaya” again, yet was completely helpless. It seemed to have been angered, and suddenly shot out a green-colored light which landed on the food.

Pa, this portion of food immediately turned into nothing.

“Yiyaya!” The bone once again called out in happiness. Its mood improved all of a sudden.

It really had quite a temper!

Ling Han was surprised; the power of this green light was very strong! No, no, no, it should not be normally strong, but rather extremely strong. At least, he estimated that he would need to exert his full effort to be a match for it.

This bone was like a child emperor that had supreme authority in his grasp. With a slight move, it could turn the whole world over, and there was practically no one that could restrict it.

It was only a bone, but how did it possess such power? And how had it gained consciousness?

Ling Han stood up, and began walking down the mountain. The bone copied his movements. Its intelligence was becoming higher and higher, and it actually absorbed the Spiritual Qi in the heaven and earth, and grew its own physical body.

Torso, limbs, and head quickly grew out. This was a real body of blood and flesh, though there was no soul. However, its body was enshrouded by an air of Primal Chaos, so how could any normal person be able to distinguish it clearly?

What struck Ling Han speechless was that this guy was actually using him as a blueprint, and the body that it formed was a remarkably similar copy of him! As long as it was mere appearance, it would be too easy, but his aura could not be imitated.

Yet the bone did not mind at all. It did not want to pass itself off as Ling Han. It was only the mentality of a child, wanting to be like you.

What shocked Ling Han was that he did not discover any problem with the bone’s body upon first look, and had to stare at it and examine closely to finally discover that there was an additional bone in this body, which was also its true form.

It could be claimed that this guy’s disguise could be considered perfect!

Under such a disguise, the aura that it released was considerably weaker, seeming to be the early stage of Saint King. This was because it had an additional layer of blood and flesh wrapped around it, which naturally weakened some of its aura. After all, this was blood and flesh that it had grown on its own.

This was good; it would avoid shocking others.

“Yiyaya!” the bone spoke up. It now had its own body of flesh and blood, and could finally speak in the true meaning of the word, which made it very overjoyed. Yet the only phrase it could use to express its own will was still “yiyaya”, and aside from that, it only knew how to imitate words.

Ling Han smiled, and took out some clothes from the Black Tower which he tossed over to it.

The two “people” descended the mountain, and they saw the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others not too long after.

“Yi!” Upon seeing another that looked completely identical next to Ling Han, they were all shocked.

Hadn’t you just gone up to explore the mountain? Why had you brought someone back with you, and one that looked completely like you at that?

“This is Xiao Gu[1].” Ling Han gave the bone a name.

“This, is, Xiao, Gu.” The bone repeated his words, looking dim-witted.

Pfft. Long Xiangyue suddenly spluttered in laughter, and asked, “Senior Brother Ling, why does he copy what you say?”

“Senior, Brother, Ling, why, does...” The bone exuberantly repeated her words.

Was this guy here to be funny?

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others all had strange expressions. Who exactly was this person!?

[1] It literally means “little bone”.
