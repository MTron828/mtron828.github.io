3123 Battling Li Changdan

Ling Han walked into the fog, and continued to search for the formation foundations.

He dug seven feet into the ground, and obtained the third formation foundations.

“I can’t dig anymore.” Ling Han sighed. It wasn’t that he didn’t have enough time, but that the three formation foundations were already very obvious. They had stretched his clothes so much that the latter were nearly bursting at the seams, and thus it was impossible for him to hold a fourth one.

“I’ll have to come back and dig for them later.”

Ling Han was still thinking about it. This formation ought to be very high-level, being capable of forcibly bringing down the cultivation level of Meridian Opening Tier to almost the same level. It would also be very practical in battle.

‘If I can simplify it and set it up at any time, whom would I be afraid of in a battle of the same level?’

He began to look for an exit. He didn’t want Li Changdan to be lucky and walk out first.

“Here… turn three steps to the left.

“Here… take two steps back.”

The fog continued to dissipate in front of him. Standing at a special node, he could clearly see the entire picture.

“Eh?”

Ling Han was astounded. He really couldn’t underestimate Li Changdan. This guy had actually walked more than half of the way. If nothing had changed, he should be able to walk out of the formation in another two hours.

“I’ll fight you!”

Ling Han increased his speed. This wouldn’t allow him to walk in a straight line, and the formation would unknowingly affect his divine sense. Unless his divine sense was extremely powerful, he wouldn’t be able to ignore the effects of the formations.

Right now, he could only follow the rules of the formations obediently.

The distance between the two was rapidly closing, but it was only after half an hour that Ling Han managed to reduce the distance to under 90 meters.

Due to the fog, Li Changdan did not notice Ling Han’s approach. He was still focused on exploring the path ahead.

Hmm?

As he was close enough, Ling Han discovered that there was something faintly glowing under Li Changdan’s neck. With a flash, the fog would be pushed back a little, and then he took the opportunity to take a few steps forward.

Although the speed wasn’t fast, it was stable, and there was no need to take the wrong path.

‘This guy has a treasure that can unravel formations!” Ling Han said. “However, this one should only be able to reduce the power of the formations by a little. Otherwise, he completely could have taken large strides and directly walked out.

Ling Han walked forward, but as soon as he left that special node, Li Changdan’s figure immediately disappeared.

At 60 meters, 30 meters and 15 meters, the distance between the two of them was already getting very close.

Li Changdan suddenly stopped in his tracks. He felt that something was slightly amiss.

He stopped moving, and it looked like he was listening around.

Was anyone approaching?

Impossible. He had a rare treasure that he had obtained from exploring an ancient site. How could he believe that someone could catch up to him now?

Could it be a sniper that the formation had manifested?

This wasn’t impossible. He had explored ancient sites before, and knew that some formations could materialize energy and transform it into a humanoid or ferocious beast form to kill those who entered.

He didn’t dare to be careless, and immediately put up his guard.

The fog billowed. A long time later, a black shadow emerged from the fog and approached him continuously. However, due to the fog, he couldn’t see the other party’s appearance clearly.

The object of energy was fast approaching!

Li Changdan had already channeled his power, ready to unleash an attack of Nine Meridians at any moment.

The fog rose again, and the figure of the person finally became clear.

Disbelief instantly appeared on Li Changdan’s face, and he blurted out, “Ling Han!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Senior Brother Li seems to be very surprised?”

Li Changdan was extremely shrewd, and the shock on his face slowly disappeared. He took a deep breath, and said, “As expected of someone birthed from the Divine Stone, born with special ability!”

He had relied on a rare treasure to reach this place, but Ling Han was actually able to catch up to him. Was there any other reason besides obtaining some sort of ability from the Divine Stone?

Born with special ability?

Ling Han thought for a moment. This could also be counted as so. He possessed the secret code of the entire Genesis World, which equipped him with extremely strong luck and affinity, as well as special comprehension abilities in alchemy and formations.

“Senior Brother Li, shouldn’t we settle the score between us?”

Li Changdan remained calm and even looked surprised. “Junior Brother, what are you talking about?”

“It’s just the two of us, and you still want to pretend?” Ling Han said with a smile. Wasn’t this guy a little too careful?

“Oh!” He nodded. “Senior Brother is worried that I have a recording device on me. If I accidentally record your voice, it will expose your true colors and destroy your perfect image, right?”

“Fine, fine, fine. I can’t be bothered to expose your hypocrisy. Relatively speaking, I’d rather give you a good beating to vent my anger,” Ling Han said. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Junior Brother, you seem to have a lot of misunderstandings about me.” Li Changdan sighed.

“Come and fight!” Ling Han was too lazy to waste his breath. He had always used violence to make others submit.

Xiu, he shot forward like an arrow, and the fog surged. He was like a fairy from the heavens.

Li Changdan was naturally unafraid of the challenge. The corners of his lips curled in a cold smile. Didn’t Ling Han know that he, Li Changdan, was an outstanding talent among the younger generation of the Ancient Dao Sect?

In a battle of the same levels, he was the true invincible one!

He casually struck out with his palm. It appeared to be a light strike, but it actually carried supreme power.

This was the Four Splitting Snowflake Palm, which he had obtained from an ancient site. Its power was slightly inferior to that of the real Four Directional Fists, but because he had only learned one style of the Four Directional Fists, it was definitely not as useful as this palm technique.

With this palm strike, he was going to make Ling Han suffer.

Ling Han did not retreat, and directly took the attack head-on.

Peng!

The two of them clashed, and a force as high as 5,000 kg surged, causing the surrounding fog to rapidly swirl.

Teng, teng, teng, Ling Han took nine consecutive steps back, and Li Changdan also took three consecutive steps back. Both sides took a total of 12 steps back, and both of them instantly disappeared into the fog, making it difficult to see each other’s figures.

Ling Han gave a shake of his hand. Li Changdan really lived up to his reputation. Despite his cultivation level being suppressed to Five Meridians, he actually still had the power to suppress Ling Han.

He couldn’t be underestimated.

However, Ling Han’s fighting spirit flared instead. To constantly trample on trash like Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang really did not give him a sense of accomplishment.

“Junior Brother, you’re really amazing!” Li Changdan said with a smile, but his heart was filled with shock.

Others might not know, but he knew very well that because of the rare treasure hanging around his neck, he could slightly loosen the formations’ suppression on him. Thus, he could move forward slowly but firmly.

On the other hand, the suppression of his cultivation level was weaker than for others.

Others could only be higher by one Meridian, but he was close to two.

He was a prodigy to begin with, and his battle prowess was invincible among those of the same cultivation level. Further, there was the suppression caused by the disparity in power to about two Meridians, so who could be his match?
