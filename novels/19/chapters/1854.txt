Chapter 1855: Think I’m made of clay?

Ling Han broke into a grin, turned to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and asked, “Feng’er, my wife, can you tolerate that?”

“No!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said with loathing. This Liu Yu kept using shifty eyes to peer at her, which made her feel disgusted.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Neither can I!”

He took a step forwards, and walked towards Liu Yu.

“Hey, hey, hey. We can discuss things politely, don’t damage a good relationship!” Zhu Jin hurriedly jumped out to mediate the conflict. He was a businessman, and amiability made you rich. Furthermore, it was indeed Liu Yu who was too unconscientious in this matter. They had already kindly allowed him to have the cultivation chamber, so why did he still have to be so imperious?

Did he really think that the other was made of clay, and could be squeezed and molded as he liked?

“Zhu Jin, get lost!” Liu Yu said aggressively, and disdainfully declared, “Through all the years in my life, this is the first time I have encountered someone that dares to think of making me apologize!”

Ling Han gave a light push, and Zhu Jin was already pushed to the side. He stretched out a hand to grab Liu Yu.

Alchemy City had its laws. Fighting was not forbidden, but murder was definitely not allowed—of course, you could completely commit murder deep in the mountains and forests as long as there were no witnesses.

Ordinarily, as long as the person who had died was not someone too important, and there was no one bringing a lawsuit, Alchemy City couldn’t be bothered to care.

And there was another factor. Unless it was the inferior side that had taken the initiative to provoke the other, elites were strictly forbidden from making a move on those weaker than them.

Because there were too many forces in Alchemy City, if a junior from any clan was beaten, and the seniors ran out in search of revenge, wouldn’t the whole city be in complete chaos? Thus, the matters of juniors would be solved amongst juniors.

And Ling Han knew this, which was why he would move without reservations like this. As long as he did not beat Liu Yu to death, there wouldn’t be any Dividing Soul Tier elites coming out to deal with him.

“How dare you!” Liu Yu sneered. He delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han.

Even though he was arrogant, as if he was a profligate young master, in truth, his natural talent in cultivation was not weak in the slightest. Otherwise, he couldn’t have possibly become one of the heirs of the Martial Arts Branch of the Liu Clan.

...The Liu Clan of Blue Eternity City was a noble clan of alchemy!

Blue Eternity City was a subordinate force under the jurisdiction of Alchemy City. It was similarly filled with alchemists. There were a total of two grand elders in the Liu Clan. One was focused on alchemy, but he was only a One-Star Alchemist. Even so, a One-Star Alchemist was actually already pretty amazing.

The other grand elder specialized in martial arts, and was a Dividing Soul Tier elite. After all, mere alchemy was not enough. They couldn’t ask others for help whenever something came up, after all. Only their own strength was the most reliable.

And thus, there were two branches of the Liu Clan. Those who had high natural talent in martial arts would be focused on cultivating martial arts, and those with natural talent in alchemy would focus on alchemy. For example, Liu Yu did not have any particularly bright talent in alchemy, but his natural talent in martial arts was not too bad. Naturally, he had entered into the Martial Arts Branch.

Because of Liu Yu’s background, when he had come to Alchemy City for leisure this time, he was already targeted by many merchant noble clans wanting to obtain a new supply route of alchemical pills through connections with him.

In the Celestial Realm, the supply of alchemical pills was always less than demand.

Having so many revolving around him, contesting for his favor, Liu Yu’s sense of superiority naturally exploded, and he had also taken the opportunity to make exorbitant demands, and ask for benefits. For example, Blue Eternity City did not have this Time Cultivation Chamber, and he was determined to try it out no matter what.

And now, Ling Han actually dared make a move on him?

Did he really think that just because Liu Yu had come from a clan of alchemists, his battle prowess was weak? ‘You are really much too naive.’

Ling Han did not take it to heart at all. To say nothing of the fact that Liu Yu was not even a king tier, and was a weakling that had just advanced into the second severance, so what if he was a fourth severance peak stage king tier? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Pa, a palm descended, and Liu Yu was picked up by his neck.

“Wu!” Liu Yu’s limbs waved around madly in pain, but it was only pointless effort. In Ling Han’s hands, he was nothing more than an infant.

“Friend! Friend!” Zhu Jin was almost jumping around in his anxiety. If Liu Yu was really wounded, not only would the Zhu Clan be unable to do business with the Liu Clan, if the Liu Clan announced and demanded that other alchemists not do business with them, either, then the Zhu Clan would be in big trouble.

But he could not get near Ling Han at all. Under the pressure of his aura, he could only pace back and forth nine meters away.

Only now did he know just how powerful Ling Han was. He couldn’t help but sigh involuntarily in his heart. ‘Liu Yu, why did you have to trifle with him for no reason like this? He had already allowed you to have the cultivation chamber, and you still insisted on being pompous, so who would be beaten if not you?’

But he couldn’t just stand and watch, either—though he also quite disliked Liu Yu, wanting nothing more than for the latter to be beaten, it should not be done in front of his eyes at least.

He continuously mediated from the sidelines, talking about Liu Yu’s background, and hoping that he could convince Ling Han not to be reckless.

How could Ling Han possibly give him any regard? He only set his eyes on Liu Yu, and said, “With such a smelly mouth, did you grow up from eating mud?” The large black dog was not here, and he was not very creative, so he could only pick up a rock from the ground, crush it, then stuff the dirt into Liu Yu’s mouth.

“Wu!” Liu Yu wanted to spit it out, but could not do as he wished at all, and could only shake his head in pain.

Actually, with his cultivation level, eating rocks was not a big deal. The problem was that this was too humiliating.

Some have ended their cultivation, and just happened to walk out. When they saw this scene, they involuntarily burst into laughter.

Liu Yu’s face instantly flushed bright red, and he felt as if those gazes from the spectators were like blades that pierced painfully into him.

He had never, ever, been, so, humiliated!

He stared at Ling Han furiously. He vowed that he would kill this person, definitely!

“Heh, you still haven’t learnt your lesson?” Ling Han asked coldly. Pa, he delivered a slap over.

Pu!

The rocks in Liu Yu’s mouth instantly spewed out. Not only that, there were also a few broken teeth mixed in. One side of his face heavily swelled up, which showed how strong the force of this slap was.

This naturally was because Ling Han had not used his full strength. Otherwise, Liu Yu’s form and spirit would have long since been obliterated.

Peng!

Ling Han pressed down again, and Liu Yu’s whole head sunk deeply into the tiles. Thankfully, Severing Mundane Tier had too much time and Origin Power, so they could temper their physique whilst they cultivated, so their physique was strong enough. Otherwise, even if Liu Yu didn’t die from this blow, he would be half-dead.

But even so, he was still seeing stars, and didn’t even remember who he was anymore.

His arms were drooping weakly, while his behind was raised high. This position was a little ambiguous.

Ling Han couldn’t help but think of the large black dog. If the large black dog was here, he would probably do that, right?

He revealed a demon-like grin, and said, “Feng’er, my wife, leave for a while.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded, and entered into the Black Tower.

Meanwhile, Ling Han drew out a bamboo pole. This was a Saintly item—the Nine Segment Purple Bamboo—and was astonishingly tough. Each segment would only grow in 100,000,000 years, and it was extremely valuable. He snickered, and with a pu, he stabbed the bamboo pole into Liu Yu’s behind.

“Ah...” Even if Liu Yu’s senses were already a little fuzzy at this point, the pain of having his a*s stabbed still forced him back to consciousness. He tried his best to shake his behind, wanting to expel the strange object, but how could it possibly go the way he wanted?

Zhu Jin, meanwhile, was already completely dumbfounded. It was over, the young master of the Liu Clan actually had his a*s stabbed under his escort. He would not be able to absolve himself of his responsibility, either.

He wanted to cry, but had no tears.

Though Ling Han’s current action had gone a little too far, could he really be blamed? If he was being honest, and if it was himself in the former’s place, would he be even more furious?

Why should Ling Han just take it lying down? He was not a Saint!

“In the future, be a good man. There are many people in this world that have better strength and background than you. You should feel fortunate that this is Alchemy City. Otherwise, with my temper, I would have long since killed you!” Ling Han patted the bamboo pole, and it shook under his hand, causing Liu Yu’s screams of pain to lift a few notes higher.
