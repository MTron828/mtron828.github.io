3065 Illegitimate Son?

Even Ling Han was slightly surprised. This woman could actually act so shamelessly?

Was it really necessary to stoop so low in order to ride on a Celestial King’s coattail?

However, he didn’t lose his temper, and he simply observed the situation quietly. If Wang Quanhe showed indecisiveness, and if he showed this kind of woman undeserved sympathy, then Ling Han wouldn’t have the time nor effort to give this descendant much help. He would simply help him get to the Ninth Heaven before letting him be.

“Li Jingchu!!” the members of the Li Clan roared. They were filled with fury.

They could understand the fact that she wanted to live. However, she couldn’t push all the blame onto them!

“Kill them, Quanhe! Kill them!” Li Jingchu shouted. A sinister expression flashed across her pretty face, ruining her beauty. There was savageness on her face as she yelled, “Kill them all, and then I’ll be able to leave with you. We can live together and care for each other forever!”

She put on a pitiful expression, and continued, “Quanhe, didn’t you always want to marry me? I’ll accept your proposal today!

Wang Quanhe remained silent. After a while, he shook his head, and said, “Do you take me for a three-year-old child? Or perhaps you think I’m still the foolish youth from three years ago?”

He paused for a moment before spitting with soaring killing intent, “I’ve come here to exact revenge today! Those who have the blood of my Wang Clan on their hands… don’t even think of escaping! Li Jingchu, as one of the main culprits, even dying 100 times is not enough to repent for your sins!”

Li Jingchu’s imposing aura instantly deflated like a balloon. She didn’t dare to challenge the furious Wang Quanhe, and she could only put on an even more pitiful expression as she said, “Wang Quanhe, just forgive me once, okay? I’ll definitely serve you well in the future.”

“Revolting!” Wang Quanhe said coldly.

Shua, shua, shua!

With a few swings of his blade, Li Bing was immediately cut into a dozen pieces.

Those at the Eternal River Tier had powerful life forces, so Li Bing didn’t die right away even though he had been reduced to such a miserable state. The severed pieces of his body continued to squirm, and it was as if they were worms wriggling on the ground.

This was a bloody and terrifying scene.

Wang Quanhe lashed out again, grabbing another member of the Li Clan, and asking in a baleful voice, “How many members of the Wang Clan did you kill?”

The person in his hand was so terrified that he directly suffered a mental breakdown, with his eyes rolling into his head and a warm liquid running down his legs.

“I won’t grant you such an easy death!” Wang Quanhe sneered as he restricted the person’s cultivation and tossed them aside.

“Run!” the clan leader of the Li Clan shouted. “Everyone, go in different directions! Even though this ungrateful brat is extremely powerful, there’s only one of him, after all. He won’t be able to catch us all.”

The members of the Li Clan immediately started to flee in different directions. However, they quickly discovered that they couldn’t run out of this hall no matter what. Meanwhile, those outside the hall couldn’t run outside the courtyard, and those outside the courtyard couldn’t run out of the town.

This… What in the world was going on? Was this also that ungrateful brat Wang Quanhe’s doing?

Wang Quanhe turned to Prince Ma Xuan and clasped his hands in respect, saying, “Thank you for the help, Lord.”

Indeed, he wasn’t powerful enough to unleash such an ability yet. However, Celestial Kings could use such abilities with ease.

Prince Ma Xuan nodded with a smile, and said, “It’s no trouble at all.”

They were done for, they were truly done for… Even a Celestial King had become involved, so not even a dog from the Li Clan would be able to make it out of this place alive today. Otherwise, that would be a great humiliation for the Celestial King involved.

Thus, the Li Clan was definitely beyond saving. They were as dead as could be.

Wang Quanhe resolutely lashed out, killing anyone who had participated in the battle three years ago. He would cut them into as many pieces as the number of people they had killed. This was genuinely cruel and merciless.

He started killing the more unimportant members of the Li Clan first, and it was only natural that he would leave the clan leader and Li Jingchu for the last. Only this way could he maximize the elation he felt from exacting revenge.

Ling Han shook his head slightly upon seeing this.

He had never experienced the excruciating pain of having his clan massacred before. Even though the Wang Clan was descended from his bloodline, they were already many generations down, and he had never met them before, either. Thus, even though he felt furious, he couldn’t feel anywhere near as wrathful as Wang Quanhe.

To Ling Han, these people were his descendants in name only. To Wang Quanhe, however, these people were his family who he lived with and cared about, so how could their feelings be compared?

Ling Han could understand Wang Quanhe’s thirst for revenge. However, he still felt like Wang Quanhe was taking things a little too far.

Perhaps there had always been a beast hidden in this young man’s heart, and following the destruction of the Wang Clan, this beast was finally set free and allowed to engulf Wang Quanhe’s true nature. Or perhaps this was his nature to begin with.

Ling Han decided that he had to give his descendent a few lessons. Otherwise, this brat would eventually go mad one day.

Inside the hall, all of the members of the Li Clan had already collapsed to the ground, helpless and in despair. Faced with such a situation, what else could they do but wait for death?

Only Li Jingchu remained stubborn and unwilling to give up. She stood there and spoke by herself, recounting all of her encounters and interactions with Wang Quanhe, attempting to sway him.

Weng! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A powerful aura suddenly crashed over, directly shattering the defensive barrier that Prince Ma Xuan had erected.

Immediately afterward, a person abruptly appeared in the hall.

However, one’s surprise would immediately turn into understanding when they saw the two ribbons of iridescent light around his body. It was only natural that he could enter with such ease.

Because he was a Second Heaven Celestial King.

The Celestial King clasped his hands, and greeted, “Brother Ma!”

Prince Ma Xuan also looked over. He furrowed his brows slightly, and asked in an uncertain voice, “Brother Xu? The Red Flame Sect’s sect leader, Xu Fei?”

“That’s right,” the Second Heaven Celestial King said with a loud laugh.

Prince Ma Xuan’s heart skipped a beat. However, his expression remained calm as he asked, “For what purpose has Brother Xu come?”

“Come on, Brother Ma, this is quite cold of you,” Xu Fei said with a shake of his head. “What did you just do to an elder from my sect? Did you forget already?”

A glimmer of hope appeared in the eyes of the collapsed members of the Li Clan. In fact, even Li Jingchu shut her mouth and stopped speaking.

The situation… was potentially changing.

“Oh, won’t you look at my terrible memory,” Prince Ma Xuan said with a chuckle. “So that’s what Brother Xu has come for. However, I don’t recall ever wounding an elder from your esteemed sect?”

“Indeed,” Xu Fei replied with a nod. “However, Elder Luo’s grandson died a miserable death because of this. As the sect leader of the Red Flame Sect, it naturally wouldn’t make sense for me to ignore this. Brother Ma, please hand the culprit over. I’ll invite you over for a drink in a few days, and we can chat to our heart’s content then.”

Prince Ma Xuan spread his hands, and said, “Culprit? What culprit? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Him! It’s him!” The members of the Li Clan surprisingly started to roar. They all pointed at Wang Quanhe. This was their only sliver of hope right now, so they were willing to ignore even the threat from Prince Ma Xuan.

Li Jingchu took things even further, sobbing, “Lord Celestial King, I just got married to Luo Guang, yet after laying eyes on my beauty, this depraved beast actually dared to unleash violence on my wedding day. Please deliver justice, Lord Celestial King!”

Tears streamed down her face, and she appeared as delicate and pitiable as could be.

However, would Xu Fei be moved because of this? Thinking so would be looking down on Celestial Kings.

Meanwhile, Prince Ma Xuan frowned at what he saw. He hadn’t imagined that these people would be able to muster such courage when granted a sliver of hope. They actually dared to utter such words before him.

There was a faint smile on Xu Fei’s face as he quietly looked at Prince Ma Xuan.

Prince Ma Xuan contemplated things for a moment before saying, “This young man is of great importance, so it’s best that Brother Xu stays out of this.”

“Oh? Perhaps he’s Brother Ma’s illegitimate son then?” Xu Fei chuckled.
