Chapter 2428: Fate

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered, and directly challenged all four damaged weapons.

This naturally was not because he was too arrogant, but rather that he was confident. As long as these four damaged weapons did not unleash their strongest blows, he was completely capable of matching their combined forces.

Weng, weng, weng.?The other three weapons also revived respectively. The damaged sword, saber, and halberd all floated in the air, forming a line of attack with the damaged spear as they unleashed an offensive on Ling Han.

The joined forces of these four weapons would definitely surpass a simple layering of their might. Just think of the past: when the four Celestial Tools were still in their prime, what Celestial King was capable of matching them? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

How had this place been destroyed? Could it have been the move of a Heavenly Venerate?

Logically, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly appear on the Celestial Path. Then could it be that this was originally a part of the Celestial Realm, and it was only later that it was split from the former, and swallowed by the Celestial Path? Or… the Celestial Path itself was within the Celestial Realm, and there had been no such thing as opening or closing before?

These thoughts flashed through Ling Han’s mind. At present, he did not have the time to think too much, and could only release battle cries as he battled intensely with the four Celestial Tools.

If the Divine Demon Sword was taken into account as well, there were actually five Celestial Tools here, which was extremely shocking.

Ling Han tried his best. He did not use the power of the Dimension Scroll, because he felt that his own power was enough to suppress these four Celestial Tools.

Battle, battle, battle!

He was fighting to his heart’s content. The defense of his opponents far surpassed his, and would not be wounded by him at all, so he could attack without any reservations at all. This was a very good feeling.

Ling Han was primarily using Body Arts to suppress them and various Regulations as replenishment. The strength of his battle prowess was chilling.

But after only 1,000 moves, the four Celestial Tools ceased attacking at the same time. The seals of light dimmed.?Pa, pa, pa,?they dropped onto the ground, and this time, they were no longer stabbed slantingly into the ground, but were rather just lying there, as if they had lost all their life.

Weng, an intent suddenly entered into Ling Han’s mind, and took the form of a human figure.

Ling Han was instantly shocked. This was the female Celestial King that he had seen in the flow of time!

“Destined one, the fact that you can see me, and hear these words from me, means that not only do you have outstanding talent, you have also obtained Devouring Metal,” the female Celestial King said. This was only a sliver of intent of hers, so she was naturally communicating via divine sense as well. “It is possible for you to become a Heavenly Venerable Tier, and these four weapons that I have once used can also be fused by the Devouring Metal, helping it to advance to another stronger level.”

“Senior, may I ask your name?” Ling Han asked.

Yet the female Celestial King did not answer, and continued, “On the surface, the Celestial Realm is peaceful and calm, but in truth, there is danger in all corners. There are terrifying enemies spying on us, and if you can become a Heavenly Venerate, I hope that you can plow the halls and sweep the pavilions, and resolve the foreign aggressions threatening the Celestial Realm once and for all.

“Additionally… my son has just been born, and I was killed. Being unable to watch him grow into a man is truly a regret. If you have the chance to see my son, help me pass on a message. Tell him that I miss him very much.

“My son’s name is Yuan Sheng, and the person who has killed me… bears the title Jiuwu!”

When these words fell, the female Celestial King’s figure disappeared with a tremor. This was only a thought that she had left behind in the Celestial Tools that had not dispersed. Now that her will had been passed on, she was naturally gone from sight.

Yet Ling Han was stunned into speechlessness.

‘It can’t be that this female Celestial King is the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s mother, right?’

It was extremely possible. No matter what, the descendant of a Celestial King should be extremely awesome, especially when this female Celestial King was already so powerful herself. Then, among the more famous Yuan Shengs that appeared after, there seemed to be only a single Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, right?

Furthermore, if that was not the case, when Ling Han had almost crossed the ages, and managed to communicate with this female Celestial King, why had the heaven and earth forcefully interrupted them?

Because this implicated a Heavenly Venerate, an existence that surpassed Regulations. Once any changes were made to the path of maturity of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, a revolutionary change would take place in history. With such a powerful barrage of time, the whole realm could even collapse.

Hence, the heaven and earth had to stop them.

Moreover, the mother of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had been killed by Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate?

Could it be that that old guy had predicted that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable would affect his future plans, and had thus wanted to get rid of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable in advance, even before his birth? But even if he was a Heavenly Venerate, he was unable to fully predict every scene in the future. Thus, he had killed the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s mother, yet the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had already been born.

As expected, first, there was the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le sniping the elites of the Foreign Realm, and after came the self-sacrifice of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, which delayed the Foreign Realm for another eight epochs, proving that the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had not erred by making a move. He had just been slightly too late.

“This old bastard!” Ling Han gritted his teeth in hatred.

There were really quite a number of despicable deeds that Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate had done before. Ling Han himself had been hunted down by him before, and it was two times at that! Old grudges and new hatred added together caused Ling Han to grit his teeth involuntarily.

“Please don’t worry, Senior. You are considered my grandmaster as?well1. With yours and Master’s hatred, added with my own, we have a three-generation blood feud with the old bastard Jiuwu. I will definitely kill this villain with my own hands!” Ling Han murmured.

This was not just a word of comfort for the female Celestial King, but was also a show of confidence. He would definitely surpass the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and kill this old bastard.

He stretched out his hand in a grab, and the four Celestial Tools all fell into his hand. The intent of the Celestial King had dispersed, and these four weapons were presently only Celestial Tools. They could no longer be revived, and were damaged at that.

There was no rush to refine them. Ling Han took another step forwards, and arrived in front of the Celestial Tree.

He stretched out a hand, and grabbed out at that celestial fruit.

Zi!

The Celestial Tree swayed lightly, and the lightning immediately became as dense as a spider’s web, and then turned into a bolt of lightning that struck out at him.

Ling Han hurriedly parried this blow with a fist.?Zi, a feeling of electrocution immediately flowed through his body, causing his whole body to tremble. His bones had almost collapsed, even.

What a strong attack!

Ling Han was slightly surprised. Very rarely would a Celestial Tree be attack-focused as they all usually tended to run quickly. However, this Celestial Tree was different. It did not flee, and was extremely ferocious.

‘Do you think I’m scared of you?’

Ling Han stretched out his hand again, his Body Art unleashed to the extreme, a boundless aura spreading out from him.

The Celestial Tree trembled, and?pa, that celestial fruit actually fell down.

‘This…!’

Ling Han was speechless. This Celestial Tree was completely a paper tiger. He had only just slightly revealed his strength, and it cowered, completely showing what a coward was like.

However, since the celestial fruit had already been bestowed, Ling Han refrained from being too hard on it, either. He stowed the celestial fruit away, and did not further make things difficult for this Celestial Tree.

Now that this had touched his hand, it could only be ingested by him alone, or could be concocted into an alchemical pill.

Using a naturally complete Celestial Seed to concoct an alchemical pill?

That was too wasteful. Moreover, this Celestial Tree had only borne one fruit, and was also closer to the heart of the Celestial Path. Clearly, this celestial fruit was also more valuable.

Ling Han did not hesitate, and swallowed it directly.

“Is it delicious?” Hu Niu came over, practically drooling.

She did not feel jealous that Ling Han had obtained an even better Celestial Seed, but only felt that it was a pity that she was unable to taste this kind of delicacy.

“Not really.” Ling Han gritted his teeth, and multiple flashes of lightning were wreaking havoc in his mouth presently, crackling and popping loudly.

Hu Niu was instantly amused, and laughed out loudly.

She was a glutton, but there was lightning melded into a fruit. Just thinking about it, the taste could not possibly be anything close to delicious.

And the people around were all looking at Ling Han enviously. Not only had this guy obtained a complete Celestial Seed, four damaged Celestial Tools had even entered his pockets!

Even though these Celestial Tools were damaged, they could be returned to the furnace and reforged, and any one of them could unleash their divine might once again.
