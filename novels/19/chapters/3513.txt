Chapter 3514: Void Beast Skin

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han brought the Formation Scroll back. This time, he had come out to acknowledge a “nephew”, which made him feel an indescribable pleasure.

-Someone as strong as a True Lord of Spirit Transformation, the ruler of a nation, and now in terms of seniority, he was his nephew. Just the thought of it made him feel a little excited.

He naturally would not tell anyone about this matter. It was fine as long as he was secretly pleased with himself. Furthermore, even if he told others, they may not believe him either.

After returning to the Foreign Affairs Department, Ling Han made some preparations, then began to study this formations treasured book.

He believed that the formation patterns on it were Celestial Path-level, and for the current level of his Spiritual Power, the requirements were too high, which was why he had exhausted all his energy when he was exploring its secrets.

On the other hand, Celestial Path elites had a very distinct trait, and that was their Spiritual Power was very strong.

This fact could be proven from Gongsun Liang’s body. Spiritual Power could casually grab a rock that weighed over 50,000 kilograms; this was too terrifying.

Was Gongsun Liang a Grandmaster of Spiritual Power?

Ling Han refused to believe this even if it killed him.

Hence, after leaping over the Celestial Gate, a cultivator’s Spiritual Power would definitely improve by leaps and bounds. Then, going by the same logic, if one wanted to become a Celestial level Formation Master, how high would the requirements for Spiritual Power be?

Even if Ling Han guarded his divine sense closely, it was still useless. For him, Celestial level formation patterns were too high in level. The moment he studied it, it would completely exhaust his energy.

Ling Han shook his head, and could only reluctantly give up.

He was a little depressed. This was really a mountain of treasure that he could

not excavate.

“Yi?”

He discovered that not all the formation patterns were recorded on this beast hide. There was also a small section of writing that explained the origins of this beast hide.

“This is the hide of a Void Beast, which has been refined by a Grandmaster of Formation Arts.” Ling Han read, “The Void Beast is a Divine Beast of the heaven and earth. It naturally can travel through space, and is one of the most peculiar Divine Beasts in the world.”

“When one wraps the hide of a Void Beast around his body, he would feel as if he is standing in the Void, and difficult to discover.

“Using this to record formation patterns can not be corroded by time, and last as long as trillions of years.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly. As it turned out, this beast hide itself was also a precious treasure.

He wrapped the beast hide around himself, and instantly felt a mysterious power take effect on him, as if it had fused into another space.

“Yi?”

“Ah?”

Ling Han suddenly saw a child. With a single glance, he could confirm that this was one of the seven Calabash Brothers. However, this was something that he had never seen before.

Sixth Baby!

He actually saw the invisible Sixth Baby?

“Father, how did you manage to escape into the Void?” Sixth Baby said as she bit her finger. She then clapped her hands, and said, “I know. You’re wearing a Void Beast hide, so you’re in the same space as me. Thus, you’ll naturally be able to see me.”

F***, so smart. This would make him feel very guilty.

Ling Han sighed. It was as if there was nothing that the seven children didn’t understand. It was just that their memories seemed to have been locked, and would only be unlocked when they encountered a specific situation.

Just like how Sixth Baby wouldn’t take the initiative to say that the Void Beast hide could allow one to hide oneself, but after seeing this effect, she would immediately come to a realization.

They were clearly seven toddlers, so how did they know so much?

Could it be that they were the reincarnations of great elites?

Ling Han smiled. He could finally see how Sixth Baby looked like.

Hold on, could he pass through a wall?

Ling Han walked to the side of a wall, then lightly crashed into it. In the end… he did not succeed.

“Hahaha.” Sixth Baby laughed loudly, “Father, you are only wearing the Void Beast hide, and have not fused with this beast hide, so it is impossible for you to physically pass through barriers.”

Sigh, so that was the case.

Ling Han was extremely disappointed. If he could also casually pass through the restrictions and thick walls like Sixth Baby, that would be great.

Though it was not perfect, it still could not be denied that the Void Beast’s hide was strong, and could have endless amazing effects.

“This beast hide, along with that broken stone tablet, should not be too bad.” Ling Han’s heart throbbed wildly. That broken stone tablet that was suspected to be a broken piece of a tombstone was something that even Brother Monkey said was impressive, so he kept wanting to test out its might.

“Who should I look for?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

On second thought, he immediately had a candidate.

Hong Tianbu.

He did as he said. At night, Ling Han walked quietly, but the mischievous Sixth Baby caught up with him. When she found out that her father was possibly going to do something bad, how could the little girl not join in on the excitement?

Forget it. This little girl was born with an invisibility effect. As long as the other person was not a Celestial Path elite, it would be impossible for them to discover her. She was safe.

The adult and child took advantage of the night to travel. When they arrived outside the Hong Residence, Ling Han took out the Void Beast hide and draped it over his body, instantly disappearing into the Void.

He climbed over the wall and entered the room in a single breath.

The Hong Residence was huge, and Grand Tutor Hong didn’t just have two grandsons, Hong Tianbu and Hong Tianliang. There was a whole bunch of them, and added with some of his collateral relatives, the Hong Clan’s population was actually very large. Merely by themselves, they were completely capable of establishing a sect.

Ling Han searched for a long time, and finally found Hong Tianbu’s room.

It was close to dawn, but Hong Tianbu still hadn’t slept yet. He was currently conversing with Grand Tutor Hong.

“… That despicable brat’s power is already established, so he’s not easily dealt with! Damn it, we didn’t eliminate him as soon as possible before he sprouted.” Grand Tutor Hong’s voice rang out.

■Old b@stard, you’ve targeted me time and time again, yet you’re still unwilling to give up?’

Ling Han humphed upon hearing this. He had come here to exact revenge. He was going to beat Hong Tianbu, as well as Grand Tutor Hong.

Hong Tianbu’s voice was also heard, “There is no need to worry about that despicable brat. Ultimately, his cultivation level is still too low, so he would not be able to do much. Mainly, it is Chen Fengyan. His strength is unfathomable. Though everyone estimates that he is in the Core Formation Tier, in my opinion, it is possible that there is more than that.”

“Bu’er, are you sure?” Grand Tutor Hong appeared to be a little flustered. What they were planning, could possibly cause them to lose their heads.

Hong Tianbu nodded and said, “I fused with the eye of a Primordial Beast, and I can see a lot of things that ordinary people can’t. However, when I saw Chen Fengyan, the fusion wasn’t perfect enough, so I can’t confirm it. I only have this feeling.”

Grand Tutor Hong couldn’t help but be speechless. The stronger Chen Fengyan was, the harder it would be to realize their scheme.

“Bu’er, no, we should continue to keep a low profile at this time,” he advised. Hong Tianbu said, “I’ve already contacted the people in the prison. There s a Spirit Transformation True Lord who intends to take me as disciple. Although Chen Fengyan is powerful, he’s clearly no match for a Spirit Transformation True Lord.”

“Really?” Grand Tutor Hong was excited again.

Hong Tianbu nodded, “In a few years, the great elites in the prison will all appear. In this period, I will use my full effort to increase my cultivation level. At that time, the winds and clouds will change, and whoever rises and falls will be up to me, Hong Tianbu!”

“Haha!” Grand Tutor Hong also laughed loudly, “Bu’er, the future of our Hong Clan will all fall on your shoulders.”

“Grandfather, don’t worry. The Hong Clan will definitely flourish in my hands, and become a powerful clan. In fact, we’ll even enter the galaxy in the future, and stand on equal footing with the top-notch noble clans,” Hong Tianbu said passionately.

Grand Tutor Hong was also incredibly excited by these illusions, as if this scene was right in front of his eyes.

“Who goes there!” Hong Tianbu suddenly shouted loudly, and suddenly broke out of the window..
