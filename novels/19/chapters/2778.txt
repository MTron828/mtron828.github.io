2779 Boss Yuan

Ling Han calmly walked away after teaching the seven people a lesson. They weren’t worth any more of his time.

In any case, it would be best if these people learned from their mistakes and changed their ways. If they still persisted, however, and if they still insisted on harassing him, he would kill them without any hesitation.

Ling Han returned inside the barrier, where he continued to cultivate.

There were a total of eight Heavenly Venerable Seals in his mind, and circulating together, they could aid him in communicating with heaven and earth. This would allow him to extract a large amount of fundamental power, thereby helping him raise his cultivation.

Ling Han reached some sort of understanding; it was likely that he could never cultivate the First Tier to the pinnacle level. This was because no such pinnacle existed. Each cell in the body could be viewed as an individual dimension that could continue to grow stronger and stronger. There was neither any limit nor end.

In other words, reaching the so-called pinnacle was reaching the limit of power of a given dimension. In that case, how many years would it take to reach the absolute pinnacle?

“If I want to, I can most likely advance to the Second Tier at any time I please,” Ling Han said to himself. He was in a strange state right now. He could already manipulate Void Particle Energy since long ago, and he was more so able to manipulate the Power of Dimensions at this moment. Thus, he could already be regarded as a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“However, I feel like I still haven’t reached a level of Great Accomplishment in the First Tier. Many of my Powers of Dimensions are extremely fragile, and they still need to be nurtured for a long period of time. Otherwise, once Void Particle Energy enters my body, these cells might shatter and collapse due to their inability to host this power. That will be a huge loss.

“So, I need to take things step by step.”

Ling Han told himself to calm down and be patient. Right now, his cultivation mainly relied on his own body, where the dimensions inside him combined together to form a whole. No one could help him.

Several days later, he suddenly received a letter challenging him to battle.

This challenge had been issued by a person called Yuan Yinglong, inviting him to a battle on Four Seas Mountain outside the city three days later.

‘This is most likely Boss Yuan, right?’ Ling Han thought with a shake of his head. Unexpectedly, the seven people still failed to learn their lesson.

‘So be it, a battle then.’

Ling Han accepted this challenge. He believed that no one in the second level or even third level could rival him. Of course, it was also possible that there was someone as freakish as him, being able to rival those at the Second or Third Tier while still at the First Tier.

No, they couldn’t possibly rival those at the Third Tier!

Ling Han was filled with confidence. He had spent so long and experienced so many failures, and he had only succeeded after almost succumbing to death. He refused to believe that this could be replicated.

Three days later, he was accompanied to Four Seas Mountain by the Empress.

“Ling Han, a battle on the mountain!” a clear voice called out from the mountain peak.

Ling Han nodded to the Empress and the others before taking a single stride, which immediately brought him to the top of the mountain.

What he saw was a young man standing there, tall and solid in stature, with black hair billowing and determination etched on his face. There was an indescribable air of exuberance and triumph about him.

“Let me first apologize for my good-for-nothing underlings,” the man said, even bowing in apology.

Ling Han was slightly astonished by this. He nodded, and said, “I’ve already taught them a lesson.”

“However, as their boss, I naturally can’t remain calm after seeing them being bullied. Thus, I still have to challenge Brother Ling to a battle,” Yuan Yinglong said. He clasped his hands, and continued, “If you can’t block my fists, then you’ll have to suffer a beating.”

Ling Han laughed, and replied, “Then show me what you’ve got.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Peng!

With a soft roar, Yuan Yinglong immediately charged at Ling Han.

He threw a punch, drawing on the unique power of heaven and earth. Combined with his own strength, this formed the most powerful attack in the Genesis World. Even Divine Metal would be crushed into smithereens by this attack.

Ling Han also replied with a punch.

Peng, peng, peng!

The two of them became locked in a ferocious battle.

“Sure enough, your strength is quite extraordinary!” Yuan Yinglong said loudly. His voice boomed with confidence as he continued, “But I’m even more powerful!”

His punches became even more rapid.

Ling Han casually blocked these strikes. This Yuan Yinglong was indeed very powerful, with his battle prowess definitely exceeding that of ordinary First Tier Heavenly Venerates. However, he was still far inferior to Ling Han. If Ling Han wanted to, he could obliterate this person with a single punch.

However, he felt like Yuan Yinglong was a fairly decent person since he understood the need to apologize and the need to stand up for his underlings. This raised Ling Han’s opinion of him.

After throwing several hundred punches and yet still failing to capture Ling Han, Yuan Yinglong resolutely summoned a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and channeled a Heavenly Venerate Technique. A dazzling saber projection slashed forth.

This was a Heavenly Venerate Technique, so its might was naturally great.

Ling Han also drew on some more power, maintaining an equal footing with his opponent.

Yuan Yinglong’s expression instantly changed. Even though they had been evenly matched just then, Yuan Yinglong had only regarded this as Ling Han being as powerful as himself.

Now, however, Yuan Yinglong had already summoned a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and even unleashed a Heavenly Venerate Technique! Just how much had his battle prowess increased?

Yet, without summoning any weapon and without using any powerful technique, Ling Han was still able to rival him with ease… That being the case, just how powerful would he be if he unleashed his full strength?

Yuan Yinglong knew that he had already lost, yet he was unwilling to yield before finding out Ling Han’s true power. Thus, he let out a roar, with several symbols materializing on his chest.

‘Huh? These are Heavenly Venerable Seals.’

Even though they were fuzzy, Ling Han was still able to recognize them as these were the first few Heavenly Venerable Seals that he had mastered—they had been provided by the Divine Demon Sword.

These seven Heavenly Venerable Seals were also the most widely known ones as they would be revealed once a Devouring Metal underwent its final transformation. Thus, they weren’t difficult for Heavenly Venerates to obtain.

Heavenly Venerable Seals, Heavenly Venerate Tool, and Heavenly Venerate Technique. Just how powerful was the combination of these three? So terrifying that it could rival the Second Tier!

Yet, Ling Han remained calm and composed as he blocked this attack, not appearing strained in the least.

“I’ve lost,” Yuan Yinglong said, a complicated expression on his face as he voluntarily stopped his attacks. He was a prodigy, and back in his own dimension, he was more so the most prodigious talent of all time. After arriving here, however, even though he was still able to make a name for himself, he was no longer worthy of the title of “strongest.”

Ling Han nodded and waved his hand in acknowledgment. He then turned around to leave.

“Wait,” Yuan Yinglong said, taking a step forward.

Ling Han turned around, smiling, and asking, “What’s wrong? You want another battle?”

Yuan Yinglong hurriedly shook his head, and replied, “No, no, no, I simply want to invite Brother Ling to some place.”

Ling Han wore a strange expression, remaining silent as he looked at Yuan Yinglong and waited for him to continue.

Yuan Yinglong faltered for a moment before eventually coming to his senses. “Rest assured, I’m definitely not trying to trick Brother Ling into going somewhere for ulterior purposes!”

...

He paused for a moment before saying, “I want to invite Brother Ling to explore a mystery realm together.”

“Oh?” Ling Han was slightly surprised. Yuan Yinglong was already a Heavenly Venerate, so why did he still want to go to a mystery realm? Perhaps there actually existed treasures that could speed up the cultivation of Heavenly Venerates or even help them advance?

No, no such thing existed!

Heavenly Venerates suffered jealousy from heaven and earth, so how could heaven and earth possibly nurture such treasures for them?

“Heavenly Venerable Seals!” Yuan Yinglong said with a serious expression.

Ling Han found this even stranger. Couldn’t Heavenly Venerable Seals only be cultivated by oneself?

“There are two ways to nurture Heavenly Venerable Seals. The first is through elites comprehending heaven and earth, and thus forming them through their grand wisdom. The second is through a special environment,” Yuan Yinglong explained. “It’s extremely difficult to form such a special environment. Firstly, it must be free from the influence of heaven and earth.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. Heavenly Venerates suffered jealousy from heaven and earth, and this was the case even in the transcendent dimension.

“This is a place where the two dimensions meet, which renders it free from both the influence of Hysteria and the influence of the Flaming Frost Realm. As such, it satisfies the first condition,” Yuan Yinglong said.
