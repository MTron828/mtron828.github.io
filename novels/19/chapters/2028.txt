Chapter 2029: All Killed

Following Lan Tianyang’s command for more sacrifices, 100 or so islanders were immediately killed. The surroundings became a sea of blood.

The blood sacrifice resumed, and Che Yuanhua’s and Lan Tianyang’s battle prowess instantly soared again. They finally managed to suppress Xiao Gu.

“Earth Locking Technique!” they roared in unison. Wisps of black air flowed from their fingertips, transforming into lengths of thread that wrapped around Xiao Gu, and preventing him from moving freely.

It didn’t matter that they couldn’t kill him. As long as they could capture him, they could take him away and bring him before more powerful elites. At that time, they would be able to thoroughly exterminate this great threat.

Xiao Gu fought and struggled, yet he was unable to break free.

“There’s also this brat!” Lan Tianyang said as he turned around. He glared at Ling Han.

They had to capture Ling Han and bring him back to their sect as well. After all, he possessed a Source Power of heaven and earth, and this was something that their sect master had specifically asked them to obtain.

“I’ll capture him!” Che Yuanhua said as he strode toward Ling Han.

He was a Ninth Lotus elite, which was equivalent to being an Ascending Origin Tier elite. With a single thought, he could kill Ling Han several times over.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I suggest you look after yourselves first!”

‘Hmm?’

Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang turned around to look at Xiao Gu, only to see a wisp of light shining within him. This light then transformed into a dazzling symbol.

Whoosh!

The symbol flew out from Xiao Gu’s body, instantly obliterating the black threads around him with an overwhelming force.

Xiao Gu regained his freedom.

“Yiyaya!” He was enraged, and he launched a flurry of vicious attacks at Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang again. This time, he more so retrieved a bone from his body.

This bone was his true body, and there was a Celestial King Tier symbol dazzling atop it.

This bone could be viewed as a Celestial Tool, one which possessed a devastating might. With a single attack, it could shatter heaven and earth.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Rumble...

One after another, numerous celestial bodies started to rain down from the sky. These were meteors that were as large as mountains.

How could Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang block this?

They weren’t struck, yet just the shock waves emitted by these meteors caused them to cough blood as they retreated in disarray. They couldn’t block this power at all.

Xiao Gu was unleashing a divine might, and this was a completely unstoppable force.

“Retreat! Hurry up and retreat!” Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang immediately turned around to retreat without regard for anything else. Right now, they were facing the full might of a Celestial Tool. How could they hope to rival it?

However, they were still too slow. Xiao Gu wielded that bone, which was dazzling with celestial light.

Boom!

In just a short moment, one of Che Yuanhua’s arms was severed by the celestial light. Meanwhile, Lan Tianyang had already lost a leg. They appeared as miserable as could be.

However, to these two elites, such wounds were completely acceptable. As long as they managed to flee, they could still regenerate their severed arms and legs.

It was a pity that Xiao Gu wouldn’t give them such a chance.

He was unstoppable as he swung his Celestial King Bone.

Ling Han also didn’t rest, and he started to launch a flurry of vicious attacks at Xiao Jun and the others. He had to complete his job of exterminating evil.

“Aaah!”

The agonized wails of Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang were incessant. The power of a Celestial King had already been unleashed, so how could they—measly Ninth Lotus elites—hope to block it?

Death was their only fate.

Xiao Gu was filled with vicious rage, and after killing Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang, he immediately turned his attention to the other islanders. This was a one-sided massacre, and with a flash of celestial light, all of the islanders were immediately killed.

Only three people remained alive.

Ling Han, Xiao Gu, and Qin Wei.

Qin Wei was still alive, and this was because he was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, meaning that he had been able to block the attacks of the Eighth Lotus elites. Moreover, he was a “normal” person, so he hadn’t been targeted by Xiao Gu. Otherwise, if he had participated in that ceremony and offered his soul to the “deity”, he would have definitely been killed by Xiao Gu at this moment.

In any case, Qin Wei’s expression was extremely grim at this moment. His eyes were filled with terror as he looked at Xiao Gu.

“Xiao Gu, long time no see,” Ling Han said with a loud laugh.

“Yiyaya.” Xiao Gu’s vicious aura instantly vanished, and he flashed an innocent smile at Ling Han. “Xiao Gu, long time no see.”

‘Fine, he’s being a parrot again.’

Ling Han shook his head, and asked, “Xiao Gu, how did you come to the Celestial Realm?”

“Xiao Gu, how did you come to the Celestial Realm?” Xiao Gu repeated.

‘Holy... How long has it been? You still haven’t learned to talk yet?’

“How has your strength grown so rapidly?” Ling Han asked. He wasn’t willing to give up.

“How has your strength grown so rapidly?”

“Sigh...” Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh.

Xiao Gu also sighed in reply. “Sigh!”

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and he decided that it was only normal that Xiao Gu had come to the Celestial Realm. After reaching a certain level of strength, he could naturally shatter the gates to the Celestial Realm. However, the rapid growth of his power was still far too astonishing.

Thinking about it carefully, however, Xiao Gu wasn’t a human, and he was only a bone. Thus, he naturally didn’t face any barriers in advancing cultivation level.

Ling Han pushed these thoughts from his mind.

“Xiao Gu, oh, Xiao Gu, how can I communicate with you?” Ling Han really wanted to know what Xiao Gu had experienced during his lifetime. He had definitely been a Celestial King, so how had he died?

Moreover, he still detested these cultivators of the other system with such passion after dying. Just what had he experienced before?

It was a shame that Xiao Gu only knew how to say “yiyaya” or be a parrot. He couldn’t express his own thoughts at all.

Should he wait for Lu Hairong?

Ling Han removed the formation over the island. This way, Lu Hairong wouldn’t miss it when she passed by. However, perhaps Lu Hairong had already examined this region before. With her confidence as a Celestial King, she naturally wouldn’t examine the region a second time.

In any case, Ling Han would wait for now. At this moment, he was extremely interested in the two stone statues.

Pa, pa!

However, Ling Han’s eyes immediately widened in astonishment. This was because Xiao Gu didn’t give him any chance to investigate the two statues. Upon seeing them, he immediately lashed out to destroy them.

“Yiyaya.” Xiao Gu was extremely proud, and as he looked at Ling Han, it was as if he were asking for praise.

‘Holy crap...’

Right now, Ling Han only had himself to blame. He hadn’t told Xiao Gu beforehand, and he should have known that Xiao Gu had an immense dislike for evil.

There was nothing he could do about this. It was time to leave the island.

Ling Han chopped wood to make a boat, and Qin Wei was also doing the same thing. However, he didn’t dare to approach Ling Han and Xiao Gu. Instead, he hid far away, and he worked hard by himself.

Meanwhile, Ling Han also let the Empress and the others out from the Black Tower.

The Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had both seen Xiao Gu before, so they weren’t surprised by his presence. However, Hu Niu and Bewitching Maiden Rou were both astonished upon seeing him. Shi Lei and Shi Yu more so started to exclaim in surprise, shouting about how they had two stepfathers.

“Huh? Why do you look the same as Niu’s Ling Han?” Hu Niu asked as she looked Xiao Gu up and down.

“Huh? Why do you look the same as Niu’s Ling Han?” Xiao Gu instantly became excited upon seeing so many new people.

“Why are you so strange? Not only are you copying someone else’s appearance, but you’re even copying other peoples’ words.”

“Why are you...”

“So fun!”

“So fun!”

There was a glimmer in Hu Niu’s eyes, and it was clear that she was enjoying playing around with Xiao Gu.

Even though Ling Han wasn’t a skilled craftsman, he still managed to construct a boat after a day of work. This boat was only around three meters long, and it was only around one meter wide. In any case, it only needed to hold one or two people. After all, there was still the Black Tower.

Ling Han and Xiao Gu boarded the boat. Meanwhile, the others returned inside the Black Tower.

Even though the boat was small, it had been constructed from trees that grew in the boundless seas. Thus, it could easily block the sea waves, and there was no danger of it capsizing.

Moreover, with Xiao Gu as a guard, their safety was also not a problem. Even if they encountered Sea-King-class creatures, Xiao Gu could still scare them away by activating his Celestial Bone.

17 years later, the small boat successfully reached the seashore.
