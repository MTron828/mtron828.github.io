Chapter 1228: Freeloading Some Heavenly Tribulation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After arriving in the Immortal Realm, Yun Yong Wang, Kang Xiu Yuan, and Chen Rui Jing had never forgotten about the Lower Realm. They had worked extremely hard in these past 10,000 years, and they hoped that there would come a day where they could destroy the Five Sects and free the billions of beings in the Lower Realm.

Right now, two of them had already become Level Five alchemists. Meanwhile, Chen Rui Jing had put his focus on cultivation, and already advanced to the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. At this rate, perhaps they would be powerful enough to oppose the Five Sects in 1,000,000 years or so.

Destroying the Five Sects was their motivation; it was their lifelong goal.

However, someone was suddenly telling them that they had already opened the sky and allowed the Lower Realm to ascend into the Immortal Realm. This plunged them into a state of existential confusion.

‘F*ck, what should we do in the future?’

“T-then what about the Five Sects in the Lower Realm?” Kang Xiu Yuan asked with a dazed expression.

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “They’ve been annihilated, of course.”

‘Annihilated! How domineering!’

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang were both incredulous. The Lower Realm opening the sky and ascending to the Immortal Realm was such a significant turn of events, so why would the Five Sects keep their mouths shut? However, the more they thought about this, the more it made sense. Perhaps this news was only limited to the upper tiers of the Five Sects. That being the case, how could outsiders like them know about it?

After all, if news got out that the Five Sects were refining the beings of an entire realm into a pill, could they escape the fate of being annihilated?

There was a strange feeling in their minds as they looked at Ling Han. Not only was this young man supremely talented in alchemy, but he had also come from the Lower Realm. Moreover, his name was Ling Han. Their minds couldn’t help but wander to their late master.

However, 10,000 had already passed. Even if Ling Han—their master—hadn’t died, and even if he had advanced to the Shattering Void Tier, how could he have survived for 10,000 years? How could he have opened the sky a few years ago?

This had to be a coincidence. They both had the same name, and they both happened to be alchemy prodigies.

Kang Xiu Yuan changed the topic, asking, “That, um, Senior Elder, how much compensation should we give you?”

He was a Level Seven alchemist. Compared to him, the Han Lin Pavilion was far too small and insignificant.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “When I refine pills in the future, sell them without charging me a selling fee.”

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang were both astonished. This was far too beneficial to them!

Having a Level Seven alchemist sell his alchemical pills in their store would greatly increase the Han Lin Pavilion’s reputation and fame. This was incredibly beneficial to them, even if they didn’t charge a selling fee.

This... He was giving them all the benefits!

Sure, there were generous people in the world. However, this person was far too generous! He was so generous that they could barely bring themselves to believe it!

They asked some subtle questions, and tried to figure out his true identity. However, Ling Han still wanted to observe this place for a little longer, so he naturally didn’t reveal anything else. He kept his two disciples in the dark.

Meanwhile, Feng Po Yun, Helian Tianyun, Mu Rong Qing, and Ding Ping had already set off to gather information about the Five Sects. While they were at it, they would also search for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. 10,000 years had already passed, and people... would change.

Anyhow, prodigies like them would experience the greatest amount of growth through actual battles. Solely focusing on cultivation would only hinder their progress.

In the Black Tower, Guang Yuan and Zhu Wu Jiu finally completed their accumulation. They were going to break through to the Immortal level.

Ling Han brought them to some place outside the city. They endured their heavenly tribulation, and Ling Han also freeloaded on their tribulation.

Half a day passed, and Guang Yuan and Zhu Wu Jiu both looked like they had turned into burnt charcoal. If it hadn’t been for Ling Han’s lifesaving pills, they definitely would have died. Now, however, they had finally reached the Immortal level!

In their eyes, this was a miracle!

They had actually become Immortal level elites!

Meanwhile, as someone who had freeloaded on heavenly tribulation—Ling Han’s resulting tribulation was naturally formed according to his own tier—Ling Han’s hair wasn’t disheveled at all. He had studied the secrets of heaven and earth while enduring the heavenly tribulation, and he had turned these secrets into his own power.

He unclasped his hand.

Weng!

Devastating arcs of lightning flashed through the air. This lightning certainly wasn’t the same as the lightning of ordinary lightning-element cultivators. Ling Han’s lightning was filled with a domineering might and a rhythm of dao.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “After freeloading on several tribulations, I’ve finally grasped a shred of heaven’s might!”

The Divine Demon Sword danced above his head. As Ling Han’s God Tool, the Divine Demon Sword was naturally marked with the same martial intent as him. Thus, it also possessed a shred of heaven’s might.

If he unleashed the Divine Demon Sword at this moment, perhaps ordinary elites at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier would all fall to their knees. Perhaps they would submit to the power of heaven’s might.

Zhu Wu Jiu and Guang Yuan both kneeled to Ling Han, and said, “Thank you for your help, Young Master Han!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If it weren’t for Ling Han, the limit of their cultivation would have been the Spiritual Ocean Tier. They wouldn’t have been able to surpass this tier. Moreover, if they hadn’t followed Ling Han, they would still be ordinary people in the Great Ling Empire, even if they had ascended to the Immortal level.

Coming across Ling Han was the best thing in their lives. Meanwhile, them choosing to follow him was the best decision in their lives. Otherwise, why were there only four followers by Ling Han’s side?

Ling Han waved his hand and signaled for the two of them to rise. There was no need for them to return to the Black Tower anymore. They could walk their own paths now.

He could hasten their progress, yet he had to control how much he did so. By forcefully dragging the level of two people who were slightly above ordinary to the Mountain River Tier, he had pretty much squeezed out their full potential. In fact, he might have exhausted their potential.

If he tried to improve their cultivation any more, even an unlimited number of alchemical pills would be useless—they would simply be killed by heavenly tribulation.

After returning to Big Trade City, Zhu Wu Jiu and Guang Yuan took turns being stationed at the Han Lin Pavilion as representatives of Ling Han. They would notify Ling Han if there were any important matters. Meanwhile, Ling Han studied the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

He would rake in even more wealth if he could refine this pill.

Can Ye and Yuan Cheng He also left Big Trade City. They headed to the vast mountain ranges outside the Big Trade City, where they would battle against bandits and improve their combat skills. They had stayed in the Black Tower for far too long, and if they didn’t gain any battle experience, it was possible that they would become negative-star idiots like Hu Feiyun.

In this peaceful environment, Ling Han continued to study the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.

Theoretically speaking, Level Eight Divine Pills were the limit of what Sun Moon Tier elites could refine. However, one’s cultivation level wasn’t a reflection of their alchemy level. Perhaps a Level Seven alchemist would only be at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, while an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier could only become a Level One alchemist.

One’s cultivation level simply determined the limit of their alchemy level. After all, alchemy required one to have a powerful divine sense as well as control over powerful flames.

Ling Han had already reached the Sun Moon Tier, and thus the highest level of pill he could refine was Level Eight Divine Pills. Moreover, with a divine sense as powerful as his, perhaps he could even refine Level Nine Divine Pills when he reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier.

Treasure Forest Pavilion.

“Oh? The Han Lin Pavilion actually has an alchemy prodigy who defeated Alchemist Li?”

The person who spoke was a shapely woman. She sat with her legs crossed, and her split dress revealed one of her long and pale legs. It was especially slender, and it was as smooth as jade.

Her voice was sweet and enchanting, and those who were present all felt an itch in their hearts. However, upon remembering her status, none of them dared to let their feelings show. They simply answered her question with a respectful “yes”.

She was the person in charge of the Treasure Forest Pavilion’s Big Trade City branch. Her name was Lin Yuqi, and she had only been here for less than three months. According to rumors, Lin Yuqi was the lover of some great elite in the headquarters of the Treasure Forest Pavilion. However, that person’s wife couldn’t tolerate her, so she was assigned to this branch to escape her wrath.

Who dared to have any improper thoughts about her?
