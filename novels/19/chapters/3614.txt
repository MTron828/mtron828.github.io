Chapter 3615: Palace at the bottom of the lake

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The magnet was about to break.

Ling Han hurriedly mustered up his remaining strength to increase the strength of the Destructive Energy.

His spiritual power was already close to exhaustion. If he still couldn’t break through the magnets, then he really had no other ideas.

In fact, he was already channeling too much energy at this moment, and he felt like his head was exploding.

It was loosening, loosening, loosening. Ling Han struggled strongly, and his whole body immediately floated upwards. Meanwhile, the two magnets had joined together, but if one pulled hard now, he would discover that the magnets were very easily separated.

Because the structure inside had been severely damaged by the destructive energy, the magnetism was naturally not strong.

Ling Han couldn’t hold on any longer, and hurriedly entered into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. The instant he entered, he saw a flash of light in the distance.

How could there be light at such depths at the bottom of the lake?

With this vague thought in mind, Ling Han immediately passed out after entering the gourd. Vaguely, he seemed to hear Tang Yun’er calling out, ‘Damn Ling Han, why are you in such a miserable state? Don’t faint, or else who will cook for me…’

This damn child only knew how to eat. He would definitely deal with her when he returned.

He finally fainted. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After sleeping for who knew how long, Ling Han was finally awoken by a feeling of suffocation.

“Ling Han, what are you playing at?!” Tang Yun’er said through gritted teeth. “You committed suicide by jumping into the lake, but what does that have to do with me? Why do you insist on taking me with you?”

She had gone out for a while previously, yet was almost crushed into pulp by the water pressure. Thankfully, she still had a rare treasure on her, which took effect in time, allowing her to escape back into the gourd.

However, though the space inside the gourd wasn’t small, it couldn’t withstand the breathing of two people who were only expending the air without any replenishing of the air content. The air content in the gourd was getting lower and lower.

She still didn’t know how to conserve and hold her breath, and Ling Han didn’t know after he had fainted, so he expended most of the air.

Ling Han snickered, and said, “Don’t be anxious. I’ve almost recovered, so I’ll bring you out now.”

His physique was really tough. He had only slept like this, and his external injuries had mostly recovered, and his Spiritual Power had also recovered slightly. However, if he wanted to return to his prime condition, he still had to return to the shore.

“You’d better hurry up, or I’ll become a ghost from dying of suffocation!” Tang Yun’er stuck out her tongue. “If I die, I’ll hang behind you every day to scare you!”

Ling Han chuckled. He exited the gourd, and was just about to float upwards, when he suddenly recalled the glimpse of light he had seen when he had entered the gourd.

He stopped… there should still be enough time for him to look around for it.

The water pressure was astonishing, but Ling Han had already withstood it for so long previously. Furthermore, it was under the pressure of the magnets. Now, he was naturally slightly more relaxed, mainly because his physique had been cultivated too toughly, and was too comprehensive.

Otherwise, even if someone cultivated Seventh Extreme, his internal organs wouldn’t be able to withstand such pressure, and his heart would explode.

After circling around the lake, Ling Han indeed managed to spot that streak of light again.

He hurriedly swam towards that place.

Though he could not unleash the speed that he should have in the lake, with enough strength, it was convenient no matter where he was. With a tap of his foot on the bottom of the lake, a massive power instantly exploded, pushing him forwards like a swordfish.

However, there weren’t even any living beings of the Water Element at the bottom of the lake. This place could crush all existences of Mystery Realm Tier.

As Ling Han neared, the streak of light became larger and larger, gradually revealing its true appearance.

Ling Han couldn’t help but look surprised. That was actually a palace!

There was actually a palace at the bottom of the Cold Water Lake?

He soon arrived within the vicinity, and saw that the whole palace was enshrouded in a screen of light. He tried to stretch out his hand to touch it, and shockingly discovered that this screen of light was actually like dirt, and his hand had squeezed inside just like that.

Ling Han’s curiosity was really too great. He practically did not hesitate, and his whole person squeezed in as well.

After taking a step, he suddenly felt his body become lighter.

The water pressure had disappeared.

Yi, this was an empty space. There was not even a drop of water here.

Ling Han was astonished. He knew just how terrifying the water pressure was, yet the light screen that he could easily pass through was actually able to block it?

This was filled with contradiction.

“Ah, I’m about to suffocate to death!” Tang Yun’er came out of the gourd, breathing heavily.

After entering into this space, the Essence Nurturing Gourd naturally replenished the air content, letting the little loli know that she had “already” left the bottom of the lake.

“Yi?” She swept an eye over the surroundings, and couldn’t help but reveal a curious expression. That was because there was an ocean all around them, and ahead of them was a massive palace. This scene was something that she had never expected.

“Ling Han, where have you kidnapped me to?”

Ling Han tapped her lightly on the head, “No one kidnapped you.”

“As if,” the little girl mumbled.

Since he was already here, he had to go and take a look no matter what.

At present, they were in the plaza in front of the palace. Each brick was like white jade, bright enough to reflect one’s reflection, and could more or less be used like a mirror.

Tang Yun’er took one step, and she almost slipped. This instantly piqued her interest, and she began to slide on ice.

“Come play!” she giggled.

No matter how mischievous she was, she was still a child.

Ling Han smiled, and strode towards the palace gates.

One step, two steps, three steps… After taking a few steps, Ling Han couldn’t help but stop in shock. This was because the palace gates weren’t the slightest bit closer.

He turned around to take a look, and discovered that he had not advanced the slightest bit.

What the hell was this?

Ling Han stared fixedly at his feet, then continued walking. One step, two steps, three steps, his steps were normal. When he turned around to look again, he still hadn’t taken a single step.

But wasn’t the little girl ice-skating?

Hold on.

Ling Han walked around the outer circle of the palace. As expected, he immediately felt a change in perspective.

Yi, they could only circle around, and could not approach?

Ling Han circled the palace once, but no matter which direction he walked towards the palace gates, he was unable to advance the slightest bit.

He thought for a moment, then came to a position directly opposite the palace gates. He decided to just forge his way ahead from here.

“Ling Han, this place is so strange,” the little loli said. “It’s definitely been set up with a formation. However, it’s too brilliant, and I can’t find a trace of it at all.”

Ling Han expressed his agreement. He activated his eye technique, but couldn’t see any traces of formations.

It could only be said that the person who had set up this formation was too brilliant.

Since that was the case, Ling Han decided to walk forwards single-mindedly.

Worse come to worst, he would just have to waste some time, but there might be an astonishing opportunity inside — just by how strange this plaza was.

He began to walk, but if he used the little loli beside him as a reference, he did not move the slightest bit.

Imminent Skyline activated, and it was the same. His body could only be seen to be trembling, but his position did not change in the slightest.

Ling Han stopped. The burden from Imminent Skyline was too heavy, and he couldn’t hold on for much longer.

He was simply advancing at a normal pace, his gaze sharp.

Half a day later, Tang Yun’er finally cried out that she was hungry.

Ling Han threw out food for her to heat up, which made the little girl very displeased, complaining that Ling Han was committing child abuse.

Ling Han had a feeling that this might be a test..
