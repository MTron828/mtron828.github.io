Chapter 2188: Encountering Second Brother again

The air here was extremely thin, causing a group of people who had cultivated to the celestial level to actually have difficulties with breathing. It could not be denied that the power of the heaven and earth was really too frightening. No matter how much you struggled, you could still only play within the limits allowed by the heaven and earth.

You see, you had thought you had already transcended, but in truth, you could not escape from the palm of the heaven and earth at all.

The expressions of Ling Han, Yan Xianlu, Cheng Zixin, and the others were all slightly ugly. Their ambitions were lofty, and their pursuit was to escape from the shackles of heaven and earth, but from the look of things now, it was easier than done.

Perhaps only after becoming Celestial Kings would they just barely gain the right to play against heaven and earth. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King was equal to the heaven and earth, and the only method to transcend heaven and earth was to become a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han clenched his fists, his resolve even firmer than before.

“You can do it!” He continuously encouraged the women, and Cheng Zixin and his group could not understand this. Even Yan Xianlu could not really accept it.

As they saw it, cultivation should be emotionless. How could one possibly reach great accomplishments with so many concerns on his mind?

Not only did Ling Han prize romantic affections, he also had a large number of lovers, and he could actually progress quickly to stand out from the rest even with that? Inconceivable!

The further uphill they went, the more frightening the thinness of the air became. They had all sunk into a powerful state of suffocation, their breaths becoming extremely hurried. They all felt that the air they inhaled with each breath was not enough for their use, and they could only suck in large mouthfuls of air with each inhalation.

But the more this was the case, the greater the toll on their stamina, causing them to feel extremely horrible, wanting nothing more than to just lie down and rest to their heart’s content.

If they lay down here, they would never be able to wake up again.

Though the heaven and earth wanted to nurture talent, what was the use of trash without a firm determination?

Surpassing Ling Han’s expectations, none in Helian Xunxue’s group fell back, nor did any one of them truly pass out. Instead, they all gritted their teeth and forged on. Even Yi Shuangshuang and the Lunar King were no exceptions.

They could see a great many people fallen on the ground on their way. Some still had a sliver of life, while for others, even their spirits had been destroyed.

Climbing the Dragon’s Gate Mountain, and leaping over the Dragon’s Gate had never been an easy feat, but was instead filled with danger.

Ling Han did not interfere by drawing those people that had fallen on the ground but were still alive into a Spatial God Tool. Perhaps, there were some among them that had great willpower, and could emerge victorious over the heaven and earth, overcome their own limits, and stand back up with their own power, right?

This was a deadly test, as well as a great opportunity.

Over a dozen days later, they suddenly felt their breaths tremble, and that feeling as if they could die from suffocation at any moment disappeared.

As it turned out, they had already walked out of the test for the second stage.

Instantly, everyone slumped onto the ground, panting heavily.

“This test from heaven and earth is really harsh,” Cheng Zixin panted. At this time, he couldn’t bother with his image as a monarch tier anymore, and flopped onto the ground, his forehead covered with sweat.

Fu Zhou put on a calm air, and asked, “It’s just tempering your willpower. Brother Cheng, could it be that you can no longer take it?”

Cheng Zixin pointed downhill. “If you’re so capable, then you can just go downhill and do it again.”

“I’m no idiot. I wouldn’t do something so senseless.” Fu Zhou naturally refused. If he really fell for this provocation, then he would really be an idiot.

Again, Ling Han took out some Primordial Heart Nurturing Pills for everyone. This alchemical pill was already a great item for recovering Origin Power, and added with his Sixth Refinement, not only were its recovery effects even better, the immunity to this alchemical pill would also be far lesser than with other alchemical pills.

Very soon, everyone had recovered their vitality, and became energized again.

“I will definitely not come a second time to this damn mountain,” Yan Xianlu declared, shaking his head.

“Haha, that’s exactly what I thought.” He Xinjue laughed.

They were just about to continue the climb when they heard sounds of battle coming from the distance. Very soon, four people appeared in their sight. However, it was not a battle of two against two, but rather a battle of three against one.

The sole person had fallen into a disadvantage, but his movements were great and wide, possessing the domineering air of one who was an emperor, and all subjects would be bowing in submission to him. He was steady in his defense, and was still far from defeat. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In fact, this was possibly him looking for an opening, and he could possibly launch a fierce counterattack at any moment, turning the situation on its head.

“Yi, though this person’s fist technique isn’t that polished, it has a supreme air of dominance.” Fu Zhou immediately looked stunned.

He Xinjue nodded. “That’s right. I have a feeling that this fist technique was created by this person himself, but limited by cultivation level, the power of the fist technique is still not very strong. However, because he has invented it himself, it is the path that suits him the best, so he is able to show might that is beyond expectations.”

“To say nothing else, merely with this air of dominance, this powerful self-confidence, this person would definitely become greatly accomplished.” Cheng Zixin also gave a very high assessment.

However, Ling Han’s mouth was half gaping, a stunned expression on his face.

“Yi, isn’t this Second Brother?” Hu Niu asked, slanting her forehead. She naturally went along with the way Ling Han addressed him.

“The Rain Emperor!” The Empress also nodded.

This man that was battling three people alone, and had been given such a high assessment from Fu Zhou and his group was actually the Rain Emperor!

After entering into the Celestial Realm, the Rain Emperor had left by himself not long after. He planned to journey in this new heaven and earth, and was unwilling to be protected by Ling Han, because his ambitions were lofty, and to be protected by another was not the path he walked.

Since they parted, it had been more than 10,000 years, and Ling Han had never gotten any news of the Rain Emperor. He had not thought that he would actually encounter him here.

“Rain Emperor, you won’t be able to escape today!”?Xiu, another figure charged out, joining the battle.

This time, it had become a battle of four against one.

However, that was not the end of it. Another two figures appeared, charging forwards with twisted expressions on their faces, similarly aiming directly for the Rain Emperor.

Six against one!

Even if the Rain Emperor had astonishing battle prowess, in a battle of six against one, and with his cultivation level restricted to Mountain River Tier, his advantage of the Fifth Severance and the like had been endlessly reduced. Immediately, he was in a critical situation.

“You have joined our great sect but for 3,000 years, and not only have you become a Holy Son, you actually even dare to think of cultivating the Mighty Benevolent Scroll?”

“That is a supreme secret technique that only the sect master can cultivate!”

“What would we be then?”

“We’ll send you on your way to the afterlife today!”

The six of them all used ultimate moves, each aiming to deliver a fatal strike.

Though Ling Han was not yet sure of the situation, with his second brother in danger, how could he possibly just sit by and watch??Xiu, he immediately charged into the battle with a battle cry, brandishing his fists, and launching an offensive at the six of them.

“Second Brother, I’ve come!”

The Rain Emperor only glanced at him, and then burst into laughter. “Fourth Brother, you have come just in time!”

Peng!

Ling Han forcibly tore an opening into the battle, and stood back to back with the Rain Emperor. The brothers were both bare-handed, yet were like two great emperors from the primordial age, capable of suppressing one and all.

Among the group of six, a white-robed young man shouted, “Who are you? Why are you interfering?”

“Are you an idiot?” Ling Han scoffed. “This is my second brother, I am his fourth brother, and you are asking me why I am interfering?”

The six of them couldn’t help but feel gloomy. Wasn’t the Rain Emperor all alone? Why had a fourth brother suddenly appeared out of nowhere? Then wouldn’t there be a first brother and third brother as well? Where were they then?

“Friend, a wise man looks after his own hide. We are determined to kill him today, and if you join in, we will only be killing another person. What’s the point?” a green-robed young man advised. “We are all monarch tiers, so do you think you can stop us?”

Ling Han scoffed. So what if they were monarch tiers? He couldn’t even remember how many monarch tiers he had killed by now. He stated calmly, “You are trying to compare numbers, aren’t you? Come, wives, brothers, come out for a show.”

“Hehehe.”

“Hehehe.”

Hu Niu, Yan Xianlu, and the others all stepped out, each of them exuding a forceful aura.
