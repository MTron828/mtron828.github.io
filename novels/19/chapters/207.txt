Chapter 208: Can Ye

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

The opponent was already subdued without unleashing the attack.

Nangong Xing didn’t dare to move a single bit. He felt as though if he were to move slightly, it would incite an attack like a thunderstorm from his opponent, and he definitely wouldn’t be able to block it.

This perception of it made him completely hopeless.

His opponent was only a mere Element Gathering Tier, but how could he pressure him so utterly…?

Ling Han unleashed his sword—with a slash, nine swords made of Origin energy shot up into the air like the rising sun, radiating and harsh to the eyes.

Nangong Xing’s body was instantly struck flying and he fell onto the ground with a thud, blood oozing out from his chest.

Guang Yuan’s eyes opened wide—he clearly saw the strike this time. Ling Han’s attack sent out nine sword lights, and each sword light condensed from spiritual qi into a sword of Origin energy. This was a bit surprising, but it wasn’t unacceptable; what was surprising was that the power of each sword of origin power reached the level of Ling Han’s full-strength attack.

In other words, in that instant, it was equivalent to nine Ling Hans attacking Nangong Xing. How could Nangong Xing block it?

He couldn’t help but think… if it were him, how would he fend off this attack? The answer surprised him—he could only rely on power that far surpassed Ling Han’s and send Ling Han flying with attacks covering a large area so as to avoid confronting the attack head on.

In short, at the same tier, he wouldn’t be able to block this strike.

How could it be so terrifying?

“Cough! Cough!” Nangong Xing fell onto the ground, spitting out blood continuously. Ling Han already held back in his attack, but it still heavily injured him.

The others were speechless; was this really the cultivation of first layer of the Element Gathering Tier? The first layer of the Element Gathering Tier could be this fierce?

Ling Han sheathed his sword, and said dismissively, “Take him away, don’t let him lie here like an eyesore!”

Nangong Xing let out a hacking cough, and another mouthful of fresh blood came out. So he didn’t even count as an opponent in Ling Han’s eyes. As he was carried away by the masses, his gaze was fixed on Ling Han.

‘This definitely won’t be over so easily, it definitely won’t!’

“Young Master Han…” Zhu Wu Jiu didn’t know what to say. Although he was moved that Ling Han shielded him, he saw it as pointless; how could an Element Gathering Tier martial artist go against Hu Yang Academy?

He certainly disobeyed the academy’s rules.

“If you exploited your strength to act violently, then I obviously wouldn’t help you.” Ling Han looked at him, and continued in a dignified tone, “But Nangong Ji deserved to be punished, so I support you on this case.”

Zhu Wu Jiu grit his teeth. If the academy sought someone to blame, he would definitely take on all the charges, and not involve Ling Han.

Guang Yuan watched in amusement. According to his previous impression, Ling Han was just a nouveau riche that brandished money to such extreme degrees that Earth and Water Faction could only lower their head. Now, it appeared that this guy was also hotheaded, daring to confront Hu Yang academy head on.

Could Earth and Water Faction even compare to Hu Yang Academy?

However, this guy seemed to also have a strong network—even the Imperial Guards had to give him face; it was not as though he were completely reckless.

He couldn’t help but let out a smile. This youngster was interesting, and he wanted to see how Ling Han would handle things hereafter.

Hmm?

Ling Han suddenly turned his head and looked far away. A youngster approached, his left shoulder empty, obviously missing a limb. In Hu Yang academy, there were only two people who had lost their left arm: Feng Luo, and… Can Ye!

However, Feng Luo was missing his right arm. The person here still had a perfectly fine right arm, so there was only one possibility.

One of Hu Yang Academy’s three great core disciples, Can Ye, who Lian Guang Zu personally instructed.

Teacher and master, that was a completely different concept.

Teachers took the academy’s salary, instructed the students’ cultivation, and taught what was universal to the academy. What about a master? It was one who imparted with great care their entire life’s leanings; the intimacy of such a relationship was like that of father and son.

Lian Guang Zu had only one disciple, and that was Can Ye, a crippled youngster.

Can Ye approached slowly, carrying a long saber on his back. His gaze was sharp like an exceptional saber unsheathed, which gave the feeling that even if a large mountain blocked his path, he would be able to split it open.

“He has the presence of a master!” Guang Yuan said surprisingly. Can Ye’s cultivation level was not worth mentioning, but that presence somewhat moved him.

Ling Han also nodded. He was optimistic about this youngster who had the potential to become a saber master; this feeling was something he felt from Sword Emperor and Twilight Saber Emperor. But Can Ye was still too inexperienced, showing only the first signs of such a possibility.

“That attack just now, it’s strong!” Can Ye looked at Ling Han with an intense urge to fight.

“You want to spar?” Ling Han broke into a wide grin. ‘This guy’s not bad.’ He already had the thought of taking him under his wing.

Can Ye pondered, then said, “Against that move, I’m only ten percent confident of neutralizing it.” He paused, and then said, “If I study the method of neutralization by pondering it for three days, I would have the assurance of thirty percent.”

He was quite honest.

“Then let us battle three days later?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Can Ye shook his head, and said, “Your cultivation level is too weak, I can split you in two with one strike; you have simply have no chance to unleash your sword.”

This was quite honest, but too honest that it was uncomfortable to hear.

Ling Han laughed mischievously, then said, “Let’s make a bet!”

“Bet what?” Can Ye asked.

“Let’s fight, and if you can’t beat me, then you’ll be my sidekick,” Ling Han said.

“You won’t suffice as my opponent, you’re only going to be cut down by a single slash,” Can Ye said coldly but with surety, emotionless like a saber. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“That may not be.” Ling Han laughed. “Let’s fight, and if I get killed by you, then that’s my fate; if I don’t die, then you’ll be my sidekick.”

Can Ye made him think of Twilight Saber Emperor. Perhaps, one day, this guy really might become the second saber emperor.

Can Ye pondered it, then said, “Whenever I attack, I never hold back, and you really will die.”

“I’m not afraid of death, so what are you afraid of?” Ling Han cracked a smile. “Come, come, come, and submit as my sidekick.”

Can Ye looked confusedly at Ling Han. No matter how he looked, his opponent had no sliver of a chance to survive. He was naturally indifferent, not only neglecting social intercourse, but also life. In his eyes, a person’s life was no different than a dog’s life.

Since that was so, he spoke no more, and unleashed his saber.

With the long saber in hand, his temperament instantly changed drastically—from a cold crippled youngster into a reaper. Those cold eyes and the imposing murderous spirit shocked even Guang Yuan a little as the latter involuntarily cracked his fingers, feeling an impulse to kill this youngster as he felt danger.

“Ling Han!” Liu Yu Tong called out lightly of nervousness.

Hu Niu’s eyes shone brightly. Can Ye’s murderous spirit made her feel a wisp of intimacy, but when she found that this murderous spirit was directed at Ling Han, the little girl instantly erupted fiercely, growling at Can Ye.

“Niu Niu, this opponent is mine!” Ling Han smiled, and brandished his sword with a move reminiscent of a flower, his expression solemn.

Can Ye was certainly strong, even he had to be cautious.
