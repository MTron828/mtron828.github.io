Chapter 1755: Battling Ding Yaolong

“If anyone can survive three moves from my Battle Beasts, I will only cripple your cultivation level and spare your life,” Ling Han said calmly.

With a point of his finger, the white tiger immediately pounced out.

Murderous aura soared into the skies, and the coldness was menacing. This White Tiger was formed with the Xuanyin Source Water as its core, so it was naturally incredibly and extraordinarily cold. Furthermore, the Xuanyin Source Water was a Source Power of the heaven and earth; what kind of awesome existence was that?

Ding Shuang raised his hand, making a motion to parry this attack. But he had just raised his hand when an endless coldness attacked him, completely encasing his body in ice. He could not even move another finger.

Ice crystals had formed on his hair, his beard, and his brows, and his blood naturally had also been frozen. His whole person had become an icicle.

The White Tiger pounced, and with a slight wave of its paw, pa, Ding Shuang’s whole figure exploded into shards.

Both form and spirit were destroyed.

Under such extreme coldness, his spirit was also imprisoned in his mind. Even if he had wanted to flee, he could not, and could only be destroyed along with his physical body.

This Ten Beasts Technique was really frightening! The Source Power of the heaven and earth was really terrifying!

All the members of the Ding Clan were transfixed with shock as they watched.

The grand elder that was like a god of war in their eyes was actually not even a match for the Battle Beast that this evil criminal had released.

Just how wide was the power gap between them?

“Destroy them!” Ling Han stated calmly, and the three Battle Beasts immediately began an open slaughter.

They were completely invincible, and even a first severance grand elder was no match for them, so what were mere Genesis Tiers and Eternal River Tiers worth?

Wherever the White Tiger passed, everything would be frozen in ice, and every time its paw slammed down, it would all be shattered. The Vermillion Bird flew past, turning all into ash and not leaving the slightest bit of remains behind, and as the Thunder Beast stomped past, the divine punishment of lightning would blast madly, exploding everything into pieces.

“I haven’t tried this move out yet.” Ling Han used the Cracking Light Sphere.

This was a secret technique of lightning which he had obtained from the Heavenly Tribulation Fluid. However, he had never used it before, because this was a powerful move that made no difference between enemies and allies, and would attack all but the user. And he had not encountered any situation before this that it was him alone versus an army of 100, or 1,000, so there was naturally no need for him to use this move.

But as for now? He would use this to destroy the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan.

Boom!

The Cracking Light Sphere exploded, and the terrifying power of lightning rippled out, its destructive power astonishing.

This move needed a long time to accumulate power before it could be used. Furthermore, the longer he built up power, the stronger it would be. In fact, it could reach an extent that it would kill him first before anything else. Thus, when even Ling Han felt strained, the power of this strike could be imagined.

And it was with this strike that one-tenth of the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan had been immediately destroyed.

“The gap is too big!” Yet Ling Han shook his head. When Han Lu had moved previously, he had razed this place to the ground very easily and very casually, but his full effort was actually only capable of destroying one-tenth of the place.

This was his gap with a fourth severance.

...But didn’t he realize? He was only a first severance now, and furthermore, he had just reached the middle stage of the first severance, so wasn’t having so much battle prowess already awesome enough?

Were you really planning to defy the heavens?

Ding Xiaochen was also killed in the chaotic battle. He did not know the reason for all this, and only thought that everything was due to the fact that he had trifled with Ling Han. His heart was filled with who knew how much regret.

After death, how was he supposed to be able to face his ancestors?

“Ling... Han!” A voice that was filled with endless ice and fury rang out; the strongest elite of the Ding Clan had finally appeared.

Ding Yaolong!

Previously, he had been cultivating in seclusion. Even if there was little hope, he had not given up the idea of attempting to break through to the Dividing Soul Tier, but reality only gave him disappointment time and time again.

When he sensed that unforeseen misfortune had happened within the clan, he finally emerged from his seclusion. Then, he saw that their f***** ancestral shrine was almost close to being destroyed again!

Ding Yaolong was almost about to go crazy. The destruction of the ancestral shrine occurred twice! And both times were because of Ling Han. “You evil brat that deserves death!”

Did you have some kind of natural repulsion with the Ding Clan or something?

Ling Han stopped. His three Battle Beasts also returned immediately. Ding Yaolong was a fourth severance, and Ling Han definitely could not afford to underestimate him.

“Today, I have come on behalf of the Hu Clan to seek an accounting for some old debts, and the next time, I will come on my own behalf, and raze, your, Ding, Clan, completely, to, the, ground!”

The Hu Clan?

Suddenly, Ding Yaolong’s heart clenched. He sinisterly exclaimed, “So you are a surviving dreg of the Hu Clan! You really deserve death, and we did not completely obliterate the whole lot of you!”

At first, he had thought that with the intervention of a Celestial King-level force, the Hu Clan was definitely finished. He had not thought that there would be any survivors that would become this huge calamity for them in the future left.

Ling Han chuckled. There was no need for him to explain the exact details of his experience.

“Then allow me to send you on your way!” Ding Yaolong declared coldly. He shot out a fist, and the power of time surged. This secret technique of the Hu Clan was indeed powerful, and it had now become the strongest technique in the Ding Clan’s repertoire.

The three Battle Beasts roared at the same time, and pounced at Ding Yaolong.

Sha, sha, sha. The Battle Beasts pounced towards him, but they were destroyed by the power of Tide of the Ages. This secret technique was too powerful. As long as the other’s cultivation level was inferior, any attack would be pointless. In fact, even if the opponent’s power surpassed his own, he might not be able to wound Ding Yaolong, either.

Below Celestial King Tier, the Regulations of Time were really too strong.

Ling Han used Lightning Flash, and did not resist Ding Yaolong head-on.

At present, he, too, could just barely sustain a few blasts from a third severance elite, but definitely would not be able to hold up against a fourth severance—if he insisted on taking it head-on, it was possible, but he would have to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and he would not be able to last very long.

“Again!” He reformed another three Battle Beasts, and it was very easy for Ding Yaolong to disperse this attack. However, it was not realistic that he would be able to hurt the Battle Beasts that had the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water as their core.

He had added the secret technique of time onto the three Battle Beasts, using Tide of the Ages to vie with Tide of the Ages. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Go!”

The three Battle Beasts pounced forwards once more, and launched an offensive against Ding Yaolong. However, this time still did not reach Ling Han’s expected target. Though the Battle Beasts repeatedly attacked, in the clash against the power of time, their own power of time would also disappear rapidly. When the power of time in them had vanished completely, their bodies would also immediately wear and age before disappearing.

This gap in cultivation level was really quite big, after all.

But Ding Yaolong got a scare. He had not thought that those three Battle Beasts had nearly torn through his defenses!

This young man was really too frightening and too freakish!

If he did not get rid of him today, the Ding Clan would really be in danger.

Ding Yaolong summoned a bell. It was completely inky black, and he had just taken it out, but it had already caused a change in the heaven and earth. A dark cloud was cast over the skies above the Ding Clan Manor and rippled endlessly. There were flashes of lightning flickering in it, as if a divine punishment was about to descend, yet there was still something missing.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be surprised. Ding Yaolong definitely did not seem like he was about to break through, so this heavenly tribulation should have come for the bell.

Could it be that this treasured tool had just been completed, drawing the descent of a heavenly tribulation?

That was not right. If the heavenly tribulation had really been about to descend, it would have long since descended by now. Why would it seem like it was about to descend and yet not like this?

“That is divine punishment.” A voice rang out from the sidelines. It was the large black dog. Its tongue lolled out of its mouth as it said, “If someone has done too much evil, and caused too much harm to the peace of the world, it would draw a punishment from the heaven and earth.”

It was nothing unusual for the large black dog to appear and disappear mysteriously. Perhaps it had been drawn here because it saw that there was a large commotion breaking out here. What surprised Ling Han was that the large black dog had actually also advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier.

Where did it go to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier and become a Celestial?

Ling Han frowned, and said, “But the target of the divine punishment is that bell.”

“That must be because the process of refining this bell involved too many sins, and its existence is not permitted by the heaven and earth,” the large black dog said solemnly, and showed a rare expression filled with killing intent. “This Ding Clan must have committed many crimes, and caused much bloodshed for this precious Tool.

“Brat Ling, there is no need to give me any face. Slaughter this old geezer, and then destroy that bell!”
