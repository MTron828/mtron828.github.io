3000 Attacking

Yi Long was a Third Tier, and most of the people here were Second Tiers, with a few being First Tiers, so he could still hold on for the moment.

But the problem here was that the other side would attack without any scruples, but he had his reservations. To say nothing of killing, he did not even dare to wound them.

This naturally caused him to be extremely passive. He had powerful strength, yet could only unleash 10-20% of it.

Before long, he was hit a few times, which caused him to stumble and bleed from the corner of his mouth.

Pitifully, he still did not dare to counter with his full power, fearing that what he had been falsely accused would become true.

He continuously shouted, “I didn’t do it; listen to me!”

Unfortunately, this kind of shout was completely drowned out by the furious roars of the masses.

Moreover, even if someone heard him, they would ignore him. Who would believe him?

And just like this, Yi Long was continuously attacked in this way, his injuries becoming more and more serious.

This kind of development was something that even the instigator, Ling Han, had not foreseen.

He had only wanted Huang Feng to pass on a message so that he would die in an appropriate location. Then, he would draw out Feng Wuding. Who would have thought that Yi Long would be the one to take the blame?

Yi Long’s heart felt like he had suffered terrible injustice, and he felt an indescribable regret.

Why had he sided with the Feng Alliance?

Though there was a Son of Destiny in the Feng Alliance, as well as five Seventh Tier ultimate elites, which was overwhelmingly awesome, these people all treated him like an outsider. Their treatment of him was filled with rejection, and they did not accept him at all.

He was a dignified Third Tier, so what need was there for him to suffer such injustice?

And now, it was even worse. He was being treated like a murderer. If he really was killed, there wouldn’t even be a place for him to proclaim his innocence.

“Stop!” A cold shout rang out, filled with intimidating might.

Instantly, half of the people stopped attacking, and the other half also slowed down their attacks. In a few breaths’ time, the situation was completely under control.

A person with a tall, sturdy figure walked over, every step having a majestic gait.

“Lord Sealed Emotion!”

“Lord Sealed Emotion!”

Many people immediately paid their respects. This was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate who was extremely freakish. In fact, even Feng Wuding had praised him before. Thus, even if this person wasn’t from the Genesis World of the last era, everyone still gave him a lot of face.

Sealed Emotion walked over. His eyes swept over Yi Long, and he frowned slightly.

When had he ever felt so aggrieved?

Those that could become Heavenly Venerates were definitely all prodigies of each dimension. Along the way, they would definitely have a glorious history of crushing other prodigies.

Thus, Yi Long was definitely feeling extremely aggrieved at this moment. How could he not feel extremely aggrieved?

“What’s going on?” Sealed Emotion asked solemnly.

Yi Long hurriedly recounted what had happened previously, and repeatedly swore a dao oath, saying that if he told half a lie, he would never be able to advance to the Fourth Tier.

For Heavenly Venerates, there was no heavier oath than this.

Thus, everyone began to hesitate. Could it be that Yi Long was telling the truth?

“Go and investigate,” Sealed Emotion said.

This was very easy to verify. Previously, there had been a total of 24 people in Huang Feng’s group.

As expected, a great many people verified that Huang Feng’s group of 24 had indeed gone out together.

“What did they go off to do?” Sealed Emotion asked again.

Someone had participated in the previous fight with Ling Feifan, and told them about this matter.

“In other words, Huang Feng and the others had probably gone to seek out Ling Feifan today,” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable analyzed. “However, only one of the 24 people returned.”

“Humph, the problem must be Ling Feifan.”

“Lord Sealed Emotion, that Ling Feifan is only a Second Tier. It’s definitely impossible for him to accomplish this,” someone said in disbelief.

Sealed Emotion shook his head, and said, “Although Ling Feifan is nothing to worry about, his grandfather, Ling Han, had many friends in the past, and there is no lack of Fourth Tier elites among them.”

“What you mean is that a Fourth Tier elite has interfered?”

Sealed Emotion nodded. “We’ll know when we go and take a look.”

“I know where he is,” someone volunteered. Previously, he had followed Ling Feifan to Ling Han’s place. However, these people didn’t dare to violate the camp’s rules too much by barging into someone else’s stone house to commit a crime. Otherwise… um, they would have long since died.

“Lead the way.”

This time, it could be considered a public outrage. At least several hundred people moved out at the same time. Though the majority of them were Second Tiers, with so many people moving out at the same time, the commotion could be considered vast and mighty. Wherever they passed, other forces would be alerted.

“What is it? Does Feng Alliance want to start a war?”

“How dare they? Our Bai Alliance is not much inferior!”

“The Tiger Alliance is unafraid!”

It had to be admitted that out of the many forces, the Feng Alliance was the strongest in terms of power. Not only did they have an advantage in numbers, Feng Wuding, who was within their ranks, was also the Son of Destiny, and his battle prowess was outstanding.

Furthermore, Feng Wuding still had five Seventh Tier ultimate elites behind him. What force could compare to that?

The Lin Clan could be considered awesome, but there were only three Seventh Tiers and one person with Seventh-Tier battle prowess in their ranks.

Now that the Feng Alliance looked like they were about to go to war, how could they not feel anxious?

Thankfully, the members of the Feng Alliance did not head towards the territory of any force, and only passed them by. Instead, they arrived at an inconspicuous corner.

Where were they going?

Many forces were all curious, and all came over to watch the excitement.

Very soon, the people from the Feng Alliance had arrived in front of Ling Han’s stone house.

Sealed Emotion nodded at one of them, and said, “Go and knock on the doors.”

“Yes, milord.” That was a Second Tier. He hurriedly obeyed respectfully, and ran over to knock on the doors.

“The people inside, listen up, come out quickly!” the Second Tier called out loudly.

Ling Han planted restrictions within the stone house which cut off the transmission of noise. Then, he opened the doors and walked out.

The moment he saw him, Sealed Emotion’s eyes narrowed to small slits.

Boom! A powerful aura rippled around him, and it was uncontrollable.

Sealed Emotion had naturally heard of Ling Han’s freakishness. Even a Seventh Tier ultimate elite had once been captured by him and become his prisoner. Although Golden Silk Moth had managed to escape afterwards, it still couldn’t conceal Ling Han’s strength.

Fortunately, Ling Han himself courted death by entering the Forbidden Land of the Genesis World from the last era. That was a place that even Seventh Tiers could not barge into. There had been no news from him for hundreds of billions of years, so he had to have died.

Hence, though Sealed Emotion felt rueful, he was still pleased by the fact that this freak had finally disappeared.

Yet now that he saw Ling Han walk out alive, how could he not be shocked to the point of panic?

The Second Tier didn’t recognize Ling Han, and questioned him loudly, “Was it you who killed Huang Feng?”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “That’s right. I was the one who killed him.”

Hearing Ling Han admit it, Yi Long was filled with indignation. He hurriedly jumped out, pointed at Ling Han, and said, “You bastard, look at just how badly you have implicated me!” Just look, he was still covered with blood. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ling Han was surprised. Why did this guy jump out and cry about being wronged?

Even if his strength was outstanding, he could not have imagined that there would be such an unexpected twist.

Ling Han ignored him and only looked towards Sealed Emotion.

So many years had passed, and he had finally seen this old bastard again.
