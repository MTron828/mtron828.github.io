Chapter 1714: My name is Ding Xiaochen

Having sustained such injuries, even if a Severing Mundane Tier or Dividing Soul Tier elite stepped out, it would be very hard to deal with it, because this had already fused with his body, and if things were done forcefully, it would cause frightening damage to the physical body.

Ling Han’s using his bare hand to grab the fiery blade would merely be seeking his own suffering.

‘You can’t underestimate Xiao Sheng just because your first strike succeeded; this man was a genuine king tier, with indomitable strength— Pu!’

Changsun Liang was still thinking when he saw that after Ling Han had grabbed the flaming blade, he immediately sent out a flying kick that landed on Xiao Sheng’s chest. Peng, this guy was again sent flying, and crashed back towards the Empress.

T-t-this..... Changsun Liang gaped, extremely speechless.

He had seen clearly. Ling Han’s hand was completely unscathed, and not even a single small charred spot was to be seen.

‘F***, this is too freakish!’

“Strange, his action was clearly not very fast, and I could distinctly see him move, but why was Xiao Sheng caught off guard like that? Putting aside any sort of defense, he couldn’t even manage to stretch out his arm to block the blow.”

“That’s right, even if it had been me, I wouldn’t have been like that.”

“He must have been scared off by Ling Han’s aura as a king tier, and lost all power of resistance.”

“En, that must be the case!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Everyone could not understand what they had seen, and thought that they had found a logical explanation. However, those elites above the Severing Mundane Tier had a different opinion.

“A seemingly light touch is actually heavy, a seemingly slow action is actually quick.”

These powerful figures all bore stunned expressions, their hearts throbbing wildly at Ling Han’s strength.

Though every single move that Ling Han made could be seen incredibly clearly, as if anyone could easily block him... it was another issue whether they actually could manage to do so. However, in truth, unless Xiao Sheng’s reaction speed and speed of attack could speed up another 10 times, it would be completely impossible for him to block Ling Han’s blows.

Ling Han’s movement was too fast, as if it was lightning. One could see how a lightning bolt descended incredibly clearly, but if you had seen lightning, and still wanted to stretch out your hand to block it, how could that possibly be done?

But practically no one could attain such a level, not even any of these powerful figures could do so.

...If they made a move now, they would definitely be even faster than Ling Han, but in terms of a battle of equals, being able to force their opponent to watch helplessly, unable to even stretch out a hand in an attempt at defense, was merely something delusional.

It had to be known that Xiao Sheng was already a true king tier, and only an equal could match his battle prowess in this world. How could anyone possibly overwhelm him?

This young man was going to defy the heavens!

Peng, peng, peng, peng. After being sent flying over to the Empress’s side, Xiao Sheng would be able to counter at least, and was only defeated after exchanging a few dozen moves with the Empress. Pa, he was again sent flying. Yet when he had reached Ling Han’s side, he really could only suffer being beaten. Whether Ling Han was punching him with a fist, striking him with a palm, or kicking him with a foot, he would be sent flying with a single strike.

The gap in their power was clear with one look.

Everyone could feel their hair stand on ends. Changsun Liang and Xiao Sheng were already prodigies of the highest grade, but now another two had actually appeared, and they were completely superior to Xiao Sheng.

Two!

‘Hiss, my gods.’

The sect master of the Black Moon Sect broke into a smile. Though Changsun Liang had indeed been injured heavily, Xiao Sheng presently was even worse off now. He was hit back and forth like a ball, sustaining both injury and humiliation.

Xiao Dong’s expression had naturally changed completely. His eyes were shooting fire. He had never thought that the situation would take such a sudden turn like this.

Xiao Sheng had actually been defeated, and it was not a narrow loss, but a complete defeat, being defeated by two people at the same time.

How could it be so?

He couldn’t help but want to interfere. Three such young king tiers had actually appeared in the Black Moon Sect. If they were given a few billion years’ time, who would be able to match them among two star forces?

“Hoho, Old Man Dong, what are you planning on doing?” the sect master of the Black Moon Sect said, all smiles, though he had sealed off any possible attempt for Xiao Dong to make a move.

If the latter made any sort of move, then the attack would only be directed at him.

The two of them had exchanged blows many times, so the sect master of the Black Moon Sect naturally had no fear of him.

Xiao Dong looked coldly at the sect master of the Black Moon Sect, and suppressed his urge to make a move. Since Xiao Dong had not admitted defeat, it would not be appropriate for him to call a halt to the battle, either.

But was this really a battle?

Perhaps the exchange between the Empress and Xiao Sheng could still be considered a battle, but the exchange between Ling Han and Xiao Sheng was definitely not one. That could only be called a one-sided beating. By now, Xiao Sheng didn’t know how many punches and kicks he had endured from Ling Han, his whole figure dejected and depressed.

“I don’t want to play anymore,” the Empress said to Ling Han. Her patience had never been the best, and she would usually eliminate directly whomever she disliked.

Ling Han nodded. His wife was tired, so they should stop playing.

He stretched out a hand, and grabbed Xiao Sheng. With a smile, he said, “Young man, you have to learn humility in future. See, I am so strong yet I am not proud or arrogant, so what are you worth?”

These words rendered everyone speechless. The two of you had been kicking him around like a ball, so how much prouder could you be? But when they recalled how arrogant Xiao Sheng had previously been, everyone felt that their anger had been vented.

This kind of character needed to be taught a good lesson.

This felt incredible!

With a casual toss, Xiao Sheng created a slight groove on the ground, sliding until he finally stopped at the side of Xiao Dong’s feet.

This was practically a provocation!

Ling Han actually did not want to casually become enemies with a Dividing Soul Tier elite, but with him having thrashed Xiao Sheng publicly and in such a humiliating manner like this, the feud between him and the Xiao Clan was confirmed, so what need was there for him to be reserved any longer?

Xiao Dong picked Xiao Sheng up, though he wanted nothing more than to slap the latter. They had anticipated great results for tens of thousands of years, and had just barely enjoyed the taste of victory when they were forced back where they had started.

But no matter what, Xiao Sheng was still the most outstanding descendant of the Xiao Clan, and had boundless prospects. Furthermore, this was not entirely Xiao Sheng’s fault, either, but rather that Ling Han and his wife were too overwhelmingly strong.

“Young man, what is your name?” Xiao Dong spoke up, his tone very even. For a character like him who had lived for who knew how many millions and millions of years, he naturally knew very well to restrain his killing intent.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and answered, “My surname is Ding, and my given name is Xiaochen.”

Pu!

Ding Xiaochen had just been watching with envy from the sidelines, and when he heard these words, he almost spluttered out a mouthful of blood.

‘You can’t f****** screw me over like this!’

Indeed, he very much wanted to become well-known, and become the strongest in the younger generation, but did not want to do so via such a means.

Yi, why did he feel that this method was a little familiar and a little bit like a trap?

In the past, the Han Clan had charged to their doorstep, and said that someone from their Ding Clan had been insolent, destroying the physical body of a prodigy from their Han Clan. But the Ding Clan had forbade any of their clansmen from entering into the Ancient Realm after Ding Zizhen’s incident.

Moreover, the Ding Clan did not have the ability to send a Genesis Tier into the Ancient Realm. This would require at least a Dividing Soul Tier elite.

Could it be that that matter was connected to Ling Han? Impossible, impossible, Ding Xiaochen immediately shook his head. He must have thought too much.

He hurriedly called out, “Senior, Senior, this junior is the real Ding Xiaochen. That person is named Ling Han, so please don’t fall into his trap and be deceived, Senior.” He had no wish to become the target of a Dividing Soul Tier elite. That would really be grumbling that he wasn’t dying fast enough.

Hearing these words, everyone couldn’t help but show expressions of disdain.

It was presently the battle between the Black Moon Sect and the Xiao Clan, so how could you weaken the morale of your own side? And calling out “senior” in such a boot-licking way at that, ptui!

But to Ding Xiaochen, this was also the attitude that he should take. Otherwise, was he supposed to call out “old geezer” or “old fart”?
