Chapter 2050: Retrieval

There was no need for Small Tower to tell him. Ling Han had no plans on missing out on this Bloom of Dao, and judging by Small Tower’s tone, it seemed like there was not just one Bloom of Dao.

He walked towards the Bloom of Dao, and the flower swayed lightly, as if it was going to disappear into thin air.

When Ling Han had come close enough, and stretched out his hand to pluck it, a breeze passed, and this Celestial Flower suddenly turned into uncountable pieces that shot out in all directions, and were gone in an instant.

‘What’s going on?’

“The Bloom of Dao contains a great many Celestial King Tier-level Regulations. By itself, it is in an incredibly fragile state of balance. Thus, when it encounters the slightest external stimulus, it will shatter,” Small Tower explained slowly.

“You clearly knew, yet did not remind me at all. You clearly did it on purpose!” Ling Han pointed out.

Small Tower did not say anything, and this was considered tacit admission.

As expected of the proud Tower, proud and petty. Hadn’t he just teased it a bit? And it had immediately gotten its payback.

“Then how am I supposed to retrieve it?” Ling Han asked.

“Try as much as possible to withhold your own aura, and not let loose the slightest bit.” Small Tower did not act mute this time.

Ling Han sighed, and continued his advance.

Half a day later, no Bloom of Dao appeared ahead. Instead, there was another streak of Dragon’s Breath that manifested into a formidable man that aggressively attacked him.

“Could it be that these people were the Celestial Kings from the Dragon Tribe?” Ling Han cast Great Clash of Source Powers, which instantly killed this opponent, while he himself spat out a mouthful of blood.

To be able to instantly kill an opponent that was superior in strength to him with a single move, the time he had to channel the Great Clash of Source Powers would also be slightly longer. This would cause considerable damage to Ling Han himself, so throwing up blood was really very normal.

Thankfully, he immediately channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and the organs that had been damaged immediately recovered.

Small Tower couldn’t help but say, “Though I do not approve of your reckless actions, if you hadn’t come up with this ultimate move, you would’ve only been able to flee pathetically when you had encountered the spiritual marks left behind by these Celestial Kings.”

Which also meant that these opponents were really those Celestial Kings of the past, but naturally did not even have a hundred-millionth of their actual strength. Or rather, they had been forcibly limited to the Dividing Soul Tier, or perhaps it depended on the individual—if it was a Dividing Soul Tier they faced, they would be limited to the Dividing Soul Tier, and if it was an Immortal Palace Tier, they would be at the Immortal Palace Tier.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Therefore, my insistence is very reasonable.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“However, I still cannot agree.” Small Tower’s tone was very firm. “You do not have to take this kind of risk. In the future, if you can advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, you will discover that it is completely meaningless to depend on these external powers.”

“I know.” Ling Han nodded. “However, without sufficiently powerful strength now, I am no match for Ji Wuming.”

“But Ji Wuming is a reincarnated Celestial King, and a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at that. It is very normal that you cannot match him now,” Small Tower advised.

Ling Han shook his head. He would not be able to match Ji Wuming in the Severing Mundane Tier, nor in Dividing Soul Tier, or Immortal Palace Tier. Even after he advanced into Celestial King Tier, he would still not be able to. He had to go as far as Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier to be able to truly catch up to him.

Just how many years would he have to be suppressed for?

He could not wait for so long, nor was he the type to.

In a battle of equal cultivation levels, he did not want to lose to anyone.

Small Tower did not speak anymore. Perhaps it was precisely this kind of character that led to Ling Han’s present strength. Without this kind of striving determination to be the best, and to follow the prescribed order, Ling Han’s apex would perhaps be limited to only Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

This was already enough for him to smile proudly down on the entire Celestial Realm, but to really surpass the norm, he had to become a Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han continued his advance, and after destroying another few streaks of Dragon’s Breath, a second Bloom of Dao finally appeared ahead of him.

He cautiously advanced, completely concealing his own aura. However, the Bloom of Dao was incredibly sensitive. When he had gotten as close as nine meters, this Bloom of Dao began to tremble, as if it was going to disperse at any moment.

Ling Han quickly stopped, and stretched open his right hand. The Regulations of Space activated, and isolated this part of the heaven and earth.

As expected, the Bloom of Dao stopped trembling.

Ling Han advanced another step forwards, adjusting the Regulations of Space all the while, and ensuring that he was in a state of “emptiness” for the whole process.

Close, close, close.

The Bloom of Dao was already close at hand. Ling Han stretched out a hand. The Regulations of Space wafted. They were clearly visible, yet it also seemed like they did not exist.

He had grabbed it!

With a thought, Ling Han had stowed the Bloom of Dao into the Black Tower.

Haha, done.

Ling Han did not manage to check out his harvest, but instead continued his advance. There was no need to immediately refine the Bloom of Dao, and he would absolutely stow it in the Black Tower first. Furthermore, he could still pass it over to be used by the Empress and the others.

He continued his way forwards, and destroyed a great many streaks of Dragon’s Breath. At the same time, a great amount of Dragon’s Breath was also tempering his body. His brute power had increased greatly, as if he had truly turned into an Immortal Dragon himself, capable of moving the heaven and earth with a single movement.

Though the giant dragons cultivated Regulations, they did not nurture Origin Power, but rather they would be able to destroy the heavens and earth with a raise of their dragon claws with pure physical power.

“My physical body is becoming stronger and stronger. In future, I may be able to become a wild beast in human form, capable of destroying the heavens and earth with a single movement.”

This definitely was just an illusion, unless the Dragon’s Breath he obtained could reach an endless extent. Otherwise, with limited Dragon’s Breath, there was naturally a maximum limit to the power boost he could get.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han suddenly stopped, and he turned around.

He had a vague feeling of lingering fear, as if some ultimate enemy was approaching.

Only in a short while, a figure appeared from the distance. He seemed to be moving very slowly, but in a few steps, he had already neared considerably. He was dressed all in white, as poised and elegant as a god.

It was Ji Wuming.

No wonder he would experience a feeling of lingering fear. This was indeed a great enemy, an extremely great enemy.

“I really had not expected that you, too, would be able to stimulate the black dragon bridge.” Ji Wuming seemed slightly surprised.

He had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in his last life, and had stopped at this cultivation level for innumerable epochs. It was possible that he had cultivated all the Regulations that could be cultivated at least once, so he had been able to easily stimulate nine golden dragon bridges, and subsequently gain the approval of the black dragon bridge.

But how did Ling Han manage to do so?

He was just in the Dividing Soul Tier, yet could actually equal him in the height of Regulations?

“The precious treasure of a Heavenly Venerable Tier is indeed extraordinary,” Ji Wuming stated calmly. “In the future, though I, too, may be able to step into this cultivation level, there is no harm in me studying it for reference first.”

Ling Han humphed, and retorted, “I fear you won’t have that chance.”

Ji Wuming was not angered, and only slowly said, “Young man, do you know how many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings have died in my hands?”

In the eyes of the world, Celestial Kings were the utmost supreme existence, and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were the great monarchs among Celestial Kings. Each and every single one of them could rule the ages, and they were truly invincible in the world. However, Ji Wuming was able to kill Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so just how powerful had he been at the time?

Ling Han showed no signs of weakness, and retorted, “Why does a real man need to boast about his past achievements? And when I advance into Celestial King, killing Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings will definitely be a small matter to me as well.”

“Hahahaha!” Ji Wuming suddenly burst out into laughter, shaking his head, and said, “Do you think just anyone can become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Those that can advance into this cultivation level would have to be monarchs among monarchs, and all of them would be unprecedentedly talented and genius prodigies.

“Fine, I won’t speak of my past achievements.” He stopped his laughter as his eyes became fixed on Ling Han. “You should hand over the treasure you possess now.”

“Ji Wuming, I, too, anticipate exchanging blows with you again very much.” Ling Han’s heroic spirit soared.

“You? Your only fate will be death!” Ji Wuming charged over, a green sword appearing in his hands. An ancient seal was emblazoned on it, and it exuded a supreme might.
