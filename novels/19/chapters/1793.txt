Chapter 1794: Drawing a Line

Luo Changfeng hurriedly ran over to break up the fight, saying, “Lady Zihe, calm down, calm down!”

It was clear that Ling Han’s physique was far too powerful, so much so that Zihe Bingyun would find it extremely difficult to suppress him even if she continued to fight against him.

Moreover, Ling Han seemed to possess a limitless amount of different techniques, so it was possible that Zihe Bingyun might experience the humiliation of having her bottom exposed again. Thus, it was better to stop the fight now.

Zihe Bingyun was wild with fury, and her eyes were filled with killing intent. However, she resolutely turned around and returned to the battleship above her.

She had a strong desire to kill Ling Han, yet she knew that she didn’t have the ability to do so. As for seeking help from the elites on the battleship? She more so didn’t have the face to do this.

If Ling Han were at the Dividing Soul Tier, the elites of the Zihe Clan would have immediately stepped forward to pummel him. After all, Ling Han would have been picking on the weak. Now, however, Ling Han was at the same cultivation level as Zihe Bingyun. In fact, he was even at a slight disadvantage. Thus, would Zihe Bingyun have the face to ask for help from the elites of her clan after losing to him? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Would the Zihe Clan tolerate such a useless successor?

Zihe Bingyun knew that there were definitely elites from her clan observing this battle. They were her guardians, and they were there to protect her from life-threatening dangers. At the same time, however, they were also there to observe her and analyze her performance. If her actions were unfitting for a clan successor, she would be immediately stripped of this position once she returned to the clan.

The path of cultivation was far too difficult. Even though she was confident that she could reach the Immortal Palace Tier by herself, she still needed the resources of her clan to reach the Ascending Origin Tier. In fact, she might even need the help of a Celestial King. Otherwise, it would be incredibly difficult and time-consuming to complete this step.

As such, she definitely couldn’t lose her position as successor.

However, she would definitely exact revenge one day.

Half of her soft and supple bottom had been exposed, so she naturally didn’t have the face to stay here any longer. If she didn’t return to the battleship, where else would she go?

“So pale and beautiful!” someone suddenly remarked.

Everyone turned around, only to see the large black dog.

He was surprisingly on the battleship, and no one knew when he had returned.

Apprehension crept into everyone’s minds. If Zihe Bingyun knew that the large black dog was present, perhaps she would explode with rage and command the battleship to open fire without any regard for the consequences. That would be equivalent to the attack of an Ascending Origin Tier elite, and everyone present would be killed in the blink of an eye.

Did the rage of a woman know any boundaries?

To say nothing of them, even Luo Changfeng was slightly scared upon seeing this. He quickly returned to his own battleship. However, before he left, he didn’t forget to send an invitation to Bewitching Maiden Rou and the Empress, asking them to come over to “play”.

No one had succeeded in inviting them before. However, everyone understood Luo Changfeng’s actions. After all, men always had their aspirations and dreams. Moreover, the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou were indeed breathtakingly beautiful and charming.

One after another, everyone took their leave. This place was a ticking time bomb that might explode at any time, so it felt far too dangerous to remain.

“Little Han, you have some of Grandpa Dog’s style! You know when to seize the opportunities. When fighting against beautiful women, you have to take some advantage of them no matter what. Grandpa Dog approves of you!” The large black dog ran over, causing the members of the Fu Clan to retreat in fright.

This large black dog was the embodiment of misfortune. Those who came into contact with him would all be screwed over.

In fact, Ling Han had become mortal enemies with a Celestial King Tier force simply with the dog’s waving to him!

Fu Gaoyun felt as miserable as could be.

How could he not?

He was one of the four potential successors because he had received the support of the two great alchemists. This support was because of Ling Han. Now, however, Ling Han had offended the successor of a Celestial King Tier force. As such, did Fu Gaoyun dare not to draw a line between himself and Ling Han?

What would happen if he didn’t draw a line between himself and Ling Han? The mighty beings in his clan would definitely kick him out from the position of potential successor. Otherwise, wouldn’t it appear as if they were provoking a Celestial King Tier force?

Everything was because of the large black dog’s greeting. His actions had completely destroyed Fu Gaoyun’s enviable position. As such, was he not the embodiment of misfortune?

Right now, even Cheng Zhong and the others were wearing expressions of indecision. They were already considering drawing a line between themselves and Fu Gaoyun. Of course, this was if Fu Gaoyun didn’t draw a line between himself and Ling Han.

Ling Han was rendered speechless. The large black dog was as toxic as always, yet the target of his toxic tongue possessed an unfathomable background this time. His actions instantly isolated Ling Han from everyone else, and the gazes of the others were as if they wanted to get as far away from him as possible.

“Brother Ling...” Fu Gaoyun said.

Ling Han waved his hand, signaling for him to stop. “I won’t drag Brother Fu into this mess. Farewell!” Upon saying this, he immediately left the battleship with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

Fu Gaoyun could also be considered as a friend, and Ling Han naturally wouldn’t drag his friends into his own problems. He would take responsibility for his own actions. After all, who told him to come across a troublemaker in the large black dog?

Fu Gaoyun sighed in his mind. He had to consider the bigger picture, so he could only apologize to Ling Han in his mind. He would deal with this when everything was over. However, would it be easy to escape after offending the successor of a Celestial King Tier force?

To say nothing of a Celestial King Tier force, even the Fu Clan would capture and control anyone who dared to “humiliate” him like that. When he became powerful enough, his clan would then allow him to personally exact revenge.

He could only pray for Ling Han’s safety and hope that he could successfully escape after entering the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

Fortunately, he had already given the Blood Dragon Armor to him.

“Little Han, wait for Grandpa Dog!” the large black dog shouted as he chased after Ling Han.

“Little Black, are you the reincarnation of misfortune? Why does nothing good ever happen when you’re around?” Ling Han asked with a sigh.

“Who said?” the large black dog retorted in displeasure. “Don’t slander me like that. Otherwise, I’ll gnaw your bum into mangled flesh! Say, that young woman’s bum was fairly shapely and supple. I’m sure it would feel amazing to grab.”

“Are you truly a dog?” Ling Han asked speechlessly.

“Brat, you can curse Grandpa Dog, but you can’t slander Grandpa Dog!” The large black dog patted his chest, and said, “I’m as authentic as can be, and I’m as purebred as can be.”

Meanwhile, the Empress’ expression was extremely cold as she gazed at the large black dog. It was because of this foolish dog that Ling Han couldn’t pursue that Nine Revolutions Charm Physique anymore. She was extremely ticked off about this. Fortunately, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm was about to open soon, and they would still be able to come across Bewitching Maiden Rou there.

If push came to pull, she would simply convince Ling Han to force himself on that woman. With the Empress’ personality, she wouldn’t feel a shred of guilt in doing this.

Ling Han and his wives found a spot in the desolate plains to rest. Anyhow, they could use the Black Tower.

Several days passed, and numerous additional battleships arrived in the surroundings. Among them, Ling Han saw a ship that carried the emblem of the Lunar Sect.

Bei Xuanming had definitely come. After all, he was only at the second severance. Perhaps other Holy Sons had come with him as well.

Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. He had already offended Zihe Bingyun, and Fu Gaoyun had more so drawn a line between the two of them. That being the case, he could wantonly cause trouble after entering the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

Holy Sons, Holy Daughters, and successors? He would kill them if they dared to provoke him!

Did they think he was some small fry they could humiliate as they pleased?

Boom!

There was a loud rumble, and the mists on the desolate plain started to slowly dissipate, revealing a path.

The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm had opened!
