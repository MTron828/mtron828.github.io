2673 Great Accomplishment of Celestial Physique

Ma Yuhai was still considered a notable figure, so not long after he had called to pay respects, He Yufeng granted him an audience.

“Spare me your complimentary remarks, I’m tired of hearing it,” He Yufeng said dully, being extremely blunt.

Ma Yuhai was slightly embarrassed, but the other party was on the same level as his own father, so how would he dare to have any objection? He quickly said, “Young Master He, something has happened.”

“What’s the matter?” He Yufeng turned to look at him.

Ma Yuhai suddenly felt he was under great pressure. This was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; one gaze nearly caused him to collapse. He adjusted his frame of mind, and then said, “Young Master He’s servant, Lord Qin Shuang, might have been killed!”

He Yufeng’s gaze turned severe, and Ma Yuhai immediately collapsed onto his backside on the ground.

This was the true power of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He Yufeng withdrew his gaze, and asked lightly, “How do you know?”

Qin Shuang was just one of He Yufeng’s minions, so He Yufeng naturally didn’t care whether the former was alive or dead, but he was one of his men, so if really someone had killed him, as the saying went, “one needs to consider who the master is before hitting a dog”—He Yufeng definitely would not let the matter go.

Ma Yuhai had initially made up a bunch of lies, but when He Yufeng cast him a glance, all those lies evaporated into thin air, and he quickly told the truth in full detail, not daring to add anything or spice it up in any way.

After hearing this, He Yufeng couldn’t help but sneer. “You have got guts, even daring to murder a disciple of the martial academy, huh?”

Ma Yuhai was just getting up from the ground, but when he heard these words, he sat down again in fright. While he was a supreme monarch star at the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven, he was completely but an ant when faced with a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“Qin Shuang died because of you. You will cripple both your arms, head on to Burst Cloud Volcano, and stay there for a year,” He Yufeng spoke again.

Ma Yuhai didn’t dare to have any objection; he nodded quickly, but his face was full of fear.

Breaking both his arms was not a big deal, but Burst Cloud Volcano was a dangerous place in the Flaming Frost Realm; its horrifying flames could easily melt even Divine Metal. Furthermore he had to stay on the mountain for a year; one could imagine how dangerous that could be. It would cause him extreme suffering.

But would he dare to say no? A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was no longer bound by any Regulations. What if He Yufeng became upset and killed him with a single strike?

“Yes!” Ma Yuhai said respectfully.

“Ling Han… this person who dares to kill my servant, I will make him pay a deserving price for this!” He Yufeng said again.

Ma Yuhai felt overjoyed immediately; a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was going to take action against Ling Han, so no matter how freakish the latter was, it would be of no use, as his life or death would completely depend on a mere thought of He Yufeng.

“Scram!” He Yufeng said in annoyance.

Ma Yuhai turned around and left at once as nothing good would happen to him if he was to anger a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. He had seen some top-tier prodigies who, taking for granted that they had some natural talent and some background, showed even the slightest disrespect in the presence of his father, and were crushed to smithereens as a result.

Heavenly Venerate was indeed an existence that surpassed Regulations. Even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was also seated in a high and lofty height, with divine might that could not be violated.

Again, the Wang Clan had sent over a large quantity of resources, which included quite a number of natural treasures. Ling Han cast a sweeping glance at them, and couldn’t help but show a satisfied smile.

In this way, his cultivation of Indestructible Celestial King Physique should be able to reach the ninth level.

For this, he cultivated in seclusion, and he succeeded after three months.

“It’s finally accomplished, the completed state of Indestructible Celestial King Physique!” Ling Han laughed heartily. How strong would his defense be now? Even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King bombarded him with all his might, his body would not be hurt. Even if he was hit by a Celestial Tool, or a monarch star or supreme monarch star at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven struck him, they would only cause minor injuries to his body.

“Unfortunately, it’s still a little far from reaching the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique. Even if I was to concoct alchemical pills like before, I reckon that it will take about 10,000 years to gather enough resources. However, the Celestial medicines accumulated by the Wang Clan over an epoch have already been completely used to concoct alchemical pills. Even if they were to procure more from various corners, how would they be able to keep up with my speed of concocting alchemical pills?

“It seems that if I want to achieve the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique, it will only happen at least after 100,000,000 years.”

Ling Han came out of seclusion and just sat down when he saw Zhu Xuan’er coming over with an invitation card while saying, “Husband, you have got something else to work on.”

“What is it?” Ling Han asked casually.

“He Yufeng’s banquet.” Zhu Xuan’er raised the invitation card in her hand.

“Who is He Yufeng? I don’t know him.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Husband, he isn’t just anybody, but one who has recently broken through to reach the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier,” Zhu Xuan’er said with a straight face. “Furthermore, He Yufeng’s father is a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate! You have no idea now how many people in the martial academy take pride in receiving He Yufeng’s invitation. However, the number of invitations issued is extremely limited, and only the real prodigies and descendants of Heavenly Venerates would qualify.”

Ling Han thought about it, and suddenly realized. “So it is this He Yufeng.”

“Husband knows him?” Zhu Xuan’er asked curiously.

Ling Han shook his head. “I don’t know him, but I killed one of his men.”

Zhu Xuan’er only rolled her eyes. He hadn’t yet met with this person, but already there was enmity; this was an ability that only her husband would possess, right?

“Then it’s better that you do not attend this banquet,” she said.

Ling Han shook his head. “Since they have invited me, why should I not attend?”

“But—” Zhu Xuan’er wanted to say more, but when she saw Ling Han’s expression of indifference with a trace of determination, she knew that it would be futile to further dissuade him. However, this was the martial academy, after all, so even He Yufeng wouldn’t dare to do anything, right?

He Yufeng’s banquet was scheduled to take place seven days later.

This date was more than half a year since he had officially become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Why did he delay to hold the banquet so late?

That was because the achievement of becoming a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would be a major event, and even within a transcendent dimension like the Flaming Frost Realm, it was normal to only have one or two appear in a single epoch. Given that currently prodigies from all over had gathered, and the prodigies of practically the entire Genesis World were gathered here, the frequency of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates popping up became much higher, so much so that more than 100 could be produced within an epoch.

On average, that would be one in every 100 billion years, which was still a pitifully small number.

Of course, for such a grand event, powerful figures from all sides would be invited.

However, as most of the Heavenly Venerates were fighting against Hysteria at the Realm Battlefield, and a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was still not Heavenly Venerate in their eyes, and not worthy enough to be on an equal footing with them, they naturally would not humble themselves to attend.

Even so, He Yufeng’s abode was still filled with as many Ninth Heaven Celestial King as clouds, and if they were not Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, then they had to have a background of the Heavenly Venerate level, otherwise they would not be qualified to even appear here at all.

Ling Han asked around, and only the large black dog had received the invitation among his group of acquaintances.

He went together with the large black dog, and came to the mountain where He Yufeng’s abode was located.

“Invitation.” The person standing guard at the foot of the mountain was actually a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. After examining the invitation for one person and one dog, he smiled at them, and allowed the two to go up the mountain.

“Brat, look, everyone else has carriages to travel around, while the two of us are traveling on foot.” The large black dog couldn’t help but complain to Ling Han as he watched all the carriages speed by. “Grandpa Dog is, after all, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, at the pinnacle of the Celestial Path, and can’t be seen in such a pathetic state.”

“Do you mean to say that we ought to go back and get a carriage to come here again?”

“No need to go through all that trouble, you can simply get down on all fours and serve as a mount for me,” the large black dog said very shamelessly.

“…Get lost!”
