Chapter 1209: Give Me a Retrial!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Hao had always been a successful genius.

He’d been born into a force with a Heaven Body Tier elite, and he had displayed an outstanding cultivation talent from a young age. He had always been as brilliant as the radiant sun in the sky, and people all revered his prodigiousness no matter where he went.

His family had extremely high hopes of him. Moreover, he was an invincible prodigy among those of the same generation as him. Everyone respected and feared him. In fact, he had managed to defeat all prodigies that stood in his way even after arriving at the Majestic Heaven Sect. He was the true cream of the crop.

He was blessed by the heavens, and he was destined to become a ruler of a region.

However, he had suffered great humiliation at the hands of Ling Han.

Although it wasn’t Ling Han who had defeated him, the fact remained that he had almost been beaten to death by Empress Luan Xing. In the end, he had lost a significant amount of his life essence.

This was a great stain on his name, and he would definitely exact revenge on Empress Luan Xing in the future. Right now, however, he would kill Ling Han first—he would collect some interest.

“Han Lin, killing fellow disciples is a serious crime! Not only that, but it’s also a despicable action!” His voice was cold, and he continued, “I suggest that we tie him up in front of the sect entrance and slice a piece of his flesh off every day. We’ll continue until he bleeds out and his life essence withers.”

‘So ruthless!’ everyone exclaimed in their minds.

It was extremely difficult for Immortals to die.

As long as their vitals weren’t obliterated, they could live on even if their limbs were severed or their blood was drained. After all, severed limbs could regrow, and blood could also be regenerated. However, these recovery methods all consumed one’s life essence.

Life essence couldn’t be seen or touched, yet it did indeed exist. In fact, there were sinister techniques that could suck one’s life essence and transform it into nourishment for the wielder of the sinister technique. Doing so would increase the wielder’s lifespan by a slight amount as well as aid the growth of their cultivation.

It was clear that Yang Hao wanted Ling Han to experience a slow and excruciating death. He would only die when his life essence completely ran out.

This was incredibly cruel!

Gao Huang and Hua Yangwen were both secretly alarmed. This young man was an extremely ruthless individual. They definitely couldn’t offend him.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Yang Hao, how pathetic of you! Come, come, come, suppress your cultivation level and fight against me. See how I wipe the floor with you!”

Yang Hao sneered, and said, “Who do you think you are? Do you have the right to fight against me?”

“Don’t say that I’m bullying you. If we were at the same cultivation level, I could give myself a handicap of one hand and one foot!” Ling Han placed his left hand behind his back, then cracked a grin, and said, “Actually, I can also handicap my right hand if you want.” He placed his right hand behind his back.

Arrogant, how extremely arrogant!

“Uncle Yang, why don’t we restrain him first. We can give him some heavy punishment to make him more obedient,” Gao Huang suggested. Although he was much older than Yang Hao, and although his cultivation level was also slightly higher, he still placed himself in an extremely lowly position.

It was fairly hard for such a proud person to act so subserviently.

Yang Hao nodded, and said, “Great idea! Restrain him!”

He gazed at Ling Han. How could such a measly being challenge him? Absolutely preposterous!

Ling Han’s heart shivered. They were finally going to bare their fangs. Once they did, it would also be time for him to enter the Black Tower. He would exact his revenge another day.

“Humph! It looks like you still haven’t learned your lesson yet! You’re still biting people like a mad dog!” There was a cold humph as Hu Feiyun walked over. However, the aura that radiated from her was far above the Mountain River Tier.

It was Empress Luan Xing!

Ling Han’s brows knit into a frown. He had already planned his escape. However, the actions of Empress Luan Xing could potentially derail his plans. After all, how could he if stay in his Black Tower if Empress Luan Xing was caught in a dangerous situation?

She had stepped in to help him, so how could he sit by idly? This was not to mention the budding relationship between him and Empress Luan Xing.

Yang Hao had never been afraid of anyone before. However, fear appeared on his face when he saw Empress Luan Xing.

He had been beaten senseless by her, so it was hard not to fear her.

Pa!

The empress lashed out with her palm, and Yang Hao was instantly sent flying. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Pu!

Clouds of blood exploded from Yang Hao’s body, and his life essence instantly started to wither.

He had been severely wounded!

Fortunately, the empress had held back. Otherwise, how could Yang Hao have survived the attack of a Heavenly Body Tier elite?

“Heh, Madam, this is already the second time!” an icy voice said.

This was... the Majestic Heaven Sect!

Two figures materialized in the air. They both looked to be 50, and an air of Primal Chaos shrouded their faces, making it impossible to see their features clearly. Four heavenly bodies hovered behind their bodies.

“Father!” Gao Huang and Hua Yangwen were delighted to see these two figures.

They were the fourth and sixth disciples of Venerable Trinity—Gao Fang, the leader of the Gao Faction, and Hua Yongning, the leader of the Hua Faction. They were both elites at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Madam, you’ve gone too far!” Hua Yongning said coldly. “This is the Majestic Heaven Sect, not your Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire!”

“You two want to obstruct me?” Empress Luan Xing asked calmly. However, there was a domineering air about her voice.

In terms of aura, who could compare with a ruler? Moreover, Hua Yongning and Gao Fang weren’t even sect leaders. Although their cultivation levels were the same, the might of Empress Luan Xing was far above their.

However, Ling Han interrupted, “Your Majesty, this is my private matter. Please don’t interfere!” He frantically winked at her as he said this.

‘You already know that I have a Spatial God Tool... So, who can harm your man?’

Empress Luan Xing saw this, yet she said, “He’s my subject, and I heard that you people wanted to interrogate him. So, I merely came here to look on.”

‘Look on your mom! Would “looking on” cause blood to explode from Yang Hao’s body? Would it cause his life essence to wither even further?’

However, there was genuinely nothing they could do if a Heavenly Body Tier elite insisted on twisting the facts... unless they fought.

There was a look of apprehension on Hua Yongning’s and Gao Fang’s face. They were up against an empress, and they definitely couldn’t underestimate her. However, they were only apprehensive. After all, they believed that this was merely a spiritual mark left by Empress Luan Xing. As such, there would be a limit to her power.

“Fine, we’ll let you look on if that’s what you so desire!” Hua Yongning and Gao Fang both stood with their hands clasped behind their backs. With them keeping watch, there was no way that Empress Luan Xing could cause any great trouble.

Yang Hao slowly crawled up from the floor, his eyes burning with anger.

‘Motherf*cker! What about me? Was I hit for nothing?!’

“Aren’t you going to begin the trial?” Empress Luan Xing asked as she looked at Shen Kuo. Her aura was devastating, and images of celestial bodies and galaxies flashed through her eyes. Her might was so formidable that Shen Kuo almost spat blood.

He couldn’t help but grimace. ‘Begin what f*cking trial? Haven’t we already stripped him of his status as a seed and expelled him from the sect?’

He hesitated for a moment before reannouncing the decision of the judges.

Pa!

He was immediately struck and sent flying by Empress Luan Xing upon finishing his sentence. He felt as if all of his bones had been broken, and he realized that he couldn’t crawl up from the floor.

“I disagree with this decision. Redo the trial!” Empress Luan Xing said in a domineering manner.

“Madam, you’ve gone too far!”

Hua Yongning and Gao Fang finally reached their limit. Did she really think that this was the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire?

“Heh, young lady, I let the matter slide when you caused a commotion in my sect the first time. However, you’ve come to cause trouble again. The person you struck just then is my disciple!” A terrifying voice traveled over, causing everyone to shiver to the depths of their soul.

This was the overwhelming pressure from a transcendent being!

Venerable Trinity had come!
