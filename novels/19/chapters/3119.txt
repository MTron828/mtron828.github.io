3120 Searching for formation foundations

Ling Han wasn’t interested in expressing his opinion. Firstly, he and He Miaoyin weren’t friends, and secondly, even if he did, He Miaoyin probably wouldn’t appreciate his kindness. Instead, she would think that he was deliberately trying to sow discord.

It had nothing to do with him!

Ling Han stood at the side, waiting for the great formation to be activated.

Nie Yang, Lao Liyan, and the others were also here. They had to try their best and not allow themselves to have any regrets.

After a while, Sun Jianfang, He Guan, Lao Feng, and the other elites walked over together.

In this era, every cultivator was an extremely precious resource. However, only those whose cultivation had reached Ten Meridians were qualified to truly become a powerful elite.

Those with Nine Meridians and above could be called king tiers.

Sun Jianfang and the others were publicly acknowledged king tiers. Although they were all very old, it was as if there were dozens or even hundreds of ferocious tigers hidden within their bodies. Once they unleashed their might, it would shake the heavens and earth.

“Everyone knows the rules,” Sun Jianfang said simply. “The first person to walk out of the great formation will be our sect’s Dao Child. In addition, you can attack as you wish in the great formation, and need not worry about the consequences. This is because this ancient formation is used as a test. If a fatal situation occurs, the person will be automatically sent out.

“However, this also means that he will have lost the qualifications to fight for the Dao Child position.

“Alright, go in.”

He waved his hand.

Instantly, those who were determined to fight for the position of Dao Child entered the great formation.

The ancient formation hadn’t been activated yet, but after Sun Jianfang placed a jade pendant in it, this great formation was finally activated. The originally clearly visible ground and forest gradually became blurry, as if it was covered in a thick layer of fog.

Those who entered the great formation hurriedly broke into a run. The best strategy was none other than to rush out of the great formation as quickly as possible without engaging in any battle.

However, as soon as they ran, they realized that something was amiss. This was because the surroundings that they had clearly seen earlier had become incomparably blurry. Their visibility was only about three meters, and they immediately lost their sense of direction. They couldn’t tell which direction was north, south, east, or west.

“Wait for me,” Li Changdan said softly to He Miaoyin. His voice was gentle and intoxicating.

He Miaoyin nodded, and said, “I’ll wait for you at the exit. The first person to walk out will definitely be you!”

Li Changdan smiled proudly and strode toward the ancient formation.

On the other side, Ling Han also told his little handmaiden to go back first, while he himself leisurely walked towards the great formation.

This great formation was like a monster that had devoured many people. Mist billowed, as if it had emerged independently from this mountainous region.

Ling Han strolled along as he observed his surroundings.

Since this was a formation, there was no way one would be the first to leave just by relying on their speed.

Therefore, the most important thing at the moment was not to run out, but to observe.

If he could see through what formation this was, he would be able to break through it directly. If he couldn’t, he would have to see through at least its fundamentals. Otherwise, it would only be a waste of time and energy.

Ling Han seemed to be walking casually, but he was actually taking in his surroundings. He made comparisons of his observations, and reconstructed them in his mind as he went along.

He had never seen this formation before, but he had also studied formations in the Genesis World, so there were bound to be similarities. Furthermore, he was now boosted by various attributes, with affinity, natural talent in alchemy, and, of course, formations.

He captured the slightest change, and all kinds of enlightenment arose in his heart.

‘If I take three steps here…’ Ling Han took three steps to the left, and the path ahead suddenly opened up. The fog seemed to have instantly disappeared, and returned to its original appearance.

‘Not bad.’

Ling Han walked towards the exit, but he had only taken a dozen steps when the fog appeared once again.

He hadn’t been able to break through this formation; he had only managed to understand a tiny bit of its secret.

‘If I could master this formation and set it up around my residence, would I still need to worry about being ambushed?

‘Also, such an arrangement would greatly increase the safety factor when exploring the wilderness.

‘The reason why this formation could be set up successfully is definitely because of the formation foundations buried in every corner.

‘Mm-hm, I’ll go dig out the formation foundations and learn the formation patterns.’

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He believed that this formation could trap everyone for a long period of time, including Li Changdan… because Ling Han was the only formation alchemist in the entire Ancient Dao Sect. Li Changdan definitely had not studied formations before. At the very least, he did not have much natural talent in this area.

If the other party wanted to walk out, he would have to repeatedly measure every inch of land. He would also have to have an outstanding memory in order to draw a map in his mind.

Ling Han was not in a hurry. He relied on his intuition regarding formations, and combined it with what he had currently grasped to locate the location of the formation foundations.

After coming out of the Divine Stone, his strength had to start from scratch, but he didn’t completely start from scratch. This was because he had unimaginable luck as he possessed astonishing comprehension of formations and alchemy.

After searching for a while, Ling Han finally stopped. He began to dig in the ground.

This was a competition within the same sect, so no one was allowed to carry a weapon. Ling Han could only snap off a nearby branch, and then use the branch as a shovel.

He dug three feet into the ground, but he still didn’t find what he needed.

‘Could it be that it’s not here?” Ling Han rubbed his chin. “Or could it be that I didn’t dig deep enough?

‘I’ll dig some more.’

He continued to dig. The three-feet deep burrow became five feet, but he still couldn’t find the formation foundations.

‘I’ll dig another three feet.’ Ling Han gave himself a limit.

After digging continuously and shoveling out a large amount of soil, the corners of Ling Han’s mouth couldn’t help but curl into a smile. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He finally dug it out!

Underneath the ground, there was a black pillar erected. It looked like some kind of metal, and there was a strange light flickering on its surface.

Ling Han reached out and pulled it out. Fortunately, there wasn’t much of the black pillar that was still buried in the ground, so he easily pulled it out.

However, as soon as it was pulled out, the flickering brilliance on it immediately dimmed, as if it had turned into an ordinary iron pillar.

It was about a foot long, thicker than a forearm, and square-shaped. Each side was engraved with complicated veined patterns, giving one a headache just by looking at it.

Ling Han keenly discovered that after digging out this pillar, the fog suddenly disappeared in the radius of about 90 meters.

Once the formation foundations were gone, the formation in this area would naturally lose its effectiveness.

Ling Han observed the veined patterns on the formation foundations. These were formation patterns, the core secrets of a formation.

However, no matter how much he looked, he could not grasp anything. This was because as long as he looked away, his mind would not have the image of the formation patterns at all. If he couldn’t remember them at all, how could he learn?

‘Ancient formations are indeed not easy to learn.’ Ling Han nodded.

What should he do?

Could it be that he was going to give up just like that?

Ling Han looked to his left and right, and after confirming that there was indeed no one around, he hid this black pillar into the layers of his clothing.

‘Yes, I’ll take it back and slowly study it.’

“Ling Han, I’ve finally found you!” A voice suddenly sounded from behind Ling Han.
