Xia Wuque couldn’t help but smile smugly.

He and Ling Han had both unleashed divine sense attacks, yet he had been able to insta-kill the shadow, while Ling Han had only managed to severely wound it. This showed the gap in strength between their divine senses.

Ling Han glanced at him, and a sense of scorn involuntarily formed in his mind. He hadn’t used his full strength while unleashing the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique just then, as he had wanted to gauge how strong ghostly shadows were. Thus, he naturally had to raise the power of the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique bit by bit.

In Xia Wuque’s eyes, however, this was a display of Ling Han’s “weakness”.

Ling Han didn’t want to argue with him. When their team dissolved after they left this place, he would definitely beat this person up. He would let Xia Wuque know that he had merely been embarrassing himself by bragging so shamelessly.

“What’s this?” Shao Sisi asked.

She was a beautiful woman, and thus she didn’t mind appearing a little “clueless”. After all, this wouldn’t cause the others to look down on her. On the contrary, men weren’t inclined to ask questions even if they didn’t understand something. This was especially so if one were among a group of prodigies. Who didn’t want face?

Everyone remained silent. This was because none of them knew what this was.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Perhaps this isn’t a being from the Immortal Realm.”

“What?!” the others all shouted in surprise. What could it be if it wasn’t a being from the Immortal Realm?

“Ling Han, stop trying to frighten everyone!” Xia Wuque scolded.

Ling Han couldn’t even be bothered to look at him. “If I’m not wrong, this is probably a being from the Netherworld.”

This ghostly shadow reminded him of the Asura Demon Emperor. Neither of them had a physical body, and both of them possessed the ability to attack using their divine sense. In addition, their divine sense was both weak.

It was just that this ghostly shadow didn’t appear to possess sentience anymore—it merely knew how to launch some attacks in a mechanical manner. Otherwise, if this shadow were the as powerful Asura Demon Emperor, how could it charge over to hand them its life on a silver platter?

“The Netherworld!”

A solemn expression appeared on the prodigies’ faces. They were very fortunate that the barrier between the two realms was extremely secure in this galaxy. As a result, they didn’t need to fight off any invasions from the Netherworld. They had merely heard of the Netherworld’s existence.

Meanwhile, the Venerable Trinity was someone who had returned from the Two Realm Battlefield. Even a powerful person like him hadn’t been able to exterminate the intruders from the Netherworld. From this, it could be seen just how powerful the Netherworld was.

“Brother Ling, are you sure?” Su Jing asked with a serious expression. If a being from the Netherworld had truly appeared here, this would be a tremendous problem. Although the ghostly shadow had been weak, it would be extremely likely that there were more powerful beings from the Netherworld lurking around.

This meant that there was a possibility of a Two Realm Passageway existing in their galaxy!

If that were the case, they would need to battle. They would need to engage in a battle of immense proportions!

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m only guessing as well. Moreover, even if this being is genuinely from the Netherworld, that doesn’t imply that there must be a Two Realm Passageway in our galaxy. Perhaps the owner of this tomb brought it over from some other place.”

This was extremely likely. Ling Han had witnessed the extreme narcissism of the tomb owner, who had replicated a stone statue formation after passing through a similar one in some Puppet Sect.

With that in mind, it wouldn’t be surprising if the tomb owner had killed many elites of the Netherworld in the Two Realm Battlefield and also captured some to bring over here to show off his might and greatness.

It was just that the tomb owner should have been dead for countless years already. Even if he had truly captured beings from the Netherworld and brought them over, could they really have survived for this long?

Ling Han shook his head. He couldn’t make heads nor tails of the situation; at least not now. There was no need for him to waste any more time on this.

The ghostly shadow had been a little muddleheaded, and it clearly didn’t possess any intelligence. This was evident from how it had been tailing Ling Han and the others just then. That had been an extremely childish act. Thus, they naturally wouldn’t be able to get any answers from the ghostly shadows themselves.

That being the case, they immediately launched divine sense attacks to exterminate the remaining ghostly shadows.

These beings were especially strange, and after they were killed, they transformed into mist that would eventually dissipate. They didn’t leave any corpse.

Ling Han used his divine sense to communicate with the Asura Demon Emperor and ask him questions. He was a genuine native of the Netherworld.

After listening to Ling Han’s account, the Asura Demon Emperor hurriedly replied, “According to Master’s description, I’m 90% certain that those were beings from the Netherworld. They’re called the ‘Shadow-eating Tribe’.”

“Shadow-eating Tribe?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

“That’s right, these beings feed on shadows,” the Asura Demon Emperor said. “Moreover, they can absorb someone’s life essence by swallowing their shadow. They’re formless killers. However, the ghostly shadows that Master spoke of are clearly a bit strange. It appears as if they’ve lost their sentience and awareness. They simply attached themselves to others’ shadows by instinct, and they didn’t cause any tangible damage.”

Ling Han nodded in agreement. Those shadows were most likely members of the Shadow-eating Tribe. However, their awareness had already been severed by the tomb owner, and thus they even lost their ability to feed. They were simply left with an instinctive hobby of following shadows.

“Let’s continue,” Quan Lixuan said in a haughty voice. “Who cares if those ghostly shadows are from the Netherworld or not. They’re fairly weak anyway, and we can deal with them in no time at all.”

Indeed, divine sense attacks were extremely effective and damaging toward ordinary living beings. Quan Lixuan and the others were all descendants of super-powerful forces, so it was only natural that they all possessed secret techniques to cultivate their divine sense. Thus, not only did they possess a powerful divine sense, but they also possessed the ability to launch divine sense attacks.

As such, they held no fear of the ghostly shadows that roamed this place.

They set off again, and after a short while, the shadows on the ground increased again.

They were prepared this time, so they weren’t afraid in the least. They attacked together and obliterated all of the ghostly shadows.

In fact, it wasn’t only divine sense attacks that could wound these ghostly shadows. Flames, lightning, and other attack methods could also threaten the lives of these shadows. It was just that they weren’t as effective as divine sense attacks.

Meanwhile, these ghostly shadows were least afraid of direct physical attacks. A clear example of this was the Asura Demon Emperor, who had still managed to live for 100,000 years even though he had been separated into nine pieces.

“Haha, so this level is actually this easy to pass!” After walking for a while, they arrived before a giant metal door. It was extremely likely that this signified the end of the first level.

Everyone wore a faint smile.

To ordinary Mountain River Tier cultivators, this level wouldn’t be easy to pass. This was because the ghostly shadows came and went without a sound. Moreover, apart from the descendants of super-powerful forces, how many people practiced secret techniques pertaining to divine sense attacks?

Thus, if it were some other team, this level would definitely be incredibly challenging to pass.

“Hold on!”

Only upon arriving closer did they discover that there was a gigantic Demonic Beast lying before the giant metal door. They had failed to see it before as the color of its scales was far too similar to that of the tiles on the floor.

This Demonic Beast... It was extremely difficult to describe its appearance. This was because it was lying on the floor at the moment, and this made it look like a flat piece of rug.

“Is this Demonic Beast guarding the door?”

“It looks like we have to defeat it.”

“Let’s probe its strength first.”

Shao Sisi smiled faintly, and said, “I’ll try first!”

She retrieved a set of bow and arrows. The bow was decorated with several divine patterns, and the arrows were too. This was a set of God Tools.

“So it turns out that Lady Shao is also an expert in archery!” the others praised. They were also a little fearful at the same time. Experts in archery could launch attacks from incredibly long distances, and it was mighty difficult to defend against such attacks.

“I only know a bit about archery,” Shao Sisi said modestly. She drew her bow.

Weng!

The divine patterns on the bow and arrow lit up, exuding a domineering aura.

Everyone’s heart shuddered. The might of this arrow couldn’t be underestimated. Even they would have to be especially careful if they came up against such an attack. If they were caught off guard, it was extremely likely that they would be hit by this attack.
