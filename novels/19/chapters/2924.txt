2925 Son of Destiny

Destroy the Genesis World again?

Everyone shook their head. There would probably be no one aside from the undying and indestructible Seventh Tier Seventh elites that could escape alive when the dimensions crumbled.

“That’s right. When detonating the cores of all dimensions, aside from Seventh Tiers, there is no one who would be able to survive that.” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan nodded. “Furthermore, since Extermination has fallen for it once, I’m afraid it won’t repeat the same mistake.”

After a round of conversation, everyone also found out that though these five Seventh Tiers were the strongest in their era, under the impact of the Genesis World’s destruction, they had also suffered heavy injuries, and were forced to enter into a state of slumber. They felt as if eternity had passed, and only now did they awaken and reemerge in the world.

!!

Both sides were the strongest in the world, but Hysteria had awakened before them, and it had suffered an equivalent of a burst of attack caused by the entire Genesis World exploding. With such a comparison, Hysteria’s terrifyingness was fully displayed.

It couldn’t be killed no matter what, and it was also powerful to the extreme. How could they not be afraid?

“Looks like we have to work together,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said.

“En.” Lin Luo, Bai Fan, and the other Seventh Tier elites nodded. Their interests were the same now, and even if they couldn’t defeat Hysteria with the addition of five Seventh Tier supreme elites, at least their strength would be greatly boosted, and they would be able to last for a longer time.

“Please return with us, friends,” Xin Fu said.

“All right!”

Everyone returned to the Flaming Frost Realm together. With the intervention of Seventh Tiers, their speed was naturally astonishingly great. In a few years’ time, they returned to the Flaming Frost Realm.

Chong Yan and the other supreme elites all sensed the Power of this Dimension. They weren’t from this dimension, and in fact weren’t even from this Genesis World. Thus, they needed to once again grasp the unique Power of Dimension here.

For a Seventh Tier, having one more or one less such power wouldn’t have much effect, but it was always good to strengthen oneself, even if it was only a bit.

“My five friends, shall we now go to see some old friends?” Lin Luo asked with a smile.

“Before that, we have one more thing to do,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said.

The five Seventh Tier elites moved at the same time, but there were specks of light flickering on their palms, and the whole sky was filled with them. They were both beautiful and stunning.

“Yi, the light of life!” Lin Luo and the other Seventh Tiers all exclaimed.

“It contains the mark of life, and can nurture new life.”

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan nodded, and said, “The Genesis World was destroyed, and aside from Seventh Tiers who are undying and indestructible, no other life form could possibly survive. Only the mark of life could be preserved in the mind of a Seventh Tier, and only then would there be a chance for rebirth.”

For a living being, the most important thing was memory. In other words, it was the mark of life; the body itself was actually not all that important.

Now, the Seventh Tier elites extracted the boundless power of heaven and earth to construct a new bodies for these marks of life

Life was the manifestation of Regulations. The Heavenly Venerable Tier was superior to Regulations, so creating life was naturally a small matter. However, without the mark of life, the life created by a Heavenly Venerate would also have no intelligence, and would need a long time to slowly evolve and form.

Witnessed by countless people, the power of heaven and earth gathered on the spots of light. One after another, living beings came from nothing, forming out of thin air.

There were humanoid shapes, as well as those of beasts and birds. When they took form, they were at the Celestial King Tier. There were First Heaven Celestial Kings, and there were also Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

“Heavenly Venerable Tier surpasses Regulations, but because we are too powerful, we cannot be reformed by Regulations. Hence, the light of life cannot be left behind so that we can obtain rebirth, either,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said calmly, seemingly feeling very regretful.

Everyone felt the same. If the Heavenly Venerates of the other Genesis World could be brought over, then their strength would undoubtedly increase greatly.

“Though we are all Seventh Tiers, the light of life that we can preserve is also limited,” Heavenly Venerate Half Moon said. “However, these are all the greatest prodigies of all eternity. The majority of them could have long since become Heavenly Venerates, but for the sake of preserving some chance of life, they have not broken through all this while.”

“Throughout such a long time, their souls have also been cultivating and improving. As long as they possess a real body, they would be able to experience a great breakthrough in a short period of time.”

Boom!

Just like an explanatory note for his words, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King actually advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier easily, and was instantly targeted by the heaven and earth. Lightning struck madly, yet he easily dispersed it.

This was too terrifying. To say nothing of how long he had been accumulating power at the Ninth Heaven for, this could only bring him appreciation. He did not have the slightest understanding of the Flaming Frost Realm at all.

Ling Han also looked over, and saw that this was a young man that looked like a god. He had long golden hair, exuded a soft luster, and was indescribably handsome.

And he himself was exuding a kind of power, a grand power, the power of the world, as if he was the son of destiny. Merely standing there, he had become the center of the heaven and earth, attracting everyone’s attention.

“Feng Wuding was the strongest prodigy of our world. Moreover, when the Genesis World collapsed, an inheritance mark flew out and landed on Feng Wuding’s light of life,” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said with a hint of envy.

A Seventh Tier was already standing at the pinnacle of the world, truly invincible, undying, and indestructible, yet he was actually envious of Feng Wuding, which showed how amazing this great luck was.

But when one thought about it, it made sense. Obtaining the inheritance mark of the Genesis Worldwhat kind of concept was that?

“If we want to completely eliminate Extermination, the present Hysteria, Feng Wuding is the key,” Heavenly Venerate Half Moon said. “As long as he matures, he’ll possess the great power of the Genesis World, and perhaps this can really be realized.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

When everyone looked at Feng Wuding again, their gazes had changed completely.

Envy, jealousy, hateall these emotions filled their eyes.

“At this point, let me give you a warning first,” Heavenly Venerate BIg Dipper suddenly said, his voice cold and sharp. “The inheritance mark of the Genesis World cannot be snatched. If anyone wants to kill Feng Wuding and snatch his inheritance mark, it is destined to be a pointless effort. They would be destroying the only chance to destroy Hysteria!

“And I will also crush that person’s bones into dust.”

There was no need for a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate to threaten anyone at all; who would not revere him? But Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper had still deliberately said this, which showed just how important Feng Wuding was.

Everyone nodded internally. This mark should indeed not be taken away. Otherwise, why would a Seventh Tier elite not take it for themselves?

“Friends, let’s go and meet Hysteria. We haven’t seen it for so many years, and we still ‘miss’ it quite a bit,” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said. The five of them had already completed the creation of life, and there were instantly more than 10,000 Celestial Kings here.

“Zhou Heng, make the necessary arrangements,” Lin Luo said to Zhou Heng. He paused for a moment before continuing, “Hysteria has sensed something, and is currently launching an attack. We need to return to our positions and resist with all our might.”

“Understood, Master.” Zhou Heng nodded respectfully.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The 10 Seventh Tier elites left, leaving behind those who had yet to regain their breath.

The amount of information that they had received was really too great, and they needed time to digest it.
