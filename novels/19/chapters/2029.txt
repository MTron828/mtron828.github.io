Chapter 2030: Reaching the Western Celestial Realm

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They had arrived at the Western Celestial Realm.

Ling Han immediately felt the difference of this place. Compared to the Eastern Celestial Realm, the Spiritual Qi here was far more concentrated. Because of this, the Spiritual Herbs and Celestial medicines in the Western Celestial Realm were of higher quality and more abundant than those in the Eastern Celestial Realm.

It was no wonder that the overall level of cultivation in the Western Celestial Realm was superior. Their environment was already better.

Ling Han turned to Hu Niu, and asked, “Niu, where’s the Roc Palace?”

“Huh?” Hu Niu blinked, and replied, “The Roc Palace is naturally where the Roc Palace is.”

Ling Han grimaced, and asked, “So you don’t know where your home is?”

“Niu doesn’t need to know,” Hu Niu said.

.

However, this was indeed expected. With this glutton’s personality, how could she care about her surroundings? She would be satisfied as long as she could eat and play.

‘Fine. There’s clearly a member of the Roc Palace here, yet we have absolutely no clue about where the Roc Palace is located.’

“Then we can only ask someone.”

They disembarked from the ship, and continued to journey forward. A lush forest appeared before them, and their eyes lit up upon seeing it.

Gazing at the unchanging sea had been far too boring. Now that they could see some greenery, they naturally felt completely refreshed.

“Let’s look for the nearest city. We can then ask around and find the way to the Roc Palace.”

They set off in some direction, and they were convinced that they would eventually come across a city.

Seven days later.

Rumble…

The earth suddenly started to quake, and it was as if there were an earthquake.

Ling Han looked over, only to see a wave rushing toward them.

No… this wasn’t a wave. Instead, it was an army!

They were either marching forward or in the process of fleeing. In any case, they were lightning quick, and there were mountain-like elephants charging alongside them. There were also Rocs with a wingspan of several thousand meters soaring through the sky, and there were many armored warriors wielding their spears as they danced in the air.

There were numerous elites among them, and they were all radiating with extremely terrifying auras. With so many of them together, their advance naturally caused the earth to quake. It was as if heaven and earth were about to collapse.

This was a fleeing army.

Ling Han determined this after observing them for a brief moment. After all, ordinary armies wouldn’t abandon their armor and weapons. Moreover, they wouldn’t be carrying such a large number of wounded warriors, and their morale wouldn’t be so low.

There was a flag among them, and Ling Han saw the moon-shaped symbol on this flag. This flag was being held by a golden giant that measured 30 meters in height.

The army quickly arrived before them before hurriedly soaring over their heads. Of course, there were also many warhorses that sprinted past them. In fact, several of them almost crashed into Ling Han and the others.

“You guys, hurry up and turn around,” some passing soldier said.

“Be careful not to lose your life.”

‘What do they mean?’

A thought suddenly occurred to Ling Han, and he shouted, “F*ck! They’re still being pursued!”

“Haha! Since you know, hurry up and flee,” a soldier said with a loud laugh.

Ling Han was exasperated, and he could only say, “Follow me.”

He didn’t want to use the Black Tower before so many people. Moreover, he didn’t want to rely on the Black Tower every time he came across some danger.

Ling Han and the others also turned around to flee. However, because they had reacted too slowly, they were now stuck at the very back of the fleeing army. Glancing back, they could see another “wave” surging over from the distance.

That was also a huge army, and they were carrying another flag with them. This flag was decorated with the word “Dou”.

Sure enough, one army was fleeing, while the other army was pursuing.

‘F*ck! Why do I always come across these situations?’

Ling Han sprinted as fast as he could, and the Empress and the others all followed behind him. They all felt extremely frustrated. Only Hu Niu was giggling, finding this situation extremely interesting. Meanwhile, Xiao Gu wore a naive and adorable expression. As long as there was no “enemy”, he would be in this indifferent state.

One army was fleeing, while another army was pursuing. A battle had clearly been fought just then, and the army with the moon flag had been defeated. Thus, they were fleeing. Behind them, the victorious army was relentlessly giving chase.

This pursuit lasted for a whopping 15 days, at which time the pursuing army finally stopped and gave up on the chase. The fleeing army finally managed to catch a breath, no longer needing to advance in such disarray.

During these 15 days, Ling Han also became quite familiar with these people.

This army belonged to the Moon Plucking Celestial King, and it was referred to as the Moon Plucking Army. Of course, this was only one of the many armies under the flag of the Moon Plucking Army. Meanwhile, their opponent had been the Refined Cloud Army, which belonged to the Refined Cloud Celestial King.

These two Celestial Kings controlled neighboring territories, so it wasn’t unusual for large-scale battles to break out between them.

War naturally ended with victors and losers. This time, the Moon Plucking Celestial King had suffered a small loss. Of course, neither the Moon Plucking Celestial King nor the Refined Cloud Celestial King had participated in this battle. The two armies were simply led by the generals under them.

During this time, Ling Han had also asked around for the Roc Palace’s whereabouts. However, even though these people had heard of the Roc Palace, they weren’t sure about where exactly it was located.

The Eastern Celestial Realm was large, yet the Western Celestial Realm was even larger!

The Eastern Celestial Realm possessed 33 Heavens, while the Western Celestial Realm possessed 99 Heavens. It was three times larger.

For ordinary people, it would already be extremely impressive if they had traveled to the nearby three or four Heavens before. Thus, if the Roc Palace were located six or seven Heavens away, it was indeed very difficult for these people to know where it was located.

Perhaps the Moon Plucking Celestial King would know. However, could Ling Han ask the Moon Plucking Celestial King about such trivial matters?

In fact, he wouldn’t even be able to meet the Celestial King.

Ling Han felt extremely annoyed. They had clearly arrived at the Western Celestial Realm already, yet he felt like he had become a fool. He had no clue where to go next.

“Since that’s the case, let’s follow this army first,” the Empress suggested.

This was their only option. They would settle here first, and then they would make a plan for the future.

This army was fairly friendly, and they didn’t shoo Ling Han and the others away. They allowed them to travel together.

Seven days later, the army finally arrived at their encampment. Ling Han and the others weren’t allowed to enter, so they could only separate ways here. The soldiers gave them some guidance, and after walking north for around three days, a large city eventually appeared before them.

“We don’t know where the Roc Palace is, but what about the alchemy holy land or whatnot?”

Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. He should have come to the Western Celestial Realm with Ma Tongguang 1000 years ago. However, Ma Tongguang had been killed, and he had thus lost his guide. At that time, he had also been lazy, so he hadn’t studied much about the Western Celestial Realm.

“I remember Master calling that place the Universal Peace Heaven or something.

“Although the time has long passed, as the representative of the Eastern Celestial Realm, I should still go even if I’m late.

“Fine, then our first stop will be the Universal Peace Heaven.

“Moreover, alchemists are involved in business with customers from all places, so it’s extremely likely that they know the whereabouts of the Roc Palace.

“We’ll rest for a while and then immediately set off.”

Ling Han made a decision, and the others naturally wouldn’t oppose it. They decided to rest in this city for a few days, where they would also replenish their food supply and other necessities. They would then set off for the Universal Peace Heaven.

The Western Celestial Realm had many local specialties, and Spiritual Herbs were one of these. Many Spiritual Herbs that were rare in the Eastern Celestial Realm were common goods here, and they were more so as cheap as dirt. It was no wonder that so many merchants were willing to travel tens of thousands of kilometers to this place, even if the journey was filled with perilous dangers. The potential profit was far too astonishing.

Ling Han also purchased many goods. Even though Spiritual Herbs couldn’t help with one’s comprehension, they could help one accumulate Origin Power. This was always helpful.

“Help! Help! Evil tyrants are trying to kidnap a woman!” a woman shouted in a shrill voice. She ran over from the distance, and there were a dozen or so men chasing after her. They were all wearing sinister expressions.
