2883 Part of the Truth

Ling Han didn’t think that he had to work for Hysteria just because the latter had given him a first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal. This was too foolish.

He wasn’t that stupid, and Hysteria shouldn’t be that naive, either.

‘Hang on!’

He suddenly recalled that an evil consciousness had entered his mind previously, but before it could do anything, it was obliterated by the Powers of Dimension surging in his body.

!!

Could it be that, under normal circumstances, this consciousness should have affected him, causing him to defect and become a traitor to join Hysteria’s side?

This was very likely; it very logically explained his prior conclusion.

However, there was another problem. Hysteria would never do something that it was not confident in, so how had he managed to resist this consciousness?

Hysteria’s strength had surpassed the Seventh Tier. Was its consciousness so easily obliterated?

Ling Han knew that he was very impressive. He had cultivated tens of thousands of Powers of Dimension, and he himself was equivalent to a small Genesis World. However, it was still a small Genesis World, after all. He had not even been able to defeat Xin Qihu, so what right did he have to be so strong as to obliterate Hysteria’s consciousness?

The more he realized, the more confused Ling Han became.

He had solved some of the mysteries. For example, why did Meng Dong think that he was one of his group? Why did he keep calling him “little brother”? In a sense, they were indeed the same group.

Why did Hysteria always find him so easily in the Void? It was because the spot of light in his body was like a bright light in the darkness. It was too obvious to Hysteria; these spots of light were just a part of it.

So annoying, so annoying!

Ling Han opened his eyes. He was so frustrated that he wanted to beat someone up. Then, he saw Yan Jiuling standing in front of him.

“Greetings, milord!” Yan Jiuling’s heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly cupped his fists and bowed.

Although he was grumbling mentally, because Ling Han had given him a fright, and even the Celestial Tool that he had almost forged successfully was gone… Ling Han’s strength was clearly above his. To speak of nothing else, just the might he had exuded after opening his eyes just now had almost scared him out of his wits.

It should be known that he was a Celestial King, and was already standing at the same level as the Regulations. If he was already so frightened, it could be seen how terrifying Ling Han was. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han merely glanced at him, and immediately understood the entire sequence of events. He had just not paid attention, but that didn’t mean that he didn’t know. It was merely hidden in his memories, and now that he had dug it out, he understood.

He nodded. With a flip of his hand, a piece of Divine Metal appeared.

He shaped it casually, and this piece of Divine Metal quickly turned into the shape of a sword. Then, he threw it at Yan Jiuling. “I’ll compensate for your sword.”

Yan Jiuling accepted the sword numbly. His mouth was about to split open from shock.

This was Divine Metal, the sturdiest thing in the world.

Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could indeed break the Divine Metal, but it would definitely not be as easy as how Ling Han had easily and casually shaped it like it was clay.

Such power surpassed the level of Celestial King Tier!

Yan Jiuling fell to his knees with a thud, and said respectfully, “Greetings, Senior. I am Yan Jiuling.”

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively, and said, “Go, this place is very dangerous. If you continue to stay here, I’m afraid your life will be in danger.”

“Yes.” Yan Jiuling hurriedly left with the Divine Sword in his hands. This model had already been forged. Next, he only needed to nurture it with his own martial intent, and it would become a Celestial Tool.

Ling Han stood still. He wasn’t trying to scare Yan Jiuling, but if a great battle were to break out later, a mere First Heaven Celestial King wouldn’t even be worthy of being considered cannon fodder.

A moment later, the Void split open, and a person walked out.

Meng Dong!

“Little Brother, now you know who you are, right?” he said with a smile.

Ling Han’s expression remained unchanged. He was not surprised by Meng Dong’s appearance. Meng Dong was one of Hysteria’s men, and he had “awakened” his memories. It was only natural that Meng Dong would come and recruit him.

Ling Han raised his hand. Weng, a seal lit up, suppressing heaven and earth until they paled in color. Endless lightning immediately struck toward him.

This was the first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal that he had just obtained!

It was very strange. He didn’t need to comprehend this seal; he had mastered it as soon as it appeared. It was as if he had learned it long ago, but he had forgotten and left it in some hidden corner.

When Meng Dong saw this, he immediately laughed out loud. “Little Brother, you’ve finally returned!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I have some problems with my body, and some of my memories are not very clear.”

Meng Dong nodded. “You are indeed different from the others. Once we advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, we will automatically awaken, but you had yet to awaken even after reaching the Second Tier. It was our Lord who exerted force and forcibly stimulated your dormant memories.”

‘As expected!’

Although Ling Han already had a guess, hearing Meng Dong say it himself still shook his heart. However, there was still no change in his expression. He still had this bit of self-control.

‘Our Lord?’

It seemed that Meng Dong was completely on Hysteria’s side.

Ling Han deliberately looked distressed. “My mind is a mess now. It’s filled with confusion.”

“Little Brother, you have to know that we are all a part of the Lord. In the future, we will all return to our Lord and become the rulers of the entire Genesis World!” Meng Dong’s face revealed a fanatical expression. “Little Brother, if it wasn’t for the power of our Lord in your body, how could you be so freakish and become such a powerful Heavenly Venerate? If it wasn’t for our Lord, how could you have the ability to devour life essence and transform it into your own cultivation level?

“Everything we have is bestowed by our Lord, so you must firmly believe in it, and not let your thoughts run wild.”

Ling Han’s heart stirred. Back then, he had been chosen by the Black Tower. Was it also because he had the power of Hysteria in his body?

A trace of confusion flashed in his heart. Could it be that it was all because of Hysteria that he had managed to reach this level?

Were all his efforts meaningless?

‘No!’ Ling Han immediately thought to himself. Whether it was the power of Hysteria or the Black Tower, they might indeed be of use to him on his path of growth, but the one who truly decided his fate was still himself.

Ling Han said, “What should we do now?”

“Cultivate diligently. Once we advance to the Sixth Tier, we can begin to take action.” Meng Dong revealed an intense killing intent.

Ling Han’s heart trembled. If others said that they wanted to reach the Sixth Tier, that might just be an extravagant hope. However, Meng Dong and the others all had a trace of Hysteria’s power in their bodies, so advancing to the Sixth Tier was definitely not difficult.

It had to be known that Hysteria was capable of creation in the Void, and the Sixth Tiers it created could form an army, so it was definitely not impossible to help Meng Dong and the others reach Sixth Tier.

At that time, Lin Luo and the other Seventh Tier elites would be restricted by the main body of Hysteria. Behind the front lines, hundreds of Sixth Tier elites would display their might at the same time. How could the Flaming Frost Realm manage to stop them?

...

When all the living beings in the Flaming Frost Realm died out, the power of heaven and earth would decline to the extreme, and Hysteria would be able to directly devour the Flaming Frost Realm. There would be no need to care about those Seventh Tiers at all.

Moreover, now that the Realm Battlefield had been sealed, there were no more external threats, and only internal strife remained. Just look at how many Heavenly Venerates died a while ago.

By the time Meng Dong and the others acted, how many Sixth Tiers could there be left in the Flaming Frost Realm?

The more Ling Han thought about it, the more apprehensive he became. Could it be that all of this was Hysteria’s scheme?

It sealed off the Realm Battlefield so that there were signs of peace in the world, which caused the Heavenly Venerates to start fighting among themselves, while the power Hysteria had laid in ambush was continuously growing. At that time, if it suddenly launched an attack, it could instantly destroy the Flaming Frost Realm.

“Hehe, when can I meet my other brothers and sisters?” Ling Han asked. If he could grasp the identities of all these people, then he could ask Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and the others to take action and quell this chaos in advance.

Meng Dong laughed. “Little Brother, don’t be anxious. When the time comes, I’ll naturally let you meet everyone.”

F*ck, this guy was quite vigilant, and still refused to trust Ling Han fully.

Ling Han didn’t say anything else. As the saying went, haste makes waste. He couldn’t alert the enemy.
