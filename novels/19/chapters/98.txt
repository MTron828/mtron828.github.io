Chapter 99: Thrash as Usual

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Qi Yong Ye and the others looked absolutely furious at this.

Asking him to kneel down and lick another’s shoes, what kind of great humiliation was that? If this Wei He Le was in Gushing Spring Tier, or a Black Grade alchemist, then perhaps he would be qualified to make such unreasonable demands. But he was only a Yellow Grade low level alchemist, a martial artist at the mere level of first layer of Element Gathering Tier; how did he get the confidence to talk so big?

The people who were born in the imperial city truly acted like they were superior to anyone and everyone else.

“You’ve gone too far!” Jin Wuji shouted immediately, “Wei He Le, you’re only a mere Yellow Grade low level alchemist now, don’t you think you’re talking too big?”

“You dare to go against me?” Wei He Le smiled coldly, looking extremely confident in himself.

Indeed, he was only a Yellow Grade low level alchemist now, but his future prospects were limitless. Otherwise, why would Feng Luo go out of his way to deliberately befriend him? Of course, the reason why he had befriended Feng Luo was also because of Feng Yan. If not for Feng Yan, how would he have taken a mere martial artist of Element Gathering Tier seriously?

He possessed remarkable potential in the path of alchemy, while Feng Yan could possibly become a ruler in the field of martial arts. In this world, the strongest ruled after all. No matter how awesome an alchemist grew to be, he would still need the help of a powerful warrior proficient in martial arts.

Jin Wuji instantly felt the urge to hit someone. Wei He Le was only in the first layer of Element Gathering Tier, and from the looks of it, he had only managed to climb to this cultivation level with the help of alchemical pills. Jin Wuji would be able to easily dominate him with one hand behind his back. Furthermore, his status as a mere Yellow Grade low level alchemist did not worry him at all, as there was no way that there would come a day that Jin Wuji would make any requests of an alchemist of this lowly rank.

The problem was that there was a high chance that Wei He Le may be taken in as disciple by Wu Song Lin, and Wu Song Lin was a Black Grade high level alchemist! Previously, they had all done Ling Han a favor by throwing their respective matches in Da Yuan City because there stood two Black Grade low level alchemists behind him; however, Wu Song Lin was a much grander figure then those two, so the pressure they felt was obvious.

Jin Wuji’s expression turned dark and cold, yet he did not open his mouth to speak.

“What right do you have to be so arrogant!” Baili Teng Yun was in the prime of his youth, and so was easily moved by his emotions. He was also aware that he was a citizen of Da Yuan City, so even if this Wei He Le would one day become a Black Grade alchemist, it would not affect him whatsoever. As a result, he naturally held no fear of offending Wei He Le.

Wei He Le could not help showing displeasure at this, and said, “Are you challenging me?”

“So what if I am? Do you dare to battle with me?” Baili Teng Yun said arrogantly.

“Young Master Wei!” It was at this moment that another three young men joined them. These three newcomers all had a powerful aura radiating from them; they had all reached the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier.

“So it’s you guys,” Wei He Le spared a glance at them, and a faint, perfunctory smile appeared on his face.

“Young Master Wei, have you encountered some kind of trouble?” One of them said with a smile. The speaker was dressed in green battle robes, and was quite tall.

Wei He Le revealed a disdainful smile, pointed at Baili Teng Yun, and said, “This guy says he wants to challenge me.”

“Hahahaha, where did this idiot come from, to actually dare to challenge Young Master Wei?” The green-clad man laughed loudly. He crooked a finger in Baili Teng Yun’s direction, and said, “Come, come, come. I shall be your opponent.”

How could Baili Teng Yun not react to such provocation? He was just about to agree when Qi Yong Ye held him back and said, “Wen Hai Xing, when did you become so immature? An elite ranked among the top hundred actually intends to bully a junior that had just barely enrolled in the Academy!”

“So it’s the King of Eternal Night!” The green-clad man behaved as if he had just noticed Qi Yong Ye—he raised his clasped hands in the latter’s direction, and said, “No wonder you dare to oppose Young Master Wei. The Fourth Prince of Da Yuan City is indeed domineering!”

His words appeared to be praising Qi Yong Ye, but in reality, they were an attempt to direct aggression to the latter.

Wei He Le’s expression immediately darkened, and he said, “So you are a noble. No wonder you are so arrogant!” Since he was a child, he had already displayed outstanding talent in the field of alchemy. Everyone in his age range tried to curry his favor in order to form an amicable relationship with the great alchemist-to-be he was. Wen Hai Xing’s words naturally caused him to feel very displeased about Qi Yong Ye’s actions.

“Ling Han, are you going to kneel or not?” Feng Luo interrupted. The person he hated the most was naturally Ling Han, and Qi Yong Ye was the Fourth Prince of Da Yuan City, and was highly likely to inherit the position of Da Yuan King in the future, so naturally Feng Luo was not willing to offend him.

“So this is the younger brother of Elder Brother Disciple Feng Yan,” when Wen Hai Xing and his companions found out Feng Luo’s identity, they all smiled immediately. Though they themselves looked down upon Feng Luo, they dared not show any disdain towards him in public. Feng Yan was too strong, and according to rumors, had the ability to challenge and join the ranks of the Core Disciples.

One of them immediately looked towards Ling Han, and said, “Brat, I, Shen Yu Xuan, am just going to say this now. If you are unable to make Younger Brother Disciple Feng Luo satisfied, then you will only be sent back to the Academy on a stretcher!”

“I, Mi Zhong Guang, am the same!” The third person said.

Feng Luo was extremely proud. He laughed loudly, and said, “Ling Han, do you still dare to be so unreasonable with me?! Who do you think you are, to dare to put on airs in front of me? You’ve humiliated me repeatedly. Who do you think I am? One single finger of mine is more precious than the whole you by ten thousandfold!”

Wei He Le and the others smiled coldly. A mere foreign new student would naturally not be taken seriously by them. The only people they would have misgivings about going against were only the direct heirs of the Eight Great Clans.

Outside the entrance, the four guards of the Spiritual Treasures Pavilion looked on with indifference. As long as no one was making trouble in the Spiritual Treasures Pavilion, then even if the sky collapsed, they would not interfere.

“Kneel!” Feng Luo roared loudly.

“Kneel your sister!” Ling Han reached out with his hand, which sped towards Feng Luo.

“How dare you!” Wen Hai Xing, Mi Zhong Guang, and Shen Yu Xuan all acted at the same time. They were all in the ninth layer of Element Gathering Tier, and were extremely strong. None of them was inferior to Qi Yong Ye. The simultaneous movement of all three was terrifyingly powerful.

“Get out of my way!” Ling Han, using the Exiting Cloud Steps, actually managed to squeeze past the restraining movements of all three of them.

Wen Hai XIng and the others were all shocked. They’d noticed that Ling Han was only in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tear, and so completely did not take him seriously. Who would have thought that Ling Han was actually so fast and had such a weird way of moving?

As a result, they had not used their full power, allowing Ling Han to easily break through their siege.

Ling Han had already appeared in front of Feng Luo, and his extended hand was already reaching towards the latter.

“You dare!” Wei He Le slanted his body to one side to stand in front of Feng Luo. He was well aware that he was a Yellow Grade low level alchemist, and was possibly the future disciple of the Headmaster of the Alchemy Department. So no matter how bold Ling Han was, he knew that Ling Han would not dare to touch a single hair on his head.

“Pa!”

However, his thoughts had just barely formed when a forceful slap from Ling Han smacked him out of the way.

Damn, this guy really dared to hit him?

Another slap from Ling Han caused Feng Luo to fall to the ground. Without waiting for him to get up, one of Ling Han’s feet stepped very firmly on Feng Luo’s face.

“Bastard, you actually dare to step on me? You are definitely tired of living, my brother will definitely kill you! Definitely!” Feng Luo wailed terribly while continuing to threaten Ling Han.

Indeed, only a profligate, spoiled young master like him dared to issue such threats in public. What kind of place was the imperial city? Here, murder was a heavily punished crime.

At the side, Wei He Le’s face was also filled with fury. He had actually been slapped away by someone? This was too insolent, too detestable! He will definitely not spare this reckless fool!

“Yi, Younger Brother Disciple Wei?” It was at this moment that a young man and woman walked over. When the maiden clearly saw Wei He Le’s face, she revealed a surprised expression.

“Elder Sister Disciple Li!” Wei He Le hurriedly got to his feet. His hands remained lowered at his sides, looking extremely respectful.

This young maiden was Li Si Chan.

In front of others, Wei He Le could put on an extremely arrogant attitude, but in front of Li Si Chan, he could only obediently withdraw all his prideful obnoxiousness, because Li Si Chan’s talent in alchemy was far above his own.

Wu Song Lin favored only his talent, but Li Si Chan was truly his most favorite disciple. Even if he really did become Wu Song Lin’s disciple, he’d still have to treat Li Si Chan with utmost respect.
