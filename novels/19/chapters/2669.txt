2670 Who is the prey?

“Hahaha!” Qin Shuang burst out into laughter. By now, his figure was tall and erect, sturdy, and golden all over. “Everyone thought that I, Qin Shuang, hid myself in the martial academy, placing myself in the service of He Yufeng because I was being hunted. Hehe, this is indeed one of the reasons, but the primary reason… is for me to cultivate this ‘Divine Feather Holy Metal Technique.’

“And now, I have already reached Small Accomplishment level, so let me test my might on you, brat!”

Bouncing off his feet, peng, his whole person immediately shot out, his speed exceedingly high.

‘Huh!’

Ling Han was surprised. This burst of power from Qin Shuang had not used the Regulations of Space, with him speeding up as he traversed through different space. Instead, it was that the speed of his physical body was too high.

The degree of speed that cultivators could use was determined by two factors. Firstly, extreme speed, and secondly, the tolerance level of the physical body. That was because the physical body would sustain a terrifying amount of pressure in high-speed movement, and even a Celestial King could possibly be torn apart by this kind of pressure.

Hence, for most Celestial Kings, their actual speed was far from reaching extreme speed.

But just now, Qin Shuang’s speed had definitely surpassed extreme speed, or rather, it had surpassed the extreme speed that he had previously maintained.

And that was because he had transformed his body into metal, so his physique became extremely tough.

This speed was too high. When Ling Han reacted, Qin Shuang had already pounced right in front of him, sweeping out with his blade.

Ling Han could just barely raise the Divine Demon Sword to parry this strike. Weng! The Celestial Tools clashed, creating a terrifying shock wave. Peng, peng, peng! Havoc was wreaked in space again, destroying the Regulations in this space.

Qin Shuang shouted loudly, and sent out another palm strike, aiming right for Ling Han’s chest.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, taking this strike head-on.

Clang!

The attack landed, and Ling Han was instantly sent flying, whereas Qin Shuang erupted into laughter. He grabbed over new Regulations from a different space for another switch.

Ling Han was sent flying backwards, directly crashing into the borders of this great formation before being forcefully stopped. Seals were flickering on his chest, and they dimmed only after a long period of time. He felt a slight boiling sensation in his chest and an itch in his throat. He wanted to spit out a mouthful of blood.

He had already channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, yet he was actually still beaten to the point that he was almost throwing up blood?

The might of this attack was truly shocking.

“This is a technique that was created by a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” Qin Shuang laughed loudly. “When I fled into the martial academy, and pled for the protection of He Yufeng, it was because I had killed the only son of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and was just waiting for things to blow over. Additionally, I would have time to cultivate this precious Heavenly Venerate Technique!”

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder the other party could breach the defenses of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll with a single strike; it was because this was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate Technique.

But because it included the word “Pseudo,” it naturally could not compare with a real Heavenly Venerate Technique. Thus, it had only caused enough impact to induce a boiling sensation in Ling Han’s chest, and had not really injured his internal organs.

This guy was really outrageously bold; he dared to kill even the only son of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han scratched his head. To think he was talking about someone else. Wasn’t he himself that kind of person as well? Moreover, if he killed anyone, he would definitely not submit to someone else and become a servant.

“I have indeed overestimated you. You are nothing but a lackey!” Ling Han’s expression was filled with disdain.

Qin Shuang was enraged. He had cultivated a precious Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate Technique, and was a peak-stage Ninth Heaven monarch star, invincible in the Celestial King Tier, yet a puny Seventh Heaven Celestial King actually dared to mock him like this?

“Die!” Qin Shuang charged out once more.

Ling Han chuckled. This time, he made absolutely no attempt to dodge or evade. Just when Qin Shuang came close enough, xiu, a black shadow suddenly shot out of Ling Han’s chest, going forth to meet Qin Shuang.

Clang!

In an exchange of blows, Qin Shuang was instantly sent flying outwards.

“Ayiyahu!” The black shadow took the form of a large dog. Who else could it be but the damn large black dog?

“You want to kill Grandpa Dog’s human pet, but have you asked Grandpa Dog for permission first?” The large black dog stood on his hindlegs, going into the posture of preparing to throw a punch. Light glinted on his iron underwear, and accompanied by his perverse expression, he looked extraordinarily despicable.

Ling Han couldn’t help but shoot out his foot in a kick. “Damn dog, whom are you calling a human pet?”

“You are actually in the martial academy?” Qin Shuang was stunned. He had investigated Ling Han’s information in close detail, and knew that he was friends with the large black dog, but the large black dog was clearly not in the martial academy, so how could he suddenly appear?

“Grandpa Dog is supremely clever, and knew that someone was scheming against my underling, so Grandpa Dog came back to destroy this couple of trash,” the large black dog answered as he crossed his paws behind him, expressing how clever he was, and how everything was under his control.

Ling Han wanted to kick him again. It was clear that this damn dog had failed in robbing a Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier precious formation, and that was why he had fled back to the martial academy.

Ling Han had initially planned to show up for the appointment alone. In any case, it would not be difficult for one of his strength to leave. However, the large black dog had volunteered himself, so Ling Han brought him along.

Qin Shuang frowned, but immediately looked confident again. “So what if there is another one of you? I only have to expend a little more effort.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He charged out once more, sweeping out his blade in another slash, and appearing extremely confident in himself.

“In front of Grandpa Dog, trash like you thinks you can be arrogant?” The large black dog shot out a paw and struck, taking the Celestial Tool head-on.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

When one had reached the height of the Ninth Heaven, he would be equal with Regulations, and a Celestial Tool only represented the strongest destructive power at the level of Regulations. Thus, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had completely no need to fear a Celestial Tool. With Regulations entwined around them, taking a Celestial Tool head-on was only a small matter.

The two great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings exchanged blows. It could be seen that the large black dog very soon got the upper hand.

In his last life, he had followed the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and cultivated a supreme cultivation technique. However, limited by his aptitude, he could not cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and was also unable to take that last step. However, after the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable died, he used a secret technique, discarding his last life of his own volition, and nurtured a new life in his old body. This process really was fraught with fatal danger.

The black dog had successfully begun his second life. This was different from Ji Wuming. He had not reincarnated, but had rather been reborn on the foundations of his old body. The difficulty of this was even greater, but the range of qualitative change would also be greater.

For the present large black dog, his Evolution Index should have directly spiked to 12, and there was an extremely great chance that he would be able to push open the doors to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

The large black dog howled. It was not enough that he had the upper hand now; he was still continuously spouting insults. That was how extremely mean he was.

If Ling Han’s skill at insults could only be considered the introductory level, the large black dog had really reached the level of great accomplishment.

Qin Shuang’s gloominess could be imagined. Not only did he have to be thrashed physically by the large black dog, havoc was also wreaked within his spirit as well. This caused the pressure on him to be as heavy as a mountain. They had not been fighting for very long before he lost all his fighting spirit.

Qin Shuang decided to flee. Otherwise, it was possible that he would die from his own fury right here.

He had hold of the core of the formation. With a single thought, the great formation would be immediately removed.

Xiu! His figure moved, and was just about to flee.

“I was just waiting for you!” Ling Han smirked coldly. Peng! He pushed off strongly with his feet, his Body Art completely activated as he shot towards Qin Shuang as rapidly as a shooting star, slashing out with the Divine Demon Sword.

Qin Shuang was completely focused on breaking free, so he had no wish to drag things out with Ling Han. He pushed out a palm to strike Ling Han, wanting to send the latter backwards. He did not dare to use his full power, or it was possible that he would not be able to burst out with full speed when the large black dog caught up to him. That would be terrible.

Yet, when the Divine Demon Sword sliced towards him, Qin Shuang suddenly realized that there was something off. Ling Han’s strike was actually more than 100 times stronger than it had been before!

How was this possible?

Qin Shuang’s expression changed drastically, but it was already too late for him to switch to another move or increase the power of his strike. Shua! The sword swept past, and one of his arms was instantly severed, and the course of the sword did not stop. It continued to sweep past the left side of his ribs, leaving behind a deep wound.
