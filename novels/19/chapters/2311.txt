Chapter 2312 Origin

Wally might not be a martial arts elite, but in terms of mathematical skill, there was probably no one that could compare to him.

According to Wally, any Regulations could be enacted, expressed, and understood through various matrixes. He also mentioned things like formulas, mathematical equations, and others, and had written who knew how many pages. Ling Han was completely mystified. “Speak in a way I can understand!” Ling Han really could not take it any more.

“Your knowledge of Regulations and the essence of the high-level dimension is too backwards.” Wally shook his head. “High-level dimensions have already developed a systematic understanding of the essence of Origin Realms, and the formula I demonstrated to you is the key to unlocking this essence. “The reason why I was designed and created was to explore the essence of the Origin Realm. Hence, after I was created, my realm has paid an innumerable price to send me to a high-level dimension, and absorb the knowledge there.” Wally revealed an astonishing truth.

Ling Han was stunned. “You guys actually have the ability to send people of your realm to a higher-level dimension?”

It should be known that if Ling Han had not obtained the Origin Magic Cube, there would’ve been absolutely no way that he could enter into the Foreign Realm. That was because he could not have cultivated the Regulations of the Foreign Realm without it. The moment he had entered that way, he would’ve been targeted by the heaven and earth, and once the Regulations locked in his body had been completely exhausted, his strength would only have been limited to the Genesis Tier. That would’ve only spelled death for him.

The Dark Inverse Realm was also a low-level dimension, yet they actually had the ability to send someone into a high-level dimension. How could this not be shocking? “Only me.” Wally pointed at himself. “I am an artificial intelligence model. Though I have retained my battle module, it is not my primary function. I have not cultivated your so-called Regulations. Theoretically speaking, I am no different than a piece of metal or wood. Hence, even if I entered into a high-level dimension, I would not be detected.”

He couldn’t have imagined that this guy also had the potential to be a spy.

“After I learned enough knowledge in the high-level dimension, I returned to my realm as instructed.

“Through a long period of calculation and deduction, I absorbed all the theoretical knowledge of the high-level dimension, and next was entering into the practical experimentation stage. “The power of heaven and earth is superior to Regulations. In high-level dimensions, elites would be directly extracting the power of heaven and earth, but ordinary people cannot do so, and it needs to be mined. Furthermore, the power of heaven and earth is located in the Core of the Realm, so it is extremely difficult to mine. Moreover, if it was done rashly without mature experience and technique, it would bring great disaster to my realm.

“Hence, a powerful king and I arrived here, preparing to execute a top-secret mission…”

When he spoke of this, he couldn’t help but stop abruptly. That was because damage had appeared in this part of his memory, and he could not continue further.

Wally’s manner was incredibly meticulous. He had to calculate and deduce, and only after it had exceeded a certain percentage would he think that an action was viable or close to the truth.

And the ability of making associative connections was pitifully poor for him. Perhaps it was just like he had said. It had not been very long since he had developed self-consciousness. After a few more epochs, he might be able to make an associative connection, but all this would still have to be based on ironclad facts.

Ling Han very easily thought of it. What Wally and that king wanted to do was to enter into the Realm Core of the Foreign Realm, and extract the power of heaven and earth there. If they had succeeded, they could’ve returned to the Dark Inverse Realm and continued. In that case, the Dark Inverse Realm might’ve been able to successfully leap to possess the battle prowess of a medium-level dimension. Worse come to worst, they would still have been able to become one of the strongest low-level dimensions.

If they had failed, the damage caused would only have been done to the Foreign Realm, and would not have affected the Dark Inverse Realm.

This was Ling Han’s deduction, and was practically based completely on assumptions as well. Furthermore, he thought that he was practically 100% correct. However, there was absolutely no way that Wally would agree with him.

“Can you extract the power of heaven and earth?” Ling Han thought of this, and couldn’t help but inhale sharply.

Right. Wally had mentioned some Void Particle Energy, and said it was one of the Source Powers of an Origin Realm. If he had not gone to a high-level dimension, how could he have had this kind of knowledge?

Wally nodded. “Yes, this is a very complicated process of energy conversion…” He explained endlessly. This would not endanger his existence, and Ling Han was owing him payment, so he held nothing back.

With a thought, Ling Han took out the Origin Magic Cube, and asked, “Do you know what this is?”

Wally’s eyes lit up, and his figure began to flicker. Ling Han knew that this was an expression of excitement from him.

“This is the Core born when the heaven and earth first developed, and contains the power of ‘Origin,” he said.

“What is Origin?” Ling Han asked.

“When the heaven and earth first began, various Source Powers would develop extremely intensely, and become more and more complex, so you would not be able to easily penetrate directly into the essence,” Wally explained. “Just like a grain of rice hiding in a granary, you would not be able to find it at all.

“If the layers of energy wrapped around it could be decoded, our formula would become simpler, and the model would become more well-developed. We would be able to better grasp the power of heaven and earth… no, according to my calculations, this would be qualitative progress.

“But when a realm comes into being, there will be strong power protecting it, and there is no way to obtain its Core at all.”

Wally’s eyes were glowing, and the light in his eyes was not dimming at all. “Give this Core to me, and there is a chance that I can decipher the secret of the essence of heaven and earth.”

Ling Han only thought that the Dark Inverse Realm was really awesome that they could actually create such a terrifying thing.

Hold on. At least 35 epochs had passed since Wally was “born.” How could it be that the Dark Inverse Realm could not create a second Wally?

“They can’t!” Wally’s sensitivity to the slight changes in expression and flicker in emotion of others was practically on the level of a monster. He immediately sensed what Ling Han was thinking. “In the first place, I was created through all efforts and resources of our realm. Going by my deduction, our realm would need at least 300 epochs to be able to produce enough materials to create a second

me.”

He thought for a while. “Of course, this would not be the same me—I am unique.”

Ling Han wanted to laugh. At times, this guy was frighteningly meticulous in thinking, but at others, he would be like a child.

It was indeed as Wally had said. It had not been long since he had developed self-consciousness, and was presently still in the process of “maturing.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I can’t give this to you for now. I need it too.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wally’s eyes shone brightly, and stared at the Origin Magic Cube for a long time. Then, he said, “This is the Core of a false realm. The power of ‘Origin’ contained within is very, very limited. Furthermore, this power is presently dissipating and evolving, becoming more complicated. It will become more and more similar with the matured power of heaven and earth.

“Then, it will be completely worthless,” he finally concluded. Was this guy bluffing to scare him? Ling Han thought. However, Wally had never had any previous history of lying so far, and it seemed like he had not learned this skill, either. Ling Han pondered for a while, and then asked, “How much longer?”

“About 200,000,000 years,” Wally estimated. “Without further analysis, I can only come up with such a vague number.”

Ling Han was immediately relieved. The Origin Magic Cube would only lose effect in another 200,000,000 years. There was still a lot of time.

He patted a hand on Wally’s shoulder, and said, “Don’t worry. I will give this to you before it loses its value.”

Wally nodded. “The sooner, the better. Otherwise, the power of Origin would only become more and more complex and encrypt itself heavily. The difficulty level for my decoding would also become higher and higher.”
