2658 Something big has happened

“What’s the big deal?” the black donkey nonchalantly asked.

“Yo, Little Han, how come you are back?” The large black dog also ran out. When he saw Ling Han, he couldn’t help but gaze at him in round-eyed wonder. This was absolutely unimaginable. A person who had entered the Celestial King Graveyard could actually break out on his own?

“Let’s find a secluded place to talk,” Ling Han said.

The black donkey stood up, and suddenly the man, dog, and donkey disappeared with a movement of the latter’s hooves.

Those prodigies who had broken out were all confused indeed. What was the problem with this person?

“Who is this person?”

“I don’t recognize him.”

“His name is Ling Han!” a young man suddenly spoke up, a smile on his face.

Yan Xianlu!

At that time, there had been no news since Ling Han battled Heavenborn. Most people said that he was already dead. Although Yan Xianlu did not believe that Ling Han would die so easily, the latter had not appeared for so many years—this caused Yan Xianlu to feel doubts as well.

But just now, he finally saw Ling Han.

“Who is this Ling Han?” someone asked.

“Now that’s a long story.” Yan Xianlu laughed.

***

Ling Han, the black donkey, and the large black dog appeared on top of a mountain. The black donkey asked impatiently, “Brat, did the sky collapse, or has the ground submerged?”

Ling Han recounted what had happened in the Ancient Tomb, and the black donkey’s face had a shocked expression.

“Oh my goodness, this is really a big deal!” The black donkey was alarmed. “I can’t handle this matter! I will look for Zhou Heng immediately to let him handle this. Otherwise, even if one or two manage to break out, it will cause huge trouble.

“Moreover, originally the establishment of the Celestial King Graveyard was in consideration of the various Heavenly Venerates. Now if all the Celestial Kings in there are to be killed, there will definitely be opposition coming from many Heavenly Venerates—it would be difficult to settle this matter satisfactorily.

“Damn, how could that bastard, Hysteria, pull off such a dirty trick?”

The black donkey jumped around, looking extremely irritated.

Killing a group of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be difficult. The difficulty was that many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings came from powerful backgrounds. Furthermore, now was the time to stand united in the fight against Hysteria. If this event caused discord among the people, then it would affect the entire situation.

“Never mind, I will go deliver the news first.” The black donkey tore a rip into space, and immediately left.

Ling Han and the large black dog looked at each other. Although they hadn’t seen each other for almost 100,000,000 years, both hadn’t changed at all.

“Damned dog, how is the Divine Metal coming along?” Ling Han asked.

They still had another task, which was to suppress Heavenborn and substitute his soul with that of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. However, the physique of Heavenborn was comparable to Divine Metal. In order to be able to strike him, the Divine Demon Sword had to be upgraded to the level of a Heavenly Venerate Tool before it could be a threat to Heavenborn.

“Che, do you think the Divine Metal can just be found anywhere?” the large black dog said irritably, but still took out seven pieces of Divine Metal.

Ling Han was astounded. “Where did you swindle all that from?”

Having gotten seven pieces of Divine Metal in just 100,000,000 years, even if it was done in the Flaming Frost Realm, wasn’t an easy feat.

“Shoo, shoo, shoo. Can’t you talk properly?” The large black dog waved a paw. “Quickly, let’s see if you can upgrade the Divine Demon Sword with these?”

Ling Han nodded. He took out the Divine Demon Sword, and it began to devour the Divine Metal.

Divine Metal was tough and durable. Any Ninth Heaven Celestial King could forge and cut it, but it could never be destroyed. However, when faced with Devouring Metal, the Divine Metal would become extremely fragile, with all its essence being quickly extracted and turning to dust.

Ling Han waved the Divine Demon Sword, and carefully examined it before saying, “It’s still lacking. I gather it still needs about three, five or 10 pieces of Divine Metal.”

“F*ck!” The large black dog bared his teeth. “Why do you still need so much, do you want me to die?”

Ling Han just smiled and stared intently at the large black dog.

“Alright. I’ll just go and get some more, okay?” The large black dog turned and left. Actually, he was even more looking forward to the resurrection of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable than Ling Han himself. After all, Ling Han had never met the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, but the large black dog had been cultivating by the side of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and their relationship ran extremely deep.

Ling Han returned to his quarters. After so many years, he had accumulated countless cultivation resources.

The Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou also came out of Celestial Guest Residence, and handed over all their cultivation resources to Ling Han for him to deal with them accordingly.

Ling Han planned to concoct alchemical pills. Relying solely on the amount supplied by the martial academy, the cultivation resources which he could obtain were still limited. After all, he wanted to upgrade the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, which required an inordinate amount of resources. If he were to depend on the supply from the martial academy, then it might take him one epoch before he could attain this goal.

He was recuperating from his injuries while cultivating and concocting the pills at the same time. As for the events of Ancient Tomb, he no longer needed to worry about it. If even Zhou Heng couldn’t handle this matter, then what could Ling Han, a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, do about it?

Several years later, his severed finger regenerated without the slightest lingering aftereffect.

And a few years later, there was news that the Celestial King Graveyard had been destroyed, and only a few people managed to come out alive.

This was indeed very shocking. It attracted the attention of countless people, and infuriated many major forces.

It was actually due to the Ascending Dragon Pill that many Celestial Kings, such as the Azure Ghost Celestial King, had been sent into the Celestial King Graveyard. However, now that these people had died here, naturally there wouldn’t be any more Ascending Dragon Pills.

While the major forces were infuriated by this news, they were also investigating the truth of the matter.

When Ling Han got to know about it, he was sure that certain forces would put the blame on him as it was his report which led to the destruction of the Celestial King Graveyard.

Of course, this had nothing to do with Ling Han. If it weren’t for him bringing back news on the emergence of so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, there would be no telling of the extent of damage that would have resulted—this was actually a great merit. However, those major forces would not think like this, for they only knew that their own interests had been jeopardized, and the direct cause of it was Ling Han.

“If they want to blame me, so be it. If I attain Great Accomplishment in my cultivation level, whom shall I fear?

“Whoever dares to come and cause trouble, I’ll kill them immediately. They dared to do such a deranged thing, each of them deserved to be killed!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ling Han swiftly put this matter aside, and concentrated on his cultivation and concocting alchemical pills.

It took him 1,000 years to absorb a single Void Particle, which he subsequently used to refine his body in order to achieve advancement in his Body Art, while his physical body had to undergo a complete destruction first. This way of improving one’s strength was extremely arduous but incomparably effective. Under such rigorous tempering, he actually succeeded in the complete cultivation of the seventh level of Indestructible Celestial King Physique.

Ling Han made persistent efforts, and his strength steadily improved. On the other hand, he also concocted plenty of alchemical pills, and planned to find an opportunity to trade them for some natural treasures.

30,000 years later, he came out of seclusion.

As soon as he came out, the Rain Emperor, Yan Xianlu, and Yi came over one after another, and talked to him about the old times. Thinking back, they had not seen each other for almost 100,000,000 years.

The Rain Emperor’s cultivation speed was still as fast as before, with him having already reached the height of the Fifth Heaven, while Yan Xianlu and Yi were slightly worse off, having only reached the level of Third Heaven. This couldn’t be compared to Ling Han, but no matter which realm he was placed in, his speed was considered to be amazing.

“Ling Han, my master has a message for you, so quickly come out on your knees and listen to it!” A voice suddenly rang out.

“Who is so arrogant?” Yan Xianlu immediately stood up.

Yi’s eyes flashed, and he said, “That seems to be Heavenborn’s lackey, Zhu Hongxuan.”

Heavenborn!

Ling Han’s and the Rain Emperor’s eyes lit up, revealing a raging fighting spirit.

“I’m going to send him away.” Yi stood up as well and walked towards the door. Heavenborn just sent a mere subordinate, so they couldn’t let Ling Han face him, or wouldn’t that be demeaning him?
