Chapter 1225: Refining the Explosive Thunder Pill

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Crawl out of this street!

Everyone’s expression changed. This wager had gone way too far.

Although the Treasure Forest Pavilion had been picking on the Han Lin Pavilion, they had only targeted the pavilion, not specific individuals. It was simply a competition for business. If the Han Lin Pavilion couldn’t win, that was completely their own fault.

However, He Jingyun was clearly intending to humiliate Ling Han with this wager!

If Ling Han truly crawled out of this street, how could he still show his face in the future? He would definitely have to flee from this city with his tail between his legs. He wouldn’t dare set foot in this city ever again.

Ling Han’s expression became cold. He could accept competition between businesses, yet He Jingyun was clearly targeting him with malicious intent.

‘Humph, you’re seeking death!

‘Are you sure you want to compete against the Alchemy Emperor?’

“Deal!” Ling Han said.

‘You’ve asked for this yourself!’

“We’re refining Level Six Divine Pills!” He Jingyun stressed. Judging by Ling Han’s Qi and blood, he probably had yet to reach 1,000 years old. Thus, he could have only been a Level Six alchemist for a maximum of 1,000 years.

With a mere 1,000 years of experience, how many cauldrons of Level Six Divine Pills could he have refined? How much understanding of Level Six Divine Pills could he have?

However, little did he know that Ling Han was an Alchemy Emperor. Moreover, he possessed a Reincarnation Tree that allowed him to complete one years’ worth of comprehension in one day!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Of course! Seeing as you’re a junior, I’ll choose my pill first. I’m refining the Explosive Thunder Pill.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In reality, this was the only Level Six Divine Pill he could refine. Thus, he would have chosen it regardless of whether he picked first or second. That being the case, why not flex a bit?

Sure enough, his flex impressed many people.

They had already said that there was a big difference between choosing first and choosing second. The person who chose second would enjoy the advantage of knowing their opponent’s choice and being able to choose accordingly.

“Explosive Thunder Pill!” He Jingyun exclaimed in slight surprise. Among Level Six Divine Pills, this pill was extremely difficult to refine. Moreover, it was an ancient pill that few people knew the recipe of.

Coincidentally, he was one of those few people.

“Heh, then I’ll also choose the Explosive Thunder Pill!” He Jingyun said confidently.

He chuckled coldly in his mind. His opponent definitely didn’t know that he had spent a significant amount of time and effort studying the Explosive Thunder Pill. Few people knew how to refine this pill, yet its effects were extraordinary—it could elevate the battle prowess of elites at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier by two stars. Thus, it was incredibly rare and expensive.

He would refine a cauldron of Explosive Thunder Pills every once in a while, so he was already able to achieve a success rate of 100%. Moreover, the quality of his pills had steadily improved over time.

‘You’re choosing to refine the Explosive Thunder Pill?

‘You’re digging a hole for yourself!’

“Okay, we’ll begin after preparing the ingredients!” Alchemist Hu announced.

Both parties started to prepare their ingredients. However, the members of the Han Lin Pavilion all wore troubled expressions. They didn’t have any Level Six alchemists, so they naturally hadn’t prepared any Level Six ingredients.

Ling Han smiled and retrieved the ingredients from his Black Tower. Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan were both moved and confused.

Why was Ling Han helping the Han Lin Pavilion?

However, they couldn’t push this powerful helper out the door at this moment, regardless of how confused they were.

After preparing their ingredients, they both said “start” together, marking the beginning of their match.

Ling Han’s actions seemed especially casual. He had already refined several cauldrons of Explosive Thunder Pills, and he would more so analyze his experiences and make improvements under the Reincarnation Tree after each session of refinement.

With his identity as the Alchemy Emperor and with the help of the Reincarnation Tree, his skills in refining the Explosive Thunder Pill would improve in leaps and bounds each time he reflected and completed comprehension.

Now, he could already refine the Explosive Thunder Pill with extreme ease.

On the other hand, He Jingyun’s actions were extremely cautious and careful. He didn’t dare let his attention waver. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, and he appeared as tense as could be.

The stark contrast between them clearly revealed who was superior.

“Unless he’s faking it, that Ling Han looks far more at ease. If this continues, he’ll definitely win the match.”

“Haha! Didn’t He Jingyun say the loser would have to crawl out of this street?”

“I’m already eager to see that happen!”

“Mm-hm! It’s not every day you get to see a Level Six alchemist crawling along the street.”

The onlookers couldn’t help but whisper among themselves. They all believed that Ling Han had a greater chance of victory. However, refining a cauldron of Level Six Divine Pills would take around half a month. Thus, even though Ling Han looked to be in control, the true victor would only be determined in half a month’s time.

Many people became impatient, and they returned home to eat and sleep. They could simply return in half a month to witness who won.

Time crept by, and half a month quickly passed.

There was a look of exhaustion on He Jingyun’s face. They were refining Level Six Divine Pills, and intertwining the divine patterns within them required an astonishing amount of concentration and energy. Not only was it taxing on one’s divine sense, but it was also taxing on one’s Origin Power.

When refining such pills, alchemists usually ingested pills to replenish their Origin Power as they refined. However, He Jingyun indeed lived up to his name as a prodigy. He didn’t ingest a single pill from beginning to end.

This wasn’t out of conceit, but rather out of fear that he would lose concentration when ingesting those pills. He didn’t want to affect the quality of his pills.

Refining pills smoothly in one go was naturally the best.

However, he was almost about to be sucked dry. After refining this cauldron of pills, he would need to rest for at least one month.

Meanwhile, Ling Han’s condition caused the onlookers to click their tongues and shake their heads in wonder.

He still appeared at ease, and there wasn’t a bead of sweat on his forehead. The only difference was the extra glimmer in his eyes.

“Open!” He Jingyun shouted as he slapped his cauldron.

Pa!

The lid of his cauldron flew up, and three pills immediately attempted to fly out as if they were trying to escape. He Jingyun was prepared for this, and he grabbed at the pills with his right hand. The three pills instantly landed in his palm.

A look of satisfaction appeared on his face. In the past, he could only refine two pills at most. However, he had performed above par this time, successfully refining three pills.

‘Haha! Victory is mine, right?’

Ling Han also slapped his cauldron.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Like with He Jingyun, several dots of light flew from his cauldron. However, there were clearly more than three dots of light.

Five pills!

Pu!

The alchemists from the Treasure Forest Pavilion instantly spluttered loudly. Although none of them could refine the Explosive Thunder Pill, this didn’t prevent them from knowing that the maximum number of Explosive Thunder Pills per cauldron was five.

In other words, Ling Han had achieved perfection!

Pa!

The five pills landed in Ling Han’s palm. He unclasped his hand, and the five faint-blue pills immediately started to roll about as if they wanted to break free from his grasp and soar into the sky.

He Jingyun gritted his teeth, his face becoming a shade of red and a shade of blue. ‘I actually lost?!’

He couldn’t accept this!

If he lost, he would have to crawl out of this street. How could he show his face in the future?

“You’ve indeed refined more pills than me,” he shouted. “However, we still have to compare the quality of the pills. If your Explosive Thunder Pills only possess a quality of one or two stars, how can they compare to mine?”

This wasn’t unreasonable. However, successfully refining more pills usually meant that the pills were also of a higher quality. Thus, alchemists would only compare the quality of their pills if they had successfully refined the same number of pills.

He Jingyun was clearly unable to accept defeat.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Sure, then let’s appraise the pills!”
