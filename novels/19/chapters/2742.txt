2743 Grandson

An Tayun forcefully retracted his hand. However, with a single thought, An Xiu’er instantly collapsed to the ground. He was far too powerful, so there was absolutely no need for him to get physical to deal with a measly First Heaven Celestial King.

“Ping Tian, take your sister back inside,” he commanded.

“Father…” An Pingtian stepped forward, wanting to persuade his father.

“Hmm?” An Tayun shot a glare at him.

!!

An Pingtian instantly fell silent, not daring to say another word. In the An Clan, only his younger sister wasn’t afraid of their father. He and his six brothers all respected and feared him.

An Tayun turned his gaze back to Ling Feifan. This brat had to die.

Ling Feifan sighed, saying, “By the looks of it, I’m going to die here today! Father-in-law, aren’t you going to give it some more consideration? A son-in-law as outstanding as me is truly very difficult to find!”

“You’re already staring death in the face, yet you still insist on speaking with such a glib tongue?” An Tayun was even more displeased. He was fonder of modest and earnest children such as the third son of the Yang Clan. He had only cultivated for three billion years, yet he had already become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. In the future, he had the ability to become a Heavenly Venerate.

Only such kind of person was worthy of his daughter.

“Huh?” He suddenly faltered, looking up at the sky. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Whoosh!

A figure descended, his hair disheveled and covering his appearance. His clothes were also in tatters, and it was as if he were a beggar.

This was naturally Ling Han. He had followed the source of his apprehension, and that had brought him all the way here. The captured young man was the source of his apprehension.

Who was this? Why did he cause his heart to waver?

Ling Han had been cultivating in earnest for the past epoch, so he hadn’t paid any attention to his appearance. Even though his clothes were all treasures, the harsh environments that he traveled through caused them to gradually experience decay.

An Pinghai immediately stepped forward, and asked, “Friend, who are you?”

Ling Han didn’t reply, instead staring at Ling Feifan. Why did this person cause his heart to waver?

It was very clear that this person was in a perilous situation, facing the risk of death at any moment. However, what did this have to do with him?

‘Huh? Why is this person’s appearance so similar to mine?’

“What’s your name,” Ling Han asked. When he spoke the first word, there was struggle in his voice. Indeed, this was his first time speaking in almost an entire epoch. However, when he reached the last word, he had already largely recovered, with his voice exuding a sense of indescribable might.

“This junior is Ling Feifan. My respects to Senior,” Ling Feifan hurriedly replied. This person was his potential savior, so he naturally had to latch on with both hands.

“Ling Feifan?” Ling Han murmured. This person’s surname was actually Ling as well? Perhaps this was his descendent?

However, Ling Jianxue was his only son, so perhaps this was his grandson? Or great-grandson?

“You two!!” An Pinghai said in rage. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, after all, so were his words really so useless? Moreover, there was still a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate before them! Was it truly okay for them to ignore him?

“What’s your relationship with Ling Jianxue?” Ling Han asked.

Ling Feifan was truly astonished upon hearing this. He had only planned to randomly grab onto any potential savior, yet this person truly had a deep relationship with the Ling Clan? He faltered for a moment before replying, “He’s my father.”

He then asked, “Senior… you are?”

‘He’s my grandson!’

Ling Han was astonished. The brat Ling Jianxue had already given him a grandson? However, upon further thought, an entire epoch had already passed, so to say nothing of a grandson, he should have already had great-great-great-great grandchildren.

“You two!!” An Pinghai shouted through gritted teeth. They were taking things much too far!

“Pinghai!” An Tayun said in a solemn voice. Even though the man before them was disheveled and in tattered clothing, and even though he didn’t exude a single wisp of energy, he still gave him a feeling of extreme danger.

Where had this elite come from?

However, An Pinghai didn’t possess the good judgment of his father. In his eyes, he had already seen all of the Heavenly Venerates of this realm, and Ling Han wasn’t among the ranks of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Thus, what did he need to be afraid of?

“I’ll capture him!” he said as he reached over, grabbing at Ling Han.

A murderous glint flashed across Ling Han’s eyes. In the past, hundreds of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had died at his hands, yet a measly Ninth Heaven Celestial King dared to attack him? However, he immediately remembered that this wasn’t the Realm Battlefield. This person wasn’t a mortal enemy.

Thud, thud, thud…

After seeing Ling Han’s glare, An Pinghai involuntarily stumbled back. It was as if a legendary beast had locked its eyes on him, causing him to perspire in terror.

An Tayun had no time to console his son. He stared at Ling Han and said in a solemn voice, “Friend, you’re an elite from which place?”

The words of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate were naturally different. Wind and clouds suddenly swirled, with even heaven and earth starting to wail.

Only at this moment did Ling Han turn his gaze to An Tayun. He nodded, and replied, “My name is Ling Han.”

Pu!

Ling Feifan coughed and spluttered upon hearing this. This person was actually his grandfather?! F*ck! How could there be such a coincidence? Hadn’t his grandfather gone to the transcendent dimension? Why had he suddenly appeared here?

“Grandpa!” he instinctively called.

“Ling Han?” An Tayun murmured. He had never heard this name before.

However, since Ling Feifan was referring to him as grandpa, this person was most likely an elite from the Promise City Realm. In other words, he was an enemy.

Ling Han turned to Ling Feifan, and asked, “What’s going on?”

Even though Ling Feifan couldn’t confirm Ling Han’s identity, his relationship with An Xiu’er was no big secret. Thus, he explained the situation to Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. He then turned to An Tayun, and said, “Since the love between them is mutual, why stand in their way?”

‘Rubbish! Of course you’re happy! After all, the one being tricked away isn’t your daughter!’ An Tayun muttered in his mind.

Upon further thought, he realized that if the two youths truly tied the knot, wouldn’t he become Ling Han’s junior? F*ck! How could he allow that? He was the ruler of this dimension! At most, the others could only enjoy a status equal to his. How could they enjoy a status above him?

“Is he worthy?” An Tayun asked as he pointed at Ling Feifan.

Ling Han smiled, replying, “He’s my grandson, so of course he’s worthy!”

Even though his voice was calm, it was filled with a sense of dominance.

Even An Tayun faltered upon hearing this. However, he immediately bared his teeth. Sure enough, these two shared a bloodline. The grandson was glib of tongue, and his grandfather was also confident for apparently no reason.

The Promise City Realm was already on the verge of destruction, yet Ling Han was still filled with such confidence?

“Then I must ask for a lesson to see just how capable you are,” An Tayun said in a baleful voice.

Ling Han was slightly hesitant as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

If he had spent all of his time on increasing his cultivation level, he would have at least reached the Third Tier or Fourth Tier. At that time, he could easily kill a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate with a single smack.

In reality, however, he had spent all of his time and effort on fusing and condensing his core. Thus, even though his cultivation level hadn’t increased, his battle prowess had definitely soared to great heights. As for how high, even Ling Han didn’t know.

It had already been a very long time since his last battle.

What if his strike was too powerful, and he accidentally smacked An Tayun to death?

“You’re afraid?” An Tayun asked. He had truly been enraged by the grandfather and grandson duo of the Ling Clan. It was because of this that he uttered such a taunt.

Ling Han replied honestly, “I’m considering how much power I should use. Otherwise, it won’t be good if I accidentally smack you dead.”

‘F*ck!’

Ling Feifan immediately nodded in his mind. This was definitely his grandfather. They were definitely related by blood. His manner of speaking was exactly the same as his. As for whether Ling Han was truly capable… Hopefully, his words weren’t empty threats.
