Chapter 668: The Ninth Underworld King Appears

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

Ling Han felt a familiar presence.

This was Heavenly Phoenix Divine maiden. He’d been tormented by her countless times in the previous life, resulting in him being extremely sensitive towards this kind of aura. In the later periods, he could sense it when Heavenly Divine Phoenix Maiden hadn’t even approached in a five-kilometer radius, and would immediately take to his heels.

Now, Ling Han was left with endless yearning.

Heavenly Phoenix appeared, and with a sharp cry, charged the Corpse King.

This Heavenly Phoenix was at least 350 meters long, and with its wings spread, it even reached 660 meters in width; in front of it, the Corpse King immediately became similar to a kid. Its speed was too fast, and with a flutter of its wings, it dove before the Corpse King. Without any mystic arts, it just tore with its claws and pecked with its beak, yet caused terrifying destruction.

The Corpse King roared angrily, but was totally suppressed by the Heavenly Phoenix. Its entire body fell towards the ground and reached out with both hands to push the Heavenly Phoenix, but its hands were burnt black.

Such a terrifying Spirit Tool!

Ling Han compared it to Demon Birth Sword, and instantly felt that Demon Birth Sword was pathetically weak. However, he’d never fully unleashed Demon Birth Sword’s true might, and for it to become a tenth-tier Spirit Tool, how could it be ordinary?

His tier was too low, after all.

Xiu!

At this moment, a flash of saber light swept by. It was undoubtedly light, yet it was extremely dark as if gloomier than the dark night, emitting the presence of death.

This saber strike was going straight for the Heavenly Phoenix!

“You dare!” Azure Phoenix Divine Empress moved with her sword, and arrived before the saber light in a flash. With a slash of her sword, her attack turned out to be a 300 meters long Sword Ray.

Peng!

A heavy bang resonated, and everyone’s ears instantly went deaf. Completely unable to hear sounds, the entire world seemed to become extremely quiet, and only the Corpse King and the Heavenly Phoenix were carrying out a soundless fight.

“Divine Empress, long time no see.” A faint voice came from afar. It was gentle and soft, yet filled with a ghastly cold presence as if coming from the underworld itself.

“Ninth! Underworld! King!” Azure Phoenix Divine Empress said word by word. A chilling glare burst within her eyes, and her aura immediately increased by several folds.

Ling Han was shocked. This was Azure Divine Phoenix Empress’s true strength? Earlier, she had been just playing around with the Corpse King?

Who was the Ninth Underworld King?

Far away, that voice went on, “This lord came here only to take what this sect has left here several thousand years ago. Why must Divine Empress act as if a confronted by a formidable enemy?”

“Hmph, you even dared to scheme for this place. Is the Thousand Corpse Sect inviting its own destruction?” Azure Phoenix Divine Empress said in an icy tone.

Ling Han instantly realized that this Ninth Underworld King was Thousand Corpse Sect’s sect master, or else he definitely wouldn’t have the right to converse with Heavenly Divine Phoenix Empress and make Azure Phoenix Divine Empress intentionally hold back, waiting for the appearance of the Ninth Underworld King.

“You guys eat meat, so can’t you give this sect some soup to drink?” Ninth Underworld King said indifferently, appearing extremely calm. However, his voice was truly horrifying, just as if it were coming from the underworld, and hearing it would make one’s soul freeze.

“Since the ancient times, good and evil have been incompatible, and annihilating you all is our responsibility!” Azure phoenix Divine Maiden determinedly.

“Good!” In the surrounding, all the geniuses that participated in the exam raised their arms and called out in support. The Thousand Corpse Sect was a target of scorn, which everyone called out to kill!

Ling Han shook his head inwardly. The five sects and the Thousand Corpse Sect were actually birds of a feather, none any better than the other. However, the five sects did it cleanly, using ten thousand years to brainwash the realm, and now these people were just suckers being betrayed—just thinking about it was woeful.

The greatest woe was that even if you reminded them, they’d think you were saying frightening things to intentionally ruin the five great sect’s reputation.

Those able to think calmly were the meager lot.

The Ninth Underworld King wasn’t irritated, and said, “There are too many confused people in the world. If this lord wrote all the dirty work you guys have done into a short story and sold it to the entire world, would you say that there’d be people who’d believe it? As long as one person believes, a seed would be planted, and the seed would become a towering tree sooner or later.”

“Spread fallacies to deceive people, and this empress will cut you down today!” Azure Phoenix Divine Empress said coldly, and charged where the Ninth Underworld King was with her sword.

Weng!

A flash of saber light soared into the sky as a lofty man appeared, holding a large dark saber. Dark light intertwined around his entire body, and he was as if a demonic god that could support the firmament and crumble the underworld.

This was Thousand Corpse Sect’s Ninth Underworld King?

In comparison, Rong Huan Xuan was a small fry relying on Three Lives Casket to run rampant; he was in no way comparable with the Ninth Underworld King at all.

“Then let this lord experience the Divine Empress’s sword techniques!” The Ninth Underworld King waved his saber and engaged her in a fight. It was obviously also a tenth-tier Spirit Tool, and it was one of Thousand Corpse Sect’s three great sect treasures, Demonic Noise Saber!

Hu!

As the Demonic Noise Saber was swung, an extremely strange sound resonated, and the sound waves manifested into countless monsters with sabers, swords, and weapons, slashing at Azure Phoenix Divine Empress.

“Battle up in the skies!” Azure Phoenix Divine Empress soared towards the skies.

“As you wish!” The Ninth Underworld King also soared into the skies.

The two great Shattering Void Tier warriors engaged in a great battle, but Ninth Underworld King’s weapon had the advantage, because Heavenly Phoenix Sword’s Spirit Tool already left the sword and was in a fierce fight with the Corpse King. Now, Heavenly Phoenix Sword was just a sharp tenth-tier weapon, and not a Spirit Tool.

For elites at their level, a small gap could influence the outcome of the battle, let alone a tool spirit’s presence.

At the scene, the Ninth Underworld King had complete advantage, but it also wasn’t easy for an elite at this level to be defeated. Azure Phoenix Divine Maiden could sustain her resistance for a long, long time, and when Heavenly Phoenix Sword’s tool spirit suppressed the Corpse King, the situation in their battle would change again.

“Hehe!” Ninth Underworld King was composed, not at all rushed, and said, “Divine Empress, you think this sect waited several thousand years just for a normal Corpse King?”

As he spoke, that Corpse King underwent another transformation. Its body shrunk again and became only sixty meters tall, but its forehead manifested another eye. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

An eleventh eye!

Instantly, the Corpse King’s might grew greatly, and it shook off the Heavenly Phoenix with a single attack. It opened its mouth and spat out a dark light, which was as if shackles, wrapping around the Heavenly Phoenix. This light was extremely fast as it bound the Heavenly Phoenix, tightening, and actually manifesting, with bone spikes firing out, piercing into the Heavenly Phoenix’s body.

The Heavenly Phoenix cried in pain, and as it flapped its wings, large constellations of stars were shattered in the sky.

Azure Phoenix Divine Empress revealed a shocked look, and said, “You retrieved the Pond of the Underworld!”

If it weren’t for the Pond of the Underworld’s water’s blessing, the Corpse King definitely wouldn’t break through the limit of ten eyes. She should’ve known! It was just that the Thousand Corpse Sect had long lost the knowledge of the whereabouts of their three great sect treasures several tens of millennia ago.

“Correct!” the Ninth Underworld King said loftily.

Azure Phoenix Divine Empress thought shortly, suddenly realizing something, and said, “The Pond of the Underworld was within Million Treasures City. So that’s why you spent so much effort scheming to take down that city.”

“As expected of the Divine Empress, how truly exceptionally intelligent!” the Ninth Underworld King applauded. “To nourish this Corpse King, this lord took all of the Pond’s water, convinced that... this Corpse King can at least evolve into a fifteen-eyed one!”

Azure Phoenix Divine Empress’s countenance changed again and again. This time, she finally felt it difficult to handle.
