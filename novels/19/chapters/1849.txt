Chapter 1850: An unconventional auction

Ling Han nodded, “Then, let’s begin the auction. Come, make your bid, don’t be reserved.”

Was there an auction like this?

To say nothing of the fact that the three sneak attackers were all gritting their teeth, even Lu Xianming’s expression was a little strange. He had indeed met a considerable number of eccentrics and unusual characters, but this was the first time he had met someone like Ling Han.

“1,000,000 Star Stones!” However, Lu Xianming still spoke up immediately.

1,000,000 Star Stones was an exorbitant sum anywhere, but he had said it very casually and easily, as if that wasn’t 1,000,000 Star Stones, but only a pile of rubble.

The third sneak attacker immediately broke out in a cold sweat. In a competition of wealth, how was he to compete with the Holy Son of Alchemy City?

However, he still shouted, “10,000,000!”

Ling Han looked suspiciously at him, and asked, “Hey, do you know what punishment will be given for malicious bidding?”

The third sneak attacker hurriedly explained, “As long as you kill him, we can use his head to trade for endless wealth. To say nothing of 10,000,000, even a 100,000,000 or a billion would be no hard feat!”

Hearing these words, Lu Xianming frowned slightly. It was indeed as the other said. His life was very valuable, whether dead or alive.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel amused. “I really couldn’t tell that you are actually a smart one. However, since that guy’s head is so valuable, why should I not take it and turn it in by myself, but insist on having you do the job?”

“That’s because you have no idea whom you should look for!” that person called out, and actually seemed a little proud.

“Your words are quite logical.” Ling Han nodded, and this caused the expressions of Lu Xianming and his seven subordinates to shift. They had really feared that Ling Han would agree.

Though Ling Han hadn’t really made a move, merely his current action was frightening enough. No one would want to push him towards the other side and become their enemy.

“Sir, you do not yet know who my young master is, right?” a guard asked, revealing Lu Xianming’s identity. “My young master, Lu Xianming, is one of the 11 Holy Sons of Alchemy City, and is the man who has the highest chance of inheritance!”

“Alchemy City, a four-star force, and further, we are not an ordinary four-star force, either. Our Alchemy City has gathered more than 90% of the alchemists in the Eastern Celestial Realm. It can be said that in the whole Celestial Realm, at least 40% of all alchemical pills have come from the hands of our Alchemy City.”

‘Oh, so they happen to be alchemists.’

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head, and he had had an understanding. He asked, “The three of you have probably been sent by Lu Xianming’s competitors, right?”

When it involved a contest of power, it had always been cruel and ruthless. Even members of the same family could possibly turn hostile against one another. And this was something that Ling Han had experienced deeply long ago in the small world. It was not all that different in the Celestial Realm, either.

From a small world to the Celestial Realm, the only thing that had changed was strength, and the unchanging factor was human will.

Those three did not answer, which was equivalent to having given tacit admission.

Ling Han did not take it to heart, and said, “The fact that you are having internal strife in your own clan has nothing to do with me. However, I have never developed the habit of using the lives of innocents to make profit. You all had best just hand over whatever you have in your pockets. We are but strangers coming together by chance, and I will leave immediately, so forgive me for not accepting credit.”

“Sir, could it be that you have not heard clearly? Our young master is a Holy Son of Alchemy City!” A guard couldn’t help but exclaim loudly, reminding Ling Han.

The Holy Son of Alchemy City had many alchemists under his command that he could mobilize, and how many contacts did every alchemist have?

This was an incredibly frightening number!

It could be said that the chairperson of Alchemy City was definitely the top person beneath Celestial Kings. No other four-star force would dare to trifle with them, and in terms of wealth, the only other force that could compare with them was the Massive Military Pavilion.

‘Though you are very strong, you are still only a third severance. If it was not for the fact that this is a unique situation, what need would there be for us to curry favor with you?’

Ling Han turned and looked at that person, dissatisfaction on his face. “I am doing business here, and you are crashing my party?” He pressed down a palm, and that guard instantly collapsed onto the ground, his forehead covered with cold sweat.

Too frightening. Though he had not been injured, an extremely domineering aura was practically enough to scare him out of his wits.

Ling Han withdrew his gaze, and broke into a grin, saying, “Come, let’s continue.”

This time, everyone did not fight further. Ling Han’s strength was enough to overwhelm everything. He only had to lean slightly towards one side, and then that side would be able to gain an absolute victory, so what was the point of further fighting?

Lu Xianming frowned as well. He had not brought many Star Stones with him on this trip, and he feared that he would not be able to win out over those three.

Pa, pa, pa.

Both sides began to collect their wealth.

Multiple Star Stones and Godly metal were taken out of their Spatial God Tools, and respectively piled up on either side.

Unfortunately, Ling Han was doing a real-time valuation there as well, so neither side dared to relax, and they were taking out all their valuables as much as they could.

To be honest, those seven guards really didn’t have much wealth. The majority depended completely on Lu Xianming, and the three sneak attackers were assassins, but had accumulated a considerable amount of wealth. Thus, who would actually come out on top in the competition between both sides was actually hard to determine.

“Go! Go!” Ling Han cheered both sides on, causing Lu Xianming and the three assassins to almost gain a feeling of unity against a common enemy. ‘Can you f****** not want to make an easy profit like this? Could you have some consideration for our feelings?’

As time passed, their movements to take things out slowed down gradually. That was because they really couldn’t find anything else valuable even after a thorough search.

When both sides were completely unable to take anything else out, Ling Han looked towards the three assassins, and smilingly said, “Congratulations. You have won in this competition. En, do you have some words of thanks to say?”

‘You have really f****** screwed us over!’ the three assassins said internally.

These really were words of utmost sincerity from them. Though they had won this competition, they had emptied out all their savings as well. This was a definite loss for them!

Thankfully, once they killed Lu Xianming, they would be able to earn a little back at least.

Meanwhile, Lu Xianming’s expression shifted slightly, while his seven subordinates were extremely furious. They each gripped their weapons tightly, standing guard around Lu Xianming.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “You guys can scram.”

The three assassins faltered. ‘Didn’t we win? Why are you telling us to scram?’

“This is your compensation for my loss. When have I agreed to help you kill anyone?” Ling Han glared at them. “Scram quickly, or I will start a new auction.”

When the three assassins heard this, their faces immediately turned green, and they hurriedly broke into a run. They swore internally; they were determined not to meet Ling Han again in this lifetime. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

En, this shouldn’t be a vow, but rather a prayer. After all, if it was just them vowing, it would not be of use.

Lu Xianming and his group finally sighed in relief, but their faces immediately turned green because not only did Ling Han stow away the property of the three assassins, he did not spare even theirs.

“Sir, you...” A guard couldn’t help but call out. ‘Why are you taking our stuff too?’

Ling Han glared at him, and said, “Don’t you know the rules? Could it be that I have not saved the life of your young master, so shouldn’t I accept a little reward for it? Who do you guys think I am? The Saintly Celestial King?

The seven guards were instantly rendered speechless. Only now did they know how ruthless Ling Han was. He was basically taking from both sides.

Yet Lu Xianming rubbed his hands and laughed loudly, saying, “My dear friend, you are truly a unique character. Dare I ask how I should address you?”

“Ling Han,” Ling Han casually replied as he continued to stow everything away into the Black Tower.

“Brother Ling, are you willing to work for me? As for rewards, just name the price!” Lu Xianming said proudly. He did indeed have such confidence. Alchemy City was definitely the wealthiest four-star force in the whole world, and even the Massive Military Pavilion could fall behind them, flabbergasted. The latter could only just barely compare to the former.
