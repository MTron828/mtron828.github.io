3237 Butler Mu’s Request

Hu Can could never believe that Ling Han was actually a High Level alchemist!

Even Elementary Level alchemists were at least in their thirties or forties. After all, there were very few prodigies like Zhong Yangbi.

However, who would believe that a young man who was not even 20 years old had become a High Level alchemist?

The problem was, why was Butler Mu covering up for Ling Han?

If the other party was deliberately biased, he could completely distort the facts.

Because Butler Mu was in the Extreme Bone Tier!

Moreover, Ling Han was in the right in this matter. It was only because he had attacked too ruthlessly and killed Hu Qiu that the situation had worsened.

‘But even if you’re biased, you don’t have to use such a ridiculous reason, right?’

A twenty-year-old High Level alchemist? Pfft!

“Butler Mu, you must be joking.” Hu Can chuckled.

Pa, Butler Mu raised his hand and slapped Hu Can again. Instantly, Hu Can was sent flying again.

“Are you worthy for me to joke around with you?” Butler Mu said coldly.

The members of the Hu Clan were angry but did not dare to say anything.

Their Grand Elder had been slapped in the face as if he was being spanked. Who would feel proud? Slapping their Grand Elder’s face was equivalent to slapping the face of the entire Hu Clan. Everyone did not feel good!

Hu Can got up, his expression extremely ugly.

Everyone said that things could not be done more than three times, but he had been slapped three times by Butler Mu in a short period of time. Even a clay figurine would be angry. After all, he was the Clan Leader of the Hu Clan, one of the six major noble clans.

“If you dare to say another word, I’ll kill you,” Butler Mu balefully said.

Instantly, Hu Can’s open mouth closed involuntarily. The words that were about to come out of his mouth turned into a silent sigh and he swallowed them back into his stomach.

Forget it. In comparison, his pride was not as important as his life.

“Ling Han, how do you want to resolve this?” Butler Mu looked at Ling Han with a hint of admiration in his eyes.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “The culprit, Hu Qiu, has already been executed, but the shock my little handmaiden suffered naturally needs to be compensated. As for me, although I’ve suffered some injuries, as a member of the Xuanqing Banner, saving others is my duty, so I don’t need compensation.”

‘Hey, hey, hey, aren’t you guys going too far? Just deciding things on your own?’

Was the Hu Clan… that easy to bully?

Hu Can sighed. In front of an Extreme Bone martial artist, the Hu Clan was really going to be bullied, unless the Hu Clan could get a powerful backer.

“Please speak, Miss.” He admitted defeat.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Then just compensate her with a million.”

When the Hu Clan heard this, they were furious.

One million? Why don’t you go rob a bank instead!

How could a mere maid be worth a million? Besides, she was not injured at all. At most, they only had to give her a big red packet of money to calm her nerves. Did it have to be as much as a million?

Hu Can immediately wanted to reprimand Ling Han for demanding an exorbitant price, but when he saw Butler Mu’s baleful expression, his heart immediately trembled, and he said, “All right!”

Although a million was not a small sum, it was not considered a huge sum to a large clan like the Hu Clan either. It was not to the extent of really hurting their finances.

However, he really could not take this lying down.

He waved his hand, and someone immediately took out an optical computer to transfer the money. It was very convenient.

Butler Mu looked at Hu Can. “Don’t feel like you’ve lost out. In the future, you’ll know how much you’ve gained.”

After offending a High Level alchemist, he only had to pay a million. That was too cheap.

Of course, he chose to ignore the facts of Hu Qiu’s death and Hu Ronghai’s crippled arms.

Hu Can could only grit his teeth and swallow his anger. He secretly swore that this matter would not end so easily.

“Let’s go.” Butler Mu waved his hand and led the way. Ling Han and Lian Xuerong hurriedly followed, but Huan Xue did not move.

“Young Master, the piggy, the little piggy,” she said anxiously.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. He had forgotten about that lecherous pig.

“Er, we left a pig here. Hurry up and send it over,” he turned around and said.

‘Pig?’

The members of the Hu Clan were all furious.’ It was one thing for you to come here to flaunt your might, but with Butler Mu backing you up, we can only watch helplessly. But you still want to be aggressive and demand our Hu Clan for a pig?’

They couldn’t take it anymore!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Butler Mu, this pig of mine is a little special. You can’t buy it anywhere.”

“Oh?” Butler Mu nodded and looked at Hu Can.

Hu Can could only grit his teeth and say, “All of you, go and find it.”

The Hu Clan was quite efficient. Twenty minutes later, a woman walked over with a pig in her arms. There was another Hu Clan member beside her. It was him who had found this woman.

Ling Han took a look, and saw that the little pink pig was currently sprawled out over the woman’s breasts, with a look of enjoyment on its face.

Lustful pig, indeed.

“Little piggy!” Huan Xue quickly ran over and took the little piggy from her arms.

That woman was still a little reluctant. The little pink pig’s appearance was full of deception. That appearance was too cute because Lian Xuerong’s eyes also lit up slightly when she saw it.

The little pink pig looked around and saw Lian Xuerong. Indeed, it was the other party’s especially shapely breasts that made it unable to help but drool. It immediately struggled as if it wanted to break free from Huan Xue’s embrace and rush towards Lian Xuerong.

What a lecherous pig!

Ling Han picked up the little pink pig, and said, “Alright, let’s go.”

The four of them filed out. After leaving the Hu Clan, Butler Mu said to Ling Han, “Follow me.”

Ling Han nodded, tossed the little pink piglet to Huan Xue, and said, “You and Banner Lord Lian return to the camp first.”

Huan Xue hurriedly nodded. She kept thinking that it was because of her that such great trouble had been caused, so she naturally became more obedient.

Lian Xuerong left with Huan Xue, and didn’t ask any further questions. She didn’t have the right to interfere with what an Extreme Bone Tier elite wanted to do.

However, she naturally believed that Butler Mu had no ill intentions towards Ling Han.

“Walk with me,” Butler Mu said.

Ling Han nodded, his expression calm.

Firstly, he had the heart of an elite. Secondly, he was a High Level alchemist, and his status was not inferior to Butler Mu’s at all.

“Young friend, I originally thought that your natural talent in alchemy was outstanding. I didn’t expect you to be so freakish in martial arts as well,” Butler Mu praised.

Ling Han merely smiled slightly, and said, “Thank you for the compliment.”

“Therefore, I have a favor to ask of you,” Butler Mu said solemnly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ling Han was astounded. An Extreme Bone Tier elite was actually requesting his help?

Was it to concoct an alchemical pill?

He paused for a moment and said, “Butler Mu, please speak.” Ultimately, he owed Butler Mu a favor for today’s matter, so if Butler Mu wanted to ask him to refine an alchemical pill, he didn’t mind helping as long as the ingredients were ready.

Butler Mu smiled and said, “If there’s a chance, please take Young Miss away.”

Eh? Ah!

This wasn’t right.
