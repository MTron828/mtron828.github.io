Chapter 2003: Breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier

This damn Small Tower was always willing to say the most crucial things at the final moment.

Ling Han did not tell the Empress and the others, because none of them had any Source Powers. Even if he did tell them, what could be done? It would only leave them with regrets for nothing.

It was already quite good. Breaking through with a purple grade Yang Soul Stone was not too far off from perfection.

Moreover, just how many Severing Mundane Tiers in the world would be able to obtain Source Powers?

“Given what you said, the next three times I divide my spirit, I would also have to split out these Source Powers?” Ling Han asked. “Then, what about the Regulations that I have to comprehend?”

“Stupid!” Small Tower scoffed. “What does Dividing Soul Tier mean? The divided soul is a portion of you that has been split out. No matter how far the distance is between you, you would be able to sense it, so how could you possibly be unable to comprehend the Regulations of heaven and earth?

“Furthermore, if you split your soul using the Source Powers, the limit is not four times, but rather... nine!”

Nine was the largest number in the world.

Ling Han’s lips involuntarily twitched, and he said, “I only have three Source Powers. If I can’t find more of them, wouldn’t I then be trapped at Earth Soul Tier?”

“Thus, you have to hurry and find more Source Powers,” Small Tower declared very irresponsibly.

Ling Han was speechless. Source Powers were not cabbages. Just because you wanted them, you could get them?

Moreover, though there were many types of Source Powers—the Five Elements, Lightning, Time, Space, Slaughter, Poison, and so on—every type could split out nine Source Powers, and upon first glance, there really seemed to be a considerable number of them.

However, just how big was the Celestial Realm? And how many Celestial Kings were there? To gather nine Source Powers, and all of them had to be for different Regulations at that... The difficulty level of this was actually even higher than breaking through to the Celestial King Tier.

...Ling Han had already gotten three Source Powers? That was all thanks to luck, but he couldn’t depend on luck every time, right?

“Perhaps I can also live on good luck,” Ling Han mumbled.

A Severing Mundane Tier only needed to reach fifth severance to be perfect, but Dividing Nine Souls actually required nine times!

“If I really could split my soul nine times, just how strong would I be?” Ling Han couldn’t help but feel curious.

“If you want to become a Heavenly Venerate, you would have to cultivate every single cultivation level to perfection.” Small Tower did not answer his question, but encouraged Ling Han from a different angle.

Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han tightened his fist. Small Tower really had gotten hold of his weakness. As long as there was a more perfect path to take, he would choose this path without any hesitation, and would not care at all just how difficult it would be to tread on this path.

He began to stimulate the three Source Powers. Instantly, whether it was the Nine Heavens Flame, the Xuanyin Source Water, or the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, they all became restless.

They had chosen Ling Han as their master, but their personality had not been completely erased. They had an instinctive urge to pursue independence.

Ling Han thought for a while, and decided to split out the Nine Heavens Flame first.

This was the first Source Power that he had obtained, and reasonably it should be the first. Moreover, he did not have enough Source Powers now. When he broke through to Yin Soul and Earth Soul next, he would split out the Xuanyin Source Water and Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood. There wouldn’t be too much of a gap in time.

He carefully extracted the Nine Heavens Flame from his Dantian; it had already become one with him. No matter how he split it out, it would still have an unbreakable relation with him.

A day later, the Nine Heavens Flame was fully split out, and hopped around in the palm of his right hand.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and pressed his right hand on the Yang Soul Stone in front of him. Immediately, the Nine Heavens Flame slipped in with a crackle. Boom, the Yang Soul Stone vibrated lightly, and then the tremors became stronger, but peace returned very soon.

From the outside, the Yang Soul Stone had become transparent. One could clearly see a flame burning in its exact center, as if it had become an infant that was curled up. Vaguely, there would be slight tremors, just like fetal movement.

Ling Han sat down by the side, and sensed the changes of the divided soul.

In the next month, it would be the process of the divided soul transforming into human, and the changes of the divided soul would also affect him, thus breaking the limits of the Severing Mundane Tier, and advancing into a new cultivation level.

Time flew past, and the Nine Heavens Flame fetus was continuously nurtured. Gradually, it had assumed the appearance of an infant, and Ling Han had also begun undergoing a great transformation. The divided soul was actually the true self. Thus, when the divided soul underwent a massive change, the original would also change drastically.

Dividing Soul Tier, break through!

Boom!

Ling Han’s black locks flew upwards, his whole body covered with seals of great dao. The Black Tower was also lightly trembling, as if some kind of change had taken place.

Only after a whole nine days did Ling Han’s hair fall back down. The seals on his body had also dimmed, but another day later, his hair rose skywards again, and all the seals on his body lit up once more.

Another nine days later, peace returned once more to him, but after just another day, change took place again.

It had been a month.

The Yang Soul Stone had undergone a massive change. Through the transparent stone, a human figure could be clearly seen inside. He looked exactly like Ling Han, but multiple seals of fire had formed on his body. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This was the benefit of using a Source Power as your divided soul. It could fully display its might.

Kakaka, multiple cracks appeared on the surface of the Yang Soul Stone, as close as a spider’s web. Then, a bang was heard as the Yang Soul Stone suddenly cracked apart, and a figure leaped out.

Ling Han’s divided soul, or rather his Yang Soul, the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul.

On the other side, the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou had also completed the last of their transformation. This process of breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier was the process of nurturing the divided soul. It was always a month’s time. It would either succeed or fail. There was no such thing as you taking one month, and me having to spend two months.

Hong, long, long, tribulation clouds suddenly gathered above their heads. The heavenly tribulation was coming.

Even in a natural Mystery Realm, on this kind of deep ocean bed, the heavenly tribulation would come when it willed, without the slightest bit of reservation.

Ling Han released a battle cry, and went forth to greet the heavenly tribulation.

Kuang, the heaven and earth raged, and lightning crashed.

But Ling Han had already been able to suppress Yin Soul and match Earth Soul long ago, when he had just been at the fifth severance. Now that he had broken through, how far would his battle prowess go then?

A true monarch tier could be invincible even with a gap of two levels!

In other words, he would be able to easily suppress even Earth Souls, and would be able to match the early stage of Heaven Soul.

With this kind of strength, what was a heavenly tribulation worth?

Ling Han used the heavenly tribulation to temper his own self, but as his cultivation level progressed, the improvement to his physique had also become slower and slower, more and more difficult.

‘Looks like I have to go and piggyback off of other people’s heavenly tribulation,’ he thought. By now, half a day of tempering from the heavenly tribulation was not enough at all for him, and could not completely temper his physique.

He finished enduring the heavenly tribulation, and the Empress and the others had also completed the last step of their breakthrough. They each set out to the center of the canyon.

“Hahaha, this time, who can come and steal Niu’s food!” Hu Niu laughed loudly. Now, she was not just one person, but rather two.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. The little girl indeed did justice to her name as a glutton. Others would think how much their battle prowess would increase with another doppelganger, but all her concentration was on food.

The Empress did not speak. Instead, her figure trembled, and nine doppelgangers were split out. Then, the Yang Soul also trembled, and nine doppelgangers were split out once more.

Hu Niu was dumbfounded. Originally, one fighting against 10 was already a great disadvantage, and now she only had one additional helper, while the other had another 10. Then wouldn’t it be a greater disadvantage?

‘Wayaya, this is bullying Niu too far.’

Ling Han roared with laughter, and said, “Come, let’s get some more Yang Soul Stones, and go and sell them!”
