Chapter 1237: Whereabouts of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After battling for quite a while, Ling Han and Ma Zhang stopped fighting at the same time.

Neither of them had been serious, and they were wary of each other as well. Who knew what trump cards the other had up his sleeve?

“Brat, we will meet again!” Ma Zhang brought the two soldiers with him and turned to leave.

“Of course we will meet again. You still have to rebuild this courtyard for me!” Ling Han called out behind him.

Ma Zhang almost stumbled. This brat was really keeping this in his mind constantly. F***, it wasn’t just him at fault here!

Ling Han watched the other party leave, and did not pursue.

Obviously, he had also missed his aim, and did not know where the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was. This was the reason why Ling Han had not continued to fight with him. Furthermore, he already knew who he was, in any case—a subordinate of Great General Xie.

Great General Xie? It should be Xie Qian, one of the four Great Generals of the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire. Rumor had it that he was an elite of the Eternal River Tier, but his exact cultivation level was unknown. If this kind of elite did not choose to reveal it himself, who would be able to estimate his cultivation level?

Since that was the case, he could run, but he couldn’t hide.

Ling Han turned around. Perhaps Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang would know where the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had gone, or perhaps she might have even gone to the Han Lin Pavilion, and he had just missed her.

Two days later, he came back to Big Trade City.

“Master! Master!” Once Kang Xiu Yuan saw him, he immediately called out to him, his expression filled with nervousness and panic.

“What is it?” Ling Han asked.

“A letter from Mistress!” Kang Xiuyuan handed a letter over.

Ling Han’s heart was filled with worry in the first place, so he hurriedly snatched the letter. As his eyes swept over the letter, he soon found out the gist of the story.

The matter was actually very simple.

The Cloud Phoenix Sect expressed the intention to develop relations with Great General Xie to increase their status. But as a powerful elite of the Eternal River Tier, who would take note of a force that was only of the Sun Moon Tier? Then, since they could not develop relations with the Great General Xie directly, they could only do so in a more roundabout way.

They sought out the seventh grandchild of the Great General Xie, Xie Donglai.

Xie Donglai was an extremely outstanding young man among the younger generation of the Xie Clan. He had only cultivated for about 100,000 years, and he was already at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and now had some say in the Xie Clan. If he could break through to Heavenly Body Tier as well, he would definitely become an influential person in the Xie Clan.

Thus, the Cloud Phoenix Sect wanted to form an alliance by marriage with the Xie Clan, and the other party was this Prince Xie.

Xie Donglai came on their invitation, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also tricked into coming by her sect. As a result, Xie Donglai took a fancy to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden with a single look, and after returning to the Imperial Capital, sent a messenger to deliver the message that he wished to take the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden as a concubine not many days later.

...For a crucial heir like him, the choice of the candidate for main wife naturally would not be his decision to make. It would rather be used to secure an ally that could be of aid to the Xie Clan through marriage, for example a loyal subordinate, or a state official of equal authority.

Thus, the small Cloud Phoenix Sect’s member naturally could not possibly be a candidate for main wife, but at least she would be married officially as a concubine, which guaranteed quite a high status as well. From the perspective of the Cloud Phoenix Sect, this was a step up the social ladder.

The Cloud Phoenix Sect naturally agreed happily, but how could the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden be willing?

She called herself the Ling Family’s Widow, and that was her stand and a kind of determination. However, though she presently had the abilities to stand against the Cloud Phoenix Sect, compared with a colossal entity like the Xie Clan, she was indescribably weak.

Hence, she decided to go to the Two Realm Battlefield. Only that was a place the power of the Xie Clan was unable to reach.

When Kang Xiu Yuan received the letter, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden should have already reached the Two Realm Battlefield.

Ling Han was furious. They actually wanted to force his wife to remarry; wasn’t this cuckolding him? This Cloud Phoenix Sect was really worthless, “forcing an honest girl into prostitution” for their own benefit!

That Xie Donglai too—he dared to try and snatch his wife! If he didn’t castrate him 10 times, it would not be enough to vent his fury!

“I plan to immediately go to the Two Realm Battlefield!” Ling Han decided promptly. The Two Realm Battlefield was really a slaughterhouse of life. Every year, every month, or even every day, the number of people who battled to the death there were uncountable.

Though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s bloodline was strong, and she had also reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, in the Two Realm Battlefield, her abilities were really insufficient. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden suffered the slightest injury, he would definitely come back and skin Xie Donglai! As for the Cloud Phoenix Sect, needless to say, its fate would be destruction by his hand anyway.

“Master, we shall go as well!” Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang hurriedly proclaimed.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “The two of you aren’t warriors, so why are you joining in on the excitement? Concoct alchemical pills obediently, and if the two of you have not yet advanced to become Level Six alchemists when I return, just wait to be beaten!”

“Ah!” The two cried out desperately. It would need at least a few millennia of accumulation to advance from Level Five to Level Six; they were still a far way off.

Ling Han did not care. Now that the conflict between the Han Lin Pavilion and Treasure Forest Pavilion had been resolved, his presence was no longer important. However, he had to be true to his word. He decided to first make a trip to the Treasure Forest Pavilion, and teach the pill recipe for the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill to Han Xinyan, and then head out to the Two Realm Battlefield. In any case, it was just a short trip.

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan naturally backed Ling Han’s idea to find the mistress. They both nodded. On one hand, they had to protect the Han Lin Pavilion, and complete Ling Han’s mission—to buy as much Level Five Godly metal as possible—and on the other, they had to work hard on their alchemy skills so that they could advance to become Level Six alchemists.

Ling Han set out all by himself, and did not alert his two brothers. He did not bring his disciple, Ding Ping, either. He even abandoned his four followers in Big Trade City. The Two Realm Battlefield was really too dangerous.

Only the Asura Demon Emperor and old ginseng were still left in the Black Tower.

To others, the Black Tower did not have Spiritual Qi, so it was not a suitable place for cultivation, and it only had the Reincarnation Tree to aid the comprehension of Dao. But for old ginseng, it was different because he himself was a Dao cultivated from a Godly medicine of heaven and earth, and the Black Tower had the ability to speed up the growth of plants. For him, though it was not as exaggerated as that, its benefits were still quite big.

Thus, he liked to stay in the Black Tower to absorb that kind of power when he had nothing else to do. Moreover, he liked to root himself under the Reincarnation Tree, and could comprehend Dao while he was at it. HIs improvement was very fast, and he looked just about ready to advance into the Sun Moon Tier.

Of course, if you wanted old ginseng to focus and work hard on cultivation, that was impossible. He would frequently come out and tease girls and women in Big Trade City. As long as they were the slightest bit beautiful, practically none had managed to escape from old ginseng’s “demonic claws”.

Ling Han soon arrived at the Treasure Forest Pavilion. Lin Yuqi had obviously made arrangements for him. The moment he appeared, the staff in the shop immediately greeted him respectfully as Elder Ling, and were incredibly reverent.

“Yo, have you missed me?” Lin Yuqi walked in a waft of fragrance, directly forcing her way to stand right in front of Ling Han, her proud breasts only one or two inches away from Ling Han at most.

Ling Han looked at anywhere but her, and said, “I have come to look for Han Xinyan to teach her the pill recipe of the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill.”

Lin Yuqi couldn’t help but get irritated. In Ling Han’s eyes, couldn’t she even compare that inexperienced, flat-chested little girl?

‘Calm down! Calm down!’ she advised herself, then waved a hand, and had someone bring Ling Han to find Han Xinyan as she scrambled her brains. How would she be able to enlighten a blockhead?

The difficulty... was huge!

Led by a maidservant, Ling Han entered into a backyard. This was obviously private territory, and only multiple beautiful maidservants would occasionally appear, with no further signs of any outsiders.
