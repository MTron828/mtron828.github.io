Chapter 1889: Promise

Afterward, Alchemist Zi Cheng taught Ling Han many things regarding Spirit Refinement. Of course, he also told Ling Han about the two other Four-Star Alchemists who resided in Alchemy City.

One of them was called Heavenly Heart, and he was an extremely peculiar being.

This was because he had no parents—he hadn’t been produced by a mother and a father. Instead, he had been nurtured by heaven and earth. His true body was actually a Celestial pill!

In terms of the exact time that he had been created, it was already too long ago to say with certainty. However, it was extremely likely that he had been created one epoch ago. At that time, there had still been a Five-Star Alchemist in Alchemy City, and he had refined a total of 11 Celestial pills during his lifetime. One of them was the Heavenly Heart Dao-Seeking Pill.

In fact, this was the last Celestial pill that the Five-Star Alchemist had refined. At the same time, it was also a culmination of his pinnacle skill, and it was the alchemical pill that he was the proudest of. As such, he always kept it by his side.

As time passed, this Celestial pill gradually gained awareness and sentience. It developed intelligence, and it eventually became a genuine life form. And thereupon, there was now Alchemist Heavenly Heart.

Because of his being a completely different life form, Alchemist Heavenly Heart’s personality was also extremely different from everyone else. He was completely invested in alchemy, and his goal was to create more life forms like himself so that he wouldn’t need to be lonely anymore.

The other Four-Star Alchemist was called Chu Ye, and he was an old geezer who had a strong addiction to wine. He also liked to travel around, and he was perhaps the only person in the world who had traveled throughout the entire Eastern Celestial Realm.

According to rumors, this old geezer was even willing to casually exchange Celestial pills for wine.

However, because he liked to travel, Chu Ye was almost never in Alchemy City. He would only return once every few thousand or tens of thousands of years.

It was because of this that Alchemist Zi Cheng could wield so much power in the Alchemy City. At the same time, it was also because of this that Alchemy Apprentice Mo, a measly alchemy apprentice, could become so arrogant and haughty. In fact, he was almost riding on the heads of the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters.

However, to appoint a new Holy Son was a matter of great significance. Thus, Alchemist Zi Cheng couldn’t decide this all by himself. Instead, he needed to seek agreement from the two other Four-Star Alchemists.

Seeking agreement from Alchemist Heavenly Heart would be relatively easy. After all, he also resided in Alchemy City. However, no one knew where Alchemist Chu Ye had run off to. Even if they possessed message transmission talismans to directly communicate with each other, just how large was the Celestial Realm? Thus, how long would it take for Alchemist Chu Ye to return?

That being the case, Alchemist Zi Cheng had given Ling Han a deadline of one year. In reality, this was a relatively relaxed requirement. After all, Alchemist Chu Ye definitely couldn’t return within such a short time.

Anyhow, Grandmaster Zi Cheng had set this requirement so that Ling Han would feel some pressure. Moreover, when Alchemy City appointed a new Holy Son, they would also need to invite the various forces in the surroundings to take part in the ceremony.

Because of Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s kindness, Ling Han naturally couldn’t hide his dirty secrets any longer. He revealed that he had once killed the Holy Son and Holy Daughter of two separate Celestial King Tier forces.

Alchemist Zi Cheng’s expression became extremely spectacular. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sure enough, this disciple was a huge trouble-maker!

To kill the Holy Sons, Holy Daughters, or successors of Celestial King Tier forces on a whim... Not only was this audacious, but it also represented absolute strength. No wonder he had even defeated Zhao Qingfeng.

“...No worries!” the elder said as he gritted his teeth. However, even though he said this, the bulging veins on his forehead were extremely clear.

Alchemy City was a four-star force, so its most powerful elite was only at the Ascending Origin Tier. Even with the lofty status of alchemists, it was still a struggle for them to rival Celestial King Tier forces. As such, they naturally couldn’t compare to genuine five-star forces.

If Ling Han had only pummeled or severely wounded the successors of some Celestial King Tier forces, Alchemy City could naturally resolve these situations by offering some compensation. With their lofty status as alchemists, the two Celestial King Tier forces naturally wouldn’t be too overbearing.

Now, however, Ling Han had actually killed the most talented successors of these two Celestial King Tier forces! That being the case, they had absolutely no reason to spare him!

“Fortunately, you have the support of the Roc Palace,” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said with a sigh of relief. “I’ve traveled to the Western Celestial Realm in the past, and I had wanted to find a skilled master there so that I could advance to become a Five-Star Alchemist. Thus, I have some slight understanding of this Roc Palace.

“This is a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, and such a powerful force is rare even in the Western Celestial Realm. It’s a true ruler of the lands.

“With the Roc Palace’s support, and with my help, we can perhaps resolve this troublesome situation.

“After all, the Zihe Clan and the Thundercloud Palace are only First Heaven Celestial King Tier forces!”

An expression of pride and haughtiness spread across Alchemist Zi Cheng’s face as he said this.

Perhaps Grandmaster Zi Cheng was the only Ascending Origin Tier elite who dared to say that these were “only” First Heaven Celestial King Tier forces. This expression of confidence and haughtiness was not something that ordinary Holy Sons and Holy Daughters could possess.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I’ve caused trouble for Master.”

Alchemist Zi Cheng wore a strange expression, and he said, “I have a nagging feeling that you’ll only be causing more trouble in the future! Sigh... I truly wonder whether taking you as a disciple is a blessing or a disaster for Alchemy City.”

To say this before Ling Han, it was clear that Grandmaster Zi Cheng already treated him as a true member of Alchemy City. He didn’t avoid saying this at all.

Ling Han was rendered completely speechless. He was a magnet for trouble, and this had been proved time and time again.

Not to mention more distant matters, he had only just defeated Zhao Qingfeng. If this caught the attention of Yan Xianlu, what would he do if Yan Xianlu wanted to take him as a subordinate?

He definitely wouldn’t agree to this. At that time... would he have to fight with Yan Xianlu?

However, he truly wanted to fight with Yan Xianlu. This was someone who had been born on the Celestial Path, and was renowned as an unparalleled Monarch tier. Just how powerful was he? Of course, this fight definitely couldn’t take place now. After all, Yan Xianlu had most likely reached the fifth severance already. If Ling Han battled with him now, he would definitely be pummeled if not killed.

Under the corrosive refinement power of Regulations, it would be useless regardless of how tough his Godly bones were.

‘So, my current aim is to reach the First Refinement and reach the peak stage of the fourth severance. Afterward, I need to open the door to the fifth severance,’ Ling Han said in his mind. Upon thinking of this, he mentioned the Natural Peach Seal to Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

“You actually want to reach the fifth severance?!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng asked in shock. He was truly given a fright.

Defeating Zhao Qingfeng had indeed proved the strength and talent of Ling Han. However, the fifth severance... This was far too intangible and unreachable. In fact, many considered the fifth severance as nothing more than a legend. They viewed this as an unreachable level.

However, his disciple actually wanted to reach the pinnacle of both cultivation and alchemy?

The elder pondered for a moment before saying, “Very well. As long as you become a Holy Son, your master will give you a Natural Peach Seal!”

He could only agree to this request because he was the true ruler of Alchemy City right now. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to pat his chest and make such a bold promise.

A “bashful” smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he asked, “Master, can I have two?”

Grandmaster Zi Cheng widened his eyes in astonishment. ‘Why do you want two? Perhaps you want to use one to eat the other?’

Ling Han rubbed his hands, and said, “Hehe, that, um... my wife also needs one.”

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was astounded upon hearing this. Another person aiming to reach the fifth severance?

Holy crap! This was a legendary level!

What did legendary mean?

Legendary meant that it only existed in legends, and was impossible to find in real life! Now, however, not only was Ling Han aiming to reach the fifth severance, but even his wife was aiming to reach the fifth severance!

Perhaps he had refined alchemical pills for far too long, so much so that he had become senile and foolish? Perhaps he had been cooped up in his house for too long, so much so that his news had become outdated?

No, he had to drink some wine 820,000,000 years old to suppress his astonishment...

“...We’ll discuss this when you become a Holy Son. If you succeed, this will be your reward from master!” In the end, Grandmaster Zi Cheng gritted his teeth and agreed to Ling Han’s request.

Even though he was an alchemist, he truly wanted to witness the birth of a fifth severance Monarch tier. Two, in fact. Moreover, they both had extremely strong ties and relationships with him.
