Chapter 2351: Jealousy

“I refuse to believe this!” that demon roared in fury. “How could I, Sihuang Yun, lose to a baby beast!”

From first look, he could tell that Little Terror had not been born very long ago. Its flame of life had only been burning for a limited period of time. If he lost to Little Terror, he would really become a massive joke. In the future, he would never be able to raise his head high and face others.

He attacked madly, but Little Terror was a Battle Beast. The heaven and earth had given rise to it purely for the sake of battle. There was no need for it to learn anything else at all in future. It only had to act on its instincts.

The little guy had a tough hide, practically reaching the height of Eight Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal, which could more or less ignore Sihuang Yun’s attacks, yet its attacks were incredibly harsh. As its tiny claws flourished, Sihuang Yun’s defense melted like snow that had encountered fire.

This naturally made Sihuang Yun extremely uncomfortable, and he continuously evaded, appearing very battered and exhausted.

Only now did the Empress and the others truly know how powerful Little Terror could be. They were all stunned, and even Hu Niu was pouting. Though she was an Eleventh Secret Monarch Star, with her battle prowess comparable to Small Accomplishment of the Ascending Origin Tier, she was not just a bit away from being capable of matching an opponent at Great Accomplishment of the Ascending Origin Tier.

There were three levels in the Ascending Origin Tier, but there was a massive gap between each level. Even a monarch tier could only be invincible in a battle of equal cultivation levels. Only a Monarch Star could overcome the gap in cultivation level and crush a superior opponent.

But Hu Niu had not advanced to the Ascending Origin Tier yet, so she could only vanquish all those at Small Accomplishment level of the Ascending Origin Tier.

“Niu will work hard on cultivation, and advance into the Ascending Origin Tier as soon as possible, then eat meat!” This glutton’s fiery fighting spirit was immediately ignited. For the sake of eating, she could suffer.

Sihuang Yun roared in fury. He really could not suppress Little Terror. The little guy was a born war machine, a tool for bloodshed. Acting cute was definitely not its strength.

“Stop!” he shouted. If they continued fighting, he would lose, and it would be a terrible defeat.

Ling Han merely chuckled, and did not say a word, having absolutely zero intention to call a halt to events.

Huai Jian, too, crossed his arms over his chest, acting like he had not heard anything.

Monarch Stars like them all had great pride. Sihuang Yun actually dared to treat them so lightly, which naturally made them very displeased. How could they not let him have a little suffering?

When the robes covering Sihuang Yun’s arms and thighs had all become torn and tattered, only then did Huai Jian say to Ling Han, “Brother Ba, that’s about enough, right?”

Ling Han was still not satisfied. Sending out a thought, Little Terror immediately stopped attacking, and leaped backwards to return. It then curled up again in Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms, as obedient as if it was a dog.

Sihuang Yun panted harshly. Now, he was really battered and exhausted. His initially lavish robes were now torn and tattered; he looked no different than a beggar.

He glared harshly at Little Terror, which was immediately sensed by the creature, and the latter glared back angrily at him. Its mouth was again opened, revealing two rows of tiny fangs. Sihuang Yun turned his head, and looked towards Ling Han.

This was the real culprit!

“If you want to become Master’s disciple, are you just going to depend on this beast pet?” he demanded proudly. He could lose a battle, but definitely could not lose face. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han couldn’t help but grin. “What is it? Are you jealous that I have something you don’t?”

Sihuang Yun humphed. He was a man that was destined to become an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King. Would he care about a mere beast pet? But it could not be denied that this beast pet was really very frightening. He was already a Monarch Star himself, yet was still no match for this beast pet. Was this little guy going to defy the heavens?

“Fight me, and if you can parry 100 moves from me, I will inform exalted Master of your arrival!” He stated his condition.

Huai Jian flew into a rage. He was also a very proud man, and had always kept his word. He said that he would make introductions for Ling Han, yet the other man was obstructing them in all form and manner, and established conditions. This was an insult to him.

Was he trying to take them a notch down?

His eyes narrowed. On this matter, he was in the same boat as Ling Han.

“Sihuang Yun, do you even have face? Ba is only an Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf, yet you are a Ninth Lotus First Leaf. How is he supposed to fight you?” he shouted.

Yet Sihuang Yun showed absolutely no hint of embarrassment, and stated calmly, “I do not demand that he defeat me. It is merely parrying 100 strikes. If he can’t do even that, what right does he have to become Master’s disciple?”

“I will fight with you!” Huai Jian declared.

“You?” Sihuang Yun chuckled. “If you can parry 100 strikes from me, you naturally can also go to meet Master, but you cannot substitute for him!” He pointed at Ling Han.

Ling Han said smilingly, “I hate it the most when others point their finger at me.”

“So what about it?” Sihuang Yun demanded arrogantly.

“Then I’ll just close the doors, and let the dog out!” With a thought from Ling Han, Ling Terror immediately charged out again, and pounced at Sihuang Yun.

Peng, peng, peng.?The moment the little guy was in battle, it was crazy. It would be ripping, biting, and chewing, completely aiming to dismember Sihuang Yun.

“You are shameless!” Sihuang Yun hurriedly dodged left and right. He was deliberately bullying Ling Han, wanting to use his superior advantage of a major tier to deal with the latter, but he had not expected that Ling Han would not be falling for it at all. Instead, the latter had Little Terror step out in his place, which instantly made him feel very wounded.

Pieces of fabric flew and scattered, and there was less and less cloth covering Sihuang Yun. What should or should not be revealed was all exposed.

Furthermore, Little Terror had also bitten his legs and behind a few times. Its teeth marks were distinct, and blood was dripping as Sihuang Yun continuously let out yowls of pain.

Actually, he was not someone with a weak will. Even if his bones broke and tendons tore, he would not even frown, but now his behind was being bitten by a wild beast. This feeling was completely different.

Moreover, Little Terror’s teeth were really too sharp, causing bone-deep pain with every bite.

“Hahahaha, Junior Brother Sihuang Yun, why do you look so battered?” Amidst a laugh, another person walked out. However, this time it was a youth of the Angel Race. Similarly, a Ninth Lotus was clear on his forehead; he was also a First Leaf.

Sihuang Yun was tired from dodging, and could not even muster up the strength to refute him. However, his face was flushed red in extreme embarrassment and fury.

This angel smiled at Huai Jian, and said, “Junior Brother Huai Jian, I am Feng Hailuan, exalted Master’s 32nd disciple.”

“Greetings, Senior Brother Feng!” Huai Jian also cupped his fists to pay respects.

Feng Hailuan looked at Little Terror with envy. “So this is the gift that exalted Master has bestowed on Junior Brother? Even I am envious.”

He had heard of Primordial Battle Beasts before. Though he was also very tempted, and wanted to possess one, would he dare speak of this to the Heavenly Venerate?

Realization dawned on Huai Jian. No wonder Sihuang Yun had verbally caused trouble for them from the very beginning. As it turned out, the reason lay here.

Jealousy!

He smirked coldly in his heart. A great Monarch Star would actually spend his energy on fits of jealousy; how was he then to ascend to the pinnacle of cultivation? No wonder the Heavenly Venerate could not cultivate another Heavenly Venerate from his disciples. Part of the reason was that these disciples had focused their efforts on contending for his favor.

If they had a determination to become a Heavenly Venerate, what need would there be to be concerned about external factors like a Battle Beast?

After becoming a Heavenly Venerate, what could they not obtain?

Huai Jian shook his head with a smile, and replied, “This Battle Beast is not mine, but rather belongs to Brother Ba.”

“En?” Feng Hailuan was surprised before showing a hint of displeasure. “What our exalted master has bestowed on Junior Brother, Junior Brother has actually passed on to another?”

‘F***, you are really too generous. Not even I have something so precious. Even if you had wanted to pass it to someone else, you should have passed it to another disciple of Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. What do you mean by giving it to an outsider?’

“That’s not it,” Huai Jian said with a smile. “This is what Brother Ba has won with his own abilities.”

He related the matter of the battle for the first place of the Elite Leaderboard, and admitted frankly that he had indeed lost to Ling Han, though the gap between them was really pitifully small.

Feng Hailuan’s eyes lit up. “Ba, right? Let us have a battle, and if you lose, you will have to give this Battle Beast over to me!”
