Chapter 2268: Handing over

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At present, the neutral zone was indeed capable of stopping the Foreign Realm from invading, but if a Heavenly Venerate interfered, he would be able to easily destroy it.

Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan had not lied. Even if this neutral zone was destroyed, and shook the connecting point of the two Realms, at most it would only be several tens of billions of years. That was indeed a very long time, but it was far from enough to produce a Heavenly Venerate.

But an epoch was different. It was possible that an astonishing variable would appear.

Thus, even those Celestial Kings that had previously felt sympathy for Ling Han were tempted, and felt that Ling Han should sacrifice himself for the sake of the Celestial Realm.

“Hand over Han Lin!” A voice rang out in the Clear Heaven Pass. It was not known who had spoken, and it became louder and louder, drawing echoes from countless others, and turning into an ocean of voices.

The Clear Heaven Pass was very unique. There were no mountains or rivers in the city, only many, many soldier camps filled with people. Thus, the sound spread further and further, and there would not be any dead end, drawing the echoes from more and more people, all calling Ling Han’s name. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Previously, they had all been cheering, and at this moment, they were so impatient to hand Ling Han over in exchange for peace. Ling Han experienced a feeling that he did not know how to describe, feeling torn between laughter and tears. He was just like a princess of some smaller countries in a small world. All the citizens were hoping that he could be offered up in a matrimonial alliance, sacrificing himself to help the majority. But why was it he that had to be sacrificed? Who had asked his opinion? Moreover, so what if there was an epoch of peace? Without getting rid of the root of the problem, they would still have to suffer being invaded by the Foreign Realm after an epoch. Furthermore, why would Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan be so generous? The Origin Magic Cube was probably quite helpful for Foreign Realm elites as well.

That was right. This contained the Regulations of the Celestial Realm as well. If the Foreign Realm elites managed to comprehend them, they might be able to find a way to avoid being targeted by the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm. By then, they would penetrate deeply into the Celestial Realm, and there would really be absolutely no hope left for the Celestial Realm

For the Celestial Realm, the true barrier was actually not Clear Heaven Pass, nor the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, nor any Heavenly Venerate, but rather the heaven and earth itself.

What a joke. Now, there were too many people that had been blinded by an epoch of peace, and could not even cast their sight further. “I propose that Han Lin be handed over,” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King spoke up.

The Celestial Kings’ expressions all changed. No matter how loudly the common people called out, they were just common people, but it was different now that a Celestial King had spoken. This had truly brought the matter up to the table for discussion.

And what was more of a mockery? They had actually summoned Ling Han to praise him, so how had it now become a discussion of whether he should be handed over to the Foreign Realm or not?

At this moment, no one spoke.

Celestial Kings naturally prized their pride. Even if the majority had already agreed internally, they were not willing to express it, and only wanted to bluff things over.

“I disagree!” The Eternity Celestial King appreciated Ling Han’s talent the most. Previously, he had already confronted the Imperial Void Celestial King directly, and now he similarly was defending Ling Han to his best efforts. Ling Han was very touched by this. To be frank, the Eternity Celestial King was completely no family or personal friend of his.

“This boy has astonishing natural talent for cultivation, and also possesses the Origin Magic Cube. There is a very large possibility he could become a Heavenly Venerate.”

“Brother Eternity...” another Celestial King said. “It is uncertain whether this boy can become a Heavenly Venerate, and even if he could, that would only happen at least one or two epochs later. However, if we do not deliver this boy tomorrow, the Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm will destroy the neutral zone. By then, will this boy still have any hopes of becoming a Heavenly Venerate?”

The Eternity Celestial King was displeased, and replied, “If the neutral zone was destroyed, Han Lin would only lose a world, but the Origin Magic Cube would not be destroyed due to that. He could still study the secrets of the heaven and earth through it.” “Eternity, it is just a few tens of billions of years. Is that enough?” a Celestial King that was built completely out of metal asked. His voice was also like metal scraping against metal, sharp and shrill.

“No!” The Eternity Celestial King shook his head, and did not exaggerate. That was too optimistic, and he deduced things realistically. “Without several trillion years, even an epoch’s time would not be enough.”

“But if worse came to worst, we would just be guarding here like usual. The connecting point of the two Realms is far from attaining stability, and there is no way that a Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm can come over!”

With these words, quite a few Celestial Kings seemed persuaded. Though their defense was really very difficult now, hadn’t Clear Heaven Pass still stood firmly without collapsing? Then, if they continued to stand guard for several trillion years more, or even an epoch, they would be more able to win a future that was filled with hope for the Celestial Realm. “I still think we should hand him over,” the Heavy Metal Celestial King said. His title was Heavy Metal, and he was also a veteran Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

“In that case, let’s vote.” The Eternity Celestial King did not bother to waste words. “Those who agree on handing over Han Lin, raise your hand.”

When these words fell, the Heavy Metal Celestial King was the first to raise his hand, and then more Celestial Kings raised their hands as well.

The Eternity Celestial King swept over a glance, and was instantly reassured.

The number of Celestial Kings that agreed to hand Ling Han over was less than half.

“Could it be that we should not consider the public sentiment of Clear Heaven Pass?” the Celestial King of Shen Clan suddenly said.

“That’s right. The public sentiment could be supportive or opposing. If we did not have the support of these troops, the Celestial Realm would have no qualified successors to carry on the undertaking. How then would we be able to continue sustaining wave after wave of assault from the Foreign Realm?” the Celestial Kings that agreed to hand over Ling Han all said.

The Eternity Celestial King sneered. Usually, in the eyes of these Celestial Kings, even Ascending Origin Tiers were mere ants to them, and they did not deign to even cast a second look at them, and now they were actually talking about public sentiment. How utterly shameless.

He was just about to speak, but weng, a frightening divine sense assailed them, as heavy as a mountain and astonishingly terrifying.

So what if they were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? They all experienced a feeling of helplessness.

An eye was the first to appear, and then a face was squeezed out in the skies. Instantly, that majestic aura raised to another level.

“Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable!” a considerable number of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings exclaimed softly, bearing complicated expressions.

The Heavenly Venerable Tier, the strongest power of a Realm, but the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had not done anything for the Celestial Realm, and only acted as if the invasion of the Foreign Realm did not exist. How could that not be disappointing?

But who would dare rebuke him frankly? They did not even dare to discuss the matter privately

“Greetings, milord!” All the Celestial Kings paid their respects.

Ling Han glanced longer at him. The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was stately in bearing, and looked to be in his twenties. His eyes were the brightest, just like the eyes of the heavens, and were seemingly capable of seeing the whole heaven and earth.

“I decree that this boy is to be handed over in exchange for peace of an epoch for the Celestial Realm,” the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable said, and that face rapidly dispersed.

He had let his divine sense descend merely to say these words. “Eternity, you have heard clearly. Lord Sealed Emotion has already decreed it!” the Heavy Metal Celestial King exclaimed.

A Heavenly Venerate had personally commanded it, so it was naturally a sure bet that Ling Han would be handed over. No one could possibly change that. The Eternity Celestial King’s fists clenched tightly, his eyes sweeping over them. Most of the Celestial Kings that had previously supported him had lowered their heads by now. Clearly, they did not dare to oppose a Heavenly Venerate.

Who would have that courage?

“Since that is the case, apprehend this boy,” the Heavy Metal Celestial King stated calmly. He naturally would not deign to make a move on a mere Immortal Palace Tier.

The Celestial King of the Shen Clan leaped out. He would be very pleased to do the job.

“Hahahaha!” Ling Han suddenly burst out laughing, wild and mad to the point of being completely unreserved, causing every Celestial King to turn and look at him.

“Brat, this is not the neutral zone. You are only a mere mortal,” the Celestial King of the Shen Clan declared coldly.

“Is that right?”
