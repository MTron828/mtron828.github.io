Chapter 1160: Counterattack from the Weak

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Hao was brimming with confidence, and he said, “Although your power is on par with mine, you have to realize that power is only one part of battle prowess!”

His words couldn’t be truer. The Lion Seal could raise Ling Han’s power, yet it couldn’t raise his speed or defenses. Moreover, his grasp of the Regulations of heaven and earth also remained at the Mountain River Tier.

Thus, there was still a huge gulf between him and Yang Hao.

Yang Hao’s strike just then had only been a casual one. Although he had used power at the Sun Moon Tier, he hadn’t channeled the corresponding Regulations. However, he didn’t hold back anymore, and he unleashed a boundless might that fluctuated throughout the surroundings. It was as if a great emperor had descended onto this mountain peak.

“Suppress him!” Yang Hao threw a punch, and the brilliant divine patterns that burst from his hand made it seem as if heaven and earth were colorless.

Ling Han fell into a frantic retreat. He merely possessed enough power to defend against Yang Hao’s attacks. However, his grasp of Regulations was far inferior to his opponent’s.

He drew his Divine Demon Sword, a cold expression on his face.

He had to make the most of his strengths. If he simply battled against Yang Hao head-on, his only fate would be to suffer defeat.

“You still won’t yield to me?” Yang Hao raised a hand, and the gigantic Origin Power hand reappeared in the air. It grabbed at Ling Han, and this time, the hand was engraved with a multitude of divine patterns. This was certainly not a hand that could be shattered with a single strike.

Ling Han unleashed his Lightning Sword Technique.

Xiu!

His speed was incredible, and with the support of more power, he could destroy Regulations to a greater extent. However, his physique still lagged behind.

Pa, pa, pa!

Following his lightning-quick dash, at least a dozen of his bones snapped, while his skin and flesh cracked open. Blood sprayed through the air.

A magnificent strike slashed over.

Yang Hao was slightly astonished. He raised his hand to his face, only to see a streak of blood appear on his hand.

Ling Han’s strike had actually wounded him—it had left a tiny scratch on his face.

This was merely an insignificant wound, yet Yang Hao couldn’t stand to accept this.

He was genuinely an invincible king tier, and his cultivation level was far above that of Ling Han. Yet, he had actually been cut by his opponent. This was utter humiliation!

Although Ling Han had cut Yang Hao with his sword, his situation was far direr than Yang Hao’s. His body was soaked in blood, and it was as if he had been trampled hundreds of times. However, Yang Hao knew that he hadn’t hurt Ling Han at all. Rather, Ling Han’s wounds were caused by him not being able to withstand the overwhelming power of his own strike.

In other words, he had lost this exchange!

‘I severely underestimated him,’ Yang Hao thought to himself.

He stood serious and unmoving, yet streaks of crimson light burst from his body. The might of the crimson light was so profound that everyone present was unable to breathe. It was as if a formidable ancient beast were about to appear from his body.

He lashed out again, this time striking with his palm.

Ling Han wanted to unleash his Fast Technique, yet he was shocked to find that his movements had been sealed.

‘Is this Yang Hao’s secret technique?’

Boom!

Yang Hao’s palm struck over, and a giant crater was smashed into the mountain peak. Meanwhile, Ling Han vomited several mouthfuls of blood as he was sent flying by the strike.

He had already activated the Vajra Seal upon realizing the dire nature of his situation. If he hadn’t done so, vomiting blood would have been the least of his worries, because there wouldn’t have been a single piece of unbroken bone in his body!

“Huh? It looks like you own quite a lot of valuable items!” Yang Hao exclaimed in surprise. A mere Mountain River Tier cultivator was actually able to struggle on and withstand his strikes with the help of two divine seals. This was truly astounding.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and rapidly healed the broken bones in his body. He didn’t bother to heal his flesh wounds. When his broken bones were close to being fully healed, he laughed loudly, and said, “What does that have to do with you? Yang Hao, eat my sword!”

He unleashed his Lightning Sword Technique again. There was a cold glint, and his strike was like an immortal swooping down from beyond the sky.

Yang Hao was prepared this time, and he crossed his arms before his body. At the same time, strands of Regulations formed divine chains that crisscrossed before his body and acted as a shield.

Ling Han let out a loud roar. He had already activated the Vajra Seal, so his defenses had also reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. As such, he could destroy Regulations without inflicting wounds upon his own body.

There was a flash, and his sword slashed through the criss-cross of divine chains. Specks of blood flew through the air.

A dark expression fell across Yang Hao’s face. He had been wounded again. The wound was only on his hand, and like before, it wasn’t very deep.

However, he had been wounded twice. Twice by the same person. In his eyes, this was utterly unacceptable!

If Ling Han were at the Heavenly Body Tier, he would have nothing to say. However, the key was that he wasn’t. A mere Mountain River Tier cultivator had wounded him twice in quick succession—this was absolutely absurd!

Yang Hao was seething with rage, and his boundless anger transformed into a sea of flames. He lashed out again, making a pressing motion with his hand. A dark cloud instantly gathered above Ling Han’s head.

Crackle... Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Flashes of lightning arced across the sky. Yang Hao had actually summoned the power of lightning!

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this. Yang Hao was far too terrifying! He could actually summon the power of lightning!

Boom!

Like a dance of silver snakes, countless arcs of lightning struck at Ling Han.

Although Ling Han was still standing when the dark clouds dissipated, his clothes were already ripped and tattered. Large swathes of his skin were also charred, and it was almost as if he had become a big lump of coal.

If it weren’t for the Vajra Seal, it was very likely that he would have been killed by this strike.

Ling Han used his divine sense to communicate with the Rain Emperor and Ding Ping, warning them not to come over to try and help him in battle. Their strength was far inferior to Yang Hao’s, so it would be foolish for them to step out in a spur of the moment act.

Anyhow, he was quite puzzled at this moment. The sect clearly had a rule against disciples at a higher cultivation level attacking those at a lower cultivation level. However, their intense battle had already gone on for quite some time. He refused to believe that no higher-ups of the sect had noticed them.

However, they didn’t step forward to put a stop to the battle even though they were aware of it. What was the meaning of this?

Ling Han’s body swayed. Then, he couldn’t help but spit out another mouthful of blood.

He wasn’t a genuine Sun Moon Tier cultivator, after all, so he was naturally at a massive disadvantage when battling against a prodigy such as Yang Hao.

However, no one looked down on him because of this. Quite the contrary, in fact—they all felt a deep sense of admiration for him. He was an absolute freak! He was able to exchange blows with Yang Hao, and he had even managed to wound him twice!

If their cultivation levels were the same... Ling Han would genuinely possess the ability to obliterate Yang Hao’s legend of invincibility!

“Can you still continue?” Yang Hao asked with a cold chuckle. He didn’t feel any shame for picking on the weak. In his eyes, he was merely trampling an ant to death. As such, was there any need for him to take this to heart?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Why not?”

His fighting spirit raged, and it reverberated loudly in his heart.

Yang Hao humphed in displeasure. In reality, he dearly hoped that Ling Han would submit to him. Even though Ling Han was weaker than him, admitting defeat would still leave mental trauma in his mind. If their cultivation levels became the same in the future, Ling Han’s trauma would give Yang Hao a mental edge should they ever face off again.

However, Ling Han was far more resilient than he had expected, and this caused him to feel some heat.

He enjoyed a great deal of special treatment in the sect, yet this still didn’t give him the freedom to kill people as he wished. The main reason he was able to target Ling Han was because there was a reason for him to do so—his follower had been killed by Ling Han, after all. The higher-ups of the sect would allow him to let off some steam, but... they definitely wouldn’t allow him to kill other disciples.

There were some bottom lines that couldn’t be traversed.

Anyhow, Ling Han was also a supreme prodigy, so the sect definitely held high hopes for him. Another reason they let Yang Hao off the hook was because they wanted to take the edge off Ling Han’s spirit. They didn’t want him to become too arrogant.

‘Fine, I’ll utterly defeat this youth and give him an unforgettable lesson. I’ll crush him so thoroughly that he’ll feel afraid every time he sees me in the future.’

Yang Hao moved his arms, and divine chains danced through the air.
