Chapter 3571: Resolved

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

If it was not for the fact that he had advanced into Celestial Path, even if the Eldest imperial Prince had an Innate Divine Physique, he would not feel such intimidating pressure.

The Eldest Imperial Prince humphed, “Ling Han, you are really outrageously bold. There are so many Imperial Princes inviting you to resign, and you still intend to resist stubbornly? Could it be that you do not know that this imperial throne would ultimately fall on the shoulders of one of us Imperial Princes, yet you do not listen to commands. Is that the way of a subject?” Ling Han chuckled, “Under the command of His Majesty, I am in charge of the Foreign Affairs Department. All matters relating to the sects have to pass through my hands. The Imperial Princes have frequently gone to those sects to freeload, and tarnished the reputation of the Majestic Empire. How could I possibly ignore these actions?”

“That is still no reason for you to detain an Imperial Prince!” the Eldest Imperial Prince declared harshly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Of course, it is. How can one rule the world without strict laws? Moreover, His Majesty is still sitting on the throne at present, and has not passed on the throne into the hands of Your Imperial Highnesses yet. Thus, if you want to shout at me, you all had best wait a few more years.

F***, what right did this guy have to be so arrogant?

The imperial Princes almost exploded in fury. ‘You’re only a subject, so why do you act like you’re the emperor’s father?’

From a certain aspect, Ling Han was truly the emperor’s father. After all, he was a rank higher than Chen Fengyan in hierarchy.

The Eldest Imperial Prince had lost all patience, “Ling Han, I had initially thought very highly of you, but you have disappointed me too much now!” He stretched out a hand, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

No matter how freakish Ling Han was, in front of an elite of Celestial Path, he

was nothing but trash. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Peng!

A silvery light flashed past, and a figure flew over at an extraordinarily fast speed, blocking this blow for Ling Han.

“Bixiao?” the Imperial Princes all exclaimed in astonishment. The person who had blocked this attack for Ling Han was none other than Princess Bixiao. Her alluring figure was hidden within the dazzling silver Battle Armor, adding a heroic air to her.

Even if the Imperial Princes were people who had seen the world, their hearts still beat wildly when they saw this exquisite beauty.

Princess Bixiao withdrew her hand, and said calmly, “Your Imperial Highnesses, you publicly attacked the Foreign Affairs Department. Are you planning to cause a rebellion against His Imperial Majesty?”

This… the Imperial Princes were all speechless. They had only come for their own benefit, so how had this become a rebellion?

“The Foreign Affairs Department was personally established by His Majesty.

You all came to our doors, and first, you publicly broke out a prisoner, and now you want to gang up on the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department. Bixiao can only assume that the Imperial Princes are deliberately opposing His Majesty,” Princess Bixiao said calmly.

■’Bixiao, are you protecting this person?” the Seventh Imperial Prince asked, his expression dark.

To say nothing of him, all the Imperial Princes’ expressions were ugly.

Princess Bixiao had been sent here by the Demon Race as a betrothal partner, and the partner should be one of the Imperial Princes like them. Now, she was actually having an ambiguous relationship with a rebellious subject, which made them feel like they were being cuckolded.

This could not be tolerated.

“Bixiao, are you determined to go your own way?” the Eldest Imperial Prince asked darkly.

“It is not Bixiao that is going my own way, but rather does Your Imperial Highnesses have to be so overbearing?” Princess Bixiao countered.

The Eldest Imperial Prince withdrew the last bit of compassion that he had for the fairer sex. Beautiful women were indeed good, but compared with the privileges that an Imperial Prince had, even a beautiful woman had to step aside. Otherwise, what difference did they have with commoners?

“Then don’t blame me for being impolite!” he said coldly. An incredibly dazzling green starlight appeared behind him.

He activated the might of his Divine Physique, and his battle prowess would be greatly increased.

“Go!” The Eldest Imperial Prince pointed at Princess Bixiao, and instantly, a streak of cyan starlight shot towards Princess Bixiao.

Princess Bixiao stretched out her palm and delivered a palm strike. Pa, this streak of starlight was annihilated, but under the impact of the terrifying wave, the whole hall instantly collapsed.

Everyone hurriedly fled. Dust flew into the air, and the scene was chaotic to the extreme.

Ling Han humphed, “Bixiao, you take down this big one, and leave the rest to me!”

He was angered. He had not even gone to make trouble for these Imperial Princes, and they had already dismantled his Foreign Affairs Department. This could not be tolerated.

“All right!” Princess Bixiao said. With the Battle Armor on her, even if the Eldest Imperial Prince had an Innate Divine Physique, so what? She was unafraid. Moreover, she had also used a top grade Divine Stone to build her Foundation. In terms of mystical power, she should be stronger than the Eldest Imperial Prince.

The Eldest Imperial Prince was astonished. The attack that he had launched with the might of his Divine Physique had actually been so easily dispersed by Princess Bixiao?

This was an Innate Divine Physique. Even if it was the lowest grade, it was still a Divine Physique, high and noble. When he was born, he had even triggered the phenomenon of heaven and earth. How could this be so easily dealt with?

Yet Princess Bixiao took advantage of the opening to counterattack. The Battle Armor had increased her power by a whole tenfold, and could match an elite of Heavenly Dao Foundation, so how could it be compared with the Eldest Imperial Prince, who had just advanced into Celestial Path?

However, this also showed how terrifying the Divine Physique was. The Eldest Imperial Prince continuously blasted out starlight, and actually managed to hold on for a short period of time.

If that wasn’t the case, the Divine Physique would be too cheap!

Only after advancing into the Celestial Path did the Divine Physique truly show its brilliance. The Eldest Imperial Prince had not been this powerful when he had a Mystery Realm Tier.

However, the Eldest Imperial Prince could only hold on for the moment. The might of the Divine Physique could not possibly be channelled continuously. The moment he relaxed the slightest bit, he would definitely be unable to withstand the might of the Battle Armor.

Xiu, right at this moment, light flashed, and a human figure that was completely made up of patterns of light appeared.

The Formation Spirit.

“On one side are the subjects of the Emperor, and on the other side are the Imperial Princes, yet you’re fighting in the Imperial Capital. Don’t you guys feel ashamed?” the Formation Spirit shouted.

Princess Bixiao and the Eldest Imperial Prince hurriedly stopped. From a certain aspect, the Formation Spirit was the embodiment of Chen Fengyan.

“Eldest, even you are muddled, to actually attack the Foreign Affairs Department?” the Formation Spirit shouted at the Eldest Imperial Prince.

“Imperial Father, listen to my explanation!” The Eldest Imperial Prince hurriedly defended himself, “Ling Han had detained Seventh Brother without permission, and that was too humiliating. We could not contain our fury, and that was why we came up with such a plan.”

“Hmph, you guys go and freeload off of the sects that surrendered. The Foreign Affairs Department has already reported this to me. I already said that these forces would be dealt with by the Foreign Affairs Department, and you guys are still acting so self-righteously by rashly interfering?” the Formation Spirit said in displeasure.

“From today onwards, all of you stay in the Imperial City, and reflect on your errors behind closed doors. Within three years, you are not allowed to take a single step out of your doors.”

“Understood!” All the Imperial Princes replied respectfully. This was the ruler of a nation, and was more so a Spirit Transformation True Lord. His words were a Saintly Decree.

The Formation Spirit’s eyes swept over, but did not stop on Ling Han. Instead, it directly slid over, and stopped on Princess Bixiao, “Since you have advanced into Celestial Path, I shall bestow upon you the title of Princess Bixiao of the Majestic Empire as a reward.”

“Thank you, Your Majesty.” Princess Bixiao curtsied.

Previously, though she was a princess, she was a princess of the Demon Race. In the Imperial Capital, people would only address her as princess out of respect for her. Otherwise, she was no different from an ordinary person.

But now, she was a genuine princess of the Dark North Nation.

With a wave of the Formation Spirit’s hand, it suddenly turned into a ball of shattered light that disappeared without a trace.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. Chen Fengyan had actually deliberately ignored him?

True, in terms of seniority, he was Chen Fengyan’s uncle. Even if Chen Fengyan had already said that they would address each other on their own terms, it was still a little awkward..
