Chapter 2565: Extremely shameless

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The tournament had strict rules against faked battles. Once such cases were discovered, the involved parties would all be executed.

Because the owner of this tournament ground was the Azure Ghost Celestial King, who would dare challenge his authority?

Previously, there had been a son of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King who had told his subordinate to fight a faked battle for the sake of his gambling stakes, and in the end, this person was directly killed by the Azure Ghost Celestial King, who did not give any face to his old man at all.

After this, there was no other profligate young master that dared order their subordinates to fight fake battles.

Now, this veteran fighter was asking Ling Han for mercy, but this was not about fighting a fake battle, but rather him hoping that Ling Han could spare his life in the case that he lost.

Ling Han smiled calmly. He was not a psychotic murderer, and did not have the hobby of definitely killing his opponents. “No problem.”

“Thank you,” the veteran gladiator said, smiling.

Looking at the stage.

“Hehe, Hu Jing is using this trick again.”

“This guy is the most treacherous. He has deceived a great many people into thinking that he was docile and honest, yet in the end, he would suddenly turn around and attack fiercely, their lives taken easily.”

“This pretty boy should have fallen for it as well.”

“Hehe, what is the use of great strength? Without being clever enough, he would still be going to his death.”

“It can’t be helped. He’s a newcomer, and doesn’t know that one has to be cruel to survive here. Once you attack, you must definitely show no mercy, or you would merely be courting death.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Those who had watched long enough naturally knew the kind of character this veteran fighter was.

“Young man, let me teach you something.” Hu Jing acted as if he was going to speak to Ling Han, and when he came close enough, he suddenly attacked furiously. A flash of saber light shot skywards. He was indeed as everyone had said: extremely treacherous.

All the words that he had said previously were merely for the sake of numbing Ling Han, and all of it was just paving the path for this strike.

A cold smirk curled up the corners of his lips. Why was it very rare for him to battle on the tournament ground now? That was because this trick would no longer be useful if he used it too often. Thus, it was necessary that he come out again and try this dirty trick after an interval of time, when everyone had more or less forgotten about him.

With how treacherous he was, he naturally had already come up with a way out for himself. If Ling Han was truly extremely strong, and even such a sudden sneak attack was not able to wound him, he would retreat immediately.

There was a safe passage at the side of the tournament ground. Once he entered into this passage, the tournament battle would be halted.

Though Ling Han had not taken this opponent to heart, once the battle had started, he would definitely not be careless. Furthermore, his strength had really surpassed his opponent’s by too far. The moment his opponent’s saber swiped out towards him, the saber light had not even struck him, and he had already reacted, throwing his fist out in a punch.

Peng!

Hu Jing felt his hands become numb, and he could not even grip the handle of his saber. He was immediately sent flying.

He paled in shock. He had not thought that his opponent’s strength was so great that it had far surpassed his imagination. Without the slightest bit of hesitation, he immediately broke into a run, and raced towards the safe passage.

With how fast a Celestial King was, he had already drawn close to the passage in a single leap, but right at this moment, a gentle voice rang out next to his ear. “What are you running for?”

Yet when these words were heard by Hu Jing, this was practically as if a spell was pressing him to death, causing goosebumps to rise up all over his body. However, his feet moved even more forcefully, and he was running even faster than before.

Pa, he felt a weight on his shoulder, and he involuntarily stopped.

“Ah!” he roared. A sharp blade suddenly appeared in his hand, and he stabbed it towards Ling Han’s ribs.

“Brother, don’t you think you’re a little too out of line?” Ling Han asked, smiling. With a casual swipe of his, this sharp blade instantly fell into his hand.

Hu Jing was also smiling, but this smile was extremely forced, and looked even worse than if he were crying. “Brother, don’t misunderstand. I was really teaching you something just now. You must definitely keep your guard around certain treacherous villains, who would make use of your kindness.”

This man’s shamelessnes was truly unimaginable.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “How should I deal with this kind of treacherous villain, then?”

Hu Jing’s eyeballs spun around madly. He naturally would not say something like he should kill such people, and immediately declared righteously, “You should teach them well. How could they be so shameless?”

Ling Han shook his head. “I think it would be better to kill them. End the matter once and for all, and save any future trouble.”

“Spare me!” Hu Jing screamed. “I have to support elderly and children. If I die, my whole family will be finished!”

Ling Han was surprised. He already knew that this man was extremely shameless, but he was still shocked by the level he could lower himself to.

Shua, right at this moment, Hu Jing suddenly shot out a leg, a kick directly aimed at the top of Ling Han’s head, and there was a cold light flashing at the tip of his shoe. A sharp blade was actually hidden in the sole of his shoe. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The kick landed, and Hu Jing felt like the sharp blade under his foot had pierced into bone. He was too familiar with this feeling, and had killed who knew how many people with this same move.

He was instantly overjoyed, but he had not managed to break into a smile yet when he suddenly screamed loudly.

That was because this strike of his had pierced onto his own palm. As it turned out, Ling Han had grabbed his right hand somehow, and then used it as a shield in front of his own face, making it bear the stab from his shoe.

Hu Jing was in pain, but was even more panicked. He had used this series of successive final blows, yet Ling Han had still easily dealt with them. This man’s strength was of a level that he could not possibly imagine.

He broke out in a cold sweat. Now that things had come so far, even he could not believe that Ling Han would still be willing to spare him.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Any other tricks?” He was very curious about how many treacherous strikes this guy could think of with his shamelessness.

Hu Jing was speechless. Firstly, he had indeed run out of tricks, and secondly, even if he hadn’t, faced with Ling Han’s absolute strength, even he knew that there was no way they would be effective.

“No more? This is truly disappointing!” Ling Han shook his head, and then raised a fist. “Any more last words that you need me to relay to your family?”

Hu Jing did not have any elders or children. These were just lies he had fabricated. In such dire straits, he also erupted in ferocity, and his right hand that was still free struck towards Ling Han’s eyes, countless chains surging out of his body.

These were chains of Regulations that were manifested by great dao. He had no hopes that he could kill Ling Han; his only hope was that he would be able to cause the latter some injury.

With a casual toss, Ling Han threw Hu Jing out.?Peng, his body suddenly exploded in midair, turning into a shower of blood.

Naturally, there was no way that this kind of treacherous, shameless villain would garner any mercy from Ling Han.

“Li Long wins!” The commentator announced the results loudly.

Everyone was cheering. Both of Ling Han’s victories ended with completely destroying his opponent. This had completely satisfied their yearning to see a merciless, cruel spectacle.

Yet Ling Han showed no hint of happiness. He killed others not because he enjoyed it, but rather just because he thought that the person in question deserved death.

Tang Yuan’s mood also lifted slightly. Ling Han claiming two absolute victories was naturally as he had expected, but such decisive and clean winning still pleasantly surprised him.

‘Quickly claim 10 victories.’ Tang Yuan could not wait to suppress Lu Li. He had suffered too many losses in recent days, and felt like he was about to die from the jeering and mockery of the other profligate young masters that were his equal in status.

In the next few days, Ling Han would battle once about every three days, and they were all one-sided, crushing victories. Moreover, as long as his opponent did not go too far, he would not deliberately take the lives of others, either.

10 days later, Ling Han had already attained five consecutive victories.

At this point, the subsequent battles would not be so easy. The tournament would deliberately target him, and use all possible means available to them to stop him from becoming a Blood Martial King.

This label was an honor, a recognition of strength, so how could it easily be bestowed?

The waiting time this time was slightly longer. 10 days later, Ling Han finally met his sixth opponent.
