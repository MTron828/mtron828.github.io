Chapter 1845: Killed With a Single Strike

Anyhow, Ling Han hadn’t planned on sparing Lin Fang and the others, either. It was just that they had fled quickly enough.

Ling Han stepped forward, and said, “Come, come, come, let’s have a battle. If any of you can withstand three of my strikes, I’ll let you off the hook!” His gaze was locked onto Lin Fang, Teng Sen, and Wei Nian.

Lin Fang and the others wanted to flee, yet they were instantly surrounded by nine female knights in silver armor.

The three of them could only cast hopeful glances toward the elites of their clans. However, these elites all turned around and pretended that they couldn’t see their request for help.

What a joke! Even Zihe Ji had been insta-killed, so wouldn’t they be seeking death if they stepped forward?

Lin Fang and the others exchanged a glance, and said through gritted teeth, “Let’s take a gamble!”

They knew that they were no match for Ling Han. However, if it was only blocking three strikes, it most likely wouldn’t pose too much of a problem.

“Come at me together. I don’t have much time,” Ling Han said calmly. “Three strikes. As long as you can withstand three strikes, I’ll pretend that you’re thin air. I’ll let you off the hook.”

The three of them became even more confident upon hearing this.

After teaming up, could they not block three strikes from Ling Han? Did Ling Han truly think he was a god?!

The female knight in golden armor was also extremely interested. She clasped her hands behind her back, and didn’t tell Ling Han to hurry up.

She knew that the Young Imperial Empress was deeply enchanted by this man.

However, was Ling Han worthy of the Young Imperial Empress?

Thus, she wanted to observe just how powerful Ling Han was. If he were too trashy, she would resolutely kill him, even if that meant being punished or killed by the sect. She would prevent him from ruining the Young Imperial Empress.

Lin Fang and the others chuckled coldly in their minds upon seeing Ling Han standing there and not moving. They exchanged a glance before calmly preparing their most powerful attacks.

Boom, boom, boom!

Radiance of the great dao suddenly erupted from their bodies. As king tiers, they were naturally no pushovers. This was especially the case since they had already advanced to the peak stage of the fourth severance. They were close to invincible in the Severing Mundane Tier.

The three of them were teaming up, and they only needed to block three strikes. They were confident that they could succeed.

The female knight remained silent, so the others naturally didn’t dare to speak, either. Even if they wanted to suck up to her, they could only shut up and watch the show now.

At this moment, Fu Gaoyun and the others had just exited the mystery realm. They weren’t clear about what was happening, but they couldn’t help but click their tongues in wonder upon seeing that Ling Han was about to battle with someone again.

‘How strange! The elites of the Lunar Sect are standing right there, so why aren’t they capturing Ling Han? Why are they allowing him to battle with Lin Fang and the others instead?

‘Huh? Why has Grand Elder Fu Yan also come?’

They hurriedly ran over to ask him about the current situation.

After a short while, they were all stunned by what they heard.

‘Holy f*ck! Ling Han is actually the successor of a Celestial King Tier force!’

A bitter expression spread across Fu Gaoyun’s face. If he had withstood the pressure, he could have been enjoying the fruits of this friendship now. However, he had at least maintained a good relationship with Ling Han. This was a great fortune.

Meanwhile, Fu Xiaoyun was feeling extremely downcast. No wonder the Empress had said that she wasn’t worthy of Ling Han. She had initially viewed herself as having a higher status before, yet compared to Ling Han now, it was clear that she was miles and miles behind him.

Cheng Zhong and the others were also feeling immense regret. They could have grabbed Ling Han’s coattail before, yet they had actually refused to do so! If they were given another chance, they would definitely jump on and ride Ling Han’s coattail!

“His a*s truly wasn’t r*ped? Or else why is his hair still not growing?” Situ Xiaozhen asked. She was still pondering this strange question. It was anyone’s guess how her mind worked.

Ling Han suddenly felt his a*s tighten. At the same time, a cold chill shot down his spine. He couldn’t help but shudder.

“Die!” Lin Fang and the others roared as they unleashed their most powerful attacks at Ling Han.

By actively attacking, they would naturally have a greater chance of withstanding three strikes from Ling Han.

Offense was the best defense, and they had to transform their reactiveness into proactiveness!

Of course, they definitely couldn’t kill Ling Han. In fact, they didn’t even dare to severely wound Ling Han. After all, the overwhelming might of the female knight in golden armor was already deeply imprinted in their minds.

A grin spread across Ling Han’s face as a terrifying aura exuded from his body.

The expressions of the Dividing Soul Tier elites suddenly changed. They were all stunned by what they felt.

This was an incredibly powerful aura. Although it hadn’t reached the Dividing Soul Tier yet, it was already far superior to the peak stage of the fourth severance. Most importantly, Ling Han’s cultivation was only at the peak stage of the third severance! That being the case, how could he unleash such a powerful aura?

Even Sun Zhen felt slightly numb with apprehension. He had initially thought that Ling Han had used some kind of underhanded technique to kill Luo Changfeng. Judging from the current situation, however, Ling Han didn’t need to use any underhanded technique at all.

The female knight in golden armor was also slightly astonished. Although Ling Han was still weaker than Hu Niu at the same cultivation level, the Roc Palace was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. Just how incredible was their potential?

Only after using an exorbitant amount of resources had they raised Hu Niu to where she was now. Meanwhile, Ling Han had no background and no support. He had achieved everything by himself. Yet, even so, he was only slightly weaker than Hu Niu. This was absolutely stunning.

‘No wonder... the Young Imperial Empress is always longing for him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

‘He’s a true prodigy!

‘Although he’s still inferior to the Young Imperial Empress, at least they won’t look too bad together. He just barely qualifies.’

Boom!

Lin Fang and the others charged over, and their attacks were so powerful that it seemed as if they were about to obliterate heaven and earth.

Ling Han shook his head. He then activated his Divine Fetus and fused it together with the fire element Regulations. With this done, he summoned a strike that far exceeded his current cultivation level.

Boom!

A dazzling column of flames burst through the sky before violently exploding and sending currents of chaotic fire-element Regulations into the surroundings. The Dividing Soul Tier elites were forced to activate defensive techniques to block the shock waves of this attack. Otherwise, they would have affected the juniors of their forces.

The power of this attack definitely surpassed the Severing Mundane Tier!

The seniors from the Lin Clan, the Teng Clan, and the Wei Clan all wore bitter expressions. To say nothing of surviving this attack, it was difficult to say whether any piece of flesh of Lin Fang and the others would even remain.

Sure enough, once the flames disappeared, Lin Fang and the others were nowhere to be seen. They had vanished from the world once and for all.

Even before his transformation, Ling Han could have dealt with Lin Fang and the others with ease. Thus, after unleashing the most powerful attack of his Divine Fetus, it was only natural that he could kill his opponents with a single strike. Otherwise, it would have been a complete waste of an eighth heaven Celestial King’s hundreds of millions of years of hard work.

Ling Han clapped his hand before turning around. He then smiled at the female knight in golden armor, and asked, “Senior, can we set off now?”

If he had to cross the boundless seas by himself, his journey would definitely be filled with dangers. However, since this female knight in golden armor had come, it would naturally be much easier for him to cross the boundless seas and enter the Western Celestial Realm. They would face almost no danger.

He certainly didn’t want to experience a deadly accident just moments before he was about to arrive at the Western Celestial Realm and reunite with his wives.

The female knight in golden armor pondered for a moment before saying, “No problem!”

She swept her gaze across the surroundings, and everyone involuntarily lowered their heads. They didn’t dare to make eye contact with her. Even Sun Zhen was no exception.

They were both at the fifth secret, yet this female knight possessed a battle prowess that was numerous times more powerful than his. He couldn’t rival her at all.

Right now, there was only a single thought in his mind: he would return to the battleship as soon as possible such that he could activate its cannons and blast this woman to death.

“Humph! Plotting something sinister? Die!” A murderous aura suddenly appeared in the female knight’s eyes as she launched a palm strike at Sun Zhen.

Sun Zhen was both astonished and enraged. ‘I’m only f*cking considering this right now, and I haven’t actually acted on it! Yet, you’re actually targeting me for this? What the f*ck?!’

However, since she had already launched an attack, he had no choice but to react. Otherwise, he would be inviting death.

He didn’t dare to block her attack, so he shot back in retreat instead. At the same time, he shouted, “Friend, don’t misunderstand me!”
