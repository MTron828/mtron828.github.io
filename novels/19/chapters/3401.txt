Chapter 3402: A jade seed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Bao Taigong thought for a moment. There was no way he would lose, so he was not afraid even if he had to bet his life.

“Alright, I’ll bet my life with you!” He slammed the table.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Your life isn’t worth much, and I wouldn’t want it even if you gave it to me! Sigh, if you don’t know how to speak, then I can still slaughter you as food, but since you can speak, how can I eat you?” F*ck, you can’t eat me, and that’s my fault?

Wait, how could I lose?

Bao Taigong was enraged, and said, “Ling Han, you’re clearly the one who’s afraid of losing!”

Ling Han sighed, and asked, “Do you have a Treasured Fruit?”

“No.” Bao Taigong shook his head subconsciously.

Then how many jade seeds do you have?”

More than 10,000.” Bao Taigong was being manipulated again.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Since you don’t have a Treasured Fruit or jade seeds, and I can’t eat you even if I killed you, what use do I have for you?” Bao Taigong was stunned for a moment, and then he was so angry that smoke was coming out of his seven orifices. So Ling Han was still teasing him? He thought for a moment, and said, “Alright, I’ll bet my Leopard Clan’s ultimate technique, Floating Wind and Clouds, with you.”

“Brother Bao!”

“Brother Bao!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The two Demon Race members beside him hurriedly shouted with anxious expressions.

“The Floating Wind and Clouds movement technique is a secret technique of the Leopard Clan. It can’t be imparted to outsiders, let alone a human.”

Bao Taigong snorted and said unhappily, “Do you think I’ll lose?”

“Of course not, but-” The two men hesitated.

“Since I won’t lose, so what if the bet is big?” Bao Taigong said coldly. Then, he slammed the table heavily again, and said to Ling Han, “How about it?” Ling Han was astounded. ‘How did you know that I’m currently lacking a movement technique? This was his bosom friend!’

Seeing Ling Han’s stunned expression, Bao Taigong thought that Ling Han’s cleverness had backfired on him. Ling Han must have originally thought that he would be intimidated by some kind of bet, but he did not expect that he would actually dare to take the offer, and directly stop Ling Han from retreating.

He couldn’t help but sneer, and said, “I’ve already declared my stakes, so you don’t dare?”

“Sure.” Ling Han stood up. “If you only wanted to be beaten up, I wouldn’t be bothered to waste my energy. However, since there’s a movement technique that I can take a look at, I can do it reluctantly.”

Bao Taigong was furious. The battle hadn’t even started and you’re already saying that I’m no match for you?

He did not flare up. Since Ling Han had already agreed to the challenge, he could completely vent his anger in the battle later.

“Come on.” He strode off, about to step out into the empty courtyard.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “That won’t do. You have to bring out the stakes first. How do I know if you won’t admit your loss after losing?” “Alright!” Bao Taigong only hoped that Ling Han would fight now, and everything else could be compromised.

“Then let’s invite Your Highness to be the witness,” Ling Han said with a smile It just so happened that he caught a glimpse of Princess Bixiao walking out, and she immediately became the center of attention, surrounded by countless people.

Be it the humans or the Demon Race, all of them looked at Princess Bixiao with burning gazes.

Ling Han strode over, but the crowd was too packed, and he couldn’t squeeze in at all, unless he used violence. He smiled, and shouted, “Princess Bixiao, Princess Bixiao!”

Immediately, everyone turned to look at him with disdain. How could this person be so ignorant of the rules and shout at such an occasion?

The crowd parted, and Princess Bixiao walked out gracefully. Her beautiful eyes swirled, and she was extremely flirtatious. She was definitely the most beautiful person Ling Han had seen since entering the new world.

Princess Bixiao glanced at Ling Han, lightly parted her red lips, and said, “So

it’s Grandmaster Ling. Have you changed your mind?”

Ling Han smiled, waved his hand, and said, “Let’s not talk about this today. You have a subordinate who wants to challenge me to a battle, and everyone knows that if there is no wager, how could I accept the challenge? Therefore, I would like to ask Your Highness to be a witness, and safeguard the wager first, so as to prevent anyone from being shameless if they lose.”

“Are you done?” Bao Taigong roared. “I’m the son of the Leopard Clan’s Patriarch. How can I be shameless?”

“One should be wary of others. I’m not familiar with you,” Ling Han said calmly.

Princess Bixiao looked at Bao Taigong and asked, “Did you really make a bet with him?”

“Yes, Your Highness,” Bao Taigong said respectfully. It wasn’t that he knew that Princess Bixiao was a Mystery Realm Tier elite, but that Bixiao was too beautiful, and even among the youngsters of the Demon Race, she was adored.

Princess Bixiao thought for a moment and said, “Alright, hand the bet to me.”

Bixiao glared hatefully at Ling Han. This brat actually dared to drag Her Highness the Princess into this. However, he still took out a book, walked over, and handed it to Bixiao.

“Ling Han, where’s your bet?” Princess Bixiao asked Ling Han.

Bao Taigong was provoked by Ling Han to the point of losing his sense of propriety, but how could she possibly do the same?

That’s right, how could he have forgotten about this? He had been too focused on his anger. Bao Taigong scratched his head..

Ling Han nodded, took out an item from his robes, and tossed it towards Princess Bixiao.

This action made everyone dissatisfied. She was a peerless beauty. How could he be so disrespectful?

However, when they saw what Ling Han had thrown out, most of them had strange expressions on their faces, while some of the Demon Race members directly jumped up in anger.

Ling Han had actually only thrown out a jade seed.

Do you want to compare a jade seed with the cultivation technique of the Demon Race?

How humiliating was this?

“Ling Han, you’ve gone too far…”

“Do you think the cultivation technique of the Demon Race is only worth one jade seed?”

“You are humiliating us!”

Many people from the Demon Race roared furiously, wishing they could rip

Ling Han’s tendons and skin him alive.

Ling Han laughed coldly, and said, “What a joke. Now, it’s Bao Taigong who is challenging me, so of course we should go by my rules. Unconvinced? He could have chosen not to fight. I didn’t use a knife against his neck to force him.”

He paused and looked at Bao Taigong. “Are you still going to fight?”

Bao Taigong gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, let’s fight!”

He believed that he would not lose. Furthermore, Ling Han and Hong Tianbu were the only two “nemesis” of the Demon Race, so he had to defeat them at all costs, and restore the Demon Race’s reputation of being undefeated.

All the Demon Race members also nodded slowly. The significance of battling

Ling Han was not in the stakes, but in establishing the image of the Demon Race as invincible.

Under such circumstances, no matter how harsh Ling Han’s conditions were, they would still agree.

“Then let’s begin,” Princess Bixiao said. Her beautiful eyes were burning with the brilliance of wisdom.

Lmg Han and Bao Taigong moved to the courtyard. This place was very, very big. There was a rockery and a pond, and it was exquisite beyond compare. However, it was certain that once the battle started, this place would be reduced to ruins.

‘It doesn’t matter. It could just be rebuilt.’

“Ling Han, I’m at the third level of the Extreme Bone Tier, but when I fight you, I’ll suppress my power to the Blood Transformation Tier, and have a fair fight with you,” Bao Taigongsaid calmly. Since they were really about to fight, he had calmed down instead.

This was the reaction a prodigy should have.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “There’s no need to suppress your cultivation level. Since I’m willing to fight, I don’t need anyone to give me any handicaps!”

Hiss, he was so arrogant.

Bao Taigong sneered. “You said that yourself..”
