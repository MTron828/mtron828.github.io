Chapter 780: Arriving at Dome Cloud Island

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After taking care of the east region’s elites, he had them take back the cities that were seized.

The east region’s elites were all extremely gloomy; their running back and forth felt just like playing make believe, absolutely like a joke.

After recovering the lost territory, Ling Han had the east region’s elites return to properly handle the work of east region’s various large sects. After he took down the west region, he would then consider leading an army either north or east. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After a few more days, the sea race’s people came.

It was a Shattering Void Tier from Helian Family who brought Helian Rong’s personally written letter and delivered it to Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue to read.

....Helian Rong was the current generation’s leader of Helian royal family, and was also called King Helian. He was also Helian Xun Xue’s father.

The general idea in the letter was that the matter Helian Xunxue mentioned was too shocking; a few words in a letter weren’t enough to convince anyone, and there were many questions that needed Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue to see the north sea’s royal family and personally explain.

The letter also especially mentioned Ling Jian Xue, whom Helian Rong, his maternal grandfather, wanted to personally see.

“So?” Helian Xun Xue asked Ling Han.

Ling Han muttered to himself, and said, “We must go so that we can win over your family. However, we can’t exactly let our guard down, since it can be a trap.”

“Then what do you plan on doing?” Helian Xun Xue said. If possible, she obviously didn’t want to fall out with her family.

Ling Han pondered, and said, “Go ask Yi Shuang Shuang. If she’s willing to be our bodyguard, this trip will be safe. However, without her keeping watch over the imperial city, I’m worried that people will take advantage of her absence, which is rather problematic.”

Helian Xun Xue nodded. Now the five great ancient sects and the Thousand Corpse Sect all had their eyes on Great Ling Empire... although Purple Moon Emperor’s Court tied up the majority of their forces, but to send a few Shattering Void Tier elites was still possible. Who in the Imperial City would able to rival them?

Ling Han thought it over shortly, shook his head, and said, “Yi Shuang Shuang is not suited to leave. I’ll bring Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation, which can rival Shattering Void Tier seven stars; on top of Black Tower’s protection, even if there’s a falling out, there’s no need to be afraid.”

“So it’s really just the two of us going?” Helian Xun Xue was somewhat worried.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “My father-in-law wants to see his grandson, so we’ll show him.”

“If that’s the case, then I’ll have to make arrangements, or else if I’m not here, the matters of the empire would be hopelessly chaotic,” Helian Xun Xue said.

Ling Han couldn’t help but curl his lips, and said, “You say it like I haven’t done anything.”

Helian Xun Xue rolled her eyes, and said, “Then tell me, what have you done?”

Ling Han looked at her slender and alluring figure, and couldn’t help but tease her. “You!”

Helian Xun Xue was first taken aback, and then came to her senses, pinching Ling Han fiercely—this guy actually made a perverted joke, how truly rascally.

Yi Shuang Shuang couldn’t leave. The Imperial City was not only the center of the nation, but also Ling Family’s headquarters, so how could a mishap be allowed? If Yi Shuang Shuang didn’t keep watch, Ling Han would definitely put his parents in the Black Tower; after all, he was now a target for all.

After discussing for a while, Ling Han decided to bring Helian Xun Xue, Hu Niu, and his son to the north sea, not bringing the others.

Hu Niu hadn’t reached the Shattering Void Tier, but she had extremely fast speed, and even a Shattering Void Tier elite would have a hard time hurting her—she could go anywhere in the world. Besides, was it possible not to bring her...? The little girl was impossible to shake off.

They entered the desolate north again, and first went to see the situation with the ancient mineshaft in fire country. The black Qi was more and more terrifying, making Ling Han more worried as to when the buried dead people down there would come into the world.

After taking a glance, they went out to sea and set out towards Helian royal family’s ancestral grounds.

After martial artists advanced to the Flower Blossom Tier, they broke away from the mortal body, and it didn’t matter if they didn’t breathe or eat—as long as they could absorb Spirit Qi, they could maintain their life force. Reaching Ling Han’s height, their life force was even more formidable, and even without absorbing Spirit Qi, they could still hold out for several tens of years through exhausting their own Origin Power.

Thus, they held their breath and were like fish in the great sea.

Helian Xun Xue didn’t even need to hold her breath. She possessed true dragon’s blood, and it was no different for her whether she was in the water and on land; actually, her battle prowess even rose in the sea.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. In terms of Spirit Qi density, the sea wasn’t superior to the land, but the sea’s Spirit Qi was basically water element. The sea race was also basically water element, so, relatively, the sea race also had an extremely great cultivation advantage.

The sea was three-dimensional. Only small fish lived in the shallow areas, but after entering the deep sea, all sorts of large fish appeared one by one—super massive species also appeared especially after entering over five thousand meters deep.

These types of living creatures could easily reach several hundred of meters in size, becoming as large as a mountain—an extremely shocking thing. Even if these living creatures didn’t cultivate, their brute force was terrifyingly great, being able to crush a mountain with a light bump.

And hearing Helian Xun Xue’s words, this actually wasn’t the largest body type, not even one hundredth of it, which shocked Ling Han. Then once the super-sized sea monsters matured, would they be able to rival the Shattering Void Tier?

After three days, they were already far from the desolate north. According to Helian Xun Xue, it was about seven days’ journey to Helian royal family’s ancestral grounds.

Against expectations, Ling Han thought Helian family’s ancestral grounds were deep in the sea, but instead it was on a gigantic island. In reality, the majority of the sea race placed their ancestral grounds on islands because there were super-sized living beings at the bottom of the sea. They weren’t sentient and didn’t cultivate, but they were born with formidable physiques. If the ancestral grounds were set at the bottom of the sea, then they’d risk the danger of them being demolished by these living beings.

“Then why are you bringing me to the bottom of the sea?” Ling Han couldn’t help but ask.

Helian Xun Xue smiled, and said, “Since we’re at sea, I obviously want to properly show you the sea race’s sights.”

Ling Han was speechless.

After another seven days, they finally arrived at Helian royal family’s ancestral grounds, Dome Cloud Island.

“Stop! Who dares to barge in recklessly into Helian Family’s territory?” Just when they set foot on the island, they saw two guard-like “people” charge over; their upper body was human, but their lower body was lobster-shaped, astonishing Ling Han.

“S-seventh Princess!” When they saw Helian Xun Xue, they both knelt down half way in salutation.

Helian Xun Xue avoiding marriage undoubtedly made Helian and the Xianyu royal family pursue her together, but Helian royal family never said they abolished Helian Xun Xue’s position as a princess. Her bloodline was extremely rare and noble, and she definitely wouldn’t be demoted just like that.

If that was the case, how could these two lobster guards dare not to be respectful?

Helian Xun Xue waved her hand, and said, “I want to see my father.”

“Yes, this subordinate will immediately go report it!” A lobsterman turned and left. Actually, even if Helian Xun Xue didn’t say so, they would do so. Helian Xun Xue now carried the status of an “escapee,” and the Helian Family was constantly searching for her.

Ling Han stroked his chin. The saying “the ugly bride isn’t afraid to meet her parents-in-law” was true, and now that it was his turn to meet the father-in-law, he really felt somewhat nervous.
