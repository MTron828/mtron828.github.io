2675 He Yufeng appears

“Old geezer, never thought that Grandpa Dog would be so powerful, right?” The large black dog was proud of himself, swaying his behind, his iron underwear reflecting light. He couldn’t look any more despicable if he tried.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was indeed angered, and even Ling Han and the others felt their eyes hurt as they were blinded by this horrible sight.

“Strange!” the Imperial Void Celestial King mumbled. When one had reached a height like they had, it was possible that their strength could only increase by the slightest sliver in a whole epoch, but just how long had passed? The large black dog was actually able to stand as his equal now. This improvement was too shockingly large. It was completely unrealistic.

This was natural. The large black dog was strong not because his cultivation level had progressed, or because he had suddenly comprehended something, but rather because Ling Han had taught the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll to him. By now, the large black dog had already comprehended and fused four parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. This naturally boosted his battle prowess by a large extent, so he was now capable of matching the Imperial Void Celestial King.

Furthermore, the might of a complete Heavenly Venerate Technique was indeed greater, but it would also expend more power, and even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly channel it constantly. However, a Heavenly Venerate Technique that had been split was different. With the large black dog’s cultivation level, he was completely capable of channeling it continuously.

“Again!” The large black dog did not fall into a disadvantage in this exchange, so he was naturally unwilling to give up. With old feuds and new grudges all added together, how could he be willing to stop here?

The Imperial Void Celestial King humphed coldly. He naturally would not be afraid, either.

The two great Celestial Kings fought furiously, causing extensive damage and destruction.

Ling Han looked towards Yu Wudi, but did not speak. He looked like a hungry wolf that had set his eye on a little rabbit.

Yu Wudi felt a chill at the look in his eyes. Involuntarily, he took several steps back. He only came to his senses when he retreated to the point that he collided with a broken pillar. His face instantly flushed red.

“That’s enough, isn’t it? Today is the great day of our young master; please pay some respect to my master!” A voice rang out, and a powerful aura spread out. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Imperial Void Celestial King and the large black dog exchanged another three blows, and only then did they stop.

The person who had spoken to play mediator was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but he was only a monarch tier, and neither the Imperial Void Celestial King nor the large black dog took him to heart. However, he was speaking on behalf of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, so they still had to give his master some face.

“Old geezer, I’ll beat you up every time I see you,” the large black dog declared, pointing at the Imperial Void Celestial King.

The Imperial Void Celestial King almost exploded with fury. ‘You didn’t even f*cking get the upper hand, so why are you speaking so self-righteously?’ Usually, he would not be angered so easily, but the appearance of the large black dog was really too capable of drawing fury. His whole being was emanating a despicable feeling. Even if one did not want to get angry, it could not be done.

Du Shiyi sighed slowly, and said, “If anyone tells me again that Junior Brother and Brother Black Dog come from a super low-level dimension, I will definitely get angry at them.”

A’mu couldn’t help but laugh. True, what low-level dimension could produce Ling Han, Heavenborn, the Imperial Void Celestial King, the large black dog, Huo Furong, Ji Wuming… and other such supreme prodigies all of a sudden? All of them could possibly reach the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Was this super low-level dimension going to explode?

“Humph!”

The Imperial Void Celestial King beckoned his son to enter into the abode. Before he entered, he glared harshly at Ling Han and the large black dog, especially Ling Han. He had not been able to get rid of him at the Celestial Realm, and in the end, this little brat had gained enough time and room to mature. Now, he was close to standing on equal level with him.

Too bad, it was too late for regrets.

Ling Han, A’mu, and the others entered into the abode. Ling Han knew that He Yufeng definitely had not invited him here for anything good, but he couldn’t avoid him forever. Ultimately, he would have to face him eventually. It was useless to continue avoiding him.

Thus, he had come.

Banquets were more or less the same, an occasion for wining and dining and making some friends.

Representatives had also come from the Wang Clan, and it was not just the little princess of the Wang Clan. There were also two important characters, Wang Qianyang and Wang Yangming, which could be considered as having given He Yufeng enough face.

By now, Wang Yangming’s attitude towards Ling Han was even more passionate than Wang Qianyang’s. The moment he saw Ling Han, he walked over, dragging Wang Jiayue with him, and said, “Young friend Ling, long time no see!”

How long could it be?

Ling Han chuckled, and replied, “Greetings, Seniors.” As for Wang Jiayue? He naturally ignored her entirely.

Wang Jiayue humphed. This man actually dared to reject her, so she was both angered and dissatisfied.

A’mu and the other big shots had their own circles, so it was naturally impossible that they would constantly stay with Ling Han. Seeing the people from the Wang Clan approach, they smiled, excused themselves, and walked elsewhere.

Ling Han chatted idly with Wang Qianyang and Wang Yangming, and it was inevitable that He Yufeng would come up in conversation.

“This boy is truly freakish. It has only been 300 billion years, and he has already advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. This kind of accomplishment can be ranked in the top three in the last epoch.” Wang Qianyang was very rueful. “I have lived for three epochs, yet still have not glimpsed the Heavenly Venerable Tier. In comparison, this is truly something to make one feel rueful.”

Though the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier were only separated by a single line, if one could not sense that unique power of heaven and earth, then no matter how outstanding your talent was, you would still be stuck at the Celestial King Tier even after a hundred epochs had passed.

Wang Yangming was unconvinced, and said, “Ande is not that far off, either. He has set foot in the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier using only 401 billion years!”

Wang Qianyang also showed a sliver of pride. The reason why He Yufeng had managed to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier sooner was also because his old man was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and had gotten enough natural treasures for him. Otherwise, the time of his breakthrough to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier would not be any less than that of the supreme prodigy of their own clan.

Ling Han merely smiled in response. He could not bring himself to say that, in actual fact, he was already able to sense Void Particle Energy, and could extract it to temper himself. From a certain point of view, he was already a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, but one that was weakened countless times over. He could just barely possess battle prowess at the level of the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven.

He would not boast about that; it was probable there was no one that would believe him anyways.

A Seventh Heaven Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate? Hehe.

More and more people arrived. Ling Han kept looking for the owner of that carriage pulled by the golden ox formed of Divine Metal, but no matter whom he asked, they would all shake their heads. They did not know that such an incredibly awesome character had also arrived at the banquet.

This person was keeping such a low profile.

When the moon had reached the center of the sky, someone suddenly shouted loudly, “The young master arrives!”

Instantly, there was a complete silence as everyone turned to look at the entrance of the inner courtyard.

The figure of a young man very soon appeared. He was of slender, tall build, with a handsome face. His aura was subtle, and he seemed like an ordinary man, but one only had to take a better look, and one would discover how different he was. But to exactly point out what the difference was, it was not something that could be expressed in words.

He Yufeng, a newly broken through Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“Cocky!” The large black dog scoffed.

Ling Han also nodded, but also felt a bit of surprise because it had only been half a year since He Yufeng broke through, yet he had already taken control of his aura. Clearly, he had stabilized his cultivation level. This aspect proved just how freakish he was.

He Yufeng was dashing and elegant, raising his cup to propose a toast. His words were also very polite, not putting on the airs of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate at all, so everyone gradually let go of their reservations and wariness, and liveliness returned once more to the area.

“Which of you are Ling Han?” He Yufeng suddenly asked.

Instantly, dead silence fell once more, and everyone turned to look at Ling Han.

Ling Han only acted as if he had not heard anything, and slowly sipped from his cup of wine.

He Yufeng looked towards him, and said, “It was you who killed that servant of mine?”

When these words fell, a wave of commotion arose among the crowd.

When had this happened? Ling Han was too brave, wasn’t he? He dared to make a move even on one of He Yufeng’s men?

“That’s right. Based on the results, it was indeed I who killed him.” Ling Han nodded very frankly.
