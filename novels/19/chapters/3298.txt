Chapter 3299 - 3299: Two Middle Level Formation Masters

Zhong Feiyang smiled faintly and said, “Then I won’t hold back.”

His hands moved repeatedly, and threw out formation foundations one after another. There were a lot of them, actually over thirty of them, but his speed was not the slightest bit slow. In just about half a minute, the formation foundations were all set up.

Subsequently, the formation patterns lit up, indicating that the formation was already working.

“Yi, what formation requires thirty-six formation foundations?” “Could it be that it is also a formation within a formation?”

“That’s not right!”

A Middle Level Formation Master suddenly stood up, hissed, and said, “This is the Wild Lightning Formation!”

“What!” Those who heard his words were all shocked, because the Wild Lightning Formation wasn’t an Elementary Level Formation at all, but a Middle Level Formation!

What did this signify?

Zhong Feiyang was a Middle Level Formation Master.

But in the register of the Formation Master Association, wasn’t he still Elementary Level?

“It’s very simple. Though he can create a Middle Level Formations, he didn’t go to obtain certification, so he’s naturally still an Elementary Level Formation Master,” someone said.

This was indeed a very simple logic, but who would be able to become a Middle Level Formation Master and would still be able to resist the temptation of being certified and raise their status?

It was just like how a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator and a Meridian Opening Tier cultivator were completely different.

How old was Zhong Feiyang?

Twenty-five years old, and at twenty-five years old, he had already advanced into Middle Level. Aside from Hong Tianbu, who else could compare?

Even Chen Hao nodded in agreement. Such a young Middle Level Formation Master was truly hard to come by. It could be said that one would only appear once every 100 years—forget about Hong Tianbu; that person shouldn’t even exist in this world.

“I really never thought that there would be a Middle Level Formation Master below thirty years old.”

“Even if Ling Han lost, it would not have been for no reason. He encountered a formations prodigy.”

Everyone was feeling rueful. A Middle Level would definitely have a crushing advantage over an Elementary Level.

“Do you still want to break the formation?” Zhong Feiyang asked calmly. The

Wild Lightning Formation possessed a terrifying destructive power, and even Blood Transformation Tier elites could be killed if they were trapped within. The difficulty of breaking this formation could naturally be imagined.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Alright, I’ll give it a try.”

Everyone couldn’t help but be speechless. Was this something that could be tried? Once you entered the formation, as long as the formation didn’t stop, the violent lightning would strike endlessly, and it would be extremely difficult to escape.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Though the individual abilities of Formation Masters were inferior to cultivators, once formations were set up, the result would be different.

Ling Han strode forwards, and took the initiative to enter into the formations.

Instantly, lightning flashed, and danced between the formation foundations. Then, a bolt of lightning quietly formed, striking fiercely towards him.

However, Ling Han was already prepared. He raised his right hand in front of him to protect himself. Crackle… A bolt of lightning struck over. Although it created a blinding arc of lightning, it couldn’t wound him at all.

This could hurt a Third Change Blood Transformation Tier, but Ling Han’s strength had long since surpassed Third Change.

Zi, zi, zi! Lightning was still shooting out from all corners. Ling Han casually brandished his fists, blasting the lightning into sparks.

He grasped the pulsation of the formations. This could reconstruct the positions of the nodes.

At present, there were not many Middle Level formations, only seventeen types. Ling Han had dabbled in all of them, so he naturally knew about the Wild Lightning Formation.

However, the formations that everyone set up would be modified. When a thousand people set up a formation, there would be a thousand different positions for the nodes. Thus, this could only be deduced through the channelling of the formations.

In less than three minutes, Ling Han threw out the Destructive Formation.

He didn’t expect to have a Middle Level Formation Master as his opponent, so he didn’t prepare the Middle Level Destructive Formation and still used the Elementary Level formation. However, as long as he found the right nodes, he could completely cut off the power to this formation for a few seconds. This was enough, which meant that he had already found the nodes.

Shua, three formation foundations fell, and were activated by Ling Han. Instantly, the wild lightning stopped, but after only a while, lightning flashed again. Pa, pa, pa, the three Destructive Formation foundations were completely charred.

There was complete silence.

What? Ling Han had actually deciphered the Wild Lightning Formation?

An Elementary Level Formation Master was actually capable of unravelling a Middle Level Formation?

Indeed, breaking formations was easier than creating formations, but it couldn’t possibly be so easy as to overcome the gap of a whole level.

Unless…!

This thought flashed through everyone’s minds, but they immediately shook their heads. That was impossible.

“You’re also a Middle Level Formation Master!” Zhong Feiyang exclaimed in shock.

If that wasn’t the case, how could Ling Han have possibly broken through his formation? Furthermore, it was only three minutes, and even the majority of Middle Level Formation Masters wouldn’t have been able to do so.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Probably. I haven’t deliberately studied this problem.”

This show-off.

Everyone wanted to complain. Was there anyone who didn’t know their own strength? How low was the possibility of someone who was completely focused on formations, and then suddenly wanted to go out one day, only to discover that they were already invincible in the world?

Zhong Feiyang took a deep breath, and said, “Alright, it’s your turn to attack.”

Ling Han nodded, and went to the sidelines to retrieve his formation foundations. There were quite a number of them, so it was naturally inconvenient to bring them with him when he was breaking the formation.

However, he had to change his strategy.

Zhong Feiyang was actually a Middle Level Formation Master. If he used an Elementary Level formation against Zhong Feiyang, the latter would probably be able to crack it in a few moves.

He reached into the bag. Actually, he was using his consciousness to communicate with the Essence Nurturing Gourd and took out a great many formation foundations.

Middle Level formations, Raging Flames Formation.

With pure strength, he was already unafraid of any Blood Transformation Tier elite, so he naturally wouldn’t be interested in offensive Middle Level formations. However, he still created it in case of emergencies. He didn’t expect it to come in handy so quickly.

Ling Han took the formation foundations and returned to the battlefield. Then, he waved his hands repeatedly, and instantly, like a celestial maiden scattering flowers, thirty-six formation foundations were stabbed into the ground at the same time, and stimulated by his Spiritual Power, the formation was established.

“Please,” he said to Zhong Feiyang.

Zhong Feiyang naturally wouldn’t cower. He strode into the formation, and instantly, raging flames burned, turning the area enshrouded by the formation into a sea of flames.

With a casual wave of his hand, five formation foundations immediately appeared around him, protecting him.

This could only last for a while, but Zhong Feiyang believed that this little bit of time was enough.

He immediately began to decipher the formation, searching for the nodes of the formation.

Time slowly crept by. Zhong Feiyang tried again and again, yet he failed time and time again.

He was indeed a formations prodigy. He had only attempted eleven times, and he had already deciphered this Raging Flames Formation. However, he had also used as much as thirteen minutes, so he naturally lost to Ling Han.

Ling Han emerged victorious without any argument.

Chen Hao was overjoyed. Two prodigies in a row had appeared in the field of formations, so he, as the Chairperson, was naturally pleased. He had someone to succeed him now.

Humph, after a while, he brought Ling Han and Zhong Feiyang to find Old Man Qi from the Alchemist Association. He wanted to show this old man that even without Hong Tianbu, the field of formations would still have endless prodigies.

Ling Han originally wanted to immediately return to the academy, but the Formation Masters Association still had to award him and Zhong Feiyang the certification of a Middle Level Formation Master, so he stayed here for another day.

At night, he flipped through the prize he had obtained.

This incomplete formation was called “Precipice”, and the formation foundations were very unique. It didn’t use rocks or metal as materials, but formation patterns were directly inscribed on clothes. After wearing it, the formation foundations would automatically activate when attacked, forming a powerful defense..
