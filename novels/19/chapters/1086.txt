Chapter 1087: Broken Yang Shuang

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Senior Brother Tang!” The students of the Eastern Institution were all overjoyed upon seeing him appear. They had still been anxious a moment ago, yet they all recovered their confidence now. It was as if his appearance had caused them to suddenly grow a backbone.

This youth was none other than Tang Jiu, and his battle prowess was ranked ninth out of all the students in the Eastern Institution!

He had a cultivation level at the peak stage of the consummate level, and he could even surpass three stars. He was a once-in-ten-thousand-years super genius.

On a side note, he was called Tang Jiu because his battle prowess was ranked ninth right now. He had been called Tang Shi several decades ago, and there was a possibility that he would be called Tang Ba or Tang Qi and so on in the future 1 .

“Release him!” Tang Jiu said coldly. His eyes were as bright as two fireballs, and his exposed arms were covered with crimson divine patterns. These divine patterns extended all the way from the back of his hands to his shoulders, and looked as if they had been drawn with some sort of red metal.

He was confident, and he was domineering. These were qualities that elites needed to possess.

Ling Han trampled Yang Shuang under his feet. He was treating Yang Shuang exactly as Yang Shuang had treated Jin Zhihui—he would definitely not let him off lightly. He looked at Tang Jiu, and said, “Why should I?”

“Because I, Tang Jiu, said so!” Tang Jiu said in a sinister voice. He was already seething with fury because Ling Han had actually dared to speak back to him.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Tang Jiu? I’ve never heard of such a person!”

“You’re seeking death!” Tang Jiu didn’t speak any more nonsense, and immediately charged toward Ling Han.

Shua!

A chilly light flashed toward Ling Han’s throat.

A curved bow had appeared in Tang Jiu’s hands at some point in time, and it had fired a devastating burst of light toward Ling Han.

Ling Han threw a kick, launching Yang Shuang into the air.

Pu!

The chilly light instantly cut into Yang Shuang’s rear, causing blood to spurt through the air. Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Tsk, tsk, tsk, is there some forbidden love between you two? Why are you aiming for his an*s?”

Yang Shuang looked at Tang Jiu with an aggrieved expression. ‘Can’t you aim a bit better? Why are you attacking me?’

Tang Jiu flared up in rage. He jabbed his finger toward Ling Han, and shouted, “Release him if you have any balls! Then we can fight without restraint!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This isn’t a hostage. Rather, it’s my new treasured sword. It can be called a human sword, and it can also be called a b*tch human 1 !”

He was holding onto Yang Shuang’s neck, and under the influence of his Origin Power, Yang Shuang’s body could only remain straight and rigid. As such, he was forcefully used as a sword by Ling Han.

Yang Shuang wanted to die. Didn’t he just snatch Ling Han’s sword? Was there a need to humiliate him so much?

“Ling Han, your actions make me despise you!” Tang Jiu tried to provoke Ling Han.

“Who are you? Do I need to take your thoughts seriously?” Ling Han scoffed.

Tang Jiu boiled with anger. Great, he had failed to provoke Ling Han, and had instead ended up being infuriated himself. “You came to cause trouble in our Eastern Institution, so we definitely can’t let you return in one piece!” he threatened viciously. “Junior Brother Yang, endure your misfortune. The academy’s face is more important than you!”

Tang Jiu attacked with his full strength, not holding back any longer.

Ling Han raised his “sword” to parry. With his current power, wielding a person was naturally nothing too difficult. Meanwhile, Yang Shuang had descended into an even more wretched situation. Not only did he have to endure Ling Han’s sword intent, but he even had to face Tang Jiu’s relentless attacks head on. Only a few blows had been exchanged, yet dozens of his bones had already been broken.

If this continued, it was entirely possible that he would be killed.

Ling Han casually tossed Yang Shuang aside. It would genuinely be excessive if he continued to use him like a sword. Right now, he had only left Yang Shuang with severe injuries. In addition, he was the one in the right. If he killed him, however, the commotion and trouble that followed would be extremely difficult to deal with.

There was no need to go so far.

“Watch how I smash you into pulp!” Tang Jiu let out a roar, not caring about anything else. His attacks became even more ferocious and wild.

“Hehe!” Ling Han chuckled as he unleashed the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique. Tang Jiu’s attacks instantly faltered, and he could only muster his defenses hastily as he watched Ling Han’s fist smash over.

There were relatively few secret techniques that cultivated the divine sense, and this was also the reason for the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique being so valuable. Although Tang Jiu possessed a higher cultivation level, his divine sense wasn’t necessarily more powerful than Ling Han’s. As a result, his battle prowess instantly fell by a great amount after being struck by Ling Han’s divine sense attack.

The two of them continued to battle, and Ling Han continuously used his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique to suppress the battle prowess of his opponent, dragging him down to a similar level as himself.

Tang Jiu was crazy with rage. His battle prowess was clearly powerful enough to crush Ling Han, yet he was always forced to falter due to the indefensible spiritual attacks from his opponent. This caused his attacks to lose fluidity, resulting in him only being able to unleash 10-20% of his full power.

He had never felt so constrained in a battle before. He was so vexed that he almost wanted to vomit blood.

Meanwhile, the spectating students were all stunned. ‘Is Ling Han trying to defy the heavens?

‘How many stars has his battle prowess surpassed?’

“It isn’t Ling Han’s battle prowess that’s incredible. Rather, this situation is because Senior Brother Tang’s battle prowess has been weakened!”

“But even if it’s been weakened, that’s still due to the ability of Ling Han. This can also be counted as part of Ling Han’s battle prowess, right?”

The spectating students all exchanged glances. After all, secret techniques pertaining spiritual attacks were far too rare. In fact, they were so rare that barely anyone still cultivated their divine sense to defend against such attacks. That being the case, did this count as Ling Han elevating his tier surpassing battle prowess?

Was his battle prowess at the late stage of the consummate level, or was it three stars above the peak stage?

The two exchanged a few more blows before Tang Jiu angrily leaped to the side.

‘F*ck it!’

He would go mad if they continued to fight. There was no way for him to unleash his full battle prowess, and this made him feel extremely constrained and uncomfortable.

“Done fighting?” Ling Han asked with a smile. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tang Jiu didn’t reply, and merely glowered at Ling Han. After a moment, he flicked his sleeves and left. He was genuinely unable to stop Ling Han. Moreover, his opponent had only just advanced to the high extreme, while he had already been at the consummate level for many years. He was completely picking on the weak.

He had failed to win, so what was the point of fighting any longer?

Tang Jiu had left, and the spectating students were all at a loss for words.

There were only eight elites more powerful than Tang Jiu, yet none of them were present—they were either training outside or cultivating in seclusion. How could they be casually called over?

Them being able to call Tang Jiu over was already a pleasant surprise. However, even Tang Jiu had been unable to defeat Ling Han. As such, there was nothing more the Eastern Institution could do.

Ling Han smiled at Jin Zhihui, and said, “Brother Jin, let’s go!”

Jin Zhihui nodded, and replied, “Mm-hm!”

The two of them entered the main gates of the Eastern Institution just like that. They swaggered through the Eastern Institution as they walked toward the Northern Institution.

The students of the Eastern Institution followed behind them, all of them seething with anger and clenching their fists.

‘You two are really treating the Eastern Institution as a shortcut!’

Jin Zhihui was baffled, and he asked, “Brother Ling, why do these people keep following us? Why was I targeted when I said that I wanted to visit you?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Brother Jin, you might not know, but this Scarlet Heaven Academy is actually divided into four major institutions...”

He told Jin Zhihui the reason for him being targeted, and this left the latter feeling extremely vexed. So it turned out that he had brought trouble onto himself.

“Brother Jin, is this the sword that you forged?” Ling Han patted his shoulder and pointed toward the sword in his hand.

Jin Zhihui’s face instantly lit up, and he nodded profusely, saying, “That’s right, this is the sword that I forged! The material of this sword is a piece of extraterrestrial meteoric metal, and the Swordforge Manor conducted a lot of tests after obtaining this metal. However, everyone concluded that this was only a Level One Godly metal.

“However, after investigating it for thousands of years, I reached the conclusion that this is definitely no ordinary Level One Godly metal...

“Indeed, it’s only a Level One Godly metal in its current state. However, it’s as if this piece of metal possesses life, and it even has the ability to grow!

“I investigated it for another tens of thousands of years, and all I was thinking about was how to maintain its growth ability after forging it into a sword. Moreover, I had to maintain the sword’s shape and power!

“And now, I’ve finally succeeded!”
