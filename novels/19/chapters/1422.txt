Chapter 1423 The Empress“ Fury

“you have touched my reverse scale!” empress luan xing said darkly, and with a sudden wave of her hand, hong, a power that could not be resisted surged towards them. pa, pa, pa. in an instant, over a dozen heavenly body tier elites had been blasted into a mist of blood.

pu! pu!

the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor threw up blood madly at the same time. they exchanged a look. both of them were shocked.

‘haven’t you yet not passed the heavenly tribulation? why would your abilities be so powerful?’

they had all experienced the same, and naturally knew that one’s abilities would become stronger with every tribulation passed. correspondingly, the might of the heavenly tribulation would also increase and maintain a powerful pressure all the same.

precisely because of this, when 10 people underwent a heavenly tribulation, it was possible that seven of them might not make it through, and die in the end.

yet empress luan xing had turned over this perception. she was indescribably powerful.

with their cultivation level, added with the power of the nation, they couldn’t even hold up against a single attack from empress luan xing!

‘how is this possible?!’

she no longer had power of the nation to draw on! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

the two emperors felts incredibly pained. in the end, they were still too late.

they looked at ling han. if it had not been because of this man, the end result would definitely have been different.

they would have long since been able to barge in, and in that case, empress luan xing couldn’t possibly have broken through. furthermore, because she’d have been disturbed during her isolation, this would’ve created a powerful reverse bite for her. empress luan xing would’ve definitely been severely wounded, and thus could’ve been easily subdued.

previously, ding li’an had dared to break through the restrictions and attempted to enter because he knew that fact. otherwise, how could he dare have designs about the empress when he was only in the high extreme?

looking at empress luan xing’s position, she not only wanted to kill them. furthermore, she “couldn’t bear” to kill them immediately, and planned to kill them in a drawn-out, tortuous way. they were both people who had been in lofty positions for a long time, and knew that people like them could not possibly change their mind once they had made a decision. thus, neither of them had any intention to beg for mercy at all. instead, they turned their attention on ling han.

even if they were to die, they would bring ling han along with them.

‘if i can’t obtain you, this brat would not, either!’

“die!”

the two emperors exploded simultaneously. they had completely revived their ancestral weapon, releasing the greatest might of heavenly body tier. using themselves to control the weapon, they attacked ling han.

this was their most brilliant strike.

too bad, though the present empress luan xing was still in the heavenly body tier, her battle prowess had soared into the eternal river tier.

it was an absolute one-sided suppression when an eternal river tier faced against a heavenly body tier!

peng, the empress merely raised her hand casually, and the two emperors were frozen stiff, unable to move even a single muscle. they tried their best to struggle, but it was completely useless. they could not free themselves at all.

“to dare harm my beloved, the two of you are courting death!” empress luan xing’s whole head of black locks fluttered, her robes dancing. even in her utmost fury, she was still amazingly beautiful, and did not make anyone feel terrified in the slightest.

“i am very angered, extremely angered!”

when she said these words, everyone’s surprise grew further.

previously, though everyone had known, empress luan xing had after all still been quite reserved, yet she now directly called ling han her beloved. the empress was really a temperamental person, having absolutely no intention to hide the truth.

f***, they were again forced to watch a public display of affection.

pa!

empress luan xing raised her hand and a palm strike descended. she delivered a slap into empty air, and both the faces of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor suffered a slap at the same time. the sound was crisp and prompt. so what if they were two great emperors? one side of their faces immediately became swollen, and they stumbled as if they had become drunk.

“i want to tear the two of you into pieces, and feed you to the wild dogs!”

the empress was practically extraordinarily furious. her flames of anger did not diminish, but instead burned ever brighter. at first, she was only worried about ling han’s injuries, but as this anxiety vanished, she thought of even more.

what if she had come out too late, and ling han had guarded her with his life, and had died in the end?

the moment she thought of that scene, the empress’s eyes reddened, her delicate hands balled into tight fists. every single hair on her head was filled with killing intent, and every gaze was filled with thunderous fury.

if ling han had died, she would’ve killed all the living creatures on joint peace planet to be buried alongside ling han!

“who do you think you are!”

pa! pa! pa!

empress luan xing continued to slap them madly. she did not hold any power in reserve at all. after each strike, the two great emperors were completely bruised and battered. after a few times, they could no longer hold on. one after another, broken teeth had been slapped out of their mouths, together with blood. their hair was dishevelled. what austerity of an emperor did they have left?

the present them were not much different from wild dogs.

yet empress luan xing did not look like she would stop at all. the divine lightning rumbled, hiding their terrible cries, but the slapping sound was incredibly clear. pa, pa, pa, it continued to be heard.

empress luan xing became more and more furious. she wanted very much to kill these two people, but how could directly killing them vent her anger? thus, she controlled her strength. however, her eyes focused on the other heavenly body tiers from the two majestic empires. with a tap of her finger, pa, one heavenly body tier elite would be blasted into a mist of blood, both his form and spirit destroyed.

this was the majestic bearing of the strongest king tier, invincible among her peers.

“long live your majesty!” qu qiuxue and the others cheered loudly, so excited that they felt numb.

this was their ruler, who could kill one person with a single step, and who had no equal!

the two great emperors exchanged a look, and couldn’t help but reveal a sliver of grief in their expressions.

the gap between them and empress luan xing had already expanded to an unimaginable extent, and they could not even die a quick death.

a ruler could not be humiliated!

the two emperors roared in fury, and rose vigorously in a counterattack.

naturally, they were not planning to put their lives on the line in a gamble, but rather wanted to make use of the opening of attacking the empress to draw the heavenly tribulation towards themselves. going by the regulations of the heaven and earth, one who took the initiative to attack someone undergoing the heavenly tribulation would implicate himself in it as well.

going through the heavenly tribulation meant that they had control of their own life and death—just let them die, all right?

hong, long, long, the tribulation cloud began to increasingly adjust its might according to the cultivation levels of the two emperors.

the beautiful eyes of empress luan xing narrowed. the two of you were planning to commit suicide?

kuong, the divine lightning descended, and this time, it was targeting the two emperors.

the two great emperors looked like they had been absolved. this time, they could finally die.

king tiers had their own pride. even if they were to die, they would die standing, and die an honorable death.

pa!

a large hand appeared in thin air, forming a shield above the two great emperors. it was astonishingly beautiful like a mountain of jade.

the divine lightning descended, yet was born up by this large hand, and did not strike the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor at all.

this... empress luan xing had actually moved!

who could’ve imagined this?

why had empress luan xing moved to protect them? previously, wasn’t it she who had forced the two great emperors into dead-end?

but in the next instant, realization dawned on them.

the empress did this because she did not want them to die too easily. instead, she wanted to kill them slowly, one slap at a time.

women definitely could not be offended. this was really too cruel!

however, a heavenly tribulation definitely could not be passed on another’s behalf.

kuong, the next time the heavenly tribulation descended, its might had increased a whole tenfold.

this was the heaven and earth showing their might, and was also a warning. no one could go against the regulations of heaven and earth. the offender would definitely be punished.

the might of the heavenly tribulation directly increased tenfold, and with empress luan xing’s battle prowess, it was not something that she could not stand against. however, this was only a beginning as it would be followed by a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times... it’d be endlessly increasing right until the person who had interfered would be killed.

thus, even a proud person the likes of empress luan xing dared not make another attempt to interfere.
