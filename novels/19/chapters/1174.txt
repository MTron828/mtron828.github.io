Chapter 1175: Cooperation

Ling Han swept his gaze over the encircling group, and said, “You people don’t have the right to know my name!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Boss, there’s no need to speak nonsense with him. Kill him!” one of the evil villains shouted. He seemed extremely haughty.

The villain boss hesitated for a moment before retrieving a vial of pills. However, he didn’t open the vial, instead saying, “Sir, it’s not too late for you to leave now. However, you have to leave these two women!” He pointed at Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun.

Upon seeing the killing intent on Ling Han’s face, he immediately raised the vial in his hand, and said, “Do you know what these are? These are Purple Pattern Mountain River Pills, and they can raise my battle prowess by three stars!

“My cultivation level is already at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. After raising my battle prowess by another three stars, do you really think you’ll be any match for me?”

He had spent a fortune on this vial of pills, which only contained two pills in total. Thus, he didn’t want to use them if he didn’t have to. This was his trump card, and it was much more effective as a threat than if he genuinely ingested them.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. He truly couldn’t hold his laughter back.

He shook his head, and said, “Say, how ignorant do you have to be to think that raising your battle prowess by three stars will make you invincible in the Mountain River Tier?”

“You dare to belittle me?” the villain boss roared in anger.

Ling Han raised a hand.

Weng!

A formidable aura crushed down, and the villain boss’s face instantly became as white as a sheet. He didn’t dare to move even a pinky.

The pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier—how incredibly mighty was this? It was only natural that Ling Han could easily crush someone at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. Moreover, the villain boss was only an ordinary Mountain River Tier cultivator, and he couldn’t even be considered a one-star genius. The gulf in power between them was like night and day.

Ling Han casually extended his hand and grabbed the vial of pills. He then smiled, and said, “It’ll be a huge waste if you were to ingest these pills. It’s better if I sell them for some money. I can probably buy a tael1 of Level Four Godly metal for it.”

The villains were all transfixed with shock. Their boss had actually been defeated with a single move?!

Although the big-bellied man had been sliced into two, they could’ve said that he’d been careless, or that his opponent’s sword was far too powerful. However, what excuse did they have now?

They trembled uncontrollably as terror gripped at their hearts.

“S-spare me!” The villain boss instantly discarded his dignity and started to beg for his life.

He was a realist.

An eerie killing intent appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “Didn’t you want me to leave the women?”

The villain boss shook his head frantically, and stuttered, “N-no, I wouldn’t dare to!”

“Heh, that’s because I’m powerful enough. If I had been weaker than you, my women would have become your playthings!” Ling Han said calmly.

Hu Feiyun raised her hand in protest, and said, “Ling Han, I’m not your woman!”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Can’t you see that I’m showing off my brilliant might right now? Did you really have to interrupt me and ruin the atmosphere?”

“Oh...” Hu Feiyun nodded weakly as she lowered her head and started to twiddle her fingers.

“I’m not a bloodthirsty person, but it’s a shame that I can’t see any redeeming features in you people. There’s no reason for me to be sympathetic.” Ling Han raised his right hand, and the Divine Demon Sword moved along with his actions. The tip of the Divine Demon Sword hovered over the villains’ bodies.

“We’ve no option but to fight him!” The villains weren’t stupid, and they all prepared to battle upon realizing that Ling Han had no intention of letting them off. They would battle to the death.

If there were even a sliver of hope, these people would even stoop as low as to pretend to be a subservient lackey. However, if all avenues to life were severed, they would become ferocious madmen who fought to their very last breath. They definitely wouldn’t lie down and accept death.

They turned their attention away from the red-haired beauty and her group and all charged toward Ling Han. Either Ling Han died, or they died.

Ling Han smiled coldly as he unclasped a hand.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

24 streaks of divine light shot out.

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

The heads of the 24 villains instantly exploded. Their deaths were swift and violent.

The red-haired beauty and the other six members of her group were all stunned, looks of sheer disbelief on their faces as they stared at Ling Han. What kind of freakish battle prowess was this?

Weren’t Sun Moon Tier elites not allowed to enter this Mystery Realm? However, was Ling Han’s battle prowess not at the Sun Moon Tier?

Those 24 villains were at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier! Yet, they had been insta-killed just like that? Who could believe this?

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “No need to thank me.”

He grabbed Shui Yanyu’s hand and started to walk off.

Hu Feiyun faltered for a moment before hurriedly running after them, and shouting, “Wait for me!”

“Oi, oi, oi!” The red-haired beauty also came to her senses, and she immediately sprinted after Ling Han and the others. “Handsome guy, why are you leaving so quickly? Are you scared that I’ll bite?” She winked at Ling Han as she said this.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. This woman seemed fairly laid-back for someone who had almost been killed just then. In fact, she was even in high enough spirits to wink at him.

“Are you okay?” Shui Yanyu asked.

“Sigh!” The red-haired beauty sighed before saying, “Our losses were truly great this time.”

She immediately started to recount the events, not caring whether Ling Han and the others were interested.

As it turned out, they were a mercenary group that accepted money to complete missions.

However, they weren’t hired for a job this time, and had instead paid a fortune to enter this mystery realm. Their target was a treasure storage that existed inside this mystery realm—they had discovered this treasure storage on a mission to enter with and protect someone. However, many members of their mercenary group had died, and even the person who had hired them lost their life.

Even so, they still yearned to enter that treasure storage. Thus, they spent a fortune to enter this mystery realm again.

However, they discovered a Nine Layer Divine Lotus on their way, and they only managed to obtain it after sacrificing four members of their group while fighting the Demonic Beast that guarded it. They were extremely unfortunate, though, and the group of villains had noticed and targeted them.

If it weren’t for the fact that the villains were afraid of them going all out and even destroying the Nine Layer Divine Lotus, the red-haired beauty and her group definitely wouldn’t have survived until Ling Han and the others came.

“Handsome guy, you’re so powerful! Why don’t we team up and cooperate?” The red-haired beauty invited them to work together. “Oh, that’s right, my name is Wei, Meng Wei.”

‘Are we really teaming up to find treasures?’ Ling Han grumbled in his mind. ‘It looks like you want to gobble me up!’

“How does 50-50 sound?” Meng Wei was extremely enthusiastic, and she continued, “Although you’re strong, we’re the ones who are providing the location of the treasure storage. So, splitting the treasures 50-50 isn’t too greedy on our part, right?”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “I still haven’t accepted your invitation yet!”

Meng Wei laughed loudly, and said, “It’s okay, I’m sure you’ll accept my invitation after considering it for a while.”

She didn’t seem to mind that her breasts were undulating as she laughed. It was almost as if her breasts were about to jump out from her armor.

Ling Han’s expression became serious, and he asked, “What treasure storage is this? Do you mind telling me?”

Meng Wei’s expression was as if she expected this answer. “That place was probably the abode of an alchemist, so there are heaps of alchemical pills. Perhaps there are even some pill recipes. If we make copies of the pill recipes, we’ll definitely make huge fortunes selling them.”

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He was absorbed by the word “alchemist”.

He nodded, and said, “Fine, let’s work together. We’ll split the alchemical pills evenly, and we’ll each make a copy of any pill recipe we find.”

“Deal!” Meng Wei extended her hand.

Ling Han slapped her hand lightly, and the two of them sealed their deal.

They set off toward the abode of the alchemist. However, they decided to rest when night fell, so that they could recover their energy. The red-haired beauty and her group had just experienced an intense battle, after all
