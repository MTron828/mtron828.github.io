2878 Rematch

Upon hearing Ling Han’s words, the cultivators on the opposing side hurriedly shook their heads.

Even Mi Wenbai couldn’t withstand a single strike from Ling Han, so anyone who dared to step forward would naturally be instantly defeated by him as well. If they allowed Ling Han to stay on for three more battles, that would simply be a matter of him throwing three more punches. At that time, another three veins of ores would be taken away by him.

“Ling Han? Ling Han! I remember now!” Finally, the person who had felt a sense of familiarity with Ling Han’s name clapped his hands, exclaiming.

This was someone who had created history before! This was someone with peerless courage!

!!

Ling Han involuntarily sighed. Why couldn’t the victor stay behind for more battles? What kind of crappy rule was this?

He walked back to his spot. Meanwhile, those on his side still had yet to come to their senses. Their minds were still numb with shock.

Afterward, Ling Jianxue stepped forward to battle. Taking advantage of Ling Han’s remnant might that was still to disappear, with their opponents still reeling in shock, he also won his battle

However, their opponent finally came to their senses for the remaining two battles. Thus, they were able to nab the final two victories.

As a result, their opponents won eight of the 10 veins of ore, while Ling Han and the others could only take two.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. Throughout his cultivation journey, he had never been on the receiving end of an unfair deal. He had always enjoyed the upper hand. Now, however, they had actually lost, winning only two of the 10 veins of ore. This was utter humiliation!

However, there was nothing he could do about this. Who told his son to be so stubborn and inflexible?

Anyhow, how would they decide which vein of ore belonged to whom?

At this moment, Ling Han displayed his domineering side, not caring for others’ opinions as he directly chose two veins of ores. He didn’t allow anyone to oppose him.

His words were: “If anyone has any objections, tell me after you defeat me.”

Who dared to battle him?

Just look at Mi Wenbai! He still had yet to regain consciousness!

No one opposed him, so everything was settled.

Ling Jianxue walked over, and asked, “Father, you’re not some kind of raw stone appraisal grandmaster, so why are you randomly acting with such conviction?”

In fact, he had also invited a raw stone appraisal grandmaster over. After all, it was possible that the veins of ores would be worthless, so they naturally had to pick the most valuable ones.

However, Ling Han’s decision bypassed the raw stone appraisal grandmaster, and left him with nothing to do. The grandmaster continued to murmur that Ling Han was acting far too wilfully.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Ignore him.”

How could he be acting willfully? The two veins of ore that he had chosen were the most valuable ones. However, it had to be said that all 10 veins of ore were fairly decent, with not a single one of them being worthless.

The next day, they all started to mine the veins of ore.

There wasn’t much personnel to use, so they all had no option but to do the hard work themselves. What did it matter that they were Heavenly Venerates? They still had to mine the ore personally.

Moreover, they had already reached an agreement. Each person would keep whatever they unearthed. Everything would be down to luck.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t hold back. In any case, if it weren’t for him, these people wouldn’t have even received a single vein of ore. He walked from one side of the mine to the other, drawing a large amount of valuable raw stone into his Spatial Celestial Tool.

After his comprehensive scan, even though there were still some raw stones left, how could there be anything of great value?

Everyone felt a sense of frustration. After digging for half a day, why could they only find Divine Metal?

Meanwhile, their opponents would obtain supreme Great Herbs from time to time. Even though they were only blue-colored or purple-colored, this was still enough to fill them with envy.

This was all Ling Han’s fault! Why had he insisted on picking these two veins of ore?

However, they didn’t dare to say anything. Yet, the raw stone appraisal grandmaster that they had invited wasn’t afraid to speak his mind at all. His standing was transcendent, so taking advantage of their reliance on him, he continued to scold Ling Han again and again.

This ticked Ling Feifan off, so he grabbed the grandmaster and gave him a good pummeling.

No one stood up for the raw stone appraisal grandmaster. Even though it was Ling Feifan who had acted, who didn’t know that this was at Ling Han’s behest? In any case, even if this were Ling Feifan’s personal decision, he was still Ling Han’s grandson, after all, so who dared to target Ling Feifan?

This infuriated the raw stone appraisal grandmaster, who eventually stormed off in rage.

With Ling Han’s current standing, he naturally wouldn’t pay attention to what a raw stone appraisal grandmaster thought of him. If he were annoyed, he could easily smash him to death with a single punch. Right now, however, he was entirely focused on the raw stones that he had unearthed. He was extremely satisfied.

He silently made riches as he opened up the raw stones. In the end, he obtained over 20 Great Herbs and seven Heavenly Venerable Seals. However, it was a shame that he already possessed all of them.

Thus, he gave all seven of these Heavenly Venerable Seals to his son. Along with these, he also gave him some Great Herbs.

“Father, you obtained all of these?” Ling Jianxue asked in astonishment.

Ling Han nodded in reply.

F*ck! Who dared to accuse his father of acting wilfully? This was already more than the sum of what their opposition had obtained from the eight veins of ore!

Because they only had two veins of ore, it wasn’t long before they finished cleaning them up. Now, everyone would head over to the other side to take a peek every day. Even if they couldn’t obtain these treasures, they could at least have a feast for their eyes.

Comparing their gains, however, they couldn’t help but feel angry. Was there any comparison?

They grumbled in frustration, and this caused those on Mi Wenbai’s side to roar with laughter. Even though they had lost two matches, and therefore lost two veins of ore, Ling Han’s wilful decision had caused the other side to directly obtain the two least valuable veins of ore. This was equivalent to Ling Han giving them a big present.

This naturally caused Ling Han to become the butt of their jokes. At the same time, he was also blamed by his own “allies.” However, Ling Han and his son and grandson remained silent as they bathed in the riches themselves. There was no need to tell everyone about this, was there?

Moreover, everyone believed that he was a fool when it came to stone gambling, so perhaps he could still screw more people over?

After a while, something unexpected occurred. After all 10 veins of ore were mined, another vein of ore surprisingly appeared underground.

This vein of ore had been hidden underneath the 10 other veins of ore, which had acted as somewhat of a jacket.

One had to realize that Heavenly Venerable Stone could block the divine sense of Heavenly Venerates, so none of them had been able to detect this vein of ore. Even Ling Han had been unable to detect it. It was only when he saw it that he came to a sudden realization.

However, there was only a single vein of ore, so whom would it belong to?

Having seen Ling Han’s strength, their opponents naturally didn’t suggest another battle to settle things.

Mi Wenbai and his companions wracked their brains thinking about how to obtain this vein of ore.

Eventually, they settled on a stone gambling competition with Ling Han.

Everyone knew that only Celestial Kings could become raw stone appraisal grandmasters. This was because Heavenly Venerable Stones had a special obstructive property against Heavenly Venerates. As if detested by heaven and earth, Heavenly Venerates were unable to become raw stone appraisal grandmasters.

Of course, Heavenly Venerates weren’t too annoyed by this. After all, Heavenly Venerable Stones only existed in this one place, so there would eventually come a day when they managed to mine all of them.

...

Mi Wenbai and the others’ suggestion of a stone gambling competition was naturally met with fierce opposition from the red-haired man. After all, there wasn’t a raw stone appraisal grandmaster among them—Ling Han had already caused him to storm off in rage. Thus, how could they compete?

He insisted on settling things through a battle.

Both parties refused to budge. This was until Ling Han spoke, accepting the proposal of a stone gambling competition.

If they wanted to settle things through a battle, he would refuse to step forward. Thus, the red-haired man and the others naturally had no option but to accept this compromise. Apart from Ling Han, who else could suppress Mi Wenbai?

But a stone gambling competition?

Sigh…

None of them held any hope. This was already a guaranteed loss.

However, what could they do? Ling Han was so domineering, so who would dare to oppose him?

“How are we going to do this stone gambling competition?” Ling Jianxue asked on Ling Han’s behalf.

“We’ll each pick three raw stones to put forward. We’ll then compare their total value,” those on Mi Wenbai’s side said.

“Very well,” Ling Jianxue said, agreeing to these conditions on Ling Han’s behalf.

...

Mi Wenbai and the others immediately sent out their raw stone appraisal grandmaster. Everyone referred to him as “Grandmaster Qian,” with his full name being Qian Wang. He was at the Ninth Heaven, yet all of the Heavenly Venerates treated him as an esteemed guest. He was truly living a grand life.

Qian Wang was extremely aloof, and he said to Ling Han, “I don’t bully others, so I’ll allow you to pick 10 raw stones to compete with me.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This was extremely arrogant, yet it was perfectly in line with the demeanor of raw stone appraisal grandmasters. They were far too spoiled at this moment.

Ling Han didn’t mind this, and he said with a faint smile, “Sure thing!”
