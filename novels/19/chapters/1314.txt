Chapter 1315 Collecting the essence divine flames

A bizarre scene appeared.

The black-colored divine flame actually surged out continuously from Chi Huangji’s body as if something was tugging at it. In that one instant, the essence divine flames had completely slipped out of Chi Huangji’s body, and were entwined around Ling Han.

“No...!” Chi Huangji involuntarily exclaimed in shock. This was not something that he had done on purpose, wanting to use even stronger divine flames to burn Ling Han to ash. It was rather a mysterious force that had pulled the divine flames out by force.

But, how could this be possible?

The essence divine flames were a force that belonged to the heaven and earth; they were the most ancient and strongest existence. Aside from other essence divine objects, what else could be a match for them? Even if Ling Han also possessed some essence divine object, they would only be an equal match. Why was it that he could pull out his divine flames from his body by force?

This was practically an overwhelming advantage! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Chi Huangji was really in a panic, because he did not understand the situation. Ordinarily, the essence divine flames were the very most awesome existence, whether it was in the Immortal Realm or the Netherworld. Could it be... that Ling Han had a precious treasure that surpassed these two Realms?

In reality... it was indeed so!

When he was attacked by the essence divine flames, Ling Han did not care much. After all, divine flames would also be weakened to Mountain River Tier in this place, and he was one who had been burnt by immortal flames. This was naturally a piece of cake for him.

Yet Small Tower suddenly sent him a mental message, telling him not to resist, because it wanted to draw away this divine flame.

Ling Han naturally cooperated. With them drawn into the Black Tower, wouldn’t they then become his?

Thus, he stood there without moving, and allowed Chi Huangji to barrage him with divine flames. And the Black Tower indeed moved, forcibly drawing all the divine flames out of Chi Huangji’s body by force.

“That’s right. It is indeed a Source Power, and can allow me to recover by a ten thousandth.” Small Tower declared with slight happiness.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han immediately countered, “Hey, hey, hey. What you mean is you are planning to take them all for yourself?”

“I was the one who drew them out in the first place, so of course they are mine.” Small Tower was not the slightest bit embarrassed. “Moreover, only if I completely recovered would I be able to deceive the heaven and earth so you would still be able to hide the secret of the Black Tower when you enter into the Celestial Realm in future.”

“That’s plain robbery!” Ling Han’s heart ached. They were essence divine flames; just from the name, he knew they were good stuff.

“Don’t grumble so much, coordinate with me quickly!” Small Tower demanded. Though it could stimulate the Black Tower into destroying and razing the heaven and earth, that would also draw the notice of the Celestial Realm, so it needed Ling Han’s cooperation.

“I can cooperate, but you have to give me a little profit.” Ling Han bargained. This tsundere tower was also without conscience, so it was impossible to squeeze anything out of it without putting up a fight.

“...Fine!” Small Tower hesitated, and finally agreed reluctantly.

The man and tower cooperated, beginning to collect these essence divine flames.

Black Tower was completely capable of doing it alone, but to do it without letting off any aura required Ling Han’s cooperation. That was because this place restricted the cultivation level of all existences, and Ling Han was one who had survived the immortal flame.

Hong, Ling Han’s hands stretched out of the black flames, and formed a hand sign. Hu, he opened his mouth, and these divine flames were instantly swallowed into his mouth.

“Give it back to me!” Chi Huangji was boiling with fury, and hurriedly rushed forwards to snatch them back. They were one of his most important trump cards, so how could he simply sit by and watch as Ling Han snatched them away? In his panic, he did not ponder the question of how Ling Han actually managed to collect the essence divine flames.

The Stone Emperor and the others were all frozen, looking on dumbfounded.

Were they really essence divine flames? Wasn’t it said that even a Saint could be burnt with a single touch? How could it now be drawn back and forth between the two of them?

As Ling Han moved to exchange blows with Chi Huangji, he continued to endlessly absorb the divine flames with the technique that Small Tower had taught him.

Pitifully, these essence divine flames still planned to fight back, but it was completely impossible that they could oppose the control of the Black Tower. Wasting effort, they formed various shapes, yet they were swallowed bit by bit by Ling Han.

It looked like they had entered into Ling Han’s mouth, but in truth, they were immediately absorbed by the Black Tower. After all, the essence divine flames were filled with enmity towards him, so it was completely impossible that they would fuse with him. Instead, they wanted to burn him to nothing, so if they truly entered his body, it would definitely not be a good thing.

Being able to bear the might of the divine flames and letting the divine flames burn inside one’s body were completely two different things.

As he saw how the divine flames became smaller and smaller, Chi Huangji was anxious, furious, and panicking all at the same time. He exploded with even greater battle prowess, wanting to stop Ling Han from “swallowing” his divine flames.

“Die! Die! Die!” Chi Huangji roared loudly. Since his birth, he had never lost his composure as much as he did in this instant.

It couldn’t be helped, though. This was a trump card that he depended on the most.

“Sorry, but whatever has entered my pocket would be mine,” Ling Han said smilingly. With Small Tower acting, the rate at which the Black Tower was swallowing was becoming faster and faster.

It was not taking so much time because the Black Tower was not working hard enough. On the contrary, Small Tower was controlling the absorption rate to prevent it from being too fast, for it could cause the aura of the Black Tower to leak.

“Bastard!” Chi Huangji finally drew his Saint Tool. The ancient mirror appeared, and boom, a fiery dragon appeared in the mirror, roaring as it surged towards Ling Han.

When he saw this Saint Tool, the North Emperor’s expression involuntarily darkened. Though he was a magnanimous man, seeing this God Tool that had defeated himself still caused a ripple in his emotions. After all, it was not Chi Huangji who had defeated him, but rather this Saint Tool.

Weng, the Divine Demon Sword appeared, and Ling Han gripped it in his hand, slashing out towards that dragon of fire.

Over 100 sword projections swept past, and that fire dragon was instantly reduced to pieces, without the slightest bit of might left.

“Hmm?”

The North Emperor and the others all looked stunned, turning their eyes towards the Divine Demon Sword in Ling Han’s grasp.

The might of a Saint Tool was obvious to all, but it seemed like this sword of Ling Han’s was even stronger than a Saint Tool!

Gasp!

In this place where cultivation levels were equal, Saint Tools would definitely be stronger than other God Tools. However, this sword of Ling Han’s was even stronger, and that meant... this was also a Saint Tool, and its grade was even higher.

After all, Saints were divided into four cultivation levels, so Saint Tools naturally would be divided into four levels.

This... Had they seen a ghost?

A Saint Tool couldn’t possibly appear under normal conditions, yet now they appeared one after another as if they were as common as Level 4 or 5 God Tools.

Hu, the Black Tower swallowed the last bit of divine flame, and Ling Han also closed his mouth, revealing an expression of satisfaction.

He looked at Chi Huangji, his eyes filled with admiration. He was fond of these people with nature-defying good fortune. What was theirs would be his, and it could save him quite a lot of effort.

Chi Huangji, though, was fuming as he exclaimed, “Return my divine flame to me!”

“Don’t be so petty, we all can—” Ling Han had just spoken a few words when his expression drastically changed. That was because Small Tower had already refined those essence divine flames, and it had indeed gave him a portion as per their agreement.

However, this portion was not even the share of a ten thousandth.

It couldn’t screw him over like this!

F***, this robbing tower, tricking even him!

“Small!! Tower!!” Ling Han roared through his divine sense.

“What are you shouting for, my ears are not bad.” Small Tower humphed.

“You’re just giving me this little bit?” Ling Han asked angrily. The one putting his life on the line was him, but he actually didn’t even get much profit out of it. This was really too much.
