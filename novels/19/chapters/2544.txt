Chapter 2545: Descendant of the He Clan

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hu, a large gust of wind was blowing over from ahead of them.

This hurricane was extraordinarily huge. Even the eye of the storm had a diameter of several hundred meters. That seal in the center was partly hidden and partly visible, exuding a terrifying aura.

Everyone wanted to dodge, but their speed in these wild winds was slow in the first place, and that hurricane was extremely fast, and covered a wide area, so how could they possibly manage to avoid it?

Hu, hu, hu.?So what if they were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? They were easily caught up in the winds, and pushed skywards, then were swiftly thrown outwards, and all of them were sent flying far.

The Imperial Void Celestial King and the large black dog were still fine as they immediately steadied their footing, but it was not the case for the others. Being blown by the gales, they were all directly sent flying out of this area.

Seeing this situation, the Imperial Void Celestial King and the large black dog also retreated. If it was just the two of them, that definitely would not be enough to activate the formation eye. Even if they walked to the end, it would be pointless.

“As expected of one who can break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.” The Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t help but admit he was impressed. “He should not have been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but rather a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate already. Just now, I felt like I was being attacked by more than a dozen Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings at the same time, and that was why I lost my footing.

“By the looks of it, we cannot force our way through.”

Even the Imperial Void Celestial King was saying this, so it was definite that just forging onwards was clearly a very foolish idea.

“Wally, can you deduce a safe course?” Everyone looked towards Wally, and even the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had to bow their heads.

Wally looked ahead, his eyes flashing with light continuously. Clearly, some kind of calculation was taking place, but after half a day, he shook his head. “There is no rhythm that can be traced.”

What were they to do now? Even Wally had no idea what to do; could it be that they could only just guess blindly?

“It is impossible that there is no solution!” Liu Yufei asserted defiantly. For the sake of this ancient site, she had sacrificed endless energy and effort. If there was no choice but to beat a retreat now, how could she possibly be willing?

“Hehe, there naturally is a solution.” A voice suddenly rang out from behind them.

Everyone turned their heads, and saw a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had suddenly appeared behind them. He had the appearance of a middle-aged man, carrying an extraordinary bearing.

This was very normal. One that could become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had to be a monarch tier, at least, so they naturally had an amazing presence.

Liu Yufei’s expression immediately changed drastically. She recognized who this person was. He was He Runhai. Throughout these 700,000 years, she had always been by his side, initially taking him as her master, which was followed by an ambiguous relationship, something between a romantic relationship and the pure relationship of master and disciple. Their relationship could not be revealed to others. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“And you are, sir?” The Imperial Void Celestial King clasped his hands, greeting the other man.

He Runhai smiled slightly, and did not take a second look at Liu Yufei. He replied, “I am He Runhai.”

He?

Everyone was slightly stunned. The owner of this ancient site also had the surname of He. Furthermore, why was He Runhai only here by himself? To open the great doors of the ancient site, it needed the lifeblood of more than a dozen supreme monarch stars.

“That’s right. The owner of this ancient site is my ancestor,” He Runhai admitted outright, making no move to hide this fact.

‘As expected.’

However, there was first Liu Yufei, who seemed very knowledgeable about the situation here, and now there was this direct descendant of Celestial King, He Feng. The whole affair seemed to have become even more complicated.

Only then did He Runhai look towards Liu Yufei, and ask, “Disciple, why aren’t you coming out to greet your master?”

Liu Yufei’s expression shifted back and forth, and then she finally smiled brightly. “Master, you have always been busy with cultivation, hoping to become even a tiny bit stronger than before. How could I dare to disturb you?”

The two of them were master and disciple?

No wonder Liu Yufei was so familiar with the situation here. She had to have obtained this intel from the descendant of He Feng. What she had said about an ancient book was just a complete lie.

However, they had never trusted Liu Yufei, either, so the group did not show much reaction to this revelation. After all, they weren’t close friends that had to be absolutely honest with one another.

“What do you say, Brother He? Do you intend to chase us out of here?” the Imperial Void Celestial King asked.

He Runhai smiled. “If I had wanted to chase you all out of here, then why would I have shown myself? If I did not act here, even if you all have cultivated to Ninth Heaven, and combined forces, it would still be useless.

“However, to be honest, what my ancestor has laid out is to test the descendants of our He Clan in the first place. Only when there are enough supreme monarch stars that are produced from our clan would we then be able to open the treasure chamber that he has left behind. Unfortunately, how could supreme monarch stars emerge so easily? Not even one would appear once in a few epochs.”

When they heard his words, it seemed like he was not a supreme monarch star.

“Without enough supreme monarch stars, would we be able to activate the remaining stone tablets?” Xu Huan asked.

“Don’t worry. The activation of each formation eye would need fewer supreme monarch stars than the last, as long as there is someone maintaining its activation by the side,” He Runhai explained.

“Then please use your power, Senior,” everyone said.

He Runhai nodded. He took out a flag, and it was clear that the flag was already half-destroyed. It was stained with blood, exuding a harsh feeling.

“When Ancestor battled all those years ago, he almost died in the most tragic battle. After severe injuries, his subordinates wrapped his body in the battle flag and delivered him back to the clan. Only after 300,000,000 years of being comatose did he regain consciousness.

“And it was precisely that occasion that allowed Ancestor to gain a peek into the amazing secrets of the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and he began to attempt breaking through to that highest level.

“Sigh, I really do not know if it was good luck or bad. Afterwards, though Ancestor had become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, all his effort had still been in vain in the end.”

He Runhai sighed, a hint of pity in his expression.

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were actually already strong enough. Though the number of Heavenly Venerates that had appeared in the Flaming Frost Realm was considerable, that was possible only through gathering the highest tier of elites from countless realms. Put in a single realm, even a high-level dimension would not have too many.

Judging from this aspect, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was indeed awesome.

Everyone did not know what to say. After all, they were having designs on the treasures that his ancestor had left behind.

Thankfully, He Runhai was only musing ruefully, and very soon regained his composure. Shaking out the battle flag, he instantly waved it around strongly. “Stand behind me. As the battle flag flutters, there would be no need to fear the hurricane winds.”

He strode into the winds, and true enough, when the hurricane winds met with the battle flag, they would split aside automatically, as if they had eyes.

Everyone hurriedly followed behind him, walking under the protection of the battle flag.

They advanced steadily. Ling Han looked at either side of them, and could see wild hurricane winds raging madly. All the scenery here was incredibly blurry, and the range of visibility was no more than three meters.

“Damn dog, be careful. This He Runhai seems to have been waiting for us here. I keep feeling like there is something off about him.” Ling Han communicated with the large black dog through divine sense.

“Grandpa Dog knows.” The large black dog did not reveal anything. “However, I can tell that he, too, indeed wants what his ancestor has left behind. Let’s just wait and see who is stronger here, then.

“Moreover, the relationship between Liu Yufei and this master of hers seems to be quite strange too.”

Ling Han nodded. He had the Dimension Scroll, and at crucial times, it could be taken out as an intimidation tactic. Worse come to worst, he could draw out a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier heavenly tribulation, and why not see who would not be afraid?

Originally, this area could not be traversed at all, but with this descendant of He Feng holding his battle flag as protection, it had become the easiest stage. Only a day later, they arrived at the end of this area.

As expected, there was also a stone tablet erected here.

Everyone rubbed some of their blood on it, and the hurricane winds immediately stopped. Though the haze had not dispersed, the range of visibility had still greatly increased.

“Who will stay behind?”
