Chapter 1136: I’ll Kill Him If I Want To

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The combined power of Zhang Tong and his replica of the Emerald Cliff Cauldron was actually unable to suppress Ling Han!

This...!

One had to realize that Zhang Tong had once been a key disciple. However, he had been easily defeated by someone now. Didn’t this mean that... Ling Han possessed the strength of a seed?

Gasp!

How were they to believe this!

“W-who on earth are you?” Zhang Tong knew that he had kicked an iron plate.

“The person who’ll kill you!” Ling Han replied. He swung a fist toward Zhang Tong, and the fist was so magnificent that even heaven and earth lost their luster.

Zhang Tong didn’t dare face this attack head on. He gritted his teeth and turned around to run.

He had fled!

Arrogant as Zhang Tong was, he had been forced to flee after exchanging just two strikes with Ling Han!

The onlookers could barely believe their eyes. Thinking about it carefully, however, Zhang Tong had been forced onto his back foot during both of the exchanges. He had even activated his replica Emerald Cliff Cauldron the second time around, yet this had failed to turn the tables in his favor. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That being the case, why would he stay to fight?

Ling Han smiled faintly. He snapped his fingers, and soaring sword intent transformed into a streak of light that shot toward Zhang Tong.

The ensuing sword light was as quick as light.

Zhang Tong raised his arms to block, yet how could he block something that was traveling at the speed of light?

Pu!

The sword light slammed into his back and violently ripped him into two pieces.

The onlookers wet their pants in fright. Someone as powerful as Zhang Tong had been sliced in two by a casual sword light attack resulting from a snap of that person’s fingers?

Ling Han was extremely satisfied. His strike had been a combination of the Fast Technique and the power of Regulations, and it was because of this that it had been so quick and powerful. However, the Fast Technique by itself would be quicker, while the power of Regulation by itself would be more damaging.

He had indeed combined these two techniques together. However, it was also clear that he hadn’t unleashed the full potential of either of the two foundation techniques.

This was good news. This signified that the combination technique could still become stronger!

Meanwhile, Zhang Tong still wasn’t dead yet. The vitality of Mountain River Tier cultivators was tremendous, and Zhang Tong extended his arms to piece the two halves of his body back together. He furiously channeled his Origin Power in order to prevent excessive blood loss as he did this. His vitality would suffer a huge blow if he lost too much blood.

He coughed blood, and said, “Sir, don’t you think you’re going too far? You have to realize that my master is Yang Hao!”

“I know,” Ling Han said with a nod. However, he immediately launched another sword light toward him.

‘F*ck!’

Zhang Tong swore in his mind. ‘What the f*ck do you know?! I’ve already said that Yang Hao is my master, yet you still dare to attack?!’

The crowd suddenly erupted into a frenzy at this moment. This commotion wasn’t just traveling through the spectators of this battle, but rather through everyone at the foot of the mountain. There were at least 100,000 people calling out together, and this instantly gave rise to noise that shook heaven and earth.

This was because... the seeds who were planning to pick followers had finally arrived!

Everyone had been waiting for this moment, so they naturally shouted at the top of their lungs in order to attract the attention of the seeds. They hoped that the seeds would favor them and thus select them as a follower.

A total of 20 seeds had arrived, with the men being handsome and the women being beautiful. They were all extremely young, yet all of them exuded a powerful aura.

A youth in green humphed coldly, and said, “Humph, what a bunch of trash! Why do I have to select trash to follow by my side?” He appeared especially arrogant.

He was only at the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier, and this cultivation level definitely couldn’t be considered high. However, the fact that he had become a seed of the Majestic Heaven Sect revealed that he definitely possessed a supreme talent. The sect had taken a fancy to his potential, not his current cultivation level.

“I second that! Let’s go back!” a young woman said. There was a dab of cinnabar on her forehead, and this made her appear even more beautiful.

“Huh? It seems like there’s a commotion over there!” A red-robed male suddenly pointed toward the location of Ling Han and Zhang Tong’s battle.

“That’s... Zhang Tong!” the youth in green said. However, a look of displeasure instantly spread across his face, and he said, “Someone actually dares to provoke the follower of Senior Brother Yang? I need to see who has such gall!”

He leaped up and dashed toward the location of Ling Han and Zhang Tong.

The crowd instantly parted to let him pass. Who dared to ask to be his follower at this moment? Doing so would be to seek a beating!

The youth in green observed the situation, and immediately shouted, “Stop!”

“Young Master Fu!” Zhang Tong shouted in excitement. It was as if he had seen his savior.

He was a seed! He would definitely be safe if Young Master Fu stood up for him.

Pu!

However, his excitement had come too early. Ling Han showed no signs of stopping, and he immediately unleashed another burst of sword light that smashed his head into bits. This time, Zhang Tong’s divine sense was ruthlessly obliterated. Even Genesis Tier Saints wouldn’t be able to revive him.

“You...” The youth trembled in fury. He had already shouted at him to stop, yet that person had actually ignored him!

How audacious! He deserved to die 10,000 times over!

“Are you going to end your own life, or do I have to help you end it?” he said coldly.

“Dumb c*nt!” Ling Han sneered. He then continued to walk forward.

“Very well... Very well!” The youth in green pointed at Ling Han, yet Ling Han simply walked past him as if he didn’t exist. This infuriated him even more, and he extended an arm to grab at Ling Han. “Do you know who I am? I’m Fu Liangye! The imperial grandson of the Great Heaven Majestic Empire!”

Ling Han didn’t turn around, and instead simply snapped his fingers.

Pa!

A bloody hole instantly appeared on Fu Liangye’s palm.

“Ahhh...!” he shrieked in pain.

The surrounding people all became pale with fright. This person was a little too fearless, wasn’t he?! Not only had he killed Yang Hao’s follower because he had wanted to, but he had even attacked and wounded a seed.

“How brave of you!” Fu Liangye said with a dark expression. “You’re taking advantage of your higher cultivation level to bully me, aren’t you?”

He was only at the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier, so there was no way he could battle against a cultivator at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, regardless of how prodigious he was.

He had only dared to stand out because of his special status—he was a seed of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and also the imperial grandson of the Great Heaven Majestic Empire.

Ling Han ignored him and continued to walk forward. He was heading where the other seeds were all standing.

He could already see that person, the target of his trip.

She was the Ninth King—Hu Feiyun.

This absent-minded woman was currently dozing off, and it was as if she hadn’t had enough sleep. She was starkly different from the other mighty and haughty-appearing seeds.

Ling Han truly didn’t understand how she had been chosen as a seed.

After being wounded by Ling Han, Fu Liangye didn’t target him anymore. In any case, this was the territory of the Majestic Heaven Sect, so there was nowhere that Ling Han could run. He followed Ling Han through the crowd, eventually arriving back at where he had just been.

“Humph! Dogs should remain where dogs should remain! Is this a place that you can come to?” the young woman with the dab of cinnabar on her forehead scolded. Her face was filled with utter contempt.

She was Gan Shiyun, a member of the Gan Clan from the Hundred Bird Majestic Empire of the Peace Gate Planet. The Gan Clan was a super-powerful force of the Hundred Bird Majestic Empire, and they even possessed elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Even the imperial family had to appease them through marriages.

Thus, Gan Shiyun was, in effect, no different from a princess. This naturally resulted in her becoming incredibly haughty.

Although she was beautiful, her beauty was nothing compared to Shui Yanyu’s. In fact, Shui Yanyu’s disposition was countless times more attractive than hers. Not to mention, Ling Han had spent two years alone with Empress Luan Xing. What other beauty could still attract his gaze?

He ignored her words and headed straight for Hu Feiyun.

“Detestable!” Gan Shiyun said with a cold humph. She waved her hand and summoned a whip before immediately whipping it at Ling Han. Divine patterns glowed in the air. It was evident that this whip was a God Tool.

Her cultivation level was much higher than that of Fu Liangye—she was at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier!

The might of her whip strike was astounding.
