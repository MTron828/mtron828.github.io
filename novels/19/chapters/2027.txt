Chapter 2028: Blood Sacrifice

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I never go back on my words.”

Xiao Jun and the others couldn’t help but shudder. This was because the Eighth Lotus elite started to wail in agony as Ling Han spoke. At the same time, his body was being corroded at a rate that was visible to the naked eye.

If he had resolutely abandoned his physical body at the first instance, his divine sense could have still survived. At that time, he could have looked for a new body to possess.

However, he hadn’t fathomed the devastating nature of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo, and he had dared to struggle against it with his own cultivation. His decision was an act of seeking death.

In just a few seconds, a mighty Immortal Palace Tier elite had already been reduced to nothing more than a puddle of blood. Both his physical body and divine sense were annihilated.

Was this not petrifying?

“Wh-what in the world did you do?” Xiao Jun asked in a trembling voice.

He had always been a calm and composed person. Even after losing to Ling Han that time, he had immediately come up with a way to deal with the situation. He had admitted his loss and minimized the questioning of his authority. Now, however, he was completely shaken by the scene before him. He couldn’t calm down no matter what.

That was an Eighth Lotus elite! Yet, he had actually been killed by Ling Han in a single strike! This was simply inconceivable!

Ling Han wore a wide smile, and he said, “You people have your deity, and I naturally have mine as well. Just then, I drew on the power of my deity. In comparison, the deity of you people is only so-so. In fact, I can instantly kill an elite one major tier above me. Sigh!”

He shook his head with an expression of utter disdain.

Xiao Jun and the others were enraged upon hearing this. However, they couldn’t say anything in retort.

They couldn’t argue against reality.

“Kill all of the outsiders! Begin a blood sacrifice!” Lan Tianyang’s voice suddenly traveled over.

‘What?!’

Everyone was shocked upon hearing this.

The guests of the island were shocked because they hadn’t imagined that the islanders would suddenly turn against them. After all, hadn’t their relationship been cordial just a moment ago? They had fought a beast tide together, and they had even agreed to pray to the deity together. In the future, they would have become like family.

Meanwhile, the residents of the island were also deeply astonished. Their island master was actually going to conduct a blood sacrifice!

This was their final trump card.

After conducting a blood sacrifice, the two deity statues would temporarily provide one with more impressive power. However, when this blessing expired, the blessed person would immediately suffer severe wounds. Thus, this was a final trump card.

With them ordering a blood sacrifice, did this mean that Lan Tianyang and Che Yuanhua were also facing grave danger?

“Hurry up! What are you still standing around for?!” Lan Tianyang roared. He and Che Yuanhua were already on the verge of collapse. Xiao Gu was an undying freak, so if their battle continued, they would definitely be killed.

Xiao Jun and the others were immediately shaken back to their senses. They then glared at the outsiders with baleful and murderous expressions.

Blood sacrifice—such a sacrificial offering naturally needed more than just fresh blood. It also needed life. In reality, vitality was the most essential ingredient of a blood sacrifice. The more vitality a blood sacrifice received, the more powerful the blood sacrifice would be.

“Die!” Xiao Jun and the others roared as they charged at Qin Wei and the other outsiders.

However, everyone avoided Ling Han as if in tacit understanding.

They didn’t dare to attack him.

He had killed an Eighth Lotus elite with a single strike, and he had also killed a large number of other cultivators in the process. As such, who dared to attack him? In fact, they didn’t even dare to approach him. They avoided him to the best of their ability.

Ling Han involuntarily stroked his chin. Was he that frightening?

“Aaah!” The islanders launched a furious assault, and there were several Eighth Lotus elites among them. These elites were equivalent to Immortal Palace Tier elites. Meanwhile, Qin Wei was the only Immortal Palace Tier elite among the outsiders. That being the case, how could they resist the vicious attack of the islanders?

Pu, pu, pu!

Several people were immediately killed. They were violently beheaded, causing fountains of blood to spray into the sky.

With each person they killed, the islanders would make a strange pose. It was as if they were praying, yet it was also as if they were dancing.

This was a ritual of the blood sacrifice.

Weng!

The two stone statues suddenly underwent a peculiar change. Like a drought being ended by rain, they were instantly filled with renewed vitality.

The blood sacrifice was working.

Che Yuanhua’s and Lan Tianyang’s battle prowess instantly shot up by a noticeable amount. This allowed them to escape from the perilous situation and catch a breath. If they became even stronger, it was genuinely possible that they could turn the tables and suppress Xiao Gu instead. They naturally couldn’t kill him, but they could at least subdue him and buy time for the islanders to retreat.

Ling Han immediately frowned. He didn’t want to let these people flee.

He had to sabotage this blood sacrifice.

“Young Master Ling, save me!” An outsider fought their way over, and they begged Ling Han to save them.

Some islanders had been pursuing them, yet upon noticing Ling Han, they immediately stopped in their tracks. They were terrified of this demon.

Ling Han glanced at the person before him, only to discover that this was the person who had sold him out before.

He couldn’t help but feel astonished. Just how shameless was this person?

Whoosh!

Upon seeing someone successfully “escaping”, many others also fought their way over. They treated Ling Han as a protective cover.

These people... Most of them had been loudly criticizing Ling Han just then.

Moreover, after temporarily escaping, these people didn’t even offer a word of thanks to Ling Han.

In their eyes, they were all outsiders, so it was only natural that Ling Han offered a helping hand, no?

Ling Han shook his head. These people were truly a bunch of trash. Their existence was a shame to this world.

Since he couldn’t let these people be killed for the blood sacrifice, he was willing to become a demon himself.

Boom!

Ling Han launched a punch, sending flames soaring into the sky. The person who had sold him out was instantly reduced to ashes.

‘F*cking hell! Do you people think I’m a saint?

‘You think I’ll repay evil with good?

‘Am I stupid?!’

“Ling Han, what are you doing?!”

“We’ve all come from the same place!”

“You’re completely inhumane!”

“Young Master Ling, spare me!”

The outsiders all exclaimed in shock. Some were scolding Ling Han, while others were begging for their life. At the end of the day, they were all seeking to live.

“What a bunch of trash. You don’t deserve to live in this world,” Ling Han said with a cold expression. As he said this, his palm lashed out again.

If these people had shown just a tiny bit more righteousness and courage while on the island, he wouldn’t have minded drawing them into his Spatial God Tool. He would have offered a helping hand.

Now, however?

‘Hurry up and die, trash. Please don’t cause me any more trouble.’ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The outsiders hurriedly started to flee. However, to their despair, they discovered that they were trapped between a tiger and a pack of wolves. Death was the only fate awaiting them.

“Aaah!” Wails of agony were incessant as the outsiders were killed one after another.

Ling Han didn’t feel a shred of sympathy. His heart of kindness had already been worn away by these people.

‘Die!’

His heart was like steel as he unleashed the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords. Fusing this attack with his Source Power of Metal, he was able to unleash an unfathomably devastating attack. Even an Earth Soul elite would be instantly killed if they were scraped by this attack.

However, there were several Eighth Lotus elites among the islanders, after all, so several outsiders were still killed and offered for sacrifice by them. Che Yuanhua’s and Lan Tianyang’s battle prowess instantly rose by an explosive amount.

However, this still wasn’t enough. Even after all of the outsiders had been killed, their battle prowess was still insufficient to suppress Xiao Gu.

“More! Sacrifice more!” Lan Tianyang yelled in a shrill voice.

Sacrifice more? Whom could they still kill?

Ling Han was the only remaining outsider. To say nothing of whether they could kill him, even if they could, a single person wouldn’t make much difference to the blood sacrifice.

That being the case, whom did Lan Tianyang want them to kill?

They could only kill their own members.

Xiao Jun’s expression became ice-cold, and he roared, “You heard Island Master!”

Several Eighth Lotus elites instantly lashed out, mercilessly killing those beside them.

Pu, pu, pu!
