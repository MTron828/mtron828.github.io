Chapter 2128: Looking for someone familiar

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was yet another small-scale skirmish.

Ascending Origin Tier elites would deliver a token assault, and Immortal Palace Tier, Dividing Soul Tier, and Severing Mundane Tier Celestials would be tailing behind them. However, there was an extremely large number of troops, displaying the detailed power of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force.

Ling Han ran with the masses, calling out loudly a few times. Seeing the exaggerated expression on his face, others would think that he had some kind of deadly grudge against the Roc Palace. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Brother, we are just cannon fodder, and this is above our pay grade. You don’t have to be so serious, right?” Someone by his side could not bear to watch. How were they supposed to live with that?

“Really?” Ling Han chuckled. “My mistake, my mistake. I overperformed.”

“That’s right. As the saying goes, the hunter will shoot the bird that sticks out. With you shouting and howling like this, if you were spotted by those damn women from the Roc Palace, they may lock onto you and hunt you down. Do you think that you are as strong as a Dividing Soul Tier?” This person was well aware of the pros and cons.

Ling Han’s purpose was actually just to attract the attention of those “damn women”. There were a great many people that had welcomed Hu Niu back to the Celestial Realm. Only one of them needed to appear, and they would definitely be able to recognize him.

Thus, he only kept a “low profile” for a while, and then immediately became energetic again, yelling and shouting loudly.

The troops of both sides rapidly closed in on each other, and then erupted in a great battle.

Basically, this kind of battle would take place in the air. Usually, Ascending Origin Tiers would battle fiercely at the highest point, and then Immortal Palace Tiers would be at a slightly lower point, followed by Dividing Soul Tiers, and finally it would be Severing Mundane Tiers at the lowest point. Basically, that was at a point that was just a few dozen meters above the ground.

The environment here was extremely sturdy. Thus, even if a maximum-scale battle royale broke out here, it would still be unable to crumble the mountains. Otherwise, this place would have long since been flattened.

“Die, you villain!” A woman from the Roc Palace had locked on Ling Han, a pair of wings flapping behind her back as she rapidly charged over towards Ling Han.

Celestials could fly, and after she possessed this pair of wings, her speed had also considerably soared. Practically in just the blink of an eye, she had appeared in front of Ling Han, her sword waving out in a sweeping slash.

Those with the bloodline of the Roc were naturally experts of Regulations of Space.

Ling Han had no intention of exposing himself. Thus, he merely condensed his Origin Power on his fist, and parried this strike.

Peng, the two of them were sent flying backwards.

Ling Han had naturally faked it. His figure turned, and charged towards another place, searching for a familiar face—with his memory, even if 10,000,000 years had passed, including the time spent in the Black Tower, everything that had happened in the small world all those years ago were still vivid in his mind.

As long as it was someone that had appeared then, he would definitely be able to recognize her.

“Don’t even think of fleeing!” He had not foreseen that that woman was extremely stubborn. Wielding her sword, she pursued him. She probably had seen how Ling Han had pushed his performance too far, and developed animosity towards him.

Ling Han laughed, and naturally would not stop. Instead, he ran even faster.

Just at this moment, a powerful feeling of danger rose up in him suddenly. He hurriedly stopped, and retreated madly.

As expected, a gaze had focused on him. That was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, who had especially descended downwards to kill such “weaklings” like himself. Just now, if Ling Han had not retreated backwards decisively, he would’ve probably suffered a powerful attack from the former.

“Watch the sword!” The woman from before pursued him, her sword stabbing straight at the back of Ling Han’s head.

Ling Han parried carelessly, pretending to be stuck in a stalemate with the other in battle. Then, he guided the fight to circle around the battlefield endlessly as he continued to look for someone familiar.

“Brother, let’s work together to kill her!”

Coincidentally, the person that had reminded Ling Han not to overperform actually charged over, his hands wielding a golden saber, seven seals of great dao already glowing on it, and endlessly exuding an aura of violence.

His face was filled with killing intent as he brandished his saber in a slash towards that woman.

“How underhanded!” the woman rebuked. She could only turn around and tap out a finger. A Roc flew out, greeting the incoming blow from the golden saber.

Peng, the Roc crashed into the golden saber, instantly causing a burning light to erupt. Seals of great dao rose up one after another, and a fierce collision took place. Then, they canceled each other out.

Her figure trembled, and then four divided souls came out, boosting her battle prowess to the pinnacle.

Ling Han had no intention of lingering in battle, and guided the battle into movement.

This scene looked a little strange. It was clear that he together with the other person had the advantage in numbers, and this person was not weaker than the woman, yet it was he that was fleeing in panic and the woman that was chasing him, while his companion pursued that woman.

“Brother, what are you running for?” The person pursuing behind the woman could not help but call out.

‘F***, you idiot!’

Ling Han cursed in his heart. This scene composed of the three of them was clearly off. It would be fine if you did not shout, but if you did, what were they supposed to do if they attracted the attention of others?

It should be known that Ling Han had a halo of attracting trouble. Usually, even when he did not cause trouble, trouble would still come to him, so what more now?

As expected, the eyes of an elite very quickly swept over, as sharp as a blade, causing Ling Han’s skin to feel as if it was pricked.

This was an Immortal Palace Tier.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. This Immortal Palace Tier elite had clearly become suspicious. Even if he did not suspect that Ling Han was a spy, he would think that Ling Han had cowered, and planned to become a deserter.

How would a deserter end up on the battlefield?

There was a 99% chance they would be killed in front of the troops as an example to the rest and to stabilize the military morale.

Ling Han was exasperated, and could only turn around to battle the woman.

That Immortal Palace Tier elite himself was still battling furiously, but a sliver of divine sense was tagged onto Ling Han. Probably, he would kill Ling Han first at all costs if Ling Han continued to be passive in battle.

Immediately, the woman from the Roc Palace fell into a disadvantage, her circumstances precarious.

“Haha, killing a Dividing Soul Tier would mean 10 merit points!” that companion of Ling Han declared, slightly excited.

Clearly, while these 10 merit points were not a high reward, they seemed to be quite valuable.

And that woman just hated Ling Han to death, so the focus of her assault concentrated on Ling Han, seeming like she was going to drag Ling Han down with her even if it meant her own death.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel speechless. He had not unleashed even ten thousandth of his own strength. Even if he did not fight back at all, his physique was nothing that the woman could penetrate anyways, so why go to all the trouble?

He could not say these words directly, so he could only listlessly parry her blows. As long as that Immortal Palace Tier no longer paid any attention to him, he would continue his search.

But the circumstances of that woman from the Roc Palace were becoming more and more dangerous. She had already been struck a considerable number of times by the golden saber, her body covered with wounds, and her aura had also begun to become unstable.

“Brother, I won’t be reserved then!” Ling Han’s companion’s eyes shone with vicious light, his saber slashing out at that woman’s neck. He had the confidence that her head would be severed with this one slash, and when the power of Regulation infiltrated her body, this enemy would instantly die.

He was the one who had delivered the finishing blow, so the credit would naturally go to him.

That woman could no longer dodge. She was harsh on herself as well. Instead of dodging, wielder and sword moved as one, increasing her speed as she stabbed towards Ling Han.

What kind of brain did she have!

Ling Han shook his head, stretching out his right hand, and picking her up by the back of her neck. Then, with a clap of his left hand,?peng, the golden saber that was delivering a slash from behind was sent flying.

“B-Brother?” The person from Four Seas Palace looked at Ling Han in shock, his mouth twitching slightly.

How could this guy be so strong? But why had he been running all the time previously? It was clear that he could have easily settled the battle just by turning around, right? And he had tried to snatch his credit, so would he then hold a grudge against him?

Who exactly was he!
