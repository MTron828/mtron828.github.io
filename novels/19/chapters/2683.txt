2684 Yun Aokong

The large black dog grabbed the Divine Demon Sword, and looked it over repeatedly, yet ended up shaking his head. “There is no life to it at all anymore.”

He gave a flick with his paw. Pa! A section of the blade fell down just like that, and with a stomp from him, it immediately turned into dust.

This toughness… Just how many times was it inferior to Divine Metal?

Ling Han took the sword from him, and circulated his divine sense carefully through it. As expected, this Divine Sword that had originally been filled with life and sharpness had become dead and heavy. There was not the slightest sliver of reaction from it, and it had also lost the sturdy structure of the Divine Demon Sword. It was loose and lax. To say nothing of Ling Han, even if it was just a three-year-old child, a light tap would probably turn the Divine Demon Sword into the dust of history.

Had it really been so madly struck by the heavenly tribulation that it had been completely finished?

Ling Han could not believe it. He scanned the blade over and over again.

The large black dog sighed, turned, and left. Since the Divine Demon Sword could not advance to become a supreme Heavenly Venerate Tool, then going to get another was not a realistic plan. They could only wait until either one of them broke through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. By then, it would be possible to suppress Heavenborn. However, it was possible that this time would come a considerable number of years later.

Ling Han would not give up. He kept holding onto his faith. The Divine Demon Sword could be considered a secondary body of his, possessing his unique trait of becoming stronger when encountering setbacks. How could it have possibly been struck dead with just a heavenly tribulation?

Three days later, Ling Han’s divine sense had already flowed tens of thousands of times through the Divine Demon Sword. Suddenly, he touched a point.

This point was negligible, and it was extremely easy for him to pass it by in a flash, yet Ling Han discovered that there was a sliver of life left inside this point.

He studied it carefully, and a hint of a smile appeared at the corners of his lips a while later.

This kind of life surpassed Divine Metal!

Though there was just a sliver, it could suppress all in terms of quality.

The Divine Demon Sword had indeed survived the Heavenly Venerate Tribulation, but because it had not had the protection of its master, it had also been incredibly difficult for it to undergo the Heavenly Venerate Tribulation. Paying the price of being practically completely destroyed, the sword had managed to survive. Thus, after undergoing the heavenly tribulation, it had not shone in brilliance. Instead, it was like it had failed to survive the heavenly tribulation, and had directly dropped down from the skies, so everyone thought that it had failed.

But even if it had succeeded, this price was too great. Practically the whole sword had been destroyed and turned into scrap metal.

‘It’s fine. As long as the core is there, it can be repaired!’ Ling Han thought. Even for a cultivator, as long as they had survived the heavenly tribulation, no matter how severe the injuries, they could be healed. By then, their strength would soar and surpass their previous strength completely.

Once the Divine Demon Sword was repaired, it would be a truly supreme Heavenly Venerable Tool, and advance to that strongest level.

Ling Han did not inform the large black dog, and decided to wait until the Divine Demon Sword recovered to give this guy a surprise.

Next, Ling Han began concocting alchemical pills. Since he had already accepted fees from the Wang Clan, he should deliver upon the promised time. Moreover, the Wang Clan had previously supported him even if it meant becoming enemies with the He Clan. Ling Han had to acknowledge this debt.

After working for several months, Ling Han finally completed his mission. When Wang Yangming came, Ling Han asked him about the recent events in the martial academy.

Aside from the fact that He Yufeng had gone to the Realm Battlefield, so had Heavenborn.

Heavenborn was still a Seventh Heaven, but why was he able to go to the Realm Battlefield? That naturally was because his physique was too amazing. His physique was at the level of Divine Metal, and his defenses went all the way up to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Thus, as long as he was being careful, he would still be able to help here and there at the Realm Battlefield at the very least.

Ling Han hesitated; should he go to the Realm Battlefield?

He had not made his decision yet, but the news of his return had already spread out in the martial academy, which also caused some people to pay him a visit.

Just a few days later, a person appeared in front of his abode. It was like someone was about to die; he was banging strongly and loudly at Ling Han’s door.

This was too vulgar.

Ling Han opened the doors, and saw a young man that looked to be in his twenties standing in the doorway. There were four ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him, his vitality very energetic and filled with heroic spirit. This man was very handsome, but it was unfortunate that the pride in his expression was too strong. It was as if he was looking down in disdain on the rest of the world, as if everyone should kneel down in front of him.

“So you are Ling Han?” this young man asked boldly.

Pa!

Ling Han sent a slap right over. How could that young man manage to dodge? Immediately, he was sent to the ground with this strike, passing out completely.

“How rude!” Ling Han shook his head. Though he was using his superior strength to bully someone weaker, and had been the first to make a move, the fact that a mere Fourth Heaven dared to treat an Eighth Heaven Celestial King like this was in itself an act of provocation. Even if he was beaten, he would deserve it. Ling Han had no worries that he had broken the rules of the martial academy.

Moreover, Ling Han was just quietly staying at home, and hadn’t trifled with anyone. Wasn’t the other party just asking to be beaten?

Ling Han slammed the doors shut and returned, continuing to nurture the Divine Demon Sword.

This sword had the same origins as Ling Han. His martial intent could stimulate the recovery of the Divine Demon Sword, and this was something that only he could do.

That young man simply lay like that at Ling Han’s doors. There would be people passing by now and then, and when they saw this, they couldn’t help but feel amused.

“Isn’t that Yun Aokong from the Yun Clan?”

“A Fourth Heaven monarch star, and the Yun Clan has placed very high hopes on him.”

“Why would he be lying here?”

“Isn’t this the abode of Ling Han, that bringer of calamity?”

“Hiss, Yun Aokong must have angered Ling Han, and that is why he has been knocked out.”

“But there doesn’t seem to have been any conflicts between him and Ling Han, right?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I don’t get it.”

When this news spread out, a great many people who had planned to visit Ling Han gave up that idea. How could Ling Han be so overbearing? Even the young master of the Yun Clan was not worthy of entering?

Though Yun Aokong was only a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, the grand elder of the Yun Clan was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Could it be that Ling Han was really related to the Lin Clan? Otherwise, how could he be so domineering?

Yun Aokong only regained consciousness after being out cold for three whole days. He hurriedly scrambled to his feet, his expression slightly dazed, but immediately, he flew into a fury out of humiliation.

He had actually been knocked unconscious here!

Though he did not know how long had passed, it would definitely not have been any short period of time. There were definitely others that had witnessed his embarrassment.

Damn!

Peng, peng, peng! He began knocking on the doors again.

After a while, the doors could finally be seen opening, revealing that face of Ling Han that was filled with impatience.

“Ling Han, you are too arrogant. I am of the Yun Clan—”

Peng!

Ling Han’s hand descended, and another slap knocked Yun Aokong unconscious. He could not be bothered with whatever Yun Clan, Ma Clan, or whatchamacallit. At the moment, his focus was completely on mending the Divine Demon Sword.

There just happened to be people who witnessed this, and the news instantly spread throughout the whole martial academy.

The young master of the Yun Clan had been knocked out at Ling Han’s door two times in a row.

When everyone heard this news, they first erupted into laughter, and then shook their head. Ling Han was truly one who dared to oppose a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; he did not even take the Yun Clan to heart.

True; the He Clan also had a grand elder that was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and Ling Han was still not seen to hold much fear, either.

Another three days later, Yun Aokong slowly came back to his senses.

His whole face was flushed crimson, and his expression darkened.

As the most outstanding heir of the present generation of the Yun Clan, he had naturally grown up under the protection of countless people since childhood. Furthermore, who would not give some face to a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate? Thus, he had never encountered any setbacks before.

But in this place, he had been knocked out before he had even finished speaking, and was just lying at another’s door like that, exposed completely to the elements.

He really was about to go crazy!

However, remembering his mission, Yun Aokong forcefully suppressed his fury. He could not just return miserably like this, after all. Right?

He knocked on the doors again, but he was using much less force this time. He had finally learned his lesson.
