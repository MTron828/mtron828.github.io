Chapter 2412: Blue North King

This was a very realistic threat. The Celestial Kings of the Celestial Realm were unable to enter into the Celestial Path—if they really wanted to, they could, but they would have to cripple themselves, and cultivate from the beginning, yet there were Celestial Kings within the Celestial Path. Then, the Celestial Kings here would be comparable to Heavenly Venerates that were invincible.

Ling Han laughed. He dared to even point at Heavenly Venerates and insult them to their faces. How could it be that he would be scared by an Ascending Origin Tier? He walked forwards. “What I despise most is when someone threatens me!”

“This is not a threat!” the tall man stated calmly, his eyes menacing. HIs killing intent was indeed very strong.

He did not know Ling Han and the others, but who asked these people to be really too despicable? They actually walked over the rainbow bridge so quickly, causing him to lose.

He was displeased, and wanted to kill. As for those outside the Celestial Path? Apologies, he only considered them his prey.

Hu Niu was the first to jump out. “If you want to fight with Niu’s Ling Han, you have to first pass Niu!”

She was mostly just itching for a fight. There was no one that could match her in the Eastern Celestial Realm at all. As an elite, she felt very lonely.

The tall man couldn’t help but be stunned. Both Hu Niu and the Empress were too beautiful to look at, and he had held himself back from looking previously. But with Hu Niu stepping out like this, all his attention was involuntarily captivated as his heartbeat sped up.

“You still want to kill Niu’s Ling Han, you smelly bug!” Hu Niu made the first move.

Boom!

The moment she made her move, it was incredibly frightening. Her tiny fist shot out, but it was like the heaven and earth were collapsing.

The expressions of both tall and short man changed drastically. Though the short man had not had any killing intent, he had not taken Ling Han and his group seriously, either. It wasn’t right until this show from Hu Niu that they finally realized just how terrifying the opponent was.

No wonder they had managed to cross the rainbow bridge within three days. Without overwhelming talent and strength, how could they possibly accomplish this feat?

And this was because they had not witnessed the scene of Ling Han sprinting madly on the rainbow bridge, or they would defintiely be scared to death.

The tall man quickly moved to parry, but in front of Hu Niu, he was completely far from enough. Very soon, he was suppressed completely, and defeat was only something that would happen in an instant.

This was natural; Hu Niu was a Monarch Star!

“Ah!” The tall man roared in fury. He took out something red that looked a little like dirt, and then actually stuffed it into his mouth.

“Even if you’re no match for Niu, there is no need to eat dirt, right?” Hu Niu laughed loudly.

The tall man did not reply, but his battle prowess actually soared many times over in an instant, with multiple veins popping out all over his body, making it seem like he had turned into some kind of monster, which was extremely frightening.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. Even if this tall man flipped out suddenly in this state, he actually would still be no match for Hu Niu, yet he now had the ability to fight back.

But it should be known that Hu Niu was a Monarch Star. This person was a king tier, at most. What the heck was that red thing to actually be able to help a king tier instantly realize a double leap in strength?

From king tier to Monarch Star, the increase to battle prowess was astonishing.

“Humph, Niu will still beat you until you burst!” Hu Niu shouted, her tiny fists shooting out in a barrage of punches. True enough, the tall man was suppressed in only about 100 moves. Even if they were both Monarch Stars, there were still differences in strength, and the present Hu Niu belonged to the category of extremely powerful Monarch Star.

Hu Niu’s foot stomped on the tall man. He struggled, wanting to get up, but he felt like there was an immovable colossal mountain weighing down on him. He couldn’t move the slightest bit.

“Hehe, we can talk things over,” the short man hurriedly played mediator. He, too, had gotten a scare. He had not expected that Ling Han and his group would have such terrifying strength. Even when his companion had used the ultimate means, he was still unable to win.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “That bright red thing, you have it too, right?”

The short man hesitated slightly, and sure enough, he took a bright red object from his robes. It really looked like mud, but it was very sticky and smooth, filled with bounciness. There was completely no way to discern what this was.

Ling Han took it over, and studied it closely, but could not sense anything at all.

He thought for a while, and then bit into it.

The short man couldn’t help but be dumbfounded, wondering if this person was an actual idiot. He didn’t even know what this exactly was, and actually dared to bite into it? What if this was a deadly poisonous substance?

Ling Han naturally dared to eat it because he had very strong confidence.

Firstly, the tall man had eaten it too, and secondly, Ling Han’s physique was incredibly amazing. He was just that tiny sliver away from the Celestial King Tier, and could completely be considered a Celestial King himself. Thus, he was naturally unafraid.

He was too curious. To be able to cause a king tier’s strength to spike so madly, this was no ordinary object. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. His body was actually absorbing that unique power of this heaven and earth!

F*ck, this thing was too shocking, wasn’t it?

‘Wait, no!’

Ling Han immediately shook his head. Though his body absorbed this kind of power, it could not truly absorb it. His body could only be considered a passage, and in this process, there was not the slightest improvement to his physique.

If anyone wanted to use this to comprehend the first step towards Heavenly Venerable Tier, this would be completely impossible.

Even so, this was too amazing.

A bright red thing could allow one to lend the power of heaven and earth!

No wonder the tall man’s strength had suddenly soared so greatly. Just like Ling Han, who was clearly only at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, his battle prowess had directly soared to the First Heaven Celestial King Tier, but it was not so exaggerated for him.

Furthermore, this thing would be useless outside of the Celestial Path. Thus, it was only here that the power of heaven and earth would be so close, but once you were outside, it would be far from reach.

What made Ling Han even gloomier was that he could not obtain the slightest improvement to his battle prowess, and the ultimate reason was probably because he had already used the Void Particle Energy which was even higher in level to temper his body, so the red demonic dirt had no effect of boosting his battle prowess.

Hu Niu was keen. The more Ling Han forbade her, the more she thought about it.

Because it was the tall man who had shown killing intent first, Ling Han had no plans to stop her, either, but instead told Hu Niu to have fun playing. Once she was bored with it, she would not keep ***** at the tip of her tongue in future.

The little girl took out an iron spear, a malicious expression curling up the corners of her lips. Then, all of a sudden, she stabbed it into the behind of that tall man.

“Ah!” The tall man released an agonized wail. He could be no more tragic than this.

Ling Han ignored him, and merely patted the short man’s shoulder. “Oh, right, I forgot to ask who you guys are.”

The short man wanted to cry. ‘You guys are too cruel, aren’t you? You don’t even know who we are, and you’ve beaten up my colleague, and have even him. It hurts even just by looking.’

“W-we are the subordinates of the Blue North King.”

Ling Han smiled. “Come, tell me all about this Blue North King.”

In the Celestial King, it was natural that every Celestial King would be called a king.

Because of various reasons, there were many people who had not managed to leave the Celestial Path in time, and as a result, they were trapped here for eternity. Furthermore, there were some that were outstandingly talented among them as well. The majority of them were emperor tiers. After going through an extensive period of time, there naturally was a chance for them to become Celestial Kings as well.

Additionally, those that were trapped would also have children here, and as generations passed, some outstandingly talented descendants would emerge from their line, and become Celestial Kings as well.

The Blue North King belonged to the latter category.

He was a native that was born and raised on the Celestial Path, while his parents were both disciples that had come from great sects. However, they had not managed to become Celestial Kings ultimately. Instead, it was he that possessed the aptitude of an emperor tier, and after countless years of hard cultivation, he had reached the pinnacle of his life.

The Blue North King ruled over the crucial point where the rainbow bridge entered into the Celestial Path. If one wanted to barge into the expansive space of the Celestial Path, they would first have to pass through the territory of the Blue North King.

Ling Han asked further about the power structure in the Celestial Path, and finally gained further knowledge of this place.

Inside the Celestial Path, even the Celestial King with the highest cultivation level was only at Third Heaven. It could not be helped. It was practically impossible that there would be monarch tiers among those that would remain here, so it was naturally difficult to attain Fourth Heaven or Fifth Heaven.
