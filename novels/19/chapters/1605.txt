Chapter 1606: Suffering the consequences of his actions

“B*tch, you have indeed appeared!” Cai Miao said sinisterly. He no longer had any dreams about Empress Luan Xing.

He indeed still wanted to possess the Empress, but did not want to do so through courting her. Instead, he wanted to take her through brute force.

He now had such strength!

“Kneel!” He made his move, incredibly dark thoughts filling his heart. He wanted to have the Empress kneel in front of him, and lick his toes.

The Empress did not even bother to speak, and merely directed a slap at Cai Miao.

Pa!

But this time, Cai Miao was not struck. Instead, he managed to stretch out his arm to parry the blow in the nick of time, and stopped this palm strike in its course.

“Haha, I am no longer the person I once was!” Cai Miao laughed loudly. This feeling of strength was really too awesome. With a turn of his hand, he stretched out his hand to grab at the Empress’s wrist. Even just a touch of her wrist would satisfy a little of his desire to take advantage of her.

Seeing this scene, not just the disciples were furious, even the Saints of the Hu Clan couldn’t help but frown—a mere ant like him still dared to touch a woman that they had their eyes on?

The Empress naturally would not allow him to succeed. Her fingers swept out, and delivered a frightening Sword Qi.

Peng, peng, peng. The two of them endlessly exchanged blows at close range, but their respective abilities were unexpectedly equal. Neither was able to get the upper hand.

“I can be even stronger!” Cai Miao shouted loudly. He took a deep breath and exhaled. True enough, the power within him was bubbling. Every star expanded again, reaching an extreme size.

They could not grow any bigger. Even just the slightest bit bigger would mean that they would explode.

“I am an invincible king tier!” Cai Miao shot out a punch at the Empress. The killing formation activated, but compared with his own battle prowess, the might of the killing formation was actually negligible.

Ling Han watched from outside, and internally assessed, ‘About the standard of over 2,000,000 stars.’

In a Forbidden Land, there was no small number of such prodigies, but they had all reached that level through their own cultivation. Cai Miao, on the other hand, would only be short-lived.

Ling Han could see very clearly that this kind of strength was obtained through paying the price of burning one’s own life. After the battle ended, even if Cai Miao did not die, he would become a cripple. At most, he would live until reaching the 100 years’ limit of a mortal lifespan before dying of old age.

This kind of strength... The Empress could handle it.

The Empress’s face was filled with pride. She used a celestial technique, and the Darkness of the Paramount Night spread out. As an endless darkness enshrouded Cai Miao, he had absolutely no idea where the target of his attack was even though he possessed extremely strong power.

“Not enough! Not enough!” Yet Cai Miao shouted loudly, and struck out with both hands, creating a strong gale that dispersed the darkness by force.

In front of absolute strength, indeed, nothing could stand in his way.

The Empress was not discouraged, and through the movements of her hands, she used the Flying Dragon Shadow Hands. Pa, pa, pa, pa. One after another, palm strikes landed on Cai Miao. The speed was much too fast, and Cai Miao was unable to dodge at all.

Cai Miao stumbled from the attacks, but what was stunning was the fact that his present defenses were also extremely shocking. His expression didn’t even change after sustaining so many palm strikes, as if he had become completely immortal.

Because this was the ultimate glory that came from completely forcing out all of one’s potential and vitality, Cai Miao’s present recovery ability was comparable to having cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Though the punch caused him serious injury, he had completely recovered in the next instant.

After a dozen over steps, Cai Miao finally regained his footing. Through a moment of sensing, he realized that he did not have the slightest bit of injury. Then, he couldn’t help but laugh raucously. This was strength that had reached a level that even he himself could barely believe it.

As expected of the ways of a Saint King, it was nature-defying!

“It’s my turn!” He leaped back, and began his counterattack.

However, it was only his power that had been boosted, and he did not cultivate any celestial technique, so the power of his attacks was actually very limited. How could he possibly defeat the Empress?

The two of them fought fiercely. One showed endless numbers of celestial techniques, while the other’s recovery ability was nature-defying, and he could recover immediately no matter how powerful the attacks he sustained, which resulted in a stalemate.

The Empress couldn’t help but be angered. With a thought, she finally used her bloodline ability, or rather the ability of the Nine Deaths Heaven Art. One after another, doppelgangers walked out from her body, and there were suddenly 10 Empresses standing quietly in the arena.

“The art of doppelgangers?” Cai Miao was unafraid. How could mere copies match the original? They naturally were mainly meant for confusion, and their battle prowess could be ignored completely.

The Empress moved. Boom, 10 bodies moved at the same time, each using a different celestial technique.

Even Ling Han was dumbfounded at this sight.

Darkness of the Paramount Night, Flying Dragon Shadow Hands, Tide of the Ages, Lightning Sword Technique... Each doppelganger was independently using a different celestial technique, and they directed their attacks at Cai Miao.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Cai Miao was attacked fiercely. His recovery ability was indeed amazing, but he could not hold up to the simultaneous attacks of celestial techniques from 10 Empresses. Very soon, he was spurting out blood from his mouth. Then, his whole body was spraying out blood. It could be clearly seen that Cai Miao’s body was completely misshapen as multiple bones pierced out of his skin.

“I am... invincible!” Cai Miao roared out angrily. He wanted to pull himself together and make a comeback, yet suddenly paled in shock. His power was abruptly beginning to decline, and at a very rapid pace. In an instant, his power had fallen to rock bottom.

He was far from his original state, what more being invincible in the whole world.

He had aged in an instant, his skin becoming loose, his hair turning gray, and his face was covered with wrinkles. In a single instant, he had become an old man that was close to his death.

“Er...” He struggled, wanting to get back to his feet, yet he did not even have the slightest bit of strength left. It was all wasted effort.

The Empress had forced him to his limits, and the battle had not yet ended, but his life essence was already no longer sufficient for him to continue burning it. Not only had he been beaten back to his original state, he had even become a mortal.

With a wave of the Empress’s hand, her nine doppelgangers returned to her body. She did not even look at Cai Miao, and directly walked back to sit beside Ling Han. She had withdrawn her aggressive bearing, and became a gentle little woman.

“Cough! Cough!” In the arena, Cai Miao was still throwing up blood. His cultivation level was completely gone, and with such heavy injuries, he was already close to death.

He looked in Hu Luo’s direction, and was still having his deluded dreams, anticipating that Hu Luo would step out and save him, but this naturally was only a mere delusion. The members of the Hu Clan only smirked coldly. They were only using Cai Miao like a lackey in the first place. How could they possibly care about the life of a dog?

Meanwhile, the Star Sand Saint nodded at the Tranquil Heart Saint, and the Tranquil Heart Saint understood his signal. He leaped out, and picked Cai Miao up. The saintly power inside him surged and temporarily suppressed Cai Miao’s injuries.

“This person... cannot die so easily!” he said.

All the disciples had thought that the Tranquil Heart Saint wanted to save Cai Miao, but when they heard this, they couldn’t help but nod. That was right. How could he be allowed such an easy death after betraying the academy?

‘Weren’t you very arrogant? Just continue being arrogant now then!’

Hu Luo was uncaring, and waved his hand, saying, “Continue.”

A member of the Hu Clan leaped out. He surveyed the masses, and finally fixed his eyes on Ling Han. He said, “I am Hu Yangchen, and would like to seek some guidance from Brother Ling.”

They were finally getting serious!

Ling Han smiled calmly, stood up, and replied, “Since you are in such a rush to die, how could I not oblige?”

Hu Yangchen couldn’t help but be greatly enraged. He was in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, and had further cultivated close to 3,000,000 stars.

‘You are only in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, so where did you get such confidence from?’

Wasn’t he afraid of being forced to eat his own words?

“Then let us have a battle!”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
