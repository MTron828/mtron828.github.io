Chapter 882: Boost of Fortune

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Is every dot a great land like the one before?”

“How is that possible? They are all circular, so wouldn’t the people who stood on the other side fall off?”

“Is the Immortal Realm so big? It is practically endless!”

Everyone was exclaiming in shock. They were used to their surroundings, and the lower realm was really just a piece of land, the skies circular and the land squarish. But here, the lands were circular, which had shattered their perception so far.

“What is that huge ball of fire? Is that the sun? But is the sun that big?”

“So those multiple stars turned out to be various lands, circular lands!”

The lower realm was really flying too quickly; they had possibly surpassed any great elite of the Immortal Realm, and had instantly passed by uncountable galaxies and innumerable universes. Finally, its speed slowed down.

Ahead of them, there appeared a gigantic planet. It was primarily covered with yellow earth, and the sky-blue ocean merely occupied a fifth of its entire expanse.

The lower realm descended. Part of the earth was ripping open as if it was making room for it.

One had to know that the lower realm was really quite big, but compared with this planet, it was pitifully small. They did not even reach ten-thousandth of its size.

It would be a piece of cake for this planet to accommodate the whole lower realm.

Hong , a muffled sound came from the earth—it was the mainland setting rigidly in place. An even denser Spiritual Qi surged forth, and instantly led to a considerable many completing their breakthrough. The level here was too high; even if they merely took a few breaths, it would be enough to let these “mortals” advance their cultivation level.

Ling Han was also feeling internally restless. He had already reached the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and was qualified to break through. However, he chose to suppress his breakthrough. It was slightly difficult to cultivate to the strength of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier in the Lower Realm, but this was the Immortal Realm, and there were explosively large amounts of resources of various kinds.

“Long live!”

“Long live the emperor!”

The whole mainland was cheering. Now, they had finally struggled free of the destiny of becoming raw materials, and had furthermore become the people of the Immortal Realm. Their level of existence had been greatly boosted, and in future, this boost would slowly be reflected.

Above the Imperial Capital, the totem of the Black Tower became solid, and was increasingly majestic. Innumerable streams of Spiritual Qi as well as some indescribable, unknown substance gushed into the totem of the Black Tower, and through this, transmitted into the body of the person who had engraved his name on the totem of the Black Tower.

Splitting open the sky was a great feat, and it would obtain the approval and reward from the heavens and earth.

Ling Han discovered that his strength was in the process of rapidly increasing.

Fourteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier, fifteen Stars, sixteen Stars!

However, two days’ time had also passed.

A strength upgrade of a whole three Stars was too frightening. This meant that his current battle prowess was close to reaching 30 Stars of Shattering Void Tier! Additionally, he discovered something had also changed with his physique. His Spirit Base moved, filled with godly traits.

The one who split the sky open would be boosted with fortune!

Something like fortune was indescribable, untouchable and invisible, but it would really unleash its usefulness.

The whole nation was celebrating. It was a day of great joy for all the citizens of the Great Ling Empire.

But this kind of wonderful atmosphere did not persist long. Very soon, an elite of this planet had arrived.

“Who is the nation’s leader?” An arrogant, disdainful voice sounded. A person was standing above the imperial palace.

He was... an Immortal!

Ling Han’s present battle prowess was close to 30 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, but from the first moment he saw the speaker, he knew that he could not possibly be a match for the latter.

The gap was too big.

Even the weakest kind of Immortal would be several thousand times stronger than the most monstrous Shattering Void Tier cultivator! Now, there was no realm barrier separating them anymore. Immortals were real Immortals, without the slightest decrease to their actual power.

Before splitting open the sky, Ling Han was already prepared. Thus, without a change of expression, he merely said calmly, “I am here!”

“Oh?” The person was a man that seemed to be in his thirties, with a tall and thin figure. He deliberately revealed his ability, and there was a shadowy image of a tall mountain behind him.

This meant that he was in the Mountain River Tier, but he had only reached the minor layers of Mountain River Tier at most. Because the tier was called Mountain River Tier, how could he be considered complete where there was only a mountain but no river? In the Immortal Realm, this was the lowest ranked elite, but they could still be called elites as they could crush all people of the lower realm.

“I am the special envoy of the Eastern Void Royal Empire, Yan Yongyi. Since you are the nation’s leader, then immediately deliver up your national book and declare yourself subject to my empire!” he said calmly, looking extremely indifferent.

In his eyes, it was a natural turn of events.

How many Immortals were there in the Eastern Void Royal Empire? They numbered in the millions! Any one of them would be able to destroy this new world, so wasn’t declaring themselves subject to their authority a natural turn of events?

Hearing these words, all the citizens in the imperial capital looked angered.

After this feat of splitting open the sky, everyone now thought of Ling Han as a real god, an invincible emperor! How could an emperor suffer such humiliation?

“Hoho, even the Eastern Void Royal Empire would dare to vie for this new territory with my Content Water Royal Empire?” Xiu , another person appeared suddenly and quickly, standing above the imperial palace to stand opposite of Yan Yongyi. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha, have you all forgotten my Thunder Central Royal Empire?” A third Immortal arrived.

Ling Han had heard Yi Shuang Shuang say before that land and citizens were all extremely valuable resources in the Immortal Realm because they would have an effect on power of the nation. Now that a new mainland had come from a small world, what force would not want to have a share of the loot?

More importantly, splitting open the sky would be rewarded by the heavens and earth, and if one could swallow up the power of the nation of the Great Ling Empire, it would be extremely nutritious for the nation and their own power of the nation.

Ling Han stood solemnly and silently. He had long made himself prepared, yet could also control the price, and “sell” for a good price—he at least wanted to sell themselves off to a relatively powerful force. Then, after he left, the Great Ling Empire would be relatively safe, and there was no need to worry about it being invaded.

Xiu , amidst the flicker of brilliant light, an air vessel arrived, traveling through the air.

Abruptly, those three Immortals showed expressions of utmost seriousness.

The Immortal Realm had the rules of the Immortal Realm. Those that could fly with only their physical bodies were definitely great elites, but possessing a God Tool that allowed flight also implied a formidable background. Putting aside all others, those Immortals that had arrived first had all raced over on their own two legs. They had only arrived first because they were nearer.

On board of this air vessel, there stood a man dressed in white robes that fluttered in the breeze. Appearance-wise, he looked to be only twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, but those who were able to become Immortals had extraordinarily long lifespans, so their age naturally could not be judged by appearance.

There was a treasured sword slung on his back. He did not show his aura, and there was no way to estimate his cultivation level just from his appearance.

“Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire!” When everyone saw a symbol emblazoned on the air vessel, they were immediately filled with apprehension, and revealed their respect.

Just like in the Lower Realm, where the names of sect, faction, and society could not be used arbitrarily, it was the same in the Immortal Realm. Imperial Empire, Majestic Empire, and Royal Empire all represented absolutely different levels of power.

With an overseer of the Sun Moon Tier, a faction could establish a nation in the Immortal Realm and set up a Royal Empire. Meanwhile, a Majestic Empire required an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, whereas Imperial Empire needed an elite of the Eternal River Tier. This could absolutely not be messed up. Of course, an existence like the Great Ling Empire was naturally going by a different standard because it had risen from the lower realm.

“Are you the nation’s leader?” The white-robed man looked at Ling Han, smiled, and said, “I am Shang Chengyun, and am under the authority of the Lord Left Minister of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.”

“Lord Shang.” Ling Han clasped his hands in greeting. This was the Immortal Realm; there was a need for him to put away all his pride. However, it was an easy thing to put away his pride, but difficult to bend his proud personality. In his bones, he was still a very forceful person, and possessed a pride that preferred death to dishonor.
