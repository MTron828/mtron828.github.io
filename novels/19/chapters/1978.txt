Chapter 1979: Killing the Chicken to Warn the Monkeys

Ling Han truly wasn’t deprecating them. Rather, without learning the true meaning of the Regulation of Slaughter, it was genuinely impossible for these people to learn the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords. They would merely be wasting their time.

This had nothing to do with talent. Of course, this was unless one possessed heaven-defying talent.

“You...!” The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven were enraged upon hearing this. Not only had Ling Han destroyed the stone tablet and prevented them from learning the sword technique, but he was even calling them trash!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “What? You’re not resigned to this? Then come, see how I pummel you people.”

The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven faltered upon hearing this. They then looked toward Shu Yarong.

Of everyone present, only Shu Yarong could rival Ling Han.

However, Shu Yarong remained silent. After all, Ji Wuming had already said that he would personally take Ling Han’s life. Thus, let alone targeting Ling Han, she might even help him if he were facing a life-threatening situation.

A wide grin spread across Ling Han’s face. He wouldn’t be afraid even if Shu Yarong truly targeted him. During their battle with Ji Wuming, he had already observed her battle prowess clearly. At most, she was only as powerful as him. Of course, this was ignoring any trump cards that she might have.

He swept his gaze over Ma Lugang and the others, and said, “As men, it’s best for you not to rely on a woman. If you have balls, then come at me.”

Ma Lugang jumped forward, and said, “Do you really think you’re invincible?”

He knew that he was no match for Ling Han. However, exchanging 10 or 100 blows with him shouldn’t be any problem at all. Thus, he decided to exchange a few blows with Ling Han. After winning some face back, he would then retreat and leave. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Han immediately shot forward.

Whoosh!

Like a bolt of lightning, he instantly appeared before Ma Lugang. He then reached over to grab at his face.

“Impudence!” Ma Lugang roared. He replied with a palm strike of his own.

‘You’re indeed stronger than me. However, you still can’t underestimate me like this!’

A smile of ridicule tugged at the corners of Ling Han’s lips. Drawing on the power of the Black Tower, he immediately activated the power of time. Ma Lugang’s movements instantly slowed down.

Time was flowing at a slower pace.

With Ling Han’s current power, he simply needed to decrease Ma Lugang’s speed by a limited amount. Reaching over, he easily grabbed onto Ma Lugang’s face and directly lifted him up. He faced no resistance at all.

‘F*ck!’

A cold chill ran down the spines of the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven. Ma Lugang was the eighth-ranked monarch tier of the Wide Prosperity Heaven! Even though he was no match for the top three freaks, was ranking inside the top 10 not freakish enough already?

Yet, he couldn’t even withstand a single strike from Ling Han!

Had Ling Han been this powerful before?

Ling Han was naturally using this opportunity to assert his might and dominance. Otherwise, it would be beneath him to draw on the power of the Black Tower to target a “weakling”.

“Mmph...” Ma Lugang started to thrash about, yet this was in absolute vain. His face was filled with fury and embarrassment. As a mighty monarch tier, he had actually been captured in a single exchange! This made him look like a complete fool for what he had said before.

This was utterly humiliating.

“If you’re so weak, then obediently stand aside. Don’t charge into your own death!” Ling Han said in a baleful voice. He was radiating with ice-cold killing intent.

“Ling Han, release him!” Shu Yarong chided. She wouldn’t attack Ling Han, but this didn’t mean that she would remain indifferent to him killing prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

Ling Han glanced at her, and said in a calm voice, “Do I know you?”

“Don’t test my patience!” Shu Yarong replied with an ice-cold expression.

Crack!

With a tightening of his grip, Ling Han instantly snapped Ma Lugang’s neck. Ma Lugang shuddered for a moment before falling completely limp.

So what if he was a monarch tier? He only had one life.

“You...!!” Shu Yarong was wild with rage.

Boom!

Her silky black hair started to billow even though there was no wind. She was burning with flames of fury.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back, and said, “You what? Do I owe you anything? Don’t command me to do this and that. I can do whatever I want!”

Shu Yarong clenched her hands into fists. If she’d still possessed the power of Celestial Kings, she would have instantly captured Ling Han. At that time, she would have complete authority over his life. Now, however, there was nothing she could do.

“Leave!” She gritted her teeth and growled. The stone tablet had already been destroyed, so there was no point staying on this second mountain peak any longer.

A feeling of grief and sorrow welled up in the hearts of the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven. As they looked at Ling Han taking the Spatial God Tools from Ma Lugang’s body, they were completely powerless to stop him. They could only turn around and leave.

Boom!

A ball of Nine Heavens Flame burst forth from Ling Han’s hands, incinerating Ma Lugang’s corpse. With Ma Lugang’s death, the animosity between them also vanished. Thus, Ling Han would allow him to peacefully return to the embrace of heaven and earth.

Hu Niu leaped onto Ling Han, and said, “Bad Ling Han! Niu was only a step away from mastering the eighth technique.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “No worries. I’ll teach you guys in the future.”

The stone tablet had indeed disappeared. However, he had already obtained the full inheritance of the eight sword techniques. After reaching a certain height, perhaps he could even create the ninth technique by himself.

‘I definitely can,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He had obtained the true meaning of the Regulation of Slaughter, and he had also learned the first eight techniques of the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords. Thus, as long as he completely mastered these, creating the ninth sword technique would only be a matter of time.

“Brother Ling, I’m also relying on you,” Yan Xianlu said shamelessly.

The Heaven Destroying Nine Swords was incredibly powerful. After all, this was a technique that was built on the foundation of the Regulation of Slaughter. Before reaching the level of Celestial King, this technique was even stronger than those of the five elements and the Regulation of Lightning.

Ling Han chuckled in reply. He didn’t agree or disagree.

If he had time, he wouldn’t mind teaching Yan Xianlu. However, he was an extremely busy person, so it was impossible for him to remain in a single place for an extended amount of time. Thus, he didn’t dare to make any promises.

Fortunately, Yan Xianlu was only saying this in passing. Each person had their own opportunities and destiny, so this wasn’t something that could be obtained by force.

They started to descend the mountain.

Ascending the mountain had been extremely difficult, yet descending it was as easy as could be. They could all remember the path that they had taken to get here, so descending was naturally a piece of cake.

They headed toward the third mountain peak.

To their astonishment, the third peak was incredibly easy to ascend. There was no powerful gravitational force, nor was there any maze to navigate. There was no monster to block their path, either. Thus, it only took them seven days to reach the peak of this mountain.

In reality, however, they hadn’t reached the true peak of the mountain. This was because the mountain peak was cut off midway. Even so, it was still unbelievably tall.

In any case, it was no wonder that there hadn’t been any obstructions or difficulties. As it turned out, this mountain peak had already been annihilated.

“It was most likely damaged during the battle between the Celestial Kings.”

“How astonishing. I truly wonder how astounding that battle was.”

“I truly want to witness a battle between Celestial Kings.”

They all sighed with emotion before turning around to leave.

Right now, there was only a single thing left for them to find—the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, a Source Power of heaven and earth.

However, this valley was so incredibly large, so how would they find it?

“Then... let’s just casually stroll around,” Ling Han said.

The Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou naturally wouldn’t oppose this. Meanwhile, Yan Xianlu decided to split paths with them. First of all, he didn’t want to interrupt Ling Han and his “family”. Second of all, they were looking for the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, and this was completely up to each person’s luck. This wasn’t determined by strength.

“One of the annoying people has finally left! However, the other one is still here!” Hu Niu said as she looked at Bewitching Maiden Rou.

However, Bewitching Maiden Rou was extremely thick-skinned, and she didn’t pay any heed to this. This caused Hu Niu’s eyes to glint with anger again.

The four of them started to casually stroll around. In this colossal valley, they truly didn’t know where to go.

Perhaps they might have to wait here for several hundred years, or even several thousand years.

Fortunately, the Three Blooms Valley had no limit on how long they could remain. There was no rule that they had to leave after a certain number of years, or risk facing a fatal punishment. This allowed them to stroll around at a leisurely pace.

However, for a Source Power of heaven and earth, this was completely worth it.

The valley was crawling with monsters that were filled with spikes. However, to Ling Han and the others, these monsters weren’t an annoyance. Instead, they were a source of treasures. They possessed Celestial King Bloodstones that contained the Regulation of Slaughter, and these were treasures that were as valuable as a city.

In the blink of an eye, seven years had already passed. Ling Han and the others hadn’t wasted this time, and they had instead used it to strengthen their grasp of the Regulation of Slaughter and the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords.

Crack!

A bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky, giving Ling Han and the others a fright.
