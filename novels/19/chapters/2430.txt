Chapter 2431: Yu Wudi

After each taking their own path, the journeys of the cultivators from the Eastern and Western Celestial Realm all converged here.

This place was called Splendor City, and it was guarded by an experienced Celestial King who had the title of Splendor. He was at the First Heaven, though it was unknown whether he was accompanied by another Celestial King called?Wealth1.

Ling Han kept a low profile. He was sure that Ji Wuming, Jia Lan, and the other monarch stars had already obtained low-level Celestial Seeds, allowing them to cultivate to the Pseudo-Celestial King Tier. In other words, their strength could now rival that of the Empress and Hu Niu. If they further ingested the Crimson Demonic Earth, they could essentially be regarded as Celestial Kings already. He couldn’t underestimate them.

If he wanted to compete with them, he had to be ruthless, accurate, and swift.

The four of them started to move quicker as they asked for information around the city. They discovered that there was indeed a Celestial Tree near the city. Moreover, the fruits of this tree were already nearing ripeness. However, the Splendor Celestial King had a son who wasn’t very successful. After huge efforts, he had only just reached the peak stage of the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier. His father cared for his son greatly, so he was intent on obtaining a complete Celestial Seed for him no matter what.

Disregarding whether one could obtain Celestial Fruits for someone else or not, if others wanted to fight for the Celestial Fruits, they would have to go through the Splendor Celestial King first.

Ling Han and the others were all brimming with confidence. Even though their Vitality Indices were all a little shy of the Celestial King Tier, they were four people in total, so just how powerful would their combined strength be? Moreover, Ling Han also possessed a deadly weapon in the Divine Demon Sword.

After learning of the Celestial Tree’s location, they started to head toward it.

In any case, the Splendor Celestial King wasn’t shockingly domineering, so he still allowed others to cultivate in the vicinity of the Celestial Tree such that they could absorb some of the fragrance of the Celestial Fruit.

After several hours, Ling Han and the others arrived on the bank of a lake that was situated in a plain. The lake wasn’t large, and it was only 300 meters in diameter. There was a white lotus in the center of the lake, and around three meters of it sat above the water. Instead of calling it a lotus, it was much more apt to call it a tree.

The white lotus had bloomed long ago, so it had already produced a seedpod that was as brilliant green as jade. However, it had only produced a single lotus seed, the sharp head of which looked like flowing gold. It radiated with a blinding glow. At a rough glance, this lotus seed was around one foot long. In fact, one could view it as a cob of corn.

The banks of the lake were dotted with people, all of whom were absorbing the fragrance of the lotus seed. They would use this fragrance to condense a Celestial Seed within their bodies.

However, where was the Splendor Celestial King?

Ling Han glanced around, but he didn’t find what he was looking for. Celestial Kings were extremely unique, so they would stick out like a dazzling star no matter where they stood. He would have been able to locate him in a single glance.

Right at this moment…

Whoosh!

A streak of black tore through the sky before coming to a halt above the lake, transforming into the figure of a middle-aged man. He was tall and slender, and dressed in a flowing gray robe, he radiated a profoundly powerful aura. Most importantly, a ring of fantastic iridescent light pulsated around him, making it seem as if he were one with heaven and earth. It was as if he were the heavens, and the heavens were him.

His existence was such that no one dared to even fathom standing up against him. After all, how could one rival heaven and earth?

He was none other than the Splendor Celestial King!

Ling Han’s pupils contracted. This Splendor Celestial King was even more powerful than the Blue North Celestial King. In fact, he was even more powerful than the six Celestial Kings that Blue North Celestial King had called over combined.

This person had reached the pinnacle of the First Heaven. His next step was to evolve with the help of a Celestial Fruit to advance to the Second Heaven.

There were Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and each step forward was like ascending the heavens.

Whoosh!

Another person descended. This was a wild-looking youth whose raven black hair billowed with the wind. There was blood in the corners of his eyes, yet he paid absolutely no heed to this. He roared with laughter as he said, “Lord Celestial King, your strength is indeed extraordinary. How admirable!”

Upon hearing this, commotion immediately rippled through the crowd of people around the lake.

This person spoke with such arrogance!

Even though he referred to the Splendor Celestial King as lord, his words didn’t carry any semblance of respect at all. It was as if the two of them were on equal standing.

However, one had to realize that this youth was only at the Ascending Origin Tier!

Ling Han was slightly astonished. It was clear that this youth had challenged the Splendor Celestial King just then. Moreover, the youth had definitely lost, though he had only suffered some minor injuries. This was proof enough of his extraordinary strength.

When did such a person appear in the Celestial Realm?

“You’re indeed extraordinary!” the Splendor Celestial King said in a solemn voice.

“Lord Celestial King, heaven and earth possess their regulations—it’s simply impossible for you to obtain this Celestial Seed. Why stubbornly insist on challenging heaven and earth? The path of Celestial Kings is to abide by the commands of the heavens. One musn’t rival the will of the heavens,” the youth said.

Everyone was astonished. These words wouldn’t have sounded out of place if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had uttered them. However, coming from a measly Ascending Origin Tier elite? How arrogant was he to speak like this? Perhaps he believed that he had the right to school Celestial Kings? Just who in the world did he think he was?

However, the Splendor Celestial King wasn’t enraged. Instead, he nodded, and said, “The strength of your esteemed father rivals that of heaven and earth. I gather that this is his comprehension?”

“Indeed,” the youth replied with a smile.

The Splendor Celestial King fell silent for a brief moment before saying, “Fine. I’ll treat this as an act of goodwill and leave this Celestial Seed to you. When you meet your esteemed father, please greet him for me.”

“Definitely,” the youth said with a beaming smile as he bowed in respect.

The Splendor Celestial King flicked his sleeves before tearing through space and instantly disappearing from above the lake.

Gasp!

Upon seeing this, everyone felt numb with shock. Who could have imagined this? This youth had actually convinced the Splendor Celestial King to give up on the Celestial Seed?

With just a few words?

No, no, no… How could a few words have achieved this? On the one hand, the youth was indeed very powerful. He had fought against the Splendor Celestial King just then, and his ability to make it out alive was already proof enough of his strength. On the other hand, his background was definitely also shocking. It was because of this that the Splendor Celestial King had been willing to yield. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just who in the world was this youth?

“I’ve heard from others that there’s a freak among the outsiders. Not long ago, he even defeated the Blue North Celestial King! I didn’t believe this before, but now… I believe it!”

“If I recall correctly, this freak is called Ling something…”

“Ling Han!”

“Yes, yes, yes, that’s right! That’s his name!”

“This person is Ling Han?”

Everyone was engaged in spirited discussions. However, they had misrecognized this youth as Ling Han.

The youth could naturally hear this, and his expression immediately fell dark. “My name is Yu?Wudi1! I’m not some random trash called Ling Han!”

‘What?! He’s not Ling Han?!’

Commotion rippled through the crowd again. In other words, there was more than one freak in the Celestial Realm this time?

A baleful expression spread across the Empress’ face. This person actually dared to speak about her man like this?

She strode forward, unleashing her profound aura that made her appear like a paramount goddess who peered down at the mere mortals.

Peng, peng, peng!

Her raging aura instantly slammed into the people around her, sending them flying. So what if they were at the pinnacle of the Ascending Origin Tier? Before a mighty Pseudo-Celestial King, they were nothing but trash.

Everyone was stunned to the core. Who in the world was this woman? She was as beautiful as a Celestial Maiden, and she was as mighty as a domineering emperor. Moreover, her strength was so overwhelming that it made them quake in fear!

Yu Wudi frowned upon seeing this. However, his brows quickly relaxed, and he said, “Who would’ve thought! In such a short amount of time, someone has already cultivated to the Pseudo-Celestial King Tier! You’re just like me, aren’t you? You’re unwilling to ascend using an inferior Celestial Seed, so you want to obtain a more perfect Celestial Seed. Haha! I like you!”

The Empress humphed coldly as she lashed out with her right hand.

Boom!

It was as if heaven were collapsing and earth were crumbling; it was as if the sun were dying and the moon were extinguishing. At this moment, her fury was unstoppable.

This person actually dared to slander her man?! He deserved death!

Whoosh!

Another figure dashed forward, throwing a punch at Yu Wudi.

This was none other than Hu Niu.

In her eyes, there was no such thing as rules and regulations. What one-on-one? Did this have anything to do with her? Niu’s Ling Han couldn’t be humiliated by others!

The two women unleashed their profound might, attacking Yu Wudi in unison.

They rarely teamed up, but after being around each other for so long, they had naturally developed some tacit understanding. Thus, their combined strength was unexpectedly powerful.
