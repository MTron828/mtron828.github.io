Chapter 288: Bet

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Cheng Fei Jun was only at the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier. Normally, he would at most be able to refine a medium level Black Grade medicinal pill, but since he could actually become a high level Black Grade alchemist, it meant that he definitely fused with a wisp of Strange Fire, achieving the breakthrough.

Although Ling Han had a ball of Strange Fire, he wouldn’t mind letting this wisp of Strange Fire make it even more powerful.

Cheng Fei Jun’s gaze was gloomy, and his expression revealed that he was moved.

Ling Han guessed that he possessed the Strange Fire, so Cheng Fei Jun could do it as well since Ling Han’s cultivation was even lower—only at the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier.

If Ling Han didn’t have this Strange Fire, then would he have the qualifications to be called a high level Black Grade alchemist? When the time came, he only needed to request a reexamination; if Ling Han couldn’t refine a high level Black Grade medicinal pill, then he naturally would be stripped of the respective alchemist level.

If Ling Han’s alchemist level was inferior, he could think of ways to slowly kill Ling Han.

The hatred of killing his brother made it impossible for them to live under the same sky; Ling Han had to die.

“Okay, I’ll take the bet!” He clenched his teeth, there was no way he would believe that something like him kneeling down to pay respects would happen… there was only one possibility, and that was for Ling Han to advance to the Earth Grade.

The question was: was it possible?

“I’ll ask a few masters to be notaries,” Cheng Fei Jun said again, afraid that Ling Han would be dishonest after losing.

“Hahaha, I’m also afraid that you’ll be dishonest, go ask for them.” Ling Han laughed aloud.

Seeing Ling Han so sure, Cheng Fei Jun couldn’t help but be a little startled inside—could this guy actually advance into the Earth Grade? Impossible, definitely impossible, a seventeen year old Earth Grade alchemist… that was just dreaming.

Besides, the most important point was that the materials had to be personally prepared in qualifying for alchemists above the Black Grade, and just how precious were Earth Grade materials? He wouldn’t believe that Ling Han had prepared materials, because this was obviously a sudden incident.

So, even if Ling Han really had the ability to charge to become an Earth Grade alchemist, without the corresponding materials, what could he possibly do?

With that thought, Cheng Fei Jun recovered his confidence, hurriedly getting Qian Xing, the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, cultivator to request several Earth Grade alchemists take up the matter as notaries.

Originally, two Black Grade alchemists’ bet wouldn’t possibly startle Earth Grade alchemists, but both of them were too young and thus with endless prospects, almost certain to become Earth Grade alchemists.

Thus, the Earth Grade alchemists were happy to give them face and look on for fun in passing.

There were three Star Brilliance Palace Hall’s Earth Grade alchemists, but all were low level Earth Grade… medium and high level Earth Grade alchemists couldn’t possibly appear in such a small place like the Nine Nations of the Desolate North. In the entire north region, a single Heaven Grade alchemist couldn’t be found.

These three Earth Grade alchemists were Long Yong Zhang, Li Si Yuan, and Yun Xing Xian, and all were in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. “The youngest” one was sixty, but this was still an alchemy prodigy, because he completed the leap into Earth Grade in his fifties; it was very difficult.

Unfortunately, without crossing into the Flower Blossom Tier, his lifespan was limited, so there was probably no hope of him grinding to medium level in this lifetime.

“My respects, three masters!” Seeing these three appear, everyone bowed one after another, even Cheng Fei Jun was no exception.

In the alchemy world, if alchemists were at the same grade—Yellow Grade, Black Grade, Earth Grade, and Heaven Grade—then the lower level one only needed to pay respects by cupping his hands when meeting a higher level colleague of the same grade. However, if it were a Grade’s difference, then even a high level Black Grade alchemist needed to pay deepest respects when encountering a low level Earth Grade alchemist; this was the rudimentary etiquette.

Before breaking through to the Earth Grade, even one as arrogant and conceited as Cheng Fei Jun had to be most respectful in front of the the three great alchemists.

Only Ling Han didn’t move. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Upong seeing this, Cheng Fei Jun instantly snorted and said, “Ling Han, such nerve you have, daring not to pay respects after seeing the three great alchemists!”

The three alchemists were originally a little bit annoyed, thinking that Ling Han was too conceited and unbridled. Hearing Cheng Fei Jun’s words, they naturally were even more displeased with Ling Han; their expressions instantly turned gloomy.

Ling Han looked at Cheng Fei Jun in disdain and said, “Who the hell are you, what the hell does it have to do with you whether I pay my respects or not? Since you abide by the rules so well, good, you can pay respects for me too.”

He paused momentarily, and cupped his hands to pay obeisance to the three alchemists and said, “Three brothers alchemists, I want to take the test for the Earth Grade!”

One stone raised a thousand ripples!

Everyone knew that Ling Han wanted Cheng Fei Jun to kneel and the only way to win the bet was to become an Earth Grade alchemist. However, hearing with their own ears that a seventeen-year-old youngster wanted to become an Earth Grade alchemist made everyone’s scalps numb.

A true monster!

Zhe He Xin naturally was full of confidence. Ling Han refined a quasi-Earth Grade Foundation Building Pill while in the Element Gathering Tier, and now advanced into the Gushing Spring Tier—refining a true Earth Grade medicinal pill was definitely not something hard for him. After all, Ling Han refined the Foundation Building Pill with extreme ease at the time, and not only did he form a lot of them, their quality also reached thirteen stars!

This was doable only by Earth Grade alchemists, or even only medium level Earth Grade alchemists.

Naturally, Hu Niu was baring her teeth at the surrounding people, apparently enraged. These guys dared to look hostilely at Ling Han, too detestable!

The three Earth Grade alchemists were greatly shocked; a seventeen year old taking the test for an Earth Grade alchemist, hiss… they instantly felt like they aged.

They couldn’t not be impressed, already knowing how young Ling Han was, but witnessing it with their own eyes still made them amazed. This youngster hadn’t even lost his juvenility and his body wasn’t completely grown, yet he was already a high level Black Grade alchemist, one step away from crossing into the true line of Big Bosses of alchemy.

Who would’ve thought that this kid actually spoke shockingly of becoming an Earth Grade alchemist!

No wonder he paid respects like an equal—was it because he was sure he definitely would succeed?

However, taking the test for a high level alchemist was every alchemist’s basic right. No one could stop it, so the three alchemy masters looked at each other before Long Yong Zhang said, “Approved! But, you’ve prepared your own materials?

When taking the test as an Earth Grade alchemist, the materials definitely should be prepared personally; otherwise, when the furnace exploded, who would bear the losses?

“It’s prepared.” Ling Han smiled. Those were superfluous words; if it weren’t his own materials, then the refined pill had to be given to the Star Brilliance Palace Hall, and he would get a bit of compensation at most, which would definitely be a huge loss.

“Then head to the refining room.” Li Si Yuan nodded.

The three Earth Grade alchemists took the lead, and the others followed behind.

A smirk appeared at the corner of Cheng Fei Jun’s mouth; he didn’t believe Ling Han had prepared enough materials, and didn’t believe it even more that someone so young had the qualifications to become an Earth Grade alchemist. This was definitely Ling Han’s youthful vigor and aggressiveness, wanting to stake it all.

He, was, not, scared!

They soon arrived outside the pill refining room; it was different from normal ones, having transparent walls—however, when one walked in, one would be completely unable to see the situation outside, and wouldn’t have to worry about it affecting pill refinement.

This pill refining room’s construction cost was very high; first, it was used to test alchemists, allowing others to witness the process from outside, and second, it was for high level alchemists to perform and showcase pill refinement.

Ling Han walked into the pill refining room without hesitation.
