2937 Fighting Side by Side

Thank you readers!

Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang appeared in time, and intercepted the three Sixth Tier monsters.

Ling Han was surprised. Xin Qihu would actually move to help him?

This guy was intent on killing Ling Han, and it was already very kind of him not to take advantage of the opportunity to hit him when he was down, but to actually help?

‘Has the sun risen from the west?’

But Xin Qihu had indeed joined forces with Wu Haoyang, and was battling extremely intensely with the three great Sixth Tier monsters. That was definitely not an act.

Ling Han could only say that in terms of the big picture, prodigies were impeccable, just like Xiao Yingxiong of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Faced with the surviving dregs of Hysteria’s troops, he unhesitatingly left the hope of survival to Ling Han.

Now that they were facing a great enemy, Xin Qihu did not think too much about it, and directly charged forward.

However though Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang were the greatest prodigies of all eternity, they were only at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, after all. Their battle prowess was close to the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, and they were actually no match for those three monsters in terms of power.

Thankfully, they all possessed first-grade seals, and Xin Qihu, for example, possessed a set of first-grade combination seals. Once they were channeled, his battle prowess would completely crush his opponent.

If this were the Realm Battlefield, then with Xin Qihu showing his might, his opponent would definitely be killed.

However, these three monsters had intelligence. They clearly knew that Xin Qihu’s power was already overwhelming, so how could they possibly face him head-on?

They separated, choosing not to exchange blows with Xin Qihu.

In just two hours, Xin Qihu’s boosted power would be reduced to its original state.

Xin Qihu naturally would not waste his own power for nothing. Since the enemy did not fight him head-on, he immediately stopped channeling the first-grade combination seals, and the battle instantly fell into a stalemate.

Ling Han let out a battle cry and charged back. He, too, had Sixth-Tier battle prowess after all, so he couldn’t just sit by and watch.

The three great prodigies teamed up against three peak-stage Sixth Tier monsters.

No matter how much Xin Qihu restrained himself from using the first-grade combination seals, once he used them, he would lose one more chance to use them. After battling for three days, the energy release of his set of first-grade combination seals had been completely depleted.

Instantly, the three monsters no longer had any reservations, and began a mad barrage of attacks.

Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang had each mastered a first-grade seal. This would surpass the second-grade seals that the three monsters used, but their original power was insufficient, and those could only compensate for the power gap between the two sides, and could not give them a crushing advantage.

The problem was that there were three monsters, and Ling Han was the weak link. His eighth-grade combination seals had already finished releasing energy, and though the ninth-grade combination seals could also increase his power by more than 200 times, it was still unable to close the gap in power between the two sides.

The three great prodigies fell into a dilemma, but since they could become the greatest prodigies of all eternity, which of them did not have a tenacious will?

So what if they were at a disadvantage, or even in a difficult situation? As long as there was a sliver of a chance, they would fight to the end.

The three of them joined forces. It was clear that there had been no previous cooperation, but in practically the blink of an eye, they had formed a tacit understanding. They cooperated with each other, producing an effect of one plus one that was greater than three.

On the other hand, the three Sixth Tier monsters didn’t have such excellent coordination. They all attacked on their own, their attacks random.

It looked like though Hysteria had bestowed intelligence on them, it had to have held something back. Otherwise, they were already Sixth Tiers, so how could they not know how to cooperate at all?

And it was precisely this that allowed the three great prodigies to hold up in the battle.

After battling for more than half a month, all their Heavenly Venerable Seals had been used up. They were clearly at an absolute disadvantage, yet defended extremely tenaciously. In fact, it could even be said that they were indomitable.

By the looks of it, they could still continue battling. Another month, or even one or two years wouldn’t be a problem.

“Hahaha!” The three great prodigies all laughed loudly. Though their bodies were covered with injuries, their fighting spirit was still incredibly high.

After battling for another three months, other elites finally arrived.

These were two Sixth Tier elites from the Flaming Frost Realm.

“Evil creatures, die!” The two great Heavenly Venerates immediately charged over. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They weren’t peak-stage Sixth Tiers, but they still had Sixth-Tier battle prowess, and they were also a fresh force. Instantly, the disadvantage of Ling Han’s side was reversed, but it was only a slight reversal. To say nothing of gaining an advantage, it couldn’t even be considered a draw.

However, another few days later, a second wave of Sixth Tier elites arrived.

In this manner, the two sides finally fought to a tie.

The three Hysteria’s creations communicated with their divine sense. “Let’s go!” They reached a consensus, and immediately retreated.

Xin Qihu and the others did not pursue. Firstly, they could not catch up, and secondly, so what if they did? Would they be able to win?

“The surviving dregs of Hysteria’s troops actually dare to chase us all the way here, what audacity!” a Sixth Tier elite said. He was a little curious, but also a little angry.

These Hysteria’s creations didn’t take them seriously at all?

“All of you, be careful. We will go and contact the other Sixth Tiers, and besiege these three evil creatures together,” another Sixth Tier said.

The Sixth Tier elites all left, and very soon only Ling Han, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang were left.

“It is truly fun to fight side by side with the two of you!” Wu Haoyang laughed loudly.

Ling Han also smiled. He glanced at Xin Qihu. After they had fought side by side, he had a more positive view of this guy now.

“Humph!” Yet Xin Qihu’s expression was cold. He met Ling Han’s gaze. “Don’t think that I will let you go just because you have fought side by side with me!”

“Same to you,” Ling Han said in reply. “Remember to clean your neck as well. Sooner or later, I’ll chop off your head!”

“Then I’ll kill you now!” Xin Qihu said balefully. “Initially, on the basis of the battle just now, I wanted to spare you, but you insist on seeking death.”

“Come on then!” Ling Han crooked a finger, not afraid in the slightest.

As a Sixth Tier[1] as well, even if he was outmatched, it did not mean that he could not put up a fight.

“I’ll oblige you!” Xin Qihu was just about to attack, yet he was stopped by Wu Haoyang.

With him there, there really wouldn’t be a fight.

“All right, all right, listen to me. Ling Han, you head west. Xin Qihu, you go east.” He became the mediator, which also caused his expression to become very strange. Someone like him only had battle in his eyes, and now he was actually stopping others from starting a battle, which was a little awkward.

“Humph!” Ling Han and Xin Qihu exchanged a glance before turning around to leave. One headed east, while the other headed west. It was as if they were determined to never see each other again.

“That’s right!”

Ling Han clapped his hands, and threw out Feng Wuding. After making him return to his original form, he first snatched away the Spatial Tool that Feng Wuding had on him, and then tossed him over to Wu Haoyang.

...

As Wu Haoyang and Xin Qihu watched, the corners of their mouths twitched slightly. Ling Han robbed Feng Wuding right in front of their eyes, and this was not the first time, either. ‘You keep bullying the same guy. Is that really good?’

Feng Wuding was also slowly waking up, and just happened to witness this scene. He couldn’t help but throw up blood in fury.

That was the accumulation of the World Alliance over innumerable years, and it had once again benefited Ling Han!

“Ling Han, you just wait! I will definitely kill you!” he shouted loudly, his face filled with despondence.

Since the heavens already gave birth to him, Feng Wuding, why did the heavens give birth to Ling Han?
