Chapter 1640: The Open Clouds King is executed

The Open Clouds King waved the three-pronged halberd, wanting to start his offensive, but his expression suddenly changed greatly. HIs hand shook, almost losing his grip on the God Tool.

He was already at the end of his rope, about to die!

With how severe his injuries were, it was completely impossible for him to rush back here, but his will to live was too frightening. He burnt his vitality, burnt his life force, and forcibly dragged himself to this state.

But his injuries would not disappear because of that. Contrarily, because he had burnt even his life force, how was he going to live on? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

His physical body was naturally indescribably worn out, and his spirit was also gradually aging, just like a worn candle in the wind that could be extinguished at any moment.

He was about to die!

The Open Clouds King was shocked. If he presently had not looked like a skeleton, his face would definitely have been pale.

No! No! No! No!

The Open Clouds King was a man who had an extreme fear of death. The strength of his longing for life surpassed any ordinary person’s, or he couldn’t possibly have raced back here. Even in such desperate straits, he had absolutely no intention of giving up.

The orbits that no longer had eyeballs swept over the people of the Forbidden Land, and a thought involuntarily flashed through his mind. A horrifying flame suddenly came to life in his eyeholes.

“Ancestor, go!”

“Long live ancestor, kill that guy!”

“Ancestor is invincible!”

All the members of the Zhong Clan shouted loudly, cheering on the Open Clouds King. In their eyes and hearts, the ancestor was a symbol of invincibility, and this place was also the Open Clouds Forbidden Land, where he would have the help of the formation and God Tool, so he would naturally be even more invincible.

Phew!

The Open Clouds King suddenly took a deep breath, which took the form of a hurricane.

This hurricane blew past, forming a powerful sucking force. All the members of the Zhong Clan were still cheering when they suddenly felt an agonizing pain that came from the tearing of their flesh. They shockingly realized that the blood and flesh was presently being removed from their bodies!

Why was it like this?

The sucking force of the hurricane was too strong, and the members of the Zhong Clan could not resist at all. Their blood and flesh were instantly removed from their skeletal frames, and wrapped up by the winds, fluttering in the air, actually forming a copper dragon!

Some clansmen had not advanced into the Immortal level, and their souls were incapable of fleeing their physical bodies. Suddenly, their skeletons collapsed onto the ground, instantly dead.

Those who had advanced into the Immortal level could still hold on, the power of their spirits forcibly stabilizing their skeletons. As long as their life force was undamaged, they could still regrow their flesh and blood. However, they immediately lost hope. The hurricane came back, and this time, it was targeting their spirits.

Resistance was not allowed at all. Hoo, everyone’s spirit was plucked, blown into the air by the hurricane. Even the few Saints were no exception. In front of a peak Saint King, who held a top grade Saint Tool and was controlling a supreme formation, all resistance was futile.

“Why?!”

“Ancestor, why?!”

These clansmen finally cried out with their spirits. They were resentful. Why did their ancestor make a move on them as if he had gone mad?

The Open Clouds King was unmoved. In the air, the blood and spirits of the members of the Zhong Clan blended together, forming a colossal copper dragon. Every member of the Zhong Clan had a certain amount of bloodline of the Time Dragon. With so much blood essence, and spirits interwoven together, it formed this unique scene.

He opened his mouth and sucked in a breath. Abruptly, this copper dragon flew towards him, and sank into his body. Suddenly, his body seemed like a barren land that had obtained nourishment, and immediately filled back out.

Blood and flesh visibly appeared on his skeleton-like body, but he completely did not recover to normal condition, and only seemed more human-like than before.

He had had no other choice. His blood essence and life force were all fully exhausted, and only the clansmen who had the same roots as he could save him. However, his cultivation level was too high, so even if he exterminated all the members of the whole clan, it only helped him recover a slight bit, and he could be considered to have been removed from the line of death.

“Die!” he roared, brandishing the three-pronged halberd in an offensive towards Ling Han. The copper dragon beneath his feat released a dragon cry, and blasted out the power of time.

He hated Ling Han. All this was because of this evil brat in front of him. Otherwise, how could he possibly have been forced to the extent that he had to swallow the blood essence and souls of his clansmen?

But he did not regret this at all. As long as he was still alive, he could reform the Zhong Clan, and their glory could return. On the other hand, if he was dead, then the Zhong Clan would really be finished.

“You are worse than a beast!” Ling Han’s expression was filled with an icy coldness. This man actually was so demented to make a move on his own clansmen; he practically could not be considered human!

Though he was on opposing sides of the Open Clouds King, he had never once thought of massacring the Open Clouds Forbidden Land as well. At most, he would only rob them of all their wealth and disband them. Yet the Open Clouds King, for the sake of his own survival, actually did not hesitate from making a move on his own descendants, devouring their blood, flesh, and spirits to continue his life. This made him despise the former incredibly.

“This is all your fault!” the Open Clouds King roared in fury, attacking endlessly.

Now that he had the help of a top-grade Saint Tool and the formation, his battle prowess should be stronger than before. However, what was unfortunate was that he himself was too weak. Though he had recovered slightly through swallowing his clansmen, that only drew him away from the line of death. He was far from his prime condition.

One was strong and the other was weak, and his battle prowess only stayed level with his previous condition.

What did Ling Han have to fear?

He used all his celestial techniques, his black locks dancing wildly, flames interwoven among his hair. That was because he was too furious. He could not help but want to slaughter this beast in front of him as painfully as possible.

The Open Clouds King tried his best to fight back, but his body was already too weakened. How could it possibly hold up to such a fierce battle? They only exchanged a few thousand blows, and his condition was already beginning to decline, and he fell once more into a state of hopelessness.

This time, there were no more clansmen left for him to swallow.

“Have a good trip on the path to hell. When you walk alongside your clansmen, let’s see what face you have left to see them!” Ling Han charged, his two swords striking madly. One sword sliced down on the Open Clouds King’s head, while the other stabbed at the Open Clouds King’s chest.

What ability did the Open Clouds King have left to resist him?

Pu, his head suddenly flew into the skies, and a sword pierced through his chest, coming out through his back.

No blood flowed, as he had long since turned his blood into battle prowess. How could there possibly be the slightest drop left?

The Open Clouds King was unconvinced. His spirit escaped his body, wanting to make the final struggle, but Ling Han added another sword strike. The murderous aura of the Divine Demon Sword engulfed him, and the Open Clouds King’s spirit was also sliced in two. That was an absolutely fatal strike.

The two halves of his spirit still wanted to join back together, releasing a shout that sounded like a wolf’s howl, yet no matter how hard he tried, he could not accomplish it.

“Why have you targeted me?” He released a roar of resentment. Previously, he had not been the only Saint King that had made a move on Ling Han, so why was Ling Han so determined to pursue and hunt him down? Furthermore, it had been a whole four years’ time. If this had been any other Saint King, he would probably have given up by now, wouldn’t he?

“This is only karma!” Ling Han uttered coldly. “I have gained the inheritance of the Heavenly River King, and have promised him to send you on your way!”

‘What?!’

The Open Clouds King’s spirit was astonished, suddenly stopping all struggle. So that was it!

He smiled tragically. This was really eating one’s own bitter fruit. All those years ago, he had betrayed the Heavenly River King, and in the blink of an eye, hundreds of millions of years had passed, and he had still met with the consequences of his own actions in the end.

“Hahahaha!” His spirit released a bout of mad laughter, yet was swiftly crumbling. Soon, it had turned to nothing, and had once again returned to the heaven and earth.

A Saint King of this generation had died!

With the death of the Open Clouds King, that three-pronged halberd immediately fell down from the skies, and the formation also stopped running, having lost its host.

Ling Han withdrew his Mystical Powers. His eyes swept over the area, and he involuntarily sighed softly.

The place below him was covered with corpses. There was clearly not the slightest smell of blood, yet it was exuding a strong feeling of misery.
