3052 Escape

Ling Han ran.

Hysteria naturally couldn’t just stand by and watch as he wreaked havoc. And after wreaking havoc, could he still leave? It immediately whipped out another tentacle.

Boom! The tentacle rose into the air with a terrifying might.

Ling Han ran as fast as he could. He was not going to fight Hysteria head-on; this was a task with no returns for him, and it would only cause him to fall into a tight encirclement. If he was struck by that Seventh-Tier fusion monster again, it would really be able to severely injure him.

Shua! The tentacle brushed past Ling Han’s back, and was just a little bit away from hitting his back.

“You’ve entered my territory, and you still want to run?” Hysteria sneered.

Boom! The ground in front of Ling Han immediately arched up, as if it had a life of its own, turning into a wall.

This was a dimension, and it was also Hysteria’s body. Naturally, it could change its body at will.

Boom! Ling Han directly crashed into it, and this wall immediately shattered, but Ling Han’s speed was also unavoidably affected.

Hysteria’s attack had already arrived, and was headed straight for Ling Han.

Ling Han turned around to face the attack. Hysteria’s attack was too terrifying. Even though his defense was powerful, he still had no choice but to parry it. Even if a single strike could not completely break through his defense, he still had to be on guard.

Under the huge impact, Ling Han only felt his arms go numb, and his entire body was sent flying.

Boom! Boom! Boom! The terrain here changed drastically. The ground began to wrinkle, and the path ahead had already disappeared, turning into hard mountain rock.

There was no way back now. He would either have to find another path, or he would have to fight his way through.

Ling Han decisively chose to advance courageously. Since Hysteria could change his path, it could naturally change any other part. In the first place, this was the inside of its body, and it could change it however it wanted.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Ling Han was like a god of destruction, forcefully opening up a path.

However, the ground here was incomparably firm, and could even withstand a Sixth-Tier attack. Although Ling Han’s current strength had far surpassed the Sixth Tier, the ground here was too thick. Ling Han’s punch could blast out a huge hole that was over 50 km deep, but what was the overall thickness?

This greatly limited Ling Han’s speed, and Hysteria’s tentacle naturally caught up to him easily.

Ling Han turned to face the attack. Peng! The tentacle whipped over, instantly sending him flying. However, relying on the power of Hysteria’s attack, Ling Han forcefully shattered a large area behind him.

His face was slightly flushed. This attack had almost shattered his defense. Even so, his internal organs had still suffered some impact, making him feel a little uncomfortable.

However, there was no time for him to adjust. He immediately restored his defenses and continued to charge forward.

Hysteria chased after Ling Han, while Ling Han ran for his life.

He felt like he was walking on the edge of life and death again, which allowed him to gain endless enlightenment, as if there were flowers blooming in the Void.

After escaping this time, he would definitely be able to improve greatly.

It had been a long time since he had experienced such a feeling. As his strength reached the peak of the Seventh Tier, the only thing in the world that could threaten his life was Hysteria.

Ling Han continuously endured the bombardment of Hysteria, and blood was already seeping out from the corner of his mouth. On the second day, the skin all over his body had cracked open, and blood gushed out, dyeing his entire body red.

The speed of his return was too slow. Originally, it had only taken him half a day to charge his way over, but now it had already been a day, and he was only halfway there.

One more day.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. This escape was abnormally arduous, but if he couldn’t endure it, he would die. Under the threat of death, he unearthed his potential further, and boundless power surged out of his body, supporting him to continuously persevere.

Hysteria was also shocked. It would have been fine if Ling Han had been in the Seventh Tier, but he was clearly only in the Sixth Tier, and did not have an undying and indestructible physique, so how could he persist for such a long time under its frenzied bombardment?

Such a person… could not be left alive.

Its attacks became more and more violent. Previously, it had only lashed out with one tentacle, but now there were two of them. After another half a day, the number had increased to three.

An additional tentacle wasn’t just a change in quantity. Indeed, its power had also increased greatly. The three tentacles lashed out wildly, and their attacks were as violent as a tidal wave.

Boom!

There were also spiritual attacks that condensed into heavenly spears that stabbed towards Ling Han, intending to destroy his mind.

However, there were millions of dimensions in Ling Han’s body, and every dimension had developed life. Even if they were just ordinary birds, beasts, or in fact just plants, they still contained a trace of consciousness.

When these consciousnesses were combined, how powerful could they be?

Hysteria’s spiritual assault came crashing over, but it was caught by these consciousnesses and disintegrated bit by bit. By the time it finally reached Ling Han’s mind, it was already spent, and no longer had any destructive power.

Even a being as strong as Hysteria had its limits.

“Hahaha, Hysteria, I’ll remember this debt for now. It won’t be long before I suppress you,” Ling Han said as he sped away.

“There won’t be a next time!” Hysteria balefully said as it brandished its fourth tentacle.

If it couldn’t kill Ling Han this time, then there would really be nothing it could do when Ling Han advanced into the Seventh Tier and attained an undying and indestructible physique.

Of course, if it could devour the entire Genesis World, its power would reach a new height, and killing a Seventh Tier would become possible.

Ling Han roared madly, breaking through the siege all the way, as if he had gone mad.

Peng!

A passageway appeared diagonally in front of them.

Even Hysteria couldn’t affect the passageway of the two realms. Now that he was here, it was finally a smooth path.

Ling Han, on the other hand, sneered coldly. He did not head towards that passageway at all, and instead continued to charge forward.

‘I haven’t reached the passageway of the two realms yet,’ Ling Han thought to himself. How long had his journey been? He knew very well, and a passageway of the two realms had appeared here?

It was too early.

Therefore, this one had to be fake.

If Ling Han really turned into this passage, it would definitely not lead to the Profound Negative Realm, but to the interior of Hysteria’s body. Then, he might not be able to walk out of it for the rest of his life.

This was a trap that Hysteria had set for him. Since this was the interior of Hysteria, creating such an environment was simply too easy.

However, after advancing another 9000 meters, another passageway appeared in front of Ling Han, and there were two of them!

Ling Han hesitated slightly. According to his calculations, the passageway of the two realms should be here, but two had actually appeared? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

One of them was definitely fake, and it was created by Hysteria. If he walked into it, he might unknowingly be led into the interior of Hysteria.

Which one was it?

He would know after walking for a while. In any case, a spatial passageway was only so long. After walking for a while, it should be the Profound Negative Realm. If he couldn’t reach the other end, he could immediately turn back.

He chose the passage on the right side.

Xiu, he leaped into the passageway, and in just two or three steps, a familiar sky appeared in front of him, and a familiar power assaulted his face.

This was the aura that belonged solely to the Profound Negative Realm.
