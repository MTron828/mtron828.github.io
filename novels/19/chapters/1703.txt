Chapter 1704: One move

If Tong Lin still had awareness after death, he would definitely be very depressed.

Why did Changsun Liang kill him? There was completely no logic to it!

He had been awoken by the commotion created by the battle between Ling Han and the red-haired young man. The moment he awoke, he discovered his embarrassing state, hurriedly drew out some clothing to change into from his Spatial God Tool, and anxiously ran over to tell on Ling Han.

He was sure that Changsun Liang would definitely demand justice for his sake, but he had never imagined that Changsun Liang would kill him with a single palm strike without another word; he was really unlucky to the extreme.

Blood was still splashing in the air, and a few drops sprayed onto Liu Muyu’s face, causing her running steps to come to an abrupt stop.

Only now did she realize that Tong Lin had died, and he had actually been killed with a single palm strike from Changsun Liang.

‘What’s going on?’

Her face had turned completely pale from fear, her legs trembling, fearing that Changsun Liang would follow up with another blow and kill her as well.

“Lord Holy Son, spare me! Lord Holy Son, spare me!” She knelt, her tears pouring like rain. She was indeed a completely unreasonable, incredibly ferocious person, but that would depend on who was in front of her.

Changsun Liang showed a hint of disdain. This definitely had to be the cheap sl*t who had engaged in public s*x with Tong Lin; such a ***** was actually able to come to his residence?

“Scram!” he rebuked loudly.

“Yes, yes, yes.” Liu Muyu did not even dare to say another word, and hurriedly turned around and ran.

Changsun Liang took a deep breath, regaining control of his emotions. Only then did he realize that he had gone too far with his actions. No matter what, the Tong Clan was a fourth severance force. But since he was already killed, he would not keep thinking about it with his personality.

He looked towards Ling Han, a slight smile appearing on his lips. He began to clap loudly. “Exciting, truly exciting!”

Everyone was speechless. You were so furious that you killed Tong Lin, and now you are clapping your hands in praise; this was really too fake. However, this person was the Holy Son of the Black Moon Sect, so who would dare approach and rebuke him?

Changsun Liang continued, “Is there anyone who would like to spar with this person?”

No one answered. From Ling Han’s previous performance, he was definitely of the same level as Yuan Xingping and Dan Yujing, his strength extremely overwhelming and strong. Though Black Moon City was a Two Star City, and there were many, many more prodigies here than in a One Star City, there really were not many the likes of Yuan Xingping. Moreover, even if they were, they might not have the absolute certainty that they could defeat Ling Han.

No wonder the incredibly proud Empress had chosen him; this was definitely not an idiot that only had his looks going for him.

Changsun Liang’s expression was slightly awkward; there was actually no one that was willing to move out?

Who was he? Could it be that he would have to personally stand against Ling Han??

Changsun Liang humphed in displeasure. They didn’t even want to give this little bit of face to the one and only Holy Son?

“Hoho, as untalented as I am, I would like to ask for some guidance from this brother.” A young man emerged from the crowd. He fIrst bowed slightly towards Changsun Liang before turning to face Ling Han.

Immediately, Changsun Liang’s expression looked considerably better. This young man was the prodigy of the Xiang Clan, Xiang Wenkun. He was very strong and capable enough to gain his approval.

With Xiang Wenkun moving out, this matter was assuredly resolved.

Ling Han faintly, and said, “Come on then, I will give you some guidance.”

Xiang Wenkun showed a hint of anger. When he said “guidance”, he was only being polite. He had not thought that Ling Han would take him literally.

Humph, he was just a country bumpkin that had come from a tiny One Star City. He really had an exaggerated opinion of his strength!

It made sense. After he had gained some strength, he was naturally invincible in a small city, and thought that there were no other elites in this world, and became unbearably arrogant.

What ignorance.

“Then let us fight!” He did not bother to waste words, and made a hooking motion with his finger towards Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled slightly, raised a single finger, and said, “One move.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Hiss, everyone inhaled sharply.

You wanted to take Xiang Wenkun down with a single strike? Where had this courage come from!

On the contrary, Xiang Wenkun was so angered he smiled, and declared, “Then let it be one strike!” He stared at Ling Han, his Origin Power channeling. A sword-shaped mark appeared in the middle of his brow, and a primitive, ancient intimidation radiated out, making everyone feel as if a large rock was weighing down on their hearts, which was incredibly uncomfortable.

He had used a strong move. This was the power of his battle prowess, being able to draw on the powers of their ancient ancestors, increasing his battle prowess greatly.

Victory with a single strike!

Ling Han crossed his arms behind his back, and allowed his opponent to prepare for his powerful move, looking like he had completely no intention of moving to interrupt him. Nor did he plan to make any preparations for his own powerful attack.

‘Arrogant!’ everyone thought. That was Xiang Wenkun here, and even if it was Yuan Xingping or Dan Yujing facing him, they would have to be extremely cautious. If they did not go all out, they would definitely be obliterated and turn into dust in an instant.

“Frozen Divine Sword!” Xiang Wenkun exclaimed, and tapped on his forehead. Xiu, that sword-shaped mark actually turned into a Divine Sword that slashed out. Suddenly, the temperature in the surroundings began to drop madly. Everyone in the area felt as if their blood was about to freeze in their veins, and when they wanted to move about, they discovered that their limbs had already been frozen stiff, with a thick layer of ice having formed on their bodies.

Hiss, this was only a secondary effect, and its might was already so frightening. If one was really struck by this Frozen Divine Sword, would there be any chance of survival?

This strike was so fast that it was indescribable.

But Ling Han smiled faintly, and calmly tapped out a single finger, which just happened to tap on the tip of this sword.

‘So accurate! So fast!’ everyone exclaimed in shock in their minds. But then they immediately shook their heads. The coldness that this sword exuded was so terrifying, and you actually met it with your bare hand; wasn’t that simply courting death?

Pa, the icy sword immediately shattered, but the coldness had been completely transferred to Ling Han, freezing him instantly.

Xiang Wenkun involuntarily showed an expression of pride. This was the consequence of angering him.

Boom, a flame ignited from Ling Han’s body, and the layer of ice instantly melted. Ling Han’s finger continued to tap out, growing to the size of a mountain peak, and pressed down on Xiang Wenkun.

Xiang Wenkun paled in shock. The range that this finger covered was really too wide. There was absolutely no way for him to dodge. He could only explode with his full power, and throw a series of punches at the skies.

Boom, boom, boom, punches landed on that finger one after another, yet they did not have the slightest effect. The giant finger fell without obstruction. Boom, Xiang Wenkun’s figure had immediately disappeared. When Ling Han lifted his finger, they could see that Xiang Wenkun was already sprawled out on the ground.

One move, he had indeed used only a single move.

Even as strong as Xiang Wenkun was, he had already prepared a long time to build up enough power to unleash a strong move, yet he had still been dealt with by a single move. Just how wide was the gap in power between the two of them? It should be known that Ling Han had not made any preparations at all, and had only very casually flicked out a finger.

This time, even Changsun Liang was moved.

He looked at Ling Han, and said, “Three eras ago, a Mao Dai appeared in Dark Moon City. He swept aside all other young prodigies, and was known as a supreme prodigy. If it was up to me, I would say that you are much stronger than Mao Dai had been at that time.”

This was a very high assessment. At the time, Mao Dai had defeated all the Saint Kings, and emerged as a powerful force of his own. Even now, it was still discussed enthusiastically. This was indeed a super genius, and even the Fu Clan had the intention to take him in. His future achievement would definitely not be limited to merely the fourth severance.

But Changsun Liang actually said that Ling Han was stronger than Mao Dai had been. Wasn’t that a little exaggerated?

“You... are worthy of having a battle with me!” Changsun Liang declared proudly. He was already standing at the peak stage of Saint King Tier, and was only waiting for the Severing Mundane Pool to open, and he would be able to sever his mortal bonds and become immortal. In a battle of equals, he was confident that he was unmatched.
