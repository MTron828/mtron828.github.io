Chapter 1645: Interaction

“Interesting,” Ling Han said softly, and with a thought, he had drawn the black panther into the Black Tower.

‘Even if your power is Saint Tier, so what?’ Having entered into the Black Tower, it belonged to him now.

Meanwhile, Long Yushan was stunned. Ling Han actually just took a Saint Tier Demonic Beast into his Spatial God Tool just like that? Weren’t you afraid that this black panther would suddenly go on a vicious rampage, and destroy that Spatial God Tool of yours?

Oh, Spatial God Tools were not Saint Tools. Aside from being able to contain living creatures, they might not be all that much sturdier than normal Spatial Spirit Tools.

“Why did that panther not gain intelligence?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also very curious.

Ling Han hummed for awhile, and then said, “Our human race is called the most intelligent of all life, but if one has been living in a forest that is completely remote and removed from everything else since childhood, then he may possibly survive, but his intelligence would definitely be very low, and he would probably only be left with the instincts to live, right?”

“But this black panther can cultivate. Being able to cultivate to such heights, how could it possibly still be so primitive?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden did not agree with such an explanation.

“Perhaps its bloodline is strong enough. As long as it could grow naturally, it would be Genesis Tier!” Ling Han stated slowly.

Gasp!

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others all inhaled sharply at the same time. That was too frightening, wasn’t it? It would be in the Genesis Tier if it matured naturally, so how terrifying would this breed be? If there were slightly more of their number, then wouldn’t they be capable of conquering the whole Immortal Realm?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It should be the unique environment here. The Spiritual Qi here is too dense, which gave rise to such conditions. Of course, the bloodline of that black panther must be of a very high grade as well. Perhaps it has an ancestor in the Severing Mundane Tier or even Dividing Soul Tier. It is a Demonic Beast, after all. It does not have the learning ability and strong adapting ability of humans, but in terms of bloodline inheritance, it has more of an advantage.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others accepted that kind of explanation. Incomparable conditions for cultivation added with bloodline inheritance indeed could create such an elite that only knew slaughter and bloodshed.

“Is the whole Celestial Realm that frightening?” Long Yushan asked.

True Dragons should be superior to millions and millions of living creatures, but now in a condition of equal cultivation levels, her dragon’s might actually did not have the slightest effect on the black panther, which meant that the latter’s cultivation level was not inferior to hers at all. This was a considerable blow to her superiority complex that had developed through the years.

Ling Han and the others shook their heads. They hadn’t gone to the Celestial Realm before, and had only heard that there were even more elites there. Genesis Tiers basically could only be considered ants there.

It was like one that had come from a small world; what was a Shattering Void Tier worth?

For cultivators, this was a choice.

...You could proclaim yourself ruler in a small world, but the price for that would be your lifespan. A Shattering Void Tier could only live for around 1,000 years, but once they advanced to the Mountain River Tier, their lifespan would immediately spike to 100,000 years!

“Who knows how many Demonic Beasts there are here that are like this black panther,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said. Then, she turned to look at Ling Han, her expression filled with worry.

If there were Saint King-level beings, then even with the strength of the Empress and the Rain Emperor, they could only flee. They hadn’t come back out even after so many years. One possibility was that they had found some great fortune here, and another was that they had encountered grave trouble.

Ling Han nodded. He wanted to divine the whereabouts of the Empress, but there was a mysterious force here that was concealing the twists of fate, so he was completely unable to divine it at all.

If this truly was a part of the Celestial Realm that had fallen, then what would Genesis Tiers be worth in the Celestial Realm? It was absolutely normal that he was incapable of making a divination.

They continued on their way up the mountain, but they still did not see other signs of life in the surrounding area. It was as if all the Demonic Beasts had been killed by that black panther from before.

There was also day and night here, but it was not light at day and dark at night. Instead, there was half the time that the skies would be golden, and the skies would be silvery the other half of the time. It was unknown which was day and which one was night.

There was no sun, no moon, and no stars. There was only the continuous range of mountains that seemed to have existed for eternity.

‘We’ll just consider the golden time as day, and the silvery time as night.’

A day passed, and they all felt weary, so they stopped for a rest.

This was very inconceivable. They were all Saints, and they would actually feel tired after journeying for a day! It should be known that Ling Han had battled fiercely with the Open Clouds King for four years straight, and hadn’t he still come out of it filled with energy and zest?

It could only be said that this place was very amazing.

Long Yushan released Long Xiangyue from the Spatial God Tool, while Ling Han drew out ingredients from the Black Tower, which he handed over to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the other women to cook. Not too long after, a fragrant aroma was released, greatly exciting their appetites.

After a simple meal, Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden entered into the Black Tower, and Long Yushan and her niece did not suspect anything. They had all reached Saint Tier, so wouldn’t it be very normal for them to have Spatial God Tools?

She and Long Xiangyue also entered into her Spatial God Tool. She wanted to have a good talk with this niece of hers.

“Xiangyue, that man could not possibly like you. You had best sever this ill-fated affection as soon as possible to avoid being wounded too deeply!” she said.

Long Xiangyue pouted. After a while, she softly said, “I know. He has a wife that is indescribably beautiful, so it is absolutely normal that he can’t appreciate such a commonplace woman as myself.”

Hearing these words from her, Long Yushan was not satisfied, and she said, “Even if that person does not like you, you do not have to feel inferior. With your qualifications, you would qualify as a match for any man in this world.”

Long Xiangyue shook her head. “Aunty, you haven’t seen that empress before. She is really a peerless beauty. If I was a man, I would definitely fall for her as well. There is really no comparison.”

Long Yushan was astonished. For exquisite beauties like themselves, they would admit that they were inferior to others in cultivation level, but in the area of beauty, they had absolute confidence in themselves, and thought that even if there were others that matched their beauty, it was impossible any who surpassed them existed!

Long Xiangyue was actually completely bowled over by that so-called empress, which naturally made her feel very surprised. Just how beautiful could she be that Long Xiangyue would admit that she was inferior?

“Aunty, why don’t we marry Ling Han together!” Long Xiangyue suddenly suggested shockingly.

“...” Long Yushan.

“On our own, we have no advantage, but it would be different if we are together. Both aunt and niece are two beautiful flowers, so who would not want to pluck these two exquisite blooms?” The more Long Xiangyue said, the more daring she became. “Only with that would we be able to barely compete with that empress.”

“You’re babbling nonsense!” Long Yushan suddenly rebuked.

“Aunty, don’t tell me that you have no feelings for him!” Long Xiangyue threw everything to the winds. “If you like him, you should pursue him. If you missed him, that would be a real pity. Don’t tell me that you want to regret not having been more courageous today when you’re old?”

“Damn girl, don’t say anymore!” Long Yushan rebuked. This was really utterly ridiculous. She actually wanted both aunt and niece to marry the same person. Just the mere thought of it made her furious.

Long Xiangyue did not reply, but her expression was stubborn. This was the only possibility that she could think of that would make Ling Han interested in her.

‘The journey is long, so let us just slowly wait. Even if you are a proud woman, we can slowly grind your pride away!’

Long Yushan did not know that this niece of hers was digging a trap for her presently. She was only vexed. This girl had really sunk deep into the mud; she was almost close to madness.

She also firmed her resolve; she was determined to pull Long Xiangyue back to her senses.

The two women exchanged a look, both of them wearing an expression of determination.
