Chapter 1896: Not So Fast!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhao Qingfeng was dazed as he stared at Ling Han, and his expression was as strange as could be.

In his memory, Ling Han’s battle prowess was only at a similar level to his. It was only because Ling Han’s defensive ability was slightly more powerful that he had lost during their previous battle. Apart from that, he had possessed countless opportunities to defeat Ling Han during their first battle.

This time, however, the gulf between their battle prowess was astonishing.

He had unleashed his pinnacle attack, yet Ling Han had blocked it with just one finger. Moreover, he was extremely calm and composed, and it was as if he were simply battling against some random dog or cat.

This caused him to think of Yan Xianlu. Before Yan Xianlu had advanced to the fifth severance, he had also been as weak and fragile as could be before him. What supreme prodigy? He was nothing but an insect.

Was this brat going to become the second Yan Xianlu?

His mind whirred, yet the flesh on his face started to peel off bit by bit. There was no blood, and it was as if he had truly transformed into copper. However, he was decaying copper right now, and it was because of this that he was falling apart.

He had unleashed his pinnacle strike just then. If he succeeded, he would ascend to a new height. If he failed, however, he would never be able to recover.

The copper started to disintegrate into dust, flying into the distance with the wind.

Everyone fell silent. No one could refute Zhao Qingfeng’s power. He was a prodigy even more powerful than many Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of Celestial King Tier forces. Now, however, he had died... such a worthless death.

Indeed, he couldn’t even draw a single drop of blood from Ling Han.

Zhao Qingfeng opened his mouth to speak his final words. “You’re indeed very powerful! I admit my loss! However, you’re definitely no match for Lord Holy Son! I’m going to die soon, but you won’t live for much longer! With your personality, you definitely won’t submit to the Holy Son. However, the Holy Son definitely won’t allow such a thing to happen!”

As he said this, his movements became slightly exaggerated, and this caused the surrounding wind to pick up speed. When he finished speaking, his entire body disintegrated into pieces that blew away with the wind.

The life force that belonged to him vanished without a trace. There was no more Zhao Qingfeng in this world.

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. Regardless of whether Zhao Qingfeng was warning him or cursing him, this didn’t affect his Dao Heart in the least.

In a battle of equal levels, he wouldn’t be afraid of anyone.

So what if Yan Xianlu was powerful? He would be nothing more than a stepping stone in his path of seeking Dao. He would help Ling Han ascend to a new level.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng also smiled upon seeing this. Although Zhao Qingfeng’s death was a significant matter, the Eternal Prosperity Sect also had to speak reason, no? Even if Yan Xianlu didn’t speak reason, he was only a Holy Son, a mere Severing Mundane Tier Holy Son.

Time. What his disciple needed was time. As long as he had enough time, he would be able to peer down at the entire world.

“Heh, let’s continue,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said. Although an unexpected interruption had occurred, this had instead helped to solidify Ling Han’s position.

Of course, he would definitely conduct a thorough investigation once this ceremony was over. He would find who had let Zhao Qingfeng out.

“Not so fast!” another person suddenly shouted.

F*ck! What was going on today? Why was everyone seeking to interrupt the ceremony?

An old man stepped forward from the crowd of spectators. His hands were clasped behind his back, and he was radiating with a powerful aura.

“Lu Jin!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said with a frown.

Lu Jin was a Three-Star Alchemist. However, he also had another identity—he was an Ascending Origin Tier elite. Thus, Lu Jin was extremely arrogant and self-important, and he didn’t really listen to others. Moreover, he was indeed a talented alchemist, and he had the potential to become a Four-Star Alchemist.

However, to suddenly step forward at this moment... This caused Alchemist Zi Cheng to become extremely displeased. He wouldn’t mind using his power as chairperson to kick Lu Jin out from the ceremony.

Lu Jin clasped his hands, and said, “Chairperson!” His expression was haughty, and it was clear that he didn’t hold much respect for Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

Everyone gasped upon seeing this.

Just then, Zhao Qingfeng stepping forward was already a very big issue. Now, another person in Lu Jin was stepping forward? Perhaps... Alchemy City was going to experience some unexpected change?

“What’s wrong?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked in displeasure. Lu Jin was definitely stepping forward at this moment on purpose. However, he was a Three-Star Alchemist, and he was more so an Ascending Origin Tier elite, so Alchemist Zi Cheng definitely had to give him some face.

“I have an important matter to report!” Lu Jin said loudly. His voice was like booming thunder.

Under the might of an Ascending Origin Tier elite, Ling Han’s radiance was instantly swept away.

“What’s the matter? Do you have to report it now?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked in a baleful voice. If Lu Jin couldn’t give him a good reason, he would definitely give him a good beating.

A smile tugged at the corners of Lu Jin’s lips, and he said, “Because of this matter, this measly Holy Son ceremony can be tossed aside.”

What an arrogant tone!

Alchemy City had invited numerous forces to this ceremony. Not only were countless three-star forces present, but there were also many four-star forces present. They were all here for the Holy Son ceremony. Yet, Lu Jin was claiming that this ceremony could be tossed aside? How preposterous!

“Oh?” Alchemist Zi Cheng couldn’t be bothered speaking any more nonsense. He looked at Lu Jin, waiting for further explanation. If Lu Jin couldn’t give a good explanation, he wouldn’t need to give him any more face.

“It’s because I...” Lu Jin pointed at himself, and his voice became countless times louder as he said, “I’ve already advanced to become a Four-Star Alchemist!”

Four-Star Alchemist, Four-Star Alchemist, Four-Star Alchemist...

His voice echoed around the plaza.

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this. Only after several dozen seconds did someone finally gasp in deep astonishment. The plaza then descended into commotion.

A Four-Star Alchemist!

There were only three Four-Star Alchemists in Alchemy City, and indeed, in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm! To become a Four-Star Alchemist was equivalent to becoming a Celestial King!

Just what kind of concept was Celestial King?

This was indeed a significant matter. Compared to this, crowning a new Holy Son was indeed a measly matter of little importance. It was far too insignificant.

Just then, Grandmaster Zi Cheng could still suppress Lu Jin using his status as chairperson and a Four-Star Alchemist. Now, however... their status was equal.

A Four-Star Alchemist! This status was far too transcendent! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If conflict occurred among the Four-Star Alchemists, it was extremely likely that this would result in the fracturing of Alchemy City. This was because there were far too few Four-Star Alchemists. Any one of them could create a supremely powerful force.

Alchemist Zi Cheng faltered for a moment. He had many things to consider. Lu Jin advancing to become a Four-Star Alchemist and Zhao Qingfeng suddenly advancing and stepping forward to challenge Ling Han... Right now, he could seemingly link these two matters together.

This was no simple matter!

However, he remained calm and composed. After living for so many billions of years, he could definitely keep his emotions under control. His voice was calm as he said, “Do you have any proof?”

“This is a four-star Celestial pill that I just finished refining 11 days ago! You guys can appraise it!” Lu Jin flicked his finger as he said this.

Whoosh!

A streak of white light shot toward Alchemist Chu Ye.

He hadn’t given it to Alchemist Zi Cheng, and he was instead giving it to Alchemist Chu Ye. There was definitely something fishy about this.

Alchemist Chu Ye was currently enjoying wine from his calabash, and when the pill vial flew over, he casually reached over to catch it. A white pill vial appeared in his hand. At the same time, an expression of reluctance appeared on his face as he put his calabash down. He then opened the seal of the pill vial.

This kind of Celestial pill was far too valuable, and losing any iota of its aura would be a significant loss. Thus, it had to be stored in a sealed vial.

Alchemist Zi Cheng and Alchemist Heavenly Heart both shuffled over to look at the vial.

The surrounding spectators also stood on their tippy-toes, hopeful that they could catch a glance.

Weng!

The alchemical pill had yet to appear, yet a streak of azure aura had already risen into the air. This aura didn’t dissipate in the sky, and it instead transformed into the figure of a small fox. Its eyes were extremely large, and it was as adorable as could be.
