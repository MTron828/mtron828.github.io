Lian Xuerong shouted and charged towards this huge creature. She waved the long whip in her hand and lashed at the giant elephant.

Pa!

The whip struck the foot of the giant elephant, and a golden light flashed. The giant elephant let out a painful roar, and its foot slipped and stepped onto the side.

Hong, the ground shook violently like a rippling carpet.

“A Blood Transformation Tier-level Demonic Beast!” Ling Han took a look, and immediately concluded. That boiling Qi and blood was astonishing to the extreme, revealing its fiendishness, causing the faces of all the warriors to turn deathly pale. Merely continuing to stand was a huge burden.

Lian Xuerong shouted again. She raised her whip and attacked.

This giant elephant was not only in the Blood Transformation Tier, but its size was also really too big. With just a single step, its destructive power to ordinary people would be incomparably terrifying.

Shua, the giant elephant swung its long trunk which whipped towards Lian Xuerong like it was a tall building.

Lian Xuerong leaped up. She could no longer change her trajectory and could only fight head-on with this giant elephant.

BANG!

She pressed down with her palm, and then she was sent flying into the crowd of Demonic Beasts in the distance. In contrast, the giant elephant only trembled slightly.

Its astonishing size had made a contribution. To send it flying, they would probably have to mobilize Extreme Bone Tier elites.

Why was it said that Demonic Beasts were stronger than martial artists of the same level? This was the reason!

“Banner Lord!” The warriors of the Xuanqing Banner shouted.

“Banner Lord Lian is fine, everyone follow me quickly!” Ling Han said loudly. Lian Xuerong was a Third Change Blood Transformation Tier, so even if she was no match, she could easily escape. However, if everyone wanted to stay here and not leave, then they would only be trampled to death by the giant elephant.

“Leave!” Lian Xuerong’s voice came from afar, full of vigor.

When everyone heard this, they were relieved and quickly ran away.

However, how could they run fast in such an environment?

In just a few breaths, the giant elephant had already made a comeback and stomped down again.

It was as if the heavens were collapsing, terrifying to the extreme!

Ling Han could not do anything else. He could only leap high into the air, and then throw a punch.

BANG!

This punch was solid, and Ling Han felt as if an entire celestial body was crushing down on him. His chest felt like it was boiling, and it was extremely uncomfortable.

This was because he had released his strength. Otherwise, if this foot had stepped on him solidly, he would have been ten times more miserable.

He fell and barely managed to turn around, allowing his feet to land on the ground first. He swayed on his feet and he almost fell down.

Fortunately, the giant elephant was also slightly deflected by this punch. Peng, the giant foot landed 9 metres away from them, setting off a powerful shockwave that caused the nearby people and Demonic Beasts to be thrown off their feet.

“Brother Ling!” The other soldiers hurriedly called out.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “I’m fine!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He activated the broken sword in his hand and slashed out. Instantly, a not-so-brilliant flash of Sword Qi immediately slashed towards the giant elephant.

Pu!

When the Sword Qi entered the elephant’s calf, blood spurted out. There was also the sound of the elephant in pain. It was incomparably loud and shook the surroundings.

The broken sword was a Spirit Tool, and its level might be extremely high. Therefore, although the Sword Qi slashed out did not have much power, its sharpness was incomparably shocking, causing great damage to this giant elephant.

Hong, the giant elephant flailed its trunk in pain. Peng, peng, peng, the elephant’s trunk crushed through the ground, and dozens of Demonic Beasts were instantly smashed to death, turning into a bloody mist.

This made the warriors of the Xuanqing Banner shiver. If they were hit by the elephant’s trunk, they would definitely end up like this.

“Let’s go!” Sun Jianfang jumped out. He led the way in front, with Ling Han bringing up the rear.

Although he had just advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier, he was still the third elite in the team after all. Now that Lian Xuerong was charging over from afar, he didn’t shirk his responsibilities and took over the responsibility of opening the path for the vanguard.

The giant elephant went berserk. It didn’t care about anything else and trampled everywhere. It was simply the best description of a terrible teammate. In just a few moments, hundreds of Demonic Beasts were trampled to death by it. Its efficiency was shockingly high.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be delighted. If this giant elephant was used well, it could completely be used as a super killing weapon to annihilate the beast tide.

However, before he could rejoice for long, the giant elephant actually calmed down unbelievably. Its eyes flashed with a blood-red ferocious light as it stared at him.

F***!

The giant elephant raised its trunk high into the air, and then viciously whipped it towards Ling Han.

It was a Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beast to begin with, and with its huge body and astonishing brute force, if it waved its trunk that was like a skyscraper to attack, this destructive power would probably cause even Extreme Bone Tier cultivators to frown, right?

If he wanted to kill this Demonic Beast, he could only avoid confronting it head-on, slaughter his way in through its eyes and ears, and directly crush its brain. Otherwise, if he were to face it head-on, he believed that even Extreme Bone Tier elites would have to spend some effort to deal with it.

“Spread out!” Ling Han shouted loudly. He exerted all his strength to meet the strike, and block the brunt of the strike.

BANG!

His entire body was sent flying. The force of 500,000 kilograms was indeed very strong, but against this giant elephant, it only made its trunk pause slightly.

The Xuanqing Banner warriors immediately scattered like birds. If they were still gathered together, they would only die quickly.

However, even so, this flick of the trunk still sent seven warriors flying. Before they landed, they were already dead.

“Damn it!” Ling Han roared furiously. He brandished the broken sword, and continuously shot out Sword Qi. Pu, pu, pu, pu! The size of the giant elephant was an advantage, but at the same time, it also became a huge target, and there was almost no way to dodge any attack.

Pu, pu, pu, pu! The Sword Qi continuously slashed into the giant elephant’s body, causing it to roar in pain. However, this time, it did not lose control. Instead, its eyes became even more bloodshot and savage as it stared fixedly at Ling Han.

On the other side, Lian Xuerong had already charged over and was reassembling her team.

Ling Han was slightly relieved. He roared, and said, “I’ll go kill this giant elephant!”

Xiu, his figure shot up, and with a leap, he had already leaped onto one of the giant elephant’s legs. The giant elephant’s leg hair was like long spears, thick, hard, and long. Ling Han used it as a platform, and with a series of stomps, he quickly headed towards the giant elephant’s head.

Although the giant elephant was an obvious target, if one wanted to kill it, they had to slash Sword Qi into its eyes and ears. If they were still standing below, it would be very difficult to hit it.

Moreover, the giant elephant was not stupid. It was indeed difficult to dodge with its huge body, but it only needed to tilt its head.

Thus, Ling Han had to go up.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! In just a few moments, Ling Han had already appeared on one of the giant elephant’s tusks. He was just about to slash at its eyes when he suddenly felt his spirit go into a trance, as if something was trying to possess him.

The purple pendant glowed slightly, and Ling Han’s spiritual power was also counterattacking. Boom, this evil will was driven out of his mind.

Ling Han was shocked. He raised his head and looked up, only to see that there was actually a Demonic Beast sitting on top of the giant elephant’s head. It was like a tiger, but it had no fur, and its entire body was covered with tentacles that were a foot long.

This was the kind of Demonic Beast that was good at spiritual control from Thousand Lotus Mountain.

It turned out that it was controlling the giant elephant!
