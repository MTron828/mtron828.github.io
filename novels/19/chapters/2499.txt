Chapter 2500: Merging two realms

??

Who was this person?

None of them recognized him, yet they felt a chill rise up from the bottoms of their hearts, because not one of them knew when exactly he had appeared among them.

This person… Just how strong was he?

“Yi, the precious light is coming from you?” This tall, sturdy man set his eyes on Ling Han, and then his gaze became harsh. “Was it you that consumed the exceptional precious herb?”

“What if I did, and what if I did not?” Ling Han countered calmly. The other party’s strength could not be hidden from him at all. This was a Genesis Tier Saint, and a Great Saint at that. But in his eyes, so what if he was a Great Saint?

“If you did, I will refine you into an alchemical pill!” this Great Saint declared coldly.

“How dare you!!” Zhao Xin and the others shouted.

“En?” The Great Saint glared at them, with a frightening aura spreading out, causing everyone to feel their hearts constrict, which was an indescribably terrible feeling.

“In front of me, what gives you people the right to speak?” With a thought from him, over a dozen fists instantly rose up from the ground, barrelling towards Zhao Xin and the others.

“S-Saint!” Zhao Xin and the others said in shaking voices. With this attack, they could confirm who he was without a doubt.

This was a Saint, the strongest existence in the Immortal Realm, especially when a great event happened several tens of thousands of years ago. Countless Saints had disappeared in unison, and there were only few that remained. Naturally, all of them were supreme beings.

Peng, peng, peng, peng.?These fists had not destroyed them when they were all turned back into dust. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“En?” This Great Saint’s eyes widened, and he finally looked serious. “Who are you, sir?” He discovered that Ling Han’s cultivation level was in no way inferior to his own.

“Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” this Great Saint murmured, his brow slightly furrowed. He thought that this name was a little familiar; he seemed to have heard it somewhere before.

“Kneel and apologize, and I will spare your life,” Ling Han stated.

If this had been several tens of thousands of years ago, and someone threatened to kill him, he would definitely have killed him instead. But because his body had just recovered, he was in a good mood. Thus, he was willing to give the other party a chance of survival.

That Great Saint flew into a great rage. He was a Saint, and someone actually dared to demand him to kneel. Did he have a screw loose in his head?

He couldn’t be bothered to think further about who Ling Han was. Instead, he moved directly.?Hong, a palm struck out, and all the stars in the skies trembled.

This was the might of a Saint. Ling Han had massacred the Immortal Realm in the past, and a great number of Saints had died. There were also many Saints that he had brought with him into the Celestial Realm, There were only a few Saints that were still present.

Ling Han pretended he did not see anything. However, when the attack was just about to land on his head, it all stopped, and strangely floated in mid-air.

This scene was very grand. Countless attacks descended, as if capable of destroying worlds. In fact, it was no problem for these attacks to destroy even this planet, yet they had now all stopped, going against any rule.

Hong, long, long, furious thunder rang out in the heaven and earth. This was the heaven and earth beginning to target him as it discovered that a being that was stronger than this realm had appeared.

Every realm had its own rules. An existence that was too strong could not appear and damage the balance.

Ling Han rebuked sharply, and pointed at the skies.?Peng, the furious thunder that filled the skies instantly dispersed.

He was a Celestial King, and had once been the overlord of a realm himself. His level far surpassed the Ancient Realm. This point of his finger and a sharp rebuke possessed boundless might.

Everyone was watching dumbfounded. That was a heavenly tribulation; a heavenly tribulation could actually be rebuked into retreating?

That Great Saint’s legs were shaking. “You, y-y-y-you come from the legendary Celestial Realm!” His expression suddenly changed drastically as it suddenly came back to him. “Ling Han! You are Ling Han! You are that Ling Han!” In the past, Ling Han had killed a great many Saints, and the news had spread throughout the entire Immortal Realm. However, there were some places that were really too far away, and who knew how much time had passed until they finally received the news. Many people did not even believe that this was true.

Yet, now that the person himself had appeared to him, and his own attacks had stopped strangely, with the heavenly tribulation being rebuked into retreat. Was that not enough proof?

Ling Han shook his head. “I gave you a chance, but you refused!”

He moved, compressing all the attacks into a sphere of light, which he then stuffed into the mouth of that Great Saint. With a light smack, the sphere of light was swallowed into the Great Saint’s stomach.

“Milord, spare—” That Great Saint was naturally almost shocked to death, and wanted to beg for mercy.?Peng, the light sphere suddenly exploded within his body, and he was instantly turned into pieces. However, the aftermath of the explosion did not spread out, but was rather restrained in a small area.

For Ling Han, this naturally was easily done.

Zhao Xin and the others were all bursting with shock. They had already estimated Ling Han hightly, and thought that he was a Genesis Tier Saint. They had not thought that even this was an underestimation. This guy was who knew how many times more awesome than any Saint.

Ling Han swept an eye over them, and said, “Our intertwined fates will also come to an end today.”

“Milord!” everyone hurriedly said. Ling Han saying these words meant he was going to leave.

Ling Han waved a hand. “All good things must come to an end. Work hard on your cultivation. If you can advance further, there may be a day when we will meet again.”

He was not the maudlin type. With a step, he had already traversed an extremely far distance.

He had long since repaid the kindness that had been given to him. Furthermore, he had other affairs, so it was naturally impossible for him to stay here forever.

He arrived at a connecting point between the Immortal Realm and Netherworld. There were still battles ongoing here, and countless lower-level cultivators were fighting here, contending over great opportunities.

Ling Han’s figure descended, and it just so happened that the cultivators of the Immortal Realm and Netherworld were fighting fiercely for a Godly medicine. His appearance also immediately drew the attention of both sides. They both slowed their attacks so that he would not benefit from their conflict.

“Do not advance any further, or we will chop off your head,” a cultivator of the Immortal Realm shouted. Faced with great opportunities, he did not have the slightest bit of feeling that this was one of his countrymen.

Ling Han ignored him, and sat down in a cross-legged position instead. He stretched out both hands, one hand communing with the Immortal Realm, while the other connected to the Netherworld. With himself as core, he forcefully merged the two realms.

Boom, a heavenly tribulation immediately came resoundingly. The two realms separated was already a fact that had existed for a great many epochs. This separation had formed a kind of energy, so how could it be so easily destroyed?

In the past, it was three Heavenly Venerates that had moved, and that was how the two realms had been ripped apart, so how difficult was it?

Thankfully, the two realms had originally been one and the same. The difficulty level of merging them back as one was far lower than that of splitting them apart. Thus, while this was something that only three Heavenly Venerates moving together had achieved, Ling Han alone could reverse this feat. Of course, it was not something that was instantaneous, but would require an extensive amount of time.

Those cultivators that were battling discovered that there was something strange, and immediately shouted at Ling Han, “What are you doing!?”

Ling Han still took no heed. A monumental change was taking place in the Two Realm Battlefield. They had truly fused together, and the Regulations of heaven and earth were changing, becoming complete.

“Yi, why do I feel like I still have considerable room for improvement?”

“My foundations are actually so unstable!”

“I can be 10 times stronger than this!”

Those nearby were the earliest to benefit. The two realms joined together were the true Ancient Realm, so others could take that final step after reaching Genesis Tier, and step into the Celestial Realm. It was just like how people from a small world would come into the Ancient Realm through opening the sky. The first feeling was that they were immediately able to break through.

This kind of bizarre change immediately drew out the elites of the Two Realm Battlefield. They looked at Ling Han, and couldn’t help but feel stunned. Who exactly was this?

Furthermore, who knew what would be the end result of this kind of massive change?

“Yi, why does this guy look a little like that legendary person?” Someone recognized Ling Han. After all, Ling Han had really been too powerful and aggressive in the past.
