Chapter 2560: Tournament of Death

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Young Master, Li Long has arrived.” The Celestial King kneeled on one knee as he reported respectfully.

A young man turned around, glancing at Ling Han with a smile, and saying, “What are you standing there in a daze for? Come, take a seat.” He gestured at Ling Han, pointing to an empty seat.

Ling Han walked over and went to sit down on the empty seat.

However, just as his bottom was about to touch the seat, one of the youths suddenly lashed out.

Pa!

The seat beneath him instantly exploded into smithereens. At the same time, an overwhelming force pressed down, trying to push Ling Han to the ground.

The person who had lashed out had three iridescent ribbons around him, signifying his status as a Third Heaven Celestial King.

Was he trying to establish dominance?

Ling Han sat down as if there were truly a seat beneath him. Meanwhile, he easily dispersed the force that the Celestial King had unleashed.

He then casually retrieved a chair from his Spatial Celestial Tool and put it beneath himself.

“Is this how Young Master Tang welcomes his guests?” Ling Han said with a smile. “He’s so poor that the guests need to prepare their own chairs?”

“Hahahaha!” Tang Yuan immediately roared with laughter. He looked at the Celestial King who had lashed out, and said, “See, Luo Yang, this is a prodigy from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Powerful just as expected, right?”

The Celestial King called Luo Yang simply shrugged and smiled. He hadn’t unleashed his full strength just then, and he was confident that he could definitely defeat Ling Han if he used his full strength.

These wealthy second generations had all been born and raised in this place. Thus, they naturally didn’t think much of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

“He’s decently powerful,” he replied.

“This young master especially appreciates young prodigies.” Tang Yuan pointed at himself, and continued, “I’ll give you an opportunity. Become my follower, and I can guarantee that you can do as you please in Ghost King City. No one will dare to touch a single hair of yours!”

“Hurry up and thank Young Master Tang!” the youths who were enjoying the performances immediately said to Ling Han.

Ling Han indeed wanted to keep a low profile. However, he definitely wouldn’t resign himself to becoming someone else’s dog. He smiled faintly, and replied, “Thank you for your appreciation, Young Master Tang. However, I’m accustomed to being by myself, so forgive me if I want to keep things this way.”

Luo Yang stood up, and exclaimed, “Li Long!” There was a cold smile on his face, and he said, “Don’t be an ungrateful wretch! You think this is still the World’s Paramount Martial Academy? You think you’re still a revered prodigy?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His words were dripping with jealousy.

Even though they were all young masters and whatnot, at the end of the day, were they not all prisoners? They could only act as wanton rulers of this small place; they could only be frogs at the bottom of a well.

Moreover, they had no other choice. They hadn’t been locked here because they had committed some atrocious crime, but they had instead been locked here because their parents were prisoners in this place. They had been born with a stain to their name. They would be trapped here for eternity.

Thus, they acted in flagrant and wanton manners, using such methods to express their dissatisfaction and vexation. Moreover, they were all extremely jealous of outsiders. This was because they at least had a choice.

Ling Han remained calmly seated, saying, “Are you trying to lecture me?”

“You’re asking for a beating!” Luo Yang immediately lashed out at Ling Han.

“I let things slip the first time, but that doesn’t mean I’m a pushover!” Ling Han said in a baleful voice. He clenched his fists and unleashed a punch at Luo Yang.

Peng!

Their fists collided, and Luo Yang instantly moaned in pain as he was sent flying. He slammed into a decorative rock, smashing it into smithereens. Only then did he come to a stop.

Ling Han was astonished. This wasn’t because he hadn’t smashed Luo Yang to bits. He had suppressed some of his strength, and he was very clear about this. Instead, he was astonished because Luo Yang had come to a stop after only breaking a single rock.

By his estimation, Luo Yang should have shot through half of the city.

This rock was extremely tough.

“Hahahaha! Sure enough, you’re extremely powerful,” Tang Yuan said with applause. “You sent Luo Yang flying with a single punch. You can definitely rank inside the top 10 among Third Heaven Celestial Kings.”

The other young Celestial Kings were all stunned into silence.

Meanwhile, Luo Yang picked himself with great struggle and difficulty, sheer disbelief on his face. Initially, he hadn’t believed that people from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy would be that much more powerful. However, even though they were at the same cultivation level, he had been sent flying with a single punch. The gulf between them was as clear as could be.

However, Luo Yang more so felt a sense of resentment. He had actually been humiliated before so many people! If it weren’t for Tang Yuan not commanding him to, he would have definitely called for reinforcements to kill Ling Han on the spot!

In any case, it was extremely normal for Celestial Kings to die in this place.

Tang Yuan stopped his applause, saying, “Taking into account your strength, I can permit you not to become a dog. How about this, fight in the Tournament of Death for me. As long as you win the title of Blood Martial King, I’ll bestow you with an Ascending Dragon Pill.”

“Young Master Tang!” the other youths exclaimed in astonishment and jealousy. They involuntarily stood up.

Ling Han was also surprised. Was this Ascending Dragon Pill extremely freakish? Why were the youths all acting so shocked?

“You don’t know what the Ascending Dragon Pill is?” one of the young Celestial Kings asked as he glanced at Ling Han. “The Ascending Dragon Pill can increase our chance of advancing to the next level. Moreover, its effects can be stacked to reach a maximum of 10 percent.”

10 percent.

Even though this didn’t look like much, each step forward in the Celestial King Tier was as difficult as ascending the heavens. To the majority of Celestial Kings, they would be trapped at a certain cultivation level for all of their lives. For example, the Fourth Heaven or the Seventh Heaven.

Thus, to say nothing of a 10 percent increase in chance of breaking through, even a 1 percent increase or a 0.1 percent increase would be incredibly valuable. People would fight tooth and nail for such a pill.

It was no wonder that the youths all stood up in shock upon hearing this.

Ling Han also came to a realization. No wonder these people could reach the Second Heaven or Third Heaven even though they possessed such mediocre aptitudes. They had most likely advanced thanks to Ascending Dragon Pills.

However, this Ascending Dragon Pill was far too freakish. It actually had such astonishing effects.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “What’s this about the Tournament of Death?”

“This is naturally a place for battle. Moreover, only by winning 10 battles in a row can one acquire the title of Blood Martial King,” a Celestial King explained. “However, don’t be mistaken in thinking that this is easy to achieve. On average, such a person only appears once every 100 years.

“Moreover…” The Celestial King paused as if purposefully trying to frighten Ling Han. “The fatality rate in the Tournament of Death is 40 percent!”

Ling Han cracked a grin, saying, “Sounds interesting. Count me in.”

He had come here to do battle, so this Tournament of Death was most likely his best choice.

The young Celestial Kings were all astounded. They had already explained the grave dangers of the Tournament of Death, yet this person had still decided to join without a shred of hesitation. Just how confident was he?

Tang Yuan clapped his hands and roared with laughter. “Very well! Very well! I wasn’t mistaken in inviting you, Li Long. If you can obtain the title of Blood Martial King, I definitely won’t treat you poorly!”

Ling Han simply replied with a faint smile. He naturally wouldn’t pay much attention to this second-generation young master.

“Come, let’s drink!” Tang Yuan said in delight. He clinked glasses with the others, and it wasn’t long before he became slightly drunk.

This alcohol was extremely potent, so much so that even Ling Han could barely withstand it with his strength. This was to say nothing of ordinary Celestial Kings.

Tang Yuan was extremely keen, and he immediately made arrangements for Ling Han, marking down a battle in three days’ time.

Ling Han also learned more about the Tournament of Death.
