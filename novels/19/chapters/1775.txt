Chapter 1776: Stealing

“Is it really alright to pick on people like this? Aren’t you afraid that you’ll give birth to a son with no a*shole?” a voice that was filled with disdain suddenly said. Everyone looked over, only to see a beautiful young woman walking out from the crowd.

This was none other than Situ Xiaozhen. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In fact, one could already determine the owner of this voice without looking over. After all, few women spoke as boldly as this.

“Lady Xiaozhen!” everyone immediately said in greeting upon seeing Situ Xiaozhen.

Situ Xiaozhen was only at the first severance, yet her grandpa was a mighty three-star alchemist. Thus, this instantly elevated her status by several notches.

Even the clan leader of the Fu Clan would have to treat a three-star alchemist with respect.

It could be said that only Situ Xiaozhen could pick on others, and no one else could pick on her. Otherwise, they would be seeking death.

Thus, her interference instantly caused Fu Siyuan to frown.

This was a mini ancestor!

“Little girl, why have you run over here?” Fu Siyuan asked with a chuckle. Although he was adopting the position of an elder, he was speaking politely and acting as friendly as he could.

“Do you have the right to call me little girl?” Situ Xiaozhen said with a sneer. “Old geezer, why don’t you take a piss and look at your own reflection. Your face is crooked and repulsive, so stop trying to act all friendly with me. I’m not familiar with you at all.”

Fu Siyuan instantly exploded with rage. He had heard about Situ Xiaozhen’s “evil reputation” before, yet only after encountering her did he finally realize just how toxic her tongue truly was.

However, he didn’t dare to unleash his fury.

After all, who didn’t know that she was Situ Tang’s only granddaughter? If anyone dared to pick on her, regardless of whether they were in the right or not, that old man would definitely rush over to personally battle with them.

Moreover, it didn’t matter how powerful he was. Facing a three-star alchemist, who dared to touch even a single hair of his?

If anyone dared to attack him, the clan leader and the Fu Clan would definitely rush over to personally punish them!

“Why, you little girl!” Fu Siyuan said with a forced smile. He waved his hand, and continued, “Alright, enough with the nonsense. This is a fair and evenly matched battle.”

“Fair? Heh, fair?!” Situ Xiaozhen said with a cold sneer. Although her tongue was toxic, she was someone who had an overwhelming sense of justice and righteousness. Thus, she would directly speak her mind if she came across anything unjust. She would never hide her emotions.

“Ling Han, follow me!” she said. “Let me see who dares to target you.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel exasperated. He was a huge fan of Situ Xiaozhen’s sense of justice and righteousness. However, he still wanted to consume that water dragon! Yet, his battle with Fu Zhengtong had been forcefully interrupted by her. What could he do now?

“There’s no need. This is a simple sparring match,” he said with a wave of his hand. The Xuanyin Source Water was releasing an increasingly powerful urge to consume the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water. This was his Source Power, so in a sense, it also represented the desires of his own body.

Situ Xiaozhen faltered upon hearing this, and she said, “You stupid fool, that’s the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water! Moreover, it’s already developed intelligence! Did you think it was just an ordinary celestial treasure?”

‘Nonsense. I only want to consume it because it’s the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water!’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’ve never seen such a matter before, so I want to experience its power.”

“You dumb c*nt!” Situ Xiaozhen said as she flipped the bird at Ling Han. “So be it, do whatever you want. I can’t be bothered anymore.”

After saying this, she ran away in frustration.

Everyone was puzzled upon seeing this. Ling Han had the support of Situ Xiaozhen, so why didn’t he seize the opportunity to decline the battle?

Perhaps he was truly a fool?

Even Fu Siyuan was slightly confused upon seeing this. He refused to believe that a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator could be so stupid. However, no matter how he wracked his brains, he still couldn’t figure out how Ling Han would possibly rival the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water.

‘Perhaps he possesses powerful spiritual matters such as the Yaksha Fire or Sixth Heaven Thunder?

‘No way! What a joke!’

Fu Siyuan pondered for a moment before deciding not to stop Ling Han.

They definitely had to win their face back. Otherwise, their branch would suffer great humiliation.

Fu Zhengtong roared loudly before charging at Ling Han. He couldn’t suppress his anger any longer.

Boom!

The water dragon howled in fury. This was a spiritual matter of heaven and earth, and when it grew up, it could even reach the Ascending Origin Tier. Although it was wounded now, it still possessed the might of a Dividing Soul Tier elite. Moreover, it possessed the Great Dao of Water that one could investigate and comprehend. As such, this was definitely a paramount treasure.

However, it was a shame that it was only at the Dividing Soul Tier, meaning that one couldn’t rely on it to comprehend the mystical nature of the Immortal Palace Tier. Otherwise, it would be even more valuable.

On the flip side, however, Fu Zhengtong wouldn’t have been able to borrow this treasure if it had been truly flawless and able to reach the Ascending Origin Tier. After all, such a powerful treasure would definitely attract Ascending Origin Tier forces who might even try to forcefully steal it.

The water dragon was unstoppable as it swooped over.

Ling Han dashed aside to dodge, and he started to engage in battle with Fu Zhengtong. However, the water dragon was far too powerful. After all, it was at the Dividing Soul Tier, and it was perhaps even above the yang soul. It had potentially reached the yin soul or even the earth soul. Thus, it was inevitable that Ling Han was occasionally struck by the water dragon.

Shockingly, however, it was as if Ling Han weren’t affected by this at all. He remained calm and composed regardless of how the water dragon wreaked havoc in his surroundings. It was as if the water dragon weren’t a Dividing Soul Tier elite, but rather a measly Genesis Tier cultivator.

Gasp!

Everyone was transfixed with shock and disbelief. How could they accept this?

Meanwhile, Ling Han was secretly feeling elated. Each time he clashed with the water dragon, he would pluck a wisp of its power of Regulations, transforming this into his own power. During this process, his Origin Power would continue to rise at a steady rate.

To celestials, the accumulation of Origin Power was already relatively unimportant. However, this was still something that needed to be accumulated over time. As such, why would Ling Han not accept this free Origin Power?

Of course, his most important task was still to strengthen his Source Power. If Ling Han wanted to comprehend the power of Regulations, he could use his own Source Power to comprehend the Regulations of Water and the Regulations of Fire. After all, both of these Source Powers were already at the Celestial King Tier.

Would the difficulty of comprehending heaven and earth be equivalent to the difficulty of comprehending one’s own power and body?

Thus, it could be said that before reaching the Celestial King Tier, Ling Han’s cultivation speed would be tens of thousands of times quicker than that of other cultivators!

This was inevitable. After all, who else would be fortunate enough to refine a Source Power of heaven and earth?

Even when considering Celestial Kings, few could achieve such a feat!

‘Incredible! This feels absolutely incredible!’

As they collided, Ling Han continued to extract the water dragon’s power. It appeared as if they were engaged in an intense battle, yet in reality, the water dragon was continuously becoming weaker.

If the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water had truly developed intelligence, it definitely wouldn’t have battled against Ling Han head-on like it was doing now. After all, would it be that foolish? Unfortunately, however, it had been captured by the ancestor while it was at the most critical moment of developing intelligence. That being the case, it could only foolishly battle against Ling Han.

It continued to weaken, and Ling Han continued to feel elated. He was brimming with Origin Power.

In fact, if he didn’t advance, his Dantian would be too small to contain any more heavenly bodies and any more Origin Power.

“Stop!” Fu Siyuan suddenly shouted. His brows knitted into a frown, and he said to Fu Zhengtong, “Attack me with your full power.”

Fu Zhengtong faltered upon hearing this, yet he immediately came to his senses.

Indeed, something seemed off! How could the Southern Cup Rock Sun Water be so weak? It couldn’t even suppress a measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivator?

He brandished the water dragon and attacked Fu Siyuan with his full power.

Boom!

The water dragon radiated with a powerful might as it gathered the water particles of heaven and earth. However, Fu Siyuan was astonished as he blocked this attack. Although the water dragon’s attack appeared powerful, in reality, its destructive power was only at the early stage of the fourth severance.

He came to a “sudden realization”. No wonder Ling Han could rival the power of this water dragon. As it turned out, this was a fake water dragon!

“...” Southern Cup Rock Sun Water.
