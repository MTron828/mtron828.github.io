3119 Audition

“The Ancient Formation… has been repaired?” Nie Huayun asked.

“Then what does Sect Master mean by an audition?” Gu Tang asked. Actually, he was the least bothered by this matter. He didn’t have any children, and what he liked the most was money and beautiful women.

Therefore, as long as he could ensure that there would be no change to his lifestyle, he didn’t mind who the Dao Child was.

Sun Jianfang said, “Since we’re choosing the Dao Child of Ancient Dao Sect, any one who is of age can participate. After entering the Ancient Formation, whoever can walk out first will be the candidate for the Dao Child.”

“Sect Master, may I ask what this Ancient Formation is like?” Tan Jing asked expectantly.

If possible, he naturally wanted his grandson to become the Dao Child. He only supported Li Changdan because he knew that his grandson couldn’t compare to Li Changdan, and he himself had received benefits from He Guan.

But now, he was filled with anticipation.

“There will be all kinds of tests in the Ancient Formation,” said Sun Jianfang. “Most importantly, if two people fight, the formation will adjust the cultivation level of both sides to ensure it will be a fair battle.”

“Eh, it actually has such an effect?” The elders were all shocked.

Sun Jianfang nodded. “However, I don’t know whether it was the Ancient Formation not being completely repaired or if it was naturally like this… but it can’t adjust the cultivation of both sides to be exactly the same.

“If it’s just a difference of a single Meridian, there won’t be any adjustments from the formation. If the difference exceeds one meridian, it will suppress the one with a higher cultivation level to the point of just slightly exceeding the gap of one meridian.”

The elders all nodded. This way, they would be able to fight fairly.

On the other hand, a prodigy could also stand out. For example, Li Changdan had always been invincible among his peers. Even if he encountered opponents who were stronger than him by one meridian, he would remain undefeated.

However, the suppression of a Ten Meridians on a Nine Meridians was too great. Right now, Li Changdan could only be invincible among his peers. He was unable to contend against one of Ten Meridians.

However, if the opponent was dropped to Nine Meridians, then Li Changdan would still be the same Li Changdan from before. In this ancient formation, his battle prowess would definitely be number one. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He Guan immediately nodded, and said, “Alright, Sect Master’s suggestion is really good. Anyone can participate in the audition. The one who stands out is undoubtedly the Dao Child. No one can say anything further.”

“Yes.” Qi Feng and the others nodded. This was indeed relatively fair, but with Li Changdan’s strength, who else could compete with him?

To be honest, even if they entered the ancient formation, they might not be a match for Li Changdan.

“Then it’s decided,” Sun Jianfang said indifferently. “The time is set to be 10 days later.”

…

Audition for selecting the Dao Child!

How would he be selected?

Everyone went to understand the situation, and then shook their head. Under such rules, who could compete with Li Changdan?

Of course, there was also a portion of people looking forward to it. This was because the ancient formation wasn’t as simple as just a battle. It also depended on luck. Perhaps if one had a burst of luck, they would be the first to run out of the formation without even having to fight.

Everyone was making preparations. There were still 10 days left, so they naturally had to make proper preparations.

When Ling Han heard of this, he was also slightly surprised. This was because Sun Jianfang had previously said that he would be given three years to advance to Twelve Meridians. At that time, he would be appointed as the Dao Child. Why did things suddenly change?

However, within the formation, his cultivation level would be suppressed. If there was only a difference of one meridian, Ling Han believed that he would still be able to defeat all his opponents.

However, the question was, why was selection of the Dao Child being moved ahead of schedule?

Someone was causing trouble?

At first, Ling Han didn’t manage to guess the reason behind this, but within two days, there was news that Li Changdan and He Miaoyin were getting engaged, and the time… was on the day after the audition for Dao Child.

So that was the case. He Guan took the initiative, and gave the other elders some benefits so that they could form an alliance to force Sun Jianfang’s hand. Then, Sun Jianfang would have no choice but to accede.

Well, it was Li Changdan again.

Ling Han rubbed his chin. Actually, he didn’t really care about the status of the Dao Child. He believed in himself; this wasn’t something that could be decided by whether he was given the identity of the Dao Child or not.

However, Li Changdan’s tricks made Ling Han extremely displeased.

So he wanted to bully him?

Since Li Changdan cared so much about the status of the Dao Child, Ling Han had to take it all the more.

‘Li Changdan?

‘Alright, let’s meet this Ancient Dao Sect’s number one prodigy.’

Ling Han used these 10 days to either cultivate or practice the Demonic Monkey Fists every day. This set of fist techniques was truly vast and profound, as if it was enough for him to use the rest of his life to figure it out.

10 days later.

All the youngsters of the Ancient Dao Sect arrived in front of the great formation. At the foot of the mountain, there were paddy fields, forests, and a stretch of river.

“Who do you guys think will obtain the position of Dao Child?”

“Tsk, is there a need to guess? It must be Senior Brother Li.”

“That’s right. Not only is Senior Brother Li of Nine Meridians, he’s also invincible among his peers. No matter what, I think it’s impossible for him to meet his match.”

“What a joke. Senior Brother Li is invincible in a battle of the same level, okay? Besides, Nie Yang and Tu Luo haven’t even entered the Nine Meridians. How can they be a match for Senior Brother Li when there’s a difference of one Meridian?”

“Exactly.”

The public opinion was basically leaning towards Li Changdan. After all, he had been a top prodigy of the Ancient Dao Sect ever since he started cultivating. Now that he had the advantage in cultivation level, he definitely had a high chance of winning.

“Li Changdan is here!” someone shouted.

In the distance, Li Changdan strode over, accompanied by a delicate beauty. It was He Miaoyin, who had just celebrated her 18th birthday.

Li Changdan was dressed in a green martial arts attire, completely revealing his slender and muscular figure. Coupled with his gentle and refined appearance, he was truly elegant and graceful, causing many female disciples to squeal involuntarily.

He Miaoyin’s face was filled with pride. This incomparably outstanding man would soon become her fiancé, as well as the Ancient Dao Sect’s Dao Child and future sect master.

‘These women, humph, you’re only worthy of being jealous of me.’

A faint smile was seen on Li Changdan’s face. No one could guess what he was thinking.

“Looks like the rumors are true. Senior Brother Li is really going to get engaged to Junior Sister He.”

“Sigh, I’m so envious of Senior Brother Li. Junior Sister He is so beautiful, and she’s also Elder He’s granddaughter.”

“Nonsense, it’s clearly He Miaoyin who’s out of his league. Senior Brother Li is so handsome, so elegant, and so promising.”

The men were jealous of Li Changdan, while the women were envious of He Miaoyin. Some of them even started fighting. Few people noticed that Ling Han had also walked over from another direction.

He glanced at Li Changdan, and a knowing smile appeared on his face.

Actually, he understood Li Changdan better than anyone else.

Such a person, who called himself a prodigy, actually thought that He Miaoyin was not worthy of him. However, for his future, he had to make some sacrifices.

Otherwise, how could he have such an expression when his beloved was right beside him?
