1548 A Demon Master“s daughter

Their creditor was here!

Ling Han and Gou Li exchanged looks, and planned to slip away.

“Fairy Zhu, have these two people offended you?” a big shot asked. Though he was only in the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, because he was a king tier, his battle prowess could be claimed to be extraordinary, and he could lay claim to the name of a big shot.

His name was Bei Kai, and he did not belong to this galaxy.

“Fairy Zhu, I will get revenge for you!”

“Let me!”

There were a considerable number of people calling out in the area, all of them seeming to be close friends of this young girl.

A muscle twitched slightly in Ling Han’s cheek, and he asked Gou Li, “Hey, hey, hey, whose chicken did you actually steal? This girl’s background does not look to be very ordinary!”

“How should I know? I immediately made a move when I saw the Green Treasure Chicken,” Gou Li said very innocently.

“You, the two of you actually stole Fairy Zhu’s Green Treasure Chicken?” Someone beside them heard their words, and was immediately scared into taking a few steps back, as if determined to draw a clear dividing line between them.

Ling Han was confused, and asked, “So what if he stole it? Who exactly is this girl?”

“That’s right, who is she?” Gou Li asked.

Another person by the side shook his head, and asked, “You two actually don’t even know of Fairy Zhu, Zhu Xuan?”

“Is she very famous?” Gou Li murmured, and then his eyes suddenly became blank. “Hiss, I remember the Overlord Sword Demon Master’s surname is also Zhu, don’t tell me...”

“That’s right, Fairy Zhu is precisely the only daughter of the Overlord Sword Demon Master.” The man nodded.

‘F*ck!’

Gou Li’s eyes involuntarily widened. He actually stole a chicken from the daughter of a Demon Master; wasn’t that practically issuing a challenge to the Demon Master?

Ling Han grinned, and clapped a hand on Gou Li’s shoulder. “Congratulations, you are about to be hunted down by a Demon Master.”

“Get lost, aren’t you the same as well? Don’t forget, you also had a share of the chicken meat!” Gou Li jumped high into the air.

With their explanation, those gathered also understood. No wonder Zhu Xuan was so furious. As it turned out, these two had been so outrageously bold to actually steal and eat the chickens that she was raising.

Everyone shook their heads. She was the daughter of a Demon Master. If you drew her ire, you had best pray for good luck. However, in any case, they had just stolen and ate a few chickens, so they simply had to offer a humble apology. Fairy Zhu was not a petty person.

“Humph, kneel down and quickly apologize to Fairy Zhu!” A young man stood up.

Initially, Zhu Xuan was noble and remote. Even if others wanted to curry her favor, they would not get the chance to. But this was a wonderful chance. If he could perform well in front of Zhu Xuan, who knew, she might fall in love with him, right? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Then wouldn’t he become the son-in-law of a Demon Master?

This was a great opportunity!

“None of your business, get lost!” Gou Li was not in a good mood, and waved off the man, appearing to be very irritated.

“Humph, you are really arrogant, no wonder you dared to steal from Fairy Zhu!” The man moved brazenly and took the initiative to attack Gou Li.

He dared to step out, so he indeed had some abilities. His strength was not inferior to Gou Li, so this wouldn’t only be seeking his own humiliation.

The two people fought fiercely, yet it was hard to decide who was stronger. They continued to be stuck in a stalemate.

Bei Kai saw a sliver of impatience in Zhu Xuan’s expression, and thus said, “Fairy Zhu, allow me to fight on your behalf, and give these two little thieves a little punishment.”

Zhu Xuan nodded, not taking Bei Kai’s move to ingratiate himself with her to heart. Because she was the daughter of a Demon Master, she was used to others currying favor with her all her life. Because she was not accustomed to it, she chose to live on her own. She had not thought that she had just moved out a few years, yet she would already be robbed.

Her Green Treasure Chickens were too pitiful. In the past, even her old man drooled at the sight of them, but because she had developed affection for them, she did not allow the Demon Master to take a single bite. But in the end, they ended up in the stomachs of two little thieves.

Bei Kai moved, suppressing with a single palm strike. Both Gou Li and his opponent paled in shock, and hurriedly separated, not daring to face this attack head-on.

A king tier that had reached the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier could be called a big shot; his battle prowess was incredibly frightening.

His eyes focused on Gou Li, and he attacked continuously. Because Gou Li’s abilities were clearly superior to Ling Han’s, as long as Gou Li was suppressed, Ling Han naturally would have no escape, either.

Gou Li roared out in anger. He, too, was a king tier, so he naturally was unwilling to be captured and humiliated. He showed his full battle prowess, and fought Bei Kai right up to the skies. But no matter how powerful he was, there was a gap of a whole minor level between the two of them. He was definitely no match for Bei Kai.

In merely over a dozen moves, he was blasted down from the skies by a palm strike. Bang, he crashed into the platform on the mountain top, and created a human-shaped pit in the platform.

Ling Han walked over with a smile, and said, “Chicken thief, you really don’t look so good now.”

“Filth King, don’t you laugh now. Later, you’ll be following in my footsteps.” Gou Li’s physique was very strong; he actually still had the energy to speak, but his vitality had indeed greatly declined, and he appeared to be a bit weak and lacking strength.

“It’s your turn!” Bei Kai stood proudly in midair, pointing a finger right at Ling Han.

Ling Han crooked his finger at him. “I should give you prior warning. Later, if I thrash you, you had better not break out in tears.”

“Ha!” Bei Kai smirked coldly, a hint of displeasure leaking into his expression. He especially despised those who liked to talk big. He did not say anything else, and stretched out his hand to grab Ling Han. In his opinion, he would naturally be easily grabbed with a single move.

Ling Han used his index and middle fingers like a sword, and swiped out at that giant hand.

Weng, under the pressure of a big shot, Ling Han suddenly looked strained. However, even if the other was a big shot, the peak stage of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier was still a little inferior, and was not enough to shake his physique.

The palm strike landed, and Bei Kai couldn’t help but lightly exclaim in surprise. Though he had not used his full power in this strike, the other party had dispersed it a little too easily, hadn’t he?

The others were also surprised. Bei Kai actually did not manage to apprehend Ling Han in a single move. This was extremely inconceivable. It should be known that Bei Kai was known as a big shot.

Yet Ling Han shook his head internally. Bei Kai was indeed not weak, but compared to the big shots of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, he was lacking. At most, he could only be considered a rank one king tier. Apparently, in different places, what the moniker of big shot represented was also vastly different.

WIth a battle cry, he took the initiative to approach Bei Kai, and began a furious battle with the latter.

This was an acceptable opponent. Compared to the man previously, he was considerably stronger, and could allow him to acquire a better grasp of the Regulations of the Netherworld. He was studying for practical application. His cultivation level was already there, and he also had the support of the Demonic Power Source, so there was no problem at all.

At the beginning, it was naturally Bei Kai who was completely suppressing Ling Han, and Ling Han could only manage to parry his attacks. In fact, he was being beaten repeatedly. However, because his physique was too strong, these attacks were completely superficial when they landed on him.

However, Ling Han gradually became capable of fighting back.

At first, he could only counterattack once per 100 moves, then he could counterattack once per 90-odd moves, and then it became 80-odd moves. The speed at which he improved was astonishing, and everyone could tell that with a single look.

This freak!

Even the big shots were emotionally stirred. This natural talent was definitely nature-defying.

Bei Kai was both shocked and embarrassed. He had not thought that Ling Han’s toughness and flexibility would be so strong. He was really getting stronger the more he was attacked. However, he was an honorable big shot, and yet he actually could not manage to apprehend a piece of trash who was only in the low extreme. How would he be able to face others in future?

He humphed coldly, and finally delivered a fatal move. His hands formed seals, and he raised them high like a treasure bottle, pressing them down on Ling Han.

“Life and death are both my decision, Treasure Bottle Seal!” he called out harshly, blazing light surging from his whole body.
