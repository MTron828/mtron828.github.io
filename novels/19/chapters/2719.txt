2720 Battling He Yufeng again

Everyone was surprised. Could it be that He Yufeng recognized this person? Otherwise, why would he say such a thing?

Ling Han smiled lightly. “He Yufeng, do you dare to battle?”

Pu!

Instantly, many people actually choked. How dared a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King challenge a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

!!

He had to have gone insane.

Nong Gaolin, Wu Yuanqing, and others all shook their heads. It was no wonder that Ling Han was so arrogant just now. This brat even dared to challenge a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; so what even if he had shown them such an attitude? Moreover, they were also absolutely speechless; they were thinking how to provoke Ling Han to accept a challenge, but in the end, he didn’t need any provocation at all, and directly took the initiative to issue a challenge.

He Yufeng snorted. “Ling Han, don’t think that just because you’re ranked number one on the recent leaderboard, you can look down on a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. That’s because you were simply lucky.”

What, so he was Ling Han!

Everyone was shocked. Since the update of the recent leaderboard, Ling Han’s name was being talked about all the time. It was just that he was too low-key up until now, so few people had seen him or known any details regarding him.

People like Lou Tianqian and the others were even more shocked. The Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings did not know; they had never been on the list themselves, so they naturally had no idea how difficult it would be to get onto the list. However, who among Lou Tianqian or the other Pseudo Heavenly Venerates hadn’t given their all to make it to the list? It was just that by looking at the results recorded on the ring, there had always been such a long way to go for them to make it onto the list.

But a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had crushed them. Before, they were already quite upset when they had yet to meet the person, and now, thinking about Ling Han’s arrogance, it naturally made them even more resentful.

…You were being so arrogant, and that was because of your ranking first on the recent leaderboard?

Damn, you were nothing more than a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King, just a lucky bastard who had gotten a bit of a head start. Did you really consider yourself as some kind of big shot?

Ling Han smiled. “Cut the crap, I’m asking if you dare to battle!”

Everyone frowned. This brat was too arrogant; how could he be so proud?

Lou Tianqian was speechless. He was already a condescending person himself, but compared with Ling Han, he was still considered to be a minor case.

“You are no more than a Ninth Heaven, I won’t bother to bully you!” He Yufeng said dully.

“Are you afraid of losing?” Ling Han said laughingly.

He Yufeng’s expression changed, revealing an angry look.

To be honest, he was indeed a little worried. Back when Ling Han was at the Seventh Heaven, he was already capable of causing him injury. Even though the other party had gone all out to launch a powerful attack which had slightly wounded him, and the other party actually sustained more serious injuries from the recoil of the attack, now that Ling Han had advanced to the Ninth Heaven, how much had his strength improved?

Even if the other party couldn’t defeat him, if he himself couldn’t easily get rid of the other party, then it would also be a big blow to his own prestige.

But being so provoked by Ling Han, could he still decline to battle?

…How could a dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate not dare to accept the challenge of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? This time, the refusal was due to his disdain, but he was being challenged again. If he still didn’t do something about it, he would be laughed at.

“Ling Han, you asked for it yourself!” He Yufeng said lightly, with killing intent flowing from him.

“Then, come out for a battle!” Ling Han said.

Even the Spatial God Tool could hardly withstand the battle between two Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. It might be fine for a short period of time, but it would definitely be pierced through should the duration be longer.

Ling Han took the initiative in leaving the Spatial God Tool, and leaped into the sky.

He Yufeng followed suit. With a touch of his feet, he also leaped into the sky.

After him, more and more people came out and floated up to the sky one after another to watch the battle.

Of course, none of them actually believed that Ling Han could contend against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. This ought to be a one-sided violent oppression.

“Ling Han, your advancement is indeed astonishing. It’s only been no more than 10,000,000 years, and you have already advanced to the Ninth Heaven.” He Yufeng’s eyes shone with vitality. At that time, he had really wanted to kill Ling Han, but he had been stopped by Lin Piaoxue. This had also made him see his own shortcomings.

In the past 10,000,000 million years, he was constantly fighting in bloody battles. His strength had improved by leaps and bounds.

The late stage of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier!

“However, you are not the only one who has made progress!” He released his aura without reservations, and it reverberated like a tsunami. “My strength is many times greater than before!”

“I’ll give you another head start of nine moves!” He crossed his hands behind his back.

At that time, he had failed to kill Ling Han with one move, and had been injured by Ling Han instead. This was a knot in his heart, and now he wanted to untie this knot in his heart.

This made everyone else nod in agreement. As expected of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, so impressive!

Ling Han did not show any courtesy, either. He stretched his right hand forward, balling it into a fist, and as he circulated the Five Elements Lightning Technique, pa, pa, pa, nine-colored divine lightning instantly pulsated around his fist.

He Yufeng’s expression involuntarily turned apprehensive. Although Ling Han’s punch hadn’t been thrown yet, he was already feeling the heavy pressure.

The impact of this one strike was bound to be earth-shattering.

Before he could finish the thought, Ling Han had already made his move, springing from his feet. Bang, his body shot forward immediately, transforming into a beam of light heading straight towards He Yufeng.

‘That was so fast!’

Everyone was startled. The Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings already could hardly keep up with Ling Han’s speed. Even Lou Tianqian and the others were deeply shocked. They thought to themselves, had it been any one of them in the same situation, how would they deal with it?

After thinking about it for a while, their faces became solemn. Perhaps they could only be on the defense?

Peng! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He Yufeng’s strength was far greater than that of anyone here, and his reaction was astonishingly quick. He braced himself by crossing both his hands in front of his body, and blocked this strike from Ling Han.

However, the power of this punch was too great, and it directly sent He Yufeng flying, and blazing lighting was rippling all over his body, making crackling noises.

Peng, peng, peng, He Yufeng smashed through at least 17 cloud clusters, and when he stopped, he felt severe pain on both his hands, as if his bones were broken, and his whole body was numb.

He couldn’t help feeling astonished. Why was the power of this strike so terrifying? Perhaps it had reached the level of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier?

Before he could finish his thought, he only felt such a severe pain in his chest, and when he opened his mouth, he suddenly spewed out a stream of blood.

Seeing this scene, everyone was shocked.

A single punch from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had injured a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate so seriously that he vomited blood, and this Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was actually an elite on the recent leaderboard.

“This is because He Yufeng underestimated his opponent, allowing Ling Han to build up power for an ultimate move, and restricting himself by giving the other party a head start of nine moves.”

“If He Yufeng had released an ultimate move to strike back back just now, it wouldn’t have been like this.”

“But… Ling Han’s strength is indeed beyond expectation.”

“Is he really just a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?”

Some people were quite objective, and knew that it was not that He Yufeng was outmatched, but that he was just unprepared. However, this did not mean that Ling Han’s freakishness could be disregarded at all.

Ling Han was not in a hurry to throw a second punch, but rather smilingly said, “So how about it? Do you still want to give me a head start of nine moves?”

“Humph, how can I go back on my words!” He Yufeng insisted.

“Okay.” Ling Han’s body shot forward quickly, and continued to throw another punch.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Each of his strikes was domineering. It was a Heavenly Venerate Technique, so it was naturally terrifying.

Poor He Yufeng, he could only defend, and was suddenly being continuously bombarded.

He kept retreating, and kept vomiting blood. When Ling Han blasted out the sixth punch, he could not bear it any more, and fought back. Peng, a terrifying aura spread out, and he also used a Heavenly Venerate Technique, or it would be impossible to block the attack.

Now, the two were evenly matched.

Boom, after the clash of attacks from both sides, the two retreated 150 km away from one another. Both were gazing at each other.

Ling Han just scoffed, but didn’t say anything.

He Yufeng’s face actually turned scarlet. He said he wanted to give Ling Han a head start of nine moves, but he couldn’t help fighting back at the sixth move. This was a public embarrassment for him. However, if he hadn’t fought back with all his strength, he might have been seriously injured before he could’ve reached the ninth move.
