Chapter 1514 Second Encounter

Hu Can and his group were once again calm and unruffled.

There was no hindering by the mountain winds here, so they could use their full strength. In that case, how easy would it be to suppress Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing?

They were merely easy prey.

“Fairy, why do you have to follow this kind of trash? Just join our Eight Stones Forbidden Land,” Hu Can said to Empress Luan Xing.

Ordinarily, it was extremely difficult to enter into a certain Forbidden Land. To maintain the purity of the bloodline of their Eight Stones Tribe, they only chose their spouses from within the clan. As long as they weren’t actual siblings, marriage was possible among cousins.

But with how astonishingly beautiful Empress Luan Xing was, he naturally had to put all his efforts to strive for her. Worse come to worst, they could choose not to have children.

These words were said right in front of Ling Han. Actually, he was deliberately delivering a blow against Ling Han. Who asked them to experience so many losses previously? If he didn’t deliver a flew blows to this person, it truly would not be enough to vent his ire.

Empress Luan Xing didn’t even look at Hu Can. Wasn’t that mere nonsense coming from a fool? She didn’t even want to bother with him. Ugly people would do all kinds of things to get attention.

This was the Empress’s style of contempt, causing Hu Can and the other men to feel displeased internally.

“Let me beat him to death!” Hu Bing was the first to jump out. He had always felt defiant, thinking that the only reason he had not been a match for Ling Han previously was due to the mountain winds.

Yet Hu Can stretched out an arm and pulled him back. He shook his head.

Hu Bing was definitely not a match for this brat. It was very simple. He had used half of his power, and was still unable to take Ling Han down. Was Hu Bing half as strong as he was? What a joke, he was not even as strong as a ten-thousandth of him.

They had already lost three consecutive rounds. How could they continue to seek their own humiliation?

“Brother Can!” Hu Bing was defiant. He was a prodigy that had walked out from a Forbidden Land. What person of the same cultivation level in the Immortal Realm could put up a fight against him?

Hu Can shot a glare at him, and Hu Bing immediately dared not say anything else.

“How should I address you?” Hu Can asked.

Ling Han quirked his lips in a grin, and replied, “You guys want to kill me, so I don’t have to be reserved, either, and will just kill you all. Hence, you all will soon become a pile of corpses; what use is there for you to know my name?”

“So arrogant!” Hu Can smirked coldly. This was a battle of seven against two, and they had the advantage in numbers. Furthermore, Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing were both only in the low extreme. The gap in cultivation level was like the gap between heaven and earth. Where did you get all this confidence from?

“Whether I’m arrogant or not, you will only know the answer after a battle!” Ling Han’s fists trembled.

“Charge!” Hu Can shot out. Channeling the Eight Stones Body Art, his body turned into a massive rock figure that could not be harmed by any weapon or affected by any technique. As he had attained the second level of the Eight Stones Technique, he should be invincible among his peers in the Eternal River Tier. Unless his foe was in the pinnacle level, they would not be able to hurt him.

If it was not because there was power of Regulation of Genesis Tier in the mountain winds, how could he have lost to them?

Ling Han drew out the broken wooden sword. Before the grade of the Divine Demon Sword was raised, it was still the broken wooden sword that was more useful. Otherwise, if he used the Divine Demon Sword against an elite in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, it would definitely shatter with a single strike.

Before he entered into the Celestial Realm, the might of the broken wooden sword was actually not inferior to the Divine Demon Sword’s. One after another, demonic patterns appeared, and a frightening killing intent surged forth.

“Saint Tool!” Hu Can became apprehensive, and then shook his head. “Demonic Tool!”

A look of envy appeared on his face—even he did not have a corresponding Saint Tool.

Even though the Forbidden Lands had astonishing wealth, there was a large number of them; they had expanded too much because they had come with their whole families.

Just look at the Stone Emperor. He was the only child of his old man, so whatever treasures were definitely going to be left to him. Thus, the Stone Emperor could ride a Saint-level chariot, and he also had armor made of Saintly Material that was not inferior in any respect.

As for the Forbidden Lands? Seven prodigies that were not inferior to the Stone Emperor in any way had so easily appeared, but did the Forbidden Land really have so many Saint Tools? They had not obtained the inheritance of a Celestial King. They had to have Saint Tools, and perhaps there were a good many too, but the number definitely did not reach the extent where all the juniors could each possess one.

Hu Can was naturally jealous. He was also filled with a strong wariness. That was a Saint Tool. It was nothing to joke about if he was hit even once with it. Furthermore, Ling Han was not an ordinary low extreme cultivator, either. His battle prowess could even match half of his strength, and added with a Demonic Tool, that was like doubling his power.

His expression was very solemn; drawing out the distance from Ling Han, they exchanged blows.

Ling Han waved the sword to parry the incoming attacks. His strength was much too inferior to Hu Can’s. Even if he used the 10 formations at the same time, he was still far from becoming a match for him. Thankfully, he had Tide of the Ages that could largely dispense most of the attacks, and added with his frightening physique, the damage that Hu Can could deliver to him was extremely limited.

Even if he was wounded, it would also be instant recovery with his recovery abilities, so it did no harm.

Hu Can finally let go of his pride, and declared, “Let’s attack together and kill this man!” Ling Han already knew the secret behind the Heavenly River King’s treasures, so he definitely had to be killed.

Hu Bing and the other two men immediately leaped out, ganging up on him without any hesitation. Hu Shuyu and the other women, though, targeted Empress Luan Xing, and surrounded her in a well-coordinated movement.

In the eyes of Hu Can and his group, the Empress was an unmatchable treasure, but in the eyes of Hu Shuyu and the other women, the Empress was a thorn in their side that had to be removed at all costs. Otherwise, the jealousy would drive them crazy.

Just the thought that there was actually such a perfect woman in this world made their hearts clench!

The empress was fearless, and drew out the brick.

Both sides erupted in battle. Whether it was Ling Han or Empress Luan Xing, they were both at a disadvantage.

The gap in numbers and cultivation level was too large, and the only reason why they managed to continue fighting was because one of them had a strong physique, while the other had the aid of the Absolute Beginning Stone. If it was another person, they would have long since died over a few hundred times.

But going on like this was not a good thing. Ling Han was still fine, but the Empress could only depend on the Absolute Beginning Stone, after all. If she exhausted all her Origin Power, it would be dangerous.

A ferocious light appeared in Ling Han’s eyes, and he declared, “Since you all are so determined to seek death, you cannot blame others for it!”

He endured a few heavy blows, and rushed to the side of Empress Luan Xing. He drew her into the Black Tower, and then took out the Saint’s decree. Without a second thought, he opened it directly. Boom, all of a sudden, a terrifying pressure seeped out, and boundless golden light appeared in waves.

“Oh no, it’s a Saint’s decree!” Hu Can’s expression changed drastically.

“En, the might seems to be very weak!” Hu Shuyu suddenly realized that something was off with it. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“This is the decree of a Saint, but too much time has passed, so its initial might is no longer present.”

“He must have gotten this in the main palace!”

“We’ll work together, and it would be fine if we endure for a while. The majority of power has already seeped out from the Saint’s decree.”

“Right!”

The seven of them combined forces. At this time, the decree had already exploded with a frightening killing intent, blasting towards them.

It did not even need Ling Han to actively control it. The decree would attack all other parties aside from its holder; this was also the weakness of a decree as it did not differentiate between allies and foes—if one wanted to make it so that the might of a decree could be controlled, there was a need to spend even more effort and time to forge it. At the time, it was obvious that it was impossible for the Heavenly River King to do that.

“Not good, though the power inside this decree is weak, why is the power of Regulation so frightening?” Hu Jing exclaimed in shock. It had only been a short while, and she was already covered with wounds. The situation was approaching a crisis.

“Are we really going to die here?”

“I have no wish to die!”

The seven of them exclaimed. They were filled with even more regret. If they had known that this trip would be so dangerous, they would have begged for a decree from their senior clansmen at all costs. Even if it was not written by a Saint King, it was fine as long as it had reached Saint level.

But if they really had had a Saint’s decree, Ling Han would’ve simply drawn out that drop of blood essence. Bring it on!
