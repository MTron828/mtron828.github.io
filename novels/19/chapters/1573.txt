1574 Small Tower wakes up

Gou Li was also speechless. However, being able to offend two Forbidden Lands, not missing out either the Netherworld or the Immortal Realm at that, was also a kind of capability. More importantly, Ling Han managed to enter the Netherworld alive when he had offended the Eight Stones Forbidden Land; this was even more awesome.

Hiss, this guy couldn’t have come to the Netherworld to seek refuge, right?

Gou Li thought further, and couldn’t help but feel even more stunned. You could even comprehend the Regulations of the Netherworld whilst being a f****** refugee, and merge them with the Regulations of the Immortal Realm. This was practically enough to make anyone burn with jealousy.

Meanwhile, Ouyang Taishan hummed deeply. The Eight Stones Forbidden Land was one of the most powerful forces of the Immortal Realm, especially the grand elder of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, who was both naturally talented and diligent. He definitely could be ranked among the top 10 in the Immortal Realm.

Even Ouyang Taishan did not dare be careless or overlook such a mighty figure, what more guarantee with complete confidence that the latter would definitely listen to his advice, and resolve the animosity between him and Ling Han.

“Tell me first, what enmity exists between the two of you?” he asked.

Ling Han did not conceal anything, and related the grudge between himself and the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, causing Ouyang Taishan to frown involuntarily. This was a little intractable.

“I will ask an old friend of mine from the Immortal Realm to lobby your cause, and I believe that Old Hu will look at the big picture,” Ouyang Taishan said. He had that kind of confidence because he thought that the Hu Clan’s grand elder’s longing to enter into the Celestial Realm was more important than everything else.

If they could enter into the Celestial Realm, it would mean that everyone had hopes of becoming a deity and attaining unlimited lifespan. In comparison, the deaths of a few clansmen would be a paltry matter.

Those who would have major accomplishments would not bother about the minor details.

“Young man, I will seek you out again after some time. Additionally, I will also have to pay a visit to the Tan Clan to ensure that they would behave themselves.” Ouyang Taishan nodded, and spread out a golden pathway. Grabbing Gou Li, he left.

You left just like that? Then what about me?

Ling Han couldn’t help but be speechless. Now, everyone had left, but he could not use the Black Tower. The Cloud Piercing Shuttle was also inside, so what was he to do? Travelling right across the galaxy? He indeed did not have to worry about dying of thirst or starvation, but the speed would be too slow. Even if he ran all the way to Sea Space Planet, it would take an unknown amount of time.

Forget it; he’d better just wait for Small Tower to recover.

Ling Han sat down cross-legged. He had spent the major part of these three years on comprehending formations, and had accumulated a great amount of experience, which he could sort out. This would be of great help to his learning of Saint-level formations in future.

The higher the cultivation level, the harder it would be to battle surpassing one’s cultivation level, especially for the Genesis Tier. The inhibition that a Great Saint had on a Medium Saint, and a Medium Saint had on a Small Saint was practically so huge that it was impossible to reverse.

At the bottom of things, it was mainly due to the fact that all who could reach this step were king tiers, and had cultivated to pinnacle level at some cultivation level or another before. Thus, even if there was still the difference between ranks one, two, and three, unless everyone’s cultivation level was the same, it would be extremely difficult for this kind of advantage to be reflected.

If he wanted to maintain tier-surpassing battle prowess at the Genesis Tier, then he would have to make good use of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and formations were the best weapon for him, for they would fully exploit the unique trait of sturdiness of his physique.

He sat there for 10 days and 10 nights. It was not him that wanted to end his meditation after that, but rather that Small Tower had finally woken up.

“Brat, have you gotten the Chaos Source Rock?” Small Tower asked. Its voice was very weak; it was clear that it had not fully recovered.

“Take it.” Ling Han did not tease it. It looked like Small Tower was really very seriously weakened this time round.

“Very good.” Small Tower put the Chaos Source Rock away, and then ignored Ling Han completely.

“Hey, you ungrateful stupid Small Tower, you are obviously kicking me to the curb when I’m no longer useful!” Ling Han called out, but Small Tower completely did not look like it had any intention of responding to him.

In any case, now that the Black Tower had reopened, he was not in a rush to leave. Instead, he entered into the Black Tower, and made an inventory of the gains that he had received in Ocean Dragon Mountain with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. Additionally, he also wanted to inform the two women about the Heaven Crushing Alliance.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden still did not manage to merge the Regulations of the two Realms. It was useless no matter how much time she spent underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

“The Heaven Crushing Alliance, no, all the Forbidden Lands should know how to return to the Celestial Realm, but not one person succeeded in these countless years, which clearly shows that taking this step is incredibly difficult,” Ling Han said after a moment of thought. “You and I being able to merge the Regulations of the two Realms should be a special case.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

His last words were directed at the Empress. Previously, Gu Daoyi was filled with confidence, certain that he definitely could return to the Celestial Realm. His confidence probably came from the fact that he had formed a Divine Fetus. Otherwise, what need was there for him to waste nine lifetimes in the Immortal Realm?

Could it be that he could not form the Divine Fetus of his 10th life in the Celestial Realm?

It was not that he could not, but rather that he had absolutely no way to return to the Celestial Realm in his previous nine lives.

“Are you going to agree?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I would not mind. Everyone should have the right to climb the highest peak of the path of cultivation, and no one can take that right away.”

The Empress smiled softly. In truth, she actually did not care about all life in this world; what business was it of hers? But since Ling Han said this was what he wanted, then she would use her full efforts to assist Ling Han.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, meanwhile, was very depressed. Even if she had gained the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, there was still a massive gulf existing between her and Ling Han and the Empress.

“Feng’er, come give me a kiss.” Ling Han couldn’t help but tease her when he saw her despondency.

“Go to hell!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden rolled her eyes at him.

Yet the Empress stretched over and planted a light kiss on the corner of Ling Han’s lips, as if she was comforting him.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden thought for a moment, and also came closer and kissed him. The Empress, being as enchanting as she was, was still very gentle and doted on this bad guy. If she still acted very unruly, she would probably be banished into the cold court[1].

Ling Han laughed loudly, one arm wrapped around the Empress while his other wrapped around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and planted a heavy kiss on the beautiful lips of the two women respectively. Then, he drew out the Saint Fruit and began to cook.

It could not be left uncooked. The medicinal effects of the Saintly medicine were too violent, and directly ingesting it would be a straight path to death. Even Ling Han was no exception, and cooking it in the Black Tower would allow him to draw on the power of the Black Tower to suppress it, and there would also be no waste of the slightest bit of medicinal effects.

They shared it amongst themselves, but the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden could not eat very much at all. She only drank a little soup, and immediately began refining it beneath the Reincarnation Tree. Ling Han and the Empress, meanwhile, shared the whole fruit, and divine red clouds surged from both of them. Multiple seals glowed all over their bodies, shining incredibly brightly.

They had to refine the effects as soon as possible.

Three days later, Ling Han’s and the Empress’s cultivation level advanced greatly. However, they were both in the Eternal River Tier. If they had broken through to the Genesis Tier, then wanting to improve their cultivation level by a single star would probably need more than 10 such Saintly medicines.

“The use of the Saintly medicine actually is not increasing cultivation, but there are shards of great dao within which are to be comprehended by Saints. Or those who have suffered Dao injuries would use the Saintly medicine to heal themselves,” the Empress said smilingly. “From the Genesis Tier onwards, wanting to increase cultivation basically can only depend on cultivating earnestly. In the case of Saintly medicine... that would really be too much of a waste, because you would need a huge volume.”

“A huge volume it is; I want to enter into the Celestial Realm as soon as possible,” Ling Han said. His parents, lovers, and son were all in the Celestial Realm. He had not seen them for more than 100 years, and missed them very much.

“All right, then we will snatch them over in future,” the Empress said uncaringly. As long as it was what Ling Han wanted, so what if he wanted to pierce a hole in the heavens itself?
