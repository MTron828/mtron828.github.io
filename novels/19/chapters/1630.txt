Chapter 1631: Ambush

In the distance, the Open Clouds King left on the golden path with a flutter of his sleeve.

He naturally would not be letting the matter go just like this, but this was not a good time to make a move. Then, what was the point of him continuing to stay here? Becoming a joke?

Ling Han’s left hand held the Empress’s hand, while his right hand arm was wrapped around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. He took a step forwards, and the golden path unfurled. He had already returned to Wood Figure Planet.

“Congratulations, Friend Ling!” All the Saint Kings expressed their congratulations with clasped hands. As for how many of them were truly sincere, that was something that only they themselves knew.

Though Ling Han was only a Small Saint, judging from the heavenly tribulation that he had undergone, it was clear that he possessed the battle prowess of a Great Saint. His battle prowess had even reached the middle stage or late stage of the Great Saint Tier. He was overwhelmingly strong.

Once this guy became a Medium Saint, wouldn’t he be a qualified match for a Saint King?

Added with the fact that Ling Han had already killed Saint Kings before, the Saint Kings would naturally not dare to underestimate him in the slightest. They treated him completely like he was their equal.

Ling Han thanked all the Saints, and smilingly said, “I have prepared some fine dishes and excellent wine. Please come and have a taste, everyone.”

Though a large part of the Godly medicines in the Black Tower had been destroyed, those that remained had been baptized by the purple lightning, and their effects were multiplied a hundredfold. Using them as cooking ingredients was naturally excellent. Ling Han also added some Reincarnation Tree leaves that had not been turned into ashes. This could completely be considered a Saintly medicine—if one was talking in simple terms of comprehension.

The Saints were naturally pleased. Even they could only think of having such a lavish feast; they definitely could not bear to put out such luxurious dishes.

Yet Ling Han did not feel the slightest pity. When the Reincarnation Tree sprouted and grew leaves again, its effects would definitely be improved greatly.

As for these, they would only be disposed of if he didn’t use them.

After the celebratory feast, it was time for the treasure exchange. However, the last treasure exchange had been more than a dozen years ago, so how could they produce so many treasures in such a short period of time?

The Saints’ hearts were naturally not focused on this event.

Ling Han had already become a Saint King, and the time of entry into the Celestial Realm was getting closer and closer. They had to confirm that he really would bring them and their clans into the Celestial Realm, and those with ambitions were thinking of when would be a proper time to make their move. Otherwise, when Ling Han had become a Medium Saint or a Great Saint, even Saint Kings would not be able to suppress him.

Even if the Dao seminar had concluded, these Saints did not leave, providing various reasons for their extended stay.

The ambience was a little strange. Even an idiot could feel the strangeness in the atmosphere. Perhaps there was presently a violent storm brewing.

Yet Ling Han did not care, and simply focused on stabilizing his cultivation level. Unfortunately, the Reincarnation Tree was temporarily unusable, and he could only slowly accumulate his comprehension of cultivation level with time. This caused his comprehension of cultivation level to improve very slowly, and it was unable to catch up to his Origin Power level that was already at the level of a Small Saint even after much time had passed.

There was nothing that could be done. He had already reached this level. If he could advance one step forward in 10,000 years, that would be considered quite fast. He could not ask for too much.

Thankfully, Small Tower had already said that the Reincarnation Tree would definitely recover in two years at most, and the effects would be greatly improved this time round. It would be a piece of cake for one day to be equivalent to 100 years.

And because of this, Ling Han did not use the Heavenly tribulation Fluid. It was best to be able to comprehend Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree after consuming it. Otherwise, it would be a major waste.

He did not have to rush in these two years.

On Wood Figure Planet, a storm was brewing in the dark.

There were already a few Saint Kings that were restless. With every passing day, Ling Han would become a little bit stronger, and once his power reached a critical point, even Saint Kings would not be able to do anything to him.

All the Saint Kings were sure that Ling Han had definitely obtained the inheritance of a Celestial King. Otherwise, it was definitely impossible for him to be so strong. Under the influence of such greed, a few Saint Kings were presently brewing a storm.

“The situation is not too good.” On this day, Ling Han had gathered the Empress, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, the Rain Emperor, Xu Ran, Ding Ping, and the others together. “All the Saint Kings already have their suspicions, and I have lost the trump card to kill Saint Kings. Dark waves are rippling in secret, and the storm could explode at any moment.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Rain Emperor nodded. He had already formed over 9,000,000 stars, and was close to the bottleneck point. He gruffly said, “We had best hide for a while. There is no need to get momentary satisfaction now.”

He was an absolute supporter of war. His assertiveness was no less than the Empress’, but he was definitely not a foolishly brave person. With their present strength, they were indeed far from being a match for the Saint Kings. If they went into a head-on clash, it would definitely mean their demise. There was no need for a fight to the death.

Xu Ran and the Notionless Saint also nodded in agreement. Those who would make major accomplishments should not bother with the details. This was a strategic retreat; there was nothing to be ashamed of.

Ling Han paused slightly, and then continued, “I want to use this opportunity to see who among them has malicious intentions. This kind of people... I will definitely not bring them into the Celestial Realm.”

Everyone knew that Ling Han valued relations. He had never gone back on his word once he agreed to something. When he agreed to become a core to merge the two Realms, if this process was too slow, he would directly blast open the doors into the Celestial Realm, and bring everyone with him into the Celestial Realm.

However, if someone had the intention to bring him harm while taking advantage of him to enter into the Celestial Realm at the same time, that was something that Ling Han would not allow to happen.

They all made their respective preparations. It was time for them to leave Wood Figure Planet.

Two days later, the Blue Feather Saint paid him a visit. He suggested to Ling Han that now that Ling Han had become a Saint, he should make an attempt at becoming a core, and merge the two Realms.

Ling Han considered for a moment, and then agreed to the other’s request.

In the first place, he had wanted to see how many people were having designs on him. Since the Blue Feather Saint had brought up such a request, he would go with the flow and give others a chance so that these scheming people would be revealed.

The Rain Emperor and the others were naturally long since prepared, and they all entered into the Black Tower. As for the large black dog’s group of four despicable characters, they had completely no intention of leaving. They only told Ling Han to come find them when he was ready to enter into the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han rode a golden path, and headed towards Cloud Apex Planet. This was the Two Realm Battlefield that was closest to him.

Now that he was a Saint, there was naturally no need to use the Cloud Piercing Shuttle any longer. The golden path unfurled, and his speed was overwhelming. In an instant, he had left multiple stars behind him. it was just like how he had arrived through opening the sky of the Lower Realm in the past, circulated by the heaven and earth. The speed was also as fast as this.

The speed of a Saint was the fastest speed in the Immortal Realm.

However, three golden paths actually shot over ahead of him all of a sudden. Though they did not collide with Ling Han, it could be clearly seen that along with these three golden paths, there were also three gigantic attacks.

This was Saint King Tier battle prowess, which had sealed Ling Han’s course, and at this moment, above him, below him, on his left, on his right, and behind him, three attacks shot over, and they were similarly of Saint King level.

Ling Han actually encountered the attacks of 18 Saint Kings at the same time, which had sealed all possibility of him going ahead, going backwards, or dodging in any direction.

What to do now?

Ling Han smiled calmly. He knew that he would be ambushed on the journey because he had already clearly expressed his intention to go to Cloud Apex Planet long ago.

With a thought, he disappeared, and entered into the Black Tower.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. As he disappeared, the 18 Saint King-attacks suddenly crashed into each other, forming a terrifying storm in the universe. Thankfully, there were no planets in the surrounding area, or they would definitely be destroyed.

When the storm had calmed, 18 Saint Kings appeared, all of them frowning deeply. They did not sense Ling Han’s aura. It was as if he had never even existed.
