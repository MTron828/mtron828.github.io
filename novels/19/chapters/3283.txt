Chapter 3284 - 3284: Environment of heaven and earth

Ling Han felt that this was not reliable, but he did not want to destroy the other party’s confidence, because he firmly believed that his strength would one day surpass General Vajra.

If his thoughts were known by others, they would definitely say that he was delusional. One had to know that although General Vajra wasn’t the strongest in battle prowess among the Inscription Tier, he had never tasted defeat.

Because no one could break through his defense.

However, Ling Han did not think so. If the General Vajra’s defense was invincible, he would not have submitted to the current emperor.

Therefore, there was no invincible defense. It was just a matter of whether the attack power was high enough.

“Sure.” Ling Han nodded. In any case, he was quite interested in formations.

Niu Huaqing was a little excited. He rubbed his hands and said, “From today onwards, I’ll give you special training. One day, you’ll use the formations that I’ve researched to beat that iron lump until he kneels and begs for mercy!”

Ling Han couldn’t bear to spoil his mood, so he nodded, and said with a smile, “Do I have to become your disciple?”

Niu Huaqing shook his head. “Kid, you’re extremely freakish. Your future is limitless. I can only give you a few pointers on formations for the time being. There’s no need to acknowledge me as your master, lest future generations say that I’m shameless.”

Ling Han merely smiled. He treated Niu Huaqing more as a form of respect for an old friend.

“Furthermore, in this world, whether it’s martial arts, formations, or alchemy, they’re just beginning. We’ve only glimpsed a tiny bit of the great dao, so who is qualified to be a teacher?” Niu Huaqing said with great emotion.

Ling Han was astounded. He had not expected Niu Huaqing to have such an understanding.

“Old geezer Niu, why do you think so?”

Niu Huaqing thought for a moment and said, “When I was young, I once entered an ancient site. It could be said to be magical. I clearly entered in a wilderness, but after crossing through a doorway, it was a vast ocean and a country of swamps.”

“That’s definitely not an illusion!” He emphasized. “It’s spatial technology. A door is equivalent to a wormhole. It’s incomparably magical!”

His face was full of excitement: “With this kind of technology, even a formations grandmaster like me can’t see through it at all. It can be seen that the world we have touched is only the tip of the iceberg.”

Ling Han was also somewhat interested, and said, “General Vajra and the others have advanced into the Inscription Tier at least 60 to 70 years ago, right? And now, we’re only in the Elementary Level of a Great Era. Why haven’t General Vajra and the others been able to advance any further?”

This was very unreasonable. Those who could stand out now were definitely martial arts prodigies. Then why was their progress so slow at the Elementary Level?

“Good question!” Niu Huaqing nodded, revealing a look of admiration. “I’ve also studied this question. About ninety years ago, Iron Lump and the others had already advanced into the Inscription Tier, but after all these years, they’ve at most reached Five Inscriptions.”

“Why?”

“According to my deduction, that is because of the environment of heaven and earth.”

“Oh?” Ling Han’s eyes lit up. “I’d like to hear the details.”

“This matter started more than 120 years ago.” Niu Hua cleared his throat. “Before this time, there had never been a cultivator on the Celestial Sea Planet. However, some cultivation techniques and even formations had already been passed down.”

Ling Han was astounded. There were cultivation techniques passed down, and there were formations that were universally known, but no one had mastered

Wasn’t this strange?

“However, after that point in time, wild beasts began to evolve rapidly, and humans are actually the same,” Niu Huaqing said solemnly. “Therefore, I speculate that the environment of heaven and earth has changed.”

“If you want to cultivate, you have to sense the power of heaven and earth, right? But in the past, if this didn’t exist, how would you be able to sense and cultivate

“It’s the same for formations. If you want to borrow the power of heaven and earth, there’s no power to borrow. The formation foundations are just a few broken rocks and iron rods.”

This explanation made a lot of sense. It was just like how in the Genesis World, if there were only cultivation techniques but no Spiritual Qi, how could one cultivate?

Ling Han drew inferences, and said, “Old geezer, what you mean is that although we’re still at the beginning of the myriad of Dao, because the changes in the environment of heaven and earth haven’t caught up yet, the appearance of higher level cultivators have been restricted, which also makes the number of High Level cultivators very small.”

“That’s right!” Niu Huaqing nodded, his expression full of admiration. Talking to a smart person was indeed comfortable, because one point was all it took, and Ling Han was even more able to draw inferences, which made him even happier.

“Therefore, this is your chance to catch up quickly,” the old geezer said. “Iron Lump and the others can no longer enter. That would be equivalent to them staying where they are and waiting for you.”

Ling Han nodded, and then said with a smile, “I’m afraid that when I reach their height, the environment of heaven and earth will still remain unchanged. That would be depressing.”

The path of martial arts was clearly still very long, but they were restricted by the environment of heaven and earth and could not advance. Just thinking about it made one’s heart feel stifled.

“That won’t happen.” Niu Huaqing shook her head. “Since heaven and earth have already been revived, this process cannot be stopped. Right now, it is only temporarily stagnant, just like the calm before the arrival of the storm. Once it starts again, it will definitely be incomparably violent.”

“So now is the best time to catch up.”

‘Indeed.’

Ling Han agreed. At this time, if he couldn’t catch up quickly, it would be just like when he had just entered the Celestial Realm. Any random person he picked out would be much stronger than him, and the time needed to reach the Ninth Heaven would be in the hundreds of millions of years.

Therefore, every minute and second was extremely precious now. If one was not careful and fell behind, when the environment of heaven and earth changed again, a great era would come rolling over, and the people behind would be left behind.

“Right, how did you get in, old man?” Ling Han was surprised. Entering the academy required a fingerprint scan.

Niu Huaqing scoffed with a disdainful expression. “This academy’s formations were set up by me!”

Oh, no wonder.

The old geezer could take a completely different path. The defensive formations would not be activated at all, and he could walk on the ground as if It was flat ground.

“Come, brat, this old man will teach you formations!” Niu Huaqing said.

Originally, he had not intended to personally teach Ling Han formations. Instead, he wanted Ling Han to stay in the Formations Association for a period of time and reach the Middle Level or even High Level before he would personally guide him.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, who would have thought that Huju City would encounter such a calamity?

There were many things that Ling Han had to focus on, but since Niu Huaqing was so excited, Ling Han didn’t want to disappoint him. In any case, he was still learning something, so he would learn formations for a few days first.

Niu Huaqing was a prodigy in formations, but being a prodigy didn’t mean that he was a qualified teacher. He didn’t care if Ling Han understood or not, and just told him his understanding of formations, letting Ling Han remember it in his heart, and then practice it. If there was anything he didn’t understand, he would ask him again.

How many years had he stayed in the Divine Stone?

Which one – martial arts, alchemy, and formations – was he not proficient in?

Therefore, all he needed was to absorb knowledge. After the door had been opened to him, he would be able to grow quickly, and shockingly quickly..
