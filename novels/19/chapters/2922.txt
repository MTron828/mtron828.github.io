2923 A Seventh Tier Emerges

Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu all felt their chests become muffled, and almost lost control of their power, toppling down from the skies.

The three of them were astounded. Just what kind of terrifying aura was this that it could actually have such a terrifying effect on them?

However, this aura had disappeared after a single sweep.

“So this is the change?”

!!

“This aura is too terrifying. It’s at least a Sixth Tier elite, but this is clearly a dead land, so where did a Sixth Tier elite come from?”

“Don’t tell me that there are still living Sixth Tier elites buried underneath!”

Ling Han thought for a moment, then shook his head, and said, “That’s not very possible. Senior Zhou and the others have already explored the ninth dimension, and all the veins of ore should have been swept clean, and it is impossible for anything to be left behind.”

“If there’s a Sixth Tier elite hidden in the 10th dimension Even Senior Zhou and the others can’t enter there, so how can he release his aura?”

“Don’t tell me that there are still Seventh Tier elites sleeping here, and they’re about to awaken!”

If this was true, then this would be a really huge matter.

The Seventh Tier was considered the strongest in the world, indestructible and undying Alright, one had died, but Ling Han had absolutely no idea how he had been killed.

If a Seventh Tier were to appear, then if they did evil, the whole Genesis World would suffer.

The party observed here, and discovered that that aura from before appeared again after 67 days. It was incredibly terrifying.

However, the next time, only 66 days had passed, and this aura appeared once more.

Next, it was 65 days, 64 days, and 63 days, and the intervals became shorter and shorter, causing Ling Han and the others to feel even more uneasy.

If this was an elite slumbering, then this aura was becoming more and more active. The time for his emergence should be drawing closer and closer.

They ventured deep into the eighth dimension, and observed it from a close distance. However, they could only sense the vastness and majesty of this aura, yet still couldn’t find its source.

After a few days, Zhou Heng, as well as three other Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, came out of the ninth dimension.

“Senior Zhou!” Ling Han hurriedly went up to greet him. “Have you discovered anything?”

“The source comes from the 10th level, or perhaps even the dimension below it,” Zhou Heng said solemnly. “Underneath this it’s extremely likely that a living Seventh Tier elite has been buried!”

Previously, a Seventh Tier had also been unearthed from raw stone, but that was a corpse, and now it was a living Seventh Tier. The significance was completely different.

“Brother Zhou, will you ask your master to make a trip here?” a Sixth Tier elite beside them asked.

He was Rong Tianyu, an ally of Lin Xiaoyang, Zhou Heng, and Chu Hao.

Zhou Heng nodded. “This matter is too important. Even if Master does not come personally, he will at least have to send out a doppelganger.”

No one thought that this was an exaggerated measure. The emergence of a new Seventh Tier elite was too shocking.

More and more people arrived. Zhou Heng and the other Sixth Tiers even made arrangements to set up a base here because if that newly emerged Seventh Tier elite bore malicious intent, he should be suppressed. Even if he couldn’t be killed, he would be eternally sealed here.

Sixth Tiers couldn’t do it, so Lin Luo, Bai Fan, Xin Fu, and the other Seventh Tiers all sent out a doppelganger, which meant that the greatest power of Heavenly Venerates of the entire Genesis World was gathered here.

As for Hysteria’s troops?

Forget about them for now. Under the suppression of the dimension, the defenders only had to leave behind a small number of troops, and they would be able to resist. This place was too crucial.

13 days, 12 days That aura appeared more and more frequently. Finally, it appeared a few times in a single day, and the ground began to tremble, as if all the dimensions were about to collapse.

Seventh Tier elites possessed such power.

“He’s about to emerge,” Zhou Heng murmured, frowning deeply.

Though there were presently as many as 70 Sixth Tiers here, and there were also at least five doppelgangers of Seventh Tier elites, they might still be unable to suppress a real Seventh Tier elite No one was certain of that.

A Seventh Tier was too strong. Having fused six fundamental powers together, he was definitely invincible.

Only a Seventh Tier would be able to stand against another Seventh Tier. This was an ironclad rule.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

When this aura fluctuated like the breathing of an ordinary person, drum-like sounds rang out, causing pain to everyone’s ears. Some people were even bleeding from their seven apertures.

It should be known that this was the eighth dimension. Those that could come here all had battle prowess on par with Fifth Tier elites!

Even such elites would be shaken to the point of bleeding from his seven apertures, and it was merely because of a sound?

This was far too terrifying.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu! Five figures appeared, all of them exuding boundless light.

Their appearance could not be clearly seen at all, but the moment they appeared, that drumbeat immediately became smaller, and could no longer cause any effect.

These were the doppelgangers of five Seventh Tier elites!

Ling Han rubbed his nose. He wasn’t bleeding so terribly from his seven apertures, but it was inevitable that he would have a nosebleed. He couldn’t help but feel shocked. Even the Seventh Tier elites had been mobilized, so was there really a Seventh Tier elite about to appear?

Would the secrets of this lost primitive dimension that had been sealed for countless years finally be unraveled?

Peng!

A pillar of light rose into the sky, and the terrifying aura instantly soared madly like a tidal wave. The five Seventh Tier elites all took a few steps back, and actually looked like they were outmatched.

Could it be that this Seventh Tier that had not emerged was strong to this extent?

Of course not; it was because these five supreme beings were only doppelgangers. No matter how strong doppelgangers were, how could they compare to the original?

“Sigh!” A long sigh rang out in everyone’s mind.

“After a long dream, eternity will pass.

“Reminiscing the mortal world, epochs pass like dreams.”

A figure slowly walked out from underground, calm and composed. However, when he appeared in the center of the masses, no one could see his true appearance.

“What is it? Putting on such a grand display, are you planning to kill me?” This person’s eyes swept over the surroundings, and he couldn’t help but laugh loudly. His voice was like thunder, shaking a great many people to the point that they stumbled, and could not stand steadily no matter how hard they tried.

...

So this was a Seventh Tier ultimate elite?

He was too strong, having such might with just a laugh. If he really attacked, how could even Sixth Tier elites withstand his strike?

“How should I address you, sir?” a Seventh Tier elite elite’s doppelganger asked, not knowing who he really was.

At present, even Sixth Tiers were not qualified to speak. They could only play the role of spectators on the sidelines.

“Me?” The newly emerged Seventh Tier chuckled. He stretched out his arms, and drew on the fundamental power of heaven and earth. A smile appeared on his face. “As expected, the Void is indestructible, and life is reborn from death.”

“Sir, who exactly are you?” another Seventh Tier elite’s doppelganger asked.

“Oh, if I don’t say anything, could it be that you guys plan to compel me?” The newly born Seventh Tier chuckled, completely unconcerned. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Seventh Tier elites were undying and indestructible, and even against Hysteria, they didn’t need to fear. Whom did they need to give face to?

“Old friends, all of you, wake up!” the Seventh Tier shouted lightly, and his palm delivered a palm strike onto the ground,

Boom! Not only was this dimension trembling violently, but the seventh and sixth dimensions were also trembling under the transmission of power. Moreover, the power was still spreading upwards. Similarly, the power was also spreading downwards, reaching the ninth dimension, the 10th dimension, and even further downwards.

After only a short while, four extremely terrifying auras spread out.
