2797 A father again

The third piece of news was regarding those anomalies that had professed their allegiance.

Correct; after the discussion of those mighty figures, they decided to give these anomalies a chance, and sent them to the fourth level to join the armies of the Flaming Frost Realm.

Of course, no one would trust them easily. Trust was something that they had to earn themselves.

Ling Han scratched his head. “Then, I am a popular guy right now, and everyone wants a bite of me?”

The Empress smiled beautifully. “I don’t know about others, but I do indeed very much want to ‘bite’ you.”

Ling Han’s heartbeat involuntarily quickened. This wife was already too beautiful for words, and now that she was deliberately flirting with him, how could he hold himself back?

Peng! He pounced on her.

However, before he could proceed to make the next move, Bewitching Maiden Rou had suddenly barged in, calling an abrupt halt to Ling Han’s actions.

F***, this witch had to have done it on purpose.

Ling Han spent an affectionate time with the two women, and began his cultivation again.

After obtaining the Heavenly Venerable Seal, he had not studied it seriously yet. He had previously been recuperating all this while, and only now did he manage to get some time to study it.

After sitting down quietly, Ling Han studied this newly gained Heavenly Venerable Seal in his mind, and he named it the Ninth Seal.

He continued his analysis, and fully comprehended this seal, taking at least 300 years to do so.

Ling Han channeled this seal, and then extracted the power of heaven and earth. Instantly, that unique power surged towards him. This seal had increased the efficiency by about 15 times.

This was even stronger than the Eighth Seal!

However, Ling Han immediately shook his head. The Eighth Seal was incomplete, and there was only a third of it. If he could complete it, the efficiency would possibly be increased to 20 or 30 times, far surpassing the Ninth Seal.

Thus, he focused his energy on mending the Eighth Seal. Time continued to pass, and his progress was negligible. In fact, it could not be considered progress at all. Though he was trying to mend it, it had not increased his efficiency by even the slightest bit.

Because his cultivation level was too low, it could not be helped.

Since it could not be helped, he would set this aside for the moment. Ling Han boosted himself with all nine Heavenly Venerable Seals. Weng! The mystical power of heaven and earth surged towards him, increasing his efficiency to about 40 times.

Ling Han came out of seclusion. He chatted with the women, gave some guidance on cultivation to his son and grandson, and generally had a relaxed time.

It was not that no one had made an issue of Ling Han’s “treason,” but even the higher-ups had agreed to accept those anomalies. Who would dare mention this matter again? Wouldn’t that be deliberately trying to oppose the higher-ups?

Hysteria’s army did not disappoint, and launched a considerable number of assaults again. However, with Ling Han present and unleashing the might of the Third Tier, who would be able to cross over a single step?

When the period of 1,000 years was over, the two leaderboards were finally updated, and Ling Han’s name had made it to both the recent leaderboard and general leaderboard at the same time.

…934th on the general leaderboard, and on the recent leaderboard… first place!

This military credit was truly shocking. Simultaneously making it onto both leaderboards? Ling Han was definitely the first. Even Lin Youlian and the other Heavenly Kings had not been able to do so. This naturally made Ling Han famous for a while.

The Empress’s military merit was also glorious. She was ranked second on the recent leaderboard, but there was still a very wide gap between her and Ling Han. Thus, she had not made it onto the general leaderboard.

“Fame has its price. Originally, I was already the butt of public criticism, and now I have simultaneously made it onto both leaderboards. I am sure that there would be a considerable number of people who would want nothing more than to capture and refine me into medicine,” Ling Han murmured.

Previously, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had suppressed Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, using himself as a furnace, and wanting to refine Heavenly Venerate Wu Le and snatch his fruits of cultivation so that he could push open the great doors to the Second Tier.

Though he had ultimately failed, it was also clear that Heavenly Venerates could indeed be refined like they were Great Herbs.

Ling Han had to be careful.

“Husband, why do I feel that not only are you not the slightest bit worried, but rather seem like you are showing off proudly?” Bewitching Maiden Rou walked over, and leaned against Ling Han.

“This is very much like Husband’s style of doing things,” Helian Xunxue expressed her agreement with a nod. Both her son and grandson were outstanding, so her mood was constantly good. However, she was also a little anxious because she had yet to get a great-grandchild.

“I’m sure that it must be because it has been a long time since someone has caused trouble for Husband, which made Husband a little impatient.” Shui Yanyu giggled.

“Teacher Shui, as I see it, you are the impatient one here. Do you wish for husband to dote on you a bit?” Li Sichan joked.

Ling Han shook his head. When there were no strangers, these wives were all very bold and unrestrained. At times, their words would make even him blush.

Zhi!

The doors were pushed open, and the Empress walked inside.

Ling Han glanced at her, and couldn’t help but feel surprised, because the Empress’s expression was very affected, as if she had just sustained a very great shock.

He hurriedly leaped up, wrapped his arms around the Empress, and asked, “Wife, what is it? Who has bullied you? Tell me, and I will avenge you!”

The Empress threw a punch at his chest. “It’s you.”

Instantly, Ling Han relaxed slightly, and said, “How could I bully my wife? What exactly happened?”

“I have,” the Empress said1.

“What have? Have what?” In this instant, Ling Han did not manage to react. Though he had already become a father once, that had been as long as an epoch ago. He thought that his cultivation level was too high, and it was possible that he would never have any other children.

“Idiot, Big Sister is pregnant!” Realization dawned immediately on Bewitching Maiden Rou, and she lightly rapped Ling Han’s head.

“Congratulations, Big Sister!” All the women gathered around her. They were all very pleased. Of course, they also felt a small amount of dejection because they, too, very much wanted to have a child that belonged to them and Ling Han.

However, now that the Empress was pregnant, it meant that a high cultivation level did not mean “infertility.” There was still a chance for them.

Instantly, they all turned plaintive looks on Ling Han. What they were trying to say was, “Husband, you cannot favor one and discriminate against the others. At night, you have to visit our rooms frequently, dividing your attention equally.”

Ling Han shivered from their looks, but when he thought about how he was going to be a father again, he was again delighted. Involuntarily, he wrapped his arms around the Empress’s lower abdomen, leaning his head against her to listen quietly. As expected, he heard a faint sound.

He couldn’t help but bare his mouth in a grin, joy written all over his face.

On this day, he invited Yi, Ji Wuming, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the others one after another, but did not talk about anything serious with them. He just continued to force alcohol on them, confusing the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and the others. The large black dog even wondered if some problem had happened with Ling Han’s sexual orientation. He would run off every time he saw Ling Han, not giving him any chance to hook an arm around his shoulders at all.

Ling Han decided to roam around the world for a bit. He was going to prepare a gift for his unborn child.

When Ling Jianxue had been born, Ling Han had not been present at all, and had only received the happy news long after the birth. But this time, he had no wish to miss out on such an important event.

He made some calculations. The child would be nurtured extremely slowly in the Empress’s womb, but this was not a bad thing, but rather a good one.

How strong was the Empress? The longer the child stayed in the mother’s body, the more nutrition it would absorb, and, naturally, the greater its beginning would be.

...

“Possibly… I would have to wait tens of millions of years.” Ling Han estimated.

This time was really astonishingly long. Ling Han nodded. This was just right such that he had time to make preparations.

He did not give the Empress any celestial medicines. They were already Heavenly Venerates, so any natural treasures or celestial medicines would be useless to them. Or rather, the Empress herself was the best spiritual herb for the child. With her using her essence to nurture the baby, this child would definitely be amazing.

Ling Han went to apply for leave. He was going to search for a great fated opportunity for his child. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He had outstanding military merits, and added with the fact that this was not an indefinite period of leave, but would rather only be 100,000,000 years at most, the person in charge of the second level approved the request for leave very quickly.
