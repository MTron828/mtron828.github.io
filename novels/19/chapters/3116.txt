3117 Reforging the meridians

As soon as the words were uttered, He Miaoyin was stunned. She had actually lowered her head in front of a lowly servant.

What she didn’t know was that Ling Han had even channeled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique when he shouted, which was why he had directly stunned her mind.

Seeing that He Miaoyin had really apologized, everyone found it unacceptable.

Who didn’t know that He Miaoyin was incomparably proud, and had the temperament of an extremely spoiled young mistress? To say nothing of insulting others, she had even beaten up junior brothers of the sect before. However, others were apprehensive of her grandfather, and thus chose to keep the peace; they didn’t dare to complain to the sect at all.

She even managed to suppress such a serious matter, but now, she was lowering her head just because she had called the maid a “b*tch”?

Unbelievable!

Everyone looked at He Miaoyin, and then at Ling Han. They all had a feeling that perhaps a real dragon of the sect was about to soar.

However, Ling Han was very dissatisfied. He first suppressed He Miaoyin in terms of aura, and then used the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique and combined it with a shout. Only then was He Miaoyin caught off guard and blurted out the words “I’m sorry.”

Sigh, if it had been in the past, he would already have made her kneel and kowtow.

He shook his head, and said to Huan Xue, “Let’s go.”

Huan Xue’s face was filled with pride. This was her master. For her, he could go against a young mistress like He Miaoyin. He was her god.

She obediently walked behind Ling Han carefully.

Ling Han started walking. When he walked past Rui Yuanliang and the other two, he paused for a moment, and said, “Thanks.”

Thanks for what?

The others were all baffled, but Rui Yuanliang and the other two knew why. Ling Han was “thanking” them for personally giving him a Meridian Guiding Pill.

They really wanted to vomit blood.

This matter of stealing the pill would definitely be exposed. When that happened, He Miaoyin would naturally ask them to pay compensation.

Originally, as long as they had successfully framed Ling Han and Huan Xue, then naturally no one would have called them to account for this matter, but now they had to swallow this grievance in silence.

Otherwise, if word got out that they had framed their junior brother from the same sect, they would be kicked out of the sect, and even their elders would not be able to save them.

If it was just stealing the pill, they could still say that they were fooling around with He Miaoyin, and it wouldn’t be that difficult to resolve the matter.

They were all extremely depressed. They had laid such a flawless trap, so how could Ling Han easily jump out of it, and even conveniently trample all over their faces?

This Ling Han!

Ling Han continued walking, and when he reached Nie Yang’s side, he paused again.

Nie Yang smiled at him and winked at him.

Obviously, this guy had also recognized Ling Han. After all, Ling Han didn’t change his voice at that time.

Yes, just as he had expected, this person was a show-off.

With everyone watching, Ling Han and Huan Xue walked out of the main hall, out of the courtyard, and then headed back to their residence.

After returning home, Huan Xue hurriedly handed the Meridian Guiding Pill to Ling Han, and said, “Young Master, Huan Xue almost implicated you today!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Since this was ‘gifted’ to you by someone else, take it.”

He recalled the faces of Rui Yuanliang and the other two, and the corners of his mouth revealed a menacing expression. They actually dared to extend their claws toward him?

However, the mastermind behind all this should be Li Changdan, right?

Just because of the title of the Dao Child, this fellow was conspiring to get rid of Ling Han?

Ling Han was now certain that the person who had ordered Zheng Tongfeng to bring him to the casino and wanted him to fall was definitely Li Changdan.

However, Li Changdan was known as a prodigy, and was now at the peak stage of the Nine Meridians. His battle prowess was probably much stronger than that of ordinary people. If the two of them were to engage in a fierce battle now, Ling Han would definitely lose.

The higher one’s cultivation level was, the greater the difference in strength. This was especially true for the Ten Meridians. This was a dividing line.

Why could one only become a sect elder after opening the Ten Meridians?

This was because a cultivator’s strength would undergo a huge transformation after his cultivation had advanced to Ten Meridians.

The power he cultivated in his body could be unleashed from afar, and at Twelve Meridians, he could even injure people 100 steps away. His opponents weren’t even qualified to approach him.

“It’s all about ability. Ability!” Ling Han muttered. “If I let Li Changdan advance to Ten Meridians first, then I will be at an absolute disadvantage. Therefore, I must catch up to his cultivation as soon as possible.”

The next morning, he welcomed the morning sun and cultivated as usual, and the little maidservant also joined in.

He sat at the side and cultivated, while Huan Xue was practicing fist techniques.

This scene was a little strange. Ling Han was clearly a tall man with long legs, but he was sitting quietly at the side, while a delicate beauty was punching and kicking, making her seem very violent.

Ling Han’s nostrils flared. Instantly, invisible energy was inhaled through his nose, and circulated within his body.

Absorption of the energy wasn’t just limited to his meridians; even a portion of his physical body would similarly absorb the energy. It was probably due to the tempering by this energy that his physical body had advanced to become even more powerful.

Brother Monkey had said that this cultivation technique had great benefits. As expected, the more one cultivated it, the more one would gain new insights.

Half an hour was naturally not a long time, and Ling Han used the Spirit Gathering Formation again. However, he discovered that as his cultivation level increased, the effect of the Spirit Gathering Formation on him also became weaker and weaker. It was already far inferior to half an hour ago when the sun rose, and seemed very useless.

‘Is the level of the Spirit Gathering Formation too low?’

Ling Han deduced that the martial arts of this world had just begun, and everything originated from ancient sites buried deep underground. In that case, the formations that had appeared now were naturally very backward, and belonged to the most superficial level.

‘No, another reason is because of the cultivation technique I’m cultivating now.’

Ling Han’s insight was naturally sharp. He discovered that the cultivation technique he was currently cultivating was like a millstone, grinding and purifying the power in his body, removing the dregs, leaving behind essence, and increasing the level of quality.

However, this would definitely cause his cultivation speed to slow down.

His cultivation when the sun rose was still alright. The energy of heaven and earth was very pure to begin with. Although some impurities would be removed, there were not many of them. At most, half of them would be worn away. However, the energy produced by the Spirit Gathering Formation was different. There were countless impurities, and it was difficult to sieve through all of them.

Therefore, the effect of the Spirit Gathering Formation was greatly reduced.

‘If I were to use the Four Directional Fists, such a situation would not happen. It would allow my cultivation level to continue increasing at a high speed.

‘But what’s the point of having such a high cultivation level?

‘It’s just an empty shell. It looks good, but it’s useless.

‘When you’re building your foundation, you must not take shortcuts.’

Ling Han decided to reconstruct the meridians he had previously cultivated and purify his power. Otherwise, this would definitely affect his advancement in the future.

‘Fortunately, I met Brother Monkey. Otherwise, if I finished cultivating the Meridian Opening Tier with the Four Directional Fists, then I don’t know how much of a price I would have to pay if I wanted to reconstruct the foundation in the future.’

Ling Han went on to re-cultivate the few meridians from before. This was because he didn’t need to absorb external energy, so there was no time limit on cultivation[1].

After spending three days, he had completely purified the power in his body. Although his cultivation level had decreased significantly, his power hadn’t. Instead, the power of his attacks had increased.

“It’s like a sword. If it’s filled with impurities, even if it’s struck with great power, it will only shatter when it clashes with a stone.

“However, if it is forged into a sword of refined iron, even if its power is slightly weaker, it can still leave marks on the stone.”
