Chapter 1376 Divine Sword Developing a Spiri

In Ling Han’s eyes, the Treasure Forest Pavilion was simply occupying this place—they definitely weren’t the owner of this place. For example, they would have to avoid the puppets if they wanted to harvest any of the medicinal plants. However, if they were the true owner of this place, would they need to go through so much trouble?

“Moreover, to me, any puppet is a gift,” Ling Han said with a chuckle as he gazed at the humanoid puppet below the Divine Tree. “I wonder how powerful this puppet is.”

This was practically a gift for him!

Puppets didn’t possess a conscious mind, so they could be easily absorbed into the Black Tower. They wouldn’t be able able to resist even if they possessed power at the Genesis Tier—unless they had developed intelligence.

Ling Han flew down and arrived before the tree.

The puppet that was caring for the Divine Tree was immediately alarmed, and it instantly charged toward Ling Han at an astonishing speed.

Ling Han didn’t immediately activate the Black Tower. Instead, he exchanged a strike with the puppet, testing the puppet’s strength.

Peng!

Ling Han was instantly sent flying. A cloud of blood sprayed from his body, dying his clothes a light shade of red.

‘Such formidable power!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

The power of this puppet had already reached the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, it naturally possessed a crushing advantage over him. It pushed him back with a single strike, even causing his Godly bones to groan and quiver as if they were going to fall apart.

The puppet naturally wouldn’t feel any emotion, and it dashed toward Ling Han with a single step, launching another attack to deal the killing blow.

“Enough!” Ling Han waved his hand, and his divine sense instantly enveloped the puppet.

Xiu!

With a thought, the puppet disappeared from before him.

In the Black Tower, Ling Han was God!

He easily dismantled the powerful puppet. To his delight, he found that over 70% of the puppet was made from Godly metal.

‘So much Godly metal!

‘I’m rich, I’m rich!’

Ling Han decided that even if he didn’t obtain any pill recipe, he would still capture all of the puppets level eight and above in this mystery realm. He would extract the Godly metal from their bodies and feed it to his Divine Demon Sword.

However, the most important task right now was to uproot this Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree and place it into the Black Tower.

In fact, this was a fairly simple task. Ling Han used his hand like a shovel, easily uprooting the Divine Tree along with a large chunk of soil with his overwhelming power. He then absorbed it into the Black Tower and planted it down. With this done, the Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree truly belonged to him now.

“Hehe, let’s continue!” Ling Han said in excitement. Right now, his main goal was to raise the quality of the Divine Demon Sword.

He continued forward. This mystery realm was brimming with medicine fields, and there was certainly no shortage of puppets.

However, Ling Han didn’t capture them indiscriminately. Instead, he carefully examined them, only capturing those whose power had reached the Heavenly Body Tier. Power at the Heavenly Body Tier meant that these puppets definitely contained Level Nine Godly metal inside them. If the power of the puppets didn’t meet this criterion, he would leave them alone, allowing them to continue their menial tasks of caring for the medicinal plants.

He was only leaving these puppets alone because of his relationship with Lin Yuqi. After all, it was because of her that he had the opportunity to enter this mystery realm. A person shouldn’t forget the goodwill of others.

Even so, he still captured and dismantled many puppets.

Moreover, Godly medicines that were guarded by such powerful puppets were all at least Level Eight Godly medicines. Ling Han was giddy with joy as he harvested these Godly medicines.

When members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion entered this mystery realm, they would all strictly abide by the rules—they wouldn’t harvest any medicinal ingredient that was unripe. However, Ling Han didn’t have any such worries. After placing the medicinal ingredients into the Black Tower, they would only grow quicker and better. There would be no waste at all.

He continued to capture puppets and harvest Godly medicines, and he continued to dismantle the puppets and feed Godly metal to the Divine Demon Sword.

Because the four major clans had already occupied this mystery realm for hundreds of millions of years, they had already compiled very detailed information about all of the levels, apart from level nine. The map that they had produced was also very complete and accurate. Using this map, Ling Han spent about 10 days visiting all of the locations that had valuable Godly medicines.

The map in his hand clearly marked which location had Godly medicines of what level. In fact, even the “years to maturity” was clearly labeled beside the locations. This was the culmination of many years of hard work and careful exploration by the previous generations of the four major clans.

Right now, the only place left to visit was the shrine that connected the first level of the mystery realm to the second. He had already visited all of the other places that were worth visiting.

“The Divine Demon Sword should be able to level up now, right?”

Right now, the Divine Demon Sword had already grown back to its original size. Ling Han retrieved a piece of Level Nine Godly metal and fed it to the Divine Demon Sword. When this piece of Godly metal transformed into crumbs, the Divine Demon Sword suddenly released a brilliant light that was as radiant as the sun.

Level 10!

Ling Han laughed heartily. The quality of the Divine Demon Sword had already surpassed his cultivation level. However, because the sword was imbued with his martial intent, its might didn’t increase significantly, even though its quality had already elevated another level.

After all, without the input of a person, a tool would only be a tool.

However, Ling Han wasn’t worried about this. Now that the Divine Demon Sword had caught up to his pace, its might would naturally increase once he advanced to the medium extreme.

Xiu!

A person suddenly shot over and landed 30 or so meters before Ling Han.

“Leave your sword and then piss off!” the person commanded coldly.

This was a skinny man who wore a dark expression. His fingers were slender and powerful, and it was clear at a glance that he was also a wielder of swords.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and asked, “Are you trying to rob me?” This person was only at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, so where were his courage and confidence coming from?

In fact, this wasn’t surprising at all. Ling Han was suppressing his aura right now, so one wouldn’t be able to determine his cultivation level unless they were also at the Heavenly Body Tier. Moreover, he looked extremely young, so who would imagine that he was a Heavenly Body Tier elite?

“The sword will only be spoiled in your hands!” the man said. There was a glimmer of excitement in his eyes as he gazed at the Divine Demon Sword. Indeed, his gaze was a gaze that could only belong to those who truly loved swords.

“The sword won’t be spoiled in your hands?” Ling Han asked in retort.

“Correct,” the man replied proudly. “I started to practice swordplay at five, and I was given the title of ‘sword maniac’ at 17. My life is loyal to swords, and it is devoted to swords.”

Ling Han stabbed the Divine Demon Sword into the earth with a smile, and said, “If you can pull the sword from the earth, then it’s yours.” He took a few steps back, signifying that this wasn’t a trap.

The man didn’t see any problem with this. He was already at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, so he was definitely one of the most powerful people under 1,000,000 years old. Only a rare few people could match him when it came to cultivation level, to say nothing of surpassing him.

In his eyes, Ling Han’s concession was only reasonable and natural.

He walked over to retrieve the sword.

Weng!

A brilliant light instantly burst from the Divine Demon Sword as if warning him not to walk any closer. The man was naturally unafraid, and he activated his own martial intent, ferociously unleashing his sword intent. He was going to use his sword intent to subdue the Divine Demon Sword.

The man and sword fought intensely. Gradually, the light that was radiating from the Divine Demon Sword became dimmer and dimmer. It was as if it were running out of power to resist.

Ling Han was slightly surprised.

He wasn’t surprised about the man’s strength, nor was he surprised about the Divine Demon Sword’s weakness. In reality, the Divine Demon Sword hadn’t even unleashed one-ten-thousandth of its might. It was completely toying around with its opponent!

It was this that had astonished Ling Han.

‘The Divine Demon Sword has actually learned to toy around with others?’

Only after developing a spirit and developing some intelligence would a sword know how to toy around with others.

Ling Han involuntarily stroked his chin. The behavior of his weapon wasn’t very serious. Where had it learned this from?

He wasn’t this unreliable, was he?
