Chapter 660: Ghost Lock Ravine

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Henyee

Ling Han had done it deliberately.

The five ancient great sects were so despicable, so Ling Han would naturally be happy to give them some trouble. Moreover, the more people enrolled into the Restore Heaven Academy, the more parties would Ling Han be able to persuade into joining his camp.

His goal was to establish a great empire and unite the whole realm. Thus, he would naturally not mind it if some parties were stronger, or some parties were weaker.

Who cares, I’m merely here to conquer.

Yet Ling Han did not dare go too far, either. Otherwise, he would become a target of the Restore Heaven Academy. Now, he could only act secretly, and once he had done what he wanted, he’d just run, and no one would know that it was him.

After pulling out a total of 20 array flags, Ling Han, Zhu Xuan Er, and Hu Niu finally set off towards Ghost Lock Ravine. When they arrived, it was already the second night, and there had long since been others who had entered ahead of them and began the second test in advance.

Only those who entered here in three days’ time would be qualified to enroll in the Academy, and, consecutively, whoever obtained the biggest number of stones, the most attention they would obtain from the Academy.

“Hu Niu, let’s go robbing!” Ling Han laughed.

“En!” Hu Niu nodded crisply, instantly energized.

Stuff like robbing was her favorite activity.

Zhu Xuan Er merely smiled, and looked at Ling Han tenderly.

“First and Second Brother should have arrived long ago,” Ling Han said. “I wonder how good their harvest is.”

They journeyed in this ravine, yet saw wisps of fog enshrouding all their surroundings, making for a very spooky atmosphere. No wonder it had the name “Ghost Lock Ravine”. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Ling Han! Ling Han!” A call echoed behind them, and they turned to see Qin Lian Yue had caught up with them. Her bountiful **** danced with her movements, like waves surging forth, looking very majestic.

“Oh, what a coincidence!” Ling Han waved.

“Yi, hadn’t you all long since run ahead of me? Why have you arrived just a little earlier than me?” Qin Lian Yue was very confused.

“The scenery on the way was not too bad, so I spent some additional time to admire it,” Ling Han said.

Qin Lian Yue rolled her beautiful eyes. This was definitely a lie; if she actually believed him, there would definitely be something wrong with her! However, her attention was soon drawn to the ravine, and she said, “I heard that there really are evil ghosts sealed within this Ghost Lock Ravine.”

“Really?” Zhu Xuan Er asked immediately, very curious.

“Of course it’s real. It’s rumored that it’s an old evil ghost that is millennia old, terrifyingly violent and cruel,” Qin Lian Yue described vividly, frightening and dazing Zhu Xuan Er.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Even Shattering Void Tier cultivators only have a lifespan of over a thousand years. What kind of old evil ghost is that amazing that it can live for several millennia?”

“Tsk, you don’t understand. How could ghosts be the same as human beings?” Qin Lian Yue said disdainfully.

“What’s the difference?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

How could Qin Lian Yue actually point out the differences? She could only retort, “I am not a ghost, so how would I know!”

Ling Han made no further jokes, and said, “However, if there really were ghosts here, I really would like to take a look.”

“Niu wants to see too.” Hu Niu followed Ling Han’s lead.

“What’s there to see about ghosts.” Qin Lian Yue immediately shook her head. Zhu Xuan Er also expressed her deep agreement. Girls feared this kind of thing the most.

They advanced, and soon, they spotted Li Feng Yu and his sister. That guy was really quite thick-skinned, forcing his way into their group, and formed a small team with Ling Han and the others.

“This place is so spooky, there can’t really be ghosts here, right?” Li Feng Yu asked.

“Hey, hey, hey. Don’t such inauspicious things!” everyone else exclaimed, feeling their hair standing on ends just from listening to him.

The further they walked, the darker their surroundings became, as if it had become a ghostly zone.

“Yi, what’s that?” Li Zi Xian asked, pointing ahead.

“A bone.” Hu Niu’s eyes were sharp,

The group walked forwards, and saw that there was indeed a bone on the ground. They did not know whether it belonged to an animal or a human, or how long the owner had been dead for, but they could still see the bone glowing as if it was a piece of treasure.

“This is a human bone,” Qin Lian Yue said with absolute certainty.

Ling Han nodded. This was indeed a human bone. When the owner had been alive, he must have been very powerful, because there were patterns left behind on the bone that formed some kind of inheritance. Now, these patterns were more or less worn away, but one could still how powerful it had once been.

“No existence could fight off the erosion of time.” He felt very rueful. To be capable of forming patterns on even one’s bones would require the cultivation level of the Heaven Tier at the very least, but so what? A few centuries and a few millennia later, all that was left behind was a pile of bones, and even the bones themselves would deteriorate before completely disappearing from the world.

“Yi, the bone seems to be shining!” Li Feng Yu was very curious, and was just about to dig the bone out, but his hand had just touched the bone when an incredibly bright, powerful flash of light appeared

Peng , he was instantly sent flying.

Everyone was stunned; was this the rise of the dead? But how was a dead corpse that had died who knew how many years ago, and whose bone patterns were almost worn away to nothing, supposed to rise?

Ka, ka, ka, ka . The ground split open. Peng , a skeletal hand stretched out, followed by the second one. Then, they saw a skeleton crawl out of the dirt, and in its chest was a stone that was glowing with light.

Wasn’t that the stone they were supposed to fight over?

Realization dawned on them. The secret to this skeleton being able to move even after death was this stone. It seemed to have turned this skeleton into a puppet, and caused it to move under its control.

The skeleton exuded a powerful aura. Its cultivation level had, after all, been extremely high when it had still been alive. Even if its bone patterns were almost worn away to nothing after death, it was still overwhelmingly powerful.

‘Peak of the Spiritual Infant Tier.” They all nodded.

“Charge!” Hu Niu charged out, and engaged the skeleton in a fierce battle.

This skeleton was really very strong. Its bones were protected by the patterns, and were thus incredibly hard; the strange stone was the source of its strength, allowing it to display battle prowess on the level of the peak of the Spiritual Infant Tier.

Theoretically, this skeleton was definitely not something that could be beaten by a cultivator in the Spiritual Infant Tier, because in terms of defense, it was unbeatable. However, since the source of its energy was the stone in its chest, then one only had to remove the stone, and it would naturally be reduced to a perfectly normal pile of bones.

This design made it extremely difficult to get ahold of the strange stone, but it was not completely impossible.

Yet Hu Niu did not bother at all, and completely ignored the presence of the stone. Instead, she clashed against the skeleton endlessly with peng, peng, pengsounds. Zizizi , she used the power of lightning, and after every attack, the skeleton would shiver as if it was soon about to collapse and shatter.

Everyone was dumbfounded. This little girl was really a violent maniac. She actually wanted to forcefully kill a skeleton that, to them, seemed impossible to kill in a head-on confrontation. They were all flushed as well, for they felt like they couldn’t even match a little girl.

After over a dozen moves, this skeleton monster was forcefully shattered apart by Hu Niu.

The little girl picked up the stone, and scampered back to hand it over to Ling Han. After getting a praising pat on the head from Ling Han, she happily beamed with joy.

How easily coaxed!

Everyone else felt rueful over Ling Han’s good fortune; he had actually managed to pick up such a powerful little girl as his loyal thug.

It seemed like their luck was quite good. After walking for a while, they again found a bone on a spot, and when they came closer, indeed, another skeleton crawled out of the ground. There was a strange shining stone in its chest.

This time, Ling Han attacked, and charged towards the skeleton. He attacked head-on as well, and did not have the slightest intention of a diversionary strategy at all, causing those who saw him grab their heads and declare him a monster in their shock.
