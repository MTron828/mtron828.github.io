2842 Meng Dong

Meng Dong glanced at Zhuang Bi, and said smilingly, “You are a peak-stage Fourth Tier, and I am no match for you for now.”

These were honest words, but Zhuang Bi was not pleased at all hearing them from Meng Dong. Wasn’t this implying that Zhuang Bi would very quickly be surpassed?

Facing a Second Tier being so disrespectful in front of him, a Fourth Tier, he was outraged.

But so what?

!!

Though Meng Dong was not his match, there wasn’t much of a difference between them in strength. At most, Zhuang Bi would only be able to wound him, and there was no way he could inflict serious injury on his opponent, so it was natural that his opponent could act arrogant in front of him.

“Meng Dong, are your previous words serious?” a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate asked.

“Of course,” Meng Dong replied proudly.

“Alright, count me in.” This Third Tier stepped out.

“Count me in as well.” Another Third Tier stepped out.

“Me too.”

One after another, there were soon 10 of them.

“Very good, come fight me!” Meng Dong took out 10 stone slabs which had Heavenly Venerable Seals sealed within them, and tossed them casually over to Zhuang Bi.

Those 10 Third Tiers also served a Heavenly Venerable Seal from their minds respectively, and sealed them in special stones, which they then handed over to Zhuang Bi. If they won, each of them would be able to win a single Heavenly Venerable Seal, and if they lost, the 10 Heavenly Venerable Seals would all belong to Meng Dong.

“Begin,” Zhuang Bi announced.

The 10 Third Tier Heavenly Venerates immediately moved. However, they soon paled in shock because Meng Dong’s battle prowess far exceeded their imagination. The moment they started fighting, he had already laid absolute claim to the upper hand.

They fought back with great effort, using all kinds of powerful techniques, but it was completely useless under the suppression of absolute strength.

Very quickly, they were all defeated.

“Thanks,” Meng Dong said smilingly.

Those 10 Third Tier Heavenly Venerates could only look livid. Having lost when there were 10 Third Tiers fighting against a single Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, what else could they say? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Anyone else?” Meng Dong asked with a grin.

No one answered. There were not many that could suppress Meng Dong even among Fourth Tiers, and it was clear that Meng Dong could not possibly agree to fight with this kind of elites.

“Hahaha, if no one is going to fight, there will be no need for me to come here next time!” Meng Dong shook his head, looking at everyone with a gaze filled with disdain.

Everyone was extremely displeased. Any single one of them could be considered to have succeeded in “youth,” and someone was treating them with such disdain now. It would be strange if they did not feel displeased.

“I don’t mean to look down on you guys, but you people are truly a bunch of trash!” Meng Dong laughed loudly, turned around, and was just about to stride off.

“I’ll have a fight with you.” A voice suddenly rang out.

Meng Dong turned his head, and looked towards the speaker. Involuntarily, he was surprised. “A Second Tier? Haha, do you have confidence in yourself that is off the charts, or has your head been kicked by a donkey?”

Ling Han smiled calmly. “Aren’t you a Second Tier yourself as well?”

Previously, he had not spoken at all, because he was still comprehending those 15 Heavenly Venerable Seals, but thinking of how he was going to fight Meng Dong, he would definitely have to sever a few Heavenly Venerable Seals, so what was the need for him to go the extra mile?

Meng Dong was surprised. He couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “That’s right. I am indeed a Second Tier, but could it be that you did not see what happened just now? Even 10 Third Tiers joining forces are no match for me.”

Ling Han nodded. “I did see, which is why I think that you should be able to become my opponent.”

Meng Dong’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. Having cultivated to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, which one of them would have a head that was kicked silly by a donkey? Thus, Ling Han clearly knew that Meng Dong possessed strength that could suppress the Third Tier, yet still dared to challenge him, so he had to also be a supreme freakish genius himself.

“All right, come fight me!” Meng Dong casually tossed out 10 stone slabs sealed with Heavenly Venerable Seals. “The same rules, stakes of one to 10.”

“There is no need to take advantage of you; we’ll go with stakes of 10 to 10.” Ling Han also tossed out 10 stone slabs.

Everyone gave an oh, stunned by Ling Han’s generosity. Of course, there were also a few people that were secretly muttering that Ling Han was an idiot. He clearly could have gone with stakes of one to 10. However, what they did not know was that Ling Han was filled with confidence in himself, so what difference would there be for him to take out one or 10 seals?

“You’re very confident!” Meng Dong declared, his eyes narrowed.

“As humans, if we do not have confidence in ourselves… what meaning would there be left?” Ling Han countered.

“Haha, that’s right. One should have more confidence in themselves.” Meng Dong laughed loudly. “Let’s fight then.”

The two of them handed the Heavenly Venerable Seals over to Zhuang Bi, and then rose into the air, standing with a distance of 300 meters between them. For Heavenly Venerates, this bit of gap could be considered completely nonexistent. Just by raising their hand and delivering a strike, this distance could be breached.

“I hope you truly have some strength, and won’t disappoint me,” Meng Dong said.

“So do I!” Ling Han said.

“Then, get ready to face this strike.” Meng Dong moved, and delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han.

Peng!

As Ling Han exchanged a punch with him, a powerful shock wave surged out. Both of them retreated, and they were practically equal in strength.

In this instant, both their expressions became serious.

Their opponent’s power… was not inferior to their own!

Ling Han was stunned. Indeed, he was not the only one who could battle with a disadvantage of two cultivation levels. This Meng Dong’s freakish talent was actually superior to even the Empress’ because the Empress could not battle with a disadvantage of two cultivation levels.

However, what he did not know was that Meng Dong was even more shocked because Meng Dong’s cultivation level was peak-stage Second Tier.

Though it was hard to decide who was stronger between the two of them in this exchange, one of them was in the early stage of the Second Tier, yet the other was in the peak stage of the Second Tier. Was this not enough to show the problem?

“Interesting!” Meng Dong looked at Ling Han, fighting spirit burning hotly in his eyes. He already knew that he was slightly inferior to Ling Han, but he was not discouraged, because the clash between Heavenly Venerates was not a pure clash of cultivation level and power. The secret techniques and seals they had mastered were also a factor.

Hence, though the level of his power and Ling Han’s was presently equal, if he truly went all out, the gap would be abruptly widened.

Meng Dong had a resolute nature, and immediately channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal. At the same time, he was also channeling a secret technique. With a light roar, he took in a long, drawn-out breath, and the mystical power of heaven and earth was manipulated by him before spurting out violently.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Countless weapons shot out of his mouth, charging towards Ling Han in a barrage.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han’s face instantly darkened. He did not care whether Meng Dong had done it deliberately or otherwise, but wasn’t he spitting at him now?

...

A battle was a battle, so was it really appropriate of you to spit at your opponent like this?

“Bastard!” Ling Han roared in fury. He charged towards Meng Dong, and threw a punch, Fists of Fury already being deployed, as well as being boosted by the Fourteenth Seal, so his power increased to 29 times.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! Countless weapons were demolished by Ling Han, and he appeared to be invincible.

Meng Dong couldn’t help but feel stunned. This battle prowess was truly overbearing and vicious, and even he would have to dodge.

He was very decisive, and instantly retreated, refraining from a full-on confrontation with Ling Han. However, he was still nonstop spitting from his mouth. Golden swords, silver spears, halberds, daggers, and the like were all barraging Ling Han madly.

“To spit at your opponent to cause disgust, I have never seen someone as shameless as you,” Ling Han exclaimed angrily.

When these words fell, Meng Dong’s face darkened as well.

‘What do you mean by “spit at your opponent to cause disgust”?’

This was his Heavenly Venerate Technique—the Ten Thousand Weapons Technique, an ultimate technique that he had invented. He could use it without using his hands or legs, so it could be considered incredibly practical. Of course, if he spat too much, it was inevitable that a bit of saliva would be spurted out as well, but just how much was this amount?

Moreover, every single inch of skin and hair of a Heavenly Venerate was a supreme treasure, and saliva was greatly nutritious too. It was refreshingly fragrant like a Great Herb, so how could it be called disgusting?

“Damn you!” Meng Dong was also infuriated as well, spitting out saliva, no, spitting out weapons even more intensely.
