3035 Pleasure of Being Beaten

Ling Han highly doubted that Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was able to suddenly comprehend the technique of creating dimensions.

There was a great deal of luck involved in that; it was not something that could be achieved through comprehension ability alone.

Ling Han, for example, was only able to crack the code of life because he had the mysterious light in his body, which coincidentally resonated with Ning Haixin’s.

What did Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains have?

In addition, how was it possible for all five of these old bastards to suddenly experience a boost in their comprehension ability and simultaneously be enlightened on the technique of creating dimensions?

How was this possible?

As such, the most reasonable explanation was that the five of them had used some sort of method to divide the dimensions in Feng Wuding’s body among themselves.

Feng Wuding had 100 dimensions stored. If the five of them split it all equally, that meant that each of them would have 20 each.

There was a chance that some dimensions were lost in the process, and they were left with six each.

It was also possible that they had a falling out, and tried to fight one another for the dimensions, resulting in Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains being able to take only six.

Or maybe he was only able to utilize six dimensions in battle for the time being.

“Old bastard, what are you guys planning?” Ling Han said as he punched.

“Hahaha!” Even though Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had just been punched, he laughed. “Foolish boy. How can you possibly understand the grand scheme of things with your limited foresight? Both you and the light will return to dust and disappear from the world.”

Ling Han narrowed his eyes, and said, “Old bastard, you seem to know quite a few secrets!”

“Hmph, don’t think you can get anything out of me. That is just wishful thinking!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said coldly, no longer mentioning anything about the subject.

Despite Ling Han’s repeated attempts to probe for information, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s long years of experience ensured that he would not fall for such tricks.

Ling Han had no choice but to make his own conjectures, and then come up with assumptions based on the changes in Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s expression.

Even though he didn’t get any worthwhile information, Ling Han was not that invested in it to begin with.

He was purely here to give Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains a good beating.

What did it matter as long as he was happy?

Peng, peng, peng! For an entire hour, Ling Han happily beat up Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, venting all the frustration and anger he had pent up over the years.

After an hour, Ling Han finally ceased. With a wave of his hand, he said, “We’ll stop here for today, old man. We’ll pick things up next time.”

‘You still want a next time?’

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains roared in fury, and charged at Ling Han with all his might.

Ling Han lit up all of his seventh-grade seals again, bolstering his strength by 2,000 times once more. Peng, peng, peng! As he exchanged blows with Shatter Mountains, Ling Han continued to hold the upper hand as before, but this time he wasn’t able to suppress the former so easily.

Because of Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s immortal body, Ling Han was not able to suppress him, and thus only had a slight advantage in battle. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Old fool, you don’t have to send me off. I’ll come back to beat you up again!” Ling Han punched at Shatter Mountains, sending him flying before turning around and leaving.

“You damned brat!!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains quickly steadied his body and chased after Ling Han.

He was furious. There was no one in the world yet who could live after beating him up.

Ling Han laughed heartily. With a few steps, he arrived at the opening to the Void from before and stepped out. When Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains approached, Ling Han sent him flying backwards with another punch.

He then closed the gap into the Void. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains would need to spend quite a bit of time to find the exit now.

Ling Han then left the area cheerfully. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains could no longer tail him from here.

Ling Han then met with the others. When they heard that he had beaten Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains into a pulp, they all cheered with glee.

“Are we going after Chong Yan and the others next?” the large black dog asked excitedly.

“Aooo. Let’s go take their signboards too.” The old ginseng was also very eager. Judging by its looks, how was it possible to think that it had evolved from Celestial medicine?

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then said, “No, let’s not head over to Chong Yan’s place for now. I want to stay here and continue beating Shatter Mountains until he is traumatized.”

Everyone exchanged glances, thinking that Ling Han was a little sadistic.

‘How could you just take action against one person? Aren’t you afraid that Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains will start to question his own life from the abuse?’

As expected, after Ling Han was done charging the energy on his sixth-grade seals, he immediately went looking for Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

The old man was in seclusion at a location nearby his place of enlightenment. As such, Ling Han was able to quickly force Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains to show himself after making a mess of his place of enlightenment. He then brought Shatter Mountains into the Void, and gave him another beating.

Ling Han didn’t push Shatter Mountains too hard. After an hour or so, he casually left.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains could not do anything to stop him from leaving.

The cycle repeated itself. Ling Han found Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains a total of seven times, and each time he beat him up until he was satisfied.

This actually caused Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains to develop a trauma and start to question his life.

Naturally, he could run away. The world was so vast that even a Seventh Tier’s ability to locate someone had its limits.

However, his pride wouldn’t allow it. He was a highly regarded Seventh Tier. The only ones who should be running were the people who went up against him. How could he let himself be such a coward?

And because he was so prideful, he couldn’t avoid getting beaten up by Ling Han so many times.

The eighth time.

Ling Han appeared. Facing the vengeful gaze from Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, he laughed. “Old fool, are you starting to feel good from the physical abuse? I can’t believe you didn’t run away, and are actually waiting here for me. Sigh, I never thought you had such a fetish, old fool.”

“Don’t get so cocky, you little brat!!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains bellowed. “Once my Power of Dimension reaches the transcendent level, I will rip you to shreds!”

Ling Han scoffed. “Dream on! Don’t go thinking that you will suddenly achieve some monumental breakthrough just because you got a few dimensions from Feng Wuding. Transcendent dimension? That’s some imagination you have!

“Forget it. I can’t be bothered to beat up a pervert like you anymore. Today will be the last time. Otherwise, I’ll feel disgusted.”

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was furious. He was the one being beaten up here. How was he the pervert? How was he disgusting?

‘This little brat has such a venomous tongue!’

Shatter Mountains yelled as he released his full strength, eager to turn the tides for once. However, his hopes were destined to be dashed as he was quickly suppressed by Ling Han and beaten into a pulp like always.

After Ling Han was done pummeling Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, he said, “Old fool, you don’t have to look forward to this anymore. I won’t be coming back.”

‘No one is looking forward to this, you brat.’

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains cursed inwardly, but he also felt a faint sense of relief that he would no longer have to suffer Ling Han’s physical abuse.

Even though his physique was indestructible, he still needed to save face.

“Just you wait, brat. I’ll remember this. I will definitely get you back for it!” he said in defiance. He had to show some attitude, otherwise even he would feel bad for himself.

“If it’s next time… things won’t be this easy!” Ling Han said calmly. After beating up Shatter Mountains several times, his mood greatly improved, and he felt as though even the barrier between cultivation levels grew a little less tight.

Perhaps after beating up all five of the old bastards, he would be able to break through to the Sixth Tier.

When that happened, his dimensions would be able to ascend to high-tier high-level dimensions, boosting his strength many times.

‘Seventh Tier?

‘Nothing but a bunch of ants.’

“Old fool, while you still have a few days to live, you should enjoy the little freedom you have left. Because after this… you will only be my prisoner!”

Ling Han turned around then left as Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains stared at his silhouette from behind.
