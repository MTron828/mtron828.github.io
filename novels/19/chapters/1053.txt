Chapter 1054: Conceited

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han didn’t take him to heart. It was this person who had acted hostile and spoken in provocation first. As such, what did it matter if he taunted him back?

He had an official rank now, so as long as he didn’t do anything treasonous, even powerful figures like the Seven Generals and the Left and Right Minister couldn’t target him openly. This being the case, why would he still need to tolerate this stupid retard?

Jiu Wuqi didn’t relent, and even raised his finger to point at Ling Han. “Brat, what are you trying to say?!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Pointing at others is very disrespectful, do you understand?”

Jiu Wuqi was infuriated. ‘You f*cking called me an idiot, yet you still have the face to label me as disrespectful?’

He humphed, and said, “Don’t think that you can act all arrogant just because you’ve become a little famous recently. Don’t forget that this is the Imperial Capital. We live right under the empress’ throne where there are countless prodigies and supreme elites!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Is that so? Then are you a prodigy, or are you a supreme elite?”

“Humph! I’m only 30,000 years old, yet I’m already a Level Two Alchemist! Moreover, I’ll be able to become a Level Three Alchemist in no time at all!” Jiu Wuqi wore a proud expression as he spoke.

‘Is this person a stupid pig?’

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel puzzled. He had started from scratch, but could already refine Level Three Divine Pills now. Although he could only refine one type, one’s alchemy level was simply based on the highest level pill one could refine. This was a publicly recognized system.

‘This person is still a Level Two Alchemist even though he’s already practiced alchemy for 30,000 years? And he still needs some time to reach Level Three? How can he be considered a genius?

‘But he doesn’t look like a dumb c*nt...

‘So, it turns out that my talent in alchemy is actually this amazing?!’

Ling Han could only conclude that his talent was too impressive.

A smug smile appeared on Jiu Wuqi’s face as he thought that it was him who had caused Ling Han to become speechless.

In the alchemy world on the Joint Peace Planet, those who became Level One Alchemists before turning 3,000 years old and those who became Level Two Alchemists before being 10,000 years old could all be considered geniuses. Meanwhile, Jiu Wuqi was about to become a Level Three Alchemist, and doing so at the age of only 30,000 years was even more stunning than the previous two feats.

In addition, his talent in cultivation was also outstanding—he had already reached the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier.

These were the foundations of his pride and arrogance.

Jiu Wuqi humphed, and said, “So, don’t think that you can act all high and mighty just because you’ve achieved a small feat. Compared to me, you’re absolutely nothing!”

Ling Han finally came to a realization. This person was the type who was extremely conceited and narrow-minded, and couldn’t tolerate anyone being more talented than them.

He shook his head, not wanting to speak any more nonsense with this sort of person. He turned to Gu Lingyu, and said, “Let’s not make your master wait for too long.”

“Mm-hm!” Gu Lingyu nodded, and they immediately left.

Jiu Wuqi almost collapsed in anger. ‘Why are both of these people looking down on me?’

He hurriedly caught up to them, and said, “Brat, you’re only at the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier! You should know how expensive and scarce alchemical pills are, right? However, if you can become my friend, you’ll never need to worry about obtaining alchemical pills in the future!”

Ling Han chuckled in his mind, and said, “Then how can I become your friend?”

“Hehehe!” Jiu Wuqi instantly started laughing, thinking that Ling Han had finally bowed down to him. “It’s easy. Just call me big brother in the future. Also, Junior Sister Gu is mine, so don’t even think about trying to get together with her!”

He lowered his voice on his last sentence so that only Ling Han could hear him.

‘What a narrow-minded person. He can’t bear seeing others more talented and impressive than him?’

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Someone who’s truly talented doesn’t need to boast to others. You’re far from being talented, so stop embarrassing yourself before others. Also, I don’t think that you’re worthy of Lady Gu.”

“Damn it!” Jiu Wuqi’s embarrassment turned into anger, and he said, “Brat, don’t be too full of yourself! You’ve successfully angered me, so I can guarantee that no pharmacy in the Imperial Capital will sell you any alchemical pills! Not even a single pill!”

Ling Han’s expression became quite strange. Jiu Wuqi was still completely unaware that he had opened his own pharmacy.

‘Oh, Jiu Wuqi isn’t wrong, either. It’s my own pharmacy anyway, so that doesn’t count as “selling”.’

“Heh, I’m so terrified!” Ling Han said with a smile.

Although Jiu Wuqi was conceited, he could still read others’ expressions just fine. He knew that Ling Han was teasing him, and his expression became even darker.

‘Humph! This brat will understand how extremely stupid it is to offend an alchemist when he walks around with True Origin Stones yet fails to buy any alchemical pill!’

He decided to follow Ling Han and Gu Lingyu, a cold smirk on his face.

Gu Lingyu was an absolute idiot when it came to worldly matters, and she still hadn’t realized that Ling Han and Jiu Wuqi were already completely at odds with each other. She continued to lead the way, and it wasn’t long before they arrived in a small garden.

“Master,” she called respectfully.

She had said master and not teacher—these were two completely different concepts.

However, Ling Han was a little stumped. ‘Where’s her master?’

The garden wasn’t big, and he could see everything at a glance. However, he couldn’t see a fourth person anywhere.

A delicate shout traveled over. “Kid, where are you looking?”

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han lowered his head, only to see a woman sitting cross-legged on the petal of a flower.

How large was the petal of a flower?

She was as small as a thumb, with her body only being an inch or so tall. Strangely, there was also a pair of extremely thin wings on her back. They were almost transparent, yet they were still adorned with golden thread-like patterns that were incredibly thin.

‘Is this Yan Xiaoxuan, Gu Lingyu’s master and the Deputy Head of the Alchemy Institution?’

Ling Han could barely believe his eyes. “Senior, are you...”

“What, are you looking down on me because of my small stature?” Yan Xiaoxuan was displeased, and she instantly unleashed an aura that was unique to elites.

She was definitely at the Sun Moon Tier, though it was impossible for Ling Han to judge her exact cultivation as she hadn’t summoned her Sun or Moon.

“No, I would never dare to!” Ling Han replied hurriedly. “I’m just a bit surprised.” He spoke exactly what he thought.

It was best to remain honest before such elites.

Sure enough, Yan Xiaoxuan laughed heartily, and said, “I’m half-human and half-Dream Spirit Tribe.”

Half-humans were the offspring between humans and Demonic Beasts who could shapeshift. They possessed characteristics of both humans and Demonic Beasts, and they would also inherit the bloodline of both of their parents. Generally speaking, they were more adaptable than their parents.

Ling Han bowed, and said, “Ling Han pays his respects to Senior Yan!” This was an act of respect toward elites.

Yan Xiaoxuan accepted his greeting, then raised her hand, and said, “No need for the formalities! I called you over to ask whether you want to join our Alchemy Institution or not.”

Pu! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jiu Wuqi instantly choked and spluttered. ‘What on earth is happening?’

If the Alchemy Institution wanted to recruit people, they could simply make an announcement in the Imperial Capital. People would definitely apply in droves.

Alchemy was a transcendent occupation, and the status of an alchemist was a level above that of cultivators at the same level. This was a publicly acknowledged fact.

It was because of this that Jiu Wuqi acted so conceited and felt so good about himself.

But what now? Yan Xiaoxuan had actually called Ling Han over and personally asked him whether he wanted to join the Alchemy Institution. This naturally scared Jiu Wuqi to death.

The Alchemy Institution was extremely strict when it came to recruiting students. In fact, it was tens or even hundreds of times more strict than the four major institutions! The four major institutions could recruit several hundred students every 20 years, but what about the Alchemy Institution? It would be considered decent if they could recruit one student every 100 years.

This was because students recruited into the Alchemy Institution would generally form traditional master and disciple relationships. Thus, the alchemy grandmasters would all be extremely careful when selecting students. They would rather have fewer disciples than have untalented or immoral disciples.

Since when had the Alchemy Institution become this unreserved?
