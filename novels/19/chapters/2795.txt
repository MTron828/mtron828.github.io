2796 Contending for the Heavenly Venerable Seal

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Instantly, over a dozen people rushed out at the same time, bursting down into the ground.

Everyone knew that the Heavenly Venerable Seal had indeed come into existence, but it was also precisely due to this that there was no way that it could last for a very long time. Very soon, it would shatter and disappear.

Hence, they had to dive underground to catch a glimpse of the true appearance of the Heavenly Venerable Seal.

No one knew how long this seal would be able to last, so they had to be quick.

Ling Han, the Empress, Zhuang Feirui, and the others were among them. They continuously advanced further underground, searching for the true location of the Heavenly Venerable Seal.

However, the farther they progressed, the greater the pressure ahead of them would be. It was like they were ordinary people that had entered into a swamp, and every step was tremendously difficult.

Peng, peng, peng! As they rushed onwards, they were still fighting madly. The Heavenly Venerable Seal had already come into being, and only one person could attain it. Hence, they had to contend with one another now. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

No matter who you were, they definitely would not give in.

Boom!

Zhuang Feirui attacked Ling Han. He considered Ling Han as his strongest opponent.

With a kick, Ling Han sent the other man flying, but quickly after, he let out a soft exclamation of surprise.

The dimension had reestablished itself again. This time, it had become the fourth spatial level.

“Ling Han, it’s my turn now!” Zhuang Feirui erupted in loud laughter as he charged towards Ling Han. He naturally could feel that his power had recovered—at least to the Third Tier.

He charged back, and he instantly suppressed Ling Han completely with a spike of power.

Of course, it was not the time to clear debts now. After Zhuang Feirui sent Ling Han flying, he rushed forwards once more.

‘Huh?

Only after rushing a few steps forwards, he frowned. That was because space had reestablished itself again.

Ling Han charged over, suppressing him.

However, Ling Han only managed to advance a short length forwards, and the suppression of the dimension was once again relaxed to the fourth level.

Ling Han shook his head. It was not that space kept reestablishing itself, but rather that this was where the second and fourth spatial level had collided. They contained parts of one another, and that was the reason for this situation.

Zhuang Feirui and Ling Han battled endlessly. Sometimes, it would be Zhuang Feirui who had the upper hand; at other times, it would be Ling Han. The two of them continuously exchanged positions of advantage and disadvantage. It was completely dependent on the spatial level they were in.

However, everyone’s progress was slowing down further and further. The pressure here was really too frightening. Who knew the extent of souls, blood, and flesh of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates that became the center which had nurtured a Heavenly Venerable Seal. How could it be so easy to come close to it?

From the weaker to the stronger, everyone stopped one after another.

Geng Xuandan stopped, Shi Zhonghe stopped, Shi Mengyu stopped, the Empress stopped.

…Even as strong as the Empress was, it could not be helped. She only had Second-Tier power, after all, so there was no way she could match a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Only Zhuang Feirui and Ling Han were left. They were both struggling to advance forwards; at the same time, they were still clashing, so their progress was even further slowed.

Would they really… be able to make it to the end, and who would make it there first?

Ling Han and Zhuang Feirui battled intensely. They were already continuously penetrating deeper underground. A sea of blood had appeared ahead of them, and there was a golden seal that was glowing at the bottom of this sea of blood. However, it was being weighed down by a massive boulder. Thus, only about half of it could be seen.

‘Kill!’

Ling Han and Zhuang Feirui battled even more intensely. They were using all the means at their disposal to send the other man flying so that they would be able to take this Heavenly Venerable Seal for their own.

And now, what mattered was actually not which of them was stronger, but rather who had the better luck.

…Would the space closest to the Heavenly Venerable Seal be the second level or the fourth level?

The two of them rushed forwards. Both of them knew that anyone could turn over that giant rock, and that Heavenly Venerable Seal would emerge, but at the same time, it would also immediately disappear. Only one person could obtain this seal, and that would be the first person who could displace the rock.

They were close, and they had reached it!

They had already arrived at the side of the giant rock, and Zhuang Feirui’s expression immediately changed drastically.

F***, this was actually the second spatial level.

Peng! He had not even finished the thought when Ling Han had already sent him flying with a single kick.

He released a battle cry filled with defiance. Why? Why? Why?

Ling Han flipped the great rock over resolutely. This seal was already beginning to shatter. It would not take too long before it disappeared completely. He definitely had to be decisive, and could not waste any time. Taking the Empress and the others here to study it together was completely unrealistic.

Boom! Boundless golden light blazed brilliantly, surging to the top of Ling Han’s head, and then sank in.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The light surged continuously, and the seal vanished in a mere instant, and so did the golden light.

Ling Han immediately felt the frightening corrosion assault him, and he quickly rushed into the air.

Peng! He burst through the ground layers and out of the underground. His whole body was covered with injuries, his skin corroding, and the corrosion was still continuously spreading.

Ling Han quickly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to oppose it, and the corrosion immediately stopped. However, once he stopped channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, the corrosion would also continue, so there was no way he could be careless.

The Empress and the others hurriedly gathered around him, and asked about his condition.

“I’m fine.” Ling Han nodded. He was only sustaining the corrosive power of the Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. He only needed some time, and he would definitely be able to get rid of it.

Peng! Zhuang Feirui also charged out from below the ground. He was not much better, as there were multiple holes all over his body.

He glared harshly at Ling Han. Ling Han had already obtained the Heavenly Venerable Seal, and unless he could forcefully extract it from him, there was absolutely no way he could obtain it.

However, everyone was fighting Hysteria now, so who would dare commit such a great crime now?

“Humph!” With a flutter of his sleeve, he charged out of the ground crevice and in a different direction. Since he could no longer obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal, he would then kill all those anomalies to vent his anger.

Ling Han did not move. He was sure that there was no way Zhuang Feirui could do it, because he had also been corroded by the power of the Heavenly Venerates inside the sea of blood, and would need to expend a lot of power to suppress the corrosion. Going by that account, if someone said Zhuang Feirui could still fight against around 100 Third Tier Heavenly Venerates, Ling Han would not believe it.

“Let’s go back,” Ling Han said. This time, he had really reaped abundant rewards.

Even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate would be tempted by a Heavenly Venerable Seal. In fact, even a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate would be interested. Every additional Heavenly Venerable Seal meant additional battle prowess. Why shouldn’t they take it?

The Empress drew Ling Han into the Celestial Guest Residence. Ling Han’s present condition was not suitable for battle. He still had to take a good rest.

...

With the Empress, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and other powerful characters leading the way, the group successfully left the Black Waterfall Mountain, and returned to the true second spatial level. Here, the Empress’s battle prowess could be considered top-tier. She would not fear anyone’s challenge.

After returning to base camp, Ling Han concentrated on recuperation.

There were too many powers of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates and their resentment, and he would have to get rid of them one by one. Hence, after spending around 100 years, Ling Han finally recovered completely.

He came out of seclusion, and the Empress filled him in on the recent events.

What was the most ground-breaking was naturally the fact that he had obtained a complete Heavenly Venerable Seal.

This was something that even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate would covet. Who knew if Ling Han would disappear forever when he left the Realm Battlefield one day… captured by an elite so that they could extract the Heavenly Venerable Seal from him.

Of course, it was definite that Ling Han was not the only one to obtain a Heavenly Venerable Seal, but no one would speak out about this kind of thing. Who would publicize it like with Ling Han?

The second event was Zhuang Feirui’s return. He had once been the greatest prodigy of the fourth level, and not only had he not died now, he had even advanced to the Fourth Tier. This was a very great piece of good news. It was said that even the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates had been alerted, and a decree was issued to praise Zhuang Feirui for his feat.
