Chapter 1660: It’s my turn, right?

Ling Han had not walked back too long when he encountered a group from the Zhao Tribe.

When they discovered the “Destroyer”, the Zhao Tribe had also resolutely given up their plans of attacking the Lang Tribe. Instead, they communicated with the Lang Tribe, and the two great tribes sent out their own elites to search for Xiao Gu in this expansive area.

...As for Ling Han, he was an extra, and could be killed as they liked.

In the ancestral teachings of every tribe, there were instructions regarding the Destroyer, and that was to kill it at all costs.

There were a total of 10 people in this group from the Zhao Tribe, with a Nine Rings elite leading the team. When he discovered Ling Han, he was startled at first. He had not thought that he could strut right out in front of them.

Thus, that Nine Rings elite faltered for a moment. Only then did he release a battle cry, sending out a summoning signal.

Ling Han did not stop him. That would be just right for him, having all of them gather so he could kill them all in one go.

Not too long later, multiple figures shot out and arrived. They were all Nine Rings elites, and there were more of them that were Seven or Eight Rings elites that were rushing towards them from all directions. However, they had not come to encircle and annihilate Ling Han and Xiao Gu, but were helping out in the search.

“Very good. He knows he can’t escape, so he has come out to meet his death!” an elder from the Zhao Tribe exclaimed, his expression livid.

Meanwhile, Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he smilingly said, “Not everyone is here yet, so let’s just wait a while longer!”

“Ridiculous!” An elite moved, his Spiritual Power condensing to form a black-colored giant elephant, which charged out to crush Ling Han.

He was an elite of the Lang Tribe, and had never exchanged blows with Ling Han before. As he saw it, this kind of minor character would naturally be suppressed with a single palm strike from him.

Ling Han’s figure flashed and dodged this blow. He calmly said, “I have always been a reasonable man, and will always give others the opportunity to choose. Now, those that are not willing to become my enemy can immediately retreat. Otherwise, when I make my move, those that are still here... are all my enemies!’

The members of the Lang Tribe and Zhao Tribe all sneered. For someone who was only the equivalent of the late stage of Nine Rings, he still dared to boast so shamelessly.

“I will also give you a choice. Kneel down and kowtow 100 times, and I can spare your lowly life,” that elite from the Lang Tribe declared coldly.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Do you know that you are very irritating??”

He flicked a finger, and xiu, a flash of sword light shot out. Its speed was astonishingly fast, and before anyone managed to react, it had come out through the back of the head of that elite from the Lang Tribe.

This elite of the Lang Tribe wore a completely vacant expression, his eyes rapidly becoming dim. Pa, he collapsed onto the ground, fresh blood gushing out from him. He was already dead.

Gasp!

Instantly, there was a dead silence. This was a peak stage Nine Rings elite, yet he was actually insta-killed with a single strike. T-t-t-this was too terrifying! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

How could this be? Clearly, only the man with green light was the Destroyer. They only had to kill him before he could get strong enough. Why was this guy even more frightening?

Everyone couldn’t help but take a step back, and there were some that were more cowardly that were already screaming sharply, breaking into a run.

Ling Han’s eyes were cold. He had already given these people a chance.

‘Since you guys want to kill me, then you would have to be prepared to be counter-killed. How could there be something so good in this world?’

He flicked his finger repeatedly. Multiple flashes of Sword Qi danced out, and the members of the Zhao and Lang Tribe collapsed one after another.

“Gather together!” an elite shouted loudly. This reminded all of them, and they all gathered together, but in this process, at least half of them died.

“Impossible!” The elders from the Zhao Tribe all gasped. “10 days ago, he had still been forced to flee from our pursuit. How has he become so powerful now?”

The members of the Lang Tribe wanted to cry. They should not have gotten involved in this messy situation. What business was it of theirs? Now, what were they supposed to do?

All the elites joined forces, and finally managed to block Ling Han’s attacks. There were about 20 peak stage Nine Rings elites, and this was still very effective.

And there were others rushing here. When the chiefs of the Lang Tribe and Zhao Tribe arrived together, everyone finally felt relief. They felt as if their pillar of support was here, and calmed down greatly.

“This brat!!” The Zhao Tribe chief saw the corpses littered all over the ground, and his expression involuntarily became livid. At least half of them were elites from the Zhao Tribe, yet now they had all been eliminated. In future, putting aside the question of replacing the Lang Tribe, they could even be overthrown by the tribes from the middle course.

He shouted loudly. Boom

, he drew all the power of the tribe into his body, madly increasing his battle prowess. Multiple black patterns surged out from his body, forming many black chains.

“Die!” he roared loudly. Those black chains immediately moved, shooting rapidly towards Ling Han, and intending to punch right through his body.

Ling Han didn’t even bother to dodge, and allowed these chains to hit him.

Ding, ding, ding, ding. When the metal chains struck him, only multiple sparks were created from the friction. They were unable to wound him the slightest bit.

‘What?!’

The elites from the two tribes who had just soothed their military morale once again experienced having their hearts drop to rock bottom. Such a powerful attack did not even manage to penetrate Ling Han’s defenses; this was practically enough to destroy all their hopes.

The Zhao Tribe chief gritted his teeth, and the metal chains suddenly wrapped tightly around Ling Han like snakes. Winding round and round, soon enough only Ling Han’s head was left visible.

Though they had a different cultivation system, they similarly had to accumulate Spiritual Power and their appreciation of great dao. The difference was that what they comprehended was not the Regulations of the Ancient Realm, but rather the Regulations flowing in that great river at the side.

Those chains were formed by the Regulations that he had comprehended, and had reached the peak stage of Nine Rings. He was sure that Ling Han definitely could not possibly struggle free.

Who asked this brat to be too arrogant?

“Move quickly, I have trapped him!” the Zhao Tribe chief called out loudly.

“Charge!” The Lang Tribe chief and the elites of the two tribes moved at the same time, charging towards Ling Han. At this time, the threat that Ling Han posed had already exceeded Xiao Gu, and he definitely had to be killed.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu released a furious roar. It, too, charged out.

Meanwhile, the Notionless Saint and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden did not move. Firstly, they would only be going to their deaths if they did, and secondly, they were filled with confidence in Ling Han. Since he had done this, he definitely had enough certainty to succeed.

About 40 peak stage Nine Rings elites charged, all using their strongest attacks, which they barraged Ling Han with.

Ling Han broke into a grin. How many peak stage Saint Kings had there been in that heavenly tribulation previously? Their number had exceeded the tribes’ ranks by who knew how many times, yet hadn’t he still dealt with them easily?

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Innumerable attacks poured out, and even the earth itself was shaking. If it were not for the fact that this was very likely a part of the Celestial Realm, this earth could not possibly have sustained such an impact. Even so, there were still copious amounts of dust and soil flying, covering the skies.

They blasted Ling Han for at least 10 breaths’ time, and some of them finally slowly stopped. When the last person also stopped attacking, the dust gradually settled, and their sight became clear again.

However, when they could see clearly, everyone was close to despair.

...Ling Han was still tied up in the chains, yet looked completely at ease. If it wasn’t for the fact that the chains wrapped around him were extremely damaged, who would believe that he had been simultaneously attacked by 40 Nine Rings elites just moments ago?

“It’s my turn, right?” Ling Han asked smilingly. He moved lightly, and the chains entrapping him broke apart.

He stood there in his black clothes, elegant and confident.
