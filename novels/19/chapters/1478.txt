Chapter 1479 Victory Again

At the last moment, Ling Han still withdrew some of the formations’ might. Otherwise, this attack would not simply cause injury, but would crush Jia Liang into dust.Combining these 10 killing formations as one did not simply increase their might by 10 times, but boosted their might a hundredfold!

Jia Liang groaned. He felt that all the bones in his body had been broken, and he could not get to his feet at all.

Ling Han walked over, and looked down on him. Then he squatted down beside Jia Liang’s head, and said, “Senior Brother Jia, you have not said it yet. Why have you called me over? Sigh, you are already quite old, so why are you still so hot-tempered and quick to anger? Can’t we talk things out politely?”

‘I, f***!’

Jia Liang spat out a mouthful of blood and coughed endlessly as he pointed at Ling Han. If one could kill with a glare, Ling Han would definitely have been ripped into pieces.

He was furious. Previously, Ling Han did not call him senior brother at all, and now, though he did, was that respecting him? This was absolutely a slap in his face!

It was common knowledge that leaving a line in everything would allow for better relations in future. Going so far, were you planning to become the public enemy of the whole academy?

“In future, don’t just casually talk about violence and murder, be good!” Ling Han patted Jia Liang’s face, and then stood up. He still had to go and listen to the Tranquil Heart Saint’s seminar.

The large black dog quickly ran behind him, but after taking a few steps, he couldn’t help but turn back around and come back. He raised one of his back legs beside Jia Liang’s head, and a spray of liquid suddenly spewed out.

As the saying went, a leopard could not change its spots. This involuntary action of leaving a mark when he met a target was also a habit that was embedded in his blood.

Only then did the large black dog chase after Ling Han in satisfaction, but then he realized that he was a great elite. What elite would be prancing around on all four legs? Immediately, he stood on his back paws, and walked like he was a human.

Jia Liang was too pitiful. He spat out a successive 13 mouthfuls of blood, his legs stretched out, and he passed out.

Actually, Ling Han had seen the dog’s action, but did not stop him.

Firstly, this was none of his business. Secondly, he had not trifled with anyone, and it was Jia Liang himself who had approached to ask for a beating. He had merely sought his own humiliation.

“Little Black, you are really despicable!” Ling Han said sincerely. The Old Ginseng and the Rabbit were only rookies in front of this large black dog.

“This is how I am. If you dare say another word about me being despicable, Grandpa Dog will get angry with you!” The large black dog swept an eye over Ling Han’s neck. “Little Han, will you truly not consider becoming my mount? I can teach you supreme cultivation techniques!”

“Get lost!” Ling Han shot out a foot in a kick, but the large black dog was incredibly intelligent. With a leap, he had long since dodged the attempted blow.

The man and dog left boldly and openly.

At first, it was a complete silence, but then a world-shaking uproar exploded.

“My heavens, Senior Brother Jia lost!”

“And furthermore, it’s a terrible defeat!”

“How could this be possible? Senior Brother Jia is in the late stage of the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and furthermore, has inscribed the Yinyang Five Element Formation in his body. How could he possibly be no match for a Heavenly Body Tier?”

“Even if I saw it with my own eyes, I do not dare believe it at all!”

“Could it be that the senior brothers in the high extreme would have to move out?”

Everyone looked at each other, and suddenly had a feeling that even if those in the high extreme came, it was not certain that they would be able to suppress him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They went off in all directions, hurriedly bringing this astonishing news to even more people. Ling Han had really rocketed into the skies. Even one in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier could not suppress him.

Ling Han and the large black dog had arrived at the public square in the center of the academy. There was a stage as tall as nine meters in the middle of the public square. There was no one on the stage, but the area around it was already fully occupied.

The Tranquil Heart Saint had not arrived yet, and the seminar had not begun.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. He had thankfully not missed it.

“Little Black, you seem to be doing quite well around here?” he asked the large black dog. This despicable dog had not been taken in by any Saint, but he had seen him make trouble in the academy quite a few times, and no one had actually stepped out to discipline him.

Xiu, with a flash, he had dodged a sudden bite from the large black dog.

The large black dog humphed, and declared, “Call me Grandpa Black! Grandpa Black, got it?”

Ling Han merely chuckled, and pretended he had not heard him.

“I am the auspicious sign of heaven and earth, and am loved by all who see me.” The large black dog boasted shamelessly.

Ling Han really wanted to deliver a kick right at him. He called himself loved by all who saw him? If he was really tossed out, those who wanted to kill him could form a long queue that could wind a good few times around Wood Figure Planet.

In only a while, a sudden commotion began among the gathered masses. They whispered furiously to one another, all looking stunned or wearing expressions of disbelief.

With Ling Han’s ears, he naturally could hear everything clearly. They were all discussing what had happened just now—how he had seriously wounded Jia Liang with a single blow.

“That’s got to be fake, how could that be possible?”

“That’s right, Senior Brother Jia is in the late stage of the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and furthermore, he has grasped the Yinyang Five Element Formation. To defeat him, one would have to be at the peak of the medium extreme, at least, what more to defeat him with a single strike. Only one in the early stage of the high extreme would be able to do that.”

“Don’t tell me that a Heavenly Body Tier could possess the battle prowess of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier. I wouldn’t believe that even if it killed me.”

“It is absolutely impossible! Even if he had a Saint Tool, it would still be impossible. Limited by cultivation level, Heavenly Body Tiers definitely could not possibly force too much might out from a Saint Tool.”

Everyone was shaking their head. At first, they were stunned, but what quickly followed was doubt. Not a single person believed it—even those that had witnessed the scene with their own eyes were doubting what they had seen, what more when they were just finding out from hearsay.

“Ling, Ling Han is over there!” someone exclaimed suddenly, pointing at Ling Han.

Ling Han had not hidden himself, and was just openly standing right there, so he was naturally eye-grabbing.

Everyone’s eyes were attracted by this pointing gesture.

What did the fact that Ling Han had appeared mean?

It meant that Jia Liang had definitely failed to snipe him.

Gasp!

Could it be that the “rumor” was true? Ling Han had really defeated Jia Liang?

Xiu, a figure directly flew into the skies above Ling Han. There was a galaxy winding around behind him, exuding an endless aura. This was an elite in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and was also one of the strongest few in the public square.

For those big shots like Ren Feiyun and elites of the high extreme of Eternal River Tier, they represented the strongest battle prowess of the eighth campus, so they had naturally received favorable treatment from the Tranquil Heart Saint. Usually, they would be called over, and be taught Formation Dao of a higher level.

In this kind of general seminar, those big shots and supreme elites would not be coming. That was because they would not benefit much even if they did. They had already grasped this knowledge millions of years ago.

“I do not believe that you are able to defeat Jia Liang; take a blow from me!” The man did not say another word, and immediately made his move. He stretched out a finger, which formed into a golden spear that swung with suppressive force down on Ling Han. He seemed like he was intending to pierce Ling Han right through.

Ling Han was irritated. He clenched a fist and brazenly greeted the incoming blow with his own attack.

Peng!

The 10 killing formations showed their weight. An endless murderous aura surged out, capable of piercing a hole in the sky itself.

It was as if that man was made out of paper. He was sent flying by the force, blood spewing madly from his mouth. Wherever his blood landed, there was a commotion. This was the blood of the Eternal River Tier. A single drop was heavier than even a mountain, and more so brought with it his boundless life essence, so its destructive ability was incredibly frightening.

Boom, the man collapsed on the ground foaming from his mouth, his limbs twitching slightly.

An uproar erupted.
