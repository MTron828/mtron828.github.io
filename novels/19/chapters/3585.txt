Chapter 3586: Driven away

Translator. Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Two-faced!

Everyone was commenting on Ling Han. Just look, he was so scared by you that he automatically forfeited, and you are still unwilling to let it go. How could anyone be that harsh?

Niu Jianhua retreated to the very end. He directly turned around and left, planning to leave the Primordial Sect.

Becoming a disciple of the Primordial Sect?

How could he have that kind of interest? He had only come here to participate in the battle because he wanted to obtain the Star Origin Fruit, and now that he no longer had the chance to get first place, what was the point of him staying any longer?

Hold on!

He Stopped. If he didn’t stay behind in the Primordial Sect, how would he know when Ling Han would leave?

He definitely had to kill this person.

Hence, he had to stay in the Primordial Sect, and stand guard over Ling Han. When Ling Han left, he would follow quietly, and have his four servants apprehend Ling Han. He would have a good interrogation, and torture him a bit more, before finally killing Ling Han.

He actually dared to toy with him?

Did he know who he was!

Niu Jianhua did not leave, and returned to his original position, watching the battle quietly.

The battles continued. Liu Huayun and Sima Huai took the field respectively, both of them easily obtaining a victory. There were actually not that many one-star geniuses. They could be considered the cream of the crop.

Ling Han’s eyes focused on a young man in black. He was Liu Jun, the Primordial True Lord’s third disciple.

Being able to become the disciple of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, Liu Jun’s natural talent was naturally extraordinary. He was definitely a one-star genius. Moreover, he had to be one of the stronger ones among one-star geniuses.

The moment he appeared, even that Foundation Building elite was very polite, and faced him with a smile, giving him enough face.

Previously, this guy had put on such airs, yet now, he was practically bootlicking, which highlighted the strength of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, making a Celestial Path elite bow down to a mortal.

The first round of battles had ended, and stronger prodigies had naturally emerged victorious, and among the one-star geniuses, the only one who had not advanced into the second round was Niu Jianhua.

Because it was already late, the second round of the competition would be held tomorrow, so everyone dispersed first.

Niu Jianhua had just set out, when he was stopped, and told to wait.

in a short while, a grey-robed elder appeared. Strangely, his body was actually semi-transparent.

“True Self Tier!” Niu Jianhua’s expression changed drastically.

Though the Niu Clan had old servants of True Self Tier, they definitely could not deny the strength of a True Self Tier. Furthermore, this was not the Hundred Victory Planet. If he was really killed by the other, even if the ancestor of his clan arrived, it was still uncertain whether he could make the Primordial True Lord lower his head and submit, and hand over the culprit.

Thus, it would be best for him to be more respectful.

“Greetings, Senior!” he clasped his hands and said.

This True Self Tier cultivator was called Tong Yue. He nodded, putting on airs, and then asked, “Where are you from?”

Niu Jianhua hesitated slightly, then decided to tell the truth, “I come from the Hundred Victory Planet, Star Dragon Sect, and my ancestor is Niu Fang.

“So you are a descendant of True Lord Niu.” Tong Yue gave an ‘oh’. No wonder this brat could nurture weapons. As it turned out, he had come from another planet.

“Senior recognizes my ancestor?” Niu Jianhua was also slightly surprised. Could he ask the other party to move, and apprehend Ling Han?

Tong Yue smiled, “I have indeed not seen him, but I have heard of the great reputation of the True Lord Niu.

There was no friendship between them then.

Niu Jianhua sighed internally. Since there was no friendship between them, what basis did they have to give him, a mere Mystery Realm Tier, face?

-Since you are a descendant of the True Lord Niu, the Primordial Sect would not dare to take you as disciple. You may go now.” Tong Yue waved him off.

■F*ck! You’re chasing me away?’

Niu Jianhua was stunned for a moment. Hadn’t they agreed that those who made it into the top 32 would be disciples of the Primordial Sect? Why had he been chased off just like that?

But Tong Yue also had his own ideas. A descendant of a Spirit Transformation True Lord was staying in his own sect; what if something happened?

Niu Fang could still be blocked by the Primordial True Lord, but what if Niu Fang enlisted the help of elites of the Star Dragon Sect?

If a great elite of Sect Master-level descended, the Primordial Sect could only be destroyed with a single palm strike.

Right now, they still wanted to keep a low profile. They didn’t want to attract elites at the Sect Master-level or even Venerate Tier-level, so they could complete their plans. Thus, it was best for Niu Jianhua to return as soon as possible. Otherwise, he might be killed.

How could Niu Jianhua change the mind of a True Self Tier elite?

Helpless, he could only leave the sect.

“Young Master!” The four Foundation Building old servants all leaped out and paid their respects to Niu Jianhua.

“Congratulations, Young Master, for obtaining the Treasured Fruit and laying a firmer foundation. The great dao is within reach!” An old man was in a rush to curry favor, but didn’t he see how dark Niu Jianhua’s expression was at this moment?

“Congratulations your sister!” Niu Jianhua shot out a kick. “Young Master-” The other three old men were all stunned. How could it be that they had not managed to curry his favour?

The old man did not dare to dodge, nor did he dare to fight back, and allowed Niu Jianhua to kick him there.

After venting his anger, Niu Jianhua finally explained the reason.

“What, that little b@stard is actually the criminal that sneak attacked Young Master and robbed you?”

“This b@stard actually followed us all the way here. Doesn’t that mean that he has been secretly mocking us all this while?”

“This is really too despicable!”

“I already said, that brat can’t be trusted!”

The fourth old man gave a piece of belated advice, which instantly caused Niu Jianhua to explode in fury, and beat him up.

For some people, even if they stepped onto the Celestial Path, they would still be retarded.

“Young Master, what should we do now?”

Niu Jianhua pondered for a moment, “I originally planned to monitor Can Ye in the sect, and capture him once he left the sect, but from the look of things now, we have to spread out and guard the few paths that lead out of the mountain.”

“Young Master is wise!” The four old men began to curry favor again. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Can Ye… I will definitely not spare you!”

To say nothing of Niu Jianhua, the night passed. Ling Han faced the rising sun to cultivate. Then, after breakfast, he went to the plaza in front of the Tai Yi Pavilion.

Because they had already drawn lots yesterday, there was no need for them to do so today. The competition would directly begin.

Very soon, it was Ling Han’s turn. He directly put on the Battle Armor, and stood in the arena.

His opponent was… Liu Huayun.

This guy was very helpless. Previously, he had not been able to defeat Ling Han, and now the latter was wearing a Battle Armor, which looked to be very powerful. Then, it would be even more impossible for him to defeat Ling Han. However, if he didn’t defeat Ling Han, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the Star Origin Fruit.

He gave it his all, and with a loud roar, black fur quickly grew out all over his body, covering his whole body. In an instant, he had become like a large gorilla. “Yi, I didn’t think that this brat had a sliver of the bloodline of the Vicious Ape.” The Foundation Building elite appeared surprised. The martial arts competition this time not only attracted a great many prodigies, but also some unique geniuses.

Liu Huayun’s hands shook, and the fingernails on his ten fingers popped out. They were as long as a foot, and it was as if ten sharp blades had been placed on them.

He roared loudly, and rushed over, waving his claws continuously at Ling Han. Ling Han did not move, and allowed the other to attack him as he liked. However, a Mystery Realm Tier could not penetrate the defense of the Battle Armor. At least, sharp weapons wouldn’t be able to pierce through this layer of tough armor.

Liu Huayun soon came to his senses. He changed his method of attack, clenched his hands into fists, and delivered a heavy punch at the Battle Armor..
