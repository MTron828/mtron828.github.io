Chapter 2043: Astonishing might

Success!

Ling Han didn’t even get the time to feel pleased when he saw the four seals on the four Godly bones inside his body suddenly resonate with one another, and it was becoming increasingly intense.

‘Sh*t!’

Ling Han only managed to yell internally when he felt a frightening force surge over him.?Pa, pa, pa, pa.?The Godly bones in his body all shattered in an instant, and his mind was also destroyed at the first instant.

Boom, flames burned brightly, and Ling Han walked out from the fiery flames.

“Brat, you almost killed yourself.” Small Tower appeared, and gave him a harsh warning. “If this had been three days ago, there would’ve been no way you could use Rising From The Ashes, and you would’ve died immediately.”

After Rising From The Ashes was used once, a very long amount of time was needed before it could be used a second time. Previously, Ling Han had already “died” once when he had collected the Firm Essence Green Gold, and that hadn’t been too long ago, either.

Ling Han also felt lingering fear, but how could he have foreseen that? When the four Source Powers of heaven and earth resonated and shook together, it could actually cause a burst of such frightening might, so powerful that even his physique could not even withstand it.

“Are you an idiot? Those are Source Powers of heaven and earth, and are of the same level as Celestial Kings. Their might is only limited because they are affected by your cultivation level. But if you are so determined to forcefully unlock this seal, what else could it be but a suicidal move?” Small Tower continued to reprimand him harshly.

Yet Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It was my mistake this time, but even if I was given another chance, I will still choose to do so.

“Because… if I do not do so, there is absolutely no way I can be a match for Ji Wuming!”

And only now did Ling Han see a real hope of defeating Ji Wuming. At least, there was absolutely no possibility that Ji Wuming would be able to shatter Ling Han’s body in a single move, but Ling Han could accomplish that. Thus, if he unleashed this blow, Ji Wuming definitely could not stand against it.

“I really have to study it carefully. This is used to damage my enemy, not to kill myself,” he mumbled to himself, and began to study it again.

“You’re nuts! You’ve gone mad!” Small Tower murmured. It could not understand why Ling Han had to do this, risking his life in an action that seemed so unwise to it.

Yet Ling Han enjoyed it and never tired. He walked on the edge of danger, yet was so excited that every single pore on his body relaxed and expanded.

He guided the four Source Powers of heaven and earth again, but this time, before they completely exploded, he completely poured this power outside.

Boom, a crimson land that was 1,000 miles in diameter immediately appeared ahead of him.

‘So strong!’ Ling Han was slightly dumbfounded. ‘The destructive power of this is stronger than that of any celestial technique that I have grasped, but the disadvantage is that it cannot be changed. It is merely an attack blasted out. If the opponent’s speed is fast enough, he is completely capable of dodging.

‘In that case, I will have to think of a way for this attack to explode even faster, and for the range of blast to become wider so that there would be no way of dodging.

‘Additionally, I feel this attack could explode just the slightest bit later so the four Source Powers of heaven and earth could resonate for a little bit longer.

‘No, no, no. This cannot be considered resonance, but rather making use of the independent nature of the Source Powers of heaven and earth, causing them to collide with each other, which leads to the seals on them unraveling just the slightest bit, bursting out with destructive power that has surpassed my cultivation level.

‘The longer the time of collision is, the more the seal would be unlocked, and the more terrifying the destructive power naturally would be.

‘I just have to control this extent.’

Ling Han tried again. This time, he allowed the four Source Powers of heaven and earth to collide longer.?Boom, the frightening attack was launched, and everything within 10,000 miles of him turned into nothing.

“Wa!” Opening his mouth, he spat out a mouthful of blood. It was golden, looking like liquid gold.

“I almost died!”

He wiped off the cold sweat. This was really wandering on the boundary of life and death. Just now, he had allowed the four Source Powers of heaven and earth to clash just a little longer, and the burst of might soared in power, but at the same time had caused severe injury on him, and all his Godly bones had shattered completely.

If it had been that slight bit longer, he would definitely have died.

“This is really exciting!” He laughed at himself. As he channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, his injuries immediately healed.

These injuries were caused by himself, so the martial intent that was left inside his body naturally could not cause a conflict inside his body. Thus, the moment the Indestructible True Fluid was channeled, his Godly bones recovered instantly.

Small Tower was already so furious that it was giving him the cold shoulder, and did not say a single word.

Ling Han studied his project continuously. He wanted to find a point of balance between power and safety.

Another three days passed in the outside world, and Ling Han finally stopped.

‘Success!’ He broke into a grin. ‘However, using the collision of the four Source Powers of heaven and earth to explode with an attack that can destroy the heaven and earth, can this be considered my own strength?

‘Strictly speaking, this is also depending on external power, but I have just stowed this external power in my own body.

‘My present cultivation level is too low, so I just have to borrow the force of an external power. When I reach the pinnacle, I myself will be the strongest.’

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and asked the women if anything had happened in the last few days.

“Yes. Countless prodigies have gathered, waiting for the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles to start,” Hu Niu said.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. “That’s right. When is this Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles going to begin?”

One could really be quite speechless with him. He had come here to participate, yet didn’t even know what time the tournament would be held.

“Looks like it will still take over a dozen days,” the Empress said.

“Is it going to be tournament stage battles?” Ling Han asked.

“No.” The Empress shook her head. “It is said that everyone will be entering into a natural Mystery Realm, and participate in some kind of contest there. The first one to walk out of it, or ascend to the pinnacle and reach some kind of throne, or obtain some kind of treasure would be first place. They would be instilled with power from the 100 dragons of the Mystery Realm, and have endless benefits.”

Hearing her say such, Ling Han knew that the Empress wasn’t very familiar with the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles, either.

He went to seek out Fu Yue, and get some detailed information.

“In the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm, there are a total of 3,000 great paths—a great path is referring to multiple pathways, and not the Dao of Heaven and Earth[1],” Fu Yue explained.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grit his teeth, and retorted, “I understand this part. There is no need for you to take me for an idiot, and deliberately explain this.”

“Hehe, I was just afraid that you would misunderstand,” Fu Yue said very shamelessly with a smile.

“All right, continue.”

“After we enter into the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm, we have to walk these 3,000 great paths. Only once we will have walked these 3,000 great paths will the real contest truly begin, but I am not too sure of the exact details, either,” Fu Yue said.

‘Interesting.’

“Will the alchemy gathering be held after the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles then?” Ling Han asked.

“En.” Fu Yue nodded. “It’s like that every time. No matter how long the Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles would continue for, ultimately, the alchemy tournament would be after it, so there is no need for you to worry.”

The entry requirement for the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm was being less than 10,000,000 years old, and it would open once every 100,000,000 years, which meant that no one could enter twice. Thus, all information about what was contained within had only been passed on through word of mouth by others.

“Then, we’ll just wait for the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm to open.”

In the next few days, Ling Han was still focused on studying the four Source Powers of heaven and earth. He called this a Clash of Source Powers. At present, it was four Source Powers, but in the future, it could possibly be five, seven, nine!

Meanwhile, Fu Yue hung out with Du Shaojun and his group as if they were joined at the hip. They were all spoiled young masters, and had similar tempers, so they naturally hit it off.

Very quickly, 13 days passed.

Boom, a massive bang echoed throughout the entire city. Whichever corner one was in, they could hear it clearly, and when they all walked out, they only needed to raise their heads, and they would be able to see the images of 100 dragons entwined together in the skies above them.

Finally, these dragon images grouped together to form a doorway.
