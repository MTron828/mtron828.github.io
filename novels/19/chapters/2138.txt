Chapter 2139: Holy Daughter An Ran

This black-robed elder’s face was covered with wrinkles, and he looked to be in his sixties or seventies. His hair was completely white and his body slightly hunched, appearing old and decrepit. However, Ling Han did not dare to underestimate this old geezer in the slightest, because this old geezer’s strength was unfathomable. He had definitely surpassed the Dividing Soul, and might be at the Immortal Palace Tier or Ascending Origin Tier.

It should not be that he was a Celestial King. There was no Celestial King that would lower themselves to this extent. Furthermore, he was not wrapped by any strange lights, either. This was a symbol of Celestial King Tier.

Ling Han smiled. “Old Sir, how do I address you?”

“I would not dare. This old servant’s surname is Chen, and I am a person who takes care of trivial matters in the Palace. Young Master Ling can just address me as Manager Chen,” the black-robed elder said, his attitude appearing incredibly humble.

“Manager Chen.” Ling Han bowed. “I have troubled you.”

“No trouble, no trouble.” Manager Chen chuckled. “Please follow me.”

The old man walked ahead, while Ling Han followed behind him.

As they walked, Manager Chen would give Ling Han a commentary about which place was which lord’s abode. For example, the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King and the others would naturally have a palace of their own, which was like a different world inside, and was incredibly colossal.

“Hmm?”

All of a sudden, Ling Han’s steps paused. He felt a menacing intent enshroud him, as if there was a supreme Divine Sword that was just about to stab a hole through him.

“This old servant pays respects to Holy Daughter An Ran.” Manager Chen bent his waist in respect in a certain direction, while his gaze roamed over Ling Han, showing a hint of surprise, seemingly stunned that Ling Han had actually been able to also discover something was off.

Was it a coincidence?

If it was not a coincidence, then this boy’s awareness was really too sensitive.

A red figure flashed, and a woman leaped out. She wore a bright red body fitting suit, outlining her prideworthy, voluptuous figure on full display. Her beauty was also astonishingly exquisite. Though she was not as beautiful as the Empress and Hu Niu, she was on par with Bewitching Maiden Rou, but her style was strikingly different.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was captivatingly seductive, while this woman was fiery, just like a rose with thorns.

This was Shang Zhiwei’s personal disciple. Her name was An Ran, and she was also known as Holy Daughter An Ran.

An Ran nodded slightly at Manager Chen. Though this person was not a Celestial King, he was an old servant of the Four Seas Palace, and was deeply trusted by Shang Zhiwei. Thus, she also gave him some face. Otherwise, who could garner a second glance from her if they were not a Celestial King?

She glanced at Ling Han again, and calmly stated, “Get out immediately from the Four Seas City, and don’t have any wild delusions.”

She was really overbearing, and did not care what Ling Han’s own thoughts were at all. There was only one word that she wanted to say: scram!

Ling Han chuckled, and replied, “Sure, but I will have to trouble you to send me off.”

He indeed wanted to leave, but without handing Hu Niu over, there was absolutely no way that Shang Zhiwei would deliver him out of here. Thus, if An Ran could send him out of the Four Seas City, Ling Han would naturally leave happily.

An Ran’s eyes became harsh. “Send you off?” What was the meaning of that? Trying to get close to her? She humphed, “I’ll give you one day’s time, and if you are still staying in the city by this time tomorrow, then don’t blame me for having no mercy!”

Having said that, she turned, and left directly.

Ling Han rubbed his nose. This woman was really overbearing.

‘Who cares? Counter soldiers with arms, and water with an earth weir.’

Manager Chen approached, and softly asked, “Young Master Ling, should the Imperial Empress step in?”

This person was definitely one of Shang Zhiwei’s trusted aides. Would any ordinary person be qualified to have a direct audience with Shang Zhiwei? And hearing his tone, it seemed that he could see her whenever he wanted to. This kind of “royal favor” was really strong.

Ling Han shook his head. “It’s fine. Just let her be.”

“Young Master Ling, you must not be careless. Holy Daughter An Ran is a First Secret monarch tier, and though you are also extremely talented, you are only at the Dividing Soul Tier, after all,” Manager Chen continued.

“Wouldn’t I still have the help of Manager Chen in that case?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

He did not know what Manager Chen’s cultivation level was, but he had an instinctive feeling that his strength definitely had to be stronger than An Ran’s, and much stronger at that.

Manager Chen had not thought that Ling Han would reply like this, and involuntarily faltered before breaking into a smile.

This brat was really interesting. He did not have the arrogance that other monarch tiers had at all, not considering every other being beneath himself like them. If it was Lin Xuan, he would definitely talk tough and say that he would resolve the matter himself. However, if he really made that choice, he would only be seeking his own suffering.

Of course, Manager Chen would definitely not just sit by and watch, but he would only interfere when Ling Han was in life-threatening danger. However, with these words from Ling Han, it was definitely impossible that he would delay so long before interfering.

Ling Han was clearly a super monarch tier, but did not have the common ailment of stubborn pride. That was good.

“Since Young Master Ling has already said this, I naturally would not be sitting by and watching,” Manager Chen said with a slight smile. He gestured for them to continue on their way. “Young Master Ling, please.”

“Manager Chen, please.”

Led by Manager Chen, Ling Han toured all over the Four Seas Palace. As for Four Seas City, he could not do the same. That was because it was too large. If he were really to take a tour around there, it could not be done without a few days’ time.

After his tour, Manager Chen arranged accommodations for Ling Han.

“The matters for tomorrow should be left for tomorrow.” Ling Han couldn’t bother himself to think too hard, either. With a flash, his figure had already entered the Black Tower. Even if there was only one day, he had no wish to waste it, either.

At present, he had already opened the upper limits to his cultivation level, and urgently wished to break through to Heaven Soul, and after reaching Heaven Soul, he would not need to go to any Mystery Realm. He would be able to rapidly condense his fifth divided soul, and aim for the true complete pinnacle of the Dividing Soul Tier. Of course, he was presently still short of one Source Power of heaven and earth. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Small Tower, how awesome would it be to condense nine divided souls?” Ling Han asked. He was very curious about this aspect.

Having nine divided souls, just what kind of concept was that?

Fifth severance could match Yang Soul, so wouldn’t Dividing Nine Souls be capable of killing even Fifth Secrets?

“You are overthinking things,” Small Tower scoffed. It had never been one to spare anyone with its words. “The gap between the Dividing Soul Tier and Immortal Palace Tier is too wide. Even if you condensed eight divided souls, you could not possibly match Immortal Palace Tier.”

Ling Han heard the hidden meaning in its words. “Which also means that Dividing Nine Souls would be able to match it?”

“Finally no longer so stupid,” Small Tower said.

Dividing Nine Souls could match Immortal Palace Tier, but that was only limited to the First Secret of the Immortal Palace Tier. Not only was the gap between the Immortal Palace Tier and Dividing Soul Tier extremely wide, the gap was wide as well between every minor level.

“I am only short of one Source Power of heaven and earth,” Ling Han murmured. By now, he was not too far off from Heaven Soul, and his need of nine Source Powers of heaven and earth had also suddenly become urgent.

Small Tower did not say anything further. Ling Han focused hard on cultivation inside the Black Tower, and Hu Niu and the Empress were still attempting to collect the Source Power of heaven and earth. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were rather unoccupied. It was naturally extremely dull to just continue cultivating.

One day in the outside world would be 1,000 days inside the Black Tower. Ling Han exited the Black Tower, feeling a sliver of improvement in his cultivation level.

“Ling Han!” Right at this moment, An Ran’s cold humph was heard from outside.

Here she was.

Ling Han walked out, and saw that An Ran had come in without an invitation. She stood in the middle of the courtyard, and there was actually a young man beside her as well. He bore a modest smile on his face, but every movement was showing his arrogance, showing that his modest display was actually just an act.

“You haven’t scrammed!” An Ran declared coldly, appearing extremely displeased.

“I’m waiting for you to send me off,” Ling Han said smilingly.

“Cheeky mouth!” An Ran’s beautiful eyes narrowed in a glare, and a terrifying pressure spread out like a tsunami.

“An Ran, allow me!” That young man stretched out his arm to hold her back, and his gaze turned on Ling Han, showing a strong contempt and dislike.
