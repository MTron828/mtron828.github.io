Chapter 1957: You are inferior to Shi Xiuwen

Immediately, a great many pairs of eyes looked over, their gaze fixed on Ling Han, looking envious.

This young man was really too lucky.

Hu Niu was so strong that she could defeat even Shi Xiuwen, and she herself was world-shakingly beautiful. With such a beautiful partner, what else could he ask for? Moreover, just look at how ferocious Hu Niu was towards other people, but towards Ling Han, she was as soft and gentle as water. Really... they simply couldn’t say anything else.

Meanwhile, Liu Han’s beautiful eyes were dark, and the gaze she fixed on Ling Han was filled with resentment. If this man did not exist, Hu Niu would be hers. She only had to eat the Heavenly Yang Herb, and then gender would no longer be a problem.

It was this man that had separated her and Hu Niu!

He had to die.

“Ninth Shi is really so weak that he can’t even defeat a piece of trash from the Calm Peace Heaven?” a man who had arrived later scoffed. Seeing all those from Calm Peace Heaven look towards him, he proudly declared, “I, Fei Yun, am ranked sixth among the Severing Mundane Tiers of the Wide Prosperity Heaven.”

Sixth!

Though Hu Niu had won, it had not been an easy win, and Shi Xiuwen was only ranked ninth. Then just how powerful would the sixth be?

Hu Niu bared her teeth, wanting to make a move again.

She had a powerful move she could use, capable of destroying anything, but she could only use it once in many, many days. If there was no other choice, she would definitely not use it. This was a real trump card that could save her life.

Ling Han stretched out a hand and pulled her back, saying, “I’ll go!”

The Empress’s fighting spirit also blazed fiercely, but seeing that Ling Han said that he would fight, she repressed her fighting spirit.

“Trash or otherwise, are you the one to decide?” Ling Han strode out.

“Haha, who from the Calm Peace Heaven is not a piece of trash?” Fei Yun’s expression was filled with contempt. “Why don’t you all just attack together? Just see how I will suppress all of you.”

Arrogant, he was really too arrogant.

Ling Han shook his head. What good was it to bicker with someone arrogant?

Just beat him up!

“Come fight then. Trash or not, we should decide with our fists!”

“Trash, if you want to be beaten up, I will oblige you!” In a flash, Fei Yun had already shot over towards Ling Han. He did not care who else was around them, and simply blasted forwards with a punch. There was a vague seal of great dao on his fist, exuding a brilliance that could shatter everything.

Instantly, all those who were not monarch tiers turned around. Once the force of this punch escaped control, the destructive power would be too terrifying.

Ling Han shook his head, and swiped out a finger. It was a simple action, but seemed capable of suppressing the heaven and earth.

“You dare look down on me!!” Fei Yun roared furiously, and that seal of great dao on his fist also became increasingly distinct. Clearly, the destructive power had increased further.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and greeted the incoming blow with a tap.

Boom! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The first time the two of them clashed, the finger and fist had not actually made direct contact. Instead, there was still a gap of at least nine meters between them. An intense crash had already taken place between the great dao and Origin Power of both sides, and one after another, frightening power and Regulations surged out, radiating in all directions.

The emperor tiers that had just fled were carried away by this power, and they involuntarily swayed as if they were drunk.

They couldn’t help but feel shocked. This was only the difference between an emperor tier and a monarch tier, so how could there be such a wide gap in their strength?

This was natural. Both Ling Han and Fei Yun were in the fifth severance, which was equivalent to a Yang soul elite, and their battle prowess was close to Yin soul. How could Severing Mundane Tier be able to easily sustain the shock waves that resulted from this level of attack?

The fact that they had not been directly killed spoke of how strong these people were. Otherwise, if it had been normal fourth severances, they definitely would have been directly killed off.

Ling Han withdrew his finger, and was extremely calm. “That’s all?”

“Damn, damn, you actually dare look down on me so much!” Fei Yun’s black locks danced, his fury rising to the point of madness.

Ling Han shook his head. “You have an overly high opinion of yourself. Your strength is completely inferior to Shi Xiuwen’s!” The ranking could not truly determine the gap in strength. When he delivered this strike, he had taken his own measures. Fei Yun was inferior to Shi Xiuwen.

...Previously, it was already said that Shi Xiuwen had been ranked ninth because he had encountered that freak who had eventually gotten the first place in his first battle in the ranking battles. As a result, he had suffered a horrible defeat, and was severely injured. In the end, he could only be ranked ninth.

Of course, this did not mean that Fei Yun was not strong.

As a monarch tier, Fei Yun was naturally strong. Furthermore, he indeed could be ranked among the top 10 of the Wide Prosperity Heaven. Compared to Shi Xiuwen, there should not be too much of a gap, but how could top-tier prodigies afford that slight bit of a gap?

“After I beat you into dust, you will understand just how far the gap is between you and me!” A black aura flowed out of Fei Yun’s eyes, endlessly rising, and turning into a black scythe.

“Death Scythe!” Someone gasped in shock, and even his expression had taken a drastic change. It should be known that the speaker was an emperor tier himself.

“I really had not thought that Fei Yun would use the Death Scythe so quickly.” A monarch tier sighed ruefully.

“Who asked that brat to have angered Fei Yun?” Another monarch tier, meanwhile, delighted in the misery of others.

In the first place, there was a direct competitive relationship among monarch tiers, and now it was an exchange between two great Heavens, so naturally they hoped that Fei Yun could kill Ling Han.

Fei Yun once again charged out. He had not yet arrived when the massive scythe behind him was already slashing over. It was clearly only an image, yet was exuding the cold light of metal, as if it was solid.

Ling Han’s right hand curled into a fist, and shot a punch at the air.

Crack!

As if a sudden bolt of lightning had struck out of the blow, creases then appeared in the space, wave after wave spreading out in all directions.

The Death Scythe was immediately affected. Its course had been blocked, and then damage appeared. Flakes of rust emerged before they floated down. Finally, it turned into countless pieces, which were taken away by the winds.

Hiss, seeing the force of this punch, everyone inhaled sharply. Even the monarch tiers showed expressions of shock.

It had been such a frightening blow from Fei Yun, and yet had been destroyed by a casual punch. Ling Han’s strength was practically unfathomable.

“Good! Good!” Hu Niu immediately began to cheer. The Empress, meanwhile, clapped her hands. The two women would disregard everyone else, and do whatever they liked. For example, other women would probably now be embarrassed to cheer for their husband, right?

But not them.

“As expected, you are inferior to Shi Xiuwen,” Ling Han said with certainty.

Fei Yun’s hands balled into fists. He was so furious that a vein popped out on his forehead.

It was very rare for a prodigy like him to be angered by anything, but he very much valued his ranking—it was one of the reasons to motivate him to tirelessly work on his cultivation.

Determination to become the strongest!

But now? Ling Han had actually overlooked all his effort, actually thinking that he was inferior to even Shi Xiuwen, who was ranked ninth. Then didn’t that mean that he could only be ranked 10th?

How could he tolerate that?

“You are courting your death!” he said menacingly. His right hand shook, and a black scythe appeared, bearing a strong resemblance to the Death Scythe above his head.

He used some kind of secret technique, and another image appeared, turning into a gigantic human figure that gripped that Death Scythe.

“Soul Slash!” he roared, waving the scythe in his hand, and above his head, that human figure also waved the Death Scythe.

Weng, an indescribable bizzare shock wave swept towards Ling Han.

“En?” Ling Han was slightly surprised. “It is indeed a slash on the soul. This blow is purely Regulations taking form in an attack, and can also completely ignore physical defense, reaching straight to the mind, striking the soul and eliminating it.

“Unfortunately, this force is too weak.”

Ling Han showed an expression of disappointment. Though Fei Yun was only slightly weaker than Shi Xiuwen, this little bit of gap between them made him lose all his fighting spirit.

He was just a piece of trash.
