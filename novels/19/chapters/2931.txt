2932 I am an ultimate Grandmaster

Ling Han brought Bai Mifan and traversed through the Void. He was constantly vigilant. The moment he discovered any trace of Hysteria, he would immediately return to the Genesis World. He definitely wouldn’t have any thoughts of getting lucky.

This time, it was only Ling Han and Bai Mifan. Because there was a strict limit on the number of people, the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others had all stayed behind in the Realm Battlefield. They could not possibly follow him here willfully.

Fortunately, Hysteria didn’t appear. Although Ling Han was cautious, the two safely and smoothly arrived at the Genesis World of the last era.

After learning the truth, Ling Han and Bai Mifan had different feelings when they set foot on this piece of land again.

This place had once been glorious, and had once represented everything. However, because of Hysteria, it had now become ruins, and could only float in the Void forever.

“Say, do you think there’s another Genesis World of the era before last?” Bai Mifan suddenly asked.

Ling Han was surprised. “Your imagination is too active, isn’t it?”

“That may not be the case. Perhaps Hysteria has originated from an even more ancient era, and even the Genesis World of the last era was just like us.” Bai Mifan insisted on this point of view.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself. “That’s true. With how big the Void is, there may be the ruins of another Genesis World.”

“If we can find it, then wouldn’t we make a fortune?” Bai Mifan’s eyes lit up.

He was a very calm young man, but as he was talking about a Genesis World now, he was naturally excited.

Yet Ling Han thought that if his body could also evolve into a Genesis World, then wouldn’t he be able to have whatever he wanted?

“Let’s go.” He patted Bai Mifan’s shoulder.

They had to hurry up. They only had 100,000 years.

100,000 years might seem very long, but for Heavenly Venerates, this was a pitifully short amount of time.

They arrived at the fifth dimension, and searched for that passageway.

This did not take too much time. The two of them were very careful because Xin Qihu had also come here. He would definitely not let go of Ling Han, and if he had the chance, he would definitely kill him.

Ling Han had confiscated a great many Great Herbs from the World Alliance, but left them for the Empress and the others. This was mostly because he needed too many resources to advance another step further, and this small amount of Great Herbs was actually not of much use to him.

Thus, it would be better to let the Empress and the others have them. Their improvement would be obvious, and they would be able to significantly increase their strength.

“I’ll go check things out, and see if there is any ambush,” Bai Mifan said.

Ling Han was more inclined to believe that if Xin Qihu had arrived here long ago, he would definitely be clinging to the treasures of the 10th dimension. He should not have wasted time waiting for him here, but it was better to be safe than sorry, so he nodded.

Bai Mifan walked over, and he came back after a while and gave Ling Han a gesture, indicating that it was safe.

Ling Han and Bai Mifan passed through this passageway. They obviously didn’t feel any change in space, but as they walked, the path ahead suddenly became clearthey had already appeared in another place.

“Follow me,” Ling Han said.

He was a grandmaster of raw stone, and who could compare to him in the exploration for veins of raw stone?

Bai Mifan hurriedly followed. “I say, are you also skilled in searching for veins of raw stone?”

“Ha, don’t you know that I’m known as the mine exploration expert?” Ling Han joked.

“I really couldn’t tell,” Bai Mifan said without fear; this was practically challenging his authority.

“Then just wait and see.”

Not only was Ling Han exploring for veins, but he was also looking for a new spatial passageway that could lead to a higher-level dimension. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Since a passage had appeared here, perhaps there would be a second, a third several hundred or a few thousand.

However, their luck was not that good. For the moment, they had not discovered a spatial passageway, though they had discovered a considerable number of veins of ore. With Ling Han mining them precisely, they obtained Great Herbs every time, which made Bai Mifan exclaim in disbelief.

“You really are a grandmaster of raw stone?” he asked in surprise. It should be known that the Heavenly Venerable Stone could cut off divine sense, and even Heavenly Venerates could not use their divine sense to penetrate them.

“No, I am an ultimate grandmaster,” Ling Han said jokingly.

Bai Mifan couldn’t help much in mine exploration, so he took the initiative to search for the spatial passageway. Even Ling Han did not have the ability to cheat for that, so he could only work hard and search bit by bit.

Furthermore, this was the 10th dimension, which was incredibly dangerous. Occasionally, there would be energy storms that reached the Sixth Tier surging out of the ground. Thus, whether it was exploring for veins of ore or searching for spatial passageways, one had to be extremely careful, as well as possess mighty strength.

Otherwise, if one was not able to react in time, Heavenly Venerates with battle prowess below the Sixth Tier would only die.

In truth, even elites with battle prowess of the Sixth Tier would have to be extremely careful. If they were hit by the energy storm, they might not die, but they would definitely be severely injured. If they were trapped by the energy storm, they would also die.

Ling Han and Bai Mifan divided the work among themselves.

There were even fewer people here, so the competition was naturally even smaller. Ling Han was also a cheat-level grandmaster of raw stone. It could be imagined just how astonishing his gains were.

After a few thousand years, he had gathered over 200 Great Herbs, and one of them was an orange-colored Great Herb, which could be helpful in advancing one’s cultivation level. Additionally, there were also a dozen Heavenly Venerable Seals, but only one was a seventh-grade seal. The others were all ninth- or eighth-grade, which he had long since obtained.

‘Great Herbs aren’t bad, either. It can increase my cultivation level, and at this stage, this should be what I need the most. Heavenly Venerable Seals are only icing on the cake.’

Ling Han felt that he had already found enough here. It would be best if Bai Mifan returned immediately, and told him that he had found the passage to the dimensions even further undergroundthis had once been a Genesis World, so even if there were countless low-level dimensions that had been completely destroyed in the great explosion, there should still at least be around 1,000 dimensions remaining.

Right now, they had only explored 10 dimensions. As for the remaining dimensions there was an astonishingly large number of them.

Ling Han left marks as he explored mines, anticipating his meet-up with Bai Mifan again.

However, it was destined that enemies would meet.

On this day, after Ling Han had just found a large vein of ore and unearthed a few Great Herbs, he suddenly sensed an aura of life approaching him.

Had Bai Mifan returned?

Ling Han stopped what he was doing, and turned around to look.

A person appeared, bearing supreme dominance like an emperor, as if the whole world should obey him.

Xin Qihu!

Ling Han sighed upon seeing this. Why was it that whoever he didn’t want to see would appear?

“Haha, Ling Han, you have delivered yourself to my doorstep!” Xin Qihu was also startled. That was because he had not deliberately been tracking Ling Han, and had completely come here by coincidence. However, he did not hesitate in the slightest, and immediately charged over.

Thoughts sped quickly through Ling Han’s mind. Of course, he could tear a rip into the Void and return, but if he wanted to come back here again, it would take him a lot of time.

...

He only had a total of 100,000 years, and definitely could not waste it on making his way back here.

Thus, he turned around and fled.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Xin Qihu pursued rapidly, attacking madly as he did so, wanting to kill Ling Han.
