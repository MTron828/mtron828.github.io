Chapter 1461 Twofold Heavenly Tribulation

10 years slowly crept by.

Humans were forgetful beings, and thus there was already very little attention on what was going on in the Sunken Abyss Valley. Even though such astounding events had occurred there 10 years ago, even astonishing a Saint, many people had already become accustomed to its current state.

The cultivators who had successfully reached the second stage were still bathing in the blessing of heaven and earth that was exuded by the Sun Stone, tempering their bodies. The most evident sign of this was their physique, where a sheen of light was continuously pulsating.

It was possible that they could master the legendary Sun Physique, a physique that could unleash a dazzling glow when they were battling against their opponents. Not only could this glow affect their opponent’s vision, but it could even trick their divine sense. This was an incredibly powerful physique.

Moreover, physiques that were mastered later in life and not naturally possessed wouldn’t affect one’s original bloodline or physique. In other words, they could be viewed as a Mystical Power. Thus, this would bring huge benefits to all of the cultivators in the second stage. However, one person was different.

Gu Daoyi.

This was because he had already mastered a Mystical Power, Dazzle the Heavens, in his first life. This Mystical Power had similar effects to the Sun Physique. Thus, even though he had now combined the two Mystical Powers, elevating the might of the former, the benefit that he had received from this was far inferior to that of the other cultivators. After all, they had learned a new Mystical Power, whereas he had simply seen some slight improvement in his own Mystical Power.

This was still better than nothing though, just that his improvement was far too minute.

Weng!

At this moment, the light that was enveloping the valley suddenly vanished. Everyone opened their eyes at the same time.

The blessings of heaven and earth had finally come to an end.

“I think I’ve mastered an incredible Mystical Power!”

“Gasp! I actually advanced from the early stage of the medium extreme to the middle stage of the medium extreme!”

“Me too! I advanced from the middle stage of the high extreme to the late stage of the high extreme!”

“My physique has grown stronger, and it seems like I can absorb Spiritual Qi and sense the existence of heaven and earth with far more ease.”

The cultivators all shouted in delight and astonishment. After absorbing the blessings of heaven and earth for 10 years, all of them had experienced tremendous improvements.

Gu Daoyi was slightly baffled at first. However, killing intent quickly spread across his face as he looked at the gigantic golden boulder in the sky.

He felt like his great opportunity had been stolen from him.

His Divine Fetus had indeed advanced slightly, yet this improvement wasn’t especially great. Moreover, receiving the Sun Physique was completely negligible for him. In addition, he had already reached the barrier of the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier, so unless he advanced to the Eternal River Tier, he would barely see any improvements in his cultivation.

If the benefits received by the others were given a score of 10 out of 10, then the benefits that he had received would only score a maximum of one out of 10!

More detestable was the fact that Ling Han might have received benefits that scored 100 out of 10!

He was seething with killing intent. Regardless of what benefits Ling Han had received, he would definitely steal them away from him! This great fortune could only belong to him!

Boom!

He soared into the sky. The Sunken Abyss Valley had already returned to normal at this moment, so he could naturally use the ability of flight. In his eyes, a distance of 3000 meters was nothing, and he covered this distance in the blink of an eye. He then ruthlessly lashed out, swiping his palm at the gigantic golden boulder.

At that time, he had clearly seen Ling Han being absorbed into the gigantic golden boulder. Moreover, he believed that Ling Han was still inside. Now that he was attacking an unprepared Ling Han, he was convinced that he could severely injure or even kill him.

After all, he wasn’t at the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier anymore. Rather, he had already regained his normal cultivation!

He was at the peak stage of the pinnacle level, and he possessed the ability to kill even elites at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier!

“You dare?!” Empress Luan Xing dashed over to block him.

“Stop!” The Rain Emperor also lashed out.

“You dare to disrespect my master?!” Ding Ping and Jiuyao also charged over.

Although Xu Ran, the Notionless Saint, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden didn’t speak, they also launched attacks toward Gu Daoyi.

“Do you think ants like you can stop me?” Gu Daoyi said with a sneer. He had already regained his power now, and he more so possessed a Divine Fetus and 10 lifetimes of Mystical Power. Who in the Heavenly Body Tier could stop him?

He simply made a pressing motion with his left hand to defend against their attacks. Meanwhile, his right hand continued to slap toward the gigantic golden boulder.

He was exuding a mighty aura as he battled against seven king tiers alone.

Peng!

There was a deafening rumble as Gu Daoyi’s palm struck the gigantic golden boulder. At the same time, the gigantic golden boulder also started to crumble, disintegrating into millions upon billions of broken pieces. In fact, these disintegrating shards of rock were so small that they were invisible to the naked eye.

The attacks of Empress Luan Xing and the others arrived immediately afterward. However, Gu Daoyi’s left hand transformed into a gigantic black demonic palm that blocked all of their ferocious attacks.

However, Gu Daoyi frowned slightly as he raised his left hand. To his surprise, there were three fractures on his palm.

One was caused by Empress Luan Xing, one by the Rain Emperor, and one by the Notionless Saint.

He couldn’t help but feel astonished. There were actually three people who could wound him?

He had underestimated them!

However, the other cultivators in the abyss were even more stunned. Seven king tiers had attacked in unison, and among them, there were even the supreme king tiers, “King Tier Assassin” and “Fists Demon”, yet they had only managed to draw a few streaks of blood from Gu Daoyi’s palm?

Gu Daoyi was truly a powerful being! He truly lived up to his name as the greatest prodigy of all eternity!

However, many people also turned their gaze toward where the gigantic golden boulder had once been. In that spot, there was a person standing tall and proud.

It was Ling Han!

Had Gu Daoyi shattered the Sun Stone?

The answer was evidently negative. Not to mention that he was only at the Heavenly Body Tier, he wouldn’t have been able to shatter it even if he had regained the peak power of his past lives. Otherwise, wouldn’t the Hu Clan have obtained the Nine Heavens Flame tens of billions of years ago?

In fact, it was because its essence had already been completely absorbed that the Sun Stone had become so weak and brittle. Since it had lost its essence and become an ordinary stone, it was naturally extremely weak, and would shatter under a single strike.

Ling Han’s eyes were shut, and there was still a wealth of information whirling about in his mind. He still had yet to come to his senses.

The Nine Heavens Flame had already taken root and become a part of his life force. Although it was still a young flame, it would grow along with his cultivation. In the future... its power would astound even Celestial Kings[1]!

Kuang!

There was the rumble of thunder as dark clouds rolled over and arcs of brilliant white lightning intertwined across the sky. That layer of dark clouds, those thousand-meter-long arcs of lightning... All of these caused a feeling apprehension to rise in the cultivators’ hearts.

‘Is this an apocalypse? Why is it so terrifying?!’

The cultivators all shook their heads. Although many of them had advanced in cultivation, none of them had managed to advance to the next minor level. This was a barrier that they had to comprehend and overcome by themselves. Thus, this wasn’t heavenly tribulation for them.

They were all extremely curious. Whose tribulation was this? It was far too devastating...

Gu Daoyi still wanted to attack, yet he had no option but to forcefully suppress his urge.

He discovered that this was Ling Han’s heavenly tribulation.

However, this tribulation was far too terrifying—so much so that even he felt apprehensive about it. If he interfered... it was very likely that he would die!

He was beside himself with shock. How could there exist such a formidable heavenly tribulation?

However, Ling Han wasn’t surprised in the least. This was because he had already advanced to the peak stage of the pinnacle level. As such, this was a twofold heavenly tribulation that he was facing. That being the case, its might was naturally far greater than normal.

Why didn’t his heavenly tribulations arrive one after the other?

This was because the Sun Stone had severed the senses of heaven and earth! Ordinary stones naturally couldn’t achieve this. However, this was a celestial stone, meaning that the level of its existence was far transcendent above that of the Immortal Realm. Thus, it was naturally possible for it to sever the senses of heaven.

Kuang!

Heavenly tribulation rapidly gathered above Ling Han. Before long, a bolt of lightning that measured 300 meters in width violently struck down, directly striking at Ling Han’s head.

This was twofold heavenly tribulation, and the might of its whole was far greater than the sum of its parts. In fact, it was 10 times more powerful!

Pa!

The cultivators witnessed everything clearly. After a single strike, Ling Han’s body had already become a broken mess of ripped flesh and shattered bones.

‘He’s died just like that?’

‘Although this heavenly tribulation is indeed powerful, isn’t it far too pathetic to die after just a single strike? He didn’t even put up a struggle!’

However, Gu Daoyi’s expression became even more solemn. He possessed a Divine Fetus, and thus he could sense Ling Han’s condition even through the powerful tribulation. Ling Han hadn’t died. His aura still remained. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In fact, Ling Han had actively shattered his own body in order to be tempered by the heavenly tribulation.

He was an absolute freak!
