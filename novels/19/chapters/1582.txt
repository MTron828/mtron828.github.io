Chapter 1583: The Tan Clan makes trouble

The Tan Clan actually joined the Heaven Crushing Alliance?

Wasn’t it said that the grand elder of the Tan Clan was afraid of getting into trouble, and worried that forcibly interfering in the evolution of heaven and earth would result in divine punishment, and a heavenly tribulation would descend and erase them directly? Why did they suddenly now want to join the Heaven Crushing Alliance?

When Ling Han found out, he couldn’t help but smirk coldly.

The Tan Clan had come for him.

They knew that he had a “Celestial King” technique, so how could they be willing to give it up? But he had already gone to Green River Valley. There was no way that the Tan Clan would dare to attack the Green River Valley by force, right? Thus, they chose to join the Heaven Crushing Alliance, and then they naturally would be able to send their own people in.

As long as their people could enter, they would have a chance to move—it was impossible that Ling Han would continue to close himself up in the Green River Valley, right? Then, once he left, they would be able to target him and find a chance to make a move on him.

“They really are troublesome pests. I haven’t gone to seek you all out; instead, you have come on your own!” Ling Han smirked coldly. He had one to three times of power boosts from the Black Tower, so he did not mind using these chances on the Tan Clan.

The Tan Clan joining the Heaven Crushing Alliance did not cause much commotion. They arranged for a Black Demon to come here as a teacher. Additionally, they also sent in three clansmen, but none of them were as outstanding as Tan Mo. In fact, they were inferior to even Mo Li and Zhu Ba.

In the Green River Valley, all the young king tiers were discussing spiritedly regarding the reason for drawing in a new Forbidden Land.

“This is for the sake of competing with the Forbidden Lands from the Immortal Realm,” someone explained, seeming to know the truth. “At first, with eight Forbidden Lands of the Immortal Realm and eight Forbidden Lands of the Netherworld, we just reached a balance, and neither side has an absolute say, but our grand elders here clearly want to emerge superior over them, and have thus decided to draw in a new Forbidden Land.”

“Furthermore, our Netherworld has eight Forbidden Lands in the first place, so a major decision would not be easily settled on. What if it was four against four, so who should decide in that case?”

“Now that there would be five against four, there would definitely be one side that would be dominant.”

“Even if it is just one additional Forbidden Land, the game of power that is involved here is extremely deep!”

“In the first place, there were already two voices in the alliance. One wishes to draw in excellent saplings from the outside world, while the other objects and thinks that benefits should be kept among our own people. Furthermore, even if outsiders are married into the clan, it would also affect the purity of our bloodline.”

“Now, there may be conflict between these two voices.”

“Those that can decide are all the grand elders; we will just quietly watch on.”

After this happened, Ouyang Taishan had purposely come and sought out Ling Han. He told him to maintain as much of a low profile as possible and focus on cultivation. It was best that he did not leave the Green River Valley, thus avoiding any trouble from rising.

Clearly, he, too, could tell the purpose of the Tan Clan, but he was not the only person in the Heaven Crushing Alliance, so he could not expel the Tan Clan.

Ling Han sank into deep thought.

For the sake of Ouyang Taishan who had helped him before, he did not mind helping the former achieve his lifelong dream, and become a core himself to speed up the merging of the two Realms. This was a great merit, and would also be greatly beneficial to him.

But if there was someone in the Heaven Crushing Alliance targeting him, he would not be happy to do that. You guys were already planning to harm me, and I would be still dumbly working for you?

“I have to quickly advance into the Genesis Tier. At that time, even if I cannot match a Heaven Demon or Saint Tier, the rest of the world would be enough for me to move unhindered, and I wouldn’t have to depend on the Black Tower every single time.” Ling Han affirmed his resolve, and did not bother with the disturbances going on outside, concentrating on his cultivation.

Yet, the tree longed for peace, but the wind would never cease[1].

He sat in his stone chamber. Today, the cultivation resources for the next year would be distributed. Though he had absolutely no use for them, they were precious treasures for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She already had one foot in the Eternal River Tier.

But no matter how long he waited, no one came. A day passed, and still no one came to deliver anything.

Ling Han did not take it to heart. In any case, one day of being late was not too serious. However, he still did not see anyone deliver anything to him on the second and third day. Naturally, he felt that there was something off, and when he went out and made some queries, he was instantly fuming mad. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

HIs cultivation resources had been docked by that Black Demon from the Tan Clan.

Such a brazen move, and the other powerful figures actually did not do anything?

Ling Han couldn’t help but think of the rumors that he had heard—there were two voices in the Heaven Crushing Alliance. One was open-minded, while the other was conservative. At present, being open-minded was mainstream to draw in young talents. But the Tan Clan had publicly docked his cultivation resources, and by now, not a single mighty figure had stepped out to voice objection. The significance of this action was something worth thinking about.

The conservative party was about to gain the upper hand?

Or rather, both parties were arguing about this matter at present. Once everything was settled, there could possibly be a drastic change in the Heaven Crushing Alliance!

Ling Han was slightly confused. It was clear that he was the “only” candidate that had merged the Regulations of the two Realms, and even if it was the conservative party, they would take him into consideration first. After all, entering into the Celestial Realm was the major prerequisite that would surpass everything else in importance.

“That’s right, some people want to get a cultivation technique from me, and think that the fact that I can merge the Regulations of the two Realms is not due to my own natural talent, but rather because I have cultivated a powerful celestial technique.

‘Then, as long as they can snatch my technique, they naturally would be able to merge the Regulations of the two Realms.

‘Hoho, at present, they still do not have a united voice among themselves, so I can still sit peacefully here. It is only the vile characters from the Tan Clan making trouble, but if there is only one voice left, it is possible that I will be in dire straits!

‘A man does not keep himself in danger. I cannot base my own safety on the decisions of others.

‘This place... is not suitable to stay in any longer!’

Ling Han did not seek out that Black Demon of the Tan Clan. Since he had docked his cultivation resources, seeking him out to argue with him would only be seeking his own humiliation. In any case, he had no need of them at all, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden would not need them for the moment, either, so there was no rush.

However, the Tan Clan made a further provoking move. They actually splashed dog’s blood on the doors to Ling Han’s cave dwelling, and even wrote a great many insulting words, despising him to the utmost.

“Thankfully Little Black is not here, or your behinds would be bitten into three parts,” Ling Han mumbled to himself. He still made no response, because he wanted to know what kind of attitude the Heaven Crushing Alliance was going to take.

If someone stepped out and stood up for him, then he would still be willing to stay in this place. In the future, when the two Realms were merged, this would also be a great merit.

He was waiting for the Heaven Crushing Alliance to make their stand clear. This would decide what his next move would be.

What disappointed Ling Han was that when a few juniors from the Tan Clan provoked him in public, still no powerful figure stepped out to stop them.

“Ling Han, do you dare battle?!”

“I will only use one finger.”

“A mere lowly commoner, an ant, and he actually dares to enter into the Heaven Crushing Alliance so shamelessly, ptui!”

Three clansmen of the Tan Clan threw out insults at Ling Han’s cave dwelling practically every day. This naturally was witnessed by the other young king tiers, yet they all chose to sit by and watch. None of them were idiots. Till the end, none of the powerful figures had appeared, and this showed their attitude in this matter.

Today, the three people of the Tan Clan were still hurling insults outside, their words extremely rude and unpleasant. Who knew where such king tiers like them had learnt such crude curse words.

Shua, a figure flashed past, and a few pa sounds rang out. The three members of the Tan Clan were all sent flying with slaps, one side of their faces extremely swollen.

Ling Han stood there, his hands crossed behind his back. He was about to commit bloodshed.
