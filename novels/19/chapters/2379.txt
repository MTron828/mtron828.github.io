When the young man jumped out, it was equivalent to having thrown a large rock into a peaceful pool of water, instantly causing a great commotion.

“Who is this brat? I can tell that he is only a Severing Mundane Tier, so how can he act so arrogant?”

“That’s right. He actually dares to call himself a young master in front of the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe. He really is secure, knowing that he has backing.”

“Where has he popped out from?”

“Hush, could it be that you guys do not know of the Kong Clan?”

“Hiss, the Kong Clan of Three Cloud City?”

“Che, aside from the Kong Clan of the Three Cloud City, what other clan with the surname of Kong would dare call themselves the Kong Clan?”

“Kong Clan is one of the well-known clans of a four-star force. It is rumored that their Ascending Origin Tier elites number in the hundreds. They have all emerged in the last few billion years, and are all waiting for the Celestial Path to open. And once they walked the Celestial Path, the Kong Clan would have five Celestial Kings at least!”

“Even a considerable number of great sects cannot compare to this, right? To have five Celestial Kings emerge at the same time, this is practically the stuff of fantasies.”

“Could it be that this brat is a descendant of the Kong Clan?”

“His name is Kong Shuang, and he is also part of the main line of the Kong Clan. It is said that for the sake of obtaining this betrothal, the Nine Snake Tribe not only approached them of their own volition, but also paid a great price for it.”

“If it was me, and I could become in-laws with the Kong Clan, I would spare no expense, either.”

“No wonder this brat dares to be so arrogant!”

“Still, to flip out in public like this, he is absolutely spoiled rotten!”

“It can’t be helped. Who asked him to be a son of the Kong Clan?”

Everyone chattered back and forth. It was like they were telling a story as they gave a clear explanation of the origins of this young man.

Ling Han gave an “oh.” As it turned out, this Kong Shuang had a betrothal contact with the Nine Snake Tribe, but when he saw how the Empress was more beautiful, he was immediately dissatisfied with his betrothed.

“Kong Shuang, where do you think this is? Do not spout nonsense!” the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe exclaimed in displeasure. No matter how much he wanted to become in-laws with the Kong Clan, there was no way he would allow a junior to point a finger at his nose and shout at him.

Yet Kong Shuang was used to being spoiled, and did not have any fear at all. Raising his head high, he demanded, “I want this woman to be my wife!”

He looked at the Empress, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets.

The Empress flew into a thunderous rage, but had not flipped out yet when Ling Han held her back, leaning close to her ear, and said, “Let’s just see how your family will deal with this matter.”

If the Nine Snake Tribe could fully defend the Empress, he would also consider the Nine Snake Tribe his own family as well. With the ability of someone who was about to step into the level of a Five-Star Alchemist, it was really a small matter for him to help a clan prosper again.

But if the Nine Snake Tribe would only push the Empress out to resolve the matter, the Nine Snake Tribe would only be strangers to him. In fact, it was possible that he would erase them on a whim.

The Empress nodded, and because Ling Han was too close to her, his warm breath was felt on her neck, causing a faint flush to rise up on her jade-like complexion, and increasing her exquisiteness even more.

Kong Shuang was naturally drooling even more, wanting nothing more than to immediately snatch the Empress over.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe released his aura, which suppressed Kong Shuang, and did not allow him to continue shouting so that the ceremony could be completed successfully.

Kong Shuang left on the day itself.

“Ancestor, I will go and snipe him!” In the great hall, someone asked for instructions from the ancestor.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe thought for a short while, and then nodded. “Make it clean. Don’t leave behind any clues.”

When this boy returned, he would definitely tell tales, and rather than allowing things to progress to the extent when the matter could not be easily resolved, it would be better to kill him directly.

None of these people were the type to be generous and kind.

“Understood.” This man left quietly, but not long after, he returned and reported, “Ancestor, I did not manage to catch up with Kong Shuang. He used a precious tool, which was astonishingly fast.”

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe frowned. “Has he discovered you?”

“No,” the person hurriedly replied.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe nodded, his frown relaxing. It was fine as long as he was not discovered, or the matter would really become a huge mess.

Counter soldiers with arms, and water with an earth weir then.

Now that the Empress had returned to the Nine Snake Tribe, she had naturally gained approval to enter into the underground palace hall. The ultimate inheritance of the Nine Snake Tribe lay there, and after maturity, every clan member had to stay there for a period of time so that they could advance their physique.

Merely a day later, the Empress had come out, causing everyone in the Nine Snake Tribe to feel very disappointed.

Because normally the stronger the bloodline, the longer she could stay in the underground palace, and only then would the physique she cultivated be stronger.

But the Empress only stayed there for a single day, which was less than even the weakest person of their clan.

Could it be that her nine doppelgangers and the cultivation level of Immortal Palace Tier were all lies?

These rumors immediately arose within the clan. It was truly hard to believe that she had actually come out after only a single day with the bloodline that could form nine doppelgangers. It should be known that one of the two other clan members that had the bloodline of nine doppelgangers stayed for 49 days, while the other stayed for 47 days.

In comparison, the Empress was practically trash.

The resolve of the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe wavered at this. Should they give up this member of their clan?

If the Empress had incomparable aptitude, then for the sake of the future of the Nine Snake Tribe, he would definitely protect the Empress to his full efforts. But if the Empress was just an idiot, then the only use for her was as a bargaining chip to be offered in an alliance through marriage.

And under such circumstances, someone came from the Kong Clan.

They put on great airs. Three Ascending Origin Tier elites led the group, and this was enough to raze the Nine Snake Tribe to the ground.

The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe did not dare to be careless, and entertained the three of them in the great hall. Furthermore, the Empress had also been summoned. After all, she was an involved party.

Ling Han accompanied her, while the other women stayed behind in their quarters.

Only four people had come from the Kong Clan, and the last member of the group was Kong Clan, but the arrangement of having three great Ascending Origin Tier elites in the group was very, very shocking.

“Brothers Kong, please!” The ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe raised his wine cup, offering a toast to the three Ascending Origin Tier elites of the Kong Clan.

These three Ascending Origin Tiers from the Kong Clan were Kong An, Kong Le, and Kong Ye. They were all at the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, so they were putting on a lot of airs. They were sure that once the Celestial Path was open, they would be able to become Celestial Kings.

The trio raised their cups reservedly, but they only touched the rim of the cup at their lips slightly and that was it.

“Brother Luan Gui, I have to say that you have not been very conscientious in this matter!” Kong An was the first to raise difficult questions.

“Why do you say this?” the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe asked smilingly.

“When you formed an alliance of marriage with our Kong Clan, you said you would offer the most beautiful pearl of your clan, but according to Shuang’er, that is not the case at all,” Kong An stated evenly, and then his eyes turned harsh as he glared at the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe. “Are you playing around with our Kong Clan?”

Immediately, a sense of displeasure rose up in the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe. For better or worse, he was also an Ascending Origin Tier, and was at the consummate level as well. He was just short of the Celestial Path to becoming a Celestial King himself—of course, the majority of Ascending Origin Tiers would ultimately die of old age at this level, and would never be able to cross this threshold.

However, the Kong Clan had sent three consummate-level Ascending Origin Tiers, clearly meaning to intimidate him.

A little impatience would spoil great plans!

He thought, and then spoke, “Luan Xing has only returned to our clan not too long ago, so it was not a deliberate deception on my part!”

Kong Shuang leaped out, pointed at the Empress, and called out, “That’s all right, then; you can just marry her to me!”

Kong An and the others were all rubbing their beards and smiling, with absolutely no intentions of reprimanding him. Initially, this was absolutely not a situation in which a mere Severing Mundane Tier would be allowed to interrupt, yet they did not reprimand him. This was spoiling him too much.

Ling Han stood up first, and did not allow the Empress to flip out first. It was naturally the man that had to step out in this kind of situation.

He strode over to Kong Shuang, a faint smile on his face. “You are quite brave that you dare to even think of my wife.”

“Very soon, she will no longer be your wife!” Kong Shuang declared disdainfully. “You will only be a dead man!”

Ling Han reached him, and sent out a palm strike.?Pa, and Kong Shuang was immediately turned into a mess of blood and flesh.
