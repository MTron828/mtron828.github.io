Chapter 2124: Untitled

Ling Han pulled Seventh Brother forwards, and replied, “Oh, I am here to seek justice.”

Seek justice?

“Milord, dare I ask what offense our clan has committed against you?” Liu Huashan asked cautiously.

Ling Han kicked Seventh Brother, and replied, “Not me, but two kids.” He related how Seventh Brother and his party had almost run over the children.

Hearing Ling Han finish his tale, every member of the Liu Clan bore strange expressions.

F***, just because of such a minor matter, you actually charged personally to the Liu Clan?

Wasn’t it just two mere mortals? Who would care about their life or death?

Ling Han swept a glance over the masses, and stated calmly, “I care!”

Though the members of the Liu Clan still thought nothing of it, they did not dare reveal their thoughts in their expressions.

“Then dare I ask, milord, what kind of compensation you wish to seek from us?” Liu Huashan asked.

Whatever the case, Ling Han had still resolved the threat of the Kong Clan for them — at least for now, that was the case, and Ling Han also had the ability to destroy the Liu Clan single-handedly. Thus, the members of the Liu Clan naturally dared not show any disrespect towards him at all.

This was a demon king. Who knew what kind of terrifying damage would be caused by his thunderous rage?

“Since you cannot control your own subordinates, then does the Liu Clan still have the need to exist?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“You, you want to destroy our Liu Clan?” Liu Huashan inhaled sharply.

Ling Han shook his head, “I will give you a month’s time to disband the Liu Clan. Otherwise, I will disband it on your behalf.”

“Milord, those were just two little brats, and our Liu Clan would hav eto pay such an exorbitant price for it. This is unjust!” Liu Huashan called out loudly, filled with defiance.

“One month!” Ling Han did not waste any more words, and merely found a house in the town to stay in.

He had deliberately given a time limit of a month. HIs purpose was not to destroy the Liu Clan, but rather to force the Liu Clan to continue seeking out the members of the Imperial Void Sect.

This was an opportunity. He wanted to find his way into the Imperial Void Sect.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was linked in counteless ways with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, and it is extremely possible that he was the disciple of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. To Ling Han, making his way into the Imperial Void Sect is not his ultimate motive. What he really wanted to find out about was the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

When the master of the Black Tower died, did it have any relation with the three great Heavenly Venerates? Ling Han’s guess was yes. Otherwise, why would Small Tower be so incredibly wary about these three great Heavenly Venerates? Then what was the real truth?

Why had the Ancient Realm been split in two? A Heavenly Venerate couldn’t have possibly done something like that for no fathomable reason, right?

The large black dog had once said that the three great Heavenly Venerates treated the storm of darkness passively. What kind of attitude did these three mighty figures actually maintain?

There were a great many matters that he would only find out once he made actual contact.

He would use the Liu Clan as contact point, and enter into the Imperial Void Sect first, and then further enter into the Sealed Emotion Palace.

“Lord Clan leader, what should we do?” The moment Ling Han left, the members of the Liu Clan exploded.

“That guy must be a Dividing Soul Tier, and have astonishing battle prowess to be able to forcibly break through the formation.”

“Even if our strength was multiplied a hundredfold over, it would still be useless!”

Liu Huashan pressed his hands down, and said in displeasure, “What are you panicking about? Don’t we still have one last move to make?”

“Xiaoshan, go and pay a personal visit to send the news to the Green WIllows City.” He looked towards an elder. This was a third severance grand elder of Liu Clan, and the second strongest elite aside from him.

Liu Xiaoshan hummed and said, “But if I leave, what if the Kong Clan comes to attack us again?” Wth a third severance grand elder drawn away, if the Kong Clan came to attack again, the Liu Clan would be in danger.

“It’s fine. As long as that bringer of calamity is still here, the Kong Clan would definitely not dare to be rash.” Liu Huashan appeared to be brimming with confidence.

“Clan leader, that… is that really trustworthy?” someone asked.

Liu Huashan nodded, “With the ancestral records as proof, we are indeed the descendants of the Imperial Void Celestial King. However, it is rather hard to speak about. Our ancestor was birthed from an accident between the seventh generation grandson of Imperial Void Celestial King with a courtesan.”

Everyone gave an ‘oh’. No wonder Liu Huashan had previously been so unwilling to speak of the relationship between them and the Imperial Void Celestial King, so that was the case.

Indeed, this was really very embarrasing.

“All right, I will immediately set out.” Liu Xiaoshan nodded.

He made a prompt decision, and hurried towards Green WIllows City.

With his cultivation level, if he exerted all his effort, he would be able to arrive in eleven or twelve days. This was also why Ling Han had given the time limit of a month.

After Liu Xiaoshan arrived, he immediately used the Summoning Formation there to obtain contact witht he Imperial Void Sect. Originally, with his status, there was no possible way that he would be able to gain contact. However, he clarified his identity at the first moment, and the other would rather believe it to be truth than not, and thus helped him to find a powerful figure of the Sect.

The message was passed through multiple levels, and verified repeatedly. In a mere three days, the identity of the Liu Clan was confirmed.

They were indeed the descendants of the Imperial Void Celestial King, but their bloodline was already extremely and boundlessly distant.

However, the descendants of a Celestial King were still the descendants of a Celestial King. How could they be allowed to be slighted?

“Hehe, there is actually such an arrogant person. I really would like to see him for myself.” When they were in the midst of discussion whom they should send, a man dressed in green robes spoke u. He looked extremely young, yet had an overbearing air, as if even Celestial Kings would have to grovel in front of him.

Yulan Fenghua, the personal disciple of the Imperial Void Celestial King, and also his most beloved divided soul. At present, his cultivation level was Earth soul, and was a monarch among monarchs. It is said that he has inherited some portion of the graceful bearing of the Imperial Void Celestial King when he was young.

“Holy Son Yulan, there is absolutely no need for you to go, is there?” someone hurriedly advised.

Though Yulan Fenghua’s cultivation level was not very high, because he was too favoured by the Imperial Void Celestial King, even a First Heaven or Second Heaven Celestial King would have to give him some face.

He was too important. If anything happened to him, the Imperial Void Celestial King would definitely fly into a thunderous rage, and no one would be able to bear that kind of consequences.

“It’s fine. He can only be a Heaven soul, at most,” Yulan Fenghua stated carelessly.

Though he was only an Earth soul, he had defeated even Heaven soul monarch tiers before. It could be said that any Dividing Soul Tier would only be an ant in his eyes.

Because he was not only the Imperial Void Celestial King’s disciple, he had also obtained personal guidance from the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

That was a Heavenly Venerable Tier, what kind of character was that?

Reigning supreme over the heaven and earth, he naturally could make him so strong that even monarch tiers could only feel despair.

He did not believe that Ling Han was capable of matching him. It was just a spontaneous impulse that gave him the idea of making this trip.

The moment that Yulan Fenghua had decided, aside from the Imperial Void Celestial King, no other person could make him change hi smind.

“All right, then Holy Son Yulan will set out.”

Yulan Fenghua set out. He had a Flight Device, which the Imperial Void Celestial King had personally strengthened with Regulations of the Great Dao. Its speed of flight was astonishingly fast, and in a mere three days, he had arrived at the Green WIllows City from a boundlessly far location.

He contacted Liu Huashan, and they returned together to the Liu Clan. When he got the news, Liu Huashan immediately appeared together with the important figures of the clan, to receive the arrival of Yulan Fenghua.

“Welcome, Lord Holy Son.” The members of the Lord all paid their greetings respectfully.

Though they were the descendants of the Imperial Void Celestial King, their bloodline was too distant. Furthermore, they were birthed by a courtesan, so they naturally had even less confidence.

Yulan Fenghua was completely unconcerned. He had seen this kind of scene too many times, and it was absolutely impossible to make him feel any kind of feeling of superiority any more. He nodded casually, and said, “Where is that arrogant man?”

“Let me lead the way!” Liu Huashan hurriedly proclaimed.

Led by Liu Huashan, the members of the Liu Clan all followed, and charged grandly to where Ling Han was presently staying.

He actually dared to threaten the Liu Clan? F***, let’s see if we won’t kill you [email protected]
