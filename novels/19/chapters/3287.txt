Chapter 3288 - 3288: Taking Honey

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Amongst Ling Han’s group, there were four people with extremely high statuses. Even if they were only one of the many descendants of the Four Great Generals, obtaining a small warship was a sure thing for them.

The warships were fundamentally different from the flying machines of the technological civilization. They were driven by formations and consumed jade seeds as energy, unlike the flying machines that used various scientific principles.

Undoubtedly, warships were more suitable for this environment. This was because the magnetic fields in various parts of the world were very chaotic now. It was very easy for the instruments of the aircraft to malfunction, causing a plane crash.

However, even in the imperial capital, there were only a few warships, and they were strictly controlled. If it weren’t for the fact that Xuanyuan Dingguo and the others were powerful enough, it would be impossible for them to borrow a warship.

This warship wasn’t very big, and was of the same model as the one that Ling

Han had used to come to the Imperial Capital. However, there were only five of them, so they didn’t have to worry about not having enough rooms.

The cave was still quite far from the Imperial Capital. Even though there was a warship to traverse the vast lakes and mountains, it still took them seven days to finally reach the place.

On the way, they used their optical computers to watch the video captured by the drone that had entered the cave previously. They had a rough understanding of the place.

To Ling Han, this kind of exploration had already been exprienced countless times. Very quickly, he pieced together the entirety of the cave in his mind. He believed that even if he closed his eyes, he would still be able to walk from start to finish, and would definitely not bump into a wall.

The only thing he had lost was power.

The warship stopped, and they disembarked. The warship would wait for them here, and they would have to complete the rest of the journey on their own. The warship could not drive over.

Along the way, Yin Xiujing flirted with Ling Han in all sorts of ways. She would even enter his room at night and put on an alluring posture. However, Ling Han was always polite and extremely well-mannered, and did not lose his composure in the slightest, causing Yin Xiujing to be extremely depressed.

If this continued, she would really have to take off her clothes. How was that possible?

She only liked to play, but she wasn’t prepared to sacrifice her body or her looks.

She seriously suspected that Ling Han’s sexual orientation was abnormal. Otherwise, why would he be so cold?

After confirming this, her sense of failure immediately dissipated.

The five of them walked through the mountains. There was no road here at all, because there had never been any signs of human habitation. It was all dense trees and weeds, and the rocks were rugged. If not for the fact that they all had the strength of Blood Transformation Tier, just this last stretch of the journey alone would have sent them back where they came.

The biggest problem this brought them was their speed. It took them half a day to travel about 50km before they finally arrived at their destination.

In front of them, a sinister cave appeared.

“Is everyone ready?” Qin Xinghuo asked with a serious expression.

“Yes!” The other four nodded.

They all had a bottle of oil in their hands. This was specially made for Purple Wasps. After applying it on their bodies, they would not feel anything when they smelled it. However, Purple Wasps hated this smell the most. They would be able to smell it from afar and fly off long before they reached them.

“Let’s go!”

After rubbing themselves with oil, they entered the cave.

Because they had already seen the video, the five of them knew the situation inside very well. Even though it quickly turned pitch-black, no one panicked.

As expected, this kind of oil was very useful. They didn’t encounter a single Purple Wasp along the way. It was as if such Demonic Beasts didn’t exist here.

However, they did not dare to be careless, and turn on the optical computer’s lighting function. This was very likely to make the Purple Wasps go crazy and attack brazenly.

This was because they were getting closer and closer to the place where the honey was stored. To the Purple Wasps, it was their food.

Birds die for food, so the Purple Wasps would definitely fight them to the death.

The first floor of the cave was not big, so they quickly reached the end. The five of them took out their night vision goggles and put them on. They saw that there were discs on the cave wall in front of them, and the discs were covered in shiny sticky liquid, looking as if they were about to drip.

“Get ready,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said in a low voice.

“One, two, three!”

The five of them jumped out at the same time and removed the discs one by one.

Weng, there were Purple Wasps among the discs. They flew out after being alarmed and immediately attacked the five of them. However, the five of them decisively attacked and directly killed these demon bees without making any sound.

In just three to four minutes, they had plucked the discs clean. All of this was honey.

During this time, more demon bees returned, but they were all killed.

“Let’s go, we’re not far from the beehive rioting!”

The five of them quickly turned around. Each of them carried 20 to 30 discs on their backs, their speed astonishing.

After another ten minutes, they had already run out of the cave.

The five of them looked at each other and were pleasantly surprised. This trip was surprisingly smooth.

Weng, weng, weng. A disturbing sound came from the cave.

“Oh no, the hive has been alerted.”

“Let’s go!”

The five of them hurriedly ran back the way they came. In just a few steps, they saw a yellowish-purple cloud fly out of the cave. In an instant, it covered the sky and earth, circling around the mountains.

That was the Purple Wasps. Because there were too many of them, they all formed into what looked like a cloud.

Fortunately, these demon bees did not discover Ling Han and the others. After circling around the mountains for a while, they could only helplessly return.

When night fell, they returned to the warship.

According to Xuanyuan Dingguo and the other three, they were going to return now.

This was because even if they still had some specially refined oil, how could these demon bees not be on guard after their homes were raided?

Demonic Beasts had developed intelligence, and there were even existences in the Blood Transformation Tier, so their intelligence was definitely not low. Therefore, it was enough to harvest it once, and they should not be greedy.

“I want to go back again,” Ling Han said.

“Ling Han, don’t think that you can go a second or third time just because our first time went so smoothly,” Tang Yue said seriously. He was only saying this because of Xuanyuan Dingguo. Otherwise, who cared if he lived or died?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “My goal isn’t honey, but the Vermillion Fruit in the third level of the cave.”

“That’s right, you’re only at the First Change. You need this Treasured Fruit to increase your blood and Qi.” Qin Xinghuo nodded.

“I think it’s still too dangerous.” Tang Yue shook his head.

“It’s fine, I’ll be careful,” Ling Han said with a smile. “For this, I’ve made full preparations. Let’s meet again in the imperial capital then.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He insisted, and the four of them could not do anything about his decision. They decided to wait for him for five days. Five days later, they would start the warship and return to the capital.

Ling Han agreed and left alone.

Xuanyuan Dingguo and the other three didn’t give him a share of the honey or even mention it.

That was understandable. If they gave it to him and he died in the beehive, wouldn’t that be a huge waste?

Treasures that could be used to cultivate one’s physique were too precious and could not be bought even if one had money. It was no wonder that the four of them were “stingy”.

Ling Han did not take it to heart, because he had never intended to take advantage of the four of them in the first place, and had not contributed much. What right did he have to share the gains?

He could just go get it himself.

“Little Brother Han. you have to come back safely. Biz Sister hasn’t succeeded yet!” Yin Xiujing said delicately on the warship after Ling Han had taken a few steps.

Ling Han almost fell over. F*ck, this woman was too unreserved..
