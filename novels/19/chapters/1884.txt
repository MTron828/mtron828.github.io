Chapter 1885: Yielding Again

To Alchemy Apprentice Mo, giving in to Ling Han was also a great humiliation.

He was actually lowering his head to someone who had beaten him up and humiliated him! Just thinking about this made him feel stifled. However, he had already displeased Alchemist Zi Cheng once, so could he fail his task again?

He couldn’t endure Alchemist Zi Cheng’s wrath.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Aiyah, my legs feel so sore!” He retrieved a chair and sat down. He then crossed his legs, and his intentions were as clear as could be.

He wanted Alchemy Apprentice Mo to massage his legs!

‘Holy f*ck! How overbearing!’

Everyone’s heart thumped upon seeing this. Ling Han was far too audacious! He actually wanted Alchemy Apprentice Mo to massage his legs! One had to realize that he served Grandmaster Zi Cheng! Was Ling Han viewing himself as Grandmaster Zi Cheng the Second?

Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s face flushed red with anger.

‘You’re taking things too far! Way too far!’

“Ling Han, aren’t you going to leave yourself a path of retreat?” he questioned loudly. He felt incredibly vexed.

“What have I done?” Ling Han asked in a calm voice.

Indeed, Ling Han hadn’t said anything at all. Everything was simply Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s own interpretation and understanding. However, who didn’t understand Ling Han’s intentions?

Alchemy Apprentice Mo gritted his teeth, and asked, “Is this your condition?”

Ling Han smiled and didn’t say anything.

Alchemy Apprentice Mo almost exploded with anger. However, he had no option but to forcefully suppress his anger, contemplating what he had to gain and lose.

In the past, he had also acted on Alchemist Zi Cheng’s orders to invite other people. Which of them hadn’t been as excited as a monkey to receive Alchemist Zi Cheng’s invitation? Thus, they had only known how to thank him profusely. That being the case, he had also seized the opportunity to ask for some benefits from them.

However, Ling Han was an exception. He had directly targeted and provoked him!

Upon thinking of this, Alchemy Apprentice Mo truly started to feel regretful. If his attitude toward Ling Han had been even an iota better, none of this would have ever happened.

Unfortunately, however, he had treated Ling Han like he had treated those people in the past.

Time could be sped up, but it couldn’t be reversed. Thus, he had no opportunity to change his previous choices.

If he failed to complete Alchemist Zi Cheng’s order again, it was extremely likely that he would lose his favor. What did this signify?

Alchemy Apprentice Mo was well aware of what would happen. Although many people wanted to befriend him and curry favor with him, this was simply because he was Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice. However, he had also offended heaven knew how many people. Once he lost his status, what would await him?

He would definitely be killed by his enemies!

Upon thinking of this terrifying possibility, Alchemy Apprentice Mo couldn’t help but shudder in fear. He gritted his teeth and slowly walked forward.

‘It can’t be, right? Is Alchemy Apprentice Mo truly yielding?’

Everyone was transfixed with shock and disbelief upon seeing this.

As it turned out, this person was truly a sheep in wolf’s clothing! In the past, they had all been fearful of him because of his status. In reality, however, he was nothing but a paper tiger!

They all came to a sudden realization. It was because of their extreme care and reverence toward Alchemist Zi Cheng that they had even treated Alchemy Apprentice Mo as a high and mighty being. In reality, however, he was nothing more than a mere alchemy apprentice. Just how profound and powerful was Alchemist Zi Cheng? Would he truly be affected by a measly alchemy apprentice? Would his decisions truly be influenced by a measly alchemy apprentice?

Alchemy Apprentice Mo arrived beside Ling Han. Forcefully enduring the humiliation, he then bent down and started to massage Ling Han’s legs.

Ling Han didn’t tell him to stop, so Alchemy Apprentice Mo continued to massage his legs. Only after an hour did Ling Han finally stretch, and say, “Ah, my legs don’t feel sore anymore. Let’s take a walk.”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo breathed a sigh of relief. However, there was an ominous glint hidden deep in his eyes.

Once he completed Alchemist Zi Cheng’s order, he would definitely teach Ling Han a lesson. If he didn’t torture Ling Han into questioning life, his surname wouldn’t be Mo!

Ling Han noticed this, and he couldn’t help but smile, and say, “I’ve been frightened by your expression, so it’s probably best if I rest here for a while longer. I need some time to compose myself.”

He returned to his seat.

‘F*ck your sister!’

Alchemy Apprentice Mo almost spat a mouthful of blood. ‘You can’t toy with me like this! I only just finished massaging your legs in public, so you can’t do this to me again!’

He silently cursed himself. Why had he revealed his killing intent just then? More importantly, his killing intent had actually been seen by Ling Han!

“It’s best not to keep Grandmaster Zi Cheng waiting,” he hurriedly said.

Although this sounded like advice, it was actually more of a plea. Alchemy Apprentice Mo stopped just short of saying, “Grandpa, stop messing with me!”

Ling Han cast a long and meaningful glance at Alchemy Apprentice Mo. Only when Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s heart started to thump wildly against his chest did he finally say, “Alright, let’s get going.”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo hurriedly rushed over to help Ling Han up. His actions were so respectful and obsequious that everyone couldn’t help shake their heads. At this moment, did Alchemy Apprentice Mo still possess a shred of pride and arrogance? Sure enough, evil people could only be overcome by evil people.

However, Ling Han would definitely feel incredibly aggrieved if he knew of their thoughts. After all, how could he be considered an evil person?

Alchemy Apprentice Mo led the way, and Ling Han lazily trailed behind him. He had already placed the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden in the Black Tower.

It was always good to remain cautious. After all, what if his expectations were different from Alchemist Zi Cheng’s actual thoughts? If Alchemist Zi Cheng targeted him, he could indeed enter the Black Tower right away. However, what about his two beautiful wives?

As Ling Han and Alchemy Apprentice Mo disappeared into the distance, the others in the Alchemist Pavilion immediately launched into spirited discussions.

Once Ling Han visited Alchemist Zi Cheng, would the Alchemy City lose a young rising star?

Many people shook their heads in pity. They were convinced that Ling Han’s future was fraught with grim possibilities.

Although Ling Han had gained the upper hand in his tussle with Alchemy Apprentice Mo, the most critical factor wasn’t between the two of them. Instead, the final decision lay with Alchemist Zi Cheng. If Alchemist Zi Cheng was dissatisfied with Ling Han, this young rising star wouldn’t live to see tomorrow.

With Ling Han’s crappy attitude, it was hard to say what would happen.

Under Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s guidance, the two of them quickly arrived at the Transfer Formation outside the city. Alchemy Apprentice Mo enjoyed a fairly high status, so he didn’t need to use Star Stones to activate this Transfer Formation. The two of them were quickly teleported to the fifth level.

In reality, the fifth level was even smaller than the previous four levels.

Of course, this was only relatively speaking. In terms of absolute area, it was still astonishingly large. There were only 17 mountains here, and each of them housed a mighty figure. Even if they had descendants, they generally wouldn’t live together. Usually, they would only live with one or two alchemy apprentices or cultivation apprentices.

Thus, there were few people at this level. Gazing into the distance, one could only see blue mountains and green trees. This was a place that was brimming with vitality.

Alchemy Apprentice Mo led Ling Han to the seventh mountain peak. In terms of how these mountains were numbered, Ling Han wasn’t sure if it represented anything.

There were no paths on the mountain, so Ling Han and Alchemy Apprentice Mo directly flew to the peak of the mountain. There were no wild winds here, so even Severing Mundane Tier cultivators could easily reach the peak of the mountains. A small mansion appeared before them. This was truly a small mansion. Compared to the mountain peak that it rested on, it looked like a tiny speck of sand in a vast ocean.

“You can enter now. Grandmaster Zi Cheng has already been waiting for a very long time!” Alchemy Apprentice Mo said with a cold sneer. In his eyes, Ling Han was seeking death by making Grandmaster Zi Cheng wait for so long! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled calmly as he strode into the mansion. There was speculation in his mind, but this speculation had yet to be verified.

Alchemy Apprentice Mo didn’t follow him inside. Instead, he closed the gates and stood guard outside.

Inside the mansion, the most eye-catching area was an alchemy room. This was a room that could greatly speed up the flow of time. However, it could only do so by 100 times. This was already the absolute limit of four-star forces.

Ling Han glanced at it for a brief moment, and only then did he cast his gaze toward the elder who was calmly sipping tea in the center of the garden. His hair and beard were white, yet he was filled with vigor and vitality. This was especially the case for his eyes, which were filled with life and energy. He gave off a dignified and imposing aura.

“Brat, you’re fairly courageous, aren’t you?”
