Chapter 3463: Suppression of the stone statue

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There was a Monkeyman following them. Though he had already been dead for a great many years, his abilities were still superior to Celestial Path. He could be considered a powerful bodyguard.

Ling Han considered for a moment, and still decided to continue onwards.

He walked ahead, and the Monkeyman followed behind him.

The darkness was boundless, and there seemed to be no end to it.

After walking for a long time, Ling Han felt his vision blur, and there was already a person blocking his way.

To be more precise, it was a corpse.

Monkeyman.

Yi, weren’t you in a daze, and only knew to follow me? Why have you suddenly blocked my path?

Ling Han wanted to circle around, but the Monkeyman kept moving, always blocking in front of him.

Se??ch ?ew?o?e? / o?g o? ?oo?l?

‘What’s the meaning of this?’

Clearly, a Celestial level elite, even if he was already dead, was not someone that Ling Han could match.

The other was blocking his way, and Ling Han couldn’t get past him.

Could it be that it was extremely dangerous ahead?

This Monkeyman had never had any animosity towards him, and now, it suddenly stopped him. Perhaps, there would be great danger ahead, and that was why he had stopped him.

All right then. Ling Han nodded, and walked back. As expected, the Monkeyman did not stop him. Instead, just like before, it followed behind him shakily, like a walking corpse.

Er, this was a walking corpse.

Ling Han felt like he was really too carefree. Being followed by a dead Monkeyman, he was actually still in the mood to pay attention to this kind of minor problem.

Walking and walking, they soon returned to the plaza area.

“Father!” The seven toddlers all pointed at him.

“I know, I know,” Ling Han said with a nod. Behind him was a person with a gaping hole in his chest. Anyone who saw this would feel apprehensive.

“Don’t be nervous. This brother even saved me,” he explained.

The seven Calabash Brothers all gave an ‘oh’, instantly seeing this dead Monkeyman in a new light.

Second Baby stared at the monkeyman for a while, then said, “This guy once stood on the third level of Celestial Path. Tsk, tsk, tsk. He even formed a Silver Core, but unfortunately, it has already exploded. How strange. It has already died for so many years, so why can it still move?”

“Could it be that his lingering soul is so strong?”

The third level of Celestial Path?

No wonder there was still Celestial Path Tier-level battle prowess after death.

Ling Han rubbed his head. Could it be that he was going to bring the corpse of this Monkeyman that had been pierced through the heart out with him?

However, with a Celestial Path-level corpse following him, Ling Han couldn’t chase it away.

Sigh, if you want to follow, just follow. Who asked you to be so awesome?

Ling Han and the seven infants walked in front, while the Monkeyman followed behind them shakily.

When they arrived at the stone statue area in the center of the plaza, they saw that it had suddenly lit up ahead of them. That massive stone statue seemed to have come to life, exuding a golden brilliance.

This light dispelled the darkness, and also caused the gigantic stone statue to completely stand out.

It was about 450 meters tall. This was the image of a middle-aged man. His divine might was awe-inspiring, especially his eyes. Though they were carved from stone, they were bright and piercing, possessing an indescribable divine might.

“There is a boundary between life and death, and cannot be breached!” A majestic voice rang out. Boom, boom, boom, it was so loud that Ling Han’s ears were about to explode.

The golden light of the stone statue instantly lit up the entire plaza.

A look of fear instantly appeared on the Monkeyman’s face, and he continuously retreated until he had exited the plaza and entered into that area that was still dark.

When the Monkeyman had completely retreated out of the plaza, the light exuded by the stone statue also dimmed in an instant, returning to its original appearance.

Yi, could it be that this stone statue was specialized in suppressing evil?

This place was very strange. Corpses lay for thousands of miles, but the dead could stand, but there was a stone statue suppressing them, preventing the dead from entering into the realm of the living.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel curious. After a person died, was there really a place like the underworld?

Otherwise, what kind of place was this? What was the significance of this stone statue?

As he thought this, Ling Han turned around and left. If he had the chance, he would return to Haiping Mountain and make some queries with Brother Monkey.

It had been a long time since they had last seen each other. He wondered if Brother Monkey had escaped.

Ling Han returned to the end of this hidden passage. He exited, and after covering his tracks, he continued to walk along the tunnel at the bottom of the lake. After carefully walking for a long time, he finally reached the end of this tunnel.

The eight of them went out, and saw that a massive stone wall had appeared ahead of them. There was a massive painting engraved on it.

However, there were at least over a hundred corpses lying beneath the stone wall. Some had been beheaded, while others had been severed into two halves. It could be seen that the culprit was extremely cruel.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them. There were also three living people here, two men and one woman respectively. Their backs were facing him, and they were looking up at that stone wall, as if they were comprehending some supreme martial arts technique.

Hearing the movements of Ling Han and his group, the man in white among the three stood up and turned around. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yi, he looked familiar.

Ling Han faltered for a moment, then immediately recalled that this was the person he had seen when he had leaped into the ice cave in the lake. Because the other had just walked out of the tree hollow, he had only glimpsed him.

“Another person has come to die!” Tong Miao revealed a bloodthirsty smile, and strode towards Ling Han.

Ling Han frowned, and asked, “You killed all the people here?”

“That’s right, and you are also about to become their companion,” Tong Miao said. Once he saw blood, his killing intent would boil endlessly. If it was not for the fact that Dong Qi and Xin Ruyue were not weaker than him, the two of them could not possibly sit here peacefully either. Instead, they would already be dead.

Ling Han focused his gaze. There were shockingly six inscriptions inscribed in Tong Miao’s body, and there were also dozens of spots of light around him. This was obviously an Enlightenment Tier elite, andhe had broken through at Sixth Extreme.

If an Extreme Bone Tier cultivator could reach the Sixth Extreme, then when he was in the Blood Transformation Tier, he must have reached the Sixth Change as well, because the higher the cultivation level, the harder it was to break through the limits.

However, Ling Han was unafraid.

Even if the trial grounds no longer suppressed Tong Miao’s cultivation level, he still had Absolute Fairness.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “I don’t believe it!”

“So what if you believe it or not? I don’t care at all!” Tong Miao charged over, and delivered a swift slash with his sword.

In that instant, it was as if time had frozen. Ling Han once again saw the screen of light in his mind, and asked him if he wanted to pull down the other’s cultivation level.

“Reduce it to Sixth Extreme,” Ling Han said through divine sense.

Instantly, Tong Miao’s cultivation level dropped rapidly.

“En?” Tong Miao was surprised. He stopped in his tracks, and said, “So you are only an Extreme Bone Tier. Haha, a mere Extreme Bone Tier actually dares to have extravagant hopes of becoming a candidate for Young Dragon? It is better to let me slice you in half with a single strike, and end your fantasy.”

He charged out again. Even if his cultivation level had been suppressed to Sixth Extreme, he still thought that he could easily kill Ling Han.

Ling Han clenched a fist, wrapped in high-level energy, and shot out a punch.

Peng!

The fist landed on the blade of the sword, and instantly, an intense brilliance flickered. However, neither the sword nor the fist suppressed the other, and just like that, they were stuck in a stalemate.

Ling Han nodded internally. This Tong Miao was more or less the same as Hong Tianbu. They had both cultivated each cultivation level to the pinnacle, and when he faced off against Hong Tianbu, who was in the One Inscription state, even if he used all his techniques, it would only be a result of both sides wounded.

Thus, he decided to suppress Tong Miao’s cultivation level to Sixth Extreme, just in case. Sure enough, it was the right choice..
