Chapter 1710: A visitor from Hundred Magnificence City

The defending champion had been eliminated just like that, causing a commotion to rise up among the masses.

Was this cheating?

But none of the higher-ups of the Black Moon Sect naturally shared this thought. They were among those who knew that Ling Han had managed to fight Changsun Liang to a tie. If this kind of strength was still incapable of sweeping aside all his opponents, what justice would there be left in this world?

If Ling Han was weak, it would mean that Changsun Liang was weak too.

In the top 16, top eight, and top four there was not a single team that could match Dark Moon City. Those like Bian Zhe who had participated in the great banquet on Celestial Clouds Island, and had met Ling Han before, automatically admitted defeat. There was no need to even commence the battle.

This caused Mao Shuyu and the others to feel rather confused. In the qualifiers, they had still had a tough time in the competition, but why had it become smooth sailing now that they were in the finals?

This was really bizarre.

Yet they were increasingly excited because they only had to win one more battle, and they would become the champion!

Champion!

The last time they became champions was three eras ago, and the Dark Moon Team that was led by Mao Dai was similarly invincible and unmatched, but at that time, Mao Dai had at least encountered a few that could match him, which was unlike this time, where all the strong teams surrendered without even a battle.

Those who had made a wager could no longer sit still; those people were clearly cheating here.

They raised an objection to the gamble house, and because there really were too many people, it even alerted the higher-ups of the Black Moon Sect, and only then did news of that battle on Celestial Clouds Island spread out, and only with that was the dissatisfaction of the masses appeased.

So as it turned out... Ling Han was actually so powerful!

The opponent of the final battle for Ling Han and his team was Blue Flames City, where Dan Yujing was. This woman was indeed strong. Without Yuan Xingping blocking her way, the team she led had advanced through the competition like a hot knife through butter, charging all the way into the finals. Unfortunately, her next opponent was so strong that they could render anyone hopeless.

When the finals were here, a great many people came. The Holy Son, Changsun Liang, also arrived in person. It was possible that he would personally bestow on Ling Han and his team the prize for the champion—it was not all that generous, just a few Star Stones. What mattered was the prestige. There were not many people who would not be proud of becoming the champion.

To the forces under the rule of the Black Moon Sect, Black Moon City was a holy land. That feeling of achievement and honor of being able to win the first place in this place could not be described.

The match began, and Dan Yujing stubbornly did not choose to forfeit, but rather to battle with her full prowess.

Under her leadership, the team of 10 from Blue Flames City unleashed a gorgeous offensive, but against Ling Han, it was not of much use, as he easily suppressed it without much difficulty.

This final round was possibly the battle that had the widest gap in power between the two sides in history. In merely the time for a few breaths, the battle had concluded. And as expected, Changsun Liang stood up. He was going to bestow the prize on the winning team in person.

“Humph!” A figure suddenly shot out, his whole body completely enshrouded in Regulations, and entwined by great dao.

“S-Sect Master!” A great many powerful figures exclaimed in shock, and all those in Severing Mundane Tier knelt.

This was the sect master of Black Moon Sect, a Heaven Soul elite.

Yet the sect master of the Black Moon Sect did not look like he had any intention of paying them any regard at all. He raised his head and looked at the skies, his expression solemn.

Everyone couldn’t help but raise their heads and look at the skies as well. Right until at at least an hour’s time had passed, a massive starship appeared in the skies, casting a giant shadow on the ground. At the helm, a flag with seven stars was raised.

“Hundred Magnificence City!” someone immediately gasped.

Hundred Magnificence City, a Two Star City, was similarly under the rule of the Fu Clan. However, the territories of Black Moon City and Hundred Magnificence City just happened to border on each other. Thus, it was inevitable that there would be some conflicts between the two forces, and they were considerably intense at that.

Hundred Magnificence City was grasped in the hands of the Xiao Clan. This was a clan-type force, unlike the Black Moon Sect.

And now, the Hundred Magnificence City had suddenly sent out such a starship here. Was this a sign that there would be a massive war coming?

Xiu, two figures descended, and the one in the lead was an elder. He was similarly wrapped all over with the brilliance of great dao, and he held a young man in his right hand. When they landed on the ground, he finally released the young man.

The elder chuckled, and said, “Brother Tie, what need is there to be so aggressive?”

“Old Geezer Dong, what have you come for?” the sect master of the Black Moon Sect asked coldly.

“Oh, a boy that’s not too bad emerged in our Xiao Clan, and has never met anyone that could match him. I heard that the Holy Son of your sect is not too weak, either, so I brought him here to ask for some guidance,” the elder replied smilingly.

His name was Xiao Dong, a super powerhouse of the Xiao Dong and a Heaven Soul elite.

The young man beside him clasped his hands, and said, “This junior is Xiao Sheng. Greetings, milord.”

Though their visitor had ill intentions, the sect master of the Black Moon Sect naturally wouldn’t show his displeasure to a junior when his seniors were there. He nodded, and said, “Young man, you want to challenge Changsun Liang?”

“It is just a spar, so please allow it, milord,” Xiao Sheng continued, a smile appearing on his lips, bringing a slight hint of mockery.

Changsun Liang had been renowned for many years, and it was assured that the Xiao Clan was unaware just how strong he was, but now they actually dared charge right to their doorstep, and it was definitely not to seek their own humiliation. But the problem here was that Changsun Liang was already a super genius that would not appear in millions and millions of years; could Xiao Sheng be stronger than even him?

It could not be imagined.

“Perhaps this Xiao Sheng is really very strong, but it is absolutely impossible that he could reach the heights of the Holy Son.”

“That’s right. As long as he manages to endure a few moves from the Holy Son, he would naturally become famous.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“How cunning, actually planning to use this kind of method to quickly build up a reputation!”

“Humph, do they think that it is easy to last a few moves when fighting the Holy Son?”

“The best scenario is for the Holy Son to defeat him with a single move, and let’s see who would dare come again in future.”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly in soft whispers. Xiao Dong was a Heaven Soul elite; who would dare exclaim loudly in front of him?

“Oh?” The sect master of the Black Moon Sect showed a hint of a smirk. Clearly, he, too, thought that they only wanted to use Changsun Liang to increase their own fame. He turned to look at Changsun Liang, and said, “Liang’er, come and have a spar with this little friend, then.”

“Yes, Sect Master,” Changsun Liang agreed respectfully, and then strode out.

Xiao Sheng also took a few steps forwards, facing Changsun Liang directly.

“Circumstances do not look too good.” Ling Han’s expression was grim. He was not as optimistic as all the others. He could vaguely sense that this Xiao Sheng was extremely strong, and definitely in no way inferior to Changsun Liang.

He couldn’t really say why that was; it was just an instinctive feeling.

If Changsun Liang was in his best condition, then there wouldn’t be much of a problem. But the issue here was that Changsun Liang’s spirit had been wounded, and he would not be able to use his full battle prowess. Then, that would be dangerous.

Yet the Empress did not take it to heart. The only person she cared about was Ling Han. Putting aside the fact that Changsun Liang would lose, even if he was beaten to death right in front of her, it would not move her in the slightest.

However, since Ling Han cared, she, too, cast a few looks at Xiao Sheng, nodded, and said, “This person is indeed not inferior to Changsun Liang, and with Changsun Liang’s present state, there is no way he would be a match for him.”

She was not the type to beat around the bush with her words, speaking frankly whatever she thought.

Ling Han frowned, but this battle was already inevitable, because this was not only a battle to show who was stronger between Changsun Liang and Xiao Sheng, but was also the clash between two great forces which might perhaps decide the standing of the two forces in future.

Because these two people would become leading figures in their respective forces. Whoever lost the battle, it would lead to a lasting influence on their own force.
