Chapter 955: What Ghost?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s heart suddenly jolted.

All kinds of weird and bizarre monstrosities could appear in the Mystery Realm. Perhaps... it was nothing unusual for a ghost to appear.

However, curiosity killed the cat. He was brave and extremely curious, and thus he couldn’t help but creep toward that stretch of woods. He trod nimbly, and even drew his Divine Sword. His movements were especially careful.

After arriving at the edge of the woods, he lightly swept aside the tall grass. A sobbing white-robed person appeared in his view. The terrifying thing was, she actually didn’t have a head!

‘It’s really a ghost?’

Ling Han clenched the sword in his hand as a numb feeling spread across his body. This wasn’t a feeling of fear. Rather, it was one of excitement.

He had never killed a ghost before.

Xiu! He leaped forward, and his sword flashed down.

“Huh?” The white-robed figure suddenly raised her head... Who said she didn’t have a head? It was just that her head was buried too far down just then. Moreover, her arms had also been wrapped behind her neck, so he had only been able to see the white-colored cloth of her robes. As a result, Ling Han had mistaken her for being headless.

Hu Feiyun, the Ninth King.

The face of this young female was covered in tears, and her expression was also one of daze. Only when the reflection of the sword flashed in her eyes did her dainty mouth suddenly become slack. A stunned expression spread across her face, yet she didn’t even attempt to instinctively block or evade.

It was already too late for Ling Han to stop his strike, so he instead decided to push forward and send the tip of his sword scraping past the left side of Hu Feiyun’s face. A light breeze blew over, causing Hu Feiyun’s robes to dance in the air.

Pu, pu, pu, pu! After the Sword Ray slashed past, at least 100 towering trees behind Hu Feiyun came crashing down as they were cut down in unison.

Hu Feiyun was momentarily dazed before she suddenly came to her senses, and leaped to her feet. She wiped her tears, sobbing. “W-why are you attacking me?” There was an aggrieved expression on her pretty face.

‘This?’

Ling Han smiled bitterly, and said, “I thought you were a ghost!”

“I’m not a ghost!” Hu Feiyun exclaimed as she frantically shook her head. However, her expression suddenly became fearful, and she asked, “There are ghosts here?”

She was so frightened that she had already started to tremble. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ling Han was unable to fathom how a young girl like her could become the Ninth King and command respect from both the Left and Right Ministers as well as the Seven Generals.

He chuckled, and replied, “Probably not.”

“It means there’s a chance?” Hu Feiyun apparently liked to stubbornly delve into such ambiguities.

“Even if there are ghosts, there’s nothing to be afraid of.” Ling Han smiled, and said, “As the saying goes, a clear conscience should not be afraid when a ghost comes knocking.”

“Ah! Stop talking about it!” Hu Feiyun’s pretty face instantly turned pale with fear. “I’ve poured laxative into the spiritual liquid that I’ve served my sisters before. I’m going to be plagued by ghosts! Wuwuwu...”

Ling Han was rendered speechless for a short while. In the end, he could only try to console her, and said, “It’s fine. Such kind of action isn’t severe enough to attract the attention of ghosts. Do you think that ghosts are all so idle?”

“How do you know if ghosts are idle or not? Have you seen ghosts before?” There was a hint of curiosity on Hu Feiyun’s face as she continued to tremble in fear.

Ling Han was almost driven crazy by her. He hurriedly changed the topic, and asked, “Ninth King, why were you crying here by yourself? Where are your three guards?”

Hu Feiyun immediately started crying again upon hearing his question. “Ting Qin and Yun Rong... they’re both dead!” She sobbed. “Wuwuwu... They were only eaten by an evil beast because they were trying to protect me.”

Ling Han was startled by her words. Based on the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire’s fondness of the Ninth King, the three female guards that she’d assigned to her were definitely not ordinary. In addition to cultivation levels of peak stage low extreme, they had definitely also raised their battle prowess to the level of three—or even four—star geniuses through secret techniques.

However, the three of them were still no match for their opponent. Just how powerful was that “evil beast”?

Its battle prowess was at least at the high extreme. Perhaps it had even reached the late stage or peak stage of the high extreme. Otherwise, there was no way it could kill all three guards and leave no survivors.

If Ling Han came across such an existence, his only option would be to flee as well. There was still a chance that a Level Two Godly metal could be damaged by someone with a battle prowess of the high extreme. Moreover, his spirit hadn’t improved significantly, so the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique would most likely have little to no effect as well.

“Protecting you was their duty. Now that you’re safe, they’re also able to rest in peace.” Ling Han consoled her.

“Wuwuwu... But I’m still really sad.” Hu Feiyun sobbed as she wiped away her tears.

“Okay, okay. You’ll ruin your beauty if you keep crying.” Ling Han wasn’t good at comforting others. In addition, when compared to Hu Niu, it seemed like Hu Feiyun was the child, and Hu Niu was the adult.

However, it seemed like this remark was fairly effective on Hu Feiyun. She hurriedly wiped away her tears and straightened her face to keep herself from crying. She took out a mirror and looked at her own reflection. Then, an aggrieved expression appeared on her face, and it seemed like she was about to cry again. “I really have become uglier.”

“No, no you haven’t... You’re extremely beautiful!” Ling Han hastily took out some food and handed it over. “Here, have some food.”

If she was Hu Niu, she would definitely grin widely and forget whatever had happened. However, the Ninth King wasn’t a glutton, and her expression didn’t relax a single bit.

“Then just sit here and wait,” Ling Han said. “When the time comes, you’ll naturally be able to leave.”

“No!” Hu Feiyun immediately jumped up and grabbed onto his sleeve. “I’m scared! I don’t want to be alone!” She looked extremely pitiful, like a little girl who was trying to get things to go her way.

Ling Han found it hard to fathom that such a person could become a super elite who’d command seas and waves in the future.

However, the previous eight Kings had all broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier. Following this pattern, it was only natural that she broke through to the Heavenly Body Tier as well.

“Fine, then how about you follow me,” Ling Han said with a nod. He couldn’t stand Hu Feiyun’s eyes, which seemed like they could speak. Fortunately, this woman was more of a childish and naive type. If she was a flirtatious and enchanting type, she would definitely be able to bewitch someone to death.

Thankfully, he could pass her off to Shui Yanyu when he arrived at Crimson Lake.

Hu Feiyun breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing Ling Han’s words. However, she wouldn’t let go of his sleeve no matter what. It seemed like she was scared that he would suddenly run away.

Ling Han sighed, and brought the little bum beetle along with him. Luckily, they were quite close to Crimson Lake already, and the journey would only take one day or so.

“Chihu! Chihu!” After walking for a short while, a rugged mountain road appeared before them. At the same time, the harrowing call of a beast reverberated from the mountain peak. It seemed as if the beast was announcing its territory.

“It’s that evil beast!” Hu Feiyun instantly shrunk toward Ling Han in fright. “Don’t go over, you’ll be eaten.”

‘Can’t you say something more positive?’

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Our aim is merely to pass through this place, so we don’t need to clash with that Demonic Beast. We can try to make it through stealthily.”

Hu Feiyun frantically nodded in agreement. She was indeed very lacking in courage.

The mountains here rose and fell, and acted as quite the perfect natural shelter. The duo hid behind the many rocks as they passed through this mountain, and when they left, Ling Han saw a peculiar beast lying on the mountain peak. It had the figure of a wolf, yet there was a pair of gigantic black wings on its back. It also had three heads: one gold, one silver, and one red. Its appearance was incredibly bizarre.

Even though they were already so far away, Ling Han’s glance still triggered a reaction from the Demonic Beast. One of the wolf heads instantly looked over with an expression of disdain.

It didn’t move any further, yet another beast wolf by its side took flight. Its appearance was similar to the Demonic Beast, yet its size was much smaller. Moreover, it only had two heads, one silver, and one red. The silver head was also much smaller, reaching only half of the size of the red head.

The two-headed flying wolf soared toward Ling Han and Hu Feiyun. Behind it, there was a shadow of two mountains and a river.
