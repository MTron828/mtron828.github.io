Chapter 1481 Resolving the Formation Using Brute Strength

Cultivation could be boiled down to a single notion—those who were more powerful would achieve victory.

What did it matter if one didn’t understand martial arts techniques or secret technique? As long as they were powerful enough, they could still shatter heavenly bodies, galaxies, or even an entire universe with a single punch. That being the case, would there still be any unresolvable formations or unbeatable foes in the world?

When formation grandmasters resolved formations, they naturally approached it from the perspective of formations. However, Ling Han wasn’t a formation grandmaster, and thus he didn’t need to be limited by this thinking.

He threw a punch at the azure lotus before him.

Weng!

The azure lotus measured several thousand meters in diameter, and Ling Han’s punch sent countless ripples through the surface of the petals of the lotus. The force of his punch was evenly distributed over the entire lotus.

With this being the case, Ling Han couldn’t cause any damage to the azure lotus.

The Tranquil Heart Saint couldn’t help but shake his head. Would he have used this formation to examine his disciples if it were so easy to resolve?

‘You should follow the rules and use your knowledge of formations to resolve this formation.’

However, Ling Han wasn’t discouraged. The formation patterns inside his body lit up as he activated all 10 of the killing formations. He then unleashed their power through the Lightning Sword Technique as he slashed at the azure lotus before him.

Pu!

His attack was far more domineering this time. In fact, even the formation patterns of the lotus were unable to fully dissipate the power of his attack. A gash three meters long appeared on the lotus.

However, just the size of the lotus that was above the sea already measured tens of thousands of meters in height. Its width was more so several thousand meters in diameter. As such, how effective was a gash of a foot deep and three meters long?

Moreover, the azure lotus also possessed an extremely powerful recovery ability. In any case, wood-element beings were naturally strong in recovery. Azure liquid started to seep out from the wound, quickly healing the gash and forming a scab.

The Tranquil Heart Saint sighed in emotion upon seeing this.

On one hand, he was quite astonished by what he saw. This was because he was unable to inscribe 10 identical level formations inside his body, even as Saint who had achieved his dao through formations. Moreover, the might that was unleashed by the 10 formations inscribed inside Ling Han’s body was truly terrifying. Even he couldn’t help but nod in admiration.

If he could inscribe 10 formations inside his body, he would definitely be invincible among all of the Small Saints.

This young man was genuinely a supreme prodigy!

On the other hand, however, he felt that Ling Han was far too naive to use this kind of brute-force method to resolve the Ancient Azure Lotus Formation. How could he possibly succeed?!

‘This doesn’t work, either?’

Ling Han pondered for a moment before retrieving the Divine Demon Sword. He then slashed at the azure lotus again.

‘Sorry about this.’

This was a Celestial Tool, and although its might hadn’t been fully unlocked yet, the murderous aura that it released would still be powerful enough to kill whatever it struck. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Shua!

The formation patterns of the azure lotus were instantly slashed apart by the sword. Murderous aura burst into the surroundings, and the entire azure lotus shuddered before withering at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

The destructive ability of Celestial Tools was far too terrifying. Although the Divine Demon Sword wasn’t a genuine Celestial Tool yet, this was only the Immortal Realm, after all. Thus, its attacks were still devastating and fatal.

It wasn’t long before the azure lotus completely withered and died. Along with it, the formation patterns were naturally destroyed as well.

Tranquil Heart Saint: “...”

A string of curses raced through his mind. Ling Han had used the most unlikely method to resolve his formation. The Saint couldn’t help but feel astonished. At the same time, however, he also wanted to grumble and curse.

Fortunately, there weren’t any outsiders with him. Otherwise, if he had discussed this Ancient Azure Lotus Formation with them, and told them that it would be impossible to resolve with brute strength, he would definitely have had his face slapped right now.

‘This... What a freakish young man!’

Upon seeing Ling Han raise his sword and slash at another azure lotus, the Tranquil Heart Saint hurriedly shouted, “Stop, stop, it’s extremely difficult for me to nurture even one azure lotus!” He reached over and directly grabbed onto Ling Han. He then retracted his arm and tossed Ling Han onto the petal leaf of the azure lotus that he was sitting on.

Ling Han plonked onto the lotus leaf. This was clearly a lotus leaf, yet he still felt a sharp pain shoot through his rear.

The Saint had definitely done this on purpose.

‘Didn’t I just slash one of your lotuses? Is there any need for this? How petty!’

His expression also mirrored his thoughts.

Upon seeing this, the face of the Tranquil Heart Saint almost twisted in anger.

Were these azure lotuses ordinary lotuses? These were lotuses that could be inscribed with Level 16 formation patterns! As such, they were already nearing the Saint-level. In fact, they were only a small step away from becoming Saintly medicine. He had spent an exorbitant amount of time and effort to nurture these lotuses.

In any case, this formation wasn’t simply a formation to examine his disciples with. Rather, it also had another much more important use. That was, he could fuse these countless azure lotuses together and transform them into a Mother Lotus. By doing so, the lotus would break through to Level 16 and become a genuine Saintly medicine.

At that time, he could harvest the lotus heart and have the Hardship Alchemy Saint refine it for him. This lotus heart might then cause the barrier in his cultivation to loosen. If he were lucky, he might even be able to break through to the medium extreme!

However, Ling Han had just slashed and killed one of the lotuses. How could he not feel distressed?

Even so, there was nothing much that he could say or do. After all, it was he who had invited Ling Han to resolve the formation. Moreover, he hadn’t stated that he couldn’t use God Tools or other items. Thus, he could only swallow this result.

Ling Han was probably the first disciple to make a Saint feel so gloomy.

Ling Han clasped his hands in respect, and said, “Greetings, Saint!”

The Tranquil Heart Saint waved his hand in acknowledgment. He then forcefully suppressed his gloomy emotion, and said, “You’ve inscribed 10 Yinyang Five Element Formations inside your body?”

“Yes,” Ling Han replied with a nod. He knew that he couldn’t hide this from the Saint. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been summoned by the Saint in the first place.

“Your bones... are truly astonishing,” the Tranquil Heart Saint remarked. He couldn’t help but praise Ling Han’s Godly bones. Fortunately, he wasn’t aware that the toughness of Ling Han’s Godly bones would also increase as Ling Han grew stronger. Otherwise, his eyes would become green with envy.

He thought the Ling Han’s Godly bones were only this tough because he had ingested some natural treasure.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t explain this to him. He simply nodded, silently accepting the Saint’s statement.

The Tranquil Heart Saint wore a strange expression, and said, “You possess astonishing talent in cultivation, and your physique is also quite unique. Although you’re not very talented with formations, you were still able to achieve the notion of using your body as a formation to the extreme.”

Could it be that his most suitable successor was going to be this amateur in formations?

“I have high hopes of you,” the Saint continued. “In half a year, there’ll be a competition among all of the newly recruited disciples. If you win this competition, you’ll receive Saintly Origin as a reward.”

Ling Han’s heart thumped in excitement. Saintly Origin—this was a precious treasure that was formed when Saints used their power of construction to extract the essence of heaven and earth. Saintly Origin could elevate one’s cultivation, and it could even help with their comprehension. It was indescribably valuable.

Even Saints would have to pay a huge price if they wanted to refine Saintly Origin. Thus, they might not even be able to refine a block in several million years.

‘I must obtain this!’

“I believe this shouldn’t be too difficult,” Ling Han said with confidence.

The Tranquil Heart Saint couldn’t help but laugh loudly. However, he immediately shook his head, and said, “You’re far too confident. Perhaps you still don’t know that Gu Daoyi has already advanced to the Eternal River Tier. Moreover, his battle prowess is incredible. In fact, he can even battle against elites at the high extreme.”

‘Already?’

Ling Han was astonished. However, he immediately recalled that Gu Daoyi had once been a Severing Mundane Tier elite. As such, his cultivation level would naturally rise in a steady manner—at least before he reached the Severing Mundane Tier again. There was no way that he would come across any obstructions.

Moreover, he also possessed a Divine Fetus, and thus his growth would naturally be extremely smooth as long as he accumulated enough Origin Power.

Although Ling Han had inscribed 10 killing formations inside his body, the peak of their destructive ability was only on par with the early stage of the high extreme. Thus, it was unclear what the results would be if he were to battle against Gu Daoyi.

He... had to advance to the Eternal River Tier within half a year.
