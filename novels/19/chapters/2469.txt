Chapter 2470: Reunion

“It’s all right.” Ling Han shook his head, smiling. “Brother Yan, you need not be bothered about it. Aside from Yu Wudi, I have killed all the other six.”

Yan Xianlu was stunned. Even when he had broken through to the Celestial King Tier, he could only escape, but Ling Han was clearly still a Pseudo-Celestial King, and actually said that he had killed six of the Celestial Kings. This was too exaggerated, wasn’t it?

In a situation when the gap between cultivation levels wasn’t too wide, it was as difficult as ascending the heavens for a Celestial King to kill another Celestial King.

But was Ling Han the type to boast excessively?

“Brother Ling, you are too extraordinary!” The five great Celestial Kings could only be impressed.

Ling Han smiled slightly. If he broke through to the Celestial King Tier, his battle prowess would soar to the peak stage of the Second Heaven Celestial King Tier in terms of Regulations, and once the upper limit of his cultivation level was lifted in terms of Body Art, who knew just how strong he would be. This could only be known after he had advanced into the Celestial King Tier.

Speaking of the benefits this tower offered, Yi and the others were all overjoyed. It had not been very long since their breakthrough, and they were in need of stabilizing their cultivation level. This would be the perfect place for them to cultivate.

“We will go to the next tower, and after we conquer it and engrave a similar mark, there will be a resonance between the towers. By that time, you guys can make your way there,” Ling Han said. He had just been worrying about having no one to guard the tower for him.

“All right!” Yi and the others did not refuse.

Ling Han and his group departed, setting out towards the heart of the ruins. However, they did not progress on a straight path. Because of his promise to the Ninth Descent Celestial King, Ling Han did not plan to target the territory of this Celestial King. Otherwise, that would be really going too far, and would cause this Celestial King to return from the front lines just to suppress them.

At present, they were still no match for a Third Heaven Celestial King.

Under the restraints of the purple light, the battle prowess of Ling Han and his group fell drastically, but there was one exception.

Little Terror.

......

It could not benefit from the peculiar light or peculiar fragrance, but the restraints here had no effect on it, either, because it belonged to a completely different cultivation system.

Ahead of them, a great tree appeared. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This giant tree was extremely extraordinary. Though it was only 300 meters tall, the roots that protruded from the ground were like dragons, filled with power. The roots were all purple in color, with a slight translucent look to them, as if they had been carved from purple jade. Its full crown of leaves was like a multitude of spears, exuding a menacing killing intent.

And in between these leaves, there were some fruits that were as red as fire.

They were Subduing Purple Fruits. After consumption, one could resist the purple light for a short while, and the effects of Subduing Purple Fruit were really, really great in this area.

Ling Han and the others approached. No matter what, they had to prepare some Subduing Purple Fruits for themselves.

Shua, shua, shua.?It was like the great tree had come to life. Its leafy crown swayed gently, and several hundred leaves instantly shot towards Ling Han and his group at an astonishing speed. These leaves were shaped like spears in the first place, and now that they were shot out, they grew with the wind, and became nine meters long, looking like dark iron.

Ling Han took a step forwards, with both hands stretched out. He casually grabbed a streak of great dao, and turned it into a shield that stood protectively in front of himself and the three women.

The leaves descended, and this shield formed of Regulations immediately began to rapidly weaken at a visible rate, exhausting its energy at a shocking rate.

Peng, the shield very quickly reached its limits, and crumbled resoundingly, but Ling Han had already grabbed another streak of great dao, and continued to form a shield blocking in front of him.

They had already come close. The Empress and the others charged out, and even Little Terror rushed over, opening its wide mouth, and bit at the dragon-like roots of the great tree.

Boom, root after root darted out of the ground, and moved to ensnare the Empress and the others as if they were serpents. Every root was covered with purple seals, exuding a shocking might.

Battle immediately burst out.

Though the Empress and the others were very strong, this great tree was even more extraordinary. It was said that only a Third Heaven Celestial King could destroy the plant and pluck the fruits, which showed just how strong it was. Furthermore, there was purple light seeping all over this place, restraining everyone’s strength, and causing the great tree to become even harder to deal with.

Thankfully, Little Terror’s battle prowess was not affected. Its eerily white sharp teeth bit madly, and chewed off a considerable amount of wood shavings, so the great tree had to use the greater part of its power to deal with Little Terror instead.

Actually, Ling Han’s Body Art was not affected by the purple light, either, but the upper limit to his cultivation level had not been lifted yet, so his Body Art was only limited to 4999 Vitality Index points, which could barely be considered to reach the Celestial King Tier. In this place, there was limited room for him to perform. The present he had returned to his old habits of using Regulations as his main source of battle prowess.

Five great individuals of Celestial King Tier battle prowess fought against the great tree together, yet they did not gain the slightest bit of an upper hand. The great tree was really too strong, and would occasionally shoot out countless leaves, using them as arrows to inflict injury, which was difficult to defend against.

“F***, could it be that this damn tree has an endless amount of leaves? It hasn’t become bald even after fighting for so long!” Ling Han couldn’t help but complain.

Though the great tree was densely covered with leaves, shooting out several hundred of them with each attack, it should already be completely stripped bare after a few thousand times. But look, it was still lush and leafy, and did not show the slightest sign of becoming bare.

After fighting for half a day, the great tree suddenly shook, and dropped a few fruits, making no further move to attack.

What did that mean?

Not playing any longer?

Ling Han and the others stopped as well. Bewitching Maiden Rou picked Little Terror up; the little guy was still biting onto one of the tree’s roots, unwilling to let go.

“Though there are only four fruits, the sincerity is enough.” Ling Han picked up the fruits, and distributed one to each of them.

The great tree had not been outmatched, but rather chose to yield. It should be because it did not want to waste time on them.

Could it be that this tree had intelligence?

Ling Han smiled at the great tree. “Brother Tree, many thanks.”

The great tree swayed, as if casting disdain on him.

The four of them continued onwards. There were actually many plants here, but the majority of them had not borne fruit. Hence, Ling Han and the others had no intention of attacking them, either. They continued onwards, and after traveling for half a day, a seven-story precious tower appeared ahead of them, exuding a glimmering green light.

There were people in the tower, and they all drew weapons, appearing to be on guard.

“Are you the subordinates of the Ninth Descent Celestial King?” Ling Han called out.

This was diplomacy before violence, to avoid from beating on the wrong people.

Those guards exchanged looks, and shook their heads at the same time. One of them brandished the weapon in his grip. “All of you, please leave!” They did not flip out, mainly because they had spotted a Bewitching Maiden Rou, who was enshrouded in a peculiar ray of light. This was the symbol of a Celestial King, so it was natural that no one dared to be careless.

There was definitely a Celestial King standing guard here, yet he had not spoken all this while, and that was naturally because he had no wish to blow up the matter. As long as Ling Han and his group were willing to leave, he would definitely take no further action.

Ling Han nodded. “It’s great that you aren’t. I’d be sorry if I conquered another of his bases.”

He strode over, showing no signs of anger.

“Halt! Halt!” those guards all yelled, but they were not too nervous. After all, Ling Han was not a Celestial King, and he was alone. What need was there to take him to heart?

Seeing Ling Han approach, the guards moved at the same time, brandishing their respective weapons as they attacked Ling Han.

Ling Han cracked a grin, and power surged.?Peng, it was only a single punch, and those guards fell all over the ground, like the flowers scattered by a celestial maiden.

He took another step, and he already entered the precious tower.

Xiu, a frightening aura surged out, and a Celestial King flew downwards. His gaze was set on Ling Han, revealing a hint of coldness. He did not speak, but instead directly moved to strike at Ling Han.
