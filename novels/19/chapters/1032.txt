Chapter 1033: Caught Up

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Humph! The Regulations of heaven and earth are extremely chaotic here, so it’s genuinely an optimal place to battle!” Ju Yueyun chuckled, and said, “Hou Yang, if you don’t want to die here, then hurry and hand the item over!”

Hou Yang roared with laughter, and said, “Ju Yueyun, are you trying to scare this lord? You and I are both at the peak stage of the low extreme, and our battle prowess is similarly at two stars. If we battle with our lives on the line, it’s hard to say who will be killing whom!”

“I only know that if you don’t hand the item over, this will be the resting place for your corpse!” Ju Yueyun threatened in a sinister voice.

“Is this really necessary?” Hou Yang asked. “That item can’t be opened anyway. Are you really willing to bet your life and tens of millions of years of cultivation on some unknown item?”

Ju Yueyun flared up in rage, and said, “You and I discovered that item together, and we even agreed to examine it together. However, you took advantage of the moment when I wasn’t paying attention, and actually fled with the item! How can I swallow this anger if I don’t kill you?”

Hou Yang chuckled, and said, “I didn’t think that you would actually be so naive! No wonder you’ve spent all of your time on cultivation and been lonely this entire time. You’re stupid beyond belief!”

“Die!” Ju Yueyun roared in anger and lashed out at Hou Yang.

Boom!

Devastating flashes of light instantly exploded throughout the sky as bursts of overwhelming shock waves surged out from the battle. Like a giant mountain, a roaring wave that measured hundreds of meters tall crashed through the sea.

“F*ck! We’re going to be caught up in the shock waves from their battle!” Ling Han grimaced. Their luck was truly terrible. There were so many places that the two Heavenly Body Tier elites could have battled, yet they somehow managed to choose the sky directly above them. Weren’t they—two innocent bystanders—going to suffer for nothing?

However, now that it had come to this, their only option was to endure.

Ling Han held his sword in his hand as he stood at the bow of the ship and awaited the giant wave that was surging toward them. When the wave arrived, he gave a loud roar and ferociously slashed down, forcefully carving out a narrow gap in the wave and allowing their ship to pass.

Shua, shua, shua!

He continued to slash his sword down.

This wave was far too large, and each slash that he performed could only open a gap that ran 30 meters deep. He needed to continuously slash at the wave to ensure that it didn’t close in on them.

The ship finally sailed through the wave, and Ling Han was so tired that he could barely raise his arms.

The seawater here was extremely peculiar, with each drop being as heavy as a mountain. So, how terrifying was a surging wave? Moreover, the wave had been triggered by two elites at the Heavenly Body Tier, so it naturally contained a shred of the Heavenly Body Tier’s might. It was already a minor miracle that Ling Han had been able to navigate the ship through it, and it would have been beyond comprehension if he hadn’t been completely beat and exhausted.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Before Ling Han could even recover his breath, several new waves suddenly formed and started to surge toward them. Taking a quick glance, there were at least several hundred gigantic waves.

“Holy f*ck!” Ling Han wanted to give up and send the ship into the Black Tower. Meanwhile, he and Shui Yanyu could take cover underwater. They could resurface when the two elites finished their battle, then take their ship out, and set off for their destination again.

However, coming across a battle between two elites at the Heavenly Body Tier was a rare opportunity, and watching them battle would definitely be especially beneficial to his own cultivation.

Thus, Ling Han gritted his teeth and continued to endure.

He continued to unleash the 10,000 Techniques Return to One to slash the giant waves apart.

Fortunately, his power had also increased considerably along with the elevation of his cultivation level. Thus, although the might of the 10,000 Techniques Return to One was significantly reduced, its toll on him had also become much lower than before, allowing him to keep enduring.

Of course, the most important factor was still his sturdy physique and astonishing stamina. Otherwise, if he’d been an ordinary cultivator at the Mountain River Tier, his arms would have already become numb and limp.

Ling Han persevered, and under the strong intensity of the waves, his willpower was also steeled. A burning fighting spirit raged within him, and he felt as if he could even battle against an elite at the Heavenly Body Tier.

Meanwhile, the battle in the sky became more and more intense as both elites began to unleash their true powers. Dark clouds swarmed about, blotting out the sun. Then, in the next instant, flames seared through the air and transformed it into a sea of fire, appearing as if it were about to incinerate the sky and evaporate the sea.

Elites at the Heavenly Body Tier were far too powerful.

Ling Han felt as if he were a mere ant. No, he felt even worse than a mere ant. If either of the two people wanted to kill him, they would be able to do so with a single glance, not even needing to lift a single finger.

‘Power! This is true power!’

There was a strong hunger in Ling Han’s mind as excitement surged through his body.

He was unable to see the battle in the sky clearly, as the two elites soared about and unleashed their complete strength.

The sky was burning, and the sea was boiling... This place had become like hell on earth!

Fortunately, the two elites wandered further and further away from Ling Han and Shui Yanyu’s position. Otherwise, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t have been able to block the devastating shock waves that were being generated by their intense battle.

Boom!

An extremely thick column of light suddenly shot out from the sea and soared into the sky. Such was its astounding might that it could even be seen from hundreds of kilometers away.

Hou Yang chuckled, and said, “Ju Yueyun, a historical site was opened by us. Why don’t you head over and explore it? This lord won’t compete with you!”

“Bullsh*t! That site is only at the Sun Moon Tier! How can it compete with the value of that box?” Ju Yueyun roared angrily.

“It’s completely worthless. It can’t be opened anyway.”

“Then why are you keeping it? Give it to me!”

“This lord likes this kind of strange and peculiar things.”

“F*ck off!”

The two of them started to battle again, the intensity of their battle even greater than before. Blood sprayed from their bodies and instantly dyed the sky red, even transforming into a boundless blood rain that was brimming with terrifying killing intent.

Numerous creatures in the sea became unfortunate victims, dying violently as their bodies came into contact with the blood rain.

This was Heavenly Body Tier blood, and being struck by a drop of such blood was like being struck by a heavenly body 1 . It was extremely terrifying.

Ling Han had naturally placed Shui Yanyu and the ship into the Black Tower already, and he had also entered it himself. The surging waves carried them along, and they were submerged into the sea at times and were tossed into the air at others.

The Black Tower was like a mustard seed, and even the extreme weight of the gravity fields was unable to affect it. In fact, it was resistant to all powers, and thus the regulations in this sea were completely ineffective against it.

Xiu!

A small dot of light suddenly fell down from the sky.

Ling Han had a sharp eye, and he instantly determined that it was a white jade box. It plopped into the sea and then started to sink rapidly.

‘Is that what the two Heavenly Body Tier elites were fighting over?’

Ling Han’s heart thumped with excitement. He couldn’t snatch something from a Heavenly Body Tier elite, but this treasure had been knocked out of their hands now, giving him a chance to obtain it.

Though... it had landed quite far away!

Before Ling Han could even exit the Black Tower, Ju Yueyun and Hou Yang had already shot down from the sky and plunged into the sea. They continued to skirmish as they chased after the white jade box, and both of them wanted to break free and move in front of the other.

However, the gravity was immense here, and the jade box sunk at a tremendous speed. Ling Han lost sight of it in no time at all, and the two powerful elites also disappeared from his sight in a flash.

Meanwhile, the Black Tower continued to drift along the sea, unseen and undetected by others.

Ling Han’s mind whirred, and he finally made a decision. He resolutely leaped out of the Black Tower. An overwhelming weight instantly bore down on him, dragging him deeper and deeper into the sea.

This was exactly what he wanted.
