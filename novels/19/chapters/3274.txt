However, the result was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Ling Han was very resistant, so much so that a certain someone began to despair.

Hu Yang realized that he could not hold on any longer.

Channeling the Destruction Claw was also a huge consumption for him. Normally speaking, he had to achieve success in ten minutes. It was similar to the eruption of his boiling blood and Qi.

But now, Ling Han had already endured for a full 15 minutes.

Hu Yang immediately felt immense pressure. He could no longer maintain his use of the Destruction Claw.

If this continued, he would lose.

He was shocked. Before this, how could he have thought that he would lose to a Meridian Opening Tier cultivator?

There was only one person who had accomplished such a feat, and that was Hong Tianbu!

Could it be that he really was going to become a stepping stone for Ling Han?

It had to be known that the Fifth Change who had lost to Hong Tianbu back then was still a big joke to this day. Although Hong Tianbu was now very influential, there was still no one who thought highly of him.

He didn’t want to be the second one!

But what other ultimate move could he use?

This time, he was only here to stomp on the new students’ spirits and take in some underlings. Naturally, he could not make any preparations and bring along Talisman Weapons and Spirit Tools. Therefore, he did not even have a trump card to turn the tables.

‘What do I do? What do I do?’

Hu Yang’s heart was beating fast, but he could not think of any ideas to turn the tables.

“Stop!” he shouted.

However, how could Ling Han pay any attention to him? His figure floated non-stop, and his fists swung repeatedly, giving Hu Yang immense pressure.

Why was this brat so shameless?

Hu Yang roared, “I’m not feeling well today. I’ll fight you again in the future!”

He had already boiled his blood and Qi, but as long as he could erupt again, suppressing Ling Han would naturally be as easy as flipping his hand.

It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge. Besides, if he continued to fight, he might be beaten up by Ling Han. He believed that Ling Han would do such a thing.

Xiu, he turned around and ran. With a sonic boom, he instantly disappeared. He ran away!

The members of the Hu Clan Gang were all dumbfounded. Their boss had actually abandoned the battle and ran away.

This was too unbelievable. One had to know that his opponent was only in the Meridian Opening Tier.

The expressions of those who knew about Hong Tianbu changed drastically. They thought of a possibility. Perhaps, a second Hong Tianbu would appear in the academy. He could rule supreme and make everyone have to rely on him.

Tuoba Tianhuang gritted his teeth with a menacing expression.

…He had been easily defeated by Hu Yang, but Ling Han was able to beat Hu Yang away. Although it was because Ling Han had used a devious scheme, it was still undeniable that there was a huge gap between the two of them. Was he even worthy of being called a prodigy? In front of someone like Ling Han?

No, he was unwilling to admit defeat. He wanted to become stronger!

If a Fifth Change could not defeat Ling Han, then he would advance into Extreme Bone Tier. If the Extreme Bone Tier was still not enough, then he would advance into Inscription Tier. He believed that as long as he had a crushing advantage in cultivation level, no matter how strong Ling Han’s battle prowess was at the same cultivation level, he would definitely be no match for him.

As soon as Hu Yang left, the members of the Hu Clan Gang were stunned for a moment before naturally leaving one after another.

Who would dare to provoke Ling Han?

Ling Han did not pursue. He did not even look at Tuoba Tianhuang. Instead, he walked to Lian Xuerong’s side and asked, “Banner Lord Lian, are you alright?”

“It’s alright.” Lian Xuerong nodded. Hu Yang saw that she was beautiful to the bone and had some evil thoughts. Naturally, he wouldn’t bear to severely injure her.

“Thank you, Ling Han,” she said seriously.

She really didn’t expect that after such a short period of time, the youngsters she brought over from the truly desolate countryside had already blossomed with boundless brilliance. In fact, they had even left her in the dust.

One had to know that Ling Han was only in the Meridian Opening Tier. If he advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier, how strong would he be?

Could it be that he was really comparable to that omnipotent person in fluttering white clothes?

Lian Xuerong was a little dazed. There had always been someone in her heart who was like a god, but now, this person was dimming. After all, she had only seen him from afar, and had mostly only heard of his legends, unlike Ling Han, who was within reach and even standing up for her.

“Banner Lord Lian, have a good rest,” Ling Han said. He wanted to continue refining his body. This was the most important thing.

One day later, the news of Hu Yang being beaten up by Ling Han to the point of fleeing had already spread throughout the academy, instantly causing a huge uproar.

Hu Yang was not an ordinary Fifth Change, but a prodigy who had once cultivated to the limit of the Meridian Opening Tier, and had even cultivated Body Arts. Now, he possessed nearly 1.5 million kg of power, yet he had actually lost to Ling Han.

Hiss, why did this sound so familiar?

Hong Tianbu!

A figure flashed across everyone’s mind. This was a miracle that could only be created by Hong Tianbu.

However, among the true overlords of the academy, Ling Han could only be considered to have just risen.

“The rumors are too ridiculous. What second Hong Tianbu? Hehe.” Xuanyuan

Dingguo smiled. He was the son of one of the four generals, by the title of Xuanyuan. General Xuanyuan was also the only one among the four generals who was bestowed a title using his surname.

Beside him, a young man stood solemnly. When he heard this, he also smiled and said, “Although Hu Yang can’t be considered a top-notch expert, his abilities aren’t weak either. To be able to beat him away, that Junior Brother Ling has some skills.”

“And he’s very scheming.” Xuanyuan Dingguo laughed. “He actually let Hu Yang consume the opportunity to boil his blood and Qi in a muddle-headed manner. This is a matter which Hu Yang will really be laughed at for the rest of his life.”

Another young man also laughed. “Fortunately, it’s not a life-and-death battle. Otherwise, Hu Yang’s reputation would be tarnished for ten thousand years even if he died.

His name was Bei Hege, and he was Xuanyuan Dingguo’s capable subordinate. The old master of the Bei Clan was also a commander under General Xuanyuan, and his bravery was outstanding.

Xuanyuan Dingguo tapped his fingers and said seriously, “However, a Meridian

Opening Tier cultivator can fight off a Fifth Change Blood Transformation Tier. No matter how you look at it, our Little Junior Brother Ling is very powerful, and his potential is astonishing. He’s worth nurturing.”

“You think well of him?” Bei Hege asked.

“Haha, Hong Tianbu has been invincible for too long. Wouldn’t it be interesting if there’s a second Hong Tianbu?” Xuanyuan Dingguo laughed.

Bei Hege was surprised. “Although our junior brother has already displayed extremely freakish strength, there’s only one Hong Tianbu!”

In the world, there was only one Hong Tianbu, because his talent could no longer be described as prodigy or freakish, but as suppressing the heavens. There could only be one such person.

“It doesn’t matter. Let’s make friends first and see in the future,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said. “You can represent me and pass on the goodwill of the Xuanyuan

Clan. ”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Alright.” Bei Hege did not say anything else. Since Xuanyuan Dingguo had already made his decision, he could only do it. He was a qualified subordinate.

His eyes were filled with respect. In fact, Xuanyuan Dingguo was also an impressive prodigy. It was just that the people of this generation had been suppressed too miserably by Hong Tianbu. No matter how radiant you were, in front of Hong Tianbu, you were like the light of a firefly. How could you compete with the sun?

It was unfortunate that he was born at the wrong time, he sighed in his heart. Even that Junior Brother Ling was the same. Now that Hong Tianbu was in charge, any prodigy could only be overshadowed..
