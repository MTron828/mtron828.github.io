Chapter 1961: Regulation of Slaughter

A person had appeared ahead of them.

However, it was really very difficult to use the word “person” to describe him. He could only be considered a human-like figure. His body was covered with sharp spikes of varying width, some thinner, and some thicker, appearing very bizarre.

These spikes were completely unlike adornments, but rather seemed to be growing directly from his body, and looked very natural.

Ling Han and his group were surprised. This human figure had to be a being of the Three Blooms Valley. Otherwise, they definitely had not seen such a monster come in with them, and one that had managed to rush ahead of them at that.

This place was actually capable of nurturing living beings?

They did not hear Yan Xianlu speak of this.

Ling Han did not think that Yan Xianlu would deliberately hide this kind of information. Of course, it was also impossible that the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King had deliberately concealed it from his beloved disciple. Then, there was only one reason, and that was this monster had been birthed only in the last 100,000,000 years.

It could be tens of millions years ago, or hundreds of thousands of years ago. In fact, it could even be as recently as three to five days ago. How could the mysterious and profound nature of nature be easily guessed?

“...And whom are the war drums made for?” this human-like monster continued, his voice very low. Accompanied by the tone that he was using, he seemed like an old soldier that had lived through many battles, relating his reflective thoughts of war.

“Stupid monster, why are you acting all mysterious? Isn’t it just because you want a fight? Come, Niu will oblige!” Hu Niu called out loudly, but before the human-like monster made a move, the Empress had already charged out. Boom, she shot out a punch, and Sword Qi danced madly.

“Wayaya, you are so despicable, this is Niu’s!” Hu Niu stomped in fury, and charged out as well, attacking that human-like monster.

Now that she had made a move, the strength of the human-like monster was clear to see.

Yang soul.

Against Severing Mundane Tier, this should be completely one-sided. Unfortunately, whether it was the Empress or Hu Niu, neither of them were ordinary Severing Mundane Tier, but rather fifth severance monarch tiers!

In terms of cultivation level, they were equivalent to Yang soul, and in terms of battle prowess... they could still be invincible in a battle against an opponent that was one cultivation level higher than them.

Which also meant that they could defeat even Yin soul elites.

Under the combined forces of these two women, how was this human-like monster supposed to resist? Peng, peng, peng. In a chaotic tussle, he was very quickly beaten up.

What was strange was the fact that this human-like monster did not have a body. Under the masses of spikes, the body was actually empty. There was only a crimson stone that was like its heart. However, it was only as big as a segment of a pinkie.

“Why do you have to fight with Niu?” Hu Niu was not willing to give up the matter, and glared at the Empress.

The Empress, meanwhile, couldn’t be bothered to give her any regard, looking like she was treating her like a child, so she would not lower herself to Hu Niu’s level.

“Despicable witch!” Hu Niu stomped in fury, clinging onto the Empress tirelessly. She was determined to get a reply. There were times when she was really very obstinate.

Ling Han, meanwhile, picked up that crimson stone. However, his hand had just touched it when a boundless red immediately surged out in his mind. Shadows of swords and blades presented a complete massacre.

‘Hmm?’

He immediately showed an expression of shock, and exclaimed, “Regulation of Slaughter!”

The Black Tower also contained Regulation of Slaughter, and he had attained a superficial comprehension thereof, so he was not the slightest bit unfamiliar with this Regulation of Slaughter.

The Empress was immediately interested, and came closer to see.

“Hey, hey, hey, witch, you haven’t said why you have to fight with Niu yet?” Hu Niu said, unrelenting.

“Regulation of Slaughter?” Bewitching Maiden Rou also approached, similarly filled with interest. “You’re saying that this contains the Regulation of Slaughter?” The Regulation of Slaughter was outside of the Five Elements and Lightning. Usually, there would completely be no chance to study it, so it was incredibly precious.

Ling Han glared at her, and retorted, “Even if there is, it’s none of your business.”

Bewitching Maiden Rou was irritated. This unromantic rude boor, she really wanted to strangle him.

Ling Han tossed the stone to the Empress. He had the Black Tower, and could study the Regulation of Slaughter at any time, so he did not need this kind of thing.

The Empress would naturally not act reserved with him, and put the blood-colored stone away.

Bewitching Maiden Rou pouted slightly. She, too, wanted it, but Ling Han didn’t even bother to ask her. He really was despicable.

“Witch, Niu is speaking to you!” Hu Niu was abruptly still unwilling to give up.

With Hu Niu constantly pressing for an answer, they walked ahead for about two to three miles, and another human-like monster covered completely with sharp spikes appeared again.

Hu Niu screamed, and hurriedly made the first move to attack. Very soon, she killed this monster.

As expected, the sharp spikes fell, and it was completely empty inside, except for a small stone that was as red as blood.

“It’s still Regulation of Slaughter.” Ling Han nodded, and then tossed the stone over to the Empress again.

Because the valley had become completely even here, and there was nothing resembling a path, but it had rather become a massive plain, they were like stones that been thrown into the ocean, not creating even the slightest ripple.

Everyone would definitely have chosen a different direction, and after walking for an extended distance, this difference would be huge. Thus, Ling Han and his group did not catch up to the people ahead of them, nor were they surpassed by those behind them.

Whether they were still in the lead, or had fallen behind, they had completely no idea.

“Hu! Hu! Hu!”

A strange animal sound rang out, and a weird Demonic Beast appeared ahead of them.

From the looks of it, it should be a hog, but it was similarly covered with sharp spikes, which instantly made its size double, giving off a twisted feeling of pressure.

“I’ll go!” Bewitching Maiden Rou was the first to move. If this monster was still killed by Ling Han, the Empress, or Hu Niu, she would not be able to bring herself to ask for a share of the precious gems that contained the Regulation of Slaughter.

But if she took the initiative to attack first, then even if she would only be watching from the sidelines for the rest of the battle, she could still bring herself to shamelessly ask for a share of the loot later, right?

She moved directly. Her slender hand shook, and a wooden sword appeared in her hands, which she slashed out towards the Blade Hog.

Xiu, Sword Qi surged out, turning into a brilliant light.

This strike was struck on the Blade Hog, but not even a single spike had been severed. Instead, it made this Blade Hog focus on her, and a murderous aura instantly surged over. Bewitching Maiden Rou’s beautiful face paled, and she almost passed out.

This was Regulation of Slaughter, which was incredibly frightening.

Even Ling Han’s expression changed immediately, and he exclaimed, “Not good, this thing is Earth soul-level!”

Hong, long, long, the Blade Hog charged towards Ling Han and his group in a flurry of its hooves.

“Come, let’s give it a try!” Ling Han’s fighting spirit was ignited, and he greeted it with a punch. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Peng!

Ling Han was immediately sent flying, so fast that his figure was like a cannonball that had been shot.

Ling Han had been sent flying for close to several hundred miles before he finally managed to slow himself down. He saw that the part of his robes covering his abdomen had been torn, revealing a circular wound, and traces of blood had also appeared on his abdomen. He had actually suffered injury from this blow.

Earth soul-level battle prowess was indeed terrifying.

Ling Han rubbed his abdomen, and gritted his teeth. As expected of Regulation of Slaughter. Otherwise, merely Earth soul alone would not have been able to damage his physical body so easily.

This little injury was not enough to drive him into a breakdown, but the problem was that his attack was far inferior to his defense. Fighting with this Blade Hog only meant that he would be barraged with attacks, so what was the point?

Flee? Hide into the Black Tower?

Ling Han shook his head. In a motion of space teleportation, xiu, he instantly appeared in front of that Blade Hog. He drew the Divine Demon Sword, and delivered a strike. Weng, majestic light unleashed in all directions as Sword Qi filled the skies.

The Blade Hog naturally would not be afraid. With a shake of its body, xiu, xiu, xiu, countless spikes shot out, blasting towards Ling Han.

In that short instant, this Blade Hog had turned into a naked hog.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and lightly said, “Time, stop!”

Weng, whether it was the Blade Hog, or the spikes and blades that were filling the skies, they all entered into a paused condition at the same time.
