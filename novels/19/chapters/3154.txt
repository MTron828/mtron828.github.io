3155 Taking down a notch

This was a psychedelic formation, and it was extremely simple. It could only target Meridian Opening Tier elites, and if one had attained the Blood Transformation Tier, they would be able to influence the power of heaven and earth with a single punch, thereby breaking through the formation.

“This would require thirty-six basic formation patterns to be inscribed on the nine formation foundations. When inscribing formation patterns, one would also need to instill spiritual power into the formation patterns. Otherwise, those would only be dead patterns.”

“I’ll try it out with ordinary wood first.”

Ling Han had already learnt these thirty-six formation patterns, but because all the formation patterns would slowly disappear in his mind, he first studied the corresponding formation patterns carefully before inscribing them.

Then, he stimulated his spiritual power and began to carve on the wood.

One, two, three… after drawing nine formation patterns, the spiritual power that he had recovered with great difficulty was once again exhausted, and he could only stop to rest.

At night, a soldier came over and informed Ling Han that he would report to the base of Xuanqing Banner tomorrow morning.

Ling Han pondered for a moment and decided to take a good rest.

The next day, Xuanqing Banner’s base, Team Seven.

The eight team members all looked towards the entrance of the camp, as if they were anticipating someone to come.

“Today, the new deputy captain is coming.”

“Hehe, I really want to see how handsome this guy is, to actually be able to enchant even our Banner Lord.”

“We definitely have to take him down a notch, and make him retreat in the face of difficulties. Without true strength, to say nothing of being our captain, he wouldn’t even be qualified to join Xuanqing Banner.”

“That’s right!”

A sturdy man of about thirty-five or thirty-six years old nodded, “Little Zhang, later, you go and challenge this deputy captain!”

“All right!” A young man who looked to be in his twenties nodded, while the others crossed their arms over their chests. They were sure that Zhang Honglang would be enough to deal with him.

At this time, a young man appeared at the entrance to the base camp. It was Ling Han.

“Is it that brat?”

“Probably. I’ve never seen him before, and he fits the description as well. He looks to be in his late teens.”

“All right, let’s wait for him to come.”

The camp of Xuanqing Banner was very large. Though there were only about a hundred people in the whole camp, and even with the support staff, there would not be more than two hundred, this camp took up about ten acres of land.

Ling Han strode forwards, heading towards where Team Seven was. There was absolutely no need to worry that he would not be able to find the location, because there was a flag erected where every team was located. On it were the words “First Unit”, “Second Unit” and so on.

“So you are Ling Han?” Eight men of varying ages approached.

Ling Han swept an eye over them, and said calmly, “If I’m not wrong, you guys are members of Team Seven, and if I remember correctly, I just happen to be your deputy captain.”

He paused, then continued, “Is this how you guys greet the deputy captain?”

“Hehe, if you want to be our deputy captain, you have to first obtain our approval. Otherwise, you would only be nothing in front of us,” a sturdy man in his thirties said.

“That’s right, the deputy captain should be our Brother Liu instead!” the youngest young man, Zhang Honglang, said.

This Brother Liu was called Liu Jing, and his cultivation level was Eleven Meridians. He had been in Team Seven for close to ten years, and was extremely experienced. Furthermore, he was a very loyal person, so he had naturally gained the support of the other team members.

“Oh, so you guys are going to take me down a notch?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“This isn’t called taking you down a notch. We only want to spar with the deputy captain,” Liu Jing said with a smile. He was extremely dissatisfied. Their former deputy captain had been killed in the beast suppression mission not too long ago, so he was naturally very upset about it.

However, in terms of seniority, he should be the deputy captain, and not this young man that had popped out from who knows where.

Ling Han took a look. The captain of Team Seven was Tang Hai, whom he had known since long ago at Sealed Mountains, but now, Tang Hai had not appeared. What did this mean?

The other party must have known that his subordinates would target Ling Han, yet deliberately avoided revealing it. It was obvious that he wanted Ling Han to solve this problem himself.

There was only one way to win the respect of these warriors—strength.

Thus, even if Tang Hai appeared and helped Ling Han resolve this “rebellion”, these people would stop causing trouble now, but what about in the future? Would they submit to Ling Han?

Ling Han smiled faintly. Since that was the case, then let’s battle.

“Who’s going to attack first?” he asked as he looked at the eight people.

“Me!” Zhang Honglang called out.

“Since I’m the deputy captain, I’ll let you have the advantage of one hand.” Ling Han clasped his right hand behind his back.

Zhang Honglang was instantly enraged, and shouted loudly, “I don’t need you to give me an advantage!”

“Hehe, make your move.” Ling Han crooked a finger at his opponent with his left hand.

Zhang Honglang hesitated for a moment before resolutely saying, “You asked for this.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Peng, with a stamp of his feet, he charged towards Ling Han.

Ling Han shot out a fist, greeting the other’s attack.

Peng, the power of the blows clashed, instantly forming a shockwave that spread out in all directions.

In this exchange, the two of them were evenly matched.

“Yi, this brat can actually fight Little Zhang to a tie?”

“He’s not as weak as the rumors say.”

“However, Little Zhang hasn’t used overlap yet. Once he uses it, that brat would definitely be no match.”

“He came from a remote village, after all.”

Tang Hai and the others had all said it. They definitely did not believe that Ling Han could defeat Zhang Honglang. Even just a tie was definitely impossible.

Zhang Honglang’s attacks were extremely fierce. He used both fists and kicks, and every move was a technique to kill.

This was very normal. If soldiers did not cultivate the art of killing, what was the point of cultivating?

Ling Han casually responded. Since they would all be his soldiers in future, he decided to go easy on him, so that he would not lose too badly.

The two of them were just embroiled in a lively battle when they suddenly heard a commotion coming from the entrance of the camp. There were also a great many people running towards that direction.

What had happened?

“Little Zhang, stop first,” Liu Jing said.

Zhang Honglang stopped as he said. He turned around and asked, “Brother Liu, what is it?”

“Something seems to have happened!” Liu Jing waved his hand, “Let’s go and take a look.”

Huala, in an instant, all eight of them ran towards the entrance of the camp.

What was this?

Ling Han stroked his chin. This was a little awkward. He was just left out like this?

He also strolled towards the entrance of the camp. He had just arrived there, when he saw a figure fall down from the skies. Pa, the figure just happened to land at his feet.

“Hahahaha, Xuanqing Banner is really led by a woman, nothing but a bunch of spineless b@stards!” A voice rang out, instantly causing the dozens of soldiers at the entrance of the camp to all look furious.
