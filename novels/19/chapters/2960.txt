2961 Unforeseen event

Since when was a Sixth Heaven Celestial King capable of being so powerful?

That Eighth Heaven Celestial King also faltered upon seeing this. He hadn’t imagined that Ling Feizhou’s strength would be so formidable. Although he hadn’t unleashed his full power, that attack still shouldn’t have been blocked by a Sixth Heaven Celestial King.

How strange.

He frowned slightly. “Ling Feizhou, as expected of the descendant of that person. I have underestimated you.”

The rumored traitor was incredibly freakish, and winning battles against opponents that surpassed him by two or three levels was par for the course for him. Unexpectedly, his descendants were also the same.

!!

Ling Feizhou soared into the skies. His expression was also one filled with shock because he himself was the clearest about his own abilities. It was definitely impossible that he could rival an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

Therefore, it was either that the Eighth Heaven Celestial King was deliberately acting, or that there was an elite secretly making a move.

But who would help him?

Ling Feizhou couldn’t figure it out, but as a Sixth Heaven Celestial King, he naturally wouldn’t lose his composure, and his face remained calm. “Sir, you have really misunderstood.”

“Misunderstand what? Die!”

That Eighth Heaven Celestial King made a resolute move. Using the Celestial King technique, his whole body was enshrouded in celestial light, while his aura blazed; he was incredibly powerful.

Although Ling Feizhou was apprehensive, he had no choice but to face the attack head-on. At the same time, he was praying in his heart that the elite who had secretly interfered would continue to help.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Sure enough, although that Eighth Heaven Celestial King was fierce in his attacks, the attacks that he delivered were all easily dispersed by Ling Feizhou. In fact, he even had the upper hand in the situation, and gained a slight advantage.

Too strong; he was indeed too strong.

The other three Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings were all stunned. How could a Sixth Heaven Celestial King be so powerful? That person’s bloodline was already so powerful, so just how freakish was he himself?

The more Ling Feizhou fought, the more relaxed he became. He knew that there was definitely an elite secretly helping him, which greatly increased his confidence.

Peng!

After a long battle, he delivered a palm strike onto the face of that Eighth Heaven Celestial King, causing his nose to bleed profusely. He was in an extremely miserable state.

“Let’s go!” The Eighth Heaven Celestial King didn’t dare to continue fighting. The strength of Ling Feizhou was unexpectedly immense, making him feel like he had miscalculated.

To flatten the Western Desert Mountains, it was necessary to seek the help of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

He would quit while he was ahead. After all, he had no idea what this elite was thinking.

After confirming that the four Celestial Kings were already far away, Ling Feizhou bowed to the surroundings, and said, “Thank you for your help, Senior. Please allow me to thank you in person.”

“Come here,” Ling Han said. This time, he spoke directly so that the other would not be unable to find the direction of his location.

Ling Feizhou hurriedly descended. Ling Gaoyuan faltered for a moment, and then followed suit. Only now did he know that it was not his father that was as fierce as a tiger, but rather that he had the help of an elite.

“Se—” Ling Feizhou looked at the young man standing in front of him, and couldn’t say the word “senior” after that.

A Fifth Heaven Celestial King?

This was the elite who had been secretly interfering?

That couldn’t be, right? How could a Fifth Heaven Celestial King defeat an Eighth Heaven Celestial King? Moreover, he hadn’t even shown his face, so how powerful was he?

“Senior Han!” When Ling Gaoyuan saw him, he, too, exclaimed in shock.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “What is it? I don’t look like a senior elite in your eyes?”

“This…” Ling Feizhou paused. He very much wanted to believe that Ling Han was that senior elite, but his cultivation level of Fifth Heaven was really too low. He smiled. “Friend Han, please quit joking around. It would be better to introduce that senior.”

Ling Han asked calmly, “Where are those elders of yours? Where did Ling Jianxue, Ling Xi, and the others go?”

He dispersed the five ribbons of iridescent light around him, and his aura suddenly soared to such an inconceivable height that Ling Feizhou and his son could only look up at it.

They were both stunned. This person was actually not a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, but rather an unfathomable super elite.

F***, he could even disguise himself as a Celestial King. Just what kind of elite was he?

Heavenly Venerate; he had to be a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Feizhou instantly became even more respectful, and said, “Milord, you have misunderstood. This junior actually has no relation with that legendary person. It was just that my surname is coincidentally also Ling.”

Ling Han frowned. Was he deliberately trying to hide it, or was there really a mistake?

“Milord, you probably think that I am Ling Han’s descendant.” Ling Feizhou smiled bitterly. “Those people previously were the same as well, thinking that I’m a relative to the legendary demon king, sharing the same bloodline, but in truth, my surname really just happened to be Ling.”

Ling Han moved, and instantly grabbed Ling Feizhou. With a swipe of his finger, he cut open the other’s palm, and blood was gushing out.

Celestial King Tier blood contained a terrifying amount of energy, instantly causing even the air to boil.

Ling Han revealed an expression of disappointment, because this blood did not resonate with him at all.

This was not his bloodline; he had absolutely no relation to him at all.

It really was… a coincidence! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Han withdrew his hand. His heart suddenly felt really heavy.

This clan only had the surname of Ling, and they were already being treated like this. Then, just how bad would the situation be for Ling Jianxue and Ling Xi?

“Tell me everything you know about Ling Han’s descendants,” he said.

“Yes, milord.” Ling Feizhou didn’t dare to hide anything. He didn’t suspect that the person in front of him was the legendary demon king. After all, Ling Han also had many Heavenly Venerable-Tier friends in the past, and a few of them were even more impressive. It was said that they stood at an incredibly shocking height in that Tier.

However, Ling Feizhou’s knowledge was limited. After all, he wasn’t a Heavenly Venerate.

Ever since Ling Han had left the Realm Battlefield, the Ling Clan had been suppressed. It was said that there were mighty figures protecting them with their full efforts, so no great chaos happened. However, from then onwards, the Ling Clan became extremely low-key.

However, after the death of seven Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates of the Genesis World of the last era, this matter had become a big deal.

As for what exactly happened, Ling Feizhou did not know. He only knew that the Ling Clan had suffered a huge blow, and even he, an unrelated character with the surname of Ling, was implicated. Occasionally, there would be Celestial Kings charging over, and causing him to continuously be in hiding here and there. He even felt the urge to change his name.

Ling Han remained silent for a moment, erasing this portion of memories from Ling Feizhou and Ling Gaoyuan. He nevertheless left behind some Celestial-King-Tier Great Herbs, which could also be considered as compensation for the undeserved calamity that they had suffered.

“You all… just pray that Jianxue, Xi’er, and the others are all fine, or else!” A boundless killing intent flashed across Ling Han’s face. “I will make you regret this for the rest of your lives!”

Ling Han, together with the Empress and Hu Niu, left to embark on a journey to find their family members.

When the Empress found out about the situation, she was also very worried. Ling Xi was her bloodline, after all, and no matter how proud she was, it was impossible that she would not care about her daughter.

But the Ling Clan seemed to have disappeared from this world, and Ling Han couldn’t find out the whereabouts of the children no matter what.

He had to find another way to use the resonance in his blood to start a search.

This could not directly locate his descendants, but could point them towards a specific direction.

However, if they were too far away, this would still be ineffective. Thus, after roaming this dimension for over 100 years, Ling Han finally sensed something.

Together with the Empress and Hu Niu, he hurriedly searched in that direction.
