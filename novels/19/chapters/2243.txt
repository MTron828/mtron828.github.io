Chapter 2244: Killing Kuhaad

“Ah…” Kuhaad released a pained wail. Though his outer shell was hard, there was not much difference between his insides and the insides of any cultivator of the Celestial Realm. This fist pummeled in through the point of severance, and Regulation of Slaughter assaulted, instantly crushing his blood and flesh into mush, eliminating all life.

Finally, he was afraid because he could feel the incredibly powerful approach of death in this instant.

However, he naturally could not possibly beg to be spared. Who in the two Realms did not know that they would either kill or be killed when they encountered the opposing side? There was only one side that could survive.

There was no sympathy, no pity. There were only battle and slaughter.

Ling Han’s expression was dark. He thought of how terribly Liu Sanbian, Meng Feicheng and the others had died.

Even if Kuhaad had not killed them, these people would possibly have died in his hands anyway. However, as another member of the Celestial Realm, he could not tolerate his own people dying from having their brain juices sucked out.

This kind of scene streaked through his mind, causing his killing intent to blaze, and he was filled with brutality.

He was going to start a massacre! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Trash of the super low-level dimension!” Kuhaad roared in defiance. As he saw it, Ling Han’s cultivation level was pitifully low, and he definitely should not have the ability to threaten him, yet now it was possible that he would be killed by this kind of existence. He truly could not reconcile himself to that.

However, so what if he was furious or irreconcilable? In a battle of cultivators, everything would depend on strength. Only in circumstances when strength was equal on both sides would other factors like determination take effect.

Peng, peng, peng.?Ling Han struck without mercy, every blow landing on the wound that he had previously torn open, delivering a harsh blow on Kuhaad.

“Die!!” Ling Han roared in fury, focusing all his rage and power in this one punch.

Peng!

Kuhaad’s whole body had inflated; his compound eyes visibly exploded at the same time, his life completely erased.

Ling Han stretched out a hand in a grab, and stowed Kuhaad’s corpse into the Black Tower. After some thought, he stowed the corpses of Liu Sanbian and the others as well. Then, he looked towards the Origin Magic Cube.

The countless tiny cubes were channeling endlessly, with every tiny cube having a single eye that made up a gigantic eye. Because the tiny cubes were endlessly channeling, it made it seem like this huge eye was blinking.

Ling Han immediately thought of the first time his divine sense entered underground, where he was peered at by an eye. After slight recollection, he discovered that the two were one and the same.

“Small Tower, how can I retrieve this thing?” he asked.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. This is a Core of the heaven and earth, Source of all techniques!” Small Tower exclaimed with a tsk. “There is really no denying your good luck, brat. When the Heavenly Venerate reigned supreme, he had not yet obtained a single Core of the heaven and earth.

“Though this can only be considered a false Core of heaven and earth, it is still a supreme stroke of good fortune.”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Hey, hey, hey. If I cannot retrieve it, everything else is useless.”

“Just treat it like any treasure, and retrieve it directly,” Small Tower said carelessly. “Though the Origin Magic Cube is the Core of the heaven and earth, it itself does not have much power. That is why it required the protection of that great beast.”

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder that great beast was so strong that it surpassed the limits of Regulations of this world. That was because it was protecting the evolution of this world, and naturally had to possess power that was above standards.

Unfortunately, the heaven and earth had created Regulations, and once Regulations were formed, they would channel with absolute fairness, and even the heaven and earth could do nothing about that.

Unless… he could obtain this Origin Magic Cube. It would have initially disappeared after the world had developed, and created a system with the channeling of Regulations. However, this world was created from the clash of two Realms, and innumerable elites had surged in. Otherwise, if it had been the creation of a genuine world, how could it possibly have been disturbed by anyone.

Ling Han walked over.?Weng, he took a step forwards, yet the Origin Magic Cube retreated endlessly, turning into a tiny dot.

Regulations of Time? Regulations of Space?

Ling Han appeared slightly stunned. Wasn’t it said that the Origin Magic Cube was equivalent to a treasure?

“Do not be deceived by external factors, and listen to your own heart,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han nodded. Closing his eyes, he used his heart as his eyes.

Instantly, he discovered that his eyes had indeed deceived him. That was because the Origin Magic Cube was clearly still in its original location, and had not appeared in the boundless distance at all. Ling Han continued to walk over.

Then, there were multiple random thoughts in his mind, wanting to distract him. There were strong enemies charging towards him, exquisitely beautiful women trying to lure him away, and scenes of the heaven and earth crumbling like the world was ending, but Ling Han merely kept his heart focused, unmoved by any external factors.

Around 100 steps later, he finally arrived in front of the Origin Magic Cube.

He stretched out his hand, and placed his hand on the Origin Magic Cube. Immediately, a sudden change took place.

The cube abruptly enlarged, and even more tiny cubes appeared. In just that one instant, it had become larger than any star.

No, every tiny cube itself was a star. The only difference was that the stars were spherical, while this was a cube.

Ling Han had an enlightenment. All the stars had been split out from the Origin Magic Cube.

However, in the next instant, the Origin Magic Cube shrank endlessly, becoming smaller than even a cell, but it was still made up of innumerable tiny cubes.

The size could be decided by will, and could be changed endlessly.

This was the most central core of Source Power of the heaven and earth, and it could be seen as a seed. Naturally, it was pitifully tiny, but as the seed grew, it could grow into a completely new world.

As Ling Han used his heart to sense it, he released his own divine sense, which entered so that the Origin Magic Cube would recognize him as its master.

The Origin Magic Cube again turned from an extremely small size to an extremely huge size, enveloping Ling Han completely. Then, it did not change any further, and was as silent as the dead.

However, within the Origin Magic Cube, there was a world-shaking change taking place. Innumerable Regulations were surging into Ling Han’s body, but their height far surpassed Ling Han’s level, causing him an agonizing migraine.

Pa, his physical body crumbled instantly, leaving behind only blood essence and his life force flowing. Meanwhile, his divine sense had merged with the Origin Magic Cube.

Without the limitations of a physical body, his divine sense was also freed instantly, endlessly absorbing the ocean of Regulations that the Origin Magic Cube was transmitting to him.

Boom, a great turmoil-like change took place in the entire neutral zone. Everyone had been expelled—only those that had power that was even higher than Ascending Origin Tier could enter forcefully, but if this kind of existence entered, they would be targeted by the heaven and earth, and directly crushed into dust. Hence, this was an irresolvable issue.

No one disturbed Ling Han. Time passed quickly: 10 years, 100 years, and 1,000 years passed rapidly.

1,400 years later, a great change finally took place again in this neutral zone: it no longer expelled outsiders. Thus, whether it was the Foreign Realm or the Celestial Realm, they all sent a great number of Immortal Palace Tiers inside.

They wanted to find the truth behind the great change that had taken place 1,400 years ago. Of course, the Celestial Kings had also spoken of some secrets, saying that it was possible that a precious treasure of heaven and earth had come into being in the neutral zone.

Hence, these people had another mission, and that was to find this precious treasure, if it existed.

Several years later, the Origin Magic Cube had finally been found, and it was not just by a single group, either, but rather seven groups, consisting of both Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm, which led to a great battle, dragging all the forces of the two great Realms into this conflict.

Because it was still only the Immortal Palace Tier that could enter, neither side had a super power that could decide things one and for all, which led to an incredibly intense and tightly fought conflict. Neither side could overwhelm the other.

Most importantly, the Monarch Star-level powerhouses of boths sides had not been mobilized..
