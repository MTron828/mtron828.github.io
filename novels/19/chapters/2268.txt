Chapter 2269: The Tower of Three Realms recovers

Translator: Henyee Translations| Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them as he stated, “A group of Celestial Kings, truly

high and haughty, flattering yourselves!

“Who are you people that you can freely decide my fate?

I have done such a great service for the Celestial Realm, and what is the

result? It was only in exchange for a fate of becoming a lowly prisoner of the

Foreign Realm?

“Haha, this is really motivational!

“Do you people feel no shame?

The Heavy Metal Celestial King said, “You are sacrificing yourself for the

Celestial Realm. The future generations will remember your name, which will

be forever etched in history

Ling Han’s laughter became even more manic. He dispersed the Heaven

Deceiving Technique, revealing his true appearance and aura, asking calmly,

“Han Lin is only my alias. My true identity is Ling Han. You people say you will

remember my name. How will that be accomplished?

The Celestial Kings were all speechless. Who would have thought that Ling Han

would have come to Clear Heaven Pass under a false identity? Was there

anyone like that? This was battling for the Celestial Realm, which was

increidbly glorious.

But now, they felt as if Ling Han had slapped their faces. They actually said

that they would remember Ling Han’s name, but they were mistaken even

about his real name. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Damn brat, you actually dare deceive Celestial Kings. You are truly

outrageously bold! Unless you have done something that could not be exposed,

what need would there be for you to do such a thing? the Celestial King of the

Shen Clan demanded.

This was really being an endless pest, but now that a Celestial King had

spoken, that was equivalent to a golden rule. Even if it was false, it would

become true.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “You people have truly disappointed me. However,

there are still seniors like Lord Eternity defending me, making me feel that

there is indeed still a sliver of hope for the Celestial Realm, and that is still

worthy of being saved.”

“Spare the nonsense. As a mere Immortal Palace Tier, just shut your mouth

obediently! The Celestial King of the Shen Clan moved, grabbing out at Ling

Han.

A Heavenly Venerate had issued a decree, and he had naturally dismissed all

his reservations.

He knew that Ling Han had the Origin Magic Cube, but this was Clear Heaven

Pass, and not the neutral zone. The Cube would only allow him to comprehend

Regulations. Furthermore, the Heaven and Earth Origin Star was absolutely

useless against him; he was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King!

He was naturally absolutely certain that his attack would succeed.

The Eternity Celestial King wanted to move, but even more Celestial Kings

glanced coldly at him, so he had no choice but to suppress this urge. If he did

make a move, he would be ganged up on by the joined forces of more than 10

other Celestial Kings.

He was not the Imperial Void Celestial King, and was not that powerful.

Do you think that I only depend on the Origin Magic Cube? Ling Han sneered,

calling out mentally to small Tower. Boom, his aura instantly soared endlessly,

immediately breaking through to the Ascending Origin Tier, and then attaining

Celestial King Tier.

First Heaven, Second Heaven, Third Heaven. It was like there was no halt to

his strength.

“You people have no idea what my trump cards are, what a joke!” Ling Han said

coldly. At this time, his aura had spiked to Seventh Heaven, and it was enough

for him to oppose the Celestial King of the Shen Clan.

The Celestial King of the Shen Clan forcibly halted his assault. It was not

because he thought that he was no match for Ling Clan, but rather because this

kind of transformation was really too f****** unbelievable.

This was not the neutral zone, so what basis did Ling Han have for being so

strong?

However, Ling Han’s aura was still spiking. Very soon, it had surged past

Eighth Heaven, and advanced into Nine Heaven, and it was still soaring

The Black Tower had fully recovered, assisting Ling Han in this glorious battle!

Before leaving the neutral zone, Ling Han had spoken of something to Small

Tower, and the topic of their discussion was the possible options if he

encountered this kind of situation, and Ling Han’s decision was to throw

everything on the line and battle fiercely.

Small Tower was a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious tool, and though it had

not recovered completely, they had still been in the Celestial Realm for a long

time, after all It had aso stored up a great amount of energy, and it was no

issue for it to help Ling Han fight a dazzling battle.

Tt could not help Ling Han unleash Heavenly Venerable Tier battle prowess, but

Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier power and above, ie. battle prowess close to

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, was still doable.

Ling Han looked coldly at the Celestial King of the Shen Clan. “Weren’t you

jumping around very energetically? Jump around some more!”

All the Celestial Kings were astounded. At this moment, Ling Han’s strength

had overwhelmed them completely, and he was even slightly stronger than the

Imperial Void Celestial King.

Th-this brat actually had another precious treasure, and it was Heavenly

Venerable Tier!

Weng, the Black Tower appeared from Ling Han’s body. To allow Ling Han a

glorious battle, it had to show itself.

The Black Tower appeared once more after who knew how many years had

passed. It floated above Ling Han’s head, casting wave after wave of Primal

Chaos. The black body of the tower was emanating power that surpassed the

Regulations of the heaven and earth, seals covering its surface, and even

Celestial Kings could not distinguish them clearly.

The Tower of Three Realms!” a veteran Celestial King exclaimed. Eight epochs

ago, they had already become mighty figures, so they had naturally seen the

Tower of Three Realms before.

This was the precious Tool of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. When the

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had fused himself with Heavenly Dao, and

destroyed the connecting point of the two Realms, the Tower of Three Realms

had torn a hole in space, and its whereabouts were unknown after. This

precious Tool had been severely damaged in the great battle against the

Foreign Realm, and now they could still see the marks that the Foreign Realm

elites had left on its surface. However, a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious Tool

was indeed extraordinary. This aura was too overwhelming.

Oh, as it turned out, Ling Han was the many generations heir of the Karmic

Life Heavenly Venerable!

Just the thought of that caused sadness. At the time, for the sake of the

Celestial Realm, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had not hesitated to

destroy and sacrifice himself in exchange for peace that lasted as long as eight

epochs for the Celestial Realm, but now? Everyone was enjoying the benefits

brought by the sacrifice of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, yet was also

forcing his many generations disciple into dire straits.

“Hahahaha! The Eternity Celestial King laughed loudly, yet there were tears of

blood at the corners of his eyes.

Ling Han’s eyes were menacing as he stretched out a hand and grabbed the

Celestial King of the Shen Clan. “Old geezer, is it very fun to bully the weak with

your superior strength? Now, it is my turn to experience the fun!”

His time was limited. Firstly, the Black Tower could not possibly maintain this

state for him continuously, and secondly, now that the Black Tower had

appeared, it would draw those three Heavenly Venerates over not too much

later. He had to settle this quickly.

The Celestial King of the Shen Clan was about to cry. How could he have

imagined that Ling Han had another trick like this?

True, who would believe that the Origin Magic Cube was actually not Ling

Han’s strongest trump card.

The Celestial King of the Shen Clan wanted to flee, but while he might be able

to escape from the hands of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, faced with battle

prowess that was close to Heavenly Venerable Tier, fleeing was absolutely

unrealistic.

Ling Han grabbed him in a single stroke, and the Celestial King of the Shen

Clan had fallen into his grip.

“Do you regret it?” Ling Han asked, the killing intent in his eyes blazing and as

cold as ice.

“I do,” the Celestial King of the Shen Clan nodded. Discretion was the better

part of valor.

He was really about to die from regret. He was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King

Why had he rushed to become the vanguard? And now, it was great. He was

actually publicly humiliated by a mere Immortal Palace Tier.

Ling Han nodded, and then his hand suddenly clenched. Pa, the Celestial King

of the Shen Clan immediately turned into bits of blood. In the face of

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier power, he could not even last one attack.

Kuang, thunder instantly boomed loudly, a rain of blood streaking. A

boundless grief surged out. The heaven and earth was grieving for the death of

a Celestial King

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King had died just like that, completely negligible

in his death.

It could not be helped. The Celestial King of the Shen Clan was facing a

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, anda mere Seventh Heaven could only go so far.

“Just now, how many more were shouting? Step out and show me?” Ling Han

stretched open his hand, his whole body bathing in the blood of a Celestial

King. He was like a great demon king that had come from the Ancient Age.

At this moment, not one Celestial King dared to reply.

Though Ling Han was indeed very arrogant, and was only a mere Immortal

Palace Tier, who asked him to possess a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious

treasure, much less one that was capable of recovering? Even a Ninth Heaven

Celestial King would have to make a strategic retreat.

“Heavy Metal geezer, Ill deal with you first!” Ling Han moved in fury, and

grabbed out at the Heavy Metal Celestial King.

“Humph, do you think I am so easily bullied? The Heavy Metal Celestial King

sneered. His strength could be ranked in the middle echelons among all Ninth

Heaven Celestial Kings, and he was definitely not someone that the Celestial

King of the Shen Clan could compare with..
