3317 Greater Danger Lies Behind

When they saw this piece of news, the people in the plaza instantly exploded.

'What?'

An adult Gray Rock Beast? A First Extreme Beast?

What kind of joke was this? A Blood Transformation Tier cultivator had killed a First Extreme?

Looking at Ling Han's information, nineteen years old, First Change, even if this guy concealed his cultivation level, he would only be Second Change at most, because when he entered into the

academy, he was only a Meridian Opening Tier. In just a few months' time, no matter what, he would only be able to advance into Second Change.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Being able to kill an enemy even though it had surpassed him by a major tier in cultivation level meant that Ling Han's true battle prowess had even surpassed First Extreme. Otherwise, he would only have defeated his enemy and not killed it.

"There must be a mistake."

"That's right. For a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator to kill an Extreme Bone Tier, do you think that it is Hong Tianbu?"

"Er, this person really seems to have the reputation of being the second Hong Tianbu."

Everyone was in an uproar. This kind of battle merit was practically blinding. If it was not for the fact that Hong Tianliang had also been pumped full of adrenaline, and killed more than twenty Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beasts, he would probably be surpassed by Ling Han in an instant.

"Hurry up and check the recording. Just how was it killed?"
﻿
Everyone went to look for the recording, but the battle between Ling Han and theGray Rock Beast was really too fast. The surveillance devices couldn't catch sight of it at all. It was all afterimages, and they could only see that as the battle continued, the Gray Rock Beast fell to the ground.

"It seems like Ling Han fired out some kind of powerful Spirit Tool, which directly penetrated the Gray Rock Beast's forehead. Look, there's a cold light flying out of Gray Rock Beast's left ear. Although it can't be seen very clearly, it can still be captured by the surveillance."bender

"Indeed." Everyone nodded.

"Then it makes sense. If one used a Spirit Tool, a Blood Transformation Tier would indeed have a chance of killing an Extreme Bone Tier."

"Sigh, this gave me a false scare. I really thought that there would be someone so freakish."

A considerable number of people thought that the fact that Ling Han could kill a Gray Rock Beast was due to the might of the Spirit Tool. Immediately, they looked down on him, but there were still some that were stunned.

"Previously, I had only thought that this Gray Rock Beast had not matured, and was still a Blood Transformation Tier. However, now that I have confirmed that it is a First Extreme, this is terrifying."

"After battling with this Demonic Beast for so long, Ling Han actually hasn't been hit even once."

"This speed is too shocking."

"This battle lasted for a whole seventeen minutes. Even if Ling Han's blood boiled, he could not possibly have lasted that long. Furthermore, from the image, he had not used this trump card."

"A Blood Transformation Tier elite being able to burst out with twice the speed of sound, this is too shocking!"

In the hunting ground.

Hong Tianliang killed another Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beast, and its colossal body collapsed, causing even the ground to tremble slightly.

A faint smile appeared on his face, and he couldn't help but think of his older brother.

Though this person was a shadow in his heart, a demon, he had to admit that he had also given him great help.

For example, this time, with Hong Tianbu's help, he had entered an ancient site to train. Not only had he obtained a great many treasures, which greatly improved his cultivation level, he had also unlocked a new ability at the same time. His battle prowess was countless times stronger than an ordinary Second Change.

After reaching Great Accomplishment in battle prowess, he no longer saw Ling Han as a rival. However, he would still battle with Ling Han. Firstly, to wash away his humiliation, and secondly, to snatch back the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

When he had confirmed that his position of first place was unbreakable, he would seek out Ling Han.

Out of habit, he turned on the optical computer to check his score.

As a matter of course, he was first place, and his score was as high as just over 400 points. A one-of-a-kind... Hmm?

He suddenly saw the name that followed behind him-Ling Han!

Why had this guy suddenly appeared?

Hong Tianliang's vanity was still very strong. Every time he killed a Demonic Beast, he would look at the leaderboard, and the result every time was that he was continuously widening the gap between himself and the second place.

Thus, he was naturally shocked to see Ling Han appear out of nowhere.

He looked at Ling Han's battle merits again, and couldn't help but look solemn.

He had killed a First Extreme Demonic Beast?

"He has only relied on the might of a Spirit Tool!" he said coldly, his eyes looking ahead. "Fine, I'll charge to the third area, defeat this person, and take back the Essence Nurturing Gourd."

He began to advance towards the third area. Of course, he would also kill Demonic Beasts along the way, and continue to increase his own marks.

"Yi, this brat actually killed a Demonic Beast of Extreme Bone Tier!" Chen Shengjie exclaimed in shock.

"He only succeeded with the help of a Spirit Tool, there's no need to take it to heart," Chen Jingye immediately said.

It was destined that the four of them would not be able to snatch the throne, but the relationship between brothers was actually better because of that, because there was no need for them to scheme against each other.

"Hurry up, we're already not far from the third area."

The four of them strode forwards. After passing through the canyon, they arrived at the place where Ling Han and the Gray Rock Beast were battling fiercely. There were still traces of a great battle left here, as well as the Gray Rock Beast's corpse that was still dripping with blood.🄽🄾🅅🄴🄻🄷🅄🄻🄺.🄲🄾🄼

"Ninety seven, what are you doing?" Chen Deyang asked.

Chen Lixing was flipping through the Gray Rock Beast, and he soon released a furious roar, "This b@stard, he took away the Gray Rock Beast's c*ck."

"This is very nutritious for men. It is said that it can make your c*ck as hard as a rock, and specialize in treating all kinds of..." Chen Deyang faltered, "Yi, 97th, why are you in such a rush? Could it be that you are not skilled in that area?"

"Get lost! You're the one who can't! Your whole family can't!" Chen Lixing flew into a humiliated rage.

Chen Jingye couldn't bear listening to this any longer, and he said, "Don't forget, we're all a family!"

If even this whole family couldn't do it, then who had been the one to beget them?

"Let's go. Hurry up and give chase. That brat should not be too far away," Chen Shengjie said.

The four of them sped up, chasing after the traces that Ling Han had left behind. On the other side, they still had Gu Xiangming keeping an eye on Ling Han from outside, responsible for guiding them in the right direction.

It wasn't long before they surrounded Ling Han and blocked him outside a dense forest.

"Heng, heng, heng!" The four of them all sneered.

Ling Han kept looking for the next prey, but there were too few Extreme Bone Tier beasts. After circling around for a while, he still didn't see anything. 

Who would've thought that he would see Chen Shengjie and Chen Lixing right in front of him when he just came out of the forest?

And behind him, Chen Deyang and Chen Jingye also slowly walked out.

All of a sudden, he had fallen under the siege of the four of them. However, he was naturally unafraid.
﻿
He raised his head to take a look. There were surveillance monitors on the great tree to his left.

"There's no need to look. We've already had someone turn off this surveillance device," Chen Jingye said calmly. "So, don't expect anyone to come and save you!"

It was turned off?

He was an Imperial Prince, after all, so he really had a lot of power.

Ling Han nodded internally. That was good. Otherwise, he would have reservations when he attacked. Now, however, he could beat him to his heart's content.

"Hand over the optical computer first!" Chen Deyang immediately shouted. As long as the recording didn't disappear, he wouldn't be able to rest easy.

"Kneel!" Chen Lixing shouted.

Ling Han couldn't help but laugh in spite of himself, and said, "You guys each say one thing, what exactly do you want from me?"

Chen Jingye and the others exchanged looks, feeling that Ling Han's calmness and composure was a bit over the top.

"Don't waste your breath on him. Capture him first, then give him a good beating, and teach him how to behave," Chen Shengjie said impatiently.

"All right!" The other three nodded.
