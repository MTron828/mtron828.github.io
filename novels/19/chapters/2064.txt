Chapter 2065: Battle of Monarch Tiers

Not to interfere with each other.

This was extremely simple. Zhu Huiyun and Tian Qingyue would continue to battle against Ling Han, while Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing would continue to keep an eye on Ji Wuming. Meanwhile, they would naturally keep their own share of spoils. Neither of them would target the other.

“Agreed!” the four monarch tiers said with a nod.

A baleful smile spread across Ji Wuming’s face. He had slain many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the past, so what were these mere Heaven Soul cultivators to him? Even though Tian Qingyue and the others were all regarded as paramount monarch tiers, their talent was only so-so in Ji Wuming’s eyes.

After all, which of them could become a Fifth Heaven Celestial King?

Even if they could become an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, this still wasn’t enough for Ji Wuming to take them seriously.

To challenge his will? Die!

“Initially, I didn’t want to argue with you trash. However, you people insist on seeking death?” Ji Wuming said in a baleful voice. Killing intent exuded from his eyes.

“You’re truly as arrogant as can be!” Yu Huaqing said in an icy voice.

“Enough with the nonsense. Die!” Xia Houtong was filled with impatience. In his eyes, a measly Earth Soul cultivator could be killed with a wave of his hand. If it weren’t for the fact that Ji Wuming was so good at fleeing, how could he have survived until now?

However, did being good at fleeing represent that he was good at fighting?

Naturally not.

The two of them immediately lashed out, with their attacks being as vicious as could be. They wanted to kill Ji Wuming with a single blow.

This wasn’t because they respected Ji Wuming’s strength, but it was because they were afraid that he would move first. Thus, they needed to strike first and strike hard. They were going to snatch Ji Wuming’s spatial storage tool. After all, they would only trust themselves to go through his spatial storage tool.

“Fools!” Ji Wuming said with a sneer. His body suddenly moved like a flash of light as he charged toward Xia Houtong.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A violent battle immediately erupted. Ji Wuming was truly ferocious, and he was taking the initiative to attack even though he was fighting against two opponents. As he channeled his celestial techniques, his battle prowess was as overwhelming as the heavens. Even though he was at a numerical disadvantage, he wasn’t being suppressed at all.

This naturally astounded Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing. Just like how Tian Qingyue had been stunned by Ling Han just then, the two of them hadn’t imagined that a Yang Soul cultivator could possibly be so powerful. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, they immediately composed themselves after a few exchanges.

Ji Wuming was indeed powerful. However, he was still limited by his cultivation level. In fact, he was only so powerful because of his intricate grasp of Regulations. Because of this, he could unleash greater power from celestial techniques. Meanwhile, the celestial techniques of his opponents would become noticeably weaker.

With his attacks strengthened and the attacks of his opponents weakened, he could surprisingly overcome a disadvantage of three minor levels.

No… In fact, the combination of Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing was still slightly more powerful. However, they definitely couldn’t suppress and capture Ji Wuming in a short amount of time. Thus, this became an intense battle that wouldn’t conclude any time soon.

On the other side, Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun were battling against Ling Han.

They also couldn’t gain a noticeable upper hand, and this was because Ling Han’s Great Clash of Source Powers could specifically cause great damage and destruction to a certain area. Regardless of how many opponents he faced, anyone who entered the range of this attack would be struck. Thus, as long as Ling Han didn’t become exhausted, he could exert a similar amount of pressure on both Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun.

Both battles were remarkably intense and vicious. In fact, just a single shock wave from these battles could easily annihilate an ordinary Heaven Soul cultivator.

The spectating followers were deeply shocked by what they saw. Meanwhile, Yu Huaqing and Xia Houtong naturally had their own subordinates as well. However, they had arrived slightly later. Even so, they were still completely stunned by the scenes that welcomed them.

The four most powerful youths of the Universal Peace Heaven… were actually teaming up to battle against two people!

Heavens! Who could believe this?

“Ling Han, let’s team up as well!” Ji Wuming suddenly said.

He was not one to make meaningless remarks. As he finished speaking, he had already launched a palm strike that transformed into two black swords that slashed at Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun.

Ling Han initially thought that he was hearing things. However, upon seeing Ji Wuming’s attack, he naturally wouldn’t doubt his own eyes as well.

Ji Wuming genuinely wanted to team up with him!

Ling Han was astonished, yet this didn’t affect his reaction. He also launched two punches, activating his Great Clash of Source Powers, and unleashing a devastating attack at Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun. When Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing arrived before him, he actively charged forward to block their attacks with his body.

Peng, peng!

The attacks of the two monarch tiers struck Ling Han in unison. However, Ling Han was merely sent flying back, and he didn’t even spit a single drop of blood.

Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing’s eyes widened in shock. Their attacks had struck Ling Han head-on, yet he hadn’t even spit a single drop of blood?

This was unbelievable!

However, they were monarch tiers, after all, so they quickly regained their composure. They continued to charge at Ji Wuming. Just then, they had already agreed not to interfere with each other’s battles. They couldn’t steal each other’s prey.

It was pretty much the same with Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun, who continued to target Ling Han.

However, because of this, Ling Han and Ji Wuming now had a significant advantage. They each had two people who wouldn’t attack them. Meanwhile, because they had teamed up, they could essentially battle against their opponents two-on-two. This allowed them to largely eliminate their disadvantage.

“Let’s stop restricting ourselves!” Zhu Huiyun roared. Even though she was a woman, she was even more resolute than most men. “Let’s work together to kill these two people!”

Even though it was four against two right now, each pair of them was only focusing on their own opponent. Thus, they weren’t exactly working together.

“Agreed!” Tian Qingyue and the others said with a nod. Monarch tiers were naturally resolute people.

Upon teaming up, their battle prowess instantly surged by a significant amount.

“I’ll take care of defending. You focus on attacking!” Ling Han roared.

“Alright!” Ji Wuming immediately replied with a decisive nod.

Ling Han summoned his divided soul, and stopped unleashing his Great Clash of Source Powers. Instead, he started to act as a human shield, blocking all of his opponents’ attacks.

Of course, it was naturally impossible to block all of their attacks, but he could still block a large portion of them. With Ji Wuming’s strength, he could naturally deal with the attacks that slipped through. With the pressure eased, he could more so draw on his full power to unleash powerful attacks.

Just how terrifying was Ji Wuming if he didn’t need to focus on his defenses?

This was simply indescribable!

His battle experience was far superior to that of Tian Qingyue and the others. In fact, he was more than 100,000,000 times more experienced. His attacks flowed like water, and there were no crevices that they couldn’t enter. His ability to seize opportunities and create opportunities was more so something that Tian Qingyue and the others couldn’t hope to compare to. Without needing to worry about his defenses, it was as if Ji Wuming had become the sharpest blade in the world.

Tian Qingyue and the others roared in fury as they felt a devastating pressure sweep over them.

“Kill him first!” they shouted as they glared at Ji Wuming.

However, it was a shame that Ling Han was there to block their attacks. Relying on the Regulations of Time and the Regulations of Space, he continued to use himself as a human shield, blocking almost all of their attacks. Tian Qingyue and the others were completely unable to touch Ji Wuming.

“Hahahaha!” Ji Wuming roared with laughter, and his attacks became increasingly smooth and vicious.

He was truly a strange person. After teaming up with Ling Han, it was clear that he had placed all of his trust in Ling Han, completely ignoring all of the incoming attacks. He focused his full effort on unleashing powerful attacks.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel slightly surprised. However, he also felt extremely thrilled at this moment. Fighting alongside such a partner was truly an amazing feeling.
