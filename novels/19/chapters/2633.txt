Chapter 2634: Giving no face Translator: Henyee Translations  Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng! A figure shot out of the ground, standing proudly in midair. A blood-red aura was bubbling from all over his body, as if he was a great demonic god that was about to begin a massacre, and kill every single being in this world.

It was Pei Shenghai.

Ling Han seemed slightly surprised. With a blow from him, a peak-stage Seventh Heaven King Tier—even if he was a monarch tier—actually hadn’t been killed?

“I have really underestimated you!” Pei Shenghai’s voice rumbled out like thunder. Cold light shot from his eyes. Seals of great dao were visibly flickering. His killing intent blazed as his fury reached extreme levels.

“That’s what I thought. How could Pei Shenghai possibly be insta-killed!” When the people in the area saw this, they all nodded. This was the kind of supreme monarch tier that they had imagined.

“Pei Shenghai must have been underestimating his opponent too much.”

“His strength is definitely not as low as this.”

Meanwhile, Ling Han stared at Pei Shenghai for a while, and gave an “oh.” He said, “The body defense technique you cultivate is indeed extraordinary, allowing you to escape this calamity.”

When one had reached a height that Ling Han had, he naturally knew very well how much force he needed to use in his attacks. He would definitely not waste the slightest excess bit, but he had not expected that Pei Shenghai would have cultivated a very strong body defense technique, and that was why he had not succeeded fully.

Pu! As if in response, Pei Shenghai immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. He had luckily escaped death, but it did not mean that he did not need to sacrifice anything for it.

Seeing this scene, the people in the area were instantly extremely shocked.

Correct. Ling Han had not killed Pei Shenghai with a single blow, but a single blow was enough to make the other party throw up blood. Was this not enough to express how strong he was?

“Heavens, his battle prowess would have to be at the Eighth Heaven at least, right?”

“Even if it is the early stage of the Eighth Heaven, he has breached the gap of three cultivation levels!”

“A Fifth Heaven… yet he possesses the battle prowess of the Eighth Heaven, I’m about to go crazy!”

Everyone was grabbing their head as they exclaimed in shock. They could not believe this. They knew that there were indeed freaks in this world, but this was really too freakish, freakish to a point that they could not accept.

Pei Shenghai threw up blood like mad, but his vitality was actually soaring. His eyes shone with divine light, his fighting spirit blazing as he pointed a finger at Ling Han. “You have successfully angered me, and death is the only path for you now.”

Ling Han laughed. “Have you come to amuse me?”

“Die!” Pei Shenghai charged out. This time, he was no longer careless, a silver spear appearing in his hands. Shua! His speed was astonishing, and in a flash of silvery light, he instantly rushed right in front of Ling Han in the next moment.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In this blow, Pei Shenghai had brought with him the great power of the heaven and earth. It was as if the heaven and earth were working together to suppress Ling Han.

Monarch tiers were monarch tiers after all, so how could his strength be underestimated?

And just when the silver spear was about to pierce its target, a spiritual attack was sent out towards Ling Han as well.

Weng!

Ling Han suddenly felt pain in his mind, as if his head was about to explode.

“Death Spear!” Pei Shenghai roared out, pouring all his power into the spear, and stabbing out at Ling Han.

Under the spiritual attack, even if Ling Han’s mind did not explode, he would definitely still be affected, which would cause his reaction speed to slow down. And in a battle of this level, a slight delay of one’s reaction would become fatal.

‘Die.’

Pei Shenghai smirked coldly. His eyes were weeping tears of blood, and his expression was extremely twisted.

But in the next instant, the smile on his face suddenly turned into shock.

That was because Ling Han moved calmly, and easily grabbed this spear.

It really was just a short distance away, and the tip of the spear halted at Ling Han’s throat.

Pei Shenghai pushed forwards with all his might, but the spear seemed like it was rooted, and was completely motionless.

“How could this be? You clearly have not released any spiritual attack, so how could you not be affected!” Pei Shenghai exclaimed in shock. Indeed, he could not believe this.

Spiritual attacks could cancel each other out, but Ling Han had clearly not sent out any spiritual attack, so how could he be completely unaffected?

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Who said I was not affected?” He had still been pained, but now that his tolerance had greatly increased, and with his incredibly strong willpower, he only experienced pain for a short while. His battle prowess would not be reduced because of this.

This was called being affected?

Pei Shenghai was speechless, but when he saw that Ling Han’s other hand had already balled into a fist that was about to fly towards him, his heart turned cold. He hurriedly loosened his grip, and xiu, he did his best to retreat as much as possible while exerting force through his feet.

This opponent was too frightening, absolutely not someone Pei Shenghai could stand against.

“Now that you have attacked me, you still wish to retreat completely unscathed?” Ling Han shook his head, his steps light. He seemed completely unhurried, but he was sticking closely to Pei Shenghai’s tail. He had just not thrown a punch yet.

Pei Shenghai’s face had turned completely pale. What kind of monster was this? His power, speed, and spirit had all surpassed the level of Fifth Heaven, and even overwhelmed him completely.

Yet Ling Han did not move all this while, and Pei Shenghai finally relaxed.

‘He… should be holding reservations because of Lord He Yi, right?

‘True, what kind of being is He Yi? A peak-stage Seventh Heaven supreme monarch star whose Evolution Index has even soared to 12. Who would not be afraid of this kind of character? Lord He Yi only needs to take one more step, and he will be able to do as he likes in the Celestial King Graveyard. If he becomes a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he will definitely become an absolutely invincible existence.’

“Looks like you know what’s good for you. Lord He Yi—”

Pu!

Pei Shenghai was just about to say a few words to keep up appearances, yet had not anticipated that Ling Han would suddenly deliver a punch, crushing his head directly. His mind was instantly destroyed, so it was natural that he was completely dead.

A series of sharp inhaling rang out in the area. This guy was really decisive and resolute. Pei Shenghai had already revealed his backer, but Ling Han had still moved without hesitation, not giving face to even He Yi.

“He Yi… is an absolutely extraordinary character!”

“This guy is indeed extraordinary, but a Fifth Heaven actually wants to match a peak-stage Seventh Heaven supreme monarch star? No matter what, that cannot be possible!”

“That’s right. Even if this guy’s Evolution Index has reached 12, there is no way to compensate for the gap of two cultivation levels.”

“He’ll just be waiting for Lord He Yi’s fury to tear him into pieces.”

Everyone was not optimistic about Ling Han, and shook their head. Even those peak-stage Seventh Heaven elites did not step out and say anything. In any case, once He Yi was here, Ling Han would simply become a dead body.

But how could they have known that not only had Ling Han’s Evolution Index reached 12, he had also obtained an invincible Body Art? This was the true basis for his confidence.

Ling Han returned to his original spot and sat down, waiting patiently for the celestial fruit to ripen.

He was determined to obtain this celestial fruit. He only needed one-fifth, or even one-tenth, and he would have the confidence to attempt breaking through to the Sixth Heaven, and after he crossed this threshold, it would be no issue for him to match a Ninth Heaven Celestial King when he channeled both his Body Art and power of Regulation at the same time.

He should only need five years, at most, or so he secretly estimated.

Even Pei Shenghai had practically been insta-killed, so it was naturally impossible that there would be anyone else that would go and provoke Ling Han again or covet the Empress. Even if they did, they could only keep their thoughts to themselves.

Time passed quietly, and Gu Heyi did not appear. It seemed like he would not appear before the celestial fruit ripened.

Ling Han was unconcerned as well. At present, his only priority was the celestial fruit. He only had to ascend to the Sixth Heaven, and no matter who his opponent was, he would be able to suppress them.

And in this manner, four years passed.

On this day, the fragrance emanating from the celestial fruit became extremely strong, causing everyone’s pores to expand and dilate, and making them feel as if they were floating on air.

A supremely valuable celestial fruit, a supreme Great Herb!

“Hahaha!” Following a loud laugh, a figure in green streaked forwards from the distance. At first, he was still a boundless distance away, but in the blink of an eye, he instantly appeared at the side of the lake.

Everyone was filled with reverence because this old man in green was enshrouded in eight ribbons of iridescent light.

The celestial fruit was close to ripening, and the powerful figures had finally appeared.
