3040 Everyone Is Here, Let’s Fight

‘As expected!’ the two ultimate elites, Chong Yan and Big Dipper, thought to themselves. Ling Han had actually come here as well.

This brat was truly audacious. Was he trying to provoke five ultimate elites in one go?

“You two old thieves, go to the side and cool off first!” Ling Han suddenly turned his head and threw a punch. Hong, the Void was smashed open by him, and Chong Yan and Big Dipper coincidentally rushed over as Ling Han took advantage of the situation to send them into the Void.

Without waiting for the two ultimate elites to rush out, Ling Han unleashed a full-power attack, forcing the two of them backwards.

He casually sealed the spatial rift. This should be enough to trap the two ultimate elites for more than 10 breaths of time.

Xiu! Ling Han’s figure leaped again. After a few steps, he stepped downwards…

Half Moon’s place of enlightenment.

Heavenly Venerate Half Moon was not standing guard over the place of enlightenment. With his status, it was already a great kindness for him to occasionally reveal himself and guide the Celestial Kings in their cultivation.

Ling Han was filled with destructive power. When his figure descended, it carried with it an incomparably powerful impact. When he landed on the place of enlightenment, a bang instantly reverberated in all directions with him as the focus.

Peng, peng, peng! The entire place of enlightenment was instantly reduced to ruins. The Celestial Kings inside were all sent flying like scarecrows.

Not only were they completely defenseless, but their faces were also filled with confusion. ‘What happened?’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and stretched out his right hand. When he retracted it, a door plaque immediately appeared in his hand.

Yes, he also obtained the signboard of Half Moon’s place of enlightenment.

“Old thief Half Moon, hurry up and come out to pay your respects to your grandfather!” Ling Han laughed loudly.

Hong! A terrifying aura rushed out, and Heavenly Venerate Half Moon appeared. He walked over from afar, and he stepped into the sky and suppressed the earth with a single step, dominating the world.

“Brat, you actually dare to offend me? Are you tired of living?” Heavenly Venerate Half Moon said coldly.

Ling Han waved the signboard in his hand, and said, “Your dignity has fallen into my hands. If you want it back, come and chase me!”

Heavenly Venerate Half Moon was just about to speak when he faltered. He sensed two extremely powerful auras approaching.

These auras were no weaker than him.

‘Seventh Tier!’

He looked over and saw that Chong Yan and Big Dipper, the two ultimate elites, had already rushed over from afar.

“You guys?” he muttered.

“Suppress this brat first!” Chong Yan said in a deep voice.

“All right!”

The three ultimate elites charged at Ling Han at the same time, each of them filled with rage.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Come and chase me. If you do, I’ll acknowledge you as my godsons.”

He turned around and ran at an astonishing speed.

This infuriated the three ultimate elites. Which one of their rivals wasn’t the most powerful person in the world? They all prided themselves on their status. They had truly never encountered someone like Ling Han who still spouted insults and slurs.

However, they just couldn’t catch up to Ling Han and take down this brat, blasting him into pieces.

Nevertheless, he had already taken down their signboards. How could they tolerate it?

Chase!

They were chasing after Ling Han. This brat was probably going to where Mysterious Feather or Shatter Mountains was.

After chasing for a while, they were certain that his target was Mysterious Feather.

More than a dozen days passed again, and Ling Han was already close to the place of enlightenment of Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather.

As for the three ultimate elites… Ling Han shook his head. He couldn’t possibly banish Chong Yan and the others into the Void at the same time.

‘Forget it, I’ll end this quickly.’

Xiu! Ling Han landed with a single step, like a meteor falling to the ground.

He crashed into the ground, causing the ground to shake violently and ripple like a carpet. The area of the place of enlightenment in front of him instantly collapsed, and Celestial Kings flew out shakily.

Coincidentally, Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather was actually in the place of enlightenment. With a cold humph, a large hand instantly slapped out at Ling Han.

Ling Han sighed, and clashed head-on with the other party.

Boom! Terrifying power surged, and the building fragments flying in the sky instantly exploded into dust.

‘Sigh, the signboard was also destroyed.’

Ling Han shook his head. It was a bit of a pity. He had originally wanted to gather the signboards of the five ultimate elites’ place of enlightenment, and hang them outside a latrine in the future. Thinking about it, that would be quite eye-catching. Perhaps even Celestial Kings would specially come over to pay their respects.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Chong Yan, Big Dipper, and Half Moon, the three ultimate elites, had already caught up. Now, there were four Seventh Tiers here. This lineup was shockingly terrifying.

“Come, come, come. All of you come and chase after me, grandsons.” Ling Han laughed loudly, and turned to run.

“Don’t even think about leaving!” Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather attacked, wanting to detain Ling Han.

Unfortunately, this could only be a beautiful fantasy.

Ling Han moved swiftly, while the four ultimate elites chased after him relentlessly.

“This kid must be going to where Shatter Mountains is.”

“He really ate the guts of a Heavenly Venerate, actually wanting to provoke the five of us in one go[1].”

“This time, even if he has Seventh-Tier defense, we will still exhaust his strength bit by bit and suppress him till his death!”

The four ultimate elites all became ruthless. No one had ever dared to humiliate them like this before. If they could not rip Ling Han’s corpse into 10,000 pieces, they would not be able to live in the future.

The five people with the strongest battle prowess in the world were shuttling back and forth. Ling Han passed through Chong Yan’s, Big Dipper’s, Half Moon’s, and Mysterious Feather’s four places of enlightenment before returning to Shatter Mountains. However, the five ultimate elites’ places of enlightenment were not located in a straight line.

Thus, Ling Han didn’t need the total amount of time he had taken on his previous journeys to charge his way back to Shatter Mountains. In just 20 days, he had already neared where Shatter Mountains was.

“Old bastard, I’m back again. Hurry up and come out to receive me!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and punched out, smashing into the ground.

Instantly, heaven and earth collapsed.

“Brat!” Shatter Mountains flew out and stood in the sky. “You actually dare to come back?”

‘I thought you said you were leaving. Why are you back?’

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “After thinking about it, bullying you is still the most interesting, so I quickly came back to see you.”

“Damn it!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains roared furiously. Just as he was about to attack, he saw four figures flying over. Because their speed was too fast, under the intense friction, their bodies were all burning with flames.

Chong Yan, Big Dipper, Half Moon, and Mysterious Feather.

Gasp!

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains immediately came to a realization. Ling Han had probably gone to visit all four of his old friends these past few days, infuriating them all.

The five ultimate elites stood still and spread out, surrounding Ling Han.

“Brat, I will definitely suppress you today!” Heavenly Venerate Half Moon said coldly. If the five of them joined forces, they would definitely be able to suppress any single Seventh Tier.

“I don’t want to fool around with people who only know how to brag.” Ling Han tore open the Void, and stepped into it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After chasing Ling Han for so many days, how could Chong Yan and the others allow him to escape just like that?

They all chased into the Void, wanting to follow Ling Han closely. No matter where Ling Han went, they would follow him, determined to crush Ling Han.

However, to their surprise, Ling Han actually didn’t leave after entering the Void. Instead, he stood there proudly.

“Five old bastards, let’s settle this properly!” Ling Han cracked his knuckles, killing intent surging.

Now that the five old thieves had finally gathered together, they could have some fun.
