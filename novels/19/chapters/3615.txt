Chapter 3616: Difficult to Advance an Inch

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han trusted his own judgement. This was a test of mind and willpower. If one wasn’t firm enough, they could only look at the “Palace” and sigh in helplessness.

He exploited some of the fruits of the little loli’s labour, and began to eat ravenously, his feet not stopping in the slightest.

Tang Yun’er was naturally enraged by this, and she almost charged over to fight him to the death.

Thankfully, the little loli was still reasonable.

However, she thought that Ling Han’s actions were only futile. Since he had only been going around in circles, how could he possibly break through the formation?

“Sigh, I met an idiot!” She shrugged. As she licked her candy, she watched Ling Han’s performance.

Ling Han did not take it to heart. He only persisted in his initial judgement, and followed his own heart.

A day passed very quickly. Though the sun could not be seen here, with the existence of the optical computer, they naturally knew when the sun would rise.

Ling Han even stopped cultivating. He was determined to get through this place.

Ling Han, you’re the number one idiot in the world.” The little loli didn’t admire Ling Han’s tenacity at all. Instead, she made sarcastic remarks.

Ling Han merely chuckled. After walking for an entire day, his body was also a little tired, but he showed no signs of stopping.

In the blink of an eye, another day had passed.

The little girl was extremely displeased. Why did she have to be responsible for cooking for herself and Ling Han?

I’m still a baby, all right?

However, Ling Han had completely become a slacker. What could she do? She couldn’t starve to death, right?

“Damn Lmg Han, damn Ling Han, I’m going to make a paper effigy of you and stab you every day,” Tang Yun’er muttered?.

Three days, four days!

After travelling for four consecutive days without any sleep or rest, even if Ling Han’s physique was tough, he still felt weary, and had an urge to fall asleep. But if he collapsed now, wouldn’t all his previous efforts be in vain?

“Ling Han, you are really one-track-minded. Could it be that you have not considered the fact that this kind of action is completely futile? Then the time you waste would only increase further and further!” The little loli could not bear it.

It was too boring. There was nothing to do here, and she was already about to throw up from looking at the same scenery all the time.

If it wasn’t for the fact that she couldn’t withstand the water pressure, she would have long since gone ashore by herself.

Six days, seven days, eight days. Even if he wasn’t fighting, and was merely running, Ling Han was still as tired as a dog. His breathing was like a bellows, and all the clothes on his body had long since been drenched in sweat. His hair was also dripping wet and stuck together.

The soles of his shoes had long since been torn, and there were also many blisters on the soles of his feet. There was even blood, and it could be said that he looked extremely miserable.

Even so, Ling Han’s eyes were still bright, and his willpower was firm.

In truth, his body had already reached its limits, and now, he was completely relying on willpower to hold on.

Lmg Han gritted his teeth, and his feet stepped out due to inertia. He could no longer feel anything.

Actually, Ling Han also knew that this could possibly be a wasted effort, but after running for three days, he used this as a kind of training.

This was a test of willpower. Without the pressure of life and death, how far could he last?

He was sure that after this tempering, his willpower would become much stronger. Furthermore, stimulating all the power in his body would also be greatly beneficial to his cultivation.

He had been climbing to the limit all this while, and wasn’t this also a kind of limit?

Running like this consumed less stamina and mystical power, but after running for nine days, Ling Han’s stamina and mystical power were completely exhausted. If an enemy really came now, they could easily kill him.

Unfortunately, who could go down to the bottom of the lake like this?

If he really descended, then it would probably have to be a supreme elite like Venerate Tier or even a super mighty being like a Saint in fact. Then, even if Ling Han was in his prime condition, he would not be able to match a single glance from the Saint.

He was relaxed and threw all his cares away, exhausting himself completely. Without physical power, without mystical power, and even Spiritual Power was completely exhausted, Ling Han was really moving with a tenacious willpower now. He no longer had any way to stimulate movement techniques, and could only rely on his two legs to move mechanically.

In the beginning, the little girl was still laughing at him, but afterwards, she kept her mouth shut.

Even if she thought that Ling Han was wasting his life, seeing his tenacious willpower, she could only feel admiration.

This kind of person was deserving of respect.

“Goodness, though this guy is not some Divine Physique or Celestial Seed, this willpower is really too terrifying,” the little loli thought. “How did he manage to cultivate such a powerful battle prowess, and added with this willpower, it would be difficult not to become a great elite.”

Ling Han’s steps became slower and slower. His willpower was indeed tough, but he was still a body of flesh and blood, after all. He would still be restricted by his body. While the limits were indeed to be broken, there was still an end to it.

He was going to reach the end now. Step by step, he was as slow as a tortoise crawling.

However, right at this moment, Tang Yun’er’s mouth suddenly gaped open. She was incredibly surprised to see that Ling Han was approaching the palace step by step!

‘F*ck! Is this really possible?’

Previously, whether Ling Han was running or walking, he was still standing where he was, but now, he was actually approaching the palace.

He had really done it!

The owner of this palace must also be a simple-minded idiot,” the little loli said with absolute certainty.

Ling Han, on the other hand, didn’t feel anything at all. His mind was completely blank, and there was only one thought in his mind, and that was to g°> go, go.

The plaza was very big, but it was only about three hundred meters or so. Ling Han’s speed was very slow. Every step he took was like a tortoise, but in the end, he was still endlessly approaching.

After about half an hour, Ling Han arrived at the entrance of the palace. At this time, there was really no further to go. Ling Han suddenly came to his senses. As it turned out, he had already walked over.

He relaxed internally, and instantly fell forwards. Hu, he released a snore, and instantly fell asleep.

Just as he collapsed, with a creak, the doors of the palace automatically opened. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Lmg Han! Lmg Han!” The little loli called out from afar. She had no way to get there, and she had no interest in running for ten days to meet up with Ling Han. After so long, this guy would have already gotten up.

-She did not believe that Ling Han would die. This guy’vitality was like a tenacious cockroach.

After sleeping for a day and a night, Ling Han finally woke up.

‘Ow, ow, ow!’

He couldn’t help but grit his teeth in pain. It was as if his whole body was falling apart. The pain was indescribable.

However, his vitality was extraordinarily vigorous, and was at least much stronger than before.

He took out some medicine and treated himself. Then, he turned to look at the little loli behind him, and shouted, “You wait there, I’ll go in and take a look.” “Even if you don’t tell me, I don’t plan to go in either.” The little loli licked the toffee, looking very proud.

p***

Ling Han turned around and walked into the palace.

So cold!

Lmg Han couldn’t help but shiver. He hurriedly activated the power of flames, yet discovered that this was completely useless.

This coldness did not originate from his physical body, but rather… from his soul. It was as if he had entered into the underworld.
