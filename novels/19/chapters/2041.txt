Chapter 2042: Opening up the Source Powers of heaven and earth for development

Hong, long, long,?inside Ling Han’s body, the four Source Powers were all flickering, as if they were about to slice open the heavens and earth.

What was a Source Power of heaven and earth?

It was a part of the foundations of the world when the heaven and earth first split apart, and had a unique significance!

For example, though the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water would disappear, the heaven and earth would eventually nurture them anew. Unless this heaven and earth also died, the Source Powers of heaven and earth would exist eternally.

Ling Han had a feeling that he was far from having released the full might of the Source Powers of heaven and earth inside his body. Otherwise, his battle prowess would be able to improve further, and he would truly be able to match Ji Wuming, or even surpass him.

He battled fiercely with Long Butian as he continued to ponder a way to make himself even stronger.

Before this, he had already been considering this problem, and already had some vague idea, but he had never put it into practice.

It was very simple, and that was to inscribe formations inside his body.

In the Ancient Realm, he had already tried this, and the effects were astonishingly good, but in the Celestial Realm, this was an impossible feat.

Celestial-level formations were incredibly massive, such as a Great Mountain Protection Formation, or the formation inscribed on a battleship. To inscribe formations on the Godly bones inside the body, this could not be said to be impossible, but at least for now, Ling Han was not able to do so yet.

Then how was he supposed to inscribe formation patterns?

Use the Source Powers of heaven and earth!

The Source Powers of heaven and earth were at the Celestial King Tier. As long as he could guide a sliver of their might, supreme battle prowess would be able to burst out. And what Ling Han had to do was to release this might.

How to release this might?

Using the relationship of restraint and support among the Five Elements.

Though there were only four Source Powers of heaven and earth at present, which could not form a perfect circle of the Five Elements, but there was only the shortage of one, so he should still be able to guide it, though the might would be considerably weaker.

‘Let’s test it out.’

Ling Han activated a Source Power of heaven and earth.?Boom, it turned into an incredibly ancient seal that was inscribed onto one of his Godly bones. Then, it began to slowly dissipate. The secrets of the heaven and earth could never have been inscribed.

He activated a Source Power of heaven and earth again, and inscribed on the second Godly bone, and then it was the third.

However, he had not even activated the fourth Source Power of heaven and earth when the seal on the first Godly bone had already completely dimmed.

No, he was too slow.

Ling Han thought, ‘Then let’s try again.’

Boom!

He was trying fiercely inside his body, and in the outside world, Long Butian was also intensely battling him. He had completely suppressed Ling Han. His hands formed claws, palm strikes, and punches that endlessly barraged Ling Han’s body.

However, though Ling Han was slightly distracted, his defense was not the slightest bit breached. No matter how Long Butian attacked him, he was still completely unhurt, causing Du Shaojun and his group who were spectators to frown.

How could there possibly be a freak with such frightening defense?

Ling Han continued to study his new move inside his body. He had a feeling that he was close to succeeding.

“91.

“92.

“93.”

On the outside world, everyone was counting, and the limit of 100 moves was already close at hand.

Peng, peng, peng.?The more Long Butian fought, the more intense his attacks became. Since Young Master Du said he was to spar with Ling Han, that meant that there was no longer any animosity between both of them, but as an elite, he still wanted to win.

Though Ling Han had been beaten submissively all this while, this was not the result that Long Butian wanted. Instead, he wanted a victory that could not be doubted and that he had obtained after battling to his heart’s content.

Hence, his battle prowess was on full throttle, pouring out a mad barrage of attacks on Ling Han.

“99!”

Weng, right at this moment, a majestic light flashed within Ling Han’s body. His aura suddenly strengthened by a good few times over, but it immediately dimmed back down.

Peng!

Ling Han took another blow, and his whole person was sent flying. Then, he landed back on the ground, sliding back at least a few hundred meters on the ground before he finally stopped.

“100!”

Long Butian still wanted to continue the assault, but after some thought, he did not do so in the end.

The battle had already ended.

He was the first to step out of the chessboard, and then Ling Han slowly flew back out. He looked completely dazed, as if he was preoccupied.

“I will befriend you.” Du Shaojun laughed, and took the initiative to stretch out a hand towards Ling Han.

Ling Han still looked completely blank, and stretched out his hand dumbly, shaking Du Shaojun’s hand.

“Since we’re friends now, come, let’s drink!” Du Shaojun pulled on Ling Han’s wrist, and invited him into the private room. Then, he said to the waiter, “Serve all the fine wines and dishes.”

“Niu wants to eat Immortal Beast meat, and it has to be at the Immortal Palace Tier!” Hu Niu hurriedly called out. She had no idea of the concept of being reserved.

A muscle involuntarily twitched in Du Shaojun’s cheek. Though his identity was illustrious, it had not reached the extent that he could dine on Immortal Palace Tier beasts willfully yet, but he had already boasted just now, so he could not bring himself to step back now.

He could only nod at the waiter, indicating that the latter could serve this dish.

“Got it!” That waiter hurriedly left with the order, his expression filled with happiness.

If this kind of precious meat was sold, he as the “promoter” would also be rewarded. Though he had not promoted anything at all this time, the bonus would still be written onto his account.

It was not too much, just 100 Star Stones, but for a minor character like him, 100 Star Stones was definitely considered an exorbitant sum.

Ruan Dongxiang also wanted to follow them into the private room. However, with a glance from Du Shaojun, a young man in yellow robes stretched out his arm with a chuckle, blocking Ruan Dongxiang from advancing any further.

“Young Master Du!” Ruan Dongxiang called out immediately.

“Get lost!” The expression of the young man in yellow robes turned cold. This kind of trash actually wanted to join their circle?

Previously, they had been deceived by him, so how could that even be possible now?

Ruan Dongxiang’s face was as red as blood. To him, this could be considered an unbearable humiliation. His hands clenched tightly, forming fists. After a while, he finally turned around and left furiously.

He would remember the humiliation today, and would definitely get his revenge in future!

Seeing him leave, the young man in yellow robes said, “Young Master Du, this person is clearly the type to hold grudges. Should we…” He made a motion that mimicked slitting the throat. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yet Du Shaojun only smiled faintly, and said, “So what if this kind of minor character holds a grudge? If he really dares to stretch out his hand, I will take his wretched life.”

The others all nodded. Du Shaojun was definitely qualified to say these words.

They then returned their attention to the banquet. Du Shaojun was a monarch tier, and had an elegant demeanor and grace. He could casually tell them of any interesting anecdotes, easily making them smile or roar with side-splitting laughter. He was completely dominating the atmosphere.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was completely sleepwalking the entire while, as if he had lost his soul.

Du Shaojun and his party thought that he was feeling despondent because of having lost to Long Butian, and all tried to console him.

After they were done with their meal, Du Shaojun ardently invited Ling Han and his group to visit his manor, but the Empress declined him tactfully. She helped support Ling Han as they returned to their accommodations. Anyone who was not in the know would think that Ling Han had gotten drunk.

However, the truth was that Ling Han was completely immersed in his own world.

In the final clash with Long Butian, he had finally successfully grasped a sliver of opportunity, and seen a way to boost the Source Powers of heaven and earth. However, this kind of inspiration had passed in a flash, and he had been earnestly trying to recall it all this while. Thus, it looked like he had been struck dumb, causing Du Shaojun and his party to misunderstand that he was feeling unhappy due to having lost.

After returning to the inn, he immediately entered into the Black Tower, and went into comprehension underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

In the outside world, three days’ time passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside the Black Tower, a change that turned everything completely upside down was taking place in Ling Han’s body. On each of the four Godly bones, there was an ancient seal flickering, but always when the last one lit up, the first one would dim, and they could not light up all at once.

“That’s it!” He suddenly snapped his eyes open.?Weng, his eyes blazed, capable of piercing through the darkness.

Weng, on the four Godly bones, four seals lit up simultaneously.
