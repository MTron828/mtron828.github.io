2901 Mission complete

The Power of Dimension was extremely terrifying.

Even if it was a super low-level dimension that could only produce First Tier Heavenly Venerates, it would require at least Second Tier’s strength to destroy its dimensional core. In the past, the Foreign Realm had invaded the Celestial Realm, and it was precisely because it was deterred by the Power of Dimension that even Heavenly Venerates could not invade it. They could only rely on the Foreign Realm itself to suppress it and commence the Realm War.

Right now, the Flaming Frost Realm was a transcendent dimension, and even Sixth Tiers would only be reduced to ashes should they face it head-on. Although Seventh Tiers were undying and indestructible, there was a limit to their power, and they, too, were unable to invade the core.

However, it was Hysteria’s doing this time.

!!

Endless black Qi spread out like a net. However, there were small tentacles on the net that surrounded the dimensional core.

The black Qi couldn’t be stopped or destroyed. It was extremely difficult to deal with.

This was Hysteria, the most dangerous existence in history.

The black Qi descended slowly but incredibly steadily. In the end, it completely covered the dimensional core and sank into it. Instantly, the dimensional core trembled violently. Peng, peng, peng! Violent energy shot out from it, and its power was incomparably terrifying.

Even Ling Han’s expression changed. This could easily kill a Fifth Tier elite.

Without another word, he turned around and left.

Ba Duo did not dare to stay any longer, either, and hurriedly left with Ling Han.

Since the mission was completed, there was no point in staying here any longer.

Xiu, xiu! The two of them flew out of the ground layer. Ba Duo looked at Ling Han coldly, and said, “I will find you for a battle.”

“Then why don’t we do it now? I guarantee that you’ll yield!” Ling Han said casually. In his eyes, this Ba Duo was just a matter that could be resolved with a single punch.

“Humph!”

Ba Duo didn’t reply. With a flash, he disappeared without a trace.

Ling Han stood quietly. This time, he could be considered to have completed Hysteria’s mission and proven his allegiance. Next, he should be able to obtain the acceptance of Meng Dong and the others. From there, he would dig out all the traitors and eliminate them one by one.

Hurry, hurry! He didn’t want to waste time on such matters and affect his cultivation.

He returned to the primitive overlapping dimension. After finding the Empress and Hu Niu, he continued their expedition to explore for veins of ore.

The gains here were huge, but no force had proceeded to set up a raw stone lane right now. Because the cost of digging was too high, requiring a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate to personally do it, they all directly mined and opened the stones immediately.

This meant that Ling Han had one less channel to obtain treasure, but there was no other grandmaster of raw stone that could enter this place. Ling Han was the only one.

While others were randomly digging, he was purposeful and selective, so his gains were still far greater than others’.

Moreover, his current battle prowess was at the Fifth Tier, and when the combination seals displayed their might, he could even suppress the majority of Fifth Tier elites. Naturally, this gave Ling Han a huge advantage in battle.

There were more and more Heavenly Venerable Seals in his possession, and from here onwards, the Heavenly Venerable Seals were basically of the eighth grade.

Could he collect another set of combination seals, a complete set of eighth-grade seals?

After excavating all the veins of ore in this dimension, Ling Han and the others headed towards the seventh dimension.

However, even Third Tiers could not pass through here. The flames formed by the friction and burning of fundamental particles could easily incinerate Third Tiers into ashes, and even Fourth Tiers would have to go all out to resist the extreme heat.

It was extremely tough even for the Empress and Hu Niu, who managed to rely on their own strength to pass through the ground layer of the sixth dimension and enter into the seventh dimension.

Here, there were naturally fewer people, and this dimension was smaller and more dilapidated. If there was only 1% of the sixth level left, then there would only be 0.1% of the seventh left.

Ling Han was extremely careful. Right now, there were many people watching him, and as long as a few Fifth Tiers joined forces, they would be able to put him in a very tough situation. Furthermore, there were also Sixth Tiers as well. This was an existence that he absolutely could not match right now, and he could even be insta-killed.

Tens of thousands of years later, this dimension was once again completely excavated.

Thus, the battlefield shifted to the eighth dimension again.

Here, only Fifth Tier elites could enter.

Even the Celestial Guest Residence was not very safe, so Ling Han had the Empress and Hu Niu bring it with them. The two women directly returned to the first dimension, while Ling Han went deeper into the eighth dimension. This should also be the last dimension he could explore.

Because one had to be at least a Fifth Tier to enter this place, the number of Heavenly Venerates had suddenly decreased to around 1,000, and no matter how dilapidated this plane was, it was still shockingly large, allowing every Heavenly Venerate to gain a lot.

After 7,000 years, Ling Han decided to return because he had explored all the places that could be explored, and he had also tried to go to the next dimension, but he was completely unable to do so. The flames there could insta-kill Fifth Tiers, so there was no need to take such a huge risk.

Ling Han also returned to the first dimension. After reuniting with the Empress and the others, he waited for news from Zhou Heng and the others.

Another 3,000 years later, Zhou Heng and the others returned.

Ling Han went to find out about the situation, and learned that even a Sixth Tier could only stop at the ninth dimension. The 10th dimension could only be explored by a Seventh Tier, and no one knew if the 10th dimension was the end at all. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There might even be an 11th, 101st, or infinite dimensions.

“Master and the other Seventh Tier great elites already have some guesses, but they’re currently fighting against the main body of Hysteria, so they can’t free themselves to take a look at it personally, so they can’t confirm which guess is correct,” Chu Hao said.

“It’s almost time for us to return as well.”

The value of this group of primitive dimensions lay in the raw stones. After the raw stones were all mined, what was the point of them staying here any longer?

“Yes, get ready. We should go back.” Zhou Heng nodded.

Everyone needed to prepare. Many people had come to the first dimension, including Celestial Kings, Ascending Origin Tiers, and so on. They needed Heavenly Venerates to help them transmigrate through the Void.

Ling Han prepared to go into seclusion. Over the years, he had obtained many eighth-grade seals. Although they had not formed a complete set, he had collected three super large combination talismans. One had 32 seals, another had 36 seals, and yet another had 40.

There were a total of 1,108 of them. Ling Han was only three seals away from collecting the whole set.

However, this wasn’t the most terrifying part. Once the eighth-grade seals were complete, they could be pieced together with the ninth-grade seals to form an even more astonishing set of combination seals.

Coincidentally, two of the three missing eighth-grade seals would connect two sets of eighth-grade combination seals, and the last one would connect the ninth- and eighth-grade combination seals. In other words, this was the first seal of the set of eighth-grade seals.

Should he slowly collect them from opening raw stones in the future?

Ling Han shook his head. All the raw stones that could’ve been mined had already been mined. Even if some forces still had stockpiles, who would be willing to take them out? Moreover, would it just so happen that these three particular seals would be unearthed?

He could either wait until he reached the Fifth Tier or even Sixth Tier, and then go deeper into the 10th and 11th dimensions. He believed that there would still be a large number of raw stones for him to complete this great sequence.

However, this would take too long.

Therefore, he planned to go into seclusion and deduce these three seals himself.
