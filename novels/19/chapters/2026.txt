Chapter 2027: Power of the Poisonous Fruit

After battling for several days, Lan Tianyang and Che Yuanhua discovered that... Xiao Gu couldn’t be hurt.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t be injured. Rather, it was useless even if they wounded him.

In fact, they had once managed to shatter Xiao Gu’s head after making huge sacrifices themselves. However, what use had it been? Xiao Gu had casually regrown another head.

In reality, Xiao Gu’s entire body was a creation of his. As long as his Celestial Bone existed, he would exist. Thus, what did it matter if his head were smashed?

At this moment, Che Yuanhua and Lan Tianyang felt like giving up and retreating.

They couldn’t defeat Xiao Gu.

Whoosh!

They leaped into the sky, unwilling to battle with Xiao Gu any longer. Otherwise, their fate would definitely be death.

They didn’t want to suffer punishment, but they more so didn’t want to die here.

Thus, they decided to flee even if their secret would be revealed. They refused to fight to the death with Xiao Gu.

In any case, the closer they were to the ancient castle—or the two stone statues, to be more exact—the more power they could draw on. As such, it was only natural that they make their way back up. Battling underground wouldn’t help them a single bit.

Ling Han waited for a moment before also sheathing his sword. He had already absorbed most of the essence of metal in this place.

With a flash, he flew out of the cave.

He arrived outside, only to see that Xiao Gu was still engaged in an intense battle with Lan Tianyang and Che Yuanhua. Meanwhile, the people on the island were all gathered around to spectate. They were all stunned by this scene.

Wasn’t it said that with the protection of their deity, they would be invincible among those at the same cultivation level? However, there had first been Ling Han, and now there was another mysterious “Ling Han”—right now, Xiao Gu had the exact same appearance as Ling Han. What in the world was this?

Lan Tianyang and Che Yuanhua were clearly struggling immensely, and this was a huge blow to the islanders’ confidence.

Xiao Jun immediately leaped over, and asked, “Brother Ling, what’s going on?” He was wearing a baleful expression as he glared at Ling Han.

Right now, the person who was fighting with the Island Master and the island envoy looked exactly the same as Ling Han. Thus, who would believe that there was no relationship between them?

“Are you questioning me?” Ling Han asked.

“I am,” Xiao Jun replied in a haughty voice. His battle prowess was indeed inferior to Ling Han’s. Right now, however, there were around 10 Eighth Lotus elites in the surroundings. These elites were equivalent to Immortal Palace Tier elites, so what did he need to fear?

“Oh, I’m not sure what’s going on,” Ling Han said, shrugging. He completely denied any relationship with Xiao Gu.

“Ling Han!” Xiao Jun roared.

“Ling Han, we also need an explanation,” the visitors to the island said. Many of them wore expressions of displeasure.

They had just defeated a beast tide, and they had just been enjoying the blessings of a deity. Yet, such a furious battle had suddenly erupted, and the assailant was more so identical in appearance to Ling Han. Thus, they were naturally filled with displeasure.

‘You’re purposefully targeting us, right?’

“Explanation?” Ling Han scoffed. “What right do you have to seek an explanation from me?”

“You’re going too far!” the visitors to the island roared.

“Lord Qin, this person is far too detestable!”

“My Lord, please capture him!”

Qin Wei frowned slightly upon hearing this, and he said, “Ling Han, we’re guests on this island right now. Since we’re guests, it’s best that we don’t offend the hosts.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “What a bunch of fools. You’re being toyed around with like monkeys, yet you don’t even realize! I understand the feeling, the thirst, of wanting to obtain more power. However, can’t you use your a*s to think for a moment? Are there truly such generous people in the world?

“Even if there are, do these people look like it to you?”

Lan Ruozhi immediately leaped forward, and said, “Young Master Ling, enough with the nonsense. Perhaps you don’t want me anymore?”

Ling Han involuntarily shuddered. “Stop trying to disgust me!”

“You...” Lan Ruozhi’s slender body shuddered slightly, and her expression instantly changed. She thought extremely highly of herself, and she was convinced that she was as beautiful as a celestial maiden. In fact, all men should have been intoxicated by her beauty.

Yet, Ling Han was actually treating her with such disdain! This was naturally a huge blow to her dignity, and it caused her to descend into wild fury.

“Junior Sister, it’s best that you give up on him,” Xiao Jun said with a cold chuckle. “His heart is filled with evil, and his actions are filled with suspicious intent. I suggest that we capture him and directly pluck his soul.”

“Enforcement officers, please capture this person!” he said to the Eighth Lotus elites.

“I’ll capture him,” a middle-aged man said, and stepped forward. A lotus with eight petals suddenly materialized between his brows.

This was a unique symbol of their cultivation technique, one which was usually hidden.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Why don’t you all come at me together. That way, I can save some time.”

“You’re but a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator, yet you dare to speak to me with such audacity?!” the middle-aged man said with a sneer. To say nothing of receiving a blessing from the deity, even if he didn’t, those at the Eighth Lotus were still equivalent to Immortal Palace Tier elites. As such, suppressing a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator would be as easy as a flip of his hand.

Ling Han started to accumulate power. With his strength, he naturally couldn’t hope to rival an Immortal Palace Tier elite. However, he still had an ultimate trump card.

Thump, thump, thump...

The middle-aged man strode over, with each of his steps giving off a deep and heavy thud that shook one’s heart.

He was threatening Ling Han, and he was placing pressure on Ling Han.

“Brat, I truly don’t understand. Where is your courage coming from?” the middle-aged man asked with a cold sneer.

“You’re about to find out!” Ling Han said with a grin. There was a glimmer of danger in his eyes.

His Cracking Light Sphere had already finished charging.

Boom!

Arcs of lightning instantly exploded into the surroundings.

The middle-aged man couldn’t help but sneer in disdain. This attack was indeed powerful. However, it could at most only threaten a Seventh Lotus elite. To an Eighth Lotus elite like him, such an attack wouldn’t pose any threat at all.

The elite activated a small portion of his defenses.

Crack, crack, crack...

Arcs of lighting gathered on his shield of black light, yet they were completely unable to penetrate it.

This was completely expected. After all, it would be truly strange if a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator could breach the defenses of an Immortal Palace elite.

However, this was the Cracking Light Sphere, and its target wasn’t only the middle-aged man. Instead, this was an attack that didn’t differentiate between friend and foe, and would attack everyone within its range. In fact, if Ling Han overcharged it, it might even cause damage to Ling Han himself.

Thus, the arcs of violent lightning also shot toward the people in the surroundings.

However, because these people were standing relatively far away, the lightning did little damage to them even if it struck them. These arcs of lightning possessed little power, so their damage could almost be completely ignored.

However, was this truly the case?

The middle-aged man wore a disdainful smile, and he was just about to step forward to kill Ling Han. “Playtime is over, brat. You— Huh?!” His expression changed drastically.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

His shield of black light was being rapidly corroded by the arcs of lightning.

At the same time, screams of agony immediately sounded in the surroundings. Looking around, one could see that many people had already collapsed to the ground, with their bodies being rapidly corroded.

What in the world was going on?

Ling Han was only a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator, so how had he unleashed an attack that could even threaten an Eighth Lotus elite?

The elite was immediately plunged into a desperate situation. A vicious corrosive power was rapidly piercing through his defenses and yearning to destroy his body. At this moment, he had no option but to sit down and resist this attack with his full power.

“Aaah...!” Screams of pain and misery echoed around the surroundings. However, these screams disappeared just as quickly as they had appeared. This was because the people struck by the arcs of lightning had already transformed into puddles of blood!

‘F*ck! What the hell is this?’

To say nothing of others being petrified, even Ling Han was deeply astonished by the power of this attack. The Red Spotted Green Bamboo was far too freakish.

Indeed, his Cracking Light Sphere had only been a decoy attack. In reality, he had used this attack to conceal and deliver the poison of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo.

This was poison that could even kill Immortal Palace Tier elites.

Thud, thud, thud...

The remaining people hurriedly retreated. There was terror in their eyes, and as they looked at Ling Han, it was as if they were looking at a sinister demon.
