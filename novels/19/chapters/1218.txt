Chapter 1219: Ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Empress Luan Xing dispersed the Chaos Qi on her face, and revealed an exquisite beauty that could put the world in chaos—especially that enchanting grace. Even if Hu Niu was not inferior to her in terms of beauty, in terms of bearing, she was not just a little bit weaker.

After all, Hu Niu was still young, so her grace had not fully developed. In the future, it might be that she would not be inferior to her in the slightest, but as of now, Empress Luan Xing was definitely the greatest source of calamity, and there was no other.

Involuntarily, Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He would not get tired of looking at her even after seeing this source of calamity for a hundred times. Furthermore, when he was with her, he would automatically forget any other person, and could only think of her.

This was the enchantment of the empress.

“I want to ask you some questions,” she said solemnly.

“Hehe, why are you acting so serious with me now?” Ling Han laughed, his eyes drifting slightly lower. “Were you not obedient, and so want me to punish you a bit?”

Empress Luan Xing knew what part of her he was looking at, and involuntarily felt irritated and embarrassed.

When she was spanked, though it was not her main body, it was her divine sense that was dominant, so she naturally felt it as if it was truly done to her. Now, as Ling Han deliberately stared at that part of her like this, she only felt her face was burning, and a red blush involuntarily appeared.

“You dare take liberties with me? Are you not afraid I would suppress you?” She humphed, putting on the forceful presence of an empress.

Ling Han coughed, clasped his hands, and greeted, “I pay my respects to the empress!”

How insincere!

Empress Luan Xing raised her hand carelessly, and said, “Forget it, I have something to ask you!”

Hearing her say so twice, Ling Han, too, became serious. Though this empress was exquisitely beautiful, she was obviously a very easily embarrassed woman. She could not endure teasing at all, and his relationship with her was not so good that he could speak sweet words to her, so it was best that he stopped before going too far.

“What do you want to ask?” he asked.

“About the Celestial Realm!” Empress Luan Xing said, a complicated expression appearing on her beautiful face, a mix of both loneliness and fury.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “Then come into the Black Tower, and I will call Small Tower out as well.”

Empress Luan Xing paused involuntarily. After entering into the Black Tower, everything would be under Ling Han’s control. Previously, she had been spanked, so she still had lingering fear.

Ling Han’s expression darkened, and he asked, “Am I that kind of vile character?”

Empress Luan Xing did not answer, but the word ‘yes’ was written all over her face.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han flopped down on the ground, and said, “Fine, then. Since you distrust me so much, don’t go in to cultivate in the future again!”

“Humph, everything underneath the heavens is my territory, and all are my subjects! Everything that is yours is mine, but I permit you to possess it,” Empress Luan Xing said proudly. “So, don’t get things wrong!”

Looking at her proud countenance, Ling Han couldn’t help but feel an itch in his heart. This filled him with an incredibly strong desire to conquer her.

The enchantment of this seductive beauty seemed to have increased again.

Ling Han forced down the impulse, and said, “Forget it, let us not speak of this. Is there some relation between you and the Celestial Realm?”

Empress Luan Xing hesitated slightly, and then answered, “My ancestors... originated from the Celestial Realm!”

‘What?!’

Ling Han was stunned, then suddenly clapped his hands, and said, “I know, do all ancient divine tribes originate from the Celestial Realm?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Empress Luan Xing nodded. “That’s right. Ancient divine tribes are all tribes that have been expelled from the Celestial Realm. Because they possess the bloodline of the Celestial Realm, they are comparatively stronger.”

Luan Xing looked at Empress Luan Xing in surprise. He had been just talking about the Celestial Realm, and here came a descendant from the Celestial Realm. He asked in a dark voice, “You spoke of being expelled?”

“The exact time period is too ancient to remember. A war happened in the Celestial Realm, involving the whole Celestial Realm. In that war, a great many elites died, and after the war ended, the losing side was all chased out of the Celestial Realm,” Empress Luan Xing said.

Ling Han’s heart beat wildly. This was definitely a ground-shattering secret.

“Then you want to return to the Celestial Realm?” he asked.

Empress Luan Xing nodded slowly. “Returning to the Celestial Realm is the conviction of the whole Nine Snake Tribe that has been passed through the generations.” She looked at Ling Han, and then continued, “That little girl should be the heir of some great sect from the Celestial Realm.”

She was referring to Hu Niu.

“The Roc Palace,” Ling Han said.

“It has been too long, and there are only very limited records of the Celestial Realm left behind within the tribe.” Empress Luan Xing sighed. “In the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe, there is a Nine Snake Pond. Every member of the Nine Snake Tribe needs to bathe within to be able to fully activate her bloodline. To the Nine Snake Tribe, this is the most important inheritance.”

“So your most important motive in returning to the Celestial Realm is to regain the Nine Snake Pond?” Ling Han asked.

“It cannot be regained.” Empress Luan Xing shook her head. “The Nine Snake Pond is formed from a part of the remains of the ancestor of the Nine Snake Tribe, and the body of our ancestor is buried in the ancestral grounds. It has already become one with the mountains and plains, and cannot possibly be moved.”

“So if the Nine Snake Tribe wants to regain their glory, they can only return to the ancestral grounds?” Ling Han asked.

“Yes.” An expression of loneliness appeared on Empress Luan Xing’s face. “However, I am now the only one left of the Nine Snake Tribe.”

“Don’t worry!” Ling Han stretched out his hands to hold Empress Luan Xing’s shoulders. “In the future, we will have a whole bunch of children to bolster the bloodline of the Nine Snake Tribe.”

Pa, his hands had not yet landed when they were already smacked away by Empress Luan Xing. The pain was enough to make him grit his teeth. This empress was in the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, so a careless smack was enough to make him feel as if his bones had been broken.

“Do not be flippant!” Empress Luan Xing rebuked.

Ling Han snickered. If it was another man that dared to tease the empress like this, not even his bones would be left by now. However, he had only had his hands smacked away, which meant that there was still a place for him in the empress’s heart.

How could there not be? Previously, she had even stood in opposition to an Eternal River Tier for his sake.

Her words were sharp, but she was a softie at heart. ‘I like that.’

Ling Han nodded, and seriously said, “We will definitely charge into the Celestial Realm together!”

Empress Luan Xing paused for a moment, and then said, “I do not know what you desire, but be cautious on your journey!”

“Don’t worry, I will definitely return safe and sound!” Ling Han said. “Celestial Realm... what kind of place is that?”

“It is the celestial plane that exists in legends, where elites could possess eternal life,” Empress Luan Xing said.

‘An eternal existence. The moment a ********** conflict arises, it is indeed irresolvable,’ Ling Han thought. When people lived too long, they would naturally have nothing to take up their time, and would have some nonsense thoughts. Furthermore, the many elders would not die even with the passage of one generation after another, so the conflict would only deepen, and eventually culminate in war.

Then, since one war had started, it was possible for a second and third to follow.

The Celestial Realm did not seem that divine.

“Do not worry about your Great Ling Empire, I will guard it well on your behalf,” Empress Luan Xing continued. Then, with a wave of her fluttering robes, she said, “I am leaving.”

“Hold on,” Ling Han called out.

Empress Luan Xing stopped and turned around, a questioning look on her face.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “Once we separate now, it will definitely take a great many years before we next meet. Aren’t you going to give me a farewell hug?”

Empress Luan Xing immediately rolled her eyes at him, the Qi of chaos once more enshrouding her beautiful face. She spat out only two words. “Get lost!”
