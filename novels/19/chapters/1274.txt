1275 The Heaven“s Sword Palace has Come Again

The dark clouds dispersed after half a day.

The old ginseng had successfully passed his heavenly tribulation. Although his battle prowess wasn’t impressive, he possessed a remarkable vitality due to his identity as a wood spirit, one of the spirits of the five elements. Thus, although he had been riddled with wounds after passing the tribulation just then, portions of his body had already fully healed.

He was still covered in wounds, but his aura was tens of thousands of times more powerful than before. The gulf between the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier and the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier was like the gulf between heaven and earth.

“Old ginseng has reached the Sun Moon Tier, so he’s definitely more nutritious now,” Rabbit said as he drooled. It looked like he wanted to hop over and devour the old ginseng as if he were a carrot.

This wasn’t any ordinary Godly medicine. This was a Godly medicine that had developed intelligence, absorbed the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, and cultivated to become a ginseng king. Thus, the old ginseng was definitely numerous times more nutritious than ordinary Level Five Godly medicine.

“Hahaha, what great luck! There’s actually a ginseng king facing its heavenly tribulation here!

“Spirits of the five elements are inherently favored by heaven and earth. Ginseng kings are more so brimming with life essence. If I ingest one, it will not only elevate my cultivation level, but even increase my lifespan by tens of thousands of years!”

There was long laughter, and seven men appeared before them. They were all at the Sun Moon Tier, though their specific cultivation levels were quite uneven, ranging from the low extreme to the consummate level. Thus, their age also differed greatly. Some of them were middle-aged men who were brimming with energy, while some of them were old men who had completely white hair.

However, the path of cultivation was extremely dependent on one’s talent. As such, those who were old wouldn’t necessarily possess a higher cultivation level, while those who were young wouldn’t necessarily possess a lower cultivation level.

Ling Han had just faced heavenly tribulation as well, and a smile involuntarily tugged at his mouth when he saw the seven men.

After having a chance encounter with members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, he had learned to observe whether people had unique insignias on their clothes. The seven men were clearly companions, so it was extremely likely that they were all members of the same force.

After a quick glance, he immediately discovered the sword that was sewn onto their sleeves.

What an incredible coincidence! It was the Heaven’s Sword Palace again!

In fact, this coincidental encounter was completely understandable. The Heaven’s Sword Palace had lost an extremely valuable treasure map here, after all, and they had already sent a team of disciples to search for it. Since these people had gone missing, the Heaven’s Sword Palace naturally sent more people to search for the map.

The seven members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace naturally saw Ling Han and the others as well. However, they found this group of “people” incredibly strange—there was a human, a Demonic Beast, and a wood spirit.

“Huh? This human...!” One of the middle-aged men wore a strange expression as he looked at Ling Han. He felt that this person looked slightly familiar.

“Ancestor Liu, is there something strange about this person?” someone asked.

The middle-aged man suddenly clapped his hands, and exclaimed, “Ling Han!”

“Ling Han?” The other six men were extremely confused. They had never heard of this name before.

“He’s the criminal who opened the sky and brought the Lower Realm into the Immortal Realm!” the middle-aged man spat through gritted teeth. Anger burned in his eyes.

In the Immortal Realm, Sun Moon Tier forces were utterly insignificant. The Five Sects had only obtained the Lower Realm by chance, and they had all viewed this small world as a precious treasure. In fact, before Ling Han’s feat, they had already farmed the Lower Realm for 1,000,000 years.

Their harvests had been bountiful, and they would obtain several Realm Pills every 10,000 years. These Realm Pills had allowed the Five Sects to raise numerous Sun Moon Tier elites.

One would understand the significance of these Realm Pills once they compared the Five Sects to other Sun Moon Tier forces. Whether it was in terms of absolute number or percentage, the Five Sects all had far more Sun Moon Tier elites than other Sun Moon Tier forces.

This was all thanks to the Realm Pills.

However, following Ling Han’s feat of opening the sky, their farm of Realm Pills had gone up in a puff. It had become a mere memory. This naturally caused the higher-ups of the Five Sects to loathe Ling Han. They viewed him as someone who had to be killed.

The problem was, they had no idea where the Lower Realm had gone after it ascended into the Immortal Realm. As such, they naturally had no idea where Ling Han had gone, either. That being the case, regardless of how powerful they were, there was absolutely nothing they could do.

Moreover, the refinement of Realm Pills was far too damaging to the harmony of heaven, so only the true higher-ups and those who were sent to the small world knew of this secret. Thus, most members of the Five Sects had no idea who Ling Han was.

However, after Ling Han opened the sky, the Five Sects immediately listed him as their number one enemy. They had commanded their disciples to gather information on his whereabouts, and it seemed like they were hell-bent on killing him, no matter where he had gone.

Thus, killing intent instantly appeared on the remaining six people’s faces when they heard that Ling Han was the person who had opened the sky.

“Ancestor Liu, are you sure?” a white-haired elder asked. Although he looked old, his cultivation was only at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. However, his lifespan was shorter, so he naturally aged quicker.

The others all nodded in agreement. How many years had it been since Ling Han opened the sky and arrived in the Immortal Realm? How could he have possibly reached the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier already? This was far too unbelievable. Had he perhaps ingested some supreme Divine Pill?

“I’m certain! It’s definitely him!” the middle-aged man said, his voice dripping with hate. He had seen Ling Han’s divine sense before, and the aura of a cultivator’s divine sense was incredibly hard to change.

This middle-aged man was called Liu Shi, and he was an orphan who had been adopted and raised by the Heaven’s Sword Palace. He was the 10th infant to be adopted, so he was named Liu Shi[1]. 3,000,000 years had now passed, and he had already grown from a small orphan to a formidable pillar of the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

“What luck! We’ll kill this brat today, then obtain a ginseng king while we’re at it!” the others said with a cold smile.

“Obtain your mom!” the old ginseng immediately shouted. “You people are still 8,000,000 years too young to eat your Grandpa Ginseng! Little Han, beat them up for me! There’s no need to go easy on them! If you kill them, I’ll cover for you!”

However, he continued to retreat as he shouted this. Just look at his thin arms and thin legs... How would he dare to face so many elites head-on?

Ling Han drew his sword, and said, “Since we all know each other’s identity, let’s save the nonsensical talk. Come, let’s battle!”

“You’re a mere ant!” Liu Shi said in disdain. In the eyes of Immortal Realm elites, people from small worlds were naturally nothing more than ants. In fact, they were even lower than ants. If they didn’t think this, how could they have ruthlessly refined the people of the Lower Realm into Realm Pills?

Yet, an ant actually dared to challenge them right now! How impudent!

The cultivation speed of this brat was indeed astounding. However, he was only at the medium extreme, so what did it matter even if he were a five-star genius? Before the seven of them, he most likely couldn’t even withstand a single strike.

“Kill him!” Liu Shi commanded. It was beneath him to deal with such an ant himself.

“Understood!” the six people replied. They all charged at Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was itching to do battle.

He had advanced to the middle stage of the medium extreme, and his battle prowess had soared to the peak stage of the high extreme. Add to that his Divine Demon Sword, and his battle prowess was easily on par with that of elites at the early stage of the consummate level. Moreover, this was already discounting the suppressive ability of the heaven’s might that he could unleash. In addition to all this, he still had a huge weapon in the Misty Soul Capturing Flower.

With Liu Shi standing back, the six others were like mere children before him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Han swung his Divine Demon Sword as he charged forward. Sword projections intertwined, and killing intent soared into the sky.

Liu Shi’s expression instantly changed. Almost everyone in the Heaven’s Sword Palace used a sword as their weapon, and he was no different. He was also a sword-wielding elite. Thus, he couldn’t help but feel deeply astonished upon seeing Ling Han’s attack. He knew that he had severely underestimated Ling Han’s strength.

“Hurry! Retreat!” he shouted frantically. At the same time, he hurriedly dashed toward Ling Han.

[1] Liu Shi literally means Liu number 10.
