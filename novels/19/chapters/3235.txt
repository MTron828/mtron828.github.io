3236 Who Has a Higher Status?

“Arrogant!” Hu Can scoffed. What a joke. Did he think he was invincible just because he blocked his attack?

He nonchalantly struck out with his palm, striking towards Ling Han.

Ling Han’s expression was calm, like the water in an ancient well without any ripples. He swung his fist, and the force superimposed twenty times!

BANG!

Hu Can’s expression changed drastically when the punch landed. The power he had unleashed was actually completely disintegrated. A terrifying power rushed over, causing him to involuntarily retreat.

On the other hand, Ling Han was standing steadily.

Ah?

Hu Can’s face was a little pale. Under the oscillation of power, he almost vomited.

He was actually at a disadvantage in this exchange?

How was this possible!

“You, what secret technique did you use?” His face was full of shock and confusion.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Your innate talent is too poor, so you wouldn’t understand even if I told you.”

In these two attacks, he had already grasped the frequency of Hu Can’s attacks. Thus, under the overlap of power, he broke through Hu Can’s attacks.

This was also because the difference in strength between the two of them was not too great. If Hu Can was in the Extreme Bone Tier, then even if Ling Han grasped the frequency of the other party’s attacks, it would be useless. It was just like how a group of people could collapse a bridge, but could a group of ants achieve the same feat?

“I’ve already said, you would only be able to block!” Ling Han charged out again.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The two of them continued to clash, Hu Can was forced back repeatedly, he was clearly at a disadvantage.

Seeing this scene, the Hu Clan fell silent.

What could they say?

Even Lian Xuerong was so shocked that her scalp went numb. A Meridian Opening Tier cultivator could actually suppress a Fifth Change elite. Would anyone believe this?

That freakish person from the capital?

He was no match!

However, Ling Han was well aware of his own suffering. This was because if he wanted to destroy Hu Can’s attack frequency, he would have to use more than fifteen overlapping layers of power. Under such intense consumption, how long could he fight for?

It would only be around ten minutes, which was equivalent to the eruption of a Blood Transformation Tier.

Furthermore, when the Blood Transformation Tier’s power burst ended, his battle prowess would only fall back to its normal level. However, it was different for him. The power in his body would be completely exhausted, and he would completely lose the ability to fight any further.

But could he finish off Hu Can in ten minutes?

Ling Han shook his head in his heart. After all, Hu Can was a Fifth Change elite, and he could only suppress him. Furthermore, if Hu Can hadn’t used up all of his Qi and blood long ago, he definitely wouldn’t have dared to face him head-on. Otherwise, he would be courting death.

‘Sigh, I’m still a little weak,’ he sighed.

However, if others heard him, they would definitely scold him for being pretentious.

…You, a Meridian Opening Tier elite, have already suppressed a Fifth Change elite. What more do you want?

Ling Han continued to throw punch after punch, and thought to himself, ‘It’s about time to find an excuse to clean up the mess. Otherwise, it won’t be easy to clean up the mess.’

“What are you doing?” A cold voice sounded. It was not loud, but it was filled with dignity.

Ling Han’s memory was very good, and he immediately stopped. This was the best opportunity to stop.

However, Hu Can did not give up. With a loud cry, he still pounced towards Ling Han.

“Do you want to die?” The voice snorted coldly. Then, a palm slapped over. Peng, Hu Can was immediately sent flying as he spat out blood.

This was a suppression of power.

Hiss, who was this person?

“Butler Mu!” Lian Xuerong hurriedly bowed respectfully.

Although Butler Mu didn’t hold any position, he was a genuine Extreme Bone Tier cultivator, so who dared to disrespect him?

Only then did Hu Can realize that the person who had spoken was actually Butler Mu. He couldn’t help but cry out in frustration.

He had suffered this slap for nothing.

An Extreme Bone Tier had already spoken, yet he still didn’t stop. Wasn’t he asking for a beating?

“Greetings, Butler Mu.” He forcibly bowed.

The gap of a major cultivation level was essentially a crushing advantage. After all, there might only be one monster like Ling Han.

Butler Mu glanced at him coldly and said, “Banner Lord Lian, what’s going on?”

“Reporting to Butler Mu, this is what happened.” Lian Xuerong explained everything she knew, without bias on either side.

How could Hu Can let Lian Xuerong finish speaking? He hurriedly interrupted, “Butler Mu, listen to me!”

Slap! Butler Mu immediately slapped him and said coldly, “Did I let you speak?”

How could Hu Can dodge? After taking this blow, half of his face immediately swelled up.

Good blow.

Ling Han secretly praised Butler Mu in his heart. This master had a very bad temper. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Banner Lord Lian, continue,” Butler Mu said lightly.

“Yes.” Lian Xuerong nodded and continued.

After she finished speaking, Butler Mu looked at Hu Can and said, “It’s your turn.”

The corners of Hu Can’s mouth twitched. Only now was he allowed to speak? He no longer had any passion!

However, if he did not defend himself now, wouldn’t he be convicted?

He hurriedly said, “Reporting to Butler Mu, this matter is all Ling Han’s nonsense! He was clearly the one who sold the maidservant to my Little Ninth, but on the day of the wedding, he regretted it and came knocking on our door to demand revenge, which led to such a mess. I hope Butler Mu can differentiate clearly the right and wrong!”

“Nonsense, you were the ones who kidnapped me!” Huan Xue couldn’t help but interrupt.

Butler Mu glanced at Huan Xue and retracted his gaze without doing anything.

F***!

Hu Can almost went mad from anger. ‘Oh, if I interrupted, you would slap me. Why is there no punishment for this girl’s interruption then?’

This was too differential.

But could it be that Hu Can still dared to criticize Butler Mu?

He could only swallow his anger with a red face.

“The two of you have completely different stories. Should I believe Ling Han’s words, or yours?” Butler Mu looked at Hu Can.

What a question!

Without thinking, Hu Can immediately said, “This kid is just a small vice-captain of the Xuanqing Banner. He’s a complete soldier ruffian. How could his words be believed? But I’m the Clan Leader of the Hu Clan. My words carry weight!”

“Oh, so you’re saying that whoever has a higher status should be trusted?” Butler Mu asked.

‘Don’t be so straightforward!’

However, that was indeed the case. Why did no one dare to provoke the three major noble clans and the six minor noble clans?

That was just because they were the nine forces with the highest status in the city, and whoever provoked them would suffer losses.

Butler Mu nodded, and said, “Since that’s the case, I can only trust Ling Han.”

Pu!

Hu Can spluttered. Why?

‘Are you retarded?’

A vice-captain of the Xuanqing Banner could surpass him in terms of status?

Butler Mu glanced at Hu Can with a pitying look, as if the other party was a fool. He said indifferently, “Because the Alchemist Society hasn’t officially confirmed it, this matter hasn’t been publicized. However, I can tell you in advance that there’s a second High Level alchemist in Huju City.”

What, what, what, what?

Hu Can’s mind buzzed, and he almost saw stars.

A second High Level alchemist?

Although Butler Mu didn’t say Ling Han’s name, anyone who wasn’t a fool could guess that he was referring to Ling Han.

High Level alchemist?

How was this possible!
