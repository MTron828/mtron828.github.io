Chapter 2573: Where does your confidence come from?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It should be known that it was not just affecting the arrangements of fighters of the tournament grounds. Lu Li had even made it so that the Yin River Celestial King had stepped out for his sake. This kind of power was truly amazing.

“Lu Li, you are really impressive now!” Yang Xiaoling spoke up, a cold smirk on her face.

He had clearly seen her sitting here, but not only did Lu Li not pay respects to her, he even acted as if he had not seen her at all. He was really too bold.

“Yang Xiaoling, would you like to join my bed?” Lu Li looked towards Yang Xiaoling, unreservedly sweeping with his eyes over her breasts, hips, and thighs, and making no effort to conceal his desire. “Tonight, I will give you this chance.”

Yang Xiaoling’s expression involuntarily turned ice-cold. It was true that she enjoyed toying with men, but she had always been the one with the initiative. There had never been any man that dared to treat her like a plaything.

Who did Lu Li think he was? He dared to be so insolent in front of her?

Tang Yuan couldn’t help but smirk internally. Lu Li had really forgotten himself when he even dared to tease Yang Xiaoling. Didn’t he know that this poisonous spider was merciless and cruel?

Since he was courting death of his own volition, he deserved it!

“Your mouth is asking to be slapped!” Yang Xiaoling moved, grabbing out at Lu Li.

She was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, and Lu Li was only a Second Heaven Celestial King. The gap between them was as wide as the gap between heaven and earth. This attack was not anything that Lu Li could block at all.

Shua, sword light flashed, its radiance illuminating the sky.

Yang Xiaoling retreated suddenly. She lowered her head in shock, and saw that a wound had abruptly appeared on her left breast. There was presently blood gushing from this wound. This gash was bone-deep, and if it had been just the slightest bit deeper, her heart would have been destroyed.

She raised her head, and saw there was another young man behind Lu Li. He was slowly sheathing his sword, and blood was slowly dripping down the tip of the blade.

This was A’Yuan, and it was he that had moved in time previously. Not only had he protected Lu Li, he had even inflicted a light injury on Yang Xiaoling.

He was merely a Third Heaven Celestial King, yet could wound a Fourth Heaven Celestial King with a single strike. This was extremely freakish.

Lu Li laughed loudly. “Big Sister Ling, you had best just obediently come to my bed. My skill in that area isn’t too bad, and I guarantee that you will feel great pleasure.”

Yang Xiaoling’s pretty face was dark. She was stunned by how astonishingly powerful A’Yuan was, but what confused her even further was Lu Li’s boldness. His subordinate had wounded her, and not only was he not panicking or anxious, he more so dared to tease and even insult her.

What was the source of his confidence?

Similarly, neither Tang Yuan nor Zhao Shuang understood. However, there was one thing they could confirm: Lu Li was definitely no idiot, so there was no way that he would suddenly become crazy for no reason.

“Big Sister Ling, trust me, you will obediently come to my bed, and enjoy yourself beneath me,” Lu Li teased Yang Xiaoling again, but after speaking these words, he looked towards Tang Yuan.

“Tang Yuan, you too. I can wager with you that you will run to my manor, and kneel down to worship me, begging me to take you as my lackey.”

Though Tang Yuan was feeling ill at ease, he was still furious upon hearing this. He exclaimed, “Lu Li, has your head been kicked by a donkey? If I were to surrender to you, I might as well be a woman then!”

Lu Li revealed a devious grin, and flopped down on a seat. “Let’s just watch the show first. I want to see how this brat that dares to go against me will slowly be torn apart.”

Though Tang Yuan and the others were extremely displeased, the fact that A’Yuan was still standing expressionlessly, hand on the hilt of his sword, rendered them completely unable to show their ire.

Unless they could ask an elite to come and suppress A’Yuan, they would not be able to do anything to Lu Li at all.

The three of them also sat down angrily. As they watched the arena, they were pondering internally that they would carefully investigate Lu Li after they returned. Why had he suddenly become so bold, and what kind of backing did he actually have?

Their thoughts wandered in different directions, and in the arena, the battle between Ling Han and Niu Da was about to begin.

“Human pretty boy, I will definitely not grant you an easy death!” Niu Da said menacingly. “Before anyone who is related to you dies, I will allow you to live, and watch helplessly as these people die in front of you one after another.”

Ling Han was unmoved. The women were in his Spatial Celestial Tool, and it was fine even if the others all died. Thus, as long as he himself was fine, the women would also be fine too. He had completely no worries.

He broke into a grin. “I have to thank you.”

Thank him?

No matter how hard Niu Da thought, he had not expected these words to suddenly come from Ling Han. He faltered a while, and then asked, “Thank me for killing you?”

“My beef has almost run out, so you are here just in time,” Ling Han said smilingly, his eyes sweeping over Niu Da with a picky glance.

These were the eyes that surveyed a food ingredient!

Niu Da couldn’t help but rage. This brat had eaten his younger brother, and now was treating him as prey as well?

“It is you that is my prey!” he shouted loudly, and couldn’t help but move.?Xiu, a silvery light blasted towards Ling Han.

He was a Fifth Heaven Monarch Star, and his strength was who knew how many times stronger than Niu Er’s. His Vitality Index had spiked to 10,000 points at that, even getting close to the height of 11,000 points. Even Ling Han was outmatched.

Ling Han’s figure flashed, dodging the silvery light.

Peng, the silvery light crashed into the wall surrounding the tournament ground, directly embedding itself within. However, there was still a little bit left exposed.

This was a silver bangle, and it was not known what material it was forged from, but it was frighteningly hard.

“Come!” Niu Da grabbed towards the bangle.?Xiu, the bangle immediately rocketed backwards, falling once more into his hoof.

Fury burned in Ling Han’s heart. He was not afraid of Niu Da, but Niu Da’s appearance was clearly against the rules. What need was there for him to suffer this silently? He loudly announced, “I want a change of opponent!”

According to the rules of the tournament, he had three chances to change his opponent, and after using this privilege, his row of successive wins would also be defaulted. He would have to start from the beginning again.

Niu Da naturally ignored it. Waving his bangle, he smashed it towards Ling Han again.

The commentator faltered. Ling Han’s request was justifiable, but Niu Da’s appearance had already broken the rules, yet it was supported by Yin River Celestial King, so this could no longer be judged as a normal situation.

Should he speak or not?

Right at this moment, he heard a voice again, issuing instructions for him.

He immediately listened intently, and then announced loudly, “Lord Yin River has spoken. The battle is to continue, and this battle has to end with death.”

‘What?!’

Even if this tournament was called the “Tournament of Death,” there was still a sliver of chance for survival. As long as one managed to flee into the safety passage, the opponent could not pursue him any further.

Of course, the fighting could still continue outside of this place, and he could still be killed. This was a place that had no laws.

But in the territory of the Azure Ghost Celestial King, if there were rules, you had to adhere to them. This was the authority of a Celestial King.

And now… it actually had to be ended with the death of either side?

There was no need to even consider. If it was a battle to the death, it would definitely be Ling Han dying.

Wasn’t it clear that he wanted Ling Han to die?

Ling Han heard this, and couldn’t help but sneer. This was really going too far!

His killing intent blazed, and he looked towards Niu Da.

Even if Niu Da’s cultivation level was higher, and his battle prowess also surpassed Ling Han’s, his heart also shuddered at this glance, a chill rising up his spine. However, he immediately suppressed this feeling. This was his enemy who had killed his brother; he was determined to kill him.

“Human trash, no matter how much you glare at me, it is useless. It can’t change your destiny, which is death!” He brandished the silver bangle, and it immediately grew large, turning into a metal circle that was four feet in diameter. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Waving the silver bangle, he smashed it straight down on Ling Han.
