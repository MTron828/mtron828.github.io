Chapter 1473 Charm of the Empress

Perhaps the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple would gain a new nickname from today onward—”Ancestor Wenxin”.

However, he still hadn’t realized it himself. Anyhow, he was beside himself with rage, and the bones inside his body all started to glow with a silver radiance. He was going to go all out and suppress this audacious woman. “Seeing that you’re a woman, I had already given you some slack. Yet, you still dared to provoke me!”

Empress Luan Xing rose nine meters into the air before pointing down at the senior disciple. Her expression was one of complete and utter contempt.

It was as if she were saying, “I disdain you!”

The spectating disciples were all enchanted by her prowess. The more proud and haughty she acted, the more they became attracted to her. In fact, they felt an urge to throw themselves at her feet and do anything that she pleased.

“Detestable!” The silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple lashed out, a beam of light shooting forth from his fingers. This beam of light then transformed into a whip that fused together with the power of his body as well as the might of his formations. It was overwhelmingly powerful.

This whip could kill even elites at the early stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

However, the empress was unafraid, and she charged forward with her brick.

Peng, peng, peng!

The two of them became locked in an intense battle. However, the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple was prepared this time, and thus he naturally wouldn’t be sent flying so easily again. Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing possessed the Absolute Beginning Stone, and was more so already at the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, she wasn’t afraid of the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple, either.

It wasn’t long before the battle reached its apex, with both of them bleeding and wounded.

Ling Han didn’t interfere.

Empress Luan Xing was also a supreme king tier, and she certainly hadn’t become the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire with her appearance alone. Instead, she had become the empress through her strength and abilities! If she wanted to grow more powerful in the future, she naturally couldn’t rely on cultivation alone. Battling against fellow prodigies was also an integral necessity.

Which elite hadn’t reached their position through intense competition and battles?

Thus, unless she was facing life-threatening danger, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t interfere in her battles.

Pa!

Empress Luan Xing exchanged a powerful attack with the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple, causing both of them to slide 300 or so meters back. The left sleeve of the senior disciple was torn apart, revealing his thick and toned arm. Meanwhile, the white face veil of Empress Luan Xing was also ripped into shreds, revealing her true appearance.

The empress’ clothes weren’t any ordinary clothes, with all of them being weaved from the feathers or fur of high-level Demonic Beasts. Thus, they could remain undamaged even after taking extremely powerful hits. However, the veil covering her face was far weaker than her clothes.

Although there was still an air of Primal Chaos shrouding her face, how could this obstruct the vision of Heavenly Body Tier and Eternal River Tier cultivators?

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

How could there exist such a perfect and beautiful woman?

She wasn’t just beautiful, but she was flawlessly beautiful. There wasn’t a single flaw with her appearance.

She was a stunning woman who could intoxicate people with her figure and demeanor alone. Now that her appearance had been revealed, who could still resist her tremendous charm?

Some of the disciples wore drunken expressions, while others were already starting to drool. Meanwhile, there were also some who were muttering in intoxication. The beauty of the empress was the embodiment of beauty in their imagination. Indeed, she was like a realization of their imaginations.

Just a second ago, the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple had been burning with rage. Now, however, his rage was subsiding with every passing second. Who could bear attacking such a beautiful and flawless woman?

However, would Empress Luan Xing pay any heed to this?

She was incredibly proud, so wasn’t it only natural that all of the beings in the world revered and bowed down to her? She mercilessly charged forward, swinging the brick as she did so. Her battle prowess hadn’t dipped a single bit.

Meanwhile, the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple was extremely flustered, his arms and legs a swinging mess as he tried to parry. That being the case, how could he still battle?

He was defeated by Empress Luan Xing after just a few more exchanges. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It wasn’t because he was weaker than her, but rather because he no longer had the desire to battle against her. He simply wanted to appreciate her beauty.

However, he paid a heavy price for this sudden change in attitude. The right side of his face was smacked by the brick again. The words “Name passed down for all eternity... Spread the might of my Yu Clan...” were especially clear.

The empress descended to the ground, her domineering aura instantly disappearing as she walked back to Ling Han. She gently leaned against him.

The disciples instantly turned around to glare at Ling Han, jealousy burning in their eyes.

To say nothing of the senior disciples, even the new disciples were gritting their teeth in jealousy. It was as if they wanted to bite Ling Han to death.

The charm of the empress was far too great.

“Woof! Little Han, you’re about to receive punishment from the heavens! I reckon it’s better if this beautiful maiden became my maid.” The large black dog was the first to betray Ling Han, immediately leaping over to bite at his bottom.

Ling Han knew that this despicable dog was full of evil tricks, so how could he have not been alert? He immediately clenched his fists and threw a punch.

Peng!

His fist smashed into the large black dog’s face. This was a punch that possessed the power of heaven’s might and divine lightning, so the large black dog’s body became numb from the lightning even though he possessed an astonishing physique.

“Ow! You black-hearted brat! You were actually guarding against Grandpa Dog? How petty of you! Where’s the most fundamental trust between people?” The large black dog instantly threw a barrage of accusations at Ling Han. It had clearly been him who had attacked first, yet he was instead blaming Ling Han for guarding against him.

“There’s no fundamental trust between humans and dogs,” Ling Han said with a chuckle. He swept his gaze around, only to discover that everyone looked as if they wanted to eat him alive. Sure enough, he had become public enemy number one after the sudden reveal of Empress Luan Xing’s true appearance.

Since this was the case... he would battle!

Ling Han laughed heartily, and said, “Who else wants me to crawl through this dog flap?”

“Humph! Traditions can’t be disregarded! You must bow your head today!” a senior disciple who had a pair of wings on his back stepped forward and said. However, both of his wings were composed of fish scales, with their perimeters razor-sharp and radiating a cold and Godly metal-like sheen.

“Attack together! Take him down!”

This senior disciple didn’t dare to act too arrogantly. Empress Luan Xing had already used her strength to prove the power of these new disciples. He didn’t want to go down the same path as Yi Gaoning or the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple.

The six Eternal River Tier elites attacked together, all of them charging toward Ling Han.

“You want to hurt my husband?” the empress asked with a proud humph. There was a supreme might in her beautiful eyes as she pointed forward with the Absolute Beginning Stone. Her aura was incredibly domineering.

“Come, let’s continue to battle together!” Ling Han was brimming with pride and confidence. He wouldn’t crawl through this dog flap even if he had to die. He would give his all in this battle, and he would resist until the last drop of his blood.

He charged forward with Empress Luan Xing, meeting the attacks of the six Eternal River Tier elites.

Just then, he and Empress Luan Xing had been able to pummel Yi Gaoning. However, six Eternal River Tier elites were far too powerful a formation. Moreover, each of their attacks was capable of shattering heaven and earth. If this weren’t the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, where the Saints had set up defensive formations everywhere, how could this small piece of land withstand their intense battle? It would have been obliterated long ago.

Ling Han unleashed heaven’s might, suppressing the power of the six elites by two stars. The six Eternal River Tier elites were astonished. This technique was far too frightening. Regardless of who Ling Han came across, he could suppress their power by two stars. In essence, Ling Han would gain an advantage of two stars. During battles between king tiers, such a technique was simply heaven-defying.

The battle was intense and brutal. Regardless of whether it was Ling Han, Empress Luan Xing, or the six Eternal River Tier elites, all of them were bloodied and riddled with wounds. It wouldn’t be surprising regardless of which side was defeated. After all, the battle prowess of the two sides was far too similar.

More and more senior disciples arrived, yet they were all stunned by what they saw.

Were those two... truly new disciples?

In any case, there were numerous Eternal River Tier elites among the newly arrived senior disciples. As long as a few of them joined the battle, Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing would certainly suffer defeat.

After all, their power was limited, and they didn’t have any other allies, either.

Sure enough, it wasn’t long before another Eternal River Tier elite joined the battle. Although he was only at the low extreme, he was adding danger to an already perilous situation. In fact, his participation was enough to affect the direction of the battle. Moreover, if one person joining wasn’t enough, they could always get two people, three people, or even four people to join!

The situation became more and more perilous for Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing.
