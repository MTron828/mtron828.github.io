3072 Fight for the Core

Only eight people were part of the team that traveled to the Profound Negative Realm.

There was Ling Han, Lin Luo, and the six other ultimate elites. Others wouldn’t be of any help even if they tagged along. Apart from Hysteria, their enemy was fully made up of Seventh Tier ultimate elites such as Chong Yan and the others.

These people were far too powerful. Nothing more needed to be said about Extermination, while Chong Yan and the others had obtained the dimensions that once belonged to Feng Wuding. This allowed their battle prowess to increase by a significant amount.

Someone with a battle prowess under the Seventh Tier participating in this battle would be nothing more than seeking death.

“Heh, sure enough, you people came!” Extermination remarked as she proudly stood in the sky. Gusts of energy blew past, causing her sleeves to billow in the air and her raven hair to flutter in the wind. This caused her skin to appear even whiter and more delicate.

She was a stunning beauty, yet she was also someone who could dictate the fate of the Genesis World of two separate eras.

“We’re not allowed to come?” Ling Han retorted calmly.

“It’s meaningless even if you do come,” Extermination replied in a similarly calm and nonchalant voice. It was as if she weren’t worried about Ling Han at all.

It was difficult to say whether this reflected her true feelings, but it at the very least gave her an advantage in terms of aura.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “And just who do you think you are? It’s meaningless just because you say so? We have to scurry back home just because you told us to?”

“Since you’ve already come, there’s no need to think about going home anymore. I’ll suppress all of you here today!” Extermination announced, with her raven hair fluttering in the wind. There was an indescribable beauty about her at this moment.

She looked at Ling Han, and continued in a baleful voice, “As for you… I’ll slowly grind away your cultivation before extracting all of your secrets!”

“Heh, in your dreams,” Ling Han snickered.

The core of the dimension had yet to appear, and the ultimate elites on both sides were also undying people who were unable to kill each other. Thus, they didn’t engage in battle right away. Instead, they threw insults at each other in an attempt to decrease their enemy’s morale.

Ling Han exchanged barbs with Extermination, while Lin Luo and the others exchanged barbs with Chong Yan and the other traitors.

“Ten Thousand Shadows, I’ll definitely slice open your chest to see what color your heart is!” Bai Fan shouted as he glowered at Ten Thousand Shadows. His face was filled with fury. He was a short-tempered person, and he detested ungrateful bastards like Ten Thousand Shadows the most.

Ten Thousand Shadows naturally paid no heed to this. He had already advanced to the Seventh Tier, so why would he still care about any of this? He simply needed to act as he pleased; he didn’t need to care about what others thought of him.

He was indestructible and undying, so what could they do about him?

“Bai Fan, once I obtain the core of the dimension and advance to the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, just see how I dispose of you!” he threatened calmly. Because of the length of time he had cultivated, his cultivation was indeed inferior to Bai Fan’s right now. However, this wouldn’t be the case once he advanced to the peak stage of the Seventh Tier.

Perhaps there would still be a small difference in power between different Heavenly Venerates at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. However, this difference definitely wouldn’t be very big.

The betrayal of Chong Yan and the others greatly angered Lin Luo and the other ultimate elites. Now that they were face to face again, their boiling anger naturally simmered to the fore.

Initially, Ling Han’s explosive increase in power had already allowed him to rival Hysteria and even push it back. In other words, he had already been powerful enough to eliminate the calamitous danger that Hysteria posed. Yet, the interference of Extermination as well as Chong Yan and the others had thrown a spanner in the works, and instead caused the situation to become even direr.

How could they not be furious?

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

Hysteria also appeared, brandishing its nine tentacles and causing immense pressure to descend upon Ling Han and the others.

The core of the dimension had yet to appear, yet everyone had already become tense and ready to explode at any moment.

Weng!

A column of brilliant light materialized, radiating with 18 different colors.

The core of the dimension had appeared.

Whoosh!

Hysteria was the first to move, with its tentacles shooting toward the core of the dimension. However, Ling Han immediately moved as well, throwing a punch and forcefully pushing Hysteria back.

Lin Luo, Chong Yan, and the others also started to move, giving rise to a chaotic battle.

“Ling Han, with me present, you won’t be able to achieve anything!” Extermination said as she dashed over. Her hands were like a heaven-splitting ax as they slashed down at Ling Han.

“Humph! Piss off!” Ling Han roared as he replied with a destructive punch.

Peng!

Extermination was immediately sent flying.

“What?!” Extermination exclaimed in shock. Ling Han’s power was actually growing even faster than hers? Even though the difference wasn’t big, he was indeed slightly more powerful than her now.

She sighed in her mind. She had transformed into the World’s Will before, and she had pretended to help Ling Han obtain two new abilities. In reality, however, she had been secretly stealing his secrets.

However, she had only learned how to elevate dimensions to the transcendent level, and she had failed to learn how to manifest new dimensions.

There were a total of 10,000 dimensions inside her, and this was already a remarkable and terrifying number. At that time, all of these dimensions had further been high-tier high-level dimensions, equivalent to the power of 100,000 Sixth Tier elites.

However, following the destruction of her previous body, all of these dimensions had suffered significant damage, with most of them directly collapsing. Meanwhile, the remaining ones were all severely damaged. This was also one of the main reasons why Hysteria had abandoned its old body and decided to start anew.

Even though Extermination was still domineering, there were only a few hundred dimensions remaining in her body. It was only because she had raised a few of them to the transcendent level that she was able to become so freakishly powerful.

However, it was far too difficult to raise dimensions to the transcendent level. Moreover, she hadn’t obtained as many secret codes of life as Ling Han, so this further caused the speed of her advance to slightly lag behind Ling Han’s.

Even though it was only by a tiny bit, this was still enough to give Ling Han an upper hand.

Ling Han unleashed a battle cry as he unleashed increasingly ferocious attacks.

“Myriad Transformations Return to One!” Extermination cried as she made a pushing motion with her jade-like palms. A chaotic burst of energy that was filled with disorder and turmoil attempted to refine the entire world into one.

Ling Han humphed coldly and unleashed a furious punch at her. Who cared what techniques she used? He would crush them with absolute power!

He was brimming with confidence and self-belief.

Peng!

Extermination was sent flying again. The difference in power between them was only minuscule, yet in a battle between ultimate elites, this minuscule difference was often extremely critical and decisive.

Hysteria charged over to join forces with Extermination and battle Ling Han.

Ling Han was unafraid, and he unleashed another battle cry as he faced off against the two most powerful enemies in the world. He appeared extremely lively as he fought against them.

Lin Luo and the others all watched on with emotion. Thank heavens they had resolutely defended Ling Han in the past. Otherwise, following Chong Yan and the others’ betrayal, they would be powerless to do anything but be suppressed. They wouldn’t have any hope of turning the tables.

The two sides continued to battle.

However, Hysteria and Extermination were both incredibly vicious beings who were only slightly weaker than Ling Han, so after joining forces, they slowly started to gain the upper hand. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After obtaining more dimensions, Chong Yan and the other traitors were also more powerful and Lin Luo and the others now.

Ling Han and his companions were suffering a full-scale disadvantage.

What could they do?

Ling Han bellowed and unleashed his full power as he charged at the core of the dimension.

Now wasn’t the time to engage in a life-or-death battle with Hysteria and the others. The core of the dimension was the most important thing.

However, Hysteria and Extermination naturally wouldn’t allow Ling Han to snatch the core of the dimension so easily. They both charged after him, unleashing a barrage of attacks as they did so.

The three supremely powerful beings continued to unleash furious attacks at each other as they fought for the core of the dimension.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Meanwhile, the core of the dimension continued to whiz around in the air. The Profound Negative Realm had yet to fully die, so it was as if the core of the dimension were a living person who was unwilling to be obtained by anyone.

Peng!

The three paragon elites exchanged another blow, unleashing a shock wave so powerful that the core of the dimension was instantly shattered into pieces.

Weng!

The shards of the core exploded in different directions.

Hysteria and Extermination attempted to grab them, yet Ling Han suddenly unleashed an explosive roar, after which boundless radiance started to shine from his body. His power increased by a whopping 8000-fold.

First-grade seals!
