Chapter 2037: Black ring

“Impossible!” Fu Yue immediately expressed disbelief. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

An Immortal Palace Tier-level decree had shown its might, so how could it be that it was not able to kill a mere Dividing Soul Tier? What kind of joke was that?

Meanwhile, Ling Han grinned as he countered, “Do you want to make a bet, then?”

“What kind of bet?” Fu Yue asked immediately.

“100,000,000 Star Stones.”

Fu Yue’s face involuntarily flushed. This made him recall the mishap that he had caused. He had not even gotten anything clarified yet, but had already asked someone to take 100,000,000 Star Stones as ransom for him.

“All right!” he immediately answered. Since someone was so determined to give him money, there naturally was no reason for him to refuse.

Only then did Ling Han slowly say, “This Ruan guy isn’t the main body, but just a divided soul of his.”

“Ah!” Fu Yue paused. “Are you sure?”

Pa, the back of his head immediately sustained a smack, and he heard Hu Niu angrily declare, “Niu’s Ling Han already said that is a divided soul, so he must be a fake! What, you want to renege on the bet?”

The Empress also showed a menacing expression. He dared to swindle the money of their Ling Clan?

Fu Yue couldn’t help but feel depressed. ‘Though I am not a sore loser, aren’t you guys committing daylight robbery here? Just because you say he’s a fake, he is? I can’t even doubt it?’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and pulled Fu Yue along with him as he walked forwards. “Pay careful attention.”

A divided soul was formed by extracting a sliver of the spirit from the main body, and the largest difference it had with the main body was in the amount of spirit it contained.

Fu Yue sensed earnestly, and after a while, he couldn’t help but curse as he said, “It is indeed a divided soul!” Though Ruan Dongxiang’s spirit had already shattered, it had happened quite recently, so it wasn’t very difficult for him to still be able to sense it vaguely.

“Thanks for the business, 100,000,000 Star Stones.” Ling Han extended a hand.

“Thanks, thanks!” Hu Niu copied him, extending her hand as well.

Xiao Gu was not willing to be left behind, either, impatiently stretching out his hand as well.

‘F***, is it really proper for you guys to do this?’

Fu Yue couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. These three people were all very strong, but why did they all look very undependable?

“Luckily, he did not die!” Meanwhile, Guo Ming breathed a sigh of relief. Though losing a divided soul was a major injury, as long as he had not died, anything could be earned back through cultivation. However, he was also slightly despondent. If Ruan Dongxiang had not died, then didn’t it mean that he and Liu Xueyan would still be hunted down?

“Am I the type to renege on a bet?” Fu Yue asked in displeasure. “Fine. Come with me to get the ransom money, oh, no, the betting stakes.”

Hearing him speak of ransom money, Ling Han and the others all burst into loud laughter. This guy was really quite amusing.

“Benefactor, please wait!” Guo Ming hurriedly said.

“En?” Ling Han turned to look at him.

“I am indebted to Benefactor for having rescued me twice. I do not have anything valuable on me, just an item that has been passed down for generations.” Guo Ming drew out a ring, and handed it over to Ling Han. “I am willing to gift it to Benefactor.”

“What is it?” Hu Niu asked curiously, and snatched this ring.

“I don’t know, either.” Guo Ming shook his head with a grimace. “It is said that my ancestor had obtained it unexpectedly. About several million years ago, my ancestor went into the mountains to cut firewood, and unexpectedly encountered two cultivators who were fighting each other to the death for the sake of an object.

“In the end, one of them won, but not too long after, he, too, died as his injuries were too severe.

“That treasure that they had been fighting over was thus brought back by my ancestor, and that is this ring. But even when my ancestor passed away, he still had not figured out what is so special about this ring.

“Generation after generation, the ancestors of the Guo Clan all wanted to know what was so precious about this ring, but without exception, their efforts had all come to nothing.

“When it was passed down to me, I, too, had studied it for a very long time, and had also flipped through a great many ancient scrolls in the Star Moon Sect, but still did not get any results.

“Though this could be completely useless, I still wish to gift it to Benefactor. Perhaps it would be of use in the hands of Benefactor.”

“Niu’s!” Hu Niu’s eyes narrowed in a glare as she said, “What is it? You want to snatch Niu’s belongings?” Now that it had fallen into her hands, it naturally was hers now.

Meanwhile, Fu Yue wanted to weep to the heavens. He clearly had helped out as well, but why was this married couple not even bothered to say a word of thanks to him? Furthermore, he had not called them into account for the matter of the Undying Pill yet, either.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel curious, and took this ring from Hu Niu’s hands. He placed it in the palm of his hand and surveyed it.

This ring was really plain. It was just a small black ring, without any adornments on it.

At first, Ling Han had thought this could be a Spatial treasure, but no matter how much he used his divine sense to touch it, it did not react in the slightest.

Then that shouldn’t be it.

He squeezed it hard, yet shockingly discovered that this thing was actually completely intact.

This was very surprising. Just how great was Ling Han’s strength by now?

In the case of Two-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, fingerprints would appear if he squeezed it hard, and even Three-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal would possibly slightly change shape.

But now, this ring was completely unscathed.

Should he use the Divine Demon Sword to deal with it?

This thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind and then vanished. He shook his head. What if this thing was really useful? It would be too much of a waste if it were to be swallowed by the Divine Demon Sword.

“I still want to try it out, though!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but summon the Divine Demon Sword. He would control it in the nick of time, and only wanted to give it a try.

He placed the ring on the blade of the Divine Demon Sword.?Weng, the Divine Demon Sword trembled slightly, but an incident that astonished Ling Han appeared.

The ring did not react at all!

This…!

Though the Divine Demon Sword was only a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool, it was previously already mentioned that Three Stars, Five Stars, 10 Stars, and so on were only human-made divisions. In terms of the essence of the Regulations of Metal, Divine Metal was the standard after Godly metal, and the concept of Pseudo-Divine Metal did not exist.

The so-called Pseudo-Divine Metal was forged having layer after layer of Level 20 Divine Metal fused together, and in terms of essence, it was still Level 20 Divine Metal.

Which also meant that there was not the slightest bit of difference in difficulty for the Divine Demon Sword to swallow a One-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal and 10-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. However, because the 10-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal had more Divine Metal fused within it, the sword would need a longer time to swallow it.

If the ring could not be swallowed by the Divine Demon Sword, there were only two possibilities.

Firstly, this was not metal at all, so the Divine Demon Sword naturally could do nothing against it.

However, Ling Han was sure that this was definitely metal, genuine and no deception about it, because he possessed a Metal Element Source Power of heaven and earth. If he still could not distinguish whether this was metal or not, then he might as well just jump into a river and commit suicide.

But since it was metal, yet could not be swallowed, then it would have to be the second possibility.

…This was Divine Metal!

Strictly speaking, the Divine Demon Sword was still a God Tool now, and also Godly metal. The name of Pseudo-Celestial Tool was only the label that was attached by the people of the Celestial Realm. Since that was the case, how could Godly metal possibly be able to swallow Divine Metal?

Wouldn’t it be stuffed until it burst?

Thus, the Divine Demon Sword did not react in the slightest, and the ring was also completely unmoved.

Divine Metal!

Ling Han couldn’t help but jump madly in his heart. Was this the precious Tool of a Celestial King? No wonder people had fought to death over it, and had even killed each other. This kind of precious treasure was indeed incredibly tempting to others.

He did not tell Guo Ming about his deduction. Firstly, the strength of these two people was too low. If they were really to find out that he had possession of a Celestial King Tier treasure, it would not be a good thing for them. Instead, it could possibly draw a fatal calamity onto their heads if they had a slip of the tongue.

Secondly, they had not been able to figure out the use of this ring throughout these several million years, so it would be a waste even if it stayed in their possession.

Ling Han took out some alchemical pills, and stuffed them into Guo Ming’s hands. Smiling, he said, “What use this ring has, I am not sure either for the moment. However, I am sure that this is indeed a treasure.”

“No, no, no. Benefactor, you have already saved us twice, so how could we still accept gifts from you?” Guo Ming and his wife declined.
