Chapter 2367: Clashing with a Heavenly Venerate

Ling Han did not linger in battle. He merely casually shot out a punch, and Huai Jian and the others instantly exploded like flowers being scattered. Under his might, they could not even last a single blow.

Most people directly exploded into flesh and blood, but Huai Jian and Jing Zhongyue were spared. A light flickered on them, and it blocked the attack from Ling Han.

‘The power of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity,’ Ling Han thought immediately. That elite was really prejudiced, having given additional help and care to Huai Jian and Jing Zhongyue.

He did not follow up with another blow, but rather shot forwards onto the mountain.

With his speed, he instantly threw Jing Zhongyue and Huai Jian off his tail, charging into the mountains.

Ancestral King Zhi Kong immediately awoke. He had sensed a terrifying killing intent had already locked down on him, but he had just opened his eyes when a cold flash had already struck down on him, splitting him in two.

Pa, the left and right side of his body slipped down to the sides, and he died just like that.

Hong long long, lightning flashed in the skies, turning into multiple giants that descended, launching a barrage of blasts at Ling Han, and the heaven and earth grieved as well, lamenting the death of an Ancestral King.

Ling Han took a deep breath, and concentrated his power entirely on the Divine Demon Sword. The frightening power of Heavenly Venerable Tier caused even the blade to tremble, as if it could shatter at any moment. He shouted loudly, and delivered a sword strike.

Peng!

The whole Divine Desolate Mountain shuddered strongly, dust and dirt flying, and turning into a massive mushroom cloud, and if one could come into the center of the mountains, they would see that the whole mountain peak had been leveled.

Weng, a frightening divine sense spread out, filled with age and experience. It was like a wild beast that had gone through endless years had awoken, filled with fury, and planning to destroy the heavens and earth.

Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity!

The commotion was too great, awakening him from his secluded state. As he had been refining the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le all these epochs, this disturbance had incredibly strong effects on him. Thus, he was incredibly furious.

Who would dare to disturb him?

“You!!” The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity stretched out a hand, and the dust and dirt that filled the skies were instantly swept aside. He stood proudly like the overlord of a realm, exuding an aura that even the heaven and earth seemed to be trembling at.

Ling Han understood. It was not the heaven and earth that was fearing him, but rather Regulations.

His Vitality Index was close to 16,000 points. This guy’s strength was already so high that it was close to the level of Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“A mere piece of trash of the human race, just because you have a mighty precious Tool, you dare to commit insolence in front of me!” Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity smirked coldly.?Boom, the power of heaven and earth rippled. Regulations were not allowed to exist at all, and split apart consequently.

This blow could destroy worlds.

Ling Han roared loudly, and faced it with his full efforts.

Peng!

WIth this blow, he was directly sent flying tens of thousands of miles away. The gap between them was too wide. How could a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate face a real Heavenly Venerate, what more when the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was one of the strongest on this level at that? Perhaps he was even the strongest Heavenly Venerate.

But Ling Han charged back without the slightest hesitation. The Divine Demon Sword danced, unafraid of even a Heavenly Venerate.

“You are courting death!!” The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was outraged, and once more stretched out his hand to strike Ling Han down.

Peng, peng, peng,?with every strike, Ling Han was undoubtedly sent flying. The gap in strength between them was really too wide, but he would immediately charge back every time like he was a monster that could not be killed.

Finally, Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was truly angered. He had left behind a portion of his power to suppress the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le all this while, and that was why he had not been able to unleash his true power, but now he could not accept that he had not been able to kill a mere minor character in Ninth Lotus after such a long time.

Boom, he sent out another palm strike, and his might instantly soared 100 or even 1000 times over, terrifying to the extreme.

This time, he was truly attacking with his full power. Even the heaven and earth would be wary of such strong power, and a part of the heavenly tribulation instantly blasted at the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He was too powerful, and could not exist in this realm.

Peng, without the slightest doubt, Ling Han exploded into a shower of blood.

Then, a flame ignited. He was presently reforming, and healing himself rapidly.

Rising From The Ashes!

Initially, Ling Han could not use Rising From The Ashes after entering the Foreign Realm, because Regulations differed, but the Black Tower was showing its might this time, which was equivalent to having created a small realm of the Celestial Realm. In this zone, Ling Han could use all the Regulations of the Celestial Realm.

“Overestimating yourself!” the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity smirked coldly. So what if you rose from the ashes again? He only had to follow up with another strike, and could still send Ling Han on to his next life.

Boom, he struck out with a palm, not giving Ling Han any chance to resurrect himself.

Peng!

Right at this crucial moment, his palm was actually blocked.

‘What?!’

Even Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity revealed an expression of disbelief. This was something that he had completely failed to predict.

“Hahahaha, Desolate Eternity, never thought that I would still be able to battle, right?” The laughter of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le rang out. His figure had appeared as well, turning into the image of a middle-aged man in his thirties. He was handsome, generous, and incomparable in his charisma.

“So… this brat wanted to draw me into attacking with full power so as to create a chance for you to escape!” Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity immediately understood. Instantly, flames were gushing from his nostrils, stronger than even the origin flame of the heaven and earth.

He was almost dying from fury. Now that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had escaped, it meant that his efforts for the last over dozen epochs would be wasted.

“That’s right!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le declared proudly, his eyes sweeping over Ling Han, and holding a hint of gentleness. This was the doting love an elder felt for a junior.

“So what about it? I managed to suppress you once, so I will definitely be able to suppress you a second time, or a third time!” Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity smirked coldly, but though his words were confident, all his efforts had come to naught this time, and who knew how many more epochs he would have to go through to finally refine the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le.

Naturally, he was furious to the extreme at this.

“Desolate Eternity, we will fight again next time.” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed loudly, and stretched out a hand, grabbing the newly revived Ling Han. Then, taking a step, he was instantly millions and millions of miles away. Furthermore, before he left, he did not forget to deliver a last attack, filled with the fury that had accumulated from him almost being refined.

Boom!

Heavenly Venerate Divine Desolate Mountain had no choice but to parry this attack, but merely the rippling of several slivers of power almost razed the whole Divine Desolate Mountain into the ground, and who knew how many people had become a mush of blood and flesh.

This was the strike of a Heavenly Venerate, the power that surpassed Regulations!

“Damn it!!” Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity roared in fury, and set off in hot pursuit of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. He was determined to capture both Heavenly Venerate Wu Le and Ling Han, and subject them to the cruelest of punishments.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le did not linger in battle at all, and directly aimed for the connecting point of the two realms.

With how fast the speed of a Heavenly Venerate was, they could appear at any corner with a mere thought. Though this was only the manifestation of divine sense, which was faster than their physical body, in truth, their physical speed was not much worse, either.

In merely half an hour, the connecting point of the two realms was already within sight.

In this place, the storm of energy had taken the form of a colossal waterfall that descended from the heavens, preventing anyone from leaving or entering. Even a Heavenly Venerate would be severely wounded should they attempt to barge in by force, and added with how they would be targeted by the heaven and earth, there was a 99% chance that they would die.

Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was already close to approaching. He couldn’t help but smirk coldly. Could it be that they had come here planning to barge into the storm of energy?

“Desolate Eternity, no need for the send-off. Your life will be up to this brat to take in future!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed loudly, charging over into the energy storm without the slightest hesitation.

“No!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le screamed in fury. Though his strength had greatly improved in these more than dozen epochs, he had still not reached the pinnacle of the First Tier Heavenly Venerate. As he saw it, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was actually a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier Great Herb for him.

He stretched out his hand to grab him, gushing with his full power. The ground in the surrounding area stretching as far as hundreds of thousands of miles was completely destroyed. Who knew how many beings of the Foreign Realm had been implicated and died.
