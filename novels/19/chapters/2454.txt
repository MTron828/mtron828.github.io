“Hand over the blood essence to me.” A sliver of divine sense from Hui took human form, and appeared at the cave entrance.

Ling Han looked towards the distance. An expansive mainland appeared ahead of them. They had indeed arrived near the coast. Ling Han smiled slightly, yet shook his head. “We have to reach the coast first.”

Hui was displeased. “I have already fulfilled your conditions. Could it be that you don’t think that you should show some of your sincerity?”

“As long as we are in this massive ocean, you would have an advantage. In the first place, our agreement is not between equals,” Ling Han said. “With how strong you are, even if we are on land, you are close to being invincible, so why should you be so concerned?”

Hui humphed. In terms of genuine strength, even if they all joined forces, they would not be a match for him. This was because he had absolutely not revealed any of his weaknesses. Ling Han and the others could not truly cause him any serious injury. At most, they could only slice off a few of his roots, and this was practically just an itch to him.

“You people had best not have other ideas, or I will definitely not be so nice!”

“Fine, fine, fine.” Ling Han nodded casually.

Hui ferried them to the beach, and Ling Han and the others hurriedly jumped onto the beach. Instantly, their hearts calmed.

With their feet on solid ground, their battle prowess finally could be unleashed to pinnacle level, and throughout these four months, they had naturally expelled the insect poison completely as well, returning to their prime condition.

“Blood essence!” Hui demanded.

...

Ling Han nodded, and was the first to stretch out his right hand. Stimulated with force, the tip of his finger glowed. Then, with a slice of the Divine Demon Sword, a drop of blood shining with an unusual glimmer appeared.

Da, da, da. He bled out 10 drops of blood in total, and they were contained in a jade bottle.

This was blood essence. Even if he only had to give up 10 drops, it still had serious effects on Ling Han, causing his expression to become very ugly. Thankfully, with his amazing Body Art, it would also be very fast for him to recover his blood essence.

Huo Furong and the others also cut their wrists to let out some blood. They all gave up 10 drops. Blood essence was too valuable, so it naturally could only be given out in drops.

Hui glanced them over, and said, “I’m still missing a bit more.” This was just barely enough for him, but it was not assured.

Ling Han asked, “How much more do you need?”

“At least another 20 drops!” Hui was not reserved either.

Ling Han looked towards Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong, “You guys let out some more blood.”

The both of them were immediately outraged. “Why does it have to be us?”

“That’s right. There are 10 of us, so it would be fine if each of us just gives out another one or two drops.”

...Bewitching Maiden Rou was not a Monarch Star, so even if she requested to surrender some of her own blood of her own volition, Hui would not take it, either. It was of no use to him.

Ling Han tossed them a glare. “I told you to let out some blood, so just do as I say. Why are you two spouting so much nonsense? Why don’t you guys ask yourselves what you have done? Now I’m just telling you to let out some blood, and you’re so noisy about it.”

“No!” Both of them shook their heads.

Ling Han moved. Boom, with battle prowess and power of Regulation surging at the same time, his battle prowess leaped past the line of Celestial King Tier all at once as he suppressed both Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong.

“Damn it!”

The two of them hurriedly entered into Heaven Forbidden State, and began clashing with Ling Han.

Unfortunately, even if they had entered into this state, it only allowed their Vitality Index to be extremely close to the Celestial King Tier, and while using celestial techniques further would indeed possibly push their battle prowess past the line of Celestial King Tier, it was still slightly inferior compared with Ling Han.

The result was that they were still only beaten into continuous retreat by Ling Han even when the two of them joined forces.

In just 100 moves, Ling Han suppressed the both of them. He held the Divine Demon Sword at their necks, forcing them to surrender their blood essence.

There was naturally no way that Ji Wuming would help them, and Huo Furong acted as if she had seen nothing. Who could stop Ling Han?

Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong could only force out another few drops of blood essence, but they were both only willing to surrender five drops. Otherwise, they would rather choose to directly break through to the Celestial King Tier.

...If they lost too much blood essence, their battle prowess would drop greatly, and they would definitely be unable to obtain the perfect Celestial Seed at the end.

Since that was the case, what need was there for them to accept a compromise?

“I only have so much.” Ling Han tossed the two jade bottles over to Hui.

Actually, the blood essence from before was barely enough for his use. Hence, after Hui took the jade bottles, he nodded, and did not push them any further.

“Then, we will take our leave!” Ling Han said.

Hui’s figure trembled, and disappeared from sight. This was only a sliver of his divine sense.

However, soon after, waves rose up in the ocean, as countless water vines shot up into the skies, creating extremely terrifying tsunami waves that were thousands of meters tall.

Everyone showed hints of alert in their expression. Was Hui going to become hostile?

Boom, the ocean waves split apart, and an astonishingly massive island rose up in the ocean.

However, after the island rose up thousands of meters, they could see countless water vines beneath it, intertwined tightly together.

This was Hui’s real body!

“Looks like... a carrot,” Ling Han muttered. It really looked like a carrot, just that it was countless times much larger.

“No meat, not delicious.” Hu Niu said with a yawn. Losing 10 drops of blood essence made her feel very weary.

Xiu, this “giant carrot” released a blurry light that wrapped around it entirely. Then, suddenly, the light dazzled brilliantly, causing their vision to blur.

Was he going to attack?

Everyone stayed on the alert, but when the light dimmed, a person appeared in front of them.

It was still Hui.

What was he playing at?

Yet Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. “You actually can take on human form already!”

The human Hui from before was only a sliver of divine sense, but now his real body had taken human form. The significance was completely different.

If the present Hui was killed, he really would die.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel keen. If they could kill such a Celestial Herb that had gained intelligence and ascended Dao, just how much amazing profit would they be able to gain?

Hui humphed, and spread open his right hand. Multiple water vines appeared, densely intertwined in an extremely exaggerated manner.

Everyone immediately dismissed the thought of attacking. Though he had taken human form, Hui’s strength was still terrifying.

“What is it? You want to accompany us further?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“I, too, want a flawless Celestial Seed,” Hui declared darkly.

“F***, you yourself are a Celestial Seed, so what do you want it for?” Ling Han exclaimed exaggeratedly.

Hui humphed. “Then you guys also have Celestial Seeds in your bodies, so why do you still desire a flawless Celestial Seed?”

This was quite logical, and rendered everyone speechless.

Still, a Celestial Herb that should be supplying Celestial Seeds actually wanted to contend with them over Celestial Seeds. No matter how they thought about it, it was rather strange.

“Then, we will use our respective powers, and depend on our own luck respectively,” Huo Furong said coldly. Just think, she was known as the number one celestial maiden in the eras, yet she had actually been tricked by a herb, and almost died, which made her very furious.

However, her disadvantage lay in the fact that she had not broken through the barrier to the Celestial King Tier. Once she set foot into this threshold, her battle prowess would be incredibly powerful.

This revenge would definitely be exacted.

Xiu, her figure rose, and she was the first to leave.

Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong were also looking at Ling Han venomously. They would remember the humiliation that they had suffered. Once they became Celestial Kings, they would definitely seek Ling Han out and get their revenge.

Ling Han scoffed, and demanded coldly, “What are you two looking at?”

The two of them did not refute him. Instead, they turned and left. At present, all of them could break through to the Celestial King Tier, which meant that they had grasp of a very powerful trump card. Every single one of them were secure, knowing that they had backing.

Ji Wuming also left gracefully, and did not bring along his intergenerational disciple. Shi Chanzi, however, left with Jia Lan. Who knew if some relation surpassing friendship had occurred between the two of them.

“Fourth Brother, we will also move separately,” the Rain Emperor said.

“Sure,” Ling Han said with a nod.

The team of 11 immediately split up, and once more only Ling Han and his group was left, along with the addition of Hui.
