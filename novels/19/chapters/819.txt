Ling Han gave it some consideration, and accepted the Lunar King’s invitation to head to the middle state.

There would not be much use for him to stay here anyways, as there were absolutely no hostile elites here that needed him to step out. And in the case of the Sea Race, Helian Tianyun could practically cope with all of them. Then, there were only the five sects of the middle state that had to be dealt with.

This was the most important priority. Without eliminating the five sects, what use was there to talk of splitting open the skies?

After Ling Han made some arrangements, he prepared to set out.

Helian Xun Xue was definitely going to stay behind to handle national affairs. Thus, Ling Han only brought Zhu Xuan Er, Hu Niu, Rabbit, and Gold-Seeking Rat with him. With Yi Shuang Shuang overseeing things, he was not afraid that someone would ransack his lair.

“Kakaka, where is Ling Han!” They had yet to depart when they heard a sinister, spooky laughter ring out. A mysterious person hidden completely under a cloak appeared above the Imperial Capital.

Ling Han could not help but wear a strange expression, and said, “What’s going on here? Shattering Void Tier is a bit too cheap, isn’t it? Why do they appear so often here?”

This mysterious person was definitely in the Shattering Void Tier. The aura exuded by them was incredibly astonishing, forcefully ripping through the air.

Ling Han soared up into the air, looked at the mysterious person for a while, then suddenly exclaimed, “You are the Asura Demon Emperor!”

“Kakaka, brat, your eyes are not that bad!” The mysterious man flipped open his cloak, revealing a tall, sturdy man. He had regular features, with a beard as sharp as a steel needle.

The Asura Demon Emperor did not have a physical body. Whichever person his Demonic Qi enshrouded, he would become that person. Thus, there was no way to kill him. That was why he had been split into nine parts and suppressed separately.

However, the current Asura Demon Emperor was really strong. Merely looking at him, Ling Han felt pain as if his eyes were about to crack.

Fifteen Stars of the Shattering Void Tier?

F***, the ultimate elites in today’s world were all cheap, weren’t they? Appearing one after another!

Years ago, the Lunar King and her seven companions were enough to sweep aside all opposition in the world, which was proof that fifteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier was the topmost tier of this world. Yet now, there had already appeared a number of people with fifteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier.

Aside from the Eight Kings, there were still the Fifteen-eyed Corpse King, the giant silver spider, and Yi Shuang Shuang at least. And now, there was an Asura Demon Emperor.

“You’re retrieved all your nine parts?” Ling Han guessed. It was practically impossible for the Asura Demon Emperor to have battle prowess exceeding fifteen Stars when he was intact. If he had had it, how would he have been defeated and split into nine parts?

“Kaka, that’s right!” The Asura Demon Emperor stared fixedly at Ling Han, his eyes filled with extreme fury.

Each of the nine parts existed individually, but after merging, all their memories would be combined and belong to one person. To him, this human was extremely detestable. At the time, he tricked him into possessing a Chaos Source Rock that was practically ready to be scrapped, almost condemning him to eternal damnation.

Thankfully, the nine parts could meld into each other. He had been found by his other parts, swallowed, and only then did he manage to break out of the Chaos Source Rock. Otherwise, his maximum ability would only be in the Flower Blossom Tier.

“Hand over the Chaos Source Rock!” he commanded harshly.

For an existence like him, the Chaos Source Rock was the best vessel, as well as the biggest opportunity. It was more precious than any amazing alchemical pill or any ultimate cultivation technique.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “Sorry, but it’s long gone. Why don’t I just give you some random rock? Don’t be disdainful; after all, what rock is not a rock?”

“You still dare to act stubborn!” The Asura Demon Emperor humphed. He absolutely did not believe that Ling Han was capable of refining the Chaos Source Rock in such a short period of time. This was an absolutely impossible thing to happen. It was impossible to accomplish even in a few millennia, what more when only a few years had passed. That was not a treasure that could be used by a mortal.

“You’re not handing it over?” He laughed weirdly. “That’s all right. I merely need to possess your body, and your everything would belong to me!”

Possession, for him, was a piece of cake; his original form was a stream of Demonic Qi.

Ling Han became serious internally. His physique could withstand any blow from the Shattering Void Tier, but what about his soul? This Asura Demon Emperor posed a huge threat to him.

“Obediently deliver all you have to me!” The Asura Demon Emperor stretched out a hand, grabbing out in Ling Han’s direction.

Peng! Peng!

Right at this moment, two beautiful fists shot out at the same time, simultaneously landing on the Asura Demon Emperor’s face. A terrifying force exploded, instantly sending the Asura Demon Emperor flying.

The Asura Demon Emperor regained his footing. His whole face had completely caved in, and the back of his head was protruding slightly, looking incredibly strange. If this had been another person, he would definitely have died. However, the Asura Demon Emperor merely stretched out a hand and smacked the back of his head. Pa , the caved in face immediately bounced back out. Only his features had been misshapen due to the compression, looking very weird.

This was so disgusting it would make one vomit. Yet, the Asura Demon Emperor completely did not take it to heart. Instead, he gave out a cold aura, and said, “I never thought that there would be two powerful beings here that are not inferior to me.”

“If you know what’s good for you, get lost quickly!” the Lunar King said lazily.

“Kakaka, if you want to chase me away, you would have to have that kind of ability!” The Asura Demon Emperor licked his lips. “I have never possessed the body of a woman before, and I suddenly feel very interested in doing so!”

The Lunar King’s beautiful face instantly froze over. She said, “You actually dare to have designs on me? You’re really looking for death!” She immediately charged out, beginning a series of berserk attacks on the Asura Demon Emperor.

Previously, the Asura Demon Emperor had been suddenly beaten by the two women. Aside from that, he had also been careless as he had never imagined that the tiny Great Ling Empire would actually have two elite cultivators of the Shattering Void Tier standing by here.

Of course, more importantly, his original form was Demonic Qi, so he absolutely would not care whether his vessel would be wounded or damaged... he could just switch to another body, right?

“You have quite a good body, I am definitely claiming it!” The Asura Demon Emperor cackled as he continued to parry the Lunar King’s barrage of attacks.

“Eight Lunar Techniques!” The Lunar King used her ultimate move, her whole head of black locks dancing wildly. A divine saber took form behind her, slashing towards the Asura Demon Emperor. Xiu , after a single slash, another divine saber formed, and continued to slash again.

“Ah!” the Asura Demon Emperor exclaimed in shock. “You have actually formed power of regulation!”

It was as if he had had some unfathomable experience, his tone filled with terror.

“Heng, you evil thing from the Netherworld, the thing you fear the most would be the restriction of the realm, and the power of regulation is given form by the powers of the realm. It is the perfect thing to suppress you.” The Lunar King delivered unceasing blows.

The Asura Demon Emperor grunted endlessly. His cultivation level far exceeded the Shattering Void Tier, and so he had naturally formed power of regulation as well, but his power of regulation had been cultivated in the Netherworld, and completely could not fit into this realm.

His power was very strong, but without the support from the world, how could he stand against the power of regulation of this realm?

“Damn it! Damn it!” The Asura Demon Emperor was repeatedly forced into retreat with the barrage of blows. Fighting with the Lunar King was equivalent to him being suppressed by the powers of the realm. This was too great a disadvantage to him. After a few more rounds, he finally gave up the battle, turned around, and left.

“Brat, unless you are planning to hide beside these two women forever, I will definitely occupy your body, and take over everything you own!” He tossed out a line that fitted the situation.

Ling Han sneered coldly. When he broke through to the Shattering Void Tier, he would use his Sword Heart Illumination and kill this great demon!
