Chapter 1470 Great Misfortune

Yi Gaoning decided to ignore Ling Han. He didn’t have any confidence in going against him, so it was definitely best to seek out some reinforcements.

He turned around to leave. However, just as he raised his foot, he felt a terrifying killing intent lock onto him. This killing intent would mercilessly slash over if he dared to take a step, killing and leaving him with no proper burial.

This was only a feeling. However, elites like him held immense trust in their senses and intuition.

If he took a step, he would trigger a wild and unrelenting barrage of attacks from Ling Han.

However, Yi Gaoning found this a little strange. This was because there was something slightly different about this killing intent.

He turned around extremely slowly, afraid that any quick movements would cause his opponent to mercilessly attack. When he finally managed to fully turn around, Yi Gaoning was astonished to discover that the killing intent that had locked onto him wasn’t from Ling Han!

Rather, it was from the woman who had a white veil covering her face. Her figure was stunning, and she radiated with an aura of nobility and dominance. It was as if she were an empress!

Yi Gaoning was completely stunned. This killing intent was terrifying, so much so that even he was feeling apprehensive. From this, it could be seen that this woman definitely possessed a devastating power. However, this woman was only at the Heavenly Body Tier!

This was another supreme king tier at the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Otherwise, there was no way she could have exuded such an overwhelming and terrifying aura.

Yi Gaoning was about to go crazy!

This was the f*cking eighth campus, where everyone specialized in practicing formations! So, why had two supreme king tiers decided to come here?

There was a menacing glint in Empress Luan Xing’s eyes. This person actually wanted her and Ling Han to crawl through the dog flap? With her proud and haughty personality, how could she not be enraged?

“I’m going to dice you into 10,000 pieces and feed you to the wild dogs!” the empress said in rage.

However, her charm was far too great. Even though she had uttered such a menacing threat, not a single person felt hostility toward her. Instead, they felt that she was extremely domineering.

“Young lady, I don’t eat meat,” the large black dog said as he suddenly appeared from out of nowhere. “Don’t slander Grandpa Dog!”

Ling Han chuckled upon hearing this. This depraved dog didn’t eat meat? Who the f*ck would believe this?!

If he came across a supremely valuable medicine, perhaps he would be “vegetarian” for that short period of time. However, during other times, he would definitely be a dog who didn’t care what he ingested, whether it was meat or otherwise.

Regarding the large black dog mysteriously appearing and disappearing, Ling Han didn’t find this especially strange.

“Either crawl through the dog flap or get pummeled by me. It’s your choice!” Ling Han rolled up his sleeves, and it was as if he were going to team up with Empress Luan Xing to punish Yi Gaoning.

“Dog... Dog flap?” the large black dog asked as he jumped over. Upon seeing the dog flap beside the gate, he couldn’t help but feel enraged, shouting, “You brats actually dare to insult me? Grandpa Dog is going to bite you people to death!”

He dashed over and ferociously bit at Yi Gaoning’s bottom.

The pitiful Yi Gaoning didn’t dare to move at all. Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing had already locked onto his aura, so if he dared to move, he would definitely have to face devastating attacks from them. He didn’t dare to take this risk

In his mind, there was nothing special about this large black dog. It was just slightly strange in that it was actually wearing a pair of iron underwear. This dog was nothing but a joke.

Thus, he simply channeled his Origin Power, forming a protective barrier around his body.

Ling Han sighed upon seeing this. Although the large black dog was extremely depraved, those who dared to underestimate him would all face misfortune—great misfortune! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Weng!

The large black dog mysteriously broke through Yi Gaoning’s protective barrier. With a snarl, he then viciously bit down on Yi Gaoning’s bottom.

“Aaah...!” Yi Gaoning’s entire body arched back as severe pain shot through his body. He had no time to worry about his movements being too large and thereby triggering attacks from Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing, either. Through howls of agony, he hurriedly moved his hands down to protect his bottom.

“You actually dared to insult me? See how I bite your bottom into three cheeks!” The large black dog continued to ferociously bite at Yi Gaoning’s bottom. There were loud tearing sounds, and blood started to flow from his mouth.

“Let go! Hurry up and let go!” Yi Gaoning shouted through gritted teeth. There were no bones in one’s bottom, so this brutal bite truly sent waves of heart-wrenching pain through his body.

Yi Gaoning genuinely couldn’t endure this any longer, so he stood up and started to run, hoping to shake the large black dog off. However, the large black dog was extremely tenacious when it came to things like this. He wouldn’t let go no matter what, and it was as if he were determined to bite a piece of Yi Gaoning’s flesh off.

Moreover, he continued to add insult to the injury, saying, “Ugly man, why is your bottom so stinky? How many days haven’t you bathed for? Pei, pei, pei! It’s Grandpa Dog’s great misfortune to have come across a sh*tty person such as you!”

Yi Gaoning almost vomited blood upon hearing this. It was him who was suffering great misfortune, okay?! His bottom was actually being bitten by a rabid dog!

Everyone was stunned speechless by this incredibly strange sight. An Eternal River Tier elite was actually having his bottom bitten by a large black dog? And this large black dog was actually wearing a pair of iron underwear? This sight was as strange as could be.

“C*nt dog, I’m going to kill you!” Yi Gaoning couldn’t shake the large black dog off, so he had no choice but to attack. His bones started to glow. In fact, there were formation patterns inscribed on his bones, meaning that each of his bones was a formation eye in itself. Moreover, the higher his cultivation level, the higher the level of formation patterns that he could inscribe on his bones. The higher the level of these formation patterns, the more mighty they would naturally be.

Countless golden sabers slashed toward the large black dog, yearning to dice him into mincemeat.

However, the large black dog’s physique was surprisingly powerful, with the golden sabers unable to hurt him a single bit. In fact, they couldn’t even cut off a single strand of his hair.

The large black dog was extremely smug as he continued to bite onto Yi Gaoning’s bottom. Surprisingly, however, he still had the ability to speak, saying, “Trying to hurt your Grandpa Dog? You’re far too weak! Foolish human, obediently become my stead!”

Yi Gaoning was beside himself with rage. He could accept defeat, but asking him to become the stead of this large black dog? If he truly became one, he would genuinely have no more face in the future.

“F*ck this, I’m going to kill you!” he roared. He angrily gritted his teeth, causing a mouthful of blood to shoot out from his mouth. At the same time, 30% of his hair instantly turned grayish-white. However, his aura rose explosively, reaching the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

Peng!

He launched a palm, striking at the large black dog’s body. The might of this strike was far too great, and the large black dog was instantly sent flying. However, there was a loud tearing sound as a large chunk of Yi Gaoning’s bottom was brutally torn off.

There was a massive hole in his pants, and his white bottom was clear for the world to see. However, there was a large chunk of it missing. Blood flowed freely, dying his pants a crimson red. Because there was a large chunk of flesh missing from his left bum cheek, it now looked like it was two cheeks. Add to that his right bum cheek, and sure enough, he now had three bum cheeks just as the large black dog had promised.

“Aaah...!” However, it was the large black dog who started unleash deafening screams of agony. “Murder! Murder! The pain is killing Grandpa Dog! Hurry, someone come and help me! There’s a madman indiscriminately beating people!”

‘This...!’

Everyone grimaced upon seeing this. In fact, even Ling Han started to feel some slight sympathy for Yi Gaoning.

There wasn’t a single wound on the large black dog’s body, while Yi Gaoning had suffered a devastating wound to his bottom. Was it not clear who had suffered more? However, this despicable dog was actually screaming before Yi Gaoning even opened his mouth. Moreover, his screams were deafening and earth-shattering. If they hadn’t witnessed the events with their very own eyes, they would have definitely thought that Yi Gaoning had done something unspeakable to the despicable large black dog.

This caused Yi Gaoning to forget his pain. He was dazed as he stared at the large black dog, and he felt that of the countless shameless people that he had come across in his lifetime, none of them could even come close to comparing to this large black dog. They were like his grandsons when it came to shamelessness.

Some cleverer senior disciple had already turned around to flee. Since Yi Gaoning wasn’t able to break free, it was probably best that he run away to call for reinforcements. There were freakish talents among the new disciples, and... there was also a despicable yet powerful large black dog.

However, before he could even leave, he saw a large hand descending from the sky, forcefully suppressing him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I can allow you to leave, but through this door please!” He pointed at the dog flap.

Since this was how they had treated him, he was simply returning the favor now.
