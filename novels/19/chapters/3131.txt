3132 Another World

Ling Han ran as fast as he could. The terrain of this mine was complicated, and it wouldn’t take long for crossroads to appear. This could greatly reduce the threat of Li Changdan throwing rocks, but he was still impossible to be disregarded.

Ling Han gritted his teeth and ran back to where he had come from.

It wasn’t long before darkness appeared before them. It was profound and unfathomable.

Ling Han didn’t hesitate at all, immediately throwing himself into the darkness.

Li Changdan frowned. In such a dark environment, he could only throw rocks randomly. Moreover, what if he was ambushed?

He couldn’t detect anything at all.

However, he also made up his mind in an instant, and his speed did not slow down in the slightest.

It didn’t matter. Ling Han was in front of him, and if there really were any vicious creatures sneaking up on them, they would attack Ling Han first, just like he was a trailblazer.

“Junior Brother Ling, why are you running so fast? Let’s have a good chat,” he said calmly, feeling that everything was under his control.

Ling Han sneered, and said, “Hypocrite, have you forgotten that you were thrashed to tears by me? And yet, you still have the audacity to act arrogant in front of me!”

Li Changdan’s expression changed drastically upon hearing this.

Fighting with Ling Han in the Ancient Formation was his most humiliating experience. He had been kicked in the nuts twice, and when he returned and underwent an examination, the doctor said that even one of them had cracked!

This was also another reason why the He Clan had called off the wedding. There was no guarantee that they could even have a descendant. What was the use of having such a son-in-law?

All of this was because of Ling Han!

“You b@stard, when you fall into my hands, I won’t kill you so easily. Instead, I’ll skin you first,” Li Changdan said balefully. “But don’t worry. You won’t die. I’ll give you a treasured medicine to keep you hanging onto life so that you can see and feel all of this with your own eyes.”

“Then, I’ll shatter every single bone in your body, and finally, I’ll slice you off bit by bit, right until you breathe your last!”

Ling Han smirked coldly. Hidden underneath the hypocrisy of this modest gentleman, was an almost depraved soul.

He didn’t say anything further, and just kept running.

This passage was very long, and there was no place to turn. Otherwise, in such a pitch-black environment, even if there was a wall in front of him, Ling Han would not have been able to stop himself in time.

After running for more than two hours, Ling Han felt all the blood in his body boil. He felt extremely terrible, and it was as if his legs were about to explode.

After running at an extremely high speed for so long, his body had already reached its limit.

There was an exit?

This small bright spot was getting bigger and bigger. It was indeed an exit.

For a while, Ling Han had no time to think about the fact that he was running in an underground tunnel, yet a strange exit had appeared.

A change of scenery was definitely a good thing. It would be best if there was a great river or something outside the exit, allowing him to escape the pursuit of Li Changdan.

After a few more minutes, the exit was already within sight.

“Don’t even think about it!” Li Changdan was already closing in.

Previously, because the environment was too dark, he had been afraid that there would be an ambush here, so he had not been running at full speed, but now that the exit was right in front of him, he was also afraid that there would be changes to the current situation. Thus, he burst out with speed.

Xiu, he had already closed in on Ling Han. Stretching out his right hand, he formed it into a claw, and reached out to grab at Ling Han’s back.

Ling Han did not parry, but rather channelled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique. Instantly, it was as if he was like a dried up spring that had obtained a new life. Suddenly, endless power surged, instantly causing his speed to soar.

He suddenly sped up, breaking away from Li Changdan’s range of attack, and charged out in an instant.

“Where are you running to!” Li Changdan chased after him. He had lost all patience.

Pu!

Ling Han had just dashed out, when he suddenly felt a frightening killing intent assault him. At this moment, a purple-colored brilliance surged out from his chest, diminishing that killing intent slightly.

Even so, he still spluttered out a mouthful of blood. Pa, he could no longer run, and directly collapsed onto the ground.

“Ling— ah!” Li Changdan chased out, and when he saw Ling Han lying flat on the ground, he was naturally overjoyed. He was just about to chase after him and take him down, when an incredibly fierce killing intent assaulted him, causing him to be completely unguarded. His legs were instantly severed at the knee.

Peng! He too collapsed onto the ground, blood gushing out like a fountain. The pain caused him to let out a non-stop bloodcurling scream.

His face was filled with fear and disbelief. A prodigy like him had an incredibly bright future ahead of him, but now, he had become a cripple. How could he accept this? How could he not be terrified?

As shrewd as he was, now he was having a mental breakdown.

Ling Han picked himself up with much difficulty. He lowered his head to look, and the pendant hanging on his chest was presently exuding a faint purple light, spreading out into an area.

Obviously, he had only fallen down because he had the protection of this pendant. Looking at Li Changdan’s miserable state, one would know the result of barging in here rashly.

Could this be attributed to his own luck?

Ling Han scratched his head. He didn’t run anywhere else, and there were also countless crossroads, but he came here nonetheless. It was as if there was a hand controlling the fate of everything in this world.

Only at this moment was he in the mood to survey the place.

Aside from these buildings, there were also a great many trees here. Their types were all different, but only one bore fruit. It was very short, only about five feet tall, and there were three bright red fruits on it.

In the case of other trees, to say nothing of bearing fruit, even their leaves would not grow, as if they had withered for several hundred years.

So fragrant!

Ling Han sniffed with his nose. The fruit was exuding a fragrance, and just a single sniff was enough to stir the power in his body.

That was a treasured tree!

Ling Han thought to himself, and revealed a joyful expression. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Just a single sniff was enough to produce such an effect. If he consumed it, his cultivation level would definitely improve greatly. This was much more powerful than that Precious Tree in Monkey Valley.

However, as Ling Han’s gaze swept across the vicinity, it might appear to be peaceful here, but he knew that danger lurked in every step.

A formation!

Previously, he had barged in rashly, and triggered the attack of the formations. Thankfully, the pendant on his neck took effect, which caused him to only spit out a little blood. Otherwise, his arms and legs would definitely have been broken.

He glanced at Li Changdan. That guy was still wailing in grief. Fate really played tricks on him. This pendant had originally belonged to Li Changdan, but he had deliberately taken the initiative to trifle with Ling Han. Otherwise, how could he have suffered such a calamity?

“This is called fate.” Ling Han sighed, but did not know how lethal this sentence was to Li Changdan.

Since the pendant could suppress the effects of the formations to the limited extent, can it let him approach the fruit trees, pick the fruit, and then enter those buildings to see if there were any ancient books left behind inside them?

——This must have been left by an ancient civilization.

Ling Han picked himself up and started deducing.
