2701 Defeating a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate

“There is no one from the Yun Clan that would surrender without a fight,” Yun Haoyang stated evenly, but these words were powerful and resonating.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Though the Yun Clan’s way of doing things is not impressive, you as an individual are just enough to be considered passable.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go all out in a battle then!” Yun Haoyang’s figure rose, directly soaring into the clouds.

The present Ling Han’s cultivation level had increased, so should the two battle, the force of the shock waves created would be terrifying. They definitely had to take their battle far from the Yun Clan. Otherwise, with the impact of any single shock wave, the Yun Clan would have to be rebuilt.

With a bounce, Ling Han also shot into the skies.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them did not waste time on speaking another word, and immediately erupted into a great battle.

Under usual battle prowess, neither of them would be disadvantaged in their exchange of blows.

But everyone knew that Yun Haoyang had lost, and it was a terrible loss at that.

Just how great was the gap between Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier and Celestial King Tier?

This should have been a completely one-sided battle, but now, not only could he not suppress his opponent, they were even battling to a tie.

Yun Haoyang released a battle cry, using various secret techniques casually. He was already standing at the pinnacle of the Celestial Path, and various Regulations channeled according to his will. He plucked streaks of great dao easily one after another, and they turned into various weapons that launched a fierce offensive on Ling Han.

Ling Han was not afraid at all. He was also standing at the pinnacle of the Celestial Path; in terms of height, not only was he not inferior to Yun Haoyang, he would also not lose to a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, either. This was already the limit in terms of Regulations.

You could extract Regulations, and so would I. Who would be more afraid of whom?

Countless stars fell, turning into innumerable shooting stars that streaked through the world.

These were all Star Stones, and there were even some Star Stones that contained Divine Metal. After many years, there would definitely be countless people coming here to hunt for treasure. If they could obtain Divine Metal, that naturally would mean becoming rich overnight.

But now, everyone could only flee in a panic. With so many stars dropping down from the skies—and there were slivers of the two great elites’ martial intent wrapped around some of them at that—if one of them landed on a person, that person would definitely die immediately.

Peng!

Ling Han and Yun Haoyang exchanged a blow, and both of them were sent flying as far as 50 km backwards.

However, if one compared closely, they would discover that Ling Han actually retreated around 30 meters less than Yun Haoyang.

This kind of advantage was practically negligible, but it was a clear sign that Ling Han’s battle prowess was indeed stronger than Yun Haoyang’s, even if it was just a little bit stronger.

Yun Haoyang’s expression was filled with shock and disbelief.

He had already guessed that after Ling Han advanced into the Ninth Heaven, his battle prowess would possibly not be inferior to his own, but Ling Han’s strength reaching this extent was something that he could not accept at all.

He had actually been surpassed by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

It was not because of the Heavenly Venerate Tool’s strength, but rather because his battle prowess was outmatched, and it was indeed a pure suppression of strength.

Xiu! Using this momentum, Yun Haoyang retreated quickly, and then used the Heavenly Venerate Technique. He extracted a sliver of the fundamental power of the Genesis World, and solidified it into a golden arrow.

This was the strongest secret technique of the Yun Clan. If it was used by the grand elder of the Yun Clan, one arrow could kill a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han did not dodge, but rather went forwards to greet it head-on.

However, he dared not be careless. Using the Five Elements Lightning Technique, he wrapped the lightning around his fists, and nine-colored lightning instantly flashed brightly.

“Go!” Yun Haoyang shot the arrow. Xiu! This arrow was indescribably fast.

Peng!

Ling Han threw a punch, which landed on the golden arrow.

Instantly, the brilliant light burst like a firework. Even the stars that were very far away fell as well, completely incapable of bearing the wave of power created by the unleashed battle prowess of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. It should be known that there was an instant that the battle prowess of the two elites had soared to the height of the Heavenly Venerable Tier after releasing this powerful attack. Just how terrifying was that?

If this was in the Celestial Realm, it would not be condoned by the heaven and earth, and they would send lightning to strike the two of them down.

Ling Han roared. His fighting spirit blazed, and he sped up towards Yun Haoyang, brandishing both fists in a flurry of punches.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! His strikes rained down.

Yun Haoyang was both angered and stunned. If Ling Han had drawn the Divine Demon Sword, he would have willingly admitted defeat. That was because there was nothing to be aggrieved over upon having lost to a Heavenly Venerate Tool. But when both of them were fighting with their own individual strength, and he still lost to a Ninth Heaven, how could he endure such humiliation?

Unfortunately, faced with that storm of blows from Ling Han, he was actually feeling strained.

How was this possible?

He was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, who had had his body tempered by the fundamental power of the Genesis World, and had an amazing Body Art. For example, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could only launch 10,000 attacks in a single breath, yet he could deliver 100,000 attacks. Thus, even when power was equal on both sides, he could also use this kind of intensive round of attacks to suppress all Celestial Kings.

But in Ling Han’s case?

He could deliver 100,001 attacks. Even though there was only one extra attack, his advantage would build up slowly over time, and ultimately form a qualitative change.

Could you believe it? His Body Art, the Body Art of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, was actually no match for Ling Han!

This was natural. Before Ling Han had reached the Celestial King Tier, he had already been able to extract Void Particle Energy to temper his body, and judging from the breach of cultivation level, it had far surpassed Yun Haoyang. Moreover, Void Particle Energy was stronger than that unique power of the dimension, which naturally meant that Ling Han’s Body Art was slightly superior.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

In a countless clash of blows, Yun Haoyang finally could no longer block Ling Han’s fists, and they landed on him, forming a frightening impact.

“Impossible!”

“Heavens!”

Seeing this scene, every member of the Yun Clan could not believe it. There were some that were even grabbing their heads, falling to their knees and sobbing.

Their Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was going to lose, defeated by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

This was an extraordinary, extreme humiliation.

The longer the battle continued, the more attacks Yun Haoyang would sustain. Fists landed on his face, body, and legs, causing his body to distort, and a great many grooves appeared.

There was not the slightest bit of overstatement about this kind of battle. Every blow was a clash of absolute power. Whoever’s speed and power could not catch up, the disadvantage would be immediately apparent, and would be endlessly compounded upon.

If it was not for the fact that those below the Celestial King Tier could not see the battle clearly at all, even Mountain River Tiers would be able to easily distinguish that it was only a matter of time for Yun Haoyang to suffer defeat.

The Celestial Kings of the Yun Clan seemed to have lost their souls. This was something that they could never accept.

Yun Haoyang fought fiercely, and did not take a single step back.

If he fled, Ling Han would only be slightly superior to him, and could not possibly stop him. Even if Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword, that might just be barely enough. But if Yun Haoyang fought to the death without retreating like this, then it would be two elites meeting on a narrow path, and the stronger would come out on top. He continued to suffer injuries, and his injuries accumulated without end. By the time it reached a certain point, he finally lost.

Peng!

He dropped down from the skies, crashing heavily on the ground, and creating a huge pit where he landed.

“Elder Hao!” The Celestial Kings of the Yun Clan all rushed towards him, and when they discovered that while Yun Haoyang was very seriously injured, it did not threaten his life, so they finally sighed in relief.

Ling Han also descended from the skies, his aura flooding out like a wave.

Though every member of the Yun Clan felt extreme hatred for Ling Han, none of them dared to make a sound as they were overwhelmed by his aura. They could only shiver in apprehension.

“Old Black, let’s go and loot them,” Ling Han said to the large black dog.

“Sure thing!” The large black dog was practically bursting with glee. He had already waited countless years for this day to come.

They entered into the Yun Clan, and searched around in a grand manner. The only thing they didn’t do was dig into the foundations.

But no one from the Yun Clan dared to stop them. In fact, they did not even dare to rebuke them, and could only watch helplessly as the most valuable possessions of the clan that had been accumulated over several epochs were all robbed.

“This boy’s power has already formed, and there is no one that can stop him now,” the Celestial Kings of the Yun Clan all mused ruefully, and were even more filled with regret. Why had they stood on opposing sides to Ling Han before?

Though this guy was the type to hold a grudge, he had never bullied others on his own volition.

The only ones that could be blamed for this were themselves.
