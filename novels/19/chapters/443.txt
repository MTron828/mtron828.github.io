Chapter 444: Lu Yang’s Strongest Move

Translator: DarkAngel_ Editor: Kurisu

Shen Zhong Cheng, twenty-ninth on the last Prodigy Roll. In this tournament, he managed to advance even further and squeeze into the top ten. He reached the eighth place this time. The name of the White-Robed Sword King resounded all over the world, and with him being merely in his early twenties, it was highly possible that he would become one of the leaders of the new generation of the north region.

And it was precisely this kind of outstanding genius that was completely suppressed and thrashed easily by another. A consecutive bout of seven punches was enough to defeat him; what kind of concept was that?

A shocked stillness fell upon all the spectators. How did the Winter Moon Sect come to possess such a freak? Against an opponent in the same cultivation level, seven punches were enough to defeat Shen Zhong Cheng. If he actually broke through to the Spiritual Infant Tier, then wouldn’t that mean that he could sweep away all those in the same cultivation level and be invincible for an era?

“I’ve lost!” Shen Zhong Cheng coughed up blood. Though he had not suffered too serious an injury, he had still been attacked quite harshly. However, a heated battle intent continued to burn within his eyes. “I will make you my aim, and one day, I will definitely defeat you!”

“I wish you good luck,” Ling Han said, smiling. He wouldn’t be using this identity for too long, and in future, Shen Zhong Cheng would have to seek out an inexistent person for a battle. Just the thought of it made Ling Han pity him a bit.

Shen Zhong Cheng stared at Ling Han for a moment longer before finally turning around and leaving.

“Heavens, so powerful. If this guy actually took part in the Prodigy Tournament, he’d definitely have the ability to attempt seizing the first place?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Perhaps he does not think the Prodigy Roll is important at all?”

“That’s right. I remember there was a powerful guy who previously delivered a palm strike worth twenty Stars of the Spiritual Infant Tier of battle prowess, but he absolutely disdained taking part!”

“What, twenty Stars of Spiritual Infant Tier? Are you kidding me?”

“Hehe, you can make some casual enquiries. Who else doesn’t know about that?”

“With that kind of ability, there is of course no need for him to participate in the Prodigy Tournament. That would practically be playing around with kids, and much too degrading.”

“That may not be the case. That person said that he had used a Spirit Tool which was what allowed him that kind of battle prowess.”

“Hehehe, I, too, am more willing to believe that theory.”

In the midst of the conversations of the spectators, the battles proceeded.

The senior elite cultivators had indeed not wasted their years spent cultivating. Even if they had similar battle prowess of the same cultivation level with their opponent, their cultivation was much higher, and they had all reached the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Furthermore, they had all stayed at this level for a certain period of time and strengthened their foundations to an incredible extent.

Thus, the senior elite cultivators all qualified for the next round, and only a very few rookies managed to display outstanding performance with even more powerful battle prowess.

For example, Lu Yang, combined with his pet Demonic Beast, possessed amazing battle prowess. There was also Yang Jun Hao—obviously, this was his first time taking part in the Prodigy Tournament, yet he had the “peak” cultivation of the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. They did not allow the mature generation to be the only outstanding people. In addition, there was also Ling Han and that masked man. The vigor of the younger generation was in no way inferior.

The second round of battles concluded, and the third round quickly began right after. This time, Ling Han’s opponent was Lu Yang, ranked second in the Prodigy Roll this year.

Being able to defeat Zhu Xuan Er, someone whom many had expected to be the first place this year, there was of course no need to doubt Lu Yang had powerful battle prowess. However, the person he now faced was Ling Han, whose battle prowess had surpassed the upper limits that could be calculated in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Obviously, he was destined for a tragic ending.

He and his pet Demonic Beast, Frost Clouded Leapard, ascended the stage together and stood unyielding like a mountain.

Lu Yang was a powerfully built man. In such cold weather, he had still worn a short robe, which exposed his broad shoulders. It was as if they were forged from rock; he seemed like he could topple the mountains and crack the earth with a casual punch.

And the Frost Clouded Leopard looked even mightier. Its body was three meters long and reached a height of two metres. It was completely covered with a snow-white fur coat like it was excellent fine satin. With every exhalation, frost would immediately appear in the surrounding cold air, which rustled down onto the stage.

“Han Lin, I cannot help but admit, you are the strongest opponent I have ever faced!” Lu Yang stared at Ling Han. “You are worthy of a full-effort battle from me. I’ll use a powerful move that I had not used even in the Prodigy Tournament some days ago!”

When they heard his words, the spectators were all astonished. This guy had already charged all the way to the second place of the Prodigy Roll, and he actually had not used all his ability? He actually still had a powerful move in reserve? Hiss, why hadn’t he used it then? Could it be that he did not want to take the position of first place?

“Wrong. Since it’s the most powerful move, he will of course not use it easily. Otherwise, if others knew of it beforehand, they could stay on alert in advance.”

“En, it’s fine even if he was ranked second in the Prodigy Tournament. Anyways, the rankings would be rearranged again next year, and he would only need to show enough battle prowess and he’d still be able to turn the tide around and get first place.”

“Now, for the sake of the key to open up the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realms, he can no longer afford to care about that.”

“Of course. As long as he could obtain the inheritance inside, he could possibly become an ultimate cultivator of the Shattering Void Tier in future. Anyone would put their best effort in for that kind of reward!”

“Ya, I had initially thought that Han Lin was definitely going to win this battle, but there seems to be a bit of suspense for the end of this battle now.”

“Hehe, it’ll be more exciting with a little suspense!”

Ling Han smiled and said, “Oh, then I hope you will not be disappointed!” He currently was invincible among all those in the same cultivation tier, and felt a cold solitude. If there was somebody who could give him some trouble, he would in fact be very pleased.

“As you wish!” Lu Yang declared darkly. He suddenly leaped and charged towards Ling Han in attack, his hands forming a seal, and shouted, “Three Lives Three Destructions, Life and Death Reincarnation Seal!”

Hong , his palms formed uncountable numbers of tiny patterns which transformed into multiple simple, unadorned letters. Then they all shot out and shadowed Ling Han. This really was a little omnipresent, and cut off all paths of retreat for Ling Han.

Ling Han looked disappointed and asked, “This is your strongest move?” He shot out a punch in a very simple attack, but an endless shock wave of power spread out. Peng, peng, peng, peng , and these letters were instantly destroyed.

Lu Yang looked slightly surprised. Though he had not thought to use this one single move to defeat Ling Han, but the fact that the latter had so easily and delightedly dispersed his move still made him slightly shocked. However, he did not disappoint Ling Han, and immediately formed another seal and struck towards Ling Han.

Ling Han stood at the same spot, neither dodging nor ducking. He merely shot out another casual punch that easily dispersed Lu Yang’s attack. He yawened and said, “Are you going to use your strongest move or not? If not, I’m going to throw you off the stage then!”

When they heard these words, the spectators all hissed. How humongous was the tremendous gap in power between the two of them that caused Ling Hna to say something like that? This guy was so ferocious and powerful, so was there anyone else who could stop him now?

Lu Yang humphed and said, “Since you want to see it so much, I shall let you experience it then!” He once again pounced, and this time, that leopard actually moved as well. In an instant, it had raced to stand behind Ling Han. It opened its mouth and a white light shot out. It had not yet touched Ling Han’s back yet the endless iciness in its breath was already circulating, which instantly froze Ling Han where he was standing.

Layer after layer of ice appeared at a visible rate which instantly sealed Ling Han inside a three feet tall, one foot wide ice pillar.

However, after this move, light left the Frost Clouded Leopard’s eyes as well. It was as if it had lost a considerable amount of weight from its body, and could not help but lie on the ground.

So this was Lu Yang’s strongest move!

Obviously, the Frost Clouded Leopard could only use this kind of powerful move once in a short period of time. If it was not able to freeze its opponent, then the pet Demonic Beast would lose all ability to fight. Furthermore, the disciples of Beast Emperor Sect depended very much on the battle prowess of their pet Demonic Beast. If their pet Demonic Beast was unable to fight, then there would of course be a tremendous reduction in their battle prowess as well.
