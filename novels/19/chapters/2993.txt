2994 World’s Will

“What are you trying to say?” Ling Han asked.

Boom!

The ancient voice didn’t reply, and a mysterious power rushed into Ling Han’s body instead. It started to transform him in a mystical manner that was indescribable and unfathomable.

This power wasn’t very strong, but it was fundamentally transcendent above Ling Han’s defenses. Thus, it was able to enter his body with ease.

‘How is this possible?’

Even though Ling Han hadn’t obtained all six fundamental powers yet, and even though he hadn’t obtained an invincible physique yet, the combined power of hundreds of thousands of realms was definitely more than enough to defend against Seventh Tier attacks, so why was he so vulnerable at this moment?

No, no, no, this couldn’t be referred to as vulnerable. Instead, he was completely defenseless.

This was similar to how physically powerful people couldn’t necessarily defend themselves against spiritual attacks.

In any case, Ling Han was completely unable to resist this power.

‘F*ck! What the hell is this?’

Ling Han immediately tried to withdraw from the orb of light. However, he suddenly discovered that the orb of light had become unbelievably sticky, refusing to let him go.

Boundless fundamental power flowed through the surroundings, squeezing the air and preventing him from moving.

One had to realize that even Seventh Tier elites were unable to overcome the thick wall of fundamental particles. Right now, Ling Han also possessed a power that could rival those at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier. However, the fundamental particles inside the orb of light were even more concentrated than those in the wall. Thus, it was almost impossible for him to move.

Was he going to be trapped here?

If he were simply trapped, that naturally wouldn’t be a big deal. However, this orb of light had shot a beam of light into him before, and this caused the situation to become riddled with uncertainty.

This was because Hysteria had also shot a beam of light into his body, yearning to transform him into a loyal doppelganger. Now, this orb of light was shooting another beam of light into him. Could it be harboring any ill intentions?

Ling Han certainly didn’t want to become someone’s doppelganger. He was himself, an independent person.

Ling Han roared, causing his power to surge. At the same time, he channeled all of his seventh-grade seals and dimensions, allowing his battle prowess to soar to the peak stage of the Seventh Tier.

However, the concentrated fundamental particles had a vice-like grip on him, not allowing him to break free no matter what.

Boom!

An incredibly mighty voice sounded in his mind again.

“I’m the World’s Will,” the voice said,

“There’s no need to be afraid. I have no intentions of hurting you, nor am I able to hurt you.”

Ling Han chuckled in reply, and it was clear that he didn’t believe this.

This was a power that could restrict him, so just how insanely powerful was it? Moreover, his physique hadn’t reached a state of invincibility yet, so how could he dare to be careless?

“Just what kind of existence are you?”

The voice was silent for a moment before replying, “I’m not any specific force. Instead, I’m a power of will formed from the intertwining souls of the countless beings who were killed in the place you refer to as the Genesis World of the last era. I’m a power of will that’s transcendent above all matter.”

“So you’re saying that you can represent the Genesis World of the last era?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

“In some sense, yes,” the voice replied. “However, the Genesis World of the last era has already collapsed, destroying all life along with it. My power… is almost nonexistent.”

“Then why is this orb of light still able to restrict me?” Ling Han asked. Being able to restrict him, this was naturally no ordinary power. Instead, it was a power at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier—the greatest power in the world.

“No, this isn’t a decision made by my will. Rather, this is caused by the collapsed power of the Genesis World of the last area,” the voice replied.

Ling Han shrugged, and asked, “Then how do I break free?”

“There’s no need to be afraid. This place only exists because there’s still a sliver of my will that hasn’t dissipated yet. Since I’ve already seen you, there’s no longer a need for me to exist anymore,” the voice said.

Ling Han was still skeptical, and he asked, “So what do you want to tell me?”

“The burst of power that flowed into you just then made some changes and allowed you to truly possess the ability to transform into a Genesis World,” the voice replied.

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. There were countless dimensions inside him, and he could now rival the current Genesis World in this area. In fact, it was possible that he possessed a greater number of dimensions. This was because 10 dimensions of the Genesis World had already been engulfed, while no new dimensions had been born. Thus, he naturally possessed more dimensions inside his body.

However, Ling Han was still slightly inferior to the Genesis World.

Firstly, the dimensions inside him couldn’t reach the transcendent level. This was something proven throughout history.

Secondly, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate any additional dimensions. Not only that, but if a dimension were comprehensively destroyed, with not even a trace left, then he would lose this dimension forever. He wouldn’t be able to create it again.

However, the Genesis World obviously wasn’t like this. Instead, it was full of vitality and life, and it was able to nurture transcendent-level dimensions.

Even so, the voice in his mind—the power of will of the Genesis World of the last era—was suggesting that he could remedy these two shortcomings?

“That’s right. Even though your strength hasn’t increased by a single bit, you’ve been granted the ability to create countless possibilities,” the voice said. “However, only a sliver of my will remains, so all I can give you is this opportunity to create possibilities.”

An opportunity to create possibilities… This was already enough. Ling Han was confident that he could deal with this himself.

Even so, he wasn’t overly delighted, and he asked in a solemn voice, “Why me? Why choose me?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

During his previous life, he hadn’t exactly been outstanding in any sense. Thus, why had two paramount “mighty figures” both chosen him?

“There aren’t so many whys. If I had chosen someone else, that person would have also asked me why I had chosen them,” the voice replied. “If you really want a reason, then it’s because I saw a flash of the future while looking down the river of time. And you’re the person who can change the course of history.”

“So it’s only a possibility?” Ling Han asked.

“The future isn’t certain. When it comes to something that’s related to a powerful being like Hysteria, this is more so the case. It’s naturally even more difficult to catch a glimpse of the future. You don’t need to belittle yourself. The only help that I’ve given you is the opportunity to become boundlessly powerful. However, everything else is still up to you.”

Ling Han was rendered speechless. In reality, this opportunity was the biggest cheat code that he could receive. He was sure that if this great opportunity were given to Xin Qihu, Lin Youlian, or the others, they wouldn’t do any worse than him.

“Then what about Feng Wuding? He should be the Son of Destiny that you chose, right?”

“The world was collapsing at that time, while I had only just come into existence. I used a wisp of my power with great difficulty, and this allowed me to funnel the seeds of the Genesis World into the bodies of those five invincible beings, where they could be protected. However, I was unable to control my power properly, so a mark of World’s Will accidentally landed on one of the seeds.”

‘Oh, so Feng Wuding isn’t actually the Son of Destiny? He’s actually just an accident?’

Ling Han wore a strange expression. F*ck! And Lin Luo and Zhou Heng both had such high hopes for this person, so much so that Ling Han had been forced to show mercy time and time again. It was only because of this that Feng Wuding was still alive. Otherwise, Ling Han would have slapped him to death long ago.

‘What Son of Destiny? Pei!’

If they wanted to know who the true Son of Destiny was, then that was naturally him—even though Ling Han didn’t exactly fancy this identity.

However, Feng Wuding had indeed obtained many benefits because of this identity. For example, he possessed 100 dimensions, and this was far more than Xin Qihu, Lin Youlian, and the other greatest prodigies of all eternity.
