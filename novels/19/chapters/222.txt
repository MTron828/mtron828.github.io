Chapter 223: Silver-Armored Corpse

Ling Han looked at the third tier Bronze-Armored Corpse, frowning slightly.

He might not be able to defeat a third tier Bronze-Armored Corpse, but it wouldn’t be able to kill him, either. The key was that his opponent was pulling on three caskets; in other words, there was still one Corpse Soldier that didn’t appear.

Another Bronze-Armored Corpse, or… a Silver-Armored Corpse?

Even a first tier Silver-Armored Corpse was equivalent to a Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivator. Ling Han was freakishly strong, but not so to the degree of being able to fight a Spiritual Ocean Tier head-on with brute force. Besides, Corpse Soldiers couldn’t feel, did not fear death nor being hurt, and unless their head was blown up, they’d never lose their battle capability, making them extremely hard to deal with.

More importantly, Corpse Soldiers came from refinement. During this process, a Corpse Soldier’s body became extremely durable, comparable to cast metal materials of the same tier. How would he break through it?

Thus, to completely kill a Corpse Soldier, one needed to surpass the corpse by an entire tier to shatter it completely through overwhelming power.

Ling Han’s power right now was equivalent to the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, insufficient to take care of even a third tier Bronze-Armored Corpse, not to mention a Silver-Armored Corpse. Besides, even if he could instantly kill Rong Huan Xuan, Corpse Soldiers wouldn’t die because the puppeteer was dead; on the contrary, they’d break away from control and kill based on their instincts.

However, Rong Huan Xuan was in the fifth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, not easy to kill anyway.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Inside your third casket, don’t tell me there’s a Silver-Armored Corpse?”

Instantly, Rong Huan Xuan’s expression changed slightly, and he sneered as he said, “You know quite a bit about the Thousand Corpse Sect!”

Ling Han said no more and immediately bolted, grabbing Hu Niu with the left hand and carrying Yang Ming in the right hand. Xiu xiu xiu , in an instant they turned into a small black dot.

Sure enough, there was a Silver-Armored Corpse—to hell with fighting!

“Ah…” Rong Huan Xuan was dumbfounded, then let out a sky-shaking angry roar. He completely didn’t expect Ling Han to run so decisively. “Good-for-nothing! Good-for-nothing!” he yelled at the two Corpse Soldiers in anger. However, Corpse Soldiers would only commence battle after he gave them the command to; otherwise, if they had their own intentions, they’d probably kill him first and eat his flesh and blood completely.

“Hmph!” After a while, he settled down, and said to himself, “It’s nothing, that guy will definitely go to the central hall. I’ll kill everyone there, and my three Corpse Soldiers will all level up.

I hear that there are Blood Zombies here. Their battle power is comparable to Flower Blossom Tier cultivators, if I can get three of those… hehe!

The Blood Zombie only appears when the blood sacrifice is insufficient. If I kill everyone in the central hall, then the Blood Zombie will definitely appear!

Haha, hahahaha!”

He kept laughing maniacally.

***

Only after Ling Han ran nearly fifty kilometers at a stretch did he stop, offhandedly throwing Yang Ming to the side and placing Hu Niu down.

Yang Ming was probably never treated in such a rough way—the veins on his neck popped out and he made a furious face, but as he thought about the difference in strength between him and Ling Han, he immediately suppressed his anger.

“Young Master Han, the ravine is right ahead. Let’s go!” he said impatiently.

Ling Han nodded. His Dantian was unusually large—after he ran fifty kilometers at a stretch, he only used up nearly ten percent of his Origin Power, which could be quickly recovered by taking a second level Return Origin Pill.

…If people were to see it, they’d definitely scold him for squandering money. Return Origin Pills were definitely used during battle, because normally one would meditate to recover Origin Power, and where would one get the time to do that during a battle?

Ling Han was overbearingly rich and least lacking in medicinal pills, eating them casually.

They were certainly closer to the ravine; in a few minutes at most, they’d be able to walk to the entrance.

“Ling Han!”

From afar, someone waved at them, and quite a few people were there. After a close look, it was Qi Yong Ye and the others.

Ling Han sped up his footsteps as he walked over, only to see that other than Li Si Chan, Guang Yuan, and Li Hao and his partner, everyone who journeyed together earlier was here.

“Who is this?” They looked at Yang Ming.

“This humble one is Yang Ming, no one important.” Yang Ming hurriedly paid obeisance to the others, acting very humbly. However, when his eyes swept past Liu Yu Tong, a breath-taken expression flashed across his face, and he couldn’t help but look twice more, finally lowering his head.

“This isn’t a place to talk, we go in first!” Ling Han said seriously. Rong Huan Xuan could appear from behind at any time… Rong Huan Xuan himself wasn’t a big deal, but the key was that he brought a Silver-Armored Corpse. In a place where Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivators ruled, the Silver-Armored Corpse was almost an invincible being.

Everyone saw his solemn expression and none opposed, as they were all waiting for Ling Han to arrive anyways. Since the man of the hour arrived, why not leave?

On the way, Ling Han explained the incident regarding Rong Huan Xuan. Hearing it, everyone’s hair stood up.

Corpse Soldier?

They’ve never heard of it, what the hell was that?

“The Blood Zombies here, could they be Corpse Soldiers?” Baili Teng Yun guessed.

“Possibly!” The others nodded in succession. This would explain why Rong Huan Xuan appeared; perhaps, there was Thousand Corpse Sect’s inheritance here, and Rong Huan Xuan was here to take it.

“An inheritance like that, even if it’s God Tier, I wouldn’t want it!” Li Dong Yue shook his head like a rattle-drum.

The others also shook their heads in succession. Nurturing a corpse… just the thought of it gave them goosebumps. If they were really to ‘enjoy’ its company day and night, it was possible they’d puke themselves to death.

“Guang Yuan still hasn’t arrived?” Ling Han frowned. The only person by his side that could go against a Silver-Armored Corpse was Guang Yuan, and without that old fellow blocking in front, whoever encountered the Silver-Armored Corpse would only get shredded to pieces.

A Silver-Armored Corpse needed a Spiritual Ocean Tier’s body to evolve, so they didn’t even qualify as “food.”

“Senior Guang Yuan was teleported near another ravine,” Liu Yu Tong said with a bit of regret—the Spiritual Ocean Tier was the strongest force here. With Guang Yuan here, they would be a lot safer.

“Forget it, let’s go!”

On the way, Yang Ming became livelier after he grasped everyone’s situation, calling others brothers. However, he never leaked his identity, and no one was suspicious of him because of Ling Han.

This ravine looked like a stretch of sky from afar, but when actually walking inside, one would definitely be shocked by the ravine’s scale… fifty kilometers long and around one kilometer in width, not to mention straight through and through just as if cut by a sharp weapon—no single place was even a bit wider or a bit narrower.

Several hundred kilometers was naturally no big deal for martial artists in Element Gathering Tier. After a long period of time, they walked past the long ravine, and a majestic hall appeared ahead.

At the first sight of the large hall, everyone revealed a shocked expression, for the edifice was floating in the air, connected to rows of stairs that were floating as well—an impressive spectacle indeed.

“So, so magical!”
