Chapter 480: Red-haired Beasts

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

The massive golem blocked the door, while the Strange Fire blocked the enemies’ retreat, extinguishing the army of bugs continuously.

After merely ten minutes, the bug king was a general without an army. The Rock Spirit and the Strange Fire charged up, and the former suppressed the bug king with brute force while the latter burned it.

After a few minutes, the Flower Blossom Tier bug king was utterly burned into ashes. Rock Spirit was only burnt black, recovering to normal with a gentle wipe.

... If the Rock Spirit fought with the Strange Fire, Strange Fire’s high heat would be useless against the Rock Spirit, but Rock Spirit’s attacks might not harm Strange Fire’s real body; the two were probably in a relation where neither one could do anything about the other.

Of course, this was a situation where the two were at the same tier; otherwise, the Strange Fire could also boil rocks into ash, and the Rock Spirit could also extinguish the flames.

“Master Ling, you truly have heaven-defying fortune. A powerful puppet on top of the ball of the Strange Fire, you could do whatever you want amongst Flower Blossom Tier beings.” Yue Kai Yu highly praised, revealing a look of admiration.

Flower Blossom Tier creatures surpassed mortals, and even though he was not far from the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier—maybe about two or three years’ time, advancing from the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier to the Flower Blossom Tier might take five years, ten years, or even twenty years wouldn’t be rare.

Ao Feng was Winter Moon Sect’s strongest genius in a hundred years, but wasn’t he also over forty when he advanced into the Flower Blossom Tier? Yue Zhen Shan was now still at the half-step Flower Blossom Tier, and crossing that other half a step might take him until tomorrow, or he might not take it for another twenty years; perhaps, there might be no hope in this life.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Brother Yue can just call me by name or Master Han. Master Ling and whatnot makes me seem old.”

Yue Kai Yu obviously didn’t dare to call Ling Han by name. This was a Heaven Grade alchemist who had astonishing means, killing even a Flower Blossom Tier bug king. He would rather be prudent. “Then Master Han it is.”

Ling Han laughed inwardly; if Yue Kai Yu knew his true identity, would he be angered from embarrassment?

He walked towards the remains again, and resisted the soul spirit severing pain with great difficulty, enveloping the remains to store it inside the Black Tower.

“Ah!” he yelled tragically as blood gushed out of his mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. He appeared extremely tragic. However, the divine bones were stored inside the Black Tower—it wasn’t to no avail.

He slumped onto the ground, breathing heavily.

“Master Han, how are you?” Guang Yuan and Yue Kai Yu both asked. They naturally saw the remains disappear, but that simply storing a corpse could make the seven apertures bleed was truly strange.

Ling Han wiped the blood on his face and said, “I’m fine!”

The three circled around the black temple, seeking for anything that might be left. Nothing was found, but the surrounding walls were carved with many characters, or rather symbols.

They understood nothing.

The three of them felt like they’d never learned to read, looking at the wall full of words and being unable to recognize even a single one.

‘Were these characters from the god realm?’ Ling Han said inwardly. He knew something others didn’t: this mystery realm was most probably severed from the god realm, so the words that appeared here could also be divine words.

Wasn’t it normal that mortals couldn’t understand divine words?

“Whatever, let’s go.” They left the black temple and the world had already reverted to its brightness. Even the bug king was eliminated, so as the remaining bugs were limited, they were very soon extinguished thoroughly.

However, the battle was just now as a bit chaotic, and the people could no longer be seen in the surroundings. It was unknown where they ran off to.

Ling Han didn’t care. The three continued onwards. Advancing for about five thousand meters, another black temple appeared in front of them.

“Don’t tell me there’s another swarm of bugs in there?” Yue Kai Yu said with lingering fear.

“Then that would be too great!” Ling Han said smilingly. With a swarm of bugs, it meant that there should be another divine skeleton inside just for him to take. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yue Kai Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes. How could there be such a strange person—that temple didn’t have any treasures... did you really like fighting with those bugs that much?

Guang Yuan gave him a sympathetic look. Following Ling Han for a while, he knew just how much Ling Han loved to adventure.

They entered the black temple, and as expected, encountered a nest of bugs. Ling Han summoned the golem and the Strange Fire once again, smoothly extinguishing the bugs; but this time, the bug king didn’t fight to the death and ran away.

Ling Han didn’t think of chasing it and just took away the divine bones on the sacrificial table, naturally bleeding from seven apertures; his divine sense 1was like it was being cut, almost tearing him into pieces.

‘I can’t stand any more.’ If he took another corpse, his soul would definitely be scattered, turning him into an empty shell.

Ling Han felt deeply regretful. These were divine remains, and even if it had no divine essence remaining, the bones alone had huge research value.

He could only wait until his divine sense recovered to take it again.

The three continued on. This space of this layer was huge, and every five thousand meters would be a black temple. They avoided it from afar, so no swarm of bugs stormed at them. After walking for five hundred thousand meters, they finally reached the layer’s end. Ahead was a grand golden wall, and on the side were stairways to the next layer.

They weren’t the first to arrive. Amongst those who were separated earlier, one-third came here—about twenty people or so.

No one recklessly headed towards the third layer, because they already had a hard time in the second layer and wasted many spirit talismans and even law decrees, obtaining nothing in return. If it were the same in the third layer, and with even greater danger, then they definitely wouldn’t want to go up.

Ling Han was naturally unafraid. However, when he was about to enter the stairway, he was startled, turning his head to look into the distance.

Influenced by him, Yue Kai Yu and Guang Yuan also followed his gaze, but saw nothing.

...They didn’t cultivate the Eye of Truth, so their eyesight couldn’t be compared to Ling Han’s at all.

“Something’s coming!” Ling Han warned.

Guang Yuan and Yue Kai Yu hurriedly prepared for battle. The other people couldn’t see anything, which instantly made some people despise and curse Ling Han inwardly for acting cool and all.

However, in a short while, something red flashed in the distance, and in an instant, it was even closer.

‘Hiss!’

When everyone could see it, they all gasped in astonishment. These were six red-haired beasts in the form of humans. Their height was normal; and their entire body was full of red hair—even their looks couldn’t be clearly seen. Indistinctly, a pair of gleaming red eyes and a fierce-looking mouth could be seen.

These red-haired beasts had no intention of communicating with them. Once they arrived, they immediately launched attacks. Xiu, xiu, xiu , they were ridiculously fast as they leapt towards one person.

People had no sense of propriety all of a sudden, and those who weren’t attacked naturally didn’t recklessly intervene, carefully observing. The person that was attacked sneered and said, “Scatter!”

He swung his sword. Seven flashes of Sword Qi waved as martial intent manifested and condensed into seven large mountains, about to crush the six red-haired beasts.

He cultivated earth-type arts, and when martial intent was produced, it turned into a lofty mountain. This was a phantom form, but its weight was not fake at all—even those who were his match in strength would feel it unbearable if they were struck.
