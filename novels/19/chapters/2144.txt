Chapter 2145: Corroded corpse

“Ha, the poison has really not been cured.” Lin Xuan deliberately laughed. “Ling Han was right.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Hearing these words from him, Ai Kaifeng and their group were naturally very displeased about him, but more of their antagonism was directed at Ling Han. Well, it was he that had indeed spoken such words. Naturally, the four of them thought that he was the villain.

Ling Han glanced at Lin Xuan. This man was really a poisonous being. This was a move to deliberately draw animosity towards him.

“E… E… E…” Bie Ziwen was moaning louder and louder, and then suddenly jumped to his feet in a bounce. His posture was extremely weird, his legs not bending, and he was just standing there as erect as a wooden stick.

A spine-chilling aura exuded from those eerily pale eyes. His gaze was focused on Lao Liang, and he suddenly pounced over, opening his mouth and directing a bite at the latter’s throat.

“Brother Bie, have you gone mad?” Lao Liang hurriedly retreated.

It was as if Bie Ziwen had indeed gone mad, his mouth releasing groans that could not be heard clearly as he continued to bite fiercely at Lao Liang.

“The poison in Senior Brother Bie’s body has not been dispersed. It would be useless to try convincing him, we have to capture him!” Ai Kaifeng called out, and was the first to make his move.

Lao Liang and Di Tongxin also moved quickly, suppressing Bie Ziwen together, while Yulan Fenghua was only standing on the sidelines, and watching the show. Though he was esteemed as the strongest Holy Son in the history of Imperial Void Sect, limited by his cultivation level, this was above his pay grade.

The three moved together, and attacked Bie Ziwen in unison.

However, their cultivation levels and strength were close and similar with Bie Ziwen, so how could it be any easy matter to capture the latter?

The present Bie Ziwen did not have any consciousness at all, and was only aware of opening his mouth and biting others. He did not recognize anyone, and had no scruples, but Ai Kaifeng and the others did not dare attack him too severely. In this manner, even if they had an advantage in numbers, the advantage would be canceled out.

“Brother Lin Xuan, Holy Daughter An Ran, please help us.” Di Tongxin requested assistance.

Lin Xuan looked towards An Ran, and the latter nodded. The two of them immediately moved, joining the battle. They were much less reserved in their attacks. So what if they wounded Bie Ziwen severely? He could slowly recuperate after this.

Ai Kaifeng and their group could not attack conveniently, and thus did not stop An Ran and Lin Xuan. On the contrary, they were responsible for restraining Bie Ziwen’s attacks so that An Ran and Lin Xuan could go all out and attack freely.

Ling Han was bored, and watched the show, his arms crossed over his chest.

“I had never really thought that Brother Ling would actually be a member of the Four Seas Palace.” Yulan Fenghua walked over, shaking his head, and bringing a hint of rebuke in his expression. “Brother Ling, you are really too unfriendly, hiding even this from me.”

Ling Han chuckled, “It’s a long story, and cannot be summed up in a few words. In brief, I had not deliberately meant to deceive Brother Yulan.”

Yulan Fenghua also smiled, his gaze flickering slightly. He was measuring his losses and gains. If he moved and got Ling Han killed, just how much trouble would it cause for himself? He thought for a moment, and an idea suddenly came to him.

There was no need for him to personally move. He could borrow the help of those four senior brothers and senior sister. He was sure that Ai Kaifeng and the others were already quite displeased with Ling Han by now.

…Right. This had been stirred up by Lin Xuan as well. Could it be that there was internal conflict within the Four Seas Palace?

This could be exploited.

On the other side, the five great monarch tiers moving together finally suppressed Bie Ziwen. After all, the present Bie Ziwen did not have any intelligence, and knew only to attack, so it was definite that his battle prowess would be greatly reduced.

Each of the five great monarch tiers placed a restriction on Bie Ziwen. In this way, unless Bie Ziwen’s strength was superior to their combined strength, it would be completely impossible for him to break out of these restrictions.

“Every step is thorny!” they exclaimed ruefully.

They had not even taken that many steps, and already one of their numbers was down. Just how dangerous was this Mystery Realm?

After stowing Bie Ziwen away into a Spatial God Tool, the seven of them continued their journey.

This time, they had learned their lesson, keeping their feet elevated about one foot from the ground. In this way, there would be no need to fear that something like that insect sting would stab into the soles of their feet.

They were not walking very quickly, and not long after, nine fallen bodies appeared abruptly ahead of them.

“They’re all dead.”

“Judging by the extent of decomposition, they’ve been dead for at least several billion years.”

“Yi, that’s not right. Hasn’t this Mystery Realm just been discovered? Furthermore, it’s a Lost Land from the Ancient Age at that. How could there possibly be a corpse that is just several billion years old?”

They exchanged looks, and thought that there was a strangeness about this that could not be described.

“Could it be that several billion years ago, someone has already entered this place?”

“That’s right. It is not definite that a Mystery Realm has to be fully opened to allow entry. In the first place, it was already here. Someone must have accidentally barged into this space, though not a single person managed to leave alive, and that was why this place has never been discovered all this while.”

Logically, this could be explained. The seven people nodded. This should be the most logical explanation.

“The corpses have not been touched. Judging from the look of things, internal strife should have happened among the nine of them, and they killed each other.” They continued their deductions.

“It is also possible that they belonged to two different sides, and just happened to encounter one another here, which was followed by the outbreak of battle.”

“That’s also possible.”

There was naturally nothing much to see about the corpses. The seven of them very quickly resumed their advance, but they had just taken a few steps when Lao Liang suddenly exclaimed in shock, and then turned around and backtracked.

“What is it?” Everyone hurriedly followed him.

Not long later, Lao Liang had already returned to where the nine corpses were laid out. He began to flip over a body, and he found a jade pendant on that body. He carefully examined it for a while, and an expression of astonishment appeared on his face.

“Senior Brother Lao, what is it?” Ai Kaifeng asked.

At first, Lao Liang did not speak. After a while, he replied, “I know this person. His name is Yu Kaicheng.” He waved that jade pendant. “And I have been the one to gift this to him too.”

“What!?” Everyone was incredibly stunned by these words, and an intense coldness rose up in them.

It should be known that Lao Liang’s flame of life had only been burning for around 700-800 million years, but these corpses were at least several billion years old. In that case, how would Lao Liang have known this Yu Kaicheng?

Was he seeing things?

“Senior Brother Lao, are you sure that this person is indeed Yu Kaicheng?” Di Tongxin asked.

“Perhaps… Yu Kaicheng has also come here, and something happened, causing him to leave his jade pendant on this corpse?”

“That’s right. It’s horribly corroded, and there is completely no way to distinguish the facial features.”

Lao Liang shook his head. “The jade pendant has not been dropped on this corpse, but was hidden on this corpse. Hence, this person must definitely be Yu Kaicheng!”

‘Could it be that it was impossible that you have mistaken the jade pendant?’

These words were the doubt in everyone’s mind, but no one spoke it out loud. Since Lao Liang was already so sure, mentioning such words would be equivalent to slapping him in the face.

Ling Han took two steps forwards, and carefully examined the nine corpses.

Previously, they had only been rummaging through the Spatial God Tools of these nine people. There weren’t any treasures inside. However, Ling Han placed his focus on their wounds this time.

“Insect sting!” Ling Han discovered a wound on the sole of the foot of one of them, where a gleaming blue insect sting was sticking out.

Everyone muttered, “Yi!”

It was an insect sting again!

“Could it be that this person had lost his senses due to the poison, and then killed all of his eight companions, and ultimately died from the poison himself?”

Lao Liang continued, “Over 200 years ago, I even met Yu Kaicheng once.”

His words incited even more shock from the others.

“Could it be that Yu Kaicheng has also just entered this place, and died not too long ago?”

“The natural environment here is unusual, causing a corpse that has only died several years or even several days ago to decompose so badly?”

“E… E… E…” Right at this moment, a corpse suddenly released a weird groan, exactly like how Bie Ziwen had done previously.
