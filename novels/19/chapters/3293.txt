Chapter 3294 - 3294: Chaos arises again

Translator: Henyee Translations    Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Bai was looking at something, and didn’t pay any attention to Ling Han. After a while, he raised his head and looked at Ling Han.

Shua, it was like two bolts of lightning had flashed past, piercing into one’s eyes.

“So you’re Ling Han?” Yang Bai stopped what he was doing.

“l am Ling Han.” Ling Han bowed slightly in respect. This was a sign of respect to elites.

There was only him and Yang Bai here, and there wasn’t even a single

attendant.

Yang Bai paused for a moment before saying, “Tell me in detail again about that Demonic Rat.”

Ling Han nodded, and began to explain everything from beginning to end.

He had already explained this matter once, so it would naturally be smoother for him to repeat it again. Moreover, this was a real matter in the first place, and he had only concealed some details.

A solemn expression appeared on Yang Bai’s face, and he asked, “Are you sure

that the aura of that Demonic Rat is no weaker than mine?”

Boom! He unleashed his aura, and it was as if an ocean had been expelled. This was a petrifying aura.

Ling Han’s face was as white as a sheet. The aura of an Inscription Tier elite was really too powerful.

However, he had withstood it.

He nodded, and said, “That’s right. The aura of that Demonic Rat is definitely not inferior to Lord Yang. Furthermore, it is still in a weak state. When it recovers, it should become even stronger.”

Yang Bai tapped his finger on the table, and said, “The Holy Emperor, His Majesty, has long since predicted that powerful Demonic Beasts would be suppressed in the various mountains and abysses. However, I had not expected that they would be able to escape so quickly.”

“It’s too early! His Majesty, the Holy Emperor, hasn’t completed his breakthrough yet!’

He paused, and said, “Ling Han, though the seal was destroyed by you, you have also made a great contribution by discovering this matter. I will keep this in mind.’

Ling Han nodded, “Thank you, milord.”

“Go on.” Yang Bai waved him off.

Ling Han left. He returned to the academy, where there were only a few days left until the new year.

He had already passed countless New Years, but the significance of this time was clearly different from the past, because this was the first New Year that he had spent in a new world.

Unfortunately, he did not have the company of the empress and the others.

Xuanyuan Dingguo delivered a few pieces of honey to Ling Han. This was what he had obtained in the cave on the first level, but Ling Han didn’t take it. Firstly, he had more honey which was higher in quality, and secondly, he didn’t want to owe Xuanyuan Dingguo a favor.

However, he still had a good chat with Xuanyuan Dingguo, because the modified version of the Qi Return Pill, the Mystical Power Pill, and the Meridian Exploration Pill had already entered the normal sales channel, and business was booming.

Wasn’t he afraid that those alchemists would bring the pill recipes with them and start their own business?

Of course not. With General Xuanyuan acting as the signboard, what alchemist would dare to go against the agreement?

Ling Han began a life of earning money by the day, which also allowed him to have enough money to buy the materials to create Middle Level and High Level formations. He was going to improve the standards of formations.

He bought a few Middle Level formations on the trading platform, and Niu Huaqing had already taught him the basics, Middle Level formation patterns, and High Level formation patterns. Now, he only needed to learn how to fuse formation patterns.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was the most difficult part. There were endless changes, and a person might not be able to predict all the changes even if he spent his whole life at it.

However, this was actually no big deal for Ling Han. It was one matter that his spiritual power hadn’t improved yet, but his memory was astonishingly good, and his ability of deduction was also incredibly strong. However, he couldn’t spend too much time, as his current spiritual power couldn’t support it yet.

The Middle Level formation, of course, also helped Blood Transformation Tier cultivators cultivate. This was called the Hundred Qian Formation, and it also expended the jade seeds as an energy source, but its help was far less than the rich man’s formation to a Meridian Opening Tier.

After all, the higher one’s cultivation level, the more difficult it would be to improve. Even a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator was still at the Elementary Level of martial arts.

This required a combination of Elementary Level Formation Patterns and Middle Level Formation Patterns. There was one-on-one fusion, one-on-many fusion, and many-on-many fusion, so the difficulty of carving would increase exponentially.

In just three days, Ling Han had already mastered this formation completely, and created the formation foundations.

He had already used this formation to begin cultivating. On the other side of things, there were alchemical pills that could speed up the cultivation of Blood Transformation Tier elites, such as the Mystical Power Pill, but in Blood Transformation Tier, it was called the Middle Level Mystical Power Pill. However, the ingredients needed to concoct these pills were completely different.

As usual, Ling Han began to modify the Middle Level Mystical Power Pill again. If he wanted to eat, he would definitely eat the best.

Just as he was burying himself in hard work, the new year arrived as expected.

The Imperial Capital was bustling with noise and excitement. The new year had passed, and whether it was the high-ranking officials or the common people, they had temporarily let go of the burdens of their lives, and enjoyed a few rare days of celebration.

However, it was also during this new year that many terrifying events took place.

Several small towns were razed to the ground, leaving no survivors.

Because it was something that had happened around the new year, at first, they only knew that they had been cut off from the network, and it was only when people from the surrounding towns had gone over, that they discovered the tragedy. The news spread back to the Imperial Capital, causing a commotion.

The present Holy Emperor’s might dominated the world, and even the powerful Demonic Beasts could only obediently withdraw from the nation’s borders, not daring to invade. They had already lived peacefully for so many years, but first, it was Huju City that was destroyed by the beast tide, and now, this kind of tragedy had happened. What exactly was going on here?

This undoubtedly affected the atmosphere of the new year, but very soon, an inspiring piece of news spread out.

The Holy Emperor had come out of seclusion!

Had he broken through?

No one knew. The Holy Emperor had not spoken, so who would dare ask?

Instantly, everyone in the world calmed down.

In everyone’s hearts, there was an unbreakable thought, and that was as long as the present Holy Emperor was standing guard, no demons would be able to invade the Dark North Nation.

Ling Han didn’t pay too much attention. After the new year, the tournament at the Formations Association Headquaters would begin.

He decided to go and be verified as a Formation Master.

To his surprise, this trip was very smooth. He didn’t encounter any ignorant second-generation young masters or arrogant formation geniuses. He successfully passed the certification and became Dark North Nation’s 4200th official formation master.

All right, the next step was to prepare for the Formation Master Tournament.

Theoretically speaking, each city could only send one formation master to participate, but the Imperial Capital Headquarters didn’t have this restriction. As long as one was certified at the headquarter, they were qualified to participate.

Of course, there was another very important condition, and that was one had to be below thirty years old.

The one-month deadline that Ling Han had given Huan Xue had passed. The little handmaiden did not have the slightest hope of discovering a Hidden

Meridian, so Ling Han allowed her to break through to Blood Transformation Tier, and gave her two Vermillion Fruits.

For a Twelve Meridians, one Vermillion Fruit was actually enough. However, who asked Ling Han to be so rich that he directly gave her two? One was naturally enough, and one more was for just in case.

The news of villages being destroyed still came from time to time, and judging from the distance, the culprit seemed to be heading towards the Imperial Capital.

This enraged the Holy Emperor. Coincidentally, General Hengtian had returned to the Imperial Capital to report the results of the investigation of the matter of Huju City. Thus, the Holy Emperor sent General Hengtian to quell the chaos.

On the sixth day after the new year, Ling Han once again headed to the Formation Association headquarters. He had already registered, and was here to participate in the tournament today.

“Ling Han?” A voice filled with surprise rang out behind Ling Han.

Yan Jun!
