Chapter 3365: See through illusions

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Alright,” Ling Han replied.

He punched out without holding back at all, but he did not use any secret techniques.

It was an ordinary punch, but its power was close to 5 million kilograms.

He knew that Eldest Baby’s strength was at least First Extreme, so there was no need to hold back at all.

Eldest Baby chuckled and waved her small fists to welcome him.

The two fists seemed to be completely disproportionate in size, but after colliding, Ling Han felt a tremendous power crashing over, causing his body to involuntarily tremble, and he retreated.

Teng, teng, teng, he retreated seven steps before he could stabilize himself.

Eldest Baby’s strength steadily reached First Extreme.

“Is this your full strength?” Ling Han asked.

“Of course not,” Eldest Baby said in a childish voice as she raised her fist. This time, there was black energy wrapped around it. It was even larger than her entire body.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be shocked. Although he still didn’t know the exact power of this ball of black energy, it was absolutely terrifying, causing him to feel a chill.

Sigh, it was really infuriating to compare oneself to others. A child could actually mobilize high-level energy. Moreover, be it in quantity or quality, she was far superior to him.

“Father, I’m also very powerful!” Second Baby quickly jumped out.

“What is your specialty?” Ling Han asked.

Second Baby giggled and said, “I can see very, very far. I can even see through illusions and grasp the essence.”

Clairvoyance and X-ray vision?

Ling Han thought for a moment, then took out a few stones, and laid them under a large rock. “How many stones are there?”

“Hmph, Father is so bad. He’s bullying me for not knowing how to count!” Second Baby said angrily. “One, three, eight, six, five, five!”

The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched slightly. Second Baby’s ability to count was really too weak, but the problem was that she was actually right.

There was no justice in this world. Did three come after one and was it eight after three?

He took out another fruit and hid it behind the stone. “What’s behind the stone?”

“Fruit.” Second Baby looked at Ling Han with a slightly strange expression. Her expression was no different from looking at a retard.

F*ck, he was being looked down on again.

Ling Han did not give up. He could also release his divine sense. “What color?”

“Most of them are green and a little red,” Second Baby described.

Completely. Right.

Ling Han sighed. Second Baby’s ability could be said to be very impressive when used as a support, but the problem was that this girl was too problematic when it came to counting. This would be fatal.

For example, the correct answer should be 11, but if she miscounted to 19, that would be ‘fun’.

Ling Han sighed. It seemed that in the future, apart from teaching these children not to be violent, he also had to teach them how to count.

When he saw Second Baby shift her gaze onto him, Ling Han couldn’t help but jump in fright, and hurriedly said, “Stop, stop, stop. In the future, you’re not allowed to look directly at me.”

Second Baby giggled and said, “Father, don’t worry. As long as I don’t take the initiative to do it, I can only see far. My sight can’t pass through obstacles and see through illusions.”

So that was how it was. Ling Han heaved a sigh of relief, and relaxed.

“However, I’ve just seen through the stone and haven’t stopped yet,” Second

Baby said again.

F*ck, are you messing with me?

Ling Han felt a headache coming on. Eldest Baby was a violent maniac, and such a tendency had not been discovered from Second Baby for the time being. However, she was eccentric and was not at all easier to manage than Eldest

Baby.

He was so tired.

Ling Han’s heart stirred. Second Baby’s ability was very similar to Wally’s scanning ability. Could he make use of it?

“Second Baby, help me take a look. Is there anything in my body that hasn’t been polished perfectly?” he asked.

“Okay!” Second Baby jumped up and looked at Ling Han.

There were clearly no rays of light shooting out, yet Ling Han felt as if something had entered into his body, probing inch by inch.

“Here, here, and here,” Second Baby said as she examined, pointing at Ling Han’s body.

Ling Han used his divine sense to inspect himself, and with a sweep, he didn’t find any problems. However, after carefully and seriously looking through it several times, he finally discovered that something was amiss.

Hiss, Second Baby’s ability was so awesome.

Ling Han guided his body to increase his level of being, but that was only from the perspective of the overall situation. In the end, it was impossible for him to make any progress. That was why he was not in a hurry to break through after cultivating to the peak of a cultivation level. Instead, he went to polish his foundation, all for the sake of repairing those small details.

With Second Baby’s help, the time he needed to polish his foundation could be infinitely shortened.

He began to fix these small problems. They were really small problems. Some minor flaws could be easily solved. However, without Second Baby’s pointers, he might not be able to find them in a whole lifetime. Then, as his cultivation level increased, small problems might become big problems.

Half a day later, Ling Han reached “perfection.”

He could break through to the Fifth Change.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. Although he had not stayed in the Fourth Change for a long time this time, he had consolidated his cultivation level to an incomparably stable level. He had even resolved all the problems left behind during the Third Change, Second Change, and First Change.

As long as he did not break through to the next major tier, it would not be a problem for him to turn around to cultivate the minor cultivation levels. It would just be a little more difficult, but with Second Baby’s help, it would become a piece of cake again.

However, the problems from the Meridian Opening Tier could not be repaired.

If it was over, it was over, and there was no chance to do it again. However, Ling Han had cultivated to the point where all his Meridian Opening Tier meridians were unblocked, and this could be said to be perfect.

He took out the Long Rainbow Fruits and started to break through to Fifth Change.

Pa, pa, pa! A crisp sound came from his body, as if something had been torn apart.

Bones, muscles, tendons?

‘None of them.’

This was the shackles of his body, preventing him from reaching a higher level.

Ling Han had an epiphany in his heart. Eldest Baby and the others should not have such shackles in their bodies, so as long as their bodies grew, their abilities would naturally increase, and there would be no so-called bottleneck. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This meant by nature, they were superior to others.

Ling Han retracted his thoughts. He would not be jealous, and would only pursue his own strength.

Pa, pa, pa, pa! Streaks of shackles were torn apart, making Ling Han feel both pain and an indescribable sense of relief.

This was an experience that Meridian Opening Tier did not have.

Therefore, strictly speaking, the Meridian Opening Tier couldn’t be considered an increase in level of being, hence there wasn’t much change in lifespan. It wasn’t until he advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier that his level of being experienced a rapid increase. At the same time that his cultivation level increased, his lifespan also increased.

Feeling a wave of weakness, Ling Han consumed the second Long Rainbow Fruit and continued to advance his level of being.

He sat cross-legged firmly, but the sound of his shackles being torn apart was incomparably resounding, like thunder.

“Ah, although Father is a mortal and has a very low starting point, the commotion caused by this breakthrough is really huge,” Eldest Baby said in surprise.

“Otherwise, how could he be our father?” Second Baby said intelligently.

“I really want Daddy to hug me.” The remaining five gourds also sent out divine sense fluctuations.

“Don’t disturb Father!” Eldest Baby said loudly, using the authority of the eldest.

-You were the one who shouted loudly, that’s why you disturbed Father!” The other Calabash Brothers were indignant.

‘If you’re not convinced, come and argue.’

The seven Calabash Brothers began to argue fiercely. It was a mess..
