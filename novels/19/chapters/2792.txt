2793 Boiling sea of blood

Ling Han inquired the anomalies about the Heavenly Venerable Seal.

The anomalies treated him very respectfully. Firstly, it was because Ling Han was the only one who had boldly spoken up to uphold justice for them before, and secondly it was because Ling Han’s battle prowess was top-notch, thereby giving him the qualifications to be on an equal footing with them.

They told him the truth, that this Heavenly Venerable Seal was hidden deep in the ground. In the past, countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates had spilled blood, all of which had flowed to that place. After countless years, that place had experienced changes, and a Heavenly Venerable Seal was birthed.

However, this Heavenly Venerable Seal had yet to come into being at present, while the blood of the Heavenly Venerates was like underground sea; no one could possibly bear the corrosion of so much blood of the Heavenly Venerates, so even if they had been here for countless years, they could only wait quietly.

!!

Recently, the appearance of this Heavenly Venerable Seal was getting more and more frequent; it should be almost time for it to come into being.

“By the way, there are still a few of your people here,” the 12-headed lion suddenly said.

“What?!” Ling Han and the others were shocked.

The six-armed monkey nodded. “That’s right, there were a total of 13 people who were trapped here with us, but at that time, we hadn’t developed intelligence, and were continuously fighting. Dozens of our brothers died, but the other side has also lost nine people.

“It wasn’t until we developed intelligence that the two sides finally stopped fighting, but those four people also didn’t want to stay with us, and were on the other side.”

“Not good!” the anomalies suddenly screamed. “Quickly flee into the corpse pit, and make use of the corpses as cover.”

They didn’t just yell it out like that, but executed this action immediately.

Golden rays dispersed brilliantly as a Heavenly Venerable Seal was on the verge of revealing itself.

Everyone became excited; wasn’t the purpose of their coming here to obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal?

Ling Han intuitively made a prompt decision. “Quick!”

The Empress and the others froze. They hurriedly followed him, got into a corpse pit one after another, and then grabbed the surrounding corpses of Heavenly Venerates to cover themselves.

Most of the others followed suit. After all, judging from the behavior of those anomalies who were so fearful, they were definitely not putting up an act. However, a minority were blinded by greed. They kept staring at the ground, eager to get their hands on the Heavenly Venerable Seal at the first instance.

Once they obtained it, their battle prowess would be greatly improved. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Boom, at this moment, blood oozed from the ground, the surroundings, and the stone walls above their heads, all at the same time. The blood on the ground rose rapidly like a rising tide, while the surrounding walls of the cave seemed to be draining flood waters, causing the rise of turbulent waves.

There was heavy rain coming from above their heads, blood droplets falling down on them.

This scene was absolutely grand, but the Heavenly Venerates who hadn’t found a “bunker” turned pale with fright because such blood rain or blood droplets were terribly corrosive, causing them to suffer heavy injuries in an instant.

“Quickly look for a pile of corpses!” They quickly scattered and fled.

However, it was now too late to find cover. Their skin and flesh were visibly falling off piece after piece, and soon only their skeletons were left. Peng, the skeletons fell into the sea of blood, and their divine sense was also instantly destroyed.

These were basically First Tier Heavenly Venerates, and they were completely unable to withstand such corrosive power.

Although Ling Han and the others were hidden underneath the corpses, they could still sense the situation outside, and their expressions changed drastically.

The corrosive power of this sea of blood was terrifying indeed. It had condensed from the flesh and broken souls of countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. Perhaps only a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate could withstand it by defending with all his strength. However, there was suppression of cultivation level to the Third Tier here, so even if a Fourth Tier or Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate was to take this head-on, it would bring about his demise.

Fortunately, the corpses of Heavenly Venerates could resist the invasion of the sea of blood, causing everyone to feel relieved.

Not long after, the sea of blood began to recede at an extremely fast speed, and the ground was revealed, becoming a huge plain once again.

Ling Han and the others came out from under the corpses, and soon found that those who hadn’t escaped in time were now naturally left with nothing but a cluster of bones and very weak signs of life.

Each was already beyond saving as the remnant soul was on the verge of vanishing, and could only linger for a while.

Everyone sighed. These were Heavenly Venerates, after all. No matter which dimension they were in, they would be outstanding and well-known characters, and yet they died so insignificantly in this place.

“You said, there are people from the Flaming Frost Realm here?” Ling Han brought up the subject matter again. They had just mentioned that there had been four people from the Flaming Frost Realm here, and the sea of blood had begun to boil immediately after that.

The 12-headed lion nodded. “They are on the other side. They were going to pass through the rocky underground. The previous war had destroyed the land here, so those four people of yours then traveled via underground.”

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks. “Let’s go and have a look.”

They came to where there was a fracture in the ground, and groped their way through it.

Their pace wasn’t fast; furthermore, the ground fracture had caused the formation of many forks in the pathway, so they walked for many days before coming out of the crevice in the ground, and they merely saw that there was another plain here, but the area was much smaller.

They looked around, and saw a person standing not far away, but if they looked carefully, they would discover that this wasn’t a person, but a metal statue, with proportions that were exactly the same as a real human.

“Yi, why is there a statue here?” Everyone was surprised.

Generally, statues were built to commemorate somebody. What was the point of building one here?

They walked forwards and came to stand in front of the metal statue.

“Yi, it’s strange!” several people exclaimed, feeling that something was wrong with this metal statue.

Ling Han had the same feeling. As for what was wrong, he was also unable to put his finger on it at this moment.

At this time, the metal statue suddenly moved; the magnitude of his movement was extremely small.

‘Hmm?’

Although the magnitude was extremely small, everyone here was a Heavenly Venerate, after all, so how could they not detect it? Everyone was shocked as they stared at the metal statue.

Ka, the metal statue moved again. This time, the magnitude of the movement was much larger.

First the left hand, then the right hand, and then the feet, and weng, the metal statue opened its eyes, and immediately became “alive.” The metallic gloss faded as it transformed into a living person.

“Finally someone came in!” the “metal statue” said. “After waiting for so many epochs, has the world reopened?”

“Senior!” everyone spoke. The Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates had all been tragically beaten up, and none of them had come down. Therefore, the highest cultivation level here was the Third Tier. Computing based on the time of achieving Dao, they would be the juniors of those Third Tier Heavenly Venerates from the past.

The metal statue vibrated all over, and turned into a young man who seemed to be only in his twenties. His face appeared weathered and marked by vicissitudes. He said, “I am Wu Yufeng, how is the situation now?”

“Senior, we are still fighting against Hysteria,” Geng Xuandan said.

Wu Yufeng nodded, and then let out a long howl, which echoed throughout this small realm.

Not long after, three elites flew over, all exuding an aura marked by vicissitudes of time. One of them had even stepped into the Fourth Tier, but he still only had the battle prowess at the Third Tier under the suppression of the heaven and earth here.

This person was indeed remarkable. In such an environment, he was still able to progress further. Such natural talent in cultivation was terrifying indeed.

“You are Senior Zhuang Feirui!” Shi Mengyu looked at the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and suddenly exclaimed, her eyes shining with astonishing brilliance.

...

The Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate paused slightly, surprised, and said, “I didn’t expect that there are still people who can recognize me.”

He was Zhuang Feirui, the most outstanding genius of his time.
