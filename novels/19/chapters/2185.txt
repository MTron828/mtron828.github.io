Chapter 2186: Troublemaker

Yan Xianlu himself was a Dividing Soul Tier, but he had just advanced to the Yang Soul. Thus, he estimated that Ling Han had to also be either a Yang Soul or Yin Soul, so it was natural that he wouldn’t be too astounded.

Of course, if he knew that not only had Ling Han formed Nine Divided Souls, he was capable of insta-killing even a Third Secret Immortal Palace Tier, the expression on his face would definitely be filled with explosive shock.

Ling Han was quite concerned about the matter of the alliance, and asked, “Brother Yan, just how far has our alliance progressed by now?”

“The flow is good,” Yan Xianlu nodded first, but then he sighed. “However, there are a few troublemakers that are not so easily dealt with. They are not impressed by Yi, nor are they convinced by you, an alliance leader who hasn’t even shown his face before, and are presently rubbing their hands, just waiting to defeat you when you appear so they can snatch the position of the alliance leader.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly. In terms of battle, he had never feared anyone.

“Looks like the only way is to push the rocks up the mountain.”

There were rolling rocks everywhere here, and everyone could easily find one. Then, they would be pushing the rock up the mountain on their ascent.

One step, two steps, and everyone was covered in sweat after only a while, and they all wanted to stop for a rest.

But they were pushing a rock uphill. How could they possibly stop for a rest?

They could either withdraw themselves and step aside, allowing the rock to roll back downhill, but they themselves would also be pushed downhill, or become exhausted and be crushed by the rolling rock. Even if they escaped death, they would still be severely injured. Only by gritting their teeth and forging onwards would they be able to successfully crash through this barrier.

Everyone was aware of this fact, but there were often limits to human power. Once they had surpassed their own limits, their willpower would begin to give in.

Hence, this was a test of willpower.

They continued to climb the mountain, but their progress became slower and slower.

Ling Han continued to cheer the women on. They had gone too long without battle, and their willpower naturally would not be too steady. Only their love for Ling Han was pushing them onwards. And Ling Han was also stirring up their love for him so that they would continue to forge on and stay determined.

There could be a great many reasons for determination, such as a yearning for power, the motivation of revenge, and… love.

The women all forged on determinedly. The level of the Severing Mundane Tier was too important, a dividing line between mortal and immortal. Thus, they had to be able to deliver a strike to the heaven and earth to advance to the Severing Mundane Tier. Otherwise, even if they could become Severing Mundane Tiers, what would be severed would only be their love for Ling Han.

This was something that they would definitely not allow.

Hence, this ignited an incredibly firm belief in them as they used their slender, delicate hands to push the rocks uphill, allowing sweat to soak them, yet still determined not to give up.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be impressed by the power of love.

If it was hatred, one definitely could not possibly hold on for so long, but love was capable of it. Five days, 10 days, and not one of the women gave up. All their eyes were firm and steady, as if they were completely transformed.

Ling Han involuntarily nodded. It was no wonder that one could only leap over the Dragon’s Gate after experiencing so many tests. That was because if they had not experienced this, how could firm willpower be developed, and how then would they be able to become supremely extraordinary geniuses?

A determined person might not be able to become a monarch tier, but those that had become monarch tiers definitely had iron willpower.

A month later, they suddenly felt their hands lighten. Those massive rolling rocks had actually vanished.

They were first stunned, and then realization dawned on them suddenly. As it turned out, they had passed this test.

Instantly, everyone slumped onto the ground, panting heavily.

Their journey here was really too difficult.

Ling Han looked at the women with gratification. Now that they had passed this test, it was as if everyone’s spirits had been reborn.

“However, there are a great many tests still waiting for us.” He raised his head and looked towards the summit, but still could not catch a glimpse of the summit. Who knew how far away it still was.

“That’s right. How has Brother Yan come so quickly here?” Ling Han asked casually.

“Oh, my master deliberately sent me here,” Yan Xianlu said. “However, one can only leap once over the Dragon’s Gate. Multiple times would not have any effect, and my master has leaped over the Dragon’s Gate five epochs ago. Thus, he has only sent me here this time, and has long since returned.”

What a truly good master.

Ling Han nodded. Going by that logic, those Celestial Kings that were older than an epoch had probably already leaped over the Dragon’s Gate, and would not come in and join in on the excitement here. If any Celestial Kings came here, their age would definitely be less than an epoch.

To say anyone could become a Celestial King, yet had not even leaped over the Dragon’s Gate, who would believe it?

Too bad, he had actually wanted to find a few Celestial Kings to beat up.

“Yi, what a coincidence!” Yan Xianlu suddenly stood up, and looked downhill.

Ling Han’s eyes followed his gaze, and saw three young people that were presently pushing a rolling rock upwards each. Though they were all soaked in sweat, all their eyes were extremely bright, their fighting spirit soaring sky-high. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Cheng Zixin, Fu Zhou, He Xinjue,” Yan Xianlu said, turning his head, revealing the names of these three people. “Do you still remember how I said that there are a great many people that are not willing to submit to you as the alliance leader in the alliance?

“These three people are the ones causing the most noise.”

As they spoke, the three people had also passed this test, and walked towards Yan Xianlu.

“Brother Cheng, Brother Fu, Brother He.” Yan Xianlu clasped his hands, and greeted the three of them respectively.

Yet these three people were extremely proud, and were completely aloof.

They did indeed were qualified for it because they were all Earth Souls and monarch tiers as well. They would be able to suppress Yan Xianlu easily.

“Yi, you are…” Cheng Zixin stared at Ling Han. “Brother Fu, Brother He, isn’t this person a little familiar?”

“Hehe, now that you say it, I remember. Isn’t this our Alliance Leader, Ling Han?” Fu Zhou suddenly smiled. They had all seen Ling Han’s memory image before.

“Indeed.” He Xinjue nodded as well.

“Alliance Leader Ling, how about a match?” Fu Zhou asked proudly. Even if there was a restriction to their cultivation levels, he was not afraid. In a battle of equals, even if his opponent was a Celestial King, he was still confident of his victory.

Prodigies were all prideful, and Ling Han could accept that.

He stood up. “Sure, then let’s exchange a few moves.”

“He!” Fu Zhou moved, and launched an attack at Ling Han.

Monarch tiers were monarch tiers. Even if their cultivation level had been restricted to the Mountain River Tier, his battle prowess still far surpassed that. His incredibly domineering punch shot forth.

Ling Han parried the blow casually.?Peng, Fu Zhou’s punch had landed on the palm of his hand, yet did not cause the slightest sound, as if all of its force had been swallowed up.

“En?” Fu Zhou showed a hint of surprise. “Not bad, you do have some strength.”

Meanwhile, Ling Han shook his arm lightly, and sent Fu Zhou backwards. Then, he pointed a finger at Cheng Zixin and He Xinjue. “The two of you can fight me together!”

He Xinjue and Cheng Zixin exchanged a look, and both erupted into laughter.

“We have never had the habit of joining forces.”

“Nor is there any need for it!”

They each quipped.

Fu Zhou, meanwhile, was furious. With himself as the opponent, Ling Han actually dared to challenge Cheng Zixin and He Xinjue at the same time. Just how much was he belittling him?!

“You are truly arrogant!” He leaped back, and shot out another punch at Ling Han.

Ling Han paid him no regard, but instead charged towards Cheng Zixin and He Xinjue. He, too, shot out a fist, which turned into two punches that blasted towards the duo.

“Damn it!”

Both were enraged. They naturally disdained joining forces with another, but they could not bear such provocation from Ling Han, either. They both roared furiously, and countered respectively.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The three of them were instantly entangled in battle.

Ling Han was confident he would be able to subdue these three people within 100 moves if there hadn’t been restrictions on his cultivation level, even if he had still been an Earth Soul, and had not formed Nine Divided Souls, but now that his cultivation level had been suppressed to the Mountain River Tier, his advantage in battle prowess had also been endlessly reduced, so he could only battle Cheng Zixin and the others to a tie.

However, Cheng Zixin and the others were shocked to death.
