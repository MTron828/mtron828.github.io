Chapter 1662: Natural Psychic Fruit

Ling Han’s present strength was enough to overwhelm everything else.

Actually, he did not like to kill, so every time they arrived at a new place, he would first ask for passage. If the other side was polite, then everything would be fine, but if the other was determined to make things difficult for them, then he would not be polite, either.

Wasn’t it just killing people? Did they think he didn’t know how to do it?

When he had wiped out the elites of another two tribes, all the tribes upstream and downstream were intimidated. Anywhere he went, they were all incredibly respectful, and dared not speak of any “Destroyer”.

Ling Han did nothing, either. These tribes could not leave the Mystery Realm, and would not create any trouble for the Ancient Realm, so there was no need for him to eliminate all of them.

Finally, they had traveled to the last tribe, the Tian Tribe, and the part ahead of them was close to the source of the great river.

Yet it was practically a dead end ahead of them.

The further upstream they went, the more essence of power there was contained in the river waters, but the more frightening the destructive power of these waters correspondingly was. As they walked further, large waves slammed into the banks. If only the slightest drop of river water from the splashes made contact, even Nine Rings elites would be annihilated.

Thus, even the strongest Tian Tribe did not dare to go further upstream. Otherwise, that would only be seeking their own demise.

And here, Ling Han finally met some familiar faces.

...There were a few young king tiers from the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy here, but they were not Ren Feiyun and the other big shots, and were instead rank three king tiers. Clearly, there was a limited number that the Star Sand Saint could protect, so if he were to bring anyone, he would bring those with greatest potential rather than those whose present cultivation levels were highest.

Ling Han spotted Hong Ma, the Second in the World, and Zi Chenfeng, and there were also a few prodigies from the Forbidden Lands. They totalled up to over 60 people.

“Senior Brother Ling!”

When these people spotted Ling Han, they all hurriedly paid their greetings. They did not know that Ling Han had become a Great Saint, and his battle prowess was enough to overwhelm all Saints. Otherwise, even if they were old acquaintances with Ling Han, they would not dare to treat him as a peer.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Where are the others?”

“Still in the fatal land ahead,” someone said.

Ling Han asked them closely, and found out that ahead of the Tian Tribe, the great river was incredibly frightening, and even the surrounding land had become filled with killing intent, but it was in this land that a Celestial medicine had appeared!

Celestial medicine!

Natural Psychic Fruit.

Even in the Celestial Realm, this was definitely a supremely precious medicine. Once one consumed such a Celestial medicine, his physique could resonate with the heaven and earth, and form the legendary Dao physique.

What kind of benefits did that have?

With resonance with the heaven and earth, he himself could be claimed to be the embodiment of the Regulations, so there would be no bottleneck in his cultivation. He only needed to complete the accumulation of power, and his advancement through the cultivation levels would be irresistible.

Naturally, because the Natural Psychic Fruit had different ages, this irresistible and forceful advancement rate was also limited. Some could only reach the Severing Mundane Tier, while some could reach the Dividing Soul Tier, and some could reach the Immortal Palace Tier.

It was said that the oldest Natural Psychic Fruit could help one advance to the Ascending Origin Tier, but it was never said that it could help one advance to the Celestial King Tier.

But that was already enough. Celestials had an unlimited lifespan, so as long as there was no barrier in their comprehension of cultivation level, how many years would accumulation of power take?

The Empress, the Saint Kings of the Forbidden Lands, and the others were all looking into how to enter that fatal land to obtain that Celestial medicine, and the Tian Tribe had attempted it for who knew how many generations, so they had long since given up. Of course, if the Empress and the others managed to successfully obtain it, they would definitely move to snatch it from them.

At present, there was no conflict of interest, and the Tian Tribe did not want to become hostile with so many elites, either, so they allowed them to temporarily reside here. In any case, they had different cultivation systems, so there was no need to worry that these outsiders would take their resources from them.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then decided to immediately head to that fatal land for a look. So many years had passed, and he dearly missed his wife. Of course, he missed his brother as well.

He set out with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others, and Zi Chenfeng volunteered to lead the way for them.

On the way, Zi Chenfeng seemed like he wanted to say something but was hesitating, looking like he was constipated.

Ling Han couldn’t bear it any longer, and asked, “Do you want to say something?”

“Senior Brother Ling, there is something that I have to tell you, but you must definitely restrain yourself,” Zi Chenfeng said.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded carelessly. Actually, there was nothing much that he had to be angry about. If there was anything displeasing to him, he would just directly crush it. In front of absolute power, was there any matter that could not be resolved?

Zi Chenfeng nodded, and said, “When we entered this place, we also encountered a very young elite. He has already cultivated to the peak stage of Saint King Tier, and even those lords were incredibly polite towards him.”

He paused, and said, “That young Saint King seems to admire Senior Sister Luan Xing very much.”

Ling Han laughed in spite of himself. This guy feared that he would get jealous, and pick a fight with that young Saint King?

The Empress’s charms were irresistible. Ling Han had long since learnt self-restraint. Otherwise, if he would get jealous every single time someone looked at his wife, then wouldn’t he be dead from jealousy? He naturally had absolute trust in the Empress. No matter how many or how outstanding her pursuers were, it would be completely useless.

Of course, admiring was their own business, but if someone still insisted on shamelessly pestering her even after rejection, then he would definitely not be polite.

“Got it,” Ling Han stated, completely not taking the matter to heart.

Xiao Gu was restless. After meeting “fresh” people, its urge to imitate speech could not be held back. However, it recalled that Ling Han had said that imitating others was not good, so it forcefully suppressed the urge, but felt extraordinarily uncomfortable doing so.

Half a day later, they finally approached that fatal land. True enough, they had not even reached the place, but they could already feel a harsh air rush out towards them, making everyone feel as if there were knives slicing at their faces.

Zi Chenfeng immediately stopped, and said, “Senior Brother Ling, this is already my limit. I cannot take another step further.”

He was also considerably extraordinary, and the five years he had spent here had greatly improved his cultivation level. He’d advanced into the peak of the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Even with such a cultivation level, he could still walk until this place. As expected of a king tier.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s all right!”

He set up a shield of Origin Power, and protected Zi Chenfeng—previously, he had not used Origin Power at all, and was only using his physique itself to resist, yet it was sturdier than the defense of any Saint King.

Zi Chenfeng was incredibly stunned. He looked dumbly at Ling Han. This feat was something that even many Saint Kings were unable to accomplish; they would only be able to set up a shield that would allow their own advance. Thus, he had completely no idea what was ahead of them all this while.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han did not only put up a defense for Zi Chenfeng. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint were not exempted, either. As for Xiao Gu, there was no need for him to worry. This guy was incredibly strange.

The four of them walked ahead, with Xiao Gu bringing up the rear. It gazed around, its head slanted to one side. Occasionally, green light would be flickering in its eyes, as if there was something here that had incited a reaction from it.

After slightly less than an hour’s walk, they could finally see that there were more than 30 people ahead of them.

The Empress!

Ling Han spotted her with a single glance. Wherever she was, the Empress would be the most dazzling and outstanding, as if the moon surrounded by the stars, or the rising sun that lit up the dark night.

The Empress stood proudly. Without Ling Han there, she was the proudest and most austere person, but it was this bearing that was so attractive to others. They were willing to yield under her feet, willing to surrender their all for her.

There was a young man standing at her side, only three feet away, and the other Saints, including the Star Sand Saint, were around nine meters away. Thus, even though the two of them were obviously not standing very close to each other, they seemed like a pair.

As if she had sensed his presence, the Empress suddenly turned around. Suddenly, an overjoyed smile appeared on her exquisite face. With a leap, she pounced into Ling Han’s arms.

The young man standing at her side immediately revealed a menacing expression.
