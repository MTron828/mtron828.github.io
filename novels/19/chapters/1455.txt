Chapter 1456 Borrowing a Dragon Horn

King tiers liked to battle, yet this was simply because they yearned to prove their strength.

In this valley, the most important task was obviously to reach the gigantic golden boulder that hovered above the valley. Doing so would also be the best method to prove one’s strength. Ever since this valley had come into existence, there had always been someone who had achieved first place. However, none of the victors had ever managed to ascend the gigantic golden boulder.

Ascending this boulder would be writing a new page into history. Perhaps doing so would also allow the victor to write a glorious new chapter that belonged to themself!

The king tiers were all firm believers of luck and fortune. There existed an intangible will of heaven, and each generation would see the birth of its own leader, someone who would lead the might of heaven and earth and rule over the entire generation. In this area of the universe, the ruler was currently the Star Sand Saint. Although he wasn’t a Saint King, he was peerless and invincible throughout all of the surrounding galaxies, and his status and influence were as if he were an actual Saint King.

Now that they were ushering in a golden age of cultivation, where prodigies were appearing all over the place, the role of luck and fortune was becoming even more important.

Which of these supreme king tiers wasn’t a top-notch prodigy? In fact, there was even someone like Gu Daoyi, a prodigy who possessed a Divine Fetus. However, among them, only one could emerge as the victor who eventually occupied the throne and ruled over the world.

How could one break away from the pack and ascend this throne? Through luck and fortune!

The victor would see their fortune rise, while the losers would see their fortune wane. This was an intangible process, yet its effects would become increasingly obvious with the passage of time. One who possessed great fortune would meet no resistance when entering ancient sites, also being able to obtain rare treasures. Meanwhile, those who possessed waning fortunes would come across perilous dangers with every step, and yet still fail to find any worthwhile treasures.

As this effect showed itself over time, the gap between the king tiers would naturally grow larger and larger.

Thus, even though ascending the gigantic golden boulder might not bring them any extra benefits, Ling Han, Long Xiangyue, and the others all unleashed their full power to surge toward it.

If they defeated all of the fellow king tiers of their generation, they would be crowned as the victor and the king. This was a battle over fortune. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In order to achieve victory, they would naturally unleash all of their trump cards!

Long Xiangyue slashed with her sword at Ling Han, sword light soaring into the sky as countless divine patterns blossomed. In fact, there were even the roars of dragons reverberating through heaven and earth. This was an astonishing attack.

Ling Han unleashed the Tide of the Ages, easily blocking her strike. Apart from the secret techniques of celestial king tiers like Gu Daoyi, there were few Immortal Realm secret techniques that the Tide of the Ages couldn’t deal with.

The Tide of the Ages would only struggle if its opponent were a descendant of an ancient tribe and also possessed the bloodline of the Celestial Realm. If one’s celestial bloodline were extremely pure, the celestial techniques that they could wield would naturally be incredibly mighty as well.

The attack that was targeting Ling Han—it was actually targeting the gigantic golden boulder, to be more precise—was instantly aged. Meanwhile, Ling Han possessed a freakish physique, so he genuinely didn’t care too much about whether or not he was hit.

In fact, he wore an eager expression as he looked at Long Xiangyue, asking, “Are you a descendent of a True Dragon?”

Long Xiangyue faltered momentarily. Why was he suddenly asking this during battle? She humphed before replying, “What’s it have to do with you?”

“It’s got everything to do with me!” Ling Han said seriously. “If you’re the descendant of a True Dragon, can you gift me a dragon horn when you reach the Genesis Tier?” He still remembered his deal with the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire. Using the horn of a True Dragon and the feather of a True Phoenix, he would be able to exchange for a secret technique from the Heavenly Emperor.

Thinking about it now, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was definitely an elite from the Celestial Realm. However, how had he managed to descend into the Lower Realm?

Hu Niu, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, and also the Black Tower... All of these people and items that had once belonged to the Celestial Realm had somehow appeared in the same small world all at once. Regardless of how one thought about this, it was far too strange to be a coincidence.

Thus, Ling Han was extremely proactive in trying to gather the four items from the Divine Beasts and exchanging them for the celestial technique, Immovable Deity Metal Body.

“In your dreams!” Long Xiangyue shouted, her expression changing drastically. It was as if she had just suffered great humiliation. She slashed with her sword again, her attacks becoming even wilder and more ferocious than before. Moreover, while she had been attacking the floating rock beneath Ling Han’s feet just then, she was now focusing her attacks on his body.

Although the effects of shattering the floating rock or defeating Ling Han would be the same, seeing Long Xiangyue grit her teeth as her face flushed a fiery red told Ling Han that things weren’t as simple as he thought.

‘Strange, I’m only asking for a single dragon horn. In any case, you can regrow your dragon horn after I take one. Is there any need to become so worked up? It’s not like I’m asking for your chastity or something.’

“Little Han, to the Dragon Tribe, their horns are a token of love. By asking her for a dragon horn, are you trying to get in bed with her?” The large black dog charged over at this moment, stopping around 18 meters away from Ling Han.

‘Hah? Is that so?

‘No wonder Long Xiangyue became so worked up and enraged. In fact, why has Helian Xun Xue never gifted me a dragon horn before? Is it because she was raised in the small world, where there’s no such custom?’

“Despicable dog!” Long Xiangyue spat through gritted teeth. She suddenly turned to slash her sword at the large black dog. His explanation had been vulgar and uncouth, and it had simply added fuel to the fire.

However, there were peculiar restrictions in this valley, so the sword light from her sword came to a sudden halt after shooting forward for a distance of six meters. It then mysteriously disappeared.

The large black dog stood up like a human, a degenerate expression on his face as he said, “It’s not Grandpa Dog that wants to bed you; it’s that brat over there. Why are you taking your anger out on me? In any case, I happen to be missing some human pets, so I’m not against accepting you as my steed, even though you’re the descendant of a True Dragon.”

“Aaah...!” Long Xiangyue was wild with fury. Although she knew it was useless, she still launched a flurry of angry attacks toward the large black dog.

The large black dog clasped his front claws behind his back, saying, “Your attacks are like the mere glow of fireflies before the brilliant moon; they’re insignificant before me!” Right now, it was as if he were obliterating Long Xiangyue’s attacks before they could even near him. He was flexing wantonly and shamelessly.

In fact, even Ling Han could barely bring himself to watch on. This large black dog was far too experienced in pissing people off.

“Die!” However, in the next instant, Long Xiangyue had already swiveled back around to attack him. There was a frosty expression on her beautiful face, and it was clear that she was using him to vent her feelings of humiliation and rage.

‘F*ck! That despicable dog!’

Ling Han instantly unleashed heaven’s might. So what if Long Xiangyue was unleashing the rage of a True Dragon? Her powerful aura was instantly reflected away before it could even reach him. At the same time, the devastating effects of heaven’s might forcefully suppressed her power by two entire stars.

“Hmm?!” Long Xiangyue immediately yelped in astonishment. She hadn’t expected for her power to suddenly drop by two stars. She was completely unprepared for this, and thus even a king tier like her was momentarily flustered.

Ling Han seized this opportunity and immediately slashed forward with his sword, instantly pushing Long Xiangyue off her floating rock.

With her power weakened one-hundred-fold, in addition to her emotions of fury and her flustered state, Long Xiangyue naturally couldn’t unleash much of her power at this moment. She was defeated by Ling Han in a single strike.

The floating rock beneath Ling Han’s feet absorbed Long Xiangyue’s floating rock, allowing him to instantly ascend another six meters.

If he absorbed one more floating rock, he would be able to ascend the gigantic golden boulder. Meanwhile, looking at the hourglass... there were still six hours remaining.

‘That’s more than enough time!’

Right at this moment, Zi Chenfeng, Second in the World, and Hong Ma almost all charged up at the same time. They had defeated the Rain Emperor, Cheng Xiaofan, and a host of other supreme king tiers to reach this level. Right now, it was time for the final battle.

It was evident that someone would definitely ascend the gigantic golden boulder this time. However, which of them would it be?

Each of the four supreme king tiers had a chance!

However, they didn’t engage in battle straight away. This was because they were all wary of becoming the target of the three other king tiers. If that occurred, it was very likely that the targeted king tier would be defeated, regardless of how powerful they were.

Below them, the Rain Emperor, Cheng Xiaofan, Long Xiangyue, and the other king tiers that had been defeated were all charging back up at an astonishing pace. Once they reached this height again, they would add even more uncertainty to the battle.

Ling Han and the three other king tiers all gazed at each other. Then, they all suddenly launched into action.

None of them formed an alliance with another. Instead, they were engaged in an all-out melee.

As long as one of them was defeated, someone else would be able to snatch their floating rock and ascend to the peak!

This was the final battle.

There was no time to waste, and they all charged toward their opponents.

The four king tiers unleashed their most powerful attacks at each other. They didn’t care whom they defeated first, as long as someone was defeated.
