3028 Overwhelming victory

Jiang Yuefeng chuckled and pointed at himself. “It’s my turn now, right?”

He was incomparably flamboyant as he clapped, and said, “Everyone, everyone, aren’t you going to welcome the most handsome man in history with a warm applause?

“Hmm, you don’t seem very happy?” Jiang Yuefeng looked at Lan Ruoping. “Sigh, seeing such a handsome man, you’re actually not surprised at all. I’m really disappointed.”

Lan Ruoping looked at him coldly, and said, “Cut the crap and make your move!”

He was extremely conceited. He clearly knew that Yun Yongwang and the others had the ability to crush their peers, but he was still full of confidence in himself.

“Sigh, you’re really such a boor,” Jiang Yuefeng said with a smile. He shook his head. “Why don’t we sit down, drink some tea, and have a chat?”

Lan Ruoping was taken aback. He didn’t expect that it wasn’t just the ginseng and dog demons[1] who had such despicable mouths. This human being was actually the same.

He charged over. “Die!”

Boom, he summoned an ancient mirror. It floated above his head, emitting terrifying light.

Jiang Yuefeng was fearless, and took initiative to charge forward.

Boom! Boom! Boom! The two of them clashed with all their might.

Lan Ruoping was extremely conceited as he indeed possessed true ability. His battle prowess was incomparably astonishing, and he might have reached the heights of the Eighth Heaven.

This was because he possessed extremely strong natural talent in martial arts, which allowed his battle prowess to almost reach the next cultivation level.

Jiang Yuefeng, on the other hand, was different. Originally, he might not even have been able to reach the Heavenly Body Tier, but now he had reached the level of Seventh Heaven. His potential had long since been exhausted. It was only because of Ling Han that he was able to break through his limits again and again.

However, he had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, and thus both his battle prowess and defense far surpassed those of his peers.

Therefore, his battle prowess was not at all inferior to Lan Ruoping’s.

However, Jiang Yuefeng also had an advantage in terms of defense. His physical body was indestructible, which wasn’t something that Lan Ruoping could break through at all.

This allowed Jiang Yuefeng to be invincible. He could do whatever he wanted, and all he needed to do was focus on attacking.

The more Lan Ruoping fought, the more sullen he felt. He was clearly more outstanding than Jiang Yuefeng, but because Jiang Yuefeng had cultivated some kind of secret technique, his battle prowess had been amplified by more than 100 times, which was enough to let him compete against him.

Moreover, Jiang Yuefeng’s defense was almost invincible under the protection of another secret technique. Even after more than 10 attacks, he could only open a small wound on his opponent’s body. How could he severely injure his opponent like this?

Such a battle was too unfair.

Lan Ruoping was filled with resentment. The other party definitely had a powerful master who was able to teach him such a wonderful technique.

Hence, he was extremely unwilling to accept such fate.

But so what? No matter how unwilling he was, it couldn’t possibly increase his battle prowess. It would only cause him to be affected by his emotions, which would in turn weaken his battle prowess.

The scales of victory kept tilting in Jiang Yuefeng’s favor, and it would only be a matter of time before Lan Ruoping suffered defeat.

Sure enough, after another several hundred moves, Lan Ruoping was struck by Jiang Yuefeng’s punch. He vomited blood continuously and was defeated.

He had made a bold claim earlier, but now that he had been defeated by Jiang Yuefeng of the same cultivation level, he naturally couldn’t live down this humiliation. He immediately turned around and left, not returning to the place of enlightenment.

It was just that no one knew if he was putting on an act, or if he would really never come back again.

Jiang Yuefeng chuckled and bowed to everyone. “Good battle, thanks for the win. I’m indeed the most handsome, making other people feel inferior and ashamed.”

“Humph, you guys are really bold!” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King spoke up. He looked extremely young, and his flame of life had only burned for tens of billions of years at most, yet he had already advanced into the Ninth Heaven. His rate of advancement could be said to progress at breakneck speed.

“You must have gone mad trying to be famous, to even dare to cause trouble in Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s place of enlightenment!” This young Ninth Heaven Celestial King walked out in large strides. Boom, he clearly didn’t use any power, but with a single step, the heavens and earth shook, as if even the heavens were afraid of him.

Ding Ping walked out, and asked indifferently, “Who are you?”

“I’m Shi Yuan,” the Ninth Heaven Celestial King said. “My father is… Heavenly Venerate Flawless!”

Heavenly Venerate Flawless?

Ding Ping nodded, and immediately recalled that Heavenly Venerate Flawless was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate elite. No wonder he could nurture such a “young” Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

However, it was clear that Shi Yuan was unlikely to advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, which was why he had come here, hoping that the Seventh Tier ultimate elite could help him take this incomparably crucial step.

Only after becoming a Heavenly Venerate could one truly be considered one of the strongest in the world.

“All of you ought to be descendants of Heavenly Venerates, right?” Shi Yuan continued. When these words were spoken, it instantly caused the nearby Celestial Kings to let out an “oh” in unison, appearing to be extremely shocked.

…Most of the people here didn’t have Heavenly Venerable-Tier backgrounds, so even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate was someone they had to look up to.

They were merely apprentices of the place of enlightenment, and not even the personal disciples of Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, so how could they dare to casually offend a Heavenly Venerate?

“So what if we are or aren’t?” Ding Ping said indifferently.

“Hehe, actually, this doesn’t have much to do with anything.” Shi Yuan still looked very arrogant. “It’s just that to my observation, all of you seem to have grasped Heavenly Venerate Techniques, so I just wanted to get a confirmation.”

He clenched his fists and shook them lightly. Instantly, a dazzling light surged.

“In front of me, all of your backgrounds are useless!” he said proudly.

“Then let’s battle!” Ding Ping’s fighting spirit was also raging. In front of his master, he couldn’t let his morale fall.

Boom! Shi Yuan charged over. He threw a punch, and supreme Regulations wrapped around his fist. Under the level of Regulations, the strike was unmatched.

Ding Ping was unafraid, and he also brandished his fist to meet the attack.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them continued to exchange blows, both of them filled with confidence in their own strength, wanting to defeat the other party head-on.

“Master, Senior Brother Ding wouldn’t lose, right?” asked Jiuyao from the side. The battle situation was extremely intense now, and he couldn’t see who had gained the upper hand.

“Don’t worry,” the large black dog said quickly. “Little Ping is naturally blessed with pure brute force. Being on the same cultivation level, and yet trying to compete with him in strength? Moreover, he has cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so he’s most suitable for such a tough head-on battle. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That Yuan, or whatever his name, is just putting on a brave front. Grandpa Dog assures you that he definitely won’t be able to last more than 100 moves.”

Jiuyao nodded. The large black dog was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so how could he be wrong?

As expected, Shi Yuan retreated in a miserable state after only 80 moves, his face flushed red.

His arms hung down in a very strange form. That was because the bones in his arms had already been completely shattered. It was just that he had previously insisted on saving face, and forcefully used his Source Power to condense the broken bones, thinking that Ding Ping was the same as him.

Now, he finally couldn’t hold on any longer, and was immediately defeated.

Ding Ping was very polite. He cupped his fists, and said, “Good battle.”

The old ginseng jumped out to mock them again. “Is there anyone who can fight? Is there still anyone who can fight?”

All the Celestial Kings remained silent. Ding Ping was too powerful, and those below the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier were naturally no match for him. Moreover, even for a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier elite, who could guarantee that he would be a match for Ding Ping?

The old ginseng laughed heartily. “What bullsh*t Heavenly Venerate, raising a bunch of useless trash. Hurry up and tear down the signboard!”
