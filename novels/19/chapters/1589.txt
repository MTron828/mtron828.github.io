Chapter 1590: Fighting a Heaven Demon

Not a single big shot spoke up in objection to it.

Which one of them would fear Ling Han? They merely did not want him to hide in that Celestial Tool. Now, since Ling Han wanted to fight, that was equivalent to giving them an opening, allowing them to easily apprehend him.

Ouyang Taishan, meanwhile, frowned slightly, but since Ling Han had proposed this, then he naturally had his own reasons, so he did not stop him.

The Mystery Realm opened up. If the grand elder of the Tan Clan really became serious, the restrictions in this place would not be able to bear his full power. Thus, this battle naturally had to be commenced in the galaxy.

This was an empty space that was far away from the sun. Thus, this was an area of complete darkness, filled with dead silence. And in this dead silence, Ling Han and the grand elder of the Tan Clan stood, facing one another, a distance of about 10 miles between them.

“Brat, are you sure you will not hide?” The grand elder of the Tan Clan asked calmly. He was using his words to spur Ling Han on. What if the latter suddenly ducked into the Celestial Tool again? He would be able to do nothing.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “You’re just an old wretch I will be able to easily kill with a flip of my hand, what’s the point of spouting so much nonsense!”

“Damn brat!” The white brow of the grand elder of the Tan Clan rose, and he showed a strong killing intent.

He suddenly moved. Weng, a giant palm of fire grabbed out towards Ling Han, endless seals throbbing within the flames. This was the embodiment of the strongest Regulations of the Netherworld.

“Small Tower,” Ling Han said softly in his mind.

Weng, endless power suddenly surged from his body, and his aura abruptly spiked a few hundred million times, thousands of millions times over. In that one moment, he felt that he had become omnipotent. He could create a hole in the heavens themselves with a single palm strike, and would be able to obliterate all life with a single thought.

The large hand grabbed out at him, and Ling Han shot out a fist to greet the incoming attack.

When the Demon Masters saw this, they were all surprised. Ling Han really dared to fight the grand elder of the Tan Clan. This was definitely attempting the impossible.

“Yi, I feel like that brat’s power has spiked an innumerable number of times.”

“That’s right; he seems capable of even standing against me.”

“This is inconceivable!”

In front of their shocked eyes, Ling Han’s punch shot out, and that palm from the grand elder of the Tan Clan was instantly rended into pieces.

‘This...!’

Even if those Heaven Demons previously had expected this, they were still so shocked by this scene that they did not dare to believe what they were seeing with their own eyes.

Had this brat ingested a Celestial Pill? How could it be possible that he had become so many times stronger in a single instant?

It had to be the secret technique of the Celestial King!

The eyes of the grand elder of the Tan Clan widened slightly. This result had also far surpassed his expectation. He humphed, and said, “No wonder you had the courage to oppose me, so it seems that you have the backing of a Celestial King secret technique!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He couldn’t help but be incredibly envious. This kind of secret technique allowed Ling Han to directly leap from the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier to the peak stage of the Heaven Demon. If it was his, then just how much stronger would he become?

Would he then be able to directly tear a rip into space and enter into the Celestial Realm?

With this thought, his greed went out of control.

What strong power!

Ling Han stretched out his limbs, and was a little infatuated with this feeling of power. Too bad, this presently did not belong to him, but he believed he would possess such strength in the foreseeable future.

“Old geezer, I will send you on your way!” He rushed up with his bare hands, but at present, his power was too strong. He was the only person in the whole Netherworld that could grasp the Regulations of the two Realms at the same time, and this kind of strength would be able to overwhelm any Demon Master or Saint King.

In the galaxy, the two elites battled fiercely, but there was no doubt about it. The grand elder of the Tan Clan was completely being suppressed, and was absolutely at a disadvantage.

“This brat is actually strong to this extent!”

“This is inconceivable!”

“Though Old Geezer Tan is not the strongest among peak stage Demon Masters, it is enough to rank him in around the top 10.”

“If anyone was able to suppress Old Geezer Tan like this, it would probably only be the two or three people whose battle prowess is the strongest.”

“However, it is definitely impossible that such strength could be maintained constantly, or the hierarchy would have lost its meaning of existence.”

“When this brat’s strength is completely expended, we can attack together when he least expects it, and apprehend him with a single move.”

The big shots were all communicating through their divine senses. Aside from the limited few that were comprised of Ouyang Taishan and his companions, all of them were eyeing Ling Han covetously. It couldn’t be helped; who would not be tempted by a Celestial King technique? Even Ouyang Taishan was tempted, but he had stronger principles.

“Not good, Old Geezer Tan is close to his limit!”

“Attack together!”

Another several hundred moves later, the grand elder of the Tan Clan was already in a perilous situation, and it was possible that he would be heavily injured at any time. This caused all the big shots to become restless, and they all made their move, intending to suppress Ling Han.

“Humph, you all are too shameless!” Ouyang Taishan also made his move, but his attack was not directed at Ling Han. Instead, he was directing his attack at his erstwhile allies. “Ling Han, don’t be brave for this moment only to regret it later; leave quickly!”

He could guess that this strength of Ling Han was definitely only momentary. Otherwise, the hierarchy of cultivation would have lost its meaning.

But those two big shots that had been with Ouyang Taishan did not make a move; they chose to stand by and watch—to them, not attacking was already giving face to Ouyang Taishan.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and saw the expressions on all their faces. This would decide how he would deal with these people in future.

“Old geezers, are you guys tired of living?” he asked darkly.

“Brat, there is no way you will be able to escape! Hand over the Celestial King technique, and we can spare your life!” the Heaven Demon of the Ye Clan called out loudly, but his punch had already arrived without any reservations.

There was no need to leave him alive; they only needed to pluck out his soul. Furthermore, they would only be able to trust him completely through plucking out his soul. In a matter that concerned the Celestial King technique, who would believe Ling Han’s words? What if there was the slightest mistake in the celestial technique? Then the result of cultivating it could possibly be being driven mad, and completely burnt to nothing by great dao.

“Since that is the case, I will send you all on your way!” Ling Han emitted a battle cry. This time, he would not hold anything back.

Indeed, he had not done his best previously. Otherwise, how could it be that the grand elder of the Tan Clan would be able to hold up for so many moves?

He wanted to see the choice that every person made, and that was why he had deliberately drawn things out.

And now, he was about to start a massacre.

“Die!” With a tremor from his hands, his left hand held the broken wooden sword, while his right hand gripped the Divine Demon Sword, and he charged out towards the Heaven Demons. Shua, shua, shua, Sword Qi danced unhindered. Weng, the two Divine Swords were completely activated, multiple seals appearing on them, releasing brilliant light. They were drawing on great dao, and were incredibly powerful.

At this time, the broken wooden sword was stronger.

This was a Level 20 Demonic Tool, and with Ling Han’s present power, he could completely activate its full might. On the other hand, the Divine Demon Sword was only Level 17 at present, so its might was considerably weaker.

However, if the Divine Demon Sword hit any of their vital points, even Severing Mundane Ancestors would die, what more Heaven Demons. This was a future Celestial Tool; its destructive power was definitely impressive.

Ling Han was like a fierce tiger that had charged into a flock of sheep. As he brandished the two Divine Swords, there was no one that could face him head-on. They all fled in all directions.

“Darkness of the Paramount Night!” Ling Han channeled the celestial technique. Hong, endless darkness spread out, enshrouding all the Demon Masters.

Going along with Ling Han’s burst of cultivation level, the might of Darkness of the Paramount Night was naturally also boosted, and had strong effects even on Heaven Demons.

The Lightning Sword Technique was used. Ling Han did not need to care about whom he was currently facing; there was only one word for it: kill!
