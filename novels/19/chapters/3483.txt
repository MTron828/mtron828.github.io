Chapter 3484* Battle an Enlightenment Tier

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “So what if you’re an Enlightenment Tier elite?”

“Brat, have you gone stupid?” A young man couldn’t help but jump out and shout, “You are only Extreme Bone Tier. No matter how freakish you are, how could you be a match for Enlightenment Tier?”

“This brat got the first place in the Young Dragon Trial. He thinks too highly of himself, and thinks that he is invincible in this world?”

“Hehe, that’s possible!”

“Today, I will let him know the consequences of arrogance!”

The four youngsters all called out, extremely arrogant.

Ling Han looked at them, and said, “Do you guys only know how to bark like dogs? Come, I’ll suppress you with a single move. If I need to use one more move than that, I’ll admit defeat.”

Two young men immediately looked indignant, and couldn’t help but want to rush out, but were stopped by the other two.

“Don’t drop down to his level.”

He s about to die, so what need is there to be concerned about what he says?” With this persuasion, the two rash young men both calmed down.

The middle-aged man didn’t care about this. He stared at Ling Han, and said coldly, “Hand over all your treasures and cultivation techniques, then swear to join our Ma Clan, and I can make an exception and spare your life.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself, and said, “You want to rob me of all my fated opportunities, and want me to become your servant, and I still have to thank you?”

“Brat, if you lose your life, what chance, what pride, what meaning is there left?” The middle-aged man said indifferently. His name was Ma Lirong.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Since you’ve said so… come, this is a robbery. Hand over all your valuables, then castrate yourselves, and I can spare your lives.” Ma Lirong’s expression darkened. He had really never seen someone as ungrateful as Ling Han. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He had already said that he would already make an exception and spare Ling Han’s life, yet Ling Han actually still dared to argue with him.

He was really tired of living.

“You’re seeking death!” He strode out. Boom, the power in his body surged, and his bones crackled. The inscribed patterns on his organs lit up, and the apertures all over his body were also exuding light like stars.

This was an elite of Enlightenment Tier. Originally, on Celestial Sea Planet, he was a top-notch existence, but now, it was as if this kind of elite had spilled all over the place.

Ling Han crossed his arms over his chest, appearing disdainful.

Ma Lirong was furious, and tapped out a finger. Pu, a gust of wind shot out, shooting towards Ling Han.

Ling Han leaned to the side, and the wind from his finger instantly swept past him.

Once an Enlightenment Tier elite becomes serious, how can you dodge?” Ma Lirong sneered. He spread open the five fingers of his right hand and delivered a palm strike at Ling Han. This time, it was terrifying. The force turned into a ball of energy the size of a manhole cover.

Ling Han clenched his hand into a fist, and greeted this attack with a wave of his hand.

Peng!

In the exchange of blows, he stumbled and retreated continuously, but this

blow from Ma Lirong was also neutralized by him.

Ling Han was very dissatisfied. The other was only in the middle stage of Enlightenment Tier, but in terms of raw power, he was still no match.

Battle prowess being comparable to the middle stage of the Enlightenment Tier, and power being comparable to the middle stage of the Enlightenment Tier. These were two completely different concepts.

However, Ma Lirong’s hair stood on end, feeling an indescribable terror.

What was going on here? An Extreme Bone Tier was actually capable of just barely matching him?

This was a huge gap of two major cultivation levels.

How could this be!

It was not just him. Those four young men also seemed to have suddenly been struck by a staff, and were all stunned.

“Seventh Uncle must not have used his full strength.” After a while, a young man forced himself to speak, attempting to explain.

“That’s right. Seventh Uncle must have gone easy on him.”

“It can’t be helped. The opponent is too weak. If he were to directly beat him to death, how would he be supposed to interrogate him for the cultivation technique?”

The others also said, one after another, and even laughed, pretending to be calm.

Ma Lirong also took a deep breath, suppressed the shock in his heart, and said, “Ling Han, I only used 10% of my power in that attack just now. So, if you know what’s good for you, obediently hand over the cultivation technique and treasure, and don’t ruin yourself!”

Ling Han cracked a smile, “Is that so? Then I’m really sorry. I only used one percent of my power in that punch just now.”

F***, how could you boast like that?

Ma Lirong felt like he was about to go crazy. He was already shameless enough, but why was Ling Han even more shameless?

AU right, you won’t yield until you’re faced with the grim reality!” he declared coldly. Xiu, with a move of his figure, he charged out.

Four times the speed of sound.

Ling Han chuckled. He had already reached four times the speed of sound before advancing into the Seventh Extreme, and now, he probably didn’t even need Floating Wind and Clouds to reach this kind of high speed.

He also moved, and began a dragged out battle with Ma Li Rong.

Both of them were astonishingly fast. Four times the speed of sound, and it was also thanks to their amazing physiques. Otherwise, if they had to make a turn at such a high speed, and come to a sudden stop, their bodies would be the first to collapse.

The sonic booms did not cease, and the shockwaves created were also wave after wave. Those with weaker abilities could not possibly approach at all, and were directly sent flying by the soundwaves.

Ma Lirong was shocked. How could this brat’s speed be so freakish?

He channeled a movement technique, and his speed increased again, reaching about 4.5 times.

Ling Han similarly used Floating Winds and Clouds. This did not allow his speed to reach five times the speed of sound, but it had reached 4.7 times, which was slightly faster than Ma Li Rong.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! He shot out Lightning Fist through the air, and multiple balls of light blasted towards Ma Lirong at an astonishing speed.

This was something that even Ma Lirong could not dodge. He had to stretch out his hand to parry.

Peng, peng, peng! Amidst the chaotic flashes of light, Ma Lirong was instantly left with only the power to parry.

Pu!

The four young men spluttered, their eyes wide. This scene was completely unacceptable to them.

A dignified elite of Enlightenment Tier was actually being suppressed by an Extreme Bone Tier?

No one would believe him even if he told them.

How could there be such a freakish guy?

Ma Lirong roared in fury. He had all this strength, but because he could not grasp Ling Han’s figure, he was completely unable to use it. He could only passively disperse Ling Han’s offensive. How could he not be resentful?

“Brat, do you only know such despicable moves?” he shouted loudly.

This was a despicable move?

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself. You, an Enlightenment Tier elite, came to bully him, an Extreme Bone Tier, and you have the nerve to call me despicable?

Fine, then let’s face it head-on!

Ling Han suddenly stopped, then charged towards Ma Lirong.

Ma Lirong was overjoyed. He had not thought that Ling Han would actually be so unable to withstand provocation.

“Brat, you are too inexperienced!” He laughed loudly, spreading out his palms, and delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han.

But when his palms struck out, he suddenly discovered that a hammer had appeared in Ling Han’s hands. Raising it, lightning blazed, and it was presently smashing towards him.

F***, a Spirit Tool!

He paled in shock. This was definitely a Spirit Tool that was superior to Celestial Path. The might it exuded caused a sudden chill to rise up in him.

‘You’re far too sinister, aren’t you? You pretended to be fighting me head-on, yet who would’ve thought that you’d directly take out a high-level Spirit Tool!’ -Though this was only a One Star level, for those below Celestial Path, One Star was still a high-level Spirit Tool.

He hurriedly rolled to one side..
