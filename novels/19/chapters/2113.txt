Chapter 2114: Two Great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu faltered for a moment before killing intent suddenly flooded his eyes.

This was the power of darkness! This was his mortal enemy!

Boom!

Brilliant light radiated from his Celestial King Bone, and numerous symbols pulsated as they soared into the sky. In fact, even the chaotic winds above the continent were ripped apart by these symbols, unable to wreak chaos any longer.

“Die!” Xiao Gu wore an expression of wild rage as he charged at the Black Dragon King.

“Huh?!”

A surprised expression spread across the Black Dragon King’s face. She hadn’t paid any heed to Ling Han and the others before. After all, only the Eternal Celestial King was worthy of being considered as her opponent.

Now that Xiao Gu was unleashing his rage, however, she was surprised to sense a powerful aura that she couldn’t ignore.

“Haha! Old Bone Demon, you’re finally going to unleash your might?” the Eternal Celestial King said with a loud laugh.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu had no interest in mimicking others at this moment. He reached into his body, pulling out his Celestial King Bone, and swinging it at the Black Dragon King.

“Old Bone Demon?” the Black Dragon King murmured with a frown. Realization suddenly struck her, and she exclaimed, “You’re the Bone Demon Celestial King!”

Apprehension spread across her face. The Bone Demon Celestial King enjoyed an equal standing with the Eternal Celestial King, but he had attained dao even earlier. According to rumors, he was genuinely a bone that had gained awareness and intelligence. In the end, he had become a Celestial King. Thus, even though Xiao Gu was in an unintelligent state at this moment, as long as that Celestial King Bone existed, no one would dare to underestimate him.

Boom!

Radiant light swirled around the Celestial King Bone, and dozens of symbols started to light up one after another. Each symbol represented a true meaning of the great dao, and any one of them would be powerful enough to crush the sky. If this weren’t the void, it was very likely that the heavens would have already been shattered.

However, there existed the treasure of a Heavenly Venerate here, and its toughness was such that even the battle between Xiao Gu, the Black Dragon King, and the Eternal Celestial King couldn’t damage it significantly. They could only shatter some of the boulders and destroy some of the cliffs.

Otherwise, the casual attack of a Celestial King could easily obliterate such a valley, transforming it into a vast sea or even an expanse of void.

The Black Dragon King roared with laughter, and said, “Let me spar with the two renowned Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings who could once rival the might of my father!”

A lotus with 16 petals bloomed between her brows, causing a dark aura to instantly radiate from her body. At this moment, she seemed wholly incompatible with this continent.

“Dark Destruction Wave of the Black Dragon!” she roared. She threw a punch, unleashing a burst of black light that transformed into a dark dragon head that snapped its jaws at Xiao Gu and the Eternal Celestial King.

When the dragon head neared them, it suddenly widened its jaws and breathed out a black lotus. A boundless destructive aura instantly permeated the surroundings, and it was as if it were about to annihilate the entire world.

The Eternal Celestial King and Xiao Gu both counterattacked with their full might.

Peng, peng, peng!

They both unleashed powerful celestial techniques to attack the black lotus.

However, the black lotus was a terrifying existence, and it was as if it were an independent realm itself. It could neither be blocked nor destroyed. To their surprise, it continued to slowly crash down upon the Eternal Celestial King and Xiao Gu.

“Hahahaha! What Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Before the power of darkness, you’re nothing but trash!” the Black Dragon King said with laughter. She made a tapping motion at the black lotus, providing it with more energy.

“Bell of Time, come!” the Eternal Celestial King roared.

Weng!

The large bronze bell in the valley immediately rang in reply, shooting into the sky, and flying toward the Eternal Celestial King.

“Song of the Ages!” he cried. He then pointed at the Bell of Time.

Ring!

The ring of the bell reverberated through the void.

Ring, ring, ring!

The bell rang several more times, with some rings coming from the past, and some rings coming from the future.

The Eternal Celestial King was a Celestial King who had grasped the Regulations of Time. He had also cultivated this Regulation to the paramount level, allowing him to alter the past and influence the future.

Weng!

A passageway was opened in the void, from which a man in azure flew out.

This was another Eternal Celestial King!

This was the Eternal Celestial King from another time. This was the Eternal Celestial King from eight epochs ago—before he had died. Using the Bell of Time as a medium, the current Eternal Celestial King had forcefully summoned himself from the past.

This was an existence from the past, so it naturally couldn’t stay in the present for long. However, that was a genuine Ninth Heaven Celestial King! If he unleashed his full power, he could easily kill an Eighth Heaven Celestial King within a few exchanges.

‘Song of the Ages… Perhaps this celestial technique was passed down from the Eternal Celestial King?’

The Black Dragon King’s expression instantly changed.

She definitely couldn’t allow this Celestial King of the past to arrive. Otherwise, her fate could only be death.

With a loud roar, scales instantly materialized over her body as she transformed into a dragon. She then violently swiped her claw at the passageway of time.

Peng!

A devastating power swept past, instantly obliterating the passageway of time.

The Eternal Celestial King involuntarily frowned. He was far too weak at this moment, while his existence of the past was far too powerful. This resulted in his existence of the past being incredibly difficult and slow to summon. With the interference of the Black Dragon King, his passageway of time was more so directly destroyed.

“Is that all you’ve got?” the Black Dragon King asked with a wanton laugh.

Two once-powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were now painfully struggling before her. This caused her to feel extremely smug.

What did it matter that they were once paramount and lofty? Right now, they could only suffer at her hands!

“I’ll send you on your way!” The Black Dragon King swooped through the air, stepping on a black lotus with 16 petals that was radiating with a violent destructive aura. At this moment, she was seemingly invincible.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu was furious, yet his power could only reach the Eighth Heaven. In fact, it was even slightly weaker. Thus, he naturally couldn’t suppress the Black Dragon King. Meanwhile, the Eternal Celestial King was more so only a shell of his former self. His remnant divine sense was about to die out at any moment.

Their defeat was already set in stone!

“Retreat!” Lu Hairong resolutely commanded. If they waited for the Black Dragon King to defeat the two Celestial Kings, their only fate would be death.

How could they rival a Seventh Heaven Celestial King? Moreover, this was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King who possessed the battle prowess of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King.

“You guys leave first!” Ling Han shouted. After pondering for a moment, he immediately made a decision.

He couldn’t abandon those Source Powers of heaven and earth. First of all, they could allow him to become more powerful. Second of all, if those Source Powers fell into the hands of the force of darkness, they would draw another step closer to a full-scale invasion from the force of darkness.

He had to give this a try. Anyhow, his confidence was derived from the existence of the Black Tower.

“We’ll accompany you!” the Empress immediately said.

“No, only if you leave can I go all out,” Ling Han said. If the Black Tower unleashed its full power, he believed that its overwhelming might could rival the Black Dragon King or even suppress her. However, it might also attract the attention of those old monsters.

Thus, he couldn’t have any vulnerabilities around him.

The Empress was a resolute person, and she immediately nodded in understanding. She dragged the screaming Hu Niu along with her as she leaped toward Lu Hairong.

Lu Hairong didn’t try to persuade Ling Han, either. Since he was the successor of that mighty being, it was necessary for him to possess such courage. Moreover, he might also possess the ability to pluck fortune from the flames.

“Let’s go!” With a wave of her hand, she immediately grabbed the Empress and the others. She then immediately dashed into the distance.

“Stinky insects!” the Black Dragon King sneered. Their actions didn’t escape her gaze, and she immediately launched a casual attack, aiming to kill Lu Hairong and the others. However, the Eternal Celestial King obstructed her in a timely manner, immediately blocking her attack. This instant was all Lu Hairong needed to tear through the sky and escape into the void.

With the chaotic winds raging through the void, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be able to discover Lu Hairong and the others.

“Small Tower, point me to the Source Powers of heaven and earth!” Ling Han said with a resolute expression. He definitely had to obtain those Source Powers of heaven and earth. Even if he couldn’t obtain them, he had to release them from this void. They definitely couldn’t fall into the hands of the Black Dragon King.

“Follow my guidance,” Small Tower. It was seemingly aware of the gravity of the situation as well, and it surprisingly didn’t tease or argue with Ling Han. Instead, it immediately started to guide him toward the Source Powers of heaven and earth.
