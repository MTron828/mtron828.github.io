Chapter 3526: Hunted down by Hong Tianbu

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han had been sneak attacked.

Actually, it was not that he was completely unguarded against this, because when he had been running, he had repeatedly felt like he was being spied on. It was just that he had not discovered it all this while.

Thus, he kept his guard up all this while, and stayed alert. As expected, when he was cultivating, this time when he was most fragile, most unguarded, the attack suddenly arrived.

“Hong Tianbu!” Ling Han called out loudly.

Amidst the dust cloud, a tall, slender figure walked out. It was as if he had brought with him a divine light, and was still flickering amidst the dust cloud, possessing an air of transcendence.

As expected, it was Hong Tianbu.

Ling Han knew it. Aside from Hong Tianbu, who had fused with the eye of a Primordial Vicious Beast, who else could target him from afar and he could not throw him off his trail?

“Even with that, I was still unable to kill you. What a real shock,” Hong Tianbu said calmly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “What is it? Previously, I played around with you, and you couldn’t help but feel killing intent?”

Hong Tianbu shook his head and said, “You’re a mere Inscription Tier cultivator, so you’re not qualified to mess with me. I don’t care about you at all. However, you have a rare treasure that can hide your tracks. I’m determined to obtain it.”

“What are you talking about?” Ling Han spread out his hands.

Hong Tianbu pointed at his forehead. Although so many days had passed, and the large bump on his forehead had mostly recovered, it still bulged slightly, “Have you forgotten that you were the one who did this?”

Ling Han was astonished. Hadn’t he knocked the other out with a single strike? Moreover, he had even used the Void Beast hide to conceal himself. How had this guy guessed?

“Humph, I have fused with the eye of a Primordial Beast, so I naturally can observe the Void,” Hong Tianbu said proudly.

He must be boasting. Otherwise, he would have long since discovered Ling

Han’s presence.

However, at a close distance, the eye of this Primordial Beast should still be able to discover Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, “You are really good at tolerance. You clearly know that I have robbed you, yet did not make any move at all! Hong Tianbu, should I call you Hong Turtle in future?”

However, Hong Tianbu wasn’t angered at all. He had already taken control of everything, so what need was there for him to be angry or anxious?

“The thing you used to smash me should be a precious treasures, right? It caused me to be plagued with bad luck, and even my great fortune could not stop it.” He said curiously, “You don’t have to tell me. After I kill you, I will personally find it out.”

Ling Han sighed, “In that case, I should have killed you in the past.

“You won’t have a chance!” Hong Tianbu said proudly. “I have a protective treasured seal on me. If you kill me, you’ll only incite a backlash from the treasured seal. You wouldn’t have been able to leave the Hong Clan at all.”

Judging by the other’s appearance, he should not be lying.

In the first place, Ling Han was only teasing him. He had never regretted any decision that he had made.

“Alright, now that we’re done chatting, it’s about time for us to get serious, right?” he asked with a smile.

“Are you even a match for me?” Hong Tianbu asked coldly. However, he suddenly lashed out. Boom! He unleashed a palm strike, and a devastating power surged toward Ling Han.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Han turned around and fled.

Fight my a*s. Hong Tianbu was a Mystery Realm Tier, and was not affected by Absolute Fairness. If he went up to fight, that would be an action of courting death.

“Do you think you can escape?” Hong Tianbu asked as he chased after him. He hadn’t attacked all this while because they were still not very far from the Imperial Capital. Who knew if Chen Fengyan would be able to sense his presence?

He was a Mystery Realm Tier elite, and even if he didn’t use any movement technique, his speed still reached six times the speed of sound, indescribably fast.

However, an unexpected scene appeared. Hong Tianbu had just set off in pursuit, when he stumbled and fell directly onto the ground.

A pit suddenly appeared in the ground. Furthermore, Hong Tianbu just happened to have an instant when the mystical power surged and stagnated. With these two coincidences added together, it actually caused a Mystery Realm Tier elite to stumble.

Ling Han turned around to take a look, and couldn’t help but laugh loudly. Obviously, after Hong Tianbu suffered that brick, his bad luck still hadn’t disappeared. Now, he actually fell flat on the ground. If this spread out, people would really laugh themselves to death.

However, it was a shame that he didn’t have the time to use the Wide Star Vine to record it. Otherwise, he could have broadcasted it live for Hong Tianbu. However, Hong Tianbu naturally wouldn’t be delayed for too long because of this fall. He immediately bounced up, his face filled with fury, and set off in rapid pursuit of Ling Han.

His speed was too fast. After using a movement technique, he had reached seven times the speed of sound, and quickly closed the distance between himself and Ling Han.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. After this Hong Tianbu had fused with the eye of a Primordial Vicious Beast, he seemed to have transformed into a member of the Demon Race as well. The rate of advancement of his cultivation level far surpassed that of normal humans. Originally, he had already pulled the gap between their cultivation levels to one major tier, but now, it had become a gap of two major tiers.

It could not be helped. Ling Han could only use Imminent Skyline. In an instant, he had crossed over a 50km, and then crossed that distance again, and again, and again. After taking seven consecutive steps, he felt as if all the blood in his body was boiling, and every bit of flesh was about to fall off his body.

He hurriedly stopped, and first threw the Essence Nurturing Gourd into a small stream. Then, he himself entered as well, going with the flow of the water. Behind them, Hong Tianbu suddenly lost track of Ling Han. The explosive power of Imminent Skyline was too high.

He released a furious roar. This was originally the secret technique that he had obtained, but it had been stolen by Ling Han before he could fully comprehend it, causing him to not be able to master it.

Ling Han had fled using the secret technique that he had stolen from him. How ironic was this for him?

“You can’t run!” Hong Tianbu said coldly. Above his head, a massive eye suddenly appeared in the air. It slowly opened, as if it could penetrate the universe, exuding an incredibly vicious might.

Hong Tianbu’s eyes were tightly shut, yet his eyelids were rapidly twitching. He had already opened the eye of the Primordial Vicious Beast. The eye above his head was only an image. It was because the Primordial Vicious Beast had been too powerful in the past, and now that it was activated, it could still take form. However, no matter how hard he searched, he couldn’t find any trace of Ling

Han.

“How is this possible?” He frowned. With Ling Han’s cultivation level, it was impossible for him to cast Imminent Skyline too many times. He was very clear about this fact.

“That gourd!”

He suddenly recalled that Ling Han had snatched a fated opportunity from Hong Tianliang all those years ago, and that was the Essence Nurturing Gourd of Ling Han. It could contain living beings, and even in the previous generation, this was a precious treasure that would make even Spirit Transformation True Lords feel greed.

Hong Tianbu hurriedly opened the Eye of the Primordial Vicious Beast again to search. However, Ling Han had already run far enough in the first place, and added with the gourd flowing with the flow of the water, it had already surpassed the range of vision of the Eye of the Primordial Vicious Beast.

It could no longer be seen.

“Damn it!” Hong Tianbu said unwillingly. He had kept an eye on the Foreign Affairs Department, and knew that Ling Han would definitely go to the Ethereal Peak. Sure enough, he had caught him, but he had never thought that Ling Han would escape right under his nose.

“He will definitely go to Ethereal Peak, and I can still wait for him there.” He calmed down. It was already very difficult for him to intercept and kill Ling Han, but since Ling Han had moved out for the sake of Ethereal Peak, he would definitely be able to stand guard there until Ling Han arrived.

Without any further hesitation, he moved, and rapidly left.
