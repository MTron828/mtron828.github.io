Chapter 2568: Suffering the consequences of his own actions.

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Very terribly!” Li He revealed a grin filled with cruelty.

With a wave of his right hand, a green snake immediately slithered out of his sleeve. Then, it was a centipede, followed by a scorpion… They were all close together, and all of them were venomous creatures.

“Soon, you will be slowly devoured bit by bit by these precious pets of mine,” Li He said. “The flesh and blood of a Celestial King are very nutritious, and will help these precious pets grow even faster.”

Freak!

Ling Han nodded. He had not encountered anyone who was normal here.

Then, he should just kill him. There was really nothing much he wanted to say to this kind of person that played around with poisonous creatures.

With a flick of his finger, a flash of Sword Qi swept out.?Pu, the green snake was instantly beheaded by the Sword Qi.

If it had only lost its head, the green snake would not die, but this flash of Sword Qi from Ling Han contained his martial intent as well. To the green snake, this was a deadly disaster, immediately crushing its mind.

Mind destroyed, physical body crushed… That definitely meant death.

“Little Qing! Little Qing!” Li He looked as if it was his son that had died, and immediately cried out in grief. He was even really close to tearing up. After howling for a while, he raised his head, his eyes filled with viciousness.

“You actually dare to kill my precious, I will give you a tragic end!”

Ling Han smiled faintly. “You speak as if you were originally very kind.”

“You will not die too easily!” Li He charged over. As he stretched out both arms, his thin, wood-like hands suddenly glowed, and actually turned golden. It was like they were two tiny suns, so bright that it was blinding, and no one could look directly at them.

Li He smirked coldly. This was a secret technique that he had cultivated. The Regulations of Metal were contained in the light, which could wound the eyes and injure the divine sense of his opponent. Anyone who did not know his background would very easily fall for this.

Next, he had another successive move, and it was guaranteed that he would be able to easily take down his opponent.

By then, he would not easily allow Ling Han to die, but would rather have those precious pets of his slowly devour Ling Han alive. Hearing the latter’s pained screams would cause him great excitement and exhilaration.

He was smirking coldly, yet suddenly saw an iron fist was flying towards him.

‘What’s going on?’

He was stunned, and finally reacted. This was a counterattack from Ling Han.

How was this possible?

Being affected by his secret technique, Ling Han was actually still able to throw out a punch so accurately?

However, this thought had just formed when?peng, his face immediately sustained a heavy punch. Frightening power instantly reverberated throughout his body. There was also an indescribable streak of martial intent, which made him feel as if he was facing a noble and proud Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

This was not because Ling Han’s cultivation level was too high, but rather because the Dao he cultivated was too majestic. He was clearly just in Third Heaven, but actually gave off the pressure that should be accorded to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Peng!

Then, Li He landed heavily on the ground, and felt as if every single bone in his body had been crushed into dust. He could not even muster up the slightest bit of strength.

Ling Han appeared above him, looking down on him from above with a calm expression. There was not the slightest hint of pride on his face, as if defeating Li He was something that could not be any more normal.

The gap in strength was really too wide. How could there be such a freakish person in this world?

Ling Han smiled slightly. “I have always been a very fair person. However you wanted to treat me, I will return the same treatment.”

Li He faltered at first, and then realization suddenly dawned on him. To his terror, he discovered that the eyes of those precious pets of his were shining viciously as they stared fixatedly at him.

To be more exact, they were looking at his flesh and blood.

This was the flesh and blood of a Celestial King. To them, those were very nutritious.

“No—” He had just spoken when?pa, a poisonous scorpion had already hopped onto his face. Its two pincers gripped his tongue, and it severed his tongue with a scissoring motion, and crawled into his mouth.

With it leading the way, even more poisonous creatures crawled into his body through his mouth.

“Urgh!” Li He released a muffled groan, his face instantly twitching. Not only were these poisonous creatures devouring him alive, they themselves also carried powerful poison, causing him tremendous agony.

Initially, this was the agony that he would watch his defeated opponents suffer, while he himself laughed loudly by the sidelines. However, after he traded places with his victims, he finally knew just how cruel this was.

He swore that he would definitely kill all the venomous creatures if he could survive this.

“Eat him!”

“Eat him!”

“Eat him!”

Yet, the spectators had all erupted. Actually, they did not care whom these venomous creatures would be eating. It was fine as long as the spectacle was bloody and gory enough.

Li He was both furious and terrified. These spectators had always cheered for him, but now they were actually cheering on those poisonous creatures, telling them to eat him faster, which was something he could not accept. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, he was even more terrified because he really would be devoured alive by these poisonous creatures. From then, he would no longer exist in this world.

However, with the numbing effects of the poison, he could not release any sound at all. But his consciousness was extraordinarily alert, and he could feel every single detail of the agony. This almost drove him mad.

All the bones in his body had already been broken, but his body was actually still shivering, and his skin was still twitching, which showed just how great the agony that he was presently suffering was.

Ling Han waved a hand.?Pa, Li He was immediately destroyed, and those poisonous creatures were also crushed.

Just the look of them was disgusting.

“No!” On the spectators’ seats, a great many people shouted. Why did he have to kill Li He so quickly? He should have allowed him to be eaten alive completely. Only that would be fun enough.

These people turned around and jeered at Ling Han, wanting nothing more than to release another swarm of poisonous creatures to decour Ling Han, compensating for their disappointment.

Ling Han swept his gaze coldly over these people. The more he came into contact with them, the more he understood that the people here had all lost their minds. There was absolutely no need to have any kind of sympathy for them. One dying meant one better.

If any single one of them escaped, just how astonishing could the damage caused by a Celestial King be?

After the commentator announced Ling Han’s victory, Ling Han left the battle zone, and went to the lobby backstage.

This time, Tang Yuan did not come to see him. After all, he considered himself the master here. He could occasionally reward his subordinate, but how could he constantly humble himself to that level? What if it caused his subordinate to gain a puffed up opinion of themselves, and they did not even take him, the master, seriously anymore?

He made quick arrangements. Once Ling Han achieved another three wins, he could be crowned as the Blood Martial King, and challenge the Blood Martial King that belonged to Lu Li.

Day after day passed. This time, the time taken was even longer. Over a month later, the opponent for the eighth match was confirmed.

Sima Qing.

“Sima Qing?” When Tang Yuan had hold of the data about the opponent, he was surprised. That was because this Sima Qing was actually about equal in strength to Li He. They were both Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings, and had also previously gained nine successive wins in a row.

If there was any difference, it was that Sima Qing had attained nine successive wins more times than Li He had, but that was only just two times more than the latter.

Li He couldn’t even survive a single exchange with Ling Han. Then even if Sima Qing was slightly stronger than Ling Han, so what? Just how many strikes from Ling Han could be blocked?

This was practically gifting another victory straight to Ling Han.

“Could it be that the tournament authorities have deliberately given some leeway for the sake of Father?” Tang Yuan stroked his chin. “However, Li Long is indeed very strong. Throwing the match in this way is actually not too wrong, either.”

The next day, Ling Han’s eighth match began.

As expected, when the commentator had finished his introductions of the information of both sides, the spectators erupted in booing and jeers. Wasn’t this just deliberately throwing the match?

“Fake battle! Fake battle! Fake battle!” everyone was shouting loudly. Anyone who dared to fight a faked battle should be executed.
