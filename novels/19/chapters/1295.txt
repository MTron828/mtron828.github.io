1296 Can“t Kill Him No Matter Wha

Faceless couldn’t understand Ling Han’s determination to fight alone. The situation was already so dire, so why was he still unwilling to ask for help?

In a few breaths time at most, Ling Han would definitely be killed!

The members of the Five Sects were all holding their breaths. They had paid a huge price, and almost everyone had shaved 10,000 years off their lifespan. This was the moment they were all waiting for.

‘Die! Hurry up and die!’

The five God Tools slammed down together. Their pinnacle level battle prowess was devastating, and the divine light that radiated from them enveloped and drowned Ling Han.

“F*ck yeah!”

“We’ve finally killed him!”

“Long live the Five Sects!”

The disciples of the Five Sects all whooped in joy. From today onward, they would finally be able to sleep in peace again.

Faceless faltered for a moment. Then, a faint smile immediately spread across his face. His divine sense was extremely sensitive, and he had already sensed the change taking place within the sea of surging divine light.

Under Han Feng and the other’s control, the five God Tools all deactivated and returned to their original resting positions.

However, the ensuing scene sowed despair into their hearts.

Instead of a flattened mush of flesh, what entered their vision was the sight of Ling Han standing tall and proud, not a single wound on his body. It was as if he wasn’t the person battling against them just then.

‘This, this, this... How is this possible?!’

To say nothing of the members of the Five Sects, even Faceless was absolutely stunned. Although he had sensed that Ling Han hadn’t died, he hadn’t been able to determine how Ling Han had escaped the deadly crisis.

He could only conclude that Ling Han possessed an insane recovery ability, one that could heal his wounds and return him to the peak of his powers in an instant.

This was obviously thanks to the Indestructible True Fluid. After circulating a drop, Ling Han had naturally returned to normal.

Ling Han smiled widely, and said, “Please continue. What are you all acting so polite for?”

‘Who’s acting polite?’

The disciples of the Five Sects wanted to cry, yet no tears were coming forth. They had already sacrificed tens of thousands of years of their lifespan. If they activated the five God Tools again, wouldn’t they have to sacrifice several tens of thousands of years more of their lifespan?

One had to realize that even cultivators at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier only possessed a lifespan of 4,000,000 years. In any case, many of the disciples present were only at the low extreme. Thus, the theoretical maximum of their lifespan was only 1,000,000 years. How many more times could they sacrifice their lifespan?

“Continue to activate the ancestral weapons! We must kill this evil brat!” Tie Wuya shouted from the side. After some emergency treatment, he had finally managed to regain some of his battle prowess. At the very least, he would be able to control the God Tools.

The disciples of the Five Sects all grumbled in their minds. Those five elites only needed to control the God Tools, yet the people who were sacrificing their lifespan were them!

Why was it them who needed to pay with their lifespan?

However... did they have a choice right now? If Ling Han didn’t die, they would become the ones who would die. However, if they gave it their all to kill Ling Han, they would only lose a portion of their lifespan—this was better than dying, right?

‘F*ck it!’

The disciples started to activate the God Tools again, injecting their Origin Power into them. When they ran out of Origin Power, they would reluctantly allow their vitality to be sucked away.

Weng!

Divine light burst from the five God Tools again, releasing an aura of invincibility.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “It’s useless even if you activate these God Tools 100 more times. Today is the day that I’m going to serve justice and exact revenge for the Lower Realm!”

“Quit dreaming!” Han Feng and the others said coldly. As long as they could activate the five God Tools, they could continue to suppress Ling Han. Moreover, they refused to believe that Ling Han could recover without limit.

The five God Tools unleashed their fury at Ling Han. Meanwhile, Ling Han actively channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. If he suffered minor wounds, he would be able to recover immediately. If he suffered more severe wounds, he could still heal and turn them into minor wounds. After a short while, these minor wounds would also recover.

After comprehending a tiny portion of Rising From The Ashes’ profound mysticality, his recovery ability was also starting to become increasingly freakish.

Moreover, this still wasn’t the full might of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Not only did the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll bestow him a powerful recovery ability, but it even allowed his physique to become freakishly tough. According to the words of Small Tower, channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll after reaching the Heavenly Body Tier and comprehending the secret techniques of the Primal Chaos Origin Beast, Thousand Transformations Tortoise, and Diamond Ant would allow him to block a single strike from a Saint.

Of course, he could only block a single strike. After blocking a single strike, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t have enough energy to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll again.

However, this was still incredibly frightening. A Heavenly Body Tier elite blocking a single strike of a Saint? This was heaven-defying!

Anyhow, Ling Han could only comprehend this portion of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll after advancing one major tier and reaching the Heavenly Body Tier. At that time, he would also gain access to the fifth level of the Black Tower and unlock all five of the elements. As a result, the Black Tower would also be able to simulate more Celestial Level environments.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Attacks rained down on Ling Han as the five God Tools continued to unleash their might. These God Tools were trying to kill him, yet Ling Han still had the spare energy to let his mind wander. After channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, there was a golden glow around his body, making it appear as if he were an invincible war god.

He was incredibly relaxed, yet the people from the Five Sects were all fighting as if their lives depended on it. The disciples continued to channel their vitality into the five God Tools so that they could continue to unleash their full power. If they slacked off even a tiny bit, these God Tools would lose their ability to wound Ling Han. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They were truly fighting with their lives!

Ling Han chuckled coldly. Generation after generation of Lower Realm beings had been killed to refine Realm Pills. Meanwhile, the people in front of him right now had all ingested such Realm Pills. He was going to kill these people slowly and painfully.

The battle raged on.

From the perspective of the Five Sects, this battle was incredibly intense and precarious. If they relented even a little, Ling Han would have the chance to escape from their grasp. However, they gradually became weaker and weaker as time trickled away. The God Tools were absorbing their vitality in a snowballing manner—in other words, it was demanding more and more of their vitality for the same amount of power with the passing of time.

Many disciples were sucked dry of their vitality. Apart from being able to blink their eyes from time to time, they looked almost exactly like lifeless corpses.

They were already running out of vitality to provide. However, the five God Tools were still voracious in their demand for more energy. Oh, no, it wasn’t the five God Tools that were demanding energy. It was Han Feng and the four other elites who were controlling the God Tools and making them demand more energy!

In Han Feng and the other elites’ eyes, everyone apart from them could be sacrificed. As long as they could kill Ling Han, everything would be worth it. Compared to killing Ling Han, what was the life of a few hundred Sun Moon Tier elites worth?

However, they were destined to be disappointed.

Ling Han circulated another drop of Indestructible True Fluid. Although its effects were far weaker than the first drop’s, it was still able to heal more than half of the wounds on his body. Meanwhile, the five God Tools were already nearing the end of their powers. The might of their attacks was decreasing by the second.

Han Feng and the others all fell into despair. The 100 or so disciples had all been sucked dry, yet Ling Han was still fighting energetically. How could they defeat him?

“Retreat!” they shouted reluctantly.

There was already no more vitality for the five God Tools to absorb. Thus, there was no point battling against Ling Han any longer. If they insisted on continuing this battle, perhaps even they would lose their lives in this place.

“Trying to flee?” Ling Han asked with a sneer. “You’ve attacked me for so long, so it’s my turn to attack now!”

He thrust his sword forward, unleashing a burst of Sword Qi that instantly reaped the lives of several dozen Five Sects disciples. In reality, the days of these disciples were already numbered even if Ling Han didn’t kill them.

Meanwhile, Han Feng and the four other elites grabbed the God Tools and retreated. They were extremely powerful, and thus their battle prowess was still sufficient to battle against Ling Han even after accounting for the detrimental effect of heaven’s might. However, if they fought a drawn-out battle, the victor would definitely be Ling Han. This was because he possessed a near-invincible physique.

Anyhow, now that Han Feng and the others were fleeing, there was genuinely nothing that Ling Han could do.

He could indeed catch up to them if he activated the Star Plucking Step. However, if Han Feng and the others teamed up to fight against him, they would still be able to break free from him and escape.

This being the case, he would collect their lives when he attacked the headquarters of the Five Sects in the future.
