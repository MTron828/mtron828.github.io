Chapter 1580: Then we’ll battle

“Are you afraid to accept the challenge?” Zheng Mo continued to provoke Ling Han. He spread out his own silvery river, and it could be clearly seen that most of the stars within had dimmed, and there were merely 10,000 stars that were still exuding blazing light.

10,000 stars was the standard of someone who had just broken through to the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

This would be a relatively fair battle because what determined the battle prowess of a cultivator was not merely power, but also Regulations. Thus, though Zheng Mo had sealed his power, he was still at the height of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier in terms of Regulations.

The other prodigies smirked coldly. If you did not have the courage to accept even a battle like this, would you still be qualified to call yourself a king tier?

Liu Gan, meanwhile, showed a sliver of displeasure in his expression. He had already said that Ling Han did not have to take part in the competition, yet Zheng Mo still wanted to challenge Ling Han, and this naturally caused his displeasure. This was a challenge to his authority.

However, the competition had been held just now, and he said that Ling Han did not have to participate, and he indeed had not. But it was a different situation now; this was a challenge. Even he did not have the right to stop them. Only the person involved was allowed to make his own decision whether to accept the challenge or otherwise.

You could refuse, and the challenger could not make an aggressive move, but in that way, the one who had been challenged would be humiliated and become the target of public scorn and derision.

Fearing to fight even in a relatively fair battle? We’d look down on you!

Ling Han smiled faintly. He was just wanting to give this guy a beating; he had not imagined that the latter would actually deliver himself right up to his doorstep, very good! He patted the Empress’s delicate hand so that she would not be angry while he stood up.

“If you want a battle, then we’ll battle!”

Zheng Mo was overjoyed. In his eyes, his chances were naturally mostly assured. Ling Han was merely in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and even if he sealed off his own power, the height of his Regulations was still there, and that would be the consummate level completely overwhelming and suppressing the high extreme.

“Haha, I will let you have the first 10 moves,” he said, purposely seeming very generous.

“All right!” Ling Han was indifferent. With a leap, he shot out a punch at Zheng Mo. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Since Zheng Mo had already announced that he would let Ling Han have the first 10 moves, he would naturally not break his own word in public. He crossed his arms in front of his own chest, planning to take this strike from Ling Han head-on.

Peng!

Ling Han’s punch arrived, and with a burst of power, it blasted out towards Zheng Mo.

Light shot to the skies. When the power had completely dispersed, Zheng Mo was still standing proudly. He had cultivated to the pinnacle level at the Mountain River Tier, Sun Moon Tier, and Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, even in a battle of equals, his power would not be inferior to Ling Han’s, either, and added with the fact that he could overwhelm the latter in terms of Regulations, his battle prowess had far surpassed Ling Han’s.

Yet, he gritted his teeth slightly. This was a solid attack that was delivered at close quarters, causing even his bones to tremble slightly. He felt discomfort through his internal organs, and felt an urge to throw up.

F***, it seemed like this guy’s physique was extremely amazing. It would not be advisable to battle at close range with this person. The impact of a solid hit was too strong on his body.

Ling Han shot out another punch.

Zheng Mo had absolutely no wish to have a physical battle with Ling Han, but since he already said that he would let Ling Han have the first 10 moves, then he could either block or dodge these 10 blows... but would he have the nerve to dodge? He had bragged too much just now. If he dodged now, what would happen to his pride?

He could only grit his teeth, and exchange blows with Ling Han again.

Peng, their two fists crashed into each other, and in the wave of power that resulted, it seemed like even the space around them was about to be torn open, which was incredibly frightening.

This was a battle at the level of the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Furthermore, they were two king tiers whose battle prowess had directly soared to the consummate level, so it was naturally incredibly terrifying.

Zheng Mo did not shrink back in the slightest, and still appeared very much at ease, yet only he himself was aware that the impact of this punch caused even his bones to hum, and he had still not recovered even by now. It was as if they would soon shatter into a few hundred pieces.

“What a piece of trash. In a battle of equal cultivation level, he was already allowed to have the first 10 moves, and he is still not unable to get an advantage!” Around them, some people were beginning to mock and ridicule Ling Han.

Previously, they had practically not met Ling Han before, yet had heard of his name because it was rumored that Ling Han was to take the position of the seventeenth elder, which naturally made them displeased. What right did an outsider, and a person who was so much weaker than them, have to be placed higher than all of them?

This battle was clear proof that he was practically a piece of trash!

“Humph, who knows what desolate corner he has crawled out of; he actually deludes himself into thinking of being in a higher position than all of us. What wishful thinking!”

“Then we will allow him to understand through this battle that a piece of trash will always be a piece of trash. No matter how much he is flattered, he will still be dirt!”

“Hahaha, then just let Zheng Mo teach him a good lesson!”

Ling Han naturally would not take these words to heart. He charged out a third time, and still shot out a punch. It was a simple, direct and rough move.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han shot out seven punches consecutively, and Zheng Mo took these seven blows head-on, showing no weakness. He was like an unmovable boulder, as firm as a mountain.

In the eyes of spectators, it was naturally Zheng Mo who had full control of the situation. He only had to take the last three punches, and that would be the time for him to counterattack. It could be imagined that with his power, defeating Ling Han would be a piece of cake for him.

Yet, Zheng Mo felt like he was about to cry. The bones in his arms were really close to their limit. There were already web-like cracks on them, and if it were not for the fact that his power was strong, and he had forcibly condensed his Origin Power in his arms, they would have broken a long time ago.

But if he continued to forcibly hold on like this, how many more punches would he be able to endure?

Three punches... seemed like they were so far away!

Ling Han smiled softly, and comforted him, “Hold on for a while longer, there are only three more punches left.”

‘F*** you!’

Zheng Mo gritted his teeth, and declared, “After three moves, I will let you know what are the results of provoking me!”

“Yi, weren’t you the one who challenged me?” Ling Han pretended to be surprised. He raised his right fist, and shot out another punch without any hesitation.

Peng! Peng!

After another two punches, Zheng Mo finally couldn’t help but show a sliver of pain through his expression. This kind of close-range exchange of blows was something that all elites would be wary of because they would also have to sustain the full power of the backlash in a situation in which the power of both parties was about the same. However strong the power you blasted out, you would in truth also have to sustain as much on your own side.

Aside from those that concentrated on cultivating their physiques, no one’s bones would be too sturdy. Even if it was a Demon Master, he would not be able to hold up to such attacks, what more he.

“The last move!” Ling Han rushed out, his figure speeding up, becoming a flash of lightning. He drew out his right fist, and seemed like a divine dragon that was riding the winds.

Boom!

Zheng Mo gritted his teeth, and still chose to confront Ling Han head-on. His pride would not allow him to shrink back at this time.

This naturally was still a situation in which neither was at a clear advantage. In terms of power, the two of them were about the same, but subsequently, Zheng Mo unexpectedly did not begin his counterattack. Da, da, da. Blood was dripping from his fingertips.

“What?!”

Seeing this scene, everyone exclaimed in surprise. Their expressions were filled with disbelief. They couldn’t accept this outcome no matter how hard they tried.

Why had Zheng Mo suddenly been injured?

“Look!” Someone pointed at Zheng Mo’s arm.

Gasp!

Everyone inhaled sharply, and could see that Zheng Mo’s right arm had swollen so much that it was thicker than his thigh, and they could clearly see that it had become misshapen, and was covered with traces of blood.

This... was clearly his bones having been shattered into shards, and having pierced through his skin.

Only then did they know that every single time when Zheng Mo received a punch from Ling Han, he had to pay a very heavy price. His bones could not hold up to the impact, and with the accumulated damage from 10 punches, it finally formed a qualitative change, causing all the bones in his arm to shatter.

Multiple surprised gazes were directed at Ling Han. Even the three Demon Masters—Leng Xiaoran, Ouyang He, and Gou Hai—were no exception. Gu Feng, on the other hand, lowered his eyes, seemingly thinking deeply of something unknown.
