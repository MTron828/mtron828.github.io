1340 Arriving at Heaven“s Sword Palace

More than six years had passed.

In this period of time, some great elites had come to investigate the situation. There had even been two Saints who came personally—they were the Stone Emperor’s father and the North Emperor’s master, respectively—but they did not discover anything out of the ordinary.

...The strangeness should have to do with that ancient coffin, but now that the ancient coffin had shattered, even Saints would not be able to extract any kind of clue from it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, after the many elites died, there had once been a period of furor in this place, but it very soon returned back to a peaceful state.

By now, things had once again returned to the usual rhythm of the Two Realm Battlefield, and that was killing others, earning merit points, and gathering some Realm Spirit Stones while they were at it.

Ling Han strolled around. He no longer had any equal opponent in this place. As long as they had not exceeded the Eternal River Tier, his present abilities would be able to handle even one in the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier without any problems.

He journeyed on in silence, and returned to Wolf Fang City. He closed his account of merit points, and took out a large amount of alchemical pills to be sold, with all of the income being used to trade for Level 8 Godly metal.

However, Level 8 Godly metal was really very expensive. Others would only need about the size of a palm, or at most about the size of a human head, to forge any God Tool that they wanted. But in Ling Han’s case? The Divine Demon Sword was completely unreserved in swallowing the Godly metal, so he required an ocean’s worth of it.

He had really gotten himself a master!

Thankfully, the Black Tower had now opened up to its fifth floor, with the Five Elements completed, and basically formed a world of its own, so it could slowly produce various materials in large amounts. As long as Ling Han was given enough time, he could still improve the Divine Demon Sword up to Celestial Level.

...With regards to time, it might be tens of thousands of years, or could be several hundred million years. Even Small Tower could not say for sure how far the Black Tower had developed by this point, because the Black Tower was still in a state of serious damage, and was still far from recovering to its prime condition.

Ling Han did not bother too much. After he had the Divine Demon Sword swallow all the Godly metal, he went to grieve for the Purple Moon Divine Maiden. However, what pleasantly surprised him was the fact that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden actually had not died!

As it turned out, the Purple Moon Divine Maiden had only sent out a sliver of her divine sense into the underground abyss at the time. Though that sliver of divine sense had been destroyed, causing her to suffer a certain injury, compared with the other Eternal River Tier elites, she was much better off.

Ling Han was not qualified to pay a visit to the Purple Moon Divine Maiden. After he found out the news, he laughed long and loud, and began to make his way back to the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire.

After breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier, Ling Han’s speed was naturally even faster than before. Furthermore, the ability to fly allowed him to ignore all obstacles posed by the terrain, which was more suitable for a long journey. After a mere 10 days later, he had arrived at the mountain entrance of the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

He chose Heaven’s Sword Palace as his first stop because his disciple, Jiang Yuefeng, was here.

The Heaven’s Sword Palace was a city, in fact.

This city was called Heaven’s Sword City. The Heaven’s Sword Palace occupied two-thirds of the area of the whole city, and the remaining third was occupied by subsidiary establishments of the Heaven’s Sword Palace like various restaurants and inns, as well as those people who made a living in these places.

The Heaven’s Sword City was huge. Even though the Heaven’s Sword Palace was only a Sun Moon Tier-level force, the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire was really much, much too big. Even Sun Moon Tier-level forces could occupy a considerably large territory, and there was not much distance between the Five Great Sects, either. Their territories were connected with each other, and bordered on one another.

Ling Han did not rush. He walked all on his own, and soon arrived at the main doors of the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

Though he called them the main doors, it was actually merely an arc-shaped ring. There was no actual doorway or doors, which made it appear very imposing.

However, the absence of doors did not mean just anyone could go in. There were eight disciples standing at the main entrance on guard duty, and each of them held a weapon. They all stood ramrod straight with puffed up chests, using a disdainful gaze to sweep over the people walking to and fro, and appearing to be very aloof and remote.

In the Heaven’s Sword City, the Heaven’s Sword Palace was the most supreme Immortals.

These eight people were all in the Shattering Void Tier, and in a small world, this was practically a deployment that could scare one to death. Powerful Shattering Void Tier elites were actually degraded to acting as guards? But in the Immortal Realm, this was too ordinary. In fact, this even showed how poverty-stricken this place was. For example, the private guards of Empress Luan Xing were all in the Mountain River Tier, and the chief guard was even a Heavenly Body Tier elite.

Ling Han curbed his aura, and did not expose his identity and killing intent at first. He wanted to see how much Jiang Yuefeng had changed, and whether it was necessary to break the latter’s cultivation.

When they saw Ling Han approach, the eight disciples all simultaneously shouted, “Halt!”

However, though Ling Han had restrained the majority of his aura, as a powerful Heavenly Body Tier elite, it would be incredibly frightening even if he just leaked out the slightest bit of his aura. Hence, these eight disciples dared not be rash, or they would have long since drawn their weapons against Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I want to see Jiang Yuefeng.”

“You know Founder Jiang, sir?” one disciple asked. He seemed to be the leader of the eight people.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “I can be considered an old friend.”

The eight disciples immediately appeared reverent. Jiang Yuefeng was the genius of the Heaven’s Sword Palace. Though he had come from a small world, he had only used less than 10,000 years to advance into the Sun Moon Tier, and became a pillar of support for the Heaven’s Sword Sect.

This was a story of legend and inspiration, encouraging every disciple to work hard and attempt to become the second Jiang Yuefeng.

Thus, when Ling Han said he was Jiang Yuefeng’s old friend, these disciples naturally looked respectful.

“May I ask how we should address you so we can inform Founder Jiang, sir?” the disciple in the lead asked.

“Han Lin,” Ling Han answered, smiling.

“Please wait momentarily, sir.” That disciple told the remaining seven disciples to receive Ling Han well, while he himself turned around and quickly walked into the palace. If this allowed him to gain Founder Jiang’s favor so the latter could guide him a bit on his cultivation technique, then wouldn’t that be a colossal fated opportunity for him?

He scrambled off, the seven people left behind all looking enviously at him.

After a long while, that disciple was seen coming back from the distance, and there was a young girl dressed in red by his side. She was very beautiful, with a snow-white complexion, her long, black hair cascading down her shoulders, and her large eyes filled with mischief.

The two very soon came near enough, and that disciple hadn’t even begun to say anything when the young girl in red circled around Ling Han, sizing him up, and then asked, “I heard, you are my father’s old friend?”

Yi, this was Jiang Yuefeng’s daughter?

Ling Han smiled. Going by that theory, this girl could be considered his grand-disciple. Hiss, his son wasn’t even as old as this girl, and he had actually become a grandmaster, which was quite odd. He calmly said, “That’s right.”

“But why have I never heard Father say that he has an old friend by the surname of Han?” The young girl crossed her arms behind her back, and circled to stand behind Ling Han. Then, she suddenly stuck out her head. “Are you lying and actually do not know my father?”

Ling Han thought for a moment, then suddenly folded his hands, and displayed a palm technique.

This was something that he had once taught his four disciples. He had obtained it from within an ancient site. It had been a very arduous process, so the master and his four disciples had spent great amounts of effort and time to memorize this palm technique, and it was probable that only the five of them knew this technique in the whole world.

Though this could not be considered any powerful martial arts technique in the Immortal Realm, if Jiang Yuefeng had still thought of him as a master, he would definitely have passed this on to his daughter. This had already surpassed the range of a martial arts technique—it was rather a form of reminiscence.

“Yi, how do you know Cold Wind Palm?” The young girl dressed in red was very shocked.
