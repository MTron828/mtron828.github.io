Chapter 1836: Ling Han Again?

Ling Han stayed in the canyon for a day, taking a short rest.

He had obtained a great amount of loot, and he had spent the entire day looking over it. For example, there was Godly metal for his Divine Demon Sword. Apart from obtaining a huge pile of Pseudo-Divine Metal from Qianzhao Yang, he had also obtained a huge amount from Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng.

As the successors of powerful sects, they were all astoundingly wealthy!

After feeding all of this Pseudo-Divine Metal to his Divine Demon Sword, this future Celestial Tool advanced to become a Two-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool.

It was almost 30% of the way to becoming a genuine Celestial Tool.

Ling Han was extremely satisfied. The Divine Demon Sword had surpassed his cultivation level again, and it was now able to rival elites at the yin soul and the yang soul. However, it was a shame that it could only rival them in terms of toughness. This was because his cultivation level was still too low, which meant that he was unable to imbue the Divine Demon Sword with higher-level Regulations. As such, its might was partially restricted.

However, this didn’t matter. Everything would be resolved once he advanced to a suitable cultivation level.

Ling Han also refined the tree heart of the White Demon Tree, obtaining a wisp of murderous aura in the process. This murderous aura was built upon the Regulation of Slaughter, and in terms of destructive ability alone, it was even more impressive than most weapons.

In reality, everyone possessed a murderous aura. However, this aura was often uncontrollable. After cultivating the Regulation of Slaughter, however, one would be able to actively control this murderous aura. In fact, they would even be able to control the murderous aura of others.

The stronger one’s murderous aura, the more powerful their battle prowess would become. This was a typical case of nurturing oneself through battle, and becoming more and more ferocious through combat.

The next day, Ling Han decided to set off for the final region of the volcano with the Empress. He wanted to explore the depths of this mystery realm.

When they exited the canyon, however, they realized that it had suddenly become lively and boisterous. As it turned out, Bewitching Maiden Rou had arrived.

This seductive beauty from the Purity Sect was extremely alluring and charming, with each of her actions overflowing with beauty and elegance. Countless men were enchanted by her beauty, and those who had weaker resolve were already drooling with lust.

Bewitching Maiden Rou also noticed Ling Han and the Empress, and she couldn’t help but grimace upon seeing them.

She had naturally consumed the Reincarnation Tea. Moreover, because she had been angry, she had used all of the tea leaves at once. Afterward, she had fallen into inconsolable regret.

That was definitely Celestial Tea!

Although it wouldn’t help one comprehend Regulations, it would definitely help one comprehend the great dao! A single dream would last for eons, and this was naturally as impressive as could be!

‘You bastard! You gave me such a valuable treasure, yet you didn’t tell me about its unique properties? You caused me to waste almost all of it!

‘I truly want to bite you to death, you bastard!’

Bewitching Maiden Rou truly wanted to leap over and bite Ling Han. However, she forcefully suppressed her urge upon remembering that he was currently surrounded by trouble. If she leaped over, it was extremely likely that she would also become caught up in his mess.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle upon seeing this. He then held hands with the Empress and walked away. However, after taking just a few steps, the earth beneath them suddenly erupted. Three people shot out, and the weapons in their hands gleamed with a cold and murderous aura as they slashed and stabbed at Ling Han.

At the same time, the boulders in the surroundings also disappeared in unison. At least 10 people leaped out and charged at Ling Han.

People were charging over from everywhere, and they left Ling Han no path of escape.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. He wasn’t astonished about being attacked, but he was instead astonished about his enemies’ concealment techniques. He hadn’t detected them at all.

This kind of concealment technique was fairly impressive.

While he was praising their concealment technique, the attacks of his enemies had already arrived.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was astonished, and she felt an urge to step forward and help Ling Han. However, upon recalling his freakish power, she immediately abandoned this thought.

She had personally witnessed Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng combusting their Divine Fetus at that time. Even so, they still hadn’t been able to defeat Ling Han. Could these dozen or so people rival the battle prowess of Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng?

Peng!

Their attacks landed, and the divine light of Regulations burst through the air, triggering a gigantic explosion that caused the entire earth to tremor.

In the distance, everyone was astonished by this sudden sneak attack, and they all turned around to spectate the battle. Ling Han was being attacked by so many people, and several of them were even king tiers. He was definitely going to be killed.

Who told him to be so flagrant and eye-catching?

When the divine light of Regulations vanished, they saw that Ling Han and the Empress were still standing there as if nothing had even happened. They were completely unscathed, and there wasn’t even a single sign of battle on their bodies.

‘This...!’

Shocked, one of the assailants couldn’t help but exclaim, “Impossible!”

Even if Ling Han was capable of blocking all of their attacks, he shouldn’t have been able to do so with such ease!

Ling Han had naturally activated the Banishing Technique on himself and the Empress. With his current strength, his separate dimension naturally couldn’t be shattered by such trash.

Ling Han glanced at that person, and said, “How can you trash understand my true power?”

Peng! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With a single punch, he smashed that person into a cloud of broken flesh and blood.

Upon seeing this, all of his remaining assailants became pale with fright. They hurriedly turned around to flee. There were a dozen or so of them, yet there was only a single Ling Han. As such, he would only be able to catch up to one or two of them at most.

However, they were far too naive.

Whoosh!

With a humph, the Empress summoned 10 Battle Beasts, each of which roared as they lunged toward an assailant.

These Battle Beasts were terrifying, and they viciously incinerated one of the assailants, turning him into ashes in no time.

The spectators almost wet their pants in fright. This couple was far too powerful, no?

Ling Han also launched a casual attack, with an arc of lightning easily disposing of all of the remaining assailants.

He then clapped his hands with a calm expression before holding the Empress’ hand and walking away. It was as if nothing had happened just then.

The spectators exchanged astonished glances with each other. They were speechless with shock. After a brief moment, they finally broke into spirited discussions, sighing with emotion as they discussed Ling Han’s and the Empress’s overwhelming power. Of course, some of them were also admiring the Empress’ breathtaking beauty.

“Humph! So what if he’s freakish? He’s killed Bei Xuanming, so he’ll definitely be killed by the Lunar Sect when he leaves the mystery realm!” someone said with jealousy and hate.

So be it if Ling Han were powerful, yet he even had such a stunningly beautiful wife. Was there still justice in the world?

He had obtained all of the benefits in the entire world!

“Indeed, does he truly think that he can pat his behind and leave after killing the Holy Son of a three-star force?” There was more than one person who was filled with jealousy and hate.

“Heh, when we leave, don’t forget to inform the Lunar Sect of these matters!” someone said. As a spectator, they weren’t afraid of things exploding out of control.

Many people chuckled upon hearing this. Ling Han was supremely powerful, so much so that they could barely breathe in his presence. Thus, they naturally viewed him as a thorn in their side.

Although Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng were also insanely powerful, they were the successors of Celestial King Tier forces. In other words, they were beings that they could only look up to. They didn’t dare to feel jealousy or hatred toward them.

However, who was Ling Han?

He was a measly subordinate of a three-star force. As such, how could his status surpass that of Holy Sons and Holy Daughters?

Pei!

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

At this moment, three figures suddenly descended from the sky. They were none other than Lin Fang, Teng Sen, and Wei Nian.

“Celestial Maiden Lin!”

“Brother Teng!”

“Brother Wei!”

Everyone hurriedly greeted them with respect. These three individuals were all Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, and they were more so extremely talented cultivators. Otherwise, they couldn’t have passed the examination in the Ascending Dragon Palace while the others all failed.

“Why have you three only arrived now?” a Holy Son asked.

Lin Fang pondered for a moment before saying, “It was because of Ling Han, of course!”

Ling Han again?

Everyone faltered upon hearing this.
