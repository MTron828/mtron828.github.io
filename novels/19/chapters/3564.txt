Chapter 3565: Three Conditions

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Seventh Imperial Prince?

At first, Ling Han had thought that this Imperial Prince was a man of great strategies, but as their relationship deepened, he realized that this Imperial Prince was completely selfish. In fact, in order to allow his Spiritual Power to reach Great Accomplishment level, he had even launched a beast tide and massacred an entire city.

Added with the critical factor of Princess Bixiao, they had completely turned against each other, but why had the Seventh Imperial Prince come over at this time?

“Invite him in.” Ling Han thought for a moment, but still decided to meet with this Imperial Prince.

Not long after, a servant led the Seventh Imperial Prince over.

They hadn’t seen each other for several days, and the Seventh Imperial Prince’s cultivation level had once again improved significantly. Every move he made exuded a powerful and intimidating aura. He already had a bit of similarity with Chen Fengyan.

Ling Han chuckled, clasped his hands and said, “Your Imperial Highness.”

The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded, “No need for formalities, Minister Ling.”

Heh, he was really putting on some airs.

Ling Han was in no mood to waste time, and directly asked, “May I know why Your Imperial Highness has come to visit so late at night?”

The Seventh Imperial Prince smiled faintly, “I have come to make a deal with you.”

“Oh, what deal?”

“You agree to my three conditions, and the enmity between you and me will be swept clean from now onwards,” the Seventh Imperial Prince declared proudly, exuding a powerful confidence.

Ling Han was surprised. Where had this Seventh Imperial Prince gotten his confidence from? He actually wanted him to agree to as many as three conditions?

“Firstly, you have to eternally forget about the matter of Huju City.” The Seventh Imperial Prince did not wait for Ling Han to agree, and directly began to talk about his conditions. There was no one else with such confidence, “Secondly, I want you to resign from your position as Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department, and never have any further contact with Princess Bixiao.”

He paused, then continued, “Thirdly, hand over the Heavenly Pattern Jade!”

Why don’t you just go to the heavens while you are at it?

Ling Han laughed in spite of himself, “What makes Your Imperial Highness think that I would agree?”

The Seventh Imperial Prince did not speak, and merely spread out his own aura. Mystery Realm Tier, and peak stage of Mystery Realm Tier at that. Additionally, he also used his Spiritual Power to transform into a blade that slashed out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han activated his Spiritual Power to greet this attack. The two surges of Spiritual Power crashed into each other, yet it was hard to determine who was stronger.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s expression changed slightly. At first, he had thought that after he had advanced into Mystery Realm Tier, his Spiritual Power should be able to overwhelm Ling Han. He had not thought that Ling Han’s Seventh Change would be so powerful, that it was actually not the slightest bit weaker than his.

It should be known that Ling Han was only in Inscription Tier.

This was too inconceivable. Ling Han’s battle prowess was so terrifying, so what right did he have to be so freakish in terms of spiritual power as well?

Only then did he speak, and said, “With the fact that I will very soon advance into Celestial Path, killing you then would be as easy as killing a chicken.”

“Heh, don’t scare me, Your Imperial Highness. I’m a coward,” Ling Han said on purpose. By the looks of it, the Imperial Prince had already lost his patience. He had even used such a low-level threat.

There was nothing else he could do?

However, this made sense. Although the Seventh Imperial Prince was the son of Chen Fengyan, he didn’t have any real power in his hands. At most, he could only rely on his own wealth to raise a private army. However, since this was a private army, he naturally couldn’t use it in public.

Thus, it was possible that the Imperial Princes were more powerful, and it was possible that their secret forces were greater, but in terms of authority, they were inferior to the Four Great Generals, the Council Chairman and the others.

Without this kind of threat from the Seventh Imperial Prince, how could he do anything to the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Oh, then I would really like to experience Your Imperial Highness’s strength.”

“Ling Han, don’t ruin yourself!” the Seventh Imperial Prince said balefully.

This was the last time he would have peace talks with Ling Han. Since he had failed, he would no longer have any extravagant hopes. He would immediately break through to Celestial Path, and then kill Ling Han when he was outside the Imperial City.

—Make a move in the Imperial Capital?

He still wouldn’t dare. His old man was a Spirit Transformation True Lord, so just how powerful was his divine sense?

Precisely because everyone now knew that Chen Fengyan was a Spiritual Transformation Tier elite, the Imperial Princes’ mentality also exploded all of a sudden. F***, so I am actually such an awesome second-generation young master?

A great many Imperial Princes had gone to those sects outside the Imperial Capital to freeload, and the latter did not dare to offend them either, and could only be exploited. This also caused the displeasure of a great many forces, who raised objections to the Foreign Affairs Office.

Ling Han looked at the Seventh Imperial Prince calmly, thinking that he should also deal with these Imperial Princes, and since the Seventh Imperial Prince had jumped out, then he would make an example of him.

“Your Imperial Highness, seven days ago, you went to the Jiang Ming Sect, right?” Ling Han suddenly asked as he flipped through the file.

The Seventh Imperial Prince was taken aback. Why did he suddenly ask about this?

He sneered, “Do I need to report to you where I have gone and where I have gone?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, “If Your Imperial Highness has gone to some brothel or casino, then I naturally would not ask too many questions. However, Your Imperial Highness has gone to the Jiang Ming Sect, and this is related to me.” “Humph, I can’t be bothered to waste my time on you.” The Seventh Imperial Prince flicked his sleeves and turned to leave. Since they could not come to an agreement, they naturally parted on bad terms.

Ling Han leaped over and stopped the Seventh Imperial Prince, saying, “His Majesty has commanded that the Foreign Affairs Department deal with the various sects and forces, yet Your Imperial Highness has gone to the Jiang Ming Sect to freeload. Hehe, this is not a good trend, and would make others think that our Dark North Nation is so poor that even an Imperial Prince can’t support himself!”

“Ling Han!” The Seventh Imperial Prince was furious. Are you calling me a beggar or a rascal? He said balefully, “I am an Imperial Prince, how dare you! Not only are you accusing me, you even dare to stop me?”

Ling Han was unconcerned, and said calmly, “Since His Majesty has entrusted me with this task, I naturally have to complete it dutifully. So what if you are an Imperial Prince? In front of the laws of the nation, you are no different from a commoner!”

“Ha, I would really like to see what you dare to do!” The Seventh Imperial Prince strode forwards.

Ling Han moved, and grabbed out at the Seventh Imperial Prince.

“How dare you!” The Seventh Imperial Prince humphed coldly, and immediately delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han.

Peng! The two of them exchanged a blow, and the Seventh Imperial Prince’s expression instantly changed drastically. He stumbled back in retreat.

He was shocked to the extreme. Ling Han was only a mere Inscription Tier, but not only was his spiritual power no weaker than his, even his mystical power was the same?

What kind of f*cking Inscription Tier was this?

“Hehe, Your Imperial Highness knows that you are in the wrong, and took the initiative to surrender. I am quite impressed,” Ling Han said with a smile, and continued to move to capture him. At present, he could sweep aside all other Mystery Realm Tier-level elites, and setting aside the matter of Spiritual Power, the Seventh Imperial Prince’s strength could only be considered ordinary, so how could he possibly be a match for him?

The Seventh Imperial Prince hurriedly retreated, his expression livid.

Judging by Ling Han’s words, he wanted to force him to confess. He had clearly come to threaten Ling Han, yet in the end, it was him who had come to surrender?

’F*ck off!’

He activated his Spiritual Power, which transformed into a sharp blade that slashed toward Ling Han.

Spiritual Power was formless, and could only be sensed by Spiritual Power itself.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This speed was too fast, and directly slashed into Ling Han’s mind, but Ling Han’s Spiritual Power was also overwhelmingly strong. With a casual shake, this blade of Spiritual Power was shattered, and it could not manage to cause the slightest bit of damage.

The Seventh Imperial Prince roared loudly, and all the chairs, tables and vases in the hall floated up, then shot rapidly towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was unconcerned. Without treasures like the Heavenly Pattern Jade, at least Spiritual Power below the Celestial Path wasn’t terrifying, especially when he himself had cultivated a powerful Spiritual Power. It was absolutely impossible to use Spiritual Power to directly kill his spirit.

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han merely used his Spiritual Power as a net, and the chairs and tables that were tossed over all stopped in their tracks.

Xiu, right at this moment, a cold light shot out rapidly.

The Seventh Imperial Prince finally used his trump card..
