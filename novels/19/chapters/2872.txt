2873 Yet another dimension

The elder in red robes was extremely furious. He had never suffered such a great humiliation before, and it made him want to commit murder.

However, as Ling Han’s punches landed on his face one after another, the chill in his heart grew endlessly.

He was no match for this young man.

In this world, no matter how great the heaven and earth was, or how great the logic was, it was not more important than strength. Whoever was stronger would be able to crush all living beings and do whatever they wanted.

Thus, his anger and defiance were all fake. If he continued to fight head-on like this, he would be done for.

Furthermore, after calming down, he discovered that Ling Han was not only stronger than him in terms of Heavenly Venerable Seals, but he also had the upper hand in terms of raw power. The elder’s power was roughly at the middle stage of the Fourth Tier, but Ling Han was at the late stage of the Fourth Tier.

Therefore, with the amplification of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, the difference in battle prowess between the two of them became even greater.

Peng!

Before he could finish his thought, he was sent flying again. Peng, peng, peng! Under the terrifying pressure, he destroyed an unknown amount of ground layers along the way with the impact.

He was greatly alarmed. They had already been close to the land’s heart, and now that they were so deep underground, it was likely that a hollow would appear at any moment, revealing the core of the dimension.

The core of a transcendent dimension was incomparably terrifying, and even Seventh Tiers couldn’t retrieve it. Now, even if this core had already been destroyed, just like how a dying tiger would still be mighty, perhaps Fourth Tier cultivators could still be killed by it.

If he really died like this, he wouldn’t be able to accept it even if he became a ghost. It would be too unfair to him.

“Junior, we can talk peacefully—”

Peng! He hadn’t even finished speaking when he was already struck by another punch from Ling Han. His body involuntarily flew backwards. Peng, peng, peng! Like a sharp spear, nothing could stop his advance as he sank deeper and deeper into the ground.

All of a sudden, he felt a lightness behind him—there was actually no ground layer blocking him.

He was first taken aback, then shocked. He suddenly realized that they had probably reached the core of the dimension.

All of a sudden, the hair on his body stood on ends.

However, he immediately revealed a look of surprise.

How was this the core of the dimension? It was a completely new world.

Peng! Ling Han also followed closely behind, similarly revealing a look of surprise.

He had actually entered a new world. There were mountains, great rivers, and seas here, but all of them were dried up now, leaving behind one massive depression after another, grains of sand filling the air.

Strange, too strange.

There was no dimensional core here. Although it did disappoint Ling Han, he wouldn’t be too concerned. After all, countless years had passed, so it was normal for the dimensional core to be destroyed.

However, the scene in front of him now was too shocking.

He couldn’t care less about the elder in red robes now. He unleashed his divine sense to probe this world.

“Husband.” The Empress and Hu Niu also appeared, their faces also showing surprise. What kind of place was this?

Ling Han’s expression became solemn, and he said, “This is a dimension.”

“Aren’t we presently in this primitive dimension?” Hu Niu asked in confusion.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This dimension… is different from that dimension.”

“You’re saying that these are two dimensions?” Understanding dawned on the Empress, and her expression also became solemn.

“There’s such a strange thing?” Hu Niu was also stunned, and she tilted her head. “Dimensions are isolated from dimensions, and a Two-Realm Passageway can connect two dimensions, but is this considered a Two-Realm Passageway?”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “This is definitely not a Two-Realm Passageway.”

They had traveled through the Two-Realm Passageways of the whole Genesis World. It could be said that they were extremely familiar with Two-Realm Passageways, but this was definitely not the case now.

“But I’m certain that this is definitely not a transcendent dimension,” Ling Han concluded. “It’s definitely two different dimensions.”

The three of them looked at each other, and gradually came to a conclusion.

“Could it be that a supreme elite made a move and forcibly compressed the two dimensions together?”

The Empress muttered to herself, “Even a Seventh Tier elite would not be able to compress transcendent dimensions together. At the very least, a single Seventh Tier elite could not.”

Ling Han nodded. The two dimensions overlapped. Was this natural or man-made? If it was man-made, what kind of mighty power would be needed to achieve this?

He knew that this dimension definitely possessed astonishing secrets, but this scene still far exceeded his imagination.

On the other side, the elder in red robes also slowly came to his senses. It was actually easier for him than Ling Han to confirm this because he was in the Fourth Tier, and had been in contact with three types of fundamental powers.

He could say with certainty that the three fundamental powers he mastered were clearly weaker here.

Previously, the primitive dimension was a transcendent dimension, but this was a high-level dimension. There was an entire level of difference.

He racked his brains, but no matter how hard he thought, he could not figure out how this could have happened.

“A new dimension, does that mean there would be new veins of ore here?” The Empress’s eyes lit up. She actually wasn’t the type to be very curious, because she didn’t care at all, so she immediately thought of something else.

Ling Han was also delighted. This was a new dimension.

Since he couldn’t figure it out, there was no point in thinking about it.

He looked at the elder in red robes. In that instant, he felt an urge to kill him to ensure his silence.

The elder in red robes couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine, and he hurriedly broke into a run and fled.

Heavenly Venerable Tier elites were hard to kill, especially when they were of the same cultivation level. As long as one of them fled first, it was simply impossible for their opponent to catch up to them.

Ling Han did not give chase. Since two groups of people had already entered this place, it meant that there were many people who had their sights set on the underground. It was possible that other forces had already entered this dimension from different entrances.

“Let’s make the first move.”

They immediately began their exploration, searching for veins of ore.

The result didn’t disappoint them. Very quickly, they found a vein of ore, and within it were three Heavenly Venerable Seals. However, Ling Han had already mastered these three, so he let the Empress and Hu Niu divide these seals between themselves.

They continued to advance. They had to hurry up. Otherwise, when the various great forces focused their attention on them, this place would become just like the dimension aboveground, where the resources would be quickly divided up among the major forces.

...

Time flew by. After tens of thousands of years, this place gradually became lively, and more and more forces came here.

Ling Han and the others silently made a fortune. They were the first batch of people to enter this place, and Ling Han’s ability to detect new veins of ore was so powerful. With this head start, it allowed them to make a fortune. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Here’s another vein of ore,” Ling Han said.

They were currently in a dried-up sea. Originally, this place was an oceanic trench, and it was extremely deep.

“Hurry up and dig, hurry up and dig,” Hu Niu urged.

Ling Han smiled, and used his great ability to directly extract the entire vein of ore, and then divided it in half, extracting whatever valuable objects there were.

“Hm?” He suddenly frowned.

“What is it?” the Empress asked.

“Someone’s coming. He’s very strong!” Ling Han said, looking into the distance.

Xiu! A figure came from the horizon, emitting a terrifying aura, as if even the heavens had to bow in submission.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. “Meng Dong!”

...

Shockingly, the newcomer was Meng Dong.

He had fought Meng Dong before. Although Meng Dong had admitted defeat in the end, he had not actually lost.

This was a powerful opponent.

“Little Brother, we meet again!” Meng Dong stopped and nodded at Ling Han. “Now you know who I am, right?”
