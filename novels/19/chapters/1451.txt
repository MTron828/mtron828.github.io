Chapter 1452 Light of Dao

“Heavens, I would not be able to take on any of his Mystical Powers.”

“This is what a true king tier is, capable of crushing all his peers.”

“I now believe that Ling Han could really defeat Gu Daoyi.”

“It would be quite difficult to do so, but it is very possible that the two of them would end with a tie.”

“I still think Gu Daoyi is stronger. He obviously still has more secret techniques that he hasn’t used, but Ling Han just keeps using that same sword technique.”

“Don’t tell me that you don’t know that it is unwise to be greedy? Merely mastering one secret technique to the utmost is enough; what need would there be to waste time on other techniques? No matter what kind of opponent he encounters, it would be enough for him to kill them with a single strike, right?”

“Humph, what’s wrong with having a lot of secret techniques? He could choose which secret technique to use based on different environments and different opponents. This is called adapting to the conditions.”

Everyone began fiercely debating, and naturally, none of them were convinced of the opinions of the others.

In the air, Ling Han’s Lightning Sword Technique had also begun a clash with Gu Daoyi’s Flying Flower Sword Technique.

When the Flying Flower Sword moved, there appeared dazzlingly beautiful flowers in the heaven and earth, but there was killing intent hidden among these exquisite blooms. When the flowers bloomed, Divine Swords shot out one after another in a brilliant display.

Ling Han humphed. Lightning spread out, issuing punishment on behalf of the heavens.

Boom, boom, boom, boom. One after another, the flowers exploded, turning into dust. In a clash of sword techniques, the Lightning Sword Technique was completely victorious!

Gu Daoyi couldn’t help but look livid.

In a clash of sword techniques, this was a clash of Sword Dao, especially when both of their sword techniques touched upon Heavenly Dao. Thus, this had developed into a competition of the grade of their sword techniques, and it was obvious that the Flying Flower Sword Technique was completely defeated.

Boom, lightning flashed all around them, turning into an ocean that barraged towards him.

Gu Daoyi had no choice but to retreat and place all his focus on defenses.

When the lightning had disappeared, though he was still standing proudly like a mountain, his hair was disheveled and clothes ripped, and he still revealed a sorry appearance.

“Gasp!”

“In this clash, Ling Han completely has the upper hand!”

“It is not just the upper hand; he has an overwhelming advantage. He has completely shattered Gu Daoyi’s sword technique.”

“Sigh!” The powerful figure from the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy said, “Both of them are extraordinarily talented. The competition of sword techniques just now had developed to the extent of Sword Dao. Otherwise, even if Gu Daoyi had not been his match, he could not have possibly looked so pitiful now.”

“The level of Sword Dao?” A great many people were confused, and humbly voiced their question.

“Putting all other factors aside, the competition is in terms of the height of Sword Dao. Whoever is slightly superior would emerge with an absolute victory, and the losing side will only crumble completely,” the mighty figure explained.

“Oh!” Realization dawned on everyone. No wonder Gu Daoyi looked so pitiful. That was because he had lost in the clash of Sword Dao. It could be considered that he had delivered the sword strike just now for nothing, only dissipating this attack from Ling Han, so he was naturally very strained.

This had no relation to Gu Daoyi’s own abilities. It was purely that the sword technique he cultivated was no match for the other’s sword technique.

“I really never thought that a battle between two mere Heavenly Body Tiers would actually advance to the level of Sword Dao,” the powerful figure mused ruefully. Though cultivators had always been pursuing the Dao of Heaven and Earth, those that had really grasped the essence of Dao would have already reached the Genesis Tier.

If one was to compare himself to another, he’d just die from ire!

When everyone heard this, they were even more shocked. They were all in the Heavenly Body Tier, but how far behind had they been left by Gu Daoyi and Ling Han?

Gu Daoyi tidied his appearance. He was a supreme king tier, so he naturally could not forget his bearing. He frowned slightly. He had actually lost to Ling Han in terms of Sword Dao; this was astonishing to him.

It should be known that the Flying Flower Sword Technique was a celestial technique, and yet it was no match for Ling Han’, which was proof that the sword technique Ling Han had grasped had attained what kind of level?

If he knew that this was a sword technique that Ling Han had invented by himself, his mouth would definitely twist in absolute shock.

It was not uncommon to create one’s own technique, but to be able to reach the level of Dao, and more so completely defeat the Flying Flower Sword Technique with it, this was shocking! Even in the Celestial Realm, this was not something that any random elite could do.

His killing intent burned even brighter. If he had only seen Ling Han as a mere ant in the past, now he had no choice but to consider him as a thorn in his side that he had to remove.

The fortune of the heaven and earth was a very mysterious entity. He had buried his body of nine lives, and emerged as a Divine Fetus in this lifetime, yet he had encountered Ling Han. This was a destined battle between himself and Ling Han.

The two of them... Only one of them could win, and the loser would be abandoned by the heaven and earth, while all the fortune would be transferred onto the victor.

He was sure of this fact.

Thus, he had to win.

From this moment onwards, every battle between the two of them meant that they were snatching the fortune from the other, right until one of them collapsed.

‘Mystical Power of the seventh lifetime, Nine Winds Kick!’ Gu Daoyi said internally. He kicked out his leg. Shua, shua, shua, endless blades of Dao swept out, forming divine patterns that sliced towards Ling Han. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With a flick of his finger, Ling Han was still using the Lightning Sword Technique. Aside from the Tide of the Ages, this was his strongest technique at the moment. Moreover, this was his self-invented technique, and as his comprehension of the Dao of Heaven and Earth became deeper, its might would become even stronger.

One day, it would not be strange for this technique to surpass Tide of the Ages.

‘Why does it have to surpass the Tide of the Ages?’

Enlightenment rose up in Ling Han once more. Why could he not infuse Tide of the Ages into the Lightning Sword Technique? His sword technique would bring with it the power of time, and crumble the attack and defenses of his opponent. One strike would attack his opponent’s body, or even cause him to age?

A bright luster that was out of this world exuded from him.

“Light, Light of Dao!” That powerful figure of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was dumbfounded, and looked as if he had seen a ghost. He murmured, “Only those that had created a supreme cultivation technique could be acknowledged by the heaven and earth and be enshrouded by the Light of Dao! This, this, this... This is inconceivable. Could it be that he has invented his own sword technique? Otherwise, how could he possibly be enshrouded by the Light of Dao?”

Light of Dao!

A self-created sword technique that had gained the acknowledgement of heaven and earth?

Gods!

When the others heard this mighty figure’s murmur, they all involuntarily became numb with shock. They could only feel disbelief as they broke out into a cold sweat.

What kind of prodigy was this?

Gods!

Ling Han began to attempt infusing the Tide of the Ages into the Lightning Sword Technique. As his attack unfolded, the power of time wafted out. Though its might was still very weak, it was already a very good start.

Gu Daoyi returned once more with failure.

In truth, this was very normal. Though he had grasped many secret techniques, he could not use more than one at a time. In that case, what was the difference between one secret technique and 100?

No matter how much he switched secret techniques, their might was about the same.

“Mystical Power of the eighth life, A Hundred Ghosts Cloud Heavens!”

Boom, endless darkness was released from within Gu Daoyi’s body, but it similarly could only extend about six meters upwards and downwards, appearing extremely bizarre. Amidst the darkness, ghoulish creatures appeared one after another. They were obviously as tall as 300 meters, yet were forced to shrink into an area of six meters, so all of them were crouching.

Initially, these ghoulish creatures were very frightening, hideous and terrifying, but now all of them were crouching, and they appeared to be very hilarious, causing a great many people to break out into laughter uncontrollably.

Gu Daoyi, meanwhile, appeared very embarrassed. With a point of his finger, these ghoulish creatures suddenly shrank in size, and became only about three meters tall. Only then were they able to stand upright.

However, in this way, these ghoulish creatures finally exuded the frightening aura that they should have. An evil air was exuding from them, causing everyone to shiver just from seeing them.

“This, this is a technique of the Netherworld!”

“It’s too evil, it’s filled with destruction!”

“How did Gu Daoyi learn a technique of the Netherworld?”
