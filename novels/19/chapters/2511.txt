Chapter 2512: Forceful Purchase

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

To most people, the Celestial King Tier was in sight but unreachable. Thus, it was every person’s dream to reach this lofty height.

Xu Qiang also wore an expression of yearning. He completely agreed with Tang Chi’s words, so he didn’t continue to tease his friend.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “As long as you put in the effort, perhaps there’ll be a sliver of hope.”

“Tsk, what cultivation level are you at? Yet you’re actually trying to console us?” Xu Qiang and Tang Chi playfully chided. They both recovered back to their jovial selves.

If Ling Han wanted to, he could give both of them a Celestial King Pill, allowing them to immediately become Celestial Kings. However, they would be forever stuck at this level, with no chance to ever grow stronger.

Besides, he had left all of his Celestial King Pills in the Celestial Realm. Moreover, he wasn’t that generous, either. These two people were not yet his friends, and Ling Han was more so not a stupidly nice person.

He involuntarily thought to himself, just how good would business be if he sold Celestial King Pills here?

However, did a Celestial Path exist here?

If a Celestial Path didn’t exist, how would he obtain Celestial Seeds? If he couldn’t obtain Celestial Seeds, how would he refine Celestial King Pills?

Forget about it, there was no point thinking about this anymore.

He returned to the stand that he had been at before, picking up the cauldron, and asking, “What’s the price for this item?”

“100,000,000 Star Stones!” the middle-aged man said. At the same time, he even raised a single finger to stress his point.

“You might as well rob someone!” Tang Chi exclaimed in anger. This cauldron didn’t exude any might, and what use was its stupid sturdiness? Perhaps they would use it to smack someone?

......

“If you want to buy it, then that’s the price. I’m not forcing you to buy it, am I?” the middle-aged man said with a chuckle. He turned his gaze away from Tang Chi, and it was as if he viewed him with complete disdain.

“You’re angering me to death!” Tang Chi shouted.

Ling Han didn’t have so many Star Stones with him. He pondered for a moment before saying, “I don’t have so many Star Stones on me. However, look at this item. Do you need it?”

He retrieved a fire-element crystal, handing it over to the middle-aged man.

The man didn’t take him seriously, and this was mainly because Ling Han’s cultivation level was far too low. What valuable items could he possess? However, he immediately screamed in pain upon accepting the fire-element crystal. In fact, he almost threw it away.

It was hot, far too hot.

“What are you doing? If you break it, can you afford the compensation?” Tang Chi chided. He immediately seized this opportunity to berate the middle-aged man. He then bent down to pick the crystal up.

However, he involuntarily yelped upon picking it up.

Pa!

The crystal was dropped to the ground again.

“Pff!” Xu Qiang burst into laughter. “Say, Brother Tang, is there any need to tease others like this? You even copied him dropping the item! This is Brother Ling’s item, so how will you compensate him if you truly break it?”

He bent down to pick the crystal up. However, he immediately exclaimed in astonishment upon touching the crystal. Even his face became green.

It was far too hot. Was that still a crystal? It was clearly the essence of fire!

The middle-aged man finally came to his senses. He wore a serious expression as he walked out from behind his stand. He reached over with his right hand, yet this time, there was a layer of Regulations around his hand. He then grabbed the crystal.

An expression of wild delight instantly spread across his face. “Is this a concentrated crystal of the Regulations of Fire? It possesses the terrifying Great Dao of Fire within it. If I obtain enough of such crystals, I might even be able to comprehend the complete Great Dao of Fire and advance to the Celestial King Tier!”

Tang Chi and Xu Qiang were both astonished upon hearing this. This scalding hot crystal was actually this impressive?

They exchanged a glance before shaking their heads. One of them practiced the Regulations of Wood, while one of them practiced the Regulations of Earth. Both of these had nothing to do with the Regulations of Fire.

“Huh? You retrieved it with your hand just then, so why wasn’t your hand burned?” Tang Chi suddenly exclaimed. He was no fool, and he immediately noticed this problem. He looked at Ling Han in astonishment.

Xu Qiang was also astounded. He hurriedly grabbed Ling Han’s hand, spreading it open to observe. It was as smooth as jade. Where were the burn marks?

How strange!

He hurriedly grabbed Ling Han’s other hand. However, it was also uninjured.

Even the middle-aged man clicked his tongue in wonder. They had all examined the might of this crystal, and they discovered that it was difficult to hold it even with the power of regulations wrapped around their hands. They could still feel the devastating heat of the crystal, and it was only just barely manageable.

With such a lowly cultivation, how had Ling Han managed to hold this crystal with no problems at all?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Perhaps my skin is thick and tough.”

This was the blatant truth. His physique was at the Second Heaven. Moreover, this crystal had only been refined from the earth fire, so its might naturally wasn’t comparable to that of origin fire. As such, he could handle it with ease.

“How many of these crystals do you have?” the middle-aged man asked. He was extremely enticed by these crystals, so much so that he couldn’t be bothered figuring out why Ling Han hadn’t been burned. After all, many things in this world couldn’t be explained.

“10,” Ling Han replied. He naturally possessed more than 10, but wasn’t business all about haggling? He wasn’t running a charity, after all.

The middle-aged man hesitated upon hearing this. He had found this cauldron in an ancient tomb that was most likely several epochs old. He knew this because he had asked someone to appraise some other items for him, allowing him to determine the age of the tomb.

He was adamant that this cauldron was special, and it was because of this that he had priced it at 100,000,000 Star Stones. However, he couldn’t list any redeeming quality of this cauldron apart from its sturdy nature. As such, he didn’t have the confidence to haggle.

So be it, he would take 10 of these crystals. He didn’t want to wait any longer.

He gritted his teeth, nodding, and said, “Alright, deal!”

“Wait!” Right at this moment, a large hand suddenly reached over, grabbing at the cauldron.

While they were haggling just then, the middle-aged man had also taken the cauldron back. He was completely unprepared at this moment, and the cauldron was just about to be taken by that person.

Peng!

However, Ling Han suddenly launched a kick, striking the middle-aged man. A burst of power surged over, causing his body to involuntarily contort. At the same time, the cauldron just swung out of reach of the large hand.

“Hmm?” The person who had reached over was astonished. The middle-aged man had contorted in an extremely clever manner, actually causing him to miss.

This was absolutely incredible.

“Lord Yang Zhixuan!” Tang Chi and Xu Qiang both exclaimed in astonishment. The person who had interfered… was actually Yang Zhixuan!

Yang Zhixuan had also felt a sudden urge when he saw the cauldron. He also couldn’t identify anything special about the cauldron, but since he had felt a sudden urge, he had to buy it to investigate no matter what.

“Hand it over!” he said in a deep voice, with his might as a Celestial King booming through the surroundings.

The middle-aged man involuntarily shuddered. “But Lord, I’ve already sold the cauldron to him!” he said as he pointed to Ling Han. He didn’t give in after being frightened. He still maintained his integrity. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Zhixuan peered down at Ling Han, his eyes full of disdain. Such a measly person dared to compete with him? What a hilarious joke!

He frowned, and said, “How many Star Stones? I’ll pay double!”

“This…” The middle-aged man hesitated upon hearing this. In reality, he was in greater need of the fire-element crystals. After all, these crystals would give him a sliver of hope to reach the Celestial King Tier.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “If you had arrived earlier, you could have competed fairly, with the highest bidder obtaining the cauldron. However, we’ve already settled on a price and made a deal, yet you still insist on forcefully purchasing the item. You’re showing such wanton disregard for the rules!”

Xu Qiang and Tang Chi instantly went pale upon hearing this.

That was Yang Zhixuan! To say nothing of his identity as a follower of Heavenborn, he was still a mighty Celestial King! In fact, he had just defeated a proper disciple who was a Second Heaven Celestial King!

If one talked back to him, one would definitely suffer a tragic end!
