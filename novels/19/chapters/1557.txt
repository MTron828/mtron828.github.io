Chapter 1558 Uninvited gues

“Mo Li, you are really too awesome!” Wu Jue soon caught up with Mo Li. “When that guy has gone off to the Ocean Dragon Mountains, I will be able to be alone with Sister. I will definitely manage to convince her to leave that damn guy.”Mo Li glanced at him unemotionally. “For this trip to the Ocean Dragon Mountains, you will be going as well!”“What?” Wu Jue was stunned, and then repeatedly shook his head. “I’m not going! I’m still young, so it would be better for me to earnestly cultivate here.”

“The Ocean Dragon Mountains only opens once every few million years. The next time it opens, you will already be in the Eternal River Tier,” Mo Li said. “For the opportunity of the Ocean Dragon Mountains, the earlier you go, the better it is for you!”

“I don’t want to! I don’t want to!” Wu Jue began to act shamelessly. “I managed to draw that guy away after so much hardship; I want to be alone with Sister!”

“I was not asking for your opinion; I was informing you,” Mo Li said coldly, not giving the slightest face to this little master.

“I will speak with Father!” Wu Jue exclaimed angrily.

“Hoho.” Mo Li put on a fake smile.

Clearly, Wu Jue failed. Three days later, he appeared on the namelist of 10 people.

The 10 entering were Ling Han, Mo Li, Wu Jue, Chi Huangji, and six other astonishingly talented disciples. In truth, Mo Li would not be able to gain much benefit by entering into the Ocean Dragon Mountains anymore. She was entering as a protector, to protect her junior sisters and junior brothers.

Ling Han was not received cordially, because he, an outsider, had actually occupied one place of entry into the Ocean Dragon Mountains. This was something that disciples like them had worked hard for innumerable years to finally attain, and in his case?

He got it the moment he came, and he was an outsider at that!

But this was something that Mo Li had personally decided, and Lord Demon Master did not disagree, either. How could they possibly dare to say anything else?

The Hysteria Demon Master escorted them personally. If they had boarded a starship, it would take too much time.

A golden pathway stretched out, and with a flutter of the Hysteria Demon Master’s sleeve, he gathered all 10 of them and travelled into the galaxy.

The distance this time was even further. After a whole 17 days, they finally arrived at a barren, desolate planet. This was a dead planet. There was no Spiritual Qi, no life, yet it was where the Ocean Dragon Mountains were located.

At this time, not only one Demon Master had arrived. This kind of powerful existence was each the center of the universe and incredibly dazzling.

The Hysteria Demon Master went to greet these fellow elites, and the juniors also got acquainted with one another. Some of them were even rivals.

“Mo Li, how many years has it been since we last met?” A man walked over. He looked very young, but should already be a few dozen million years old. However, his cultivation level was too high, already in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, and so his appearance still looked very, very young.

Mo Li looked at him naturally and nodded her head. She had greeted him.

“You and I have fought seven times. You have won four times, and I have won three times. Why don’t we fight our eighth time now? I should also pull the score to tie at four against four!” this man said, his face filled with absolute confidence.

Being able to fight with Mo Li seven times, and the stronger between the two of them was practically undecided? He was indeed very strong.

“That guy’s name is Zhu Ba, but we all call him Zhu Ba[1].” Wu Jue took on the role of commentator on his own initiative. “It is said that after the first time Mo Li defeated Zhu Ba, he began to pursue Mo Li. Aside from him, there is no one else that has fought as many as seven times with Mo Li.”

Mo Li was cool, neither accepting nor refusing the challenge.

Zhu Ba actually did not really want to start a fight with Mo Li. He only wanted to use that chance to talk with her. Now that this goal had been achieved, he naturally would not be aggressive, and became very humble instead.

A few days later, more Demon Masters arrived. One after another, golden pathways stretched out. They were all escorting their own juniors and disciples over. The Overlord Sword Demon Master had also arrived. Aside from Zhu Xuan, there were nine other disciples, and not a single place of entry was wasted.

When Zhu Xuan spotted Ling Han, she couldn’t help but look pleasantly surprised, but when her eyes fell on Wu Jue, she involuntarily humphed coldly, and proudly turned her head away.

On the day before the Ocean Dragon Mountains opened, all the Demon Masters had arrived. It was said that the Ocean Dragon Mountains was suspected to contain power on the level of a Black Demon, and thus every time it opened, there would have to be Demon Masters personally there on standby just in case.

In the Netherworld, Demon Masters naturally were also divided into four grades, which were Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow Demons, respectively. Heaven Demon corresponded to Saint King, and Yellow Demon was equivalent to Small Saint.

The Hysteria Demon Master and the others were all Yellow Demons, and were still unable to enter into the Ocean Dragon Mountains and suppress everything. Furthermore, if they entered, it would result in a powerful backlash from the Ocean Dragon Mountains. In previous years, it had even led to the death of a Demon Master, so no other Demon Master dared to enter again now.

When people beneath Demon Master level entered, they would not alert this force. It seemed like they were too weak, so it couldn’t be bothered to deal with them.

There were a total of 17 Demon Masters, and 170 people entering. Some of them were well-established elites, and were even just a step away from becoming Demon Masters themselves, such as Mo Li. There were also complete rookies, just like Wu Jue. He was only over 100 years old, and his personality was even more childlike.

A day passed, and when the sun rose up from the horizon of the barren land, a loud commotion was heard. A mountain peak broke through the ground. What was surprising was the fact that there was an ocean surrounding the mountain peak in all directions. It floated in midair, and not a single drop of water fell.

This mountain peak was not very high; it was only a few hundred meters tall. The ocean was also not too expansive, but only looked to be violently raging. In truth, it was only a few thousand meters wide. But the truth was when one stepped into this special place, the mountains would become endlessly high, and the ocean would also become boundlessly wide.

It was said that merely crossing the ocean would be enough to cause 90% of the people to reluctantly give up, and among the remaining 10%, there had never been one person that had successfully climbed up to the summit.

From the outside, there was a completely crystalline blue temple at the mountain summit. Vaguely, one could see the stone statue of a True Dragon crouched on top, and that was why it was named the Ocean Dragon Mountains.

This was the Ocean Dragon Mountains Mystery Realm. It looked like it could be entered from all directions, but that was not the truth of the matter, as they would only crash into an invisible wall.

If one wanted to enter, they could only pass through the main doors. That was an arched door that was about three meters tall, and there were multiple True Dragons carved onto the doorposts.

“Quickly enter, you all have three years’ time,” one Demon Master said.

Everyone was just about to move when they saw a golden pathway stretch over. Xiu, in an instant, another six people appeared.

There was an old man that looked to be in his sixties or seventies, and the others were all young people, in the prime of their youth and bursting with vitality.

The 17 Demon Masters all narrowed their eyes. They were the rulers of the galaxies in this surrounding area, and they were naturally aware of all the elites in the area, but they were really not the slightest bit familiar with this old man. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But it just so happened that he was also a Demon Master, and a very strong one at that. He could be considered a big shot among Yellow Demons.

“What a spot of good luck. I just happened to pass by, and actually encountered the opening of a historical site.” The newly arrived Demon Master, the old man, smilingly said, “With such a coincidence, this is preordained fate. You all should enter and seek out your own fortune.”

“Yes, Sixth Elder!” The five young people all nodded respectfully.

“Wait!” The Hysteria Demon Master spoke up. “Friend, as a guest, you are overstepping your boundaries!”
