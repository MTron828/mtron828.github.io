2713 Complete discrimination

Hearing these words from the Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate, everyone was dumbfounded.

Just what kind of discrimination was this?

Everyone was incredibly curious; what astonishing feat had Ling Han actually done that he would be granted this kind of treatment? They truly could not imagine it, because no matter what, Ling Han possessed only Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess.

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” Ma Feng shouted loudly. The veins on his face were popping in anger. There had to some kind of inside story here; this was deliberate discrimination.

“So noisy!” Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate humphed. Boom! A giant hand suddenly descended from the skies, and grabbed out at Ma Feng.

He was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, and explaining to a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was already giving the latter enough face. This mainly was out of consideration for Ma Feng’s grief over losing his son and the fact that he had been battling fiercely with the troops of Hysteria. And in terms of contributions, would he, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, have contributed less than Ma Feng?

Without becoming a true Heavenly Venerate, he would ultimately only be cannon fodder.

Ma Feng could not resist, and was easily grabbed by this giant hand. Then, xiu, he was thrown out of the martial academy with a wave, and all traces of him were gone in an instant.

“Give him a proper burial. Dismissed,” the Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate stated, and no further sound was heard.

‘This…!’

Everyone was gaping. As they saw it, there would have definitely been no way that Ling Han could get out of this, but this calamity actually ended so easily?

Ling Han merely smiled calmly, turned around, and returned inside.

This incident naturally caused a massive tsunami in the martial academy, and also scared another second-generation young master half to death, and that was Zhuo Kai. His father would also be taking his turn to return from the Realm Battlefield and rest. He also had plans to use his father to bully Ling Han.

Thankfully, he hadn’t.

He patted his chest continuously in lingering fear. Otherwise, the person that would be lying dead would have been him. Furthermore, Ling Han would escape punishment. If that really happened, he would not be able to close his eyes even in death.

…To say the least, he was still not a real disciple of the martial academy, so even if he died, that would be a worthless death.

After Ling Han dealt with all the trifling matters, he and the large black dog set off to the Lin Clan. Wally, however, had no interest in going to the Realm Battlefield. He had always advertised himself as an analytical model; fighting and killing were not things that he should be doing.

After over a dozen days’ journey, they arrived once more at the Lin Clan.

“You have actually broken through to the Ninth Heaven!” Lin Piaoxue was still at Lin Clan, and when she knew that Ling Han had returned, she especially went to meet him. She couldn’t help but feel very rueful. “I have also heard some of your feats; you now possess strength capable of matching the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

Ling Han smiled. “I have to thank your father for his kindness, as well as you, Miss Lin, for your guidance.”

Previously, Lin Piaoxue had kept playing the role of his sparring partner. For a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to lower herself to do such a thing was a very great kindness.

Lin Piaoxue also smiled. “Come, let us have a spar and see just what level you have attained.”

The two of them rose into the air, and a clash broke out between them.

“Whatever ultimate moves you have, just use them freely,” Lin Piaoxue said. At this moment, she was no longer the gentle daughter of a noble clan, but a female warrior of the battlefield.

Ling Han held nothing back, and went all out.

The two of them battled for about two hours before stopping.

Lin Piaoxue had many compliments for him. “Going by your cultivation level, you can only be considered an early-stage Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier in terms of Body Arts, but your physique has reached the late stage. This is extremely inconceivable. Furthermore, your physique is incredibly tough, and along with this kind of battle prowess, you would not have to fear even a peak-stage Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier elite.”

Ling Han naturally knew this, but he still smiled modestly. “Thank you for your compliment, Miss Lin.”

“It is all thanks to Grandpa Dog’s teachings,” the large black dog piped in shamelessly from the sidelines.

Neither Lin Piaoxue nor Ling Han gave him any regard, and they continued their conversation. The large black dog almost went mad at this; they actually dared to ignore him.

“Are you going to the Realm Battlefield after this?” Lin Piaoxue asked.

Ling Han nodded. He wanted to rapidly increase his cultivation level through bloody battles and reach peak-stage Ninth Heaven. That way, he would be able to extract Void Particle Energy, and directly advance to become a First Tier Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, this kind of First Tier Heavenly Venerate was definitely the strongest of his cultivation level—others were using that unique energy of the realm, which could not be compared with Void Particle Energy.

Only after becoming a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would his advantage over his peers disappear.

“That’s good. You do not have any opponents here already. If you were to cultivate alone here, the time for you to reach the peak stage would be far from sight.” Lin Piaoxue nodded, and looked like she wanted to say something, but was hesitant to do so.

“Miss Lin, is there something else?” Ling Han asked.

Lin Piaoxue hesitated, and then said, “Though your natural talent is extraordinary, I have to remind you that the true prodigies are actually all at the Realm Battlefield.”

Ling Han nodded. He had heard Lin Piaoxue speak of this before. For example, the clansmen nurtured by the Lin Clan would not be sent to the martial academy, but would rather be cultivating in their clan itself, and after attaining a certain cultivation, they would be directly sent to battle in the Realm Battlefield.

In the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, Ling Han had seen the descendants of Third Tier or even Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, but there were none from Fifth Tier or Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, what more a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate.

The Realm Battlefield was a slaughterhouse, but it was also the most suitable place for one to grow and mature. The strong would prevail, while the weak would be discarded. All that survived were elites; there was no one mediocre among them.

“I understand,” Ling Han said.

Lin Piaoxue nodded. “You don’t understand.” She paused, and then continued, “Do you think that circumstances like yours are considered unique?”

Ling Han was instantly moved, and then asked, “There are others like me?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Lin Piaoxue nodded slowly. “Under the pressure of the threat of Hysteria destroying the world, the whole Genesis World has also welcomed a great burst of talent. As far as I know, there are two that have possessed strength capable of matching, or even killing, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate when they were in the Ninth Heaven.”

“Who?” Ling Han asked, feeling only curiosity and fighting spirit. He did not feel the slightest bit of jealousy.

Lin Piaoxue glanced at him in admiration, and then said, “One of them is named Xin Qihu, and is truly a supreme prodigy. He has taken even less time than you to reach the Ninth Heaven. However, his father is a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, Lord Xin Fu. Since childhood, his cultivation resources and environment were who knows how many times better than yours, so there is no need for you to take it to heart.”

Ling Han nodded slowly, and then asked, “Then what is Xin Qihu’s cultivation level now?”

Lin Piaoxue’s words were about when Xin Qihu was in the Ninth Heaven, and not what battle prowess he presently possessed.

“Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!” Lin Piaoxue said solemnly, a hint of admiration in her eyes. “Up till today, he has only been cultivating for 700,000,000 years!”

700,000,000 years?

A great many Celestial Kings might not be able to advance a single Heaven in a whole epoch, but Xin Qihu had already become a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate in 700,000,000 years. This kind of talent in cultivation was too amazing.

Ling Han nodded. “I hope I can spar with him one day.” His eyes were bright. This kind of prodigy was definitely worth a battle.

Lin Piaoxue was surprised. ‘He is already a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, so why do you think that you can catch up to him?’

But Ling Han was definitely not the type to be blindly confident. That expression of high spirits on his face caused others to involuntarily believe his words.

“And the other?” Ling Han asked.

“The other…” Lin Piaoxue smiled. “That would be my youngest aunt, my grandfather’s youngest daughter. Her name is Lin Youlian, and her freakish talent is not inferior to Xin Qihu’s at all. At present, she, too, is a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“It should be known that Aunty is considerably younger than even me!”

That was indeed freakish talent. Was this a descendant born from a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate? From birth, she was already powerful, and possessed immeasurable future prospects?

Ling Han’s heart jolted. Suddenly, he asked a completely unrelated question. “Why is your name Piaoxue?”
