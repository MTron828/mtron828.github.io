Chapter 3296 - 3296: Beaten for nothing

Translator: Henyee Translations    Editor: Henyee Translations

“Rebel, are you planning to rebel!” Zhou He jumped up. Ling Han hadn’t used much power in this attack. Otherwise, he could have smashed Zhou He into pieces with a single palm strike.

Ling Han dashed over and delivered another slap. Pa! Zhou He was sent flying again.

“Insulting a refugee from Huju City, beating you is already a light punishment,” he stated calmly.

Zhou He was about to go crazy. Though Ling Han had controlled his power very well, each slap still caused him pain, and he felt like even his teeth were loose. More importantly, this was the entrance to the Formation Masters Association, and there were so many people coming and going here.

How was he supposed to face others in the future?

“You’re dead!” he said through gritted teeth. If he didn’t kill Ling Han today, his surname wouldn’t be Zhou.

Yan Jun was quick-witted, and had long since gone to call for reinforcements.

Wave after wave of people walked out. There were young Formation Masters who had come to participate, as well as older Formation Masters who had accompanied them here, and there was also Formation Masters from the Imperial Capital. Today would definitely be the liveliest day.

“It’s this brat! Just because he has some abilities, he dares to come to our Formation Association and act wantonly!” Yan Jun pointed at Ling Han and shouted loudly.

Instantly, all the Formation Masters felt like they were united against a common enemy, and revealed furious expressions.

What kind of person would be so bold to actually dare to bully a member of the Formation Masters Association?

To say nothing of Ling Han, even Hong Tianbu wouldn’t dare to do such a

thing!

Ling Han saw that it was about time, smiled faintly, and said, “Everyone, don’t misunderstand. I am also a Formation Master.’

Puff!

Yan Jun immediately spluttered. This guy was also a Formation Master? What kind of joke was that? What did he think a Formation Master was? Did he think he could become one just because he wanted to? So what if your natural talent in martial arts was high? Did that mean that you would also have some accomplishments in formations?

Er, there was indeed such an example, and that was Hong Tianbu, of course. His natural talent in martial arts caused all prodigies to pale in comparison. In fact, he had even reached the standard of High Level in formations. He was overwhelmingly freakish.

However, Ling Han definitely couldn’t be the second Hong Tianbu.

“Just because you say you’re a Formation Master, you are?” Yan Jun shouted loudly.

Ling Han smiled, and said slowly, “So if you say I am not, then I am not? Who do you think you are!” He paused, then continued, “This is a very simple matter. Won’t you find out after investigating?”

That’s right, someone immediately went to do so.

“My name is Ling Han,” Ling Han kindly reminded.

“Even if you’re a Formation Master, that’s going too far!” someone rebuked.

Ling Han shook his head, and said to that person, “What would you do if someone cursed the whole city that you came from to die?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

That person was at a loss for words at first, then immediately said, “l will definitely slap that b@stard.”

In front of so many people, he naturally had to stand up straight. He couldn’t say anything cowardly.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Well said!” He pointed at Zhou He, “This guy had indeed spoken such filthy words!”

He turned on the optical computer and began to play the recording from before.

When everyone heard this, they all shook their heads internally. Zhou He had fallen into his own trap, to actually say such words. No wonder he had been beaten.

At this time, the person who had gone to investigate Ling Han’s origins also returned, and said with a strange expression, “He is indeed Formation Master

Ling.”

Since Ling Han was also a Formation Master, then it was not a conflict between the cultivation world and the formations world. It was only an internal conflict. Furthermore, it was obvious that Ling Han was in the right. Who asked Zhou He to say those words?

“Humph, so what!” Yan Jun came back to his senses from the shock that Ling Han was a Formation Master. He called out loudly, “He’s a Formation Master, so he can disrespect his superior and beat up a Middle Level Formation Master?”

Everyone couldn’t help but nod in agreement. If everyone didn’t abide by the rules, then wouldn’t it be a complete mess if they offended their superiors?

Ling Han shrugged, “It can’t be helped. I am a hot-tempered person.” He looked at Yan Jun, and bared his teeth in a grin, “You have to be careful.”

This was a blatant threat.

Yan Jun couldn’t help but feel stifled. Ling Han was clearly planning to step on him, and it seemed like he really couldn’t do anything about it.

He was a Formation Master, and so was Ling Han. In terms of natural talent in martial arts, Ling Han was a few hundred times superior to him.

If the two of them came into conflict, whose side would the Formation Masters Association side with?

Ling Han walked over, patted his shoulder, and said in a low voice, “Take advantage of this opportunity to take a few more breaths. I can see that in the near future, you will be a dead man.”

Yan Jun’s face instantly turned pale. What Ling Han meant was that he wanted to kill him.

To be honest, he was definitely no match for Ling Han.

In an instant, he made up his mind. From today onwards, as long as Ling Han was still in the Imperial Capital, he would not leave the Formations Association.

Ling Han clapped his hands, and said, “The competition is about to begin, right? Everyone, hurry up and go make your preparations. Don’t you all want to get good results?”

‘True.’

Everyone left one after another. The higher ups of the headquarters would naturally decide how Ling Han would be punished, and there was no need for them to interfere.

Meanwhile, Ling Han operated the optical computer, uploading Zhou He’s previous comments onto the web.

Hehe, didn’t they know that he was the ancestor of screwing others over?

Everyone entered the Formation Masters Association. This was on the left hind paw on the map of the Imperial City, and the Alchemist Association was on the right hind paw. Beyond that was the boundless mountains and plains, so the Formation Masters Association occupied an extremely large area.

They arrived at a place that looked like a training ground. The ground was covered with sand.

There were a lot of people, but none of them made a sound.

This was the sacred land in the hearts of Formation Masters, and now that the tournament was about to take place here, it naturally made people excited, their blood boiling.

Someone had reported the matter of Zhou He, and the higher ups discussed it for a while. They decided that the competition would be held first, and could not be affected by this. As for the punishment of Ling Han, they could slowly discuss it. In any case, there was no rush.

“Begin the tournament.” The Chairperson of the Formation Masters Association was personally hosting the tournament. He was Niu Huaqings Senior Brother, Chen Hao.

The tournament would be conducted through a series of knockout matches. It would be a round of one-on-matches, and the victor would advance, while the loser could only come back next year.

This was a Formations Tournament so naturally, they would be contending with formations, and for a Formation Master, there were actually two main points for the field of formations. The first was to set up formations, and the second was to destroy formations.

Thus, if two Formation Masters competed, it would also be one Formation Master setting up the formation, while the other would try to destroy the formation, and then they would trade places.

Whether they could break through the formation, how long it would take, the difficulty level of the formations they set up, and how long it would take would all affect their results. Thus, there would not be a draw, even if both sides had broken the other’s formations or neither had succeeded.

There were a total of over a hundred Formation Masters participating, and because of the age limit, they were all Elementary Level Formation Masters. If Hong Tianbu came over, that would break records. He was already a High Level Formation Master now.

Though Ling Han had the ability of a Middle Level Formation Master, he had only managed to authenticate as an Elementary Level Formation Master. The main reason why he was willing to participate was because of Niu Huaqing. Otherwise, it was enough for him to have the title of Alchemist. Formations could be used as a trump card, and there was no need to expose it in advance.

Half a day later, it was his turn to compete.

His opponent was a short man who looked to be in his twenties.

“I’m older, so I’ll let you go first,” the man said.

Ling Han didn’t mind. With a casual wave of his hand, seventeen formation foundations immediately fell. With the communication of his spiritual power, the formation was established.

F***, seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded..
