Chapter 1359 Goes to the highest bidder

What was an auction?

That naturally was a universal competition, with the treasure going to the highest bidder.

Zhao Ku, on the other hand, was using his old man’s name to defeat his competitors right from the start. This caused a great many people to involuntarily look angry, wanting nothing more than to drag him out and pummel him. How could he be so overbearing?

Yet Ling Han smiled. With such a profligate young master charging and breaking through the enemy lines, he could expend the least amount of money to obtain the Highest Jade Essence Heart.

In a private room, a person coldly uttered, “Humph, an auction is a competition about who has the most money, not a competition of fathers! 60,000,000!” He increased his bid.

“How dare you, who do you think you are? Do you dare tell me your name?” Zhao Ku shouted in anger. He had already announced his old man’s name, yet the other actually dared not give him any face. This was a serious challenge to him.

To be honest, Young Master Zhao really had no one that he was afraid of in the whole Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire. Even if the actual grandson of the Crimson Flame Emperor came, he would still dare slam a hand on the table in front of him.

“Gu Clan, Gu Shaoyun!” A proud voice rang out from the private room, his arrogant attitude not the slightest bit inferior to Zhao Ku’s.

“Gu?”

“Could it be that it is that Gu Clan?”

“The Great General Gu who had once been equal with Xie Qian and called the Double Tigers of the Majestic Empire with him?”

“Definitely. If that was not the case, how would he have the confidence to compete with the Zhao Clan?”

Everyone gave an ‘oh’, their expressions very excited. If they were destined to be unable to obtain the Highest Jade Essence Heart, they naturally hoped that the bidding price for this object could be as high as possible as only then would they feel better about it.

“70,000,000!” Zhao Ku exclaimed very angrily. The other also had a Eternal River Tier-level background, so he at least needed not be afraid of him, which made Zhao Ku very displeased.

It looked like he could not use his old man to overwhelm the other party, so it could only be a competition of wealth.

“Brother Han, don’t worry. I brought 200,000,000 True Origin Stones with me this time. I will definitely get hold of the Highest Jade Essence Heart for Brother Han!” he declared confidently.

Ling Han smiled slightly. He did not like taking advantage of others, but this kind of spoilt young master was an exception. In the past, he’d dared have designs on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. If it had not been for the fact that he had still been wearing the Silver Dragon Armor, his soul would have long since gone to the underworld.

Since this profligate young master wanted to suck up to him, Ling Han would naturally not stop him. However, if he found out that the Notionless Saint was merely an empty shell in future, would he spit blood in his fury?

That would definitely happen, now that he thought about it. He had acted the lackey and lost his God Tools; this was practically a great humiliation!

However, when that day really came, Ling Han might already advance into the Eternal River Tier, directly tear off this guy’s Silver Dragon Armor, and send him on his way to the afterlife.

“80,000,000!” Gu Shaoyun stated calmly as if he was sitting on a mountain of gold, appearing to be completely unhurried.

“90,000,000!” Zhao Ku was determined to compete with him, and increased his bid without the slightest hesitation.

“100,000,000!”

“110,000,000!”

With these two young masters of noble clans competing, the bidding price of the Highest Jade Essence Heart soared. Others did not even have the chance to place a challenging bid when the price had instantly surpassed their expected baseline.

But when the bid came to about 150,000,000, even Zhao Ku was starting to break out in a cold sweat. He had brought 200,000,000 True Origin Stones, and was already very close to his limit. However, the other party was still calm and unhurried as if the wealth he had in his possession was far from this sum.

This caused him to feel very embarrassed.

This was happening right in front of Young Master Han!

He did not manage to successfully accomplish the first task, so how could he bear with such humiliation?

“200,000,000!” he directly called out his maximum limit, attempting to overwhelm the competitor with his imposing manner.

“Hiss, it’s now 200,000,000!”

“Though the Highest Jade Essence Heart has no lack of buyers, with no one willing to sell, and would incite a massive competition the moment it appeared, 200,000,000 is too much.”

“About 100,000,000 should be its limit.”

“It can’t be helped. With two young masters competing, I wouldn’t be surprised even if the bid came to 300,000,000.”

The spectators downstage all discussed. The majority of them had come for the Highest Jade Essence Heart, but they did not even have the chance to place a bid.

With how fiercely the bid had been increased, even Gu Shaoyun had been intimidated, and actually did not continue with another bid.

“200,000,000 once!

“200,000,000 twice!”

“210,000,000!” Just when Zhao Ku thought he was sure to win, he heard Gu Shaoyun’s voice. He had once again increased the bid.

“F***!” Zhao Ku immediately cursed, but when he saw how the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was frowning, he hurriedly smiled apologetically and said, “Sorry, Sister-in-law. I have a dirty mouth, I’ll deal out my own punishment!” He gave himself a few loud slaps. Of course, it was merely soft touches in an attempt to show his attitude.

Now that it had reached such a high price, it had actually far surpassed the value that the Highest Jade Essence Heart should have, and only these two young masters would compete so vigorously over it. Thus, the others were merely watching the excitement, and no one was interested.

“Young Master Han, I’m sorry. I don’t have enough money,” Zhao Ku said, his face flushed. This was really a great f****** humiliation. To think a noble young master like him would actually experience a time when he was short of money!

But there was nothing to be done for it. Aside from the Silver Dragon Armor, all his other property had been extorted by Ling Han. How could it be that he did not need to use money to buy some back? And in that manner, no matter how much money he had, it was not enough for his expenditures. It was actually already quite difficult for him to save the 200,000,000 he had now.

Ling Han was indifferent, and spoke up, “250,000,000!”

“Hmm?”

Everyone was surprised. There actually appeared a third competitor? Furthermore, this person was obviously in the same private room as Zhao Ku, so which clan did this young master come from? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Right, wasn’t it the Situ Clan that was entertaining Zhao Ku this time round?

Those who were well-informed immediately thought of this, and secretly whispered among themselves. Soon, everyone knew that the person who had placed a consecutive bid now was “Situ Lin”.

“This Situ Lin really is quite courageous. He actually dares compete with the young master of the Gu Clan.”

“More importantly, this bid is already extremely high at present. If it’s still Young Master Gu who wins in the end, Gu Shaoyun will definitely think that Situ Lin had deliberately raised the bid, and it will be inevitable that the former will bear a grudge.”

“But if Situ Lin won the bidding, Gu Shaoyun would definitely be embarrassed.”

“Whatever the result is, the Situ Clan would still undoubtedly offend the Gu Clan.”

“That is far from good!”

If Situ Lin was present, he would definitely be throwing up blood. F***, what did this have to do with him? He was really too innocent!

“260,000,000!” Young Master Gu hesitated for a moment before raising the bid once more.

The present bid had already exceeded his expectations, but as the young master of the Gu Clan, how could he possibly admit defeat?

What he was competing over now was no longer the Highest Jade Essence Heart, but rather his own pride!

“300,000,000.” Ling Han was extremely calm. Not only did he have hold of an astronomical sum of a billion True Origin Stones, he also possessed a great many alchemical pills and God Tools which he could delegate to be auctioned off. The majority of them were Zhao Ku’s property. No matter what, they had to be worth at least 200-300 million.

Hence, he acted rich and overbearing, completely nonchalant.

“Three... 310,000,000!” Gu Shaoyun rubbed off his cold sweat. He already had a feeling that he was about to lose.

True enough, Ling Han’s voice immediately wafted over. “350,000,000.”

This time, Gu Shaoyun hesitated for a long while, and ultimately did not speak any further.

“350,000,000 once!

“350,000,000 twice!

“350,000,000 thrice, deal!”

The auctioneer immediately knocked on the table, and decided the final owner of the Highest Jade Essence Heart.
