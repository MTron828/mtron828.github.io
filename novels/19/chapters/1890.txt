While practicing Spirit Refinement, Ling Han encountered countless problems and obstacles.

Ling Han was a proud person, and he would only seek help from others if he truly couldn‚Äôt resolve a problem by himself. Even without Alchemist Zi Cheng‚Äôs words, he would have still done his absolute best to resolve his own problems.

Three months passed in the outside world, and this corresponded to over 20 years inside the alchemy room. During this time, Ling Han also overcame several flare-ups from the Black Murderous Curses. He had overcome them in an extremely calm and composed state. In fact, this allowed him to discover some slight secrets of the Black Murderous Curse.

Finally, Ling Han left for the first time, heading to the fifth level to seek help from Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

Because Grandmaster Zi Cheng had already notified the others, Ling Han was able to reach the fifth level unobstructed.

‚ÄúHmm? You‚Äôve only come now?‚Äù Grandmaster Zi Cheng asked in great astonishment. He had urged Ling Han to solve his problems by himself, but this was simply to prevent him from relying too much on others.

In his imagination, Ling Han should have come over to seek help from him after a maximum of 10 days. Now, however, three months had already passed!

Perhaps Ling Han hadn‚Äôt been practicing alchemy in the cultivation chambers?

However, upon hearing Ling Han‚Äôs questions, Alchemist Zi Cheng realized that he had been wrong. Ling Han definitely hadn‚Äôt been slacking off. Instead, he had been working hard toward mastering the First Refinement this entire time. Moreover, he had already made significant progress. Otherwise, he couldn‚Äôt have asked these questions.

Not only was Alchemist Zi Cheng experienced, but he was more so a Four-Star Alchemist who had already mastered the Seventh Refinement. Thus, he was fully aware of what Ling Han‚Äôs ability to ask these questions signified.

He was a prodigy!

He was a supreme prodigy!

Of course, some of Ling Han‚Äôs questions were a result of him driving himself into a dead end. However, most of his questions were extremely precise and to the point.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was naturally ecstatic upon hearing Ling Han‚Äôs questions. He gave detailed explanations to each of them, causing Ling Han to continuously nod and exclaim in realization. As it turned out, some of his problems were actually extremely easy to resolve. By looking at them from a different perspective, an answer would immediately appear.

It looked as if Alchemist Zi Cheng could easily answer all of Ling Han‚Äôs questions. However, this was built upon his wealth of experience, which had carried him to the position that he enjoyed today. If these questions had been posed to a Two-Star Alchemist, they definitely couldn‚Äôt have given such clear and thorough answers.

This had to do with knowledge and experience. Alchemist Zi Cheng had nurtured all of his three previous disciples into Four-Star Alchemists. Not only did this prove his ability as an alchemist, but it also proved his ability to teach others.

‚ÄúBrat, you‚Äôve done fairly well,‚Äù Grandmaster Zi Cheng said with a satisfied nod. His eyes were filled with appreciation and adoration as he looked at Ling Han.

Although this young disciple had only just pushed open the door to alchemy, the talent that he had displayed was truly something that even he had to marvel at.

With a good master such as himself, combined with Ling Han‚Äôs talent and hard work, it was truly possible for Ling Han to become a Five-Star Alchemist!

Five-Star Alchemist!

Grandmaster Zi Cheng felt slightly adrift as he daydreamed about this. He was so excited that even his head went numb.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hope that you can master the First Refinement within a year!‚Äù Alchemist Zi Cheng said in a solemn voice.

In fact, he had set this time limit of one year to push Ling Han and give him some pressure. He hadn‚Äôt held any expectations of Ling Han actually mastering the First Refinement within a year. Even with the existence of the Time Cultivation Chambers, mastering the First Refinement within 100 years was still a great feat.

However, he wasn‚Äôt aware that Ling Han also possessed a Reincarnation Tree. This was a paramount treasure that even Celestial Kings couldn‚Äôt possess. It was because of this that Ling Han could hope to master the First Refinement within a year.

The old man‚Äôs hair and beard billowed in the breeze, and it was as if he were enjoying the euphoria of eating valuable ginseng. No, no, no... It was as if he had just earned a few hundred million Star Stones. This was an incredible feeling.

His decision to take Ling Han as a disciple was definitely an extremely correct one. The more he looked at this disciple, the more he liked him. However, it was a shame that he didn‚Äôt have any children. Otherwise, if he had a daughter, he would have wed her to Ling Han no matter what.

‚ÄòSomeone as talented as my disciple should have more children so that I have more disciples to teach!‚Äô the old man thought to himself as he gazed at Ling Han. Such a talented bloodline definitely had to be passed down.

Ling Han couldn‚Äôt help but shudder upon seeing Alchemist Zi Cheng‚Äôs expression. He had a nagging feeling that his master didn‚Äôt have any good thoughts in mind. He hurriedly took his leave. The old man wasn‚Äôt thinking of introducing him to a new wife, was he? However, his expression had already given him away. He looked just like a matchmaker.

Ling Han returned to the fourth level, and continued to practice alchemy.

If he failed in his pill refinement, he could still use Spirit Refinement to transform them into something useful. Of course, this was only a possibility and not a guarantee. If his Spirit Refinement also failed, the Celestial pill would certainly become a trash pill. It would be impossible to transform it into something useful.

Thus, Ling Han‚Äôs wastage during these years was absolutely astonishing.

He continued to successfully refine alchemical pills, yet he also continued to render Celestial Pills absolutely useless after failing to successfully complete Spirit Refinement. Each time he failed, he would enter the Black Tower and ponder the reasons for failure under the Reincarnation Tree. He definitely wouldn‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes twice.

However, there were far too many factors that could affect Spirit Refinement, and this forced him to endure failure after failure. Moreover, each failure represented a great number of Star Stones vanishing into thin air. This was a painful experience for Ling Han.

His Divine Demon Sword! When in the world could it become a Celestial Tool? When could he not worry about Star Stones?

Mm-hm, if he became the leader of Alchemy City, he would most likely have enough wealth at his disposal.

‚ÄòI‚Äôll continue to refine alchemical pills! For the sake of my Divine Demon Sword!‚Äô

One year had already passed in the outside world. However, Ling Han still had yet to succeed. This was the first time that he had failed to live up to someone‚Äôs expectations. However, Ling Han had already forgotten about this. All of his attention and efforts were focused on Spirit Refinement.

If Grandmaster Zi Cheng witnessed Ling Han‚Äôs current situation and technique, he would definitely be given a huge shock. He would definitely shout, ‚ÄúFreak!‚Äù

This was because... Ling Han‚Äôs technique already contained an element of uniqueness. It wasn‚Äôt a direct copy of his master‚Äôs techniques.

Absorbing, digesting, and transforming it into something of his own. This was what Ling Han was currently doing. He wasn‚Äôt simply emulating Alchemist Zi Cheng.

If Ling Han simply ventured down the same path as Grandmaster Zi Cheng, he could have already mastered the First Refinement three months ago. However, he understood that developing a strong foundation was the most important thing. This would decide how high he could climb in the future.

Thus, he would persist down this path even if it took him 10 years or 100 years.

Because Ling Han hadn‚Äôt visited the fifth level in so long, Alchemist Zi Cheng especially came down to visit him. He had come in secret, and others naturally couldn‚Äôt discover him if he didn‚Äôt want them to. After all, he was an Ascending Origin Tier elite.

He stood outside the alchemy room for a long time, and his expression was one of deep astonishment and also appreciation. In the end, he silently left without disturbing Ling Han.

This disciple... was truly incredible!

He had to begin some preparations as Ling Han would definitely master the First Refinement in the near future. At the same time, he had also received Alchemist Chu Ye‚Äôs reply, saying that he would return to Alchemy City within half a year.

When Alchemist Zi Cheng returned to the fifth level, he immediately issued an order. This was an order that brought great commotion to Alchemy City.

Alchemist Zi Cheng had proposed to make Ling Han the 10th Holy Son of Alchemy City!

Holy Son!

Becoming a Holy Son of Alchemy City was a great deal. After all, this was a force that controlled almost the entire flow of alchemical pills into the Eastern Celestial Realm. It could be said that they possessed astonishing power.

Moreover, Ling Han had already shot to fame before, and it was extremely likely that he was the youngest One-Star Alchemist in history. He was brimming with talent, so if he became a Holy Son, he would definitely become the most dazzling Holy Son. The others would become dull and insignificant.

Upon hearing this news, the clans that were focused on cultivation were naturally filled with excitement as they tried to become acquainted with Ling Han. Meanwhile, Lu Xianming and the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters started to hold secret discussions, brainstorming how to ruin Ling Han‚Äôs chance of becoming a Holy Son.

Assigning a new Holy Son wasn‚Äôt up to Alchemist Zi Cheng alone. Instead, Ling Han‚Äôs own talent and abilities were also of utmost importance.

He was indeed a One-Star Alchemist. However, did he understand Spirit Refinement?
