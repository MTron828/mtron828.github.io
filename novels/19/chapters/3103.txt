3104 Fighting a wolf

Ling Han’s strength was advancing by leaps and bounds.

A few more days later, Ling Han encountered a problem.

The nine Spirit Gathering Formations were all broken, and his supply of jade seeds was almost used up.

He was extremely poor again, but he still had six Meridian Guiding Pills.

Looking at the date, it happened to be the 21st today. He disguised himself a little, and went to the black market at night.

A person wearing an ox-head mask appeared, and said enthusiastically, “Brother Han, you are finally here.”

This was Nie Yang. Ling Han recognized him from his voice.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be surprised, and asked, “You actually recognize me?”

He hadn’t said anything yet.

“Only you would set up your stall in such a remote corner.” Nie Yang smiled, and said, “How is it? Are there Meridian Guiding Pills for sale again?”

Ling Han also smiled, and asked, “You’ve broken through?”

“Of course!” Nie Yang was a little proud. He was also one of the few geniuses in the Ancient Dao Sect, but there were too few Meridian Guiding Fruits, limiting his speed of advancement. Now that he had the help of the Meridian Guiding Pill, he could naturally sense his eighth meridian easily.

“You haven’t cultivated to the limit yet, right? Is there such a rush?” Ling Han asked.

“Brother, don’t you know that the wearer knows best where the shoe pinches? This is a Meridian Guiding Pill. Only you would actually sell it, Brother.” Nie Yang sighed.

“You’re really rich.” Ling Han was also a little rueful.

“Hehe.” Nie Yang laughed.

Some jade seeds were exchanged with treasures he had risked his life to obtain, while others were given to him by his grandfather. Who asked him to have an ancestor of Eleven Meridians? The latter was close to standing at the peak of this world.

Ling Han didn’t ask any more questions. What he needed was jade seeds. He didn’t need to know about other people’s matters.

“It’s still 150 jade seeds.” Ling Han took out a bottle and placed it on the ground.

“I’ll buy it.” Nie Yang tossed a bag to Ling Han, and then picked up the bottle on the ground.

“You don’t want to see if it’s real or fake?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“I trust your character,” Nie Yang said boldly.

Ling Han nodded. This person was really worth befriending, but his taste was too unique. Last time, he had worn a goat mask, and this time it was an ox-head mask.

“If you get into any trouble, feel free to look for me,” Nie Yang said. He didn’t ask anyone else to buy another pill on his behalf, because he knew that this wasn’t realistic. No one would give him the Meridian Guiding Pill after knowing about it.

With a price of 150 jade seeds for a Meridian Guiding Pill, it naturally sold very well. In just 10 minutes, Ling Han sold three Meridian Guiding Pills, but he kept the remaining three as he had other uses for them.

Ling Han bought a few more Spirit Gathering Formations, and then left carefully.

After such life continued for a few more days, Ling Han felt bored.

He planned to go out for a stroll. Of course, it would be within the boundaries of Haiping Mountain. There were no Demonic Beasts here, and even if there were, they might have just mutated. They couldn’t be that powerful.

However, just to be safe, he still went to the town and bought a sword. It was also made of Earth Element Iron, so it was sharp and sturdy.

He carried his sword and entered the depths of the mountains.

The heaven and earth had changed drastically, and the landscape had changed. There were ancient sites that emerged from the ground, and there were also tall mountains that emerged from the earth. Even the original tall mountains had changed, and there were now narrow valleys and sharp peaks.

Haiping Mountain had existed since ancient times, and it was not a mountain that had appeared after the drastic changes of heaven and earth. However, there were a few more dangerous peaks on the mountain that were so tall that they jutted into the clouds.

Although the Ancient Dao Sect occupied this mountain, no one could climb these dangerous peaks. It wasn’t that the terrain was too dangerous, but that there was an inexplicable force suppressing them, preventing them from ascending.

That should be due to a formation that had been set up, Ling Han guessed.

He strolled slowly in the mountains, and the air was exceptionally fresh. It was said that before the change in heaven and earth, humans had entered the era of industrialization, causing great damage to nature.

However, after the great mutation, factories turned into ruins, and the environment became better.

It had to be said that this was a great irony.

Ling Han deviated from the normal route, and entered into the primitive parts of nature.

It had only been a little over 100 years, but these plants had undergone an outbreak of growth. Large numbers of trees that were more than 100 meters tall had appeared. They were like small mountains that blotted out the sky.

Ling Han strolled along, feeling comfort like he was a dragon swimming in the sea, or a tiger returning to the depths of the mountains.

After walking for a while, he felt thirsty, and found a small stream to quench his thirst.

Suddenly, he felt a strong sense of foreboding.

Xiu! A strong gust of wind came from behind.

Ling Han clenched his fist, turned around, and threw a punch.

It was a giant black wolf that was about two meters long. Its fur was soft and glowing, and it was originally very handsome, but now it bared its mouth full of fangs and drool flowed out, making it look extremely ferocious. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Peng! This punch avoided the giant wolf’s mouth, but the giant wolf’s head also dodged his fist, and the two simply brushed past each other.

Ling Han was astounded. His punch had actually missed.

The huge wolf had missed its target and landed steadily on the ground. It was really very tall, about 1.2 meters at the shoulder, and its eyes were like light bulbs, staring fixedly at Ling Han.

Ling Han beckoned with his hand, and said, “Come on!”

The giant wolf was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, it began to pace around, as if it was searching for Ling Han’s weakness.

The wolf was a very smart animal. Being a hunter, patience was one of its strengths.

“If you don’t come, I will!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and charged forward.

He didn’t need to use a weapon to deal with a wild wolf that might have just begun to mutate.

The giant wolf was forced to fight. It waved a paw, and swatted at Ling Han’s head.

It was huge, and the force of this swat was no paltry matter. Even if it didn’t have 250 kg of strength, it would still have a strength of 150-200 kg.

Ling Han was naturally unafraid, and exchanged blows with the giant wolf.

The giant wolf immediately let out a wail as its huge body was sent flying.

Ling Han sighed, and withdrew his fist. There was a bloody mark on his fist, which originated from a slice of the giant wolf’s claws.

In terms of power, Ling Han had the upper hand, but in terms of physique, he was inferior to the giant wolf.

If only he could cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

“Again!” He laughed heartily. In the past, he had slaughtered dragons as easily as if he was slaughtering chickens. Now, this was just an ordinary giant wolf. How could it be that he couldn’t handle it?

The giant wolf was in a lot of pain from this punch, but this stimulated it into madness, and it launched a counterattack at Ling Han.

Ling Han fought fiercely with the giant wolf. Relying on his endless battle experience and his advantage in power, he quickly gained an absolute upper hand.

“You can be considered the first sacrifice.” Ling Han used the Four Directional Fists, and the power of each punch was stabilized at around 600 kg. This was too terrifying, and the giant wolf howled in pain from the impact, its spine quickly broken.

“There’s meat for dinner.”

Ling Han began to skin the wild wolf by the stream. After washing it clean, he started a fire and set up a piece of wolf meat to roast over the fire. Very quickly, it was roasted until it was golden, and oil seeped out, emitting an alluring fragrance.

‘What a pity. If only I had a spatial artifact. I could store seasonings in it, and I would be able to add seasonings too. The taste would be even better.’

“Zhi, zhi, zhi!” Just as Ling Han was about to start eating, he saw a large baboon jump out, and it was continuously pointing at that piece of meat.
