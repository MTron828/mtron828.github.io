Chapter 1989: The Madman was defeated

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What, the Madman had been defeated?

Immediately, a commotion erupted in the crowd. A lot of people looked disbelieving, and thought that this was nothing but a mere rumor.

“Hehe, it’s not the first time that the Madman has been defeated.” Someone shook their head. “This Madman dares to challenge even Ascending Origin Tiers, so isn’t it very normal that he would be defeated?”

“Hahahaha!” A great number of people roared with laughter.

To say nothing of a Severing Mundane Tier challenging Ascending Origin Tier elites, even against an Immortal Palace Tier, they would be horribly defeated. Even a fifth severance monarch tier like Ling Han could only suppress Yin Soul elites and match Earth Soul elites at most. There was absolutely no possibility that he could emerge victorious against a Heaven Soul opponent. Still, how could anyone normal want to challenge an Ascending Origin Tier? Only a maniac like the Madman could do something like this.

“No, no, no, the one who defeated the Madman was not Ascending Origin Tier.” The person who had brought the news immediately shook his head.

“Then, it would have to be Immortal Palace Tier,” someone continued.

“No.” The newsbreaker continued to shake his head.

“Heaven Soul?”

“No!”

At this, everyone’s laughter immediately quieted down. If this news was true, that would indeed be very shocking.

“Is it a monarch tier Dividing Soul Tier elite?” Someone ventured a guess.

A considerable number nodded. Though the Madman was the strongest of Severing Mundane Tiers in the Three Capitals Heaven, as long as one had advanced into the Dividing Soul Tier, even a king tier would be able to match him. An emperor tier would even be able to suppress him. After all, this was the superior suppression of a major tier.

“You all have guessed wrongly. The person who defeated the Madman isn’t a Dividing Soul Tier, but a Severing Mundane Tier as well!” That person finally announced a piece of information that was earth-shattering.

“Impossible!”

“It must be just a rumor.”

“And to think I guessed for so long what elite the Madman has gone off to challenge again. As it turned out, it was just rubbish.”

“Completely meaningless!”

At least 99 percent of them all shook their heads, completely unwilling to believe this fact.

The Madman was the strongest Severing Mundane Tier in the Three Capitals Heaven, which was equivalent to being the strongest of the surrounding seven Heavens. To declare that a Severing Mundane Tier had been able to defeat him, how could it be anything but a joke?

Could it be that the strongest Severing Mundane Tier of the Heavens in the above-average ranks, or even higher ranks had deliberately come here to challenge the Madman?

The chances of this were practically zero.

“It’s true!” that person swore. “I swear on my life and wealth that this information is absolutely true without any mistake! The person who defeated the Madman was a mysterious person by the name Ji Wuming. It is said that his battle with the Madman caused ghosts to weep and gods to howl, the heavens collapsed and the earth quaked. The Madman used all techniques that he could, yet was still defeated. In fact, he even almost died. When he fled, only one side of his body was left.”

When they heard him say this, even more people burst out laughing. This was really too hilarious. Even if there really was someone capable of defeating the Madman, how could he have possibly forced him into such dire straits?

However, Ling Han’s heart jolted.

Ji Wuming!

That was no ordinary fifth severance monarch tier, but rather one who had once been a Celestial King, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

His methods definitely could not be judged by normal standards. His strength was powerful enough to drive anyone to hopeless despair, and the majority of monarch tiers could only look up at him in admiration.

If it was said that it was Ji Wuming that had defeated the Madman, then Ling Han would not think it the slightest bit strange.

Ma Tongguang scoffed, and said, “What Ji Wuming, what Madman? They are all frogs at the bottom of a well. In the Western Celestial Realm, which one of them could lay claim to the name of a prodigy?”

Ling Han tossed him a glance, and shook his head, but did not say a word.

Who was he calling a frog at the bottom of a well? He was the true frog here!

“Brother Ling, do you think I have spoken wrongly?” Ma Tongguang suddenly directed his assault on Ling Han.

“Overwhelmingly wrong,” Ling Han said evenly, not giving him any face at all.

Initially, Ling Han had wanted to maintain peaceful relations with the other, but who told this guy to so determinedly take the initiative to trifle with him? He was not a lump of dough that could be squashed at will. Who did he think he was?

“Brother Ling, are you unconvinced?” Ma Tongguang asked menacingly. It was time to let this frog at the bottom of the well know that there were always more talented people in the wider world.

Boom!

The Empress and Hu Niu moved at the same time. Two snow white slender palms struck out, and even the heaven and earth instantly paled in color.

Neither of them were the type to reason. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How dare you!!” Ma Tongguang humphed coldly. These two women actually dared make a move against him? Humph, did they think just because they were beautiful, everyone had to coddle and spoil them?

But he immediately paled in shock because the attacks of the two women were incredibly fierce, and he felt a tremendous amount of pressure.

He hurriedly used his full power. Peng, a frightening shock wave rolled out, and he was instantly sent flying from the blast, quickly turning into a tiny black dot.

The Empress and Hu Niu exchanged a look. This was the first time that they thought the other was actually a little pleasing to the eye.

Meanwhile, Lu Xianming was dumbfounded with shock. He had always believed in the superior strength of the Western Celestial Realm, and Ma Tongguang had cultivated both martial arts and alchemy. Not only was he a prodigy of alchemy, he was also a monarch tier in terms of cultivation. In a battle of equal cultivation level, he should have been absolutely invincible.

But the joined forces of the two women had sent him flying with a single blow.

This, this, this, this, this... How could he accept this?

Ling Han smiled faintly. To Lu Xianming, this was akin to having his whole world collapsing, but to Ling Han, this could not be anything more ordinary.

Ma Tongguang was indeed a monarch tier, but he could only be comparable to Yan Xianlu at most. Whether it was the Empress or Hu Niu, they were both slightly stronger than him, and the joined force of the two women was naturally even more frightening. Perhaps, if it had been Ling Han in his place, he, too, would have been sent flying with a single move.

The difference was that while Ling Han would have been sent flying, he definitely would not have been wounded.

Ling Han didn’t bother to deliver a blow to Lu Xianming, and merely swept an unconcerned eye over him, completely dismissing him from his attention.

But this kind of contempt made Lu Xianming’s whole body tremble. This was due to fury. Just think, he was still a Two-Star Alchemist at the very least, and in the future, it would be a piece of cake for him to become a Three-Star Alchemist, though it would be slightly difficult to become a Four-Star Alchemist. But Ling Han actually couldn’t even bother to give him a second glance, which hurt his pride harshly.

‘Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!’

And the other person that was cursing would be Ma Tongguang. He had only managed to halt his course after crashing into a mountain peak. After pulling himself out of the mountain, he was already so furious that his whole body was shooting flames, but at the same time, he was also filled with wariness.

Though he had indeed underestimated his opponent, and though he had been attacked by the two women together, if it had not been that the two women’s strength was absolutely powerful, how could they have possibly sent him flying with a single move?

The Eastern Celestial Realm actually had such prodigies!

Ling Han... was indeed his great enemy. Not only was this person’s skill in alchemy amazing, he had two powerful helpers by his side. Furthermore, they were world-shakingly beautiful at that, enough to drive anyone to mad jealousy.

However, Ling Han himself should not be all that powerful.

Ma Tongguang was certain of this. Otherwise, it would not have been the two women attacking just now, but rather Ling Han himself.

In the Yang Soul Ocean, he only had to separate Ling Han and the two women, and that would be the time for him to move.

“Shu Yarong is here!” someone suddenly shouted, immediately drawing the eyes of countless others.

Shu Yarong, the number one beauty of the Wide Prosperity Heaven who was also an invincible monarch tier. Wherever she went, she would become the center of attention of the masses.

Amidst a fluttering of white robes, an exquisite beauty arrived by stepping on air. Her black hair floated like clouds, seemingly elegant and untouched by the mortal world. Who else could it be but Shu Yarong?

As her eyes swept over the surroundings, her gaze immediately locked down on Ling Han, showing a menacing killing intent.

Because a Celestial King from the Roc Palace had stepped out on Ling Han’s behalf, the Celestial King Tier-level forces of the Wide Prosperity Heaven had not caused trouble for Ling Han.

It did not mean that they had let Ling Han off the hook, though. Instead, they were going to go by the rules: Severing Mundane Tier versus Severing Mundane Tier, Dividing Soul Tier against Dividing Soul Tier, and would absolutely not bully the weaker party with their superior strength. Of course, this would only happen among Celestial King Tier-level forces that were closer in strength. Otherwise, if the junior of an Ascending Origin Tier-level killed someone, that definitely would mean an absolute massacre by the Celestial King Tier-level force.
