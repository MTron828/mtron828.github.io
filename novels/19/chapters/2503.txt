Chapter 2504: The Duplicate Moon Sect

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Three figures shot forwards from afar. Because the range of visibility here was only around 1 km, when Ling Han saw them, the three of them had actually arrived within his vicinity.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and saw that this trio was made up of two men and a woman. They were all very young, but looked imposing. They were actually all at the Ascending Origin Tier, and all of them were in the consummate level at that.

He saw that they were only several tens of millions of years old, yet all of them had reached the consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, and were only a single step away from the Celestial King Tier— hold on, how were cultivation levels differentiated in this place?

Ling Han could only make deductions based on the strength of the aura they emanated—that they were equivalent to the Ascending Origin Tier in the Celestial Realm. Their natural talent was indeed extraordinary.

The three of them paid no mind to Ling Han, and merely went on to kill that giant green frog. Because the giant green frog was already dazed from colliding with Ling Han, it was soon dealt with when the three of them suppressed it forcefully.

“Haha, now that we have the venom sac of this golden-veined frog, we will be able to cure the illness of Master’s wife.” The three of them stowed the giant green frog away, and all of them were extremely delighted.

Ling Han also smiled slightly. He had finally seen someone, so he knew that he was not just running around aimlessly here. Then, he could just have these three people lead the way, or simply follow them in secret, and he naturally would be able to walk out of this swamp.

“Yi, why is there another person here?”

“Strange, Hidden Radiance Stage?”

“How could even a Hidden Radiance Stage dare to enter here?”

The trio discovered Ling Han, and all of them looked surprised.

After these several days, Ling Han’s grasp of Regulations had already returned once more to the Severing Mundane Tier. Since the other party said that he was at the so-called “Hidden Radiance Stage,” this was probably one of the classes of cultivation levels in this transcendent dimension.

The Hidden Radiance Stage should be the equivalent of the Severing Mundane Tier.

“How did you get in here?” a young man asked Ling Han. He was dressed in a tight body suit of green.

Ling Han had absolutely zero knowledge of this world, and thus chose to keep an extremely low profile, and said, “I don’t know myself. I was just practicing my cultivation technique, when all of a sudden, a black hole swallowed me up. Then, I realized I had ended up here, and no matter what I tried, I could not walk my way out.”

His words mixed truth with lie, and were actually very close to the truth. He only made no mention that he had come from the Celestial Realm via the Dimensional Transfer Seal—even if he did, they might not believe it, unless he exhibited the might of his Body Art.

What was the point?

The three people exchanged looks, and all felt this was inconceivable. But if that hadn’t been the case, what other explanation would there have been that a person in the Hidden Radiance Stage could come into the Cloudy Dream Marsh?

“It is indeed possible that a sudden twist in space occured, and randomly transported someone into any corner of the world,” the other young man in blue attire said. “I have heard Master say that this is because of the great war outside the realm, which has affected the stability of space.”

The man in green and the woman in red both nodded. Since this was what Master said, it had to be the case.

“Let’s bring him along,” the woman in red said.

The man in green nodded. “With his little bit of strength, to say nothing of having to take a good many years just to walk out of the Cloudy Dream Marsh, he would have long since been devoured by the wild beasts here.”

“Continue the lecture after we have brought him out of the swamp.” The man in blue nodded in agreement as well.

The man in green moved, and his power took the form of a giant hand, which took hold of Ling Han. The three of them both soared, dancing through the air as they flew.

Their speed was actually not as fast as Ling Han’s, but Ling Han was not concerned about this little bit of time difference. Expressing his thanks, he began to cultivate.

His grasp of Regulations had to return to the Celestial King Tier as soon as possible. After all, this would limit the growth of his Body Art as well.

Seeing how Ling Han was actually closing his eyes to cultivate, the woman in red and her companions clicked their tongues in amazement as they thought, ‘This brat really has great composure. He can actually keep his cool to cultivate in this kind of situation.’

This trip actually took as long as three months. They finally left the swamp, and a mountain forest appeared ahead of them instead.

The man in green set Ling Han down, and was just about to tell Ling Han to go on his own way when his eyes suddenly widened.

“Senior Brother Luo, what is it?” the woman in red asked.

The man in green pointed at Ling Han, and even his face was twitching. “H-h-h-he…”

“What’s up with him? He suddenly sprouted horns?” the man in blue joked, but when his eyes swept over Ling Han, his eyes bulged in a similar way.

“Fourth level of the Hidden Radiance!” The woman in red also looked over, and instantly exclaimed in shock.

What kind of joke was this? Previously, this guy had just barely advanced into the Hidden Radiance Stage. Why was he now already at the fourth level of the Hidden Radiance Stage?

This progress was so fast; who would ever believe it?

“An extraordinary genius!”

“Incomparably extraordinary genius!”

They all exclaimed, incredibly stunned.

“Strange, why is there no heavenly tribulation?” the man in green murmured. This was illogical. No matter what, there should have been three instances of heavenly tribulation.

The woman in red pondered for a moment. “There are a rare few that can progress at a rate as fast as this. Perhaps, he is a beloved child of the heaven and earth, so there will be no heavenly tribulation imposed on him?”

Was this even possible? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The man in green and the man in blue exchanged looks, but it seemed like only this explanation was more logical.

“What is your name?” the woman in red suddenly asked Ling Han.

“Ling Han.”

“Are you willing to join the Duplicate Moon Sect?” the woman in red asked further.

Ling Han pretended to consider the question. “I know nothing about the Duplicate Moon Sect.”

The man in green immediately understood. He was a supremely excellent young talent. If they could bring him into their sect, he would definitely become a strong pillar of support for the sect. Furthermore, they, as the people who had discovered Ling Han’s talent, would acquire a relationship that would be enough to benefit them for their whole lifetime.

“It’s fine even if you don’t know. Just go and take a look. In any case, you are not able to return to your original location now,” he said.

The man in blue hurriedly nodded. “That’s right. Come and take a look.”

Once they went to the Duplicate Moon Sect, they had the confidence that Ling Han would never want to leave again. That place was the amazing site of a Celestial King.

Ling Han was also of a mind to find out more about this world, so he nodded, and agreed to join the three of them.

The four of them arrived at the closest city. There was a Transfer Formation here which allowed for convenient travel to various locations.

Ling Han took the opportunity to chat idly with the three of them, and feigned ignorance so he could find out more about this world.

The man in green was named Luo Xing, the man in blue robes was Ji Xueming, and the woman in red was Li Juan, and they were all disciples of the Duplicate Moon Sect.

The purpose of them coming out this time was that giant green frog, and the reason was their master’s wife, in other words, the wife of the Sect Master of Duplicate Moon Sect, who had fallen ill, and this illness could only be cured with the use of that giant green frog.

Their master could not free himself, because he had to constantly use his own power to maintain the vital signs of his wife. Otherwise, there was a chance that she could die at any instant.

Thus, they moved on behalf of their master, seeking the means to cure their master’s wife. Though it had taken some time, the end result was still good.

And added with Ling Han, their venture could be considered perfect.

This transcendent dimension was called the Flaming Frost Realm, and the hierarchy of cultivation levels was actually not much different from the Celestial Realm. The only difference was in the different names of various cultivation levels.

And here, Celestial Kings were also called Celestial Kings, while Heavenly Venerates were also Heavenly Venerates. There was not much difference,

However, the three of them knew absolutely nothing about the horrifying big guy, Hysteria. They only knew that there was a battlefield outside their realm, and war never ended there. Even Ascending Origin Tiers like them were not worthy of taking part in this kind of conflict yet.

Ling Han guessed that that was where the war against Hysteria was taking place. Indeed, even Celestial Kings were not qualified to interfere, what more Ascending Origin Tiers.

Even if there was a Transference Portal that could greatly decrease journeying time, they still needed more than half a year to finally arrive at the foot of the Peaceful Sun Mountains.

This was where the Duplicate Moon Sect was located, but the Peaceful Sun Mountains were extremely massive. There was actually still quite a considerable distance until the Duplicate Moon Sect’s actual location.

“Hehe, stop!” 10 people suddenly appeared in front of them, blocking their path.
