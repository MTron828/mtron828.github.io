Chapter 2509: Forging a Spatial Celestial Tool

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. Give him his Divine Metal back?

His?

He involuntarily laughed. He had already wanted to laugh because of the great contrast between this Celestial King’s appearance and title, and after hearing this, he finally couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He immediately spluttered with laughter.

“Oh, is your name written on it?”

The Red Flower Sect’s master humphed, and said, “This is the territory of my Red Flower Sect, so no matter what you obtain here, it all belongs to my sect!”

“You’re going to be unreasonable then?” Ling Han said in a leisurely voice.

“That’s right, I’m going to be unreasonable. What are you going to do about it?” The Red Flower Sect’s master humphed before waving his hand, and saying, “Into formation!”

Hundreds of Ascending Origin Tier elites instantly started moving. A terrifying killing intent started to form.

A smug expression involuntarily spread across the Red Flower Sect’s master’s face. During the past few days, he hadn’t been sitting around and waiting for Ling Han like a fool. Instead, he had made many preparations, with the most powerful one being this killing formation.

In any other situation, which Celestial King would walk head-first into such a formation?

However, whom could Ling Han blame for letting others set a trap for himself? Ling Han had given the other Celestial King the opportunity to casually set up this formation.

It was also because of this that his opponent was filled with confidence.

Killing intent appeared in Ling Han’s eyes. “Oh, you want to kill me now?”

......

“That’s correct!” the sect master of the Red Flower Sect replied in a baleful voice. Celestial Kings were incredibly valuable, regardless of whether they were alive or dead. He had never planned to only obtain that piece of Divine Metal.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Well then, there’s nothing more to say.”

“Indeed, there’s nothing more to say. Go—”

Whoosh!

A burst of sword light swept over, its radiance illuminating the sky.

Before the Red Flower Sect’s master could even finish the sentence “go die,” his head had already been removed from his body by the vicious slash.

Peng!

Celestial King blood gushed into the air, triggering the grief of heaven and earth. Blood rain drizzled down. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han sheathed his sword. With his current power, and with the might of the Divine Demon Sword, would killing a Second Heaven Celestial King be a difficult task?

The other elites from the Red Flower Sect were still maintaining the killing formation. However, in the blink of an eye, their sect master had already been killed. This plunged them into shock and disbelief. They involuntarily stopped what they were doing. At this moment, a cold chill gripped their bodies.

Should they continue to channel the killing formation?

What an absolute joke! Even their sect master had been insta-killed, so what use would this killing formation be? Could it possibly defeat their opponent?

Since they still hadn’t attacked Ling Han yet, which gave them a chance at reprieve, they should seize this opportunity to immediately stop and surrender.

The elites all fell to their knees, not daring to move another inch.

Ling Han swept his gaze over them. However, he didn’t massacre them. He had no time for this.

He turned around and strode away. After arriving in some city, he paid a handsome sum to buy some information, asking about where he could smelt Divine Metal.

After all, how could ordinary flames melt Divine Metal? He had to find a place that possessed raging Origin Flames.

Many people took him for a fool, yet his offer of a handsome sum would naturally attract some knowledgeable people. In the end, he still managed to gather some information.

He set off, spending one year traveling to a volcano that had already stopped erupting long ago. The earth fire here was incredibly terrifying, and it was definitely strong enough to smelt Divine Metal.

“Such powerful Regulations of Flames,” Ling Han said with a nod. No wonder Divine Metal could be smelted here. If one dived into the earth fire, they would be refined into dust even if they were a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Ling Han didn’t waste any time, and he immediately started to refine the Divine Metal.

This was only a crude billet that contained many impurities. Thus, he needed to purify it before he could forge it into a Spatial Celestial Tool. Otherwise, its strength would be affected.

He arrived next to the crater of the volcano. Using his mighty powers, he then extracted the earth fire to smelt the Divine Metal.

This was a slow process. Even though the earth fire was devastatingly powerful, Divine Metal was Divine Metal, after all. How could it be refined so easily?

As Ling Han looked at the scorching earth flames that were dancing with symbols, he suddenly felt an urge to jump in and extract its magnificent power to temper his own body.

However, he quickly suppressed this urge. After all, he wasn’t Divine Metal. The latter was indestructible, so it would only change shape when burned by the raging flames. However, if Ling Han were refined, he would genuinely be killed.

The temperature here was far too high, so even though Ling Han’s physique could endure it, the other women couldn’t. It was useless even if they stayed inside the Spatial God Tool. This was because the Spatial God Tool would directly melt if it neared the flames.

Thus, they all stayed outside. Ling Han spent most of his time refining the Divine Metal, but he would still find some time to spend with the women every few days. After all, this was an unfamiliar place, so it was necessary for him to be more cautious.

He recovered his physique first, after which he activated the Regulations of Time to accelerate time for himself. This allowed him to refine the Divine Metal much quicker than before.

100 years passed, and a smile finally spread across Ling Han’s face.

He had finally succeeded in purifying the Divine Metal. It was slightly smaller than a fist, and he had forged it into the shape of a small box. Meanwhile, he had sealed the Regulations of Space within it, creating a small world.

This small world wasn’t large, and this was because Ling Han was still far from recovering his full grasp over the Regulations of Space. His Severing Mundane Tier power was naturally limited.

However, the wonderful thing about Divine Metal was its malleability. As long as his cultivation level increased, he could naturally continue to expand the space inside the Spatial Celestial Tool.

Ling Han left the volcano, placing all of the women into the Spatial Celestial Tool. He then entered it himself. He still needed to transform this world into one that was habitable.

Right now, it was sparse and empty. Ling Han moved numerous mountains and plains into it, and he also created several rivers and lakes. As things were now, he wouldn’t consider adding a sea yet. After all, this world was still too small.

He didn’t need to specifically plant trees and flowers, either, since the mountains and plains that he had placed inside were already brimming with vegetation. Of course, there were also many animals and insects. Using his magnificent power, Ling Han also created a sun, a moon, and some stars, giving this world a cycle of day and night.

He was extremely satisfied with his own handiwork. Even though the world still wasn’t perfect, it possessed huge potential and boundless possibilities. In the future, he could change it as he pleased. Moreover, this was a precious tool that truly belonged to him. He didn’t need to worry about it betraying him like the Black Tower had.

“It’s time to head to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.”

As Ling Han traveled, he didn’t forget to cultivate in earnest.

After 100 years in the volcano, he had finally reached the Dividing Soul Tier. However, the higher one’s cultivation, the slower one’s progress naturally became. Even though he was a Celestial King, the Regulations in this realm were different and of a higher level. Thus, how could his progress be quick?

‘If I want to return to the Celestial King Tier, that’ll take at least another 10,000 years, right?’

Ling Han realized that even this might still be an optimistic estimate. However, one should naturally remain optimistic.

After traveling for seven years, Ling Han finally arrived near the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

The Flaming Frost Realm was a transcendent dimension, and it was also the most powerful dimension in the entire Genesis World. Its landmass was also humongous, and it was at least 100 times larger than the Celestial Realm. In fact, this was simply an estimation based on the information that Ling Han currently had. In reality, it was potentially even larger than this.

The World’s Paramount Martial Academy was located atop Boundless Mountain. Right now, Ling Han was in a small village at the foot of Boundless Mountain, mulling over how he should enter the academy.

Indeed, he was acquainted with Heavenly Venerate Zhou Heng. However, was this Heavenly Venerate not busy? Could he visit him as he pleased?

Moreover, Ling Han didn’t like disturbing others, either. He was indeed late because of his own matters. Thus, he wanted to resolve this himself.

If the martial academy were still recruiting, he would enter with his own strength.

Even though his cultivation appeared lowly at this moment, just how powerful was his Body Art? It was entirely possible for him to enter the martial academy based on this fact alone.

He sipped wine in a tavern. No matter which dimension it was, this kind of place was always the best for gathering information.

“Brother, let’s share a table.”
