Chapter 1350 Scared Sh*tless

Ling Han turned around to reply with a punch.

Peng!

Divine light exploded into the surroundings as his fist struck the head of the giant black snake and shattered it into pieces.

“You can’t stop me!”

Ling Han continued to slaughter the disciples of the Earth Dragon Sect. This had been his aim for coming here anyway, so he naturally couldn’t give up simply due to the arrival of Zhao Ku.

“Hurry, run!”

“Activate the sect-protecting formation and bring out the ancestral weapon!”

The disciples of the Earth Dragon Sect were all astounded. They hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would actually be so wanton. Zhao Ku had made his intentions clear already, yet he still dared to attack them so recklessly. Just how arrogant was he?

Fortunately, both their sect-protecting formation and ancestral weapon were already charged up and ready to go. It was only because Ling Han had caught them by surprise that they hadn’t activated these so far.

Weng!

The entire marshland lit up as the large sect-protecting formation started to circulate. Meanwhile, a colossal Earth Dragon materialized in the sky as the ancestral weapon was activated. This Earth Dragon had neither eyes nor a nose nor ears, and it looked incredibly repulsive.

Ling Han was completely unfazed.

Peng, peng, peng!

With just three punches, the sect-protecting formation was blasted into pieces. Along with it, the Earth Dragon was also smashed into smithereens.

He was already at the late stage of the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, so how could these Sun Moon Tier formations and weapons withstand his power?

He was unstoppable as he advanced, and the Earth Dragon Sect started to suffer more and more casualties.

This time, Ling Han finally revealed the ruthless side of himself.

He had already given the Earth Dragon Sect a chance. Since they didn’t take it, they naturally had to suffer the consequences.

‘Die!’

Divine light flashed through the air as Ling Han mercilessly threw his fists again and again. He had unleashed a battle prowess that was invincible among his cultivation level, so how could the mere Earth Dragon Sect withstand his rage? They were like defenseless puppets as they were killed one after another.

“Damn it! Damn it!” Zhao Ku continued to pursue Ling Han, yet his speed wasn’t fast enough for him to catch up. His efforts were futile, no matter how hard he tried.

He was seething with rage, and he felt as if he were being toyed around with by Ling Han.

No one had ever dared to toy around with him like this before!

He continued to toss all kinds of God Tools into the air. These had naturally been given to him by his father. However, in his hands, these God Tools could only unleash a destructive power at the early stage of the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier, regardless of how powerful they actually were. This was far from enough to threaten Ling Han’s freakish physique. At most, they could only cause him some minor wounds.

In any case, Ling Han’s grasp of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had already soared to a new height. Thus, he could easily heal these minor wounds in an instant. In fact, this still wasn’t the full limit of his capabilities. After all, he had only unlocked the fifth level of the Black Tower not long ago. When he fully comprehended the true essence of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll “defense”, his physique and defense would undergo another transformation and elevate to a new height.

Zhao Ku had a powerful armor and defensive barrier, so Ling Han wasn’t able to wound him. Similarly, Zhao Ku couldn’t wound Ling Han no matter how many God Tools he had. All he could do was pursue him in vain.

His expression would become a shade darker each time Ling Han killed a disciple of the Earth Dragon Sect. This wasn’t out of compassion, but rather out of shame and humiliation.

His opponent was blatantly humiliating him!

“You’re dead meat!” Zhao Ku came to a difficult decision in his mind, and he retrieved a decree from his storage ring.

This decree had been created by his father, who had used the fusion of his martial intent and blood essence to write it. Upon being unfurled, this decree would unleash the power of an Eternal River Tier elite. This power was formidable enough to kill Ling Han 100 times over!

However, creating such a decree was extremely taxing, even for Eternal River Tier elites. Thus, even someone like Zhao Ku only had a single such decree on him.

Right now, all he wanted to do was kill Ling Han!

Weng!

A brilliant light instantly exploded into the surroundings as the decree was unfurled. The martial intent of an Eternal River Tier elite fluctuated through the air, forming a devastating power that was capable of suppressing all beings.

“Go!” Ling Han flicked his hands and tossed the Notionless Saint out.

“Brat, I was trying to cultivate...” The Notionless Saint had been cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree when he was suddenly tossed out. Thus, he was naturally extremely annoyed. However, he couldn’t help but laugh upon seeing the decree in Zhao Ku’s hand.

“Die!” Zhao Ku roared. The decree lit up again as a person walked out from within it. This person was like a god, and he possessed a domineering aura that made him seem like the ruler of the world.

This was a projection that had been formed by the martial intent of Zhao Zuyi. Although its battle prowess couldn’t compare to the real Zhao Zuyi’s, it still possessed at least one-ten-thousandth of his power. In any case, this was still power at the Eternal River Tier, and thus it was still capable of obliterating any Heavenly Body Tier elite.

The projection swatted its palm at Ling Han and the Notionless Saint.

“Humph!” The Notionless Saint humphed coldly, and his Genesis Tier aura instantly surged into the surroundings, suppressing the aura of Zhao Zuyi’s projection.

“A mere Eternal River Tier cultivator like you dares to stand up against me?!” The Notionless Saint made a grabbing motion at the projection.

Pa!

Zhao Zuyi’s projection was instantly destroyed, unable to put up even a shred of resistance!

‘F*ck!’

Zhao Ku’s eyes widened in shock. His face was a picture of disbelief.

This decree had been his biggest trump card, and it was something that could have killed any Heavenly Body Tier elite! Theoretically speaking, there were only a dozen or so Eternal River Tier elites in the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire. In other words, he was the most powerful person apart from these one dozen or so elites. Thus, he could kill anyone that he wanted to kill.

He had merely come to the Earth Dragon Sect to mess around out of boredom, yet he had actually come across such a terrifying being!

This person had obliterated the decree created by his father with a casual grab of his hand. Just how powerful was he?

Zhao Ku started to tremble in fright.

Who told him to unleash a decree? The Notionless Saint had lost his Genesis Tier power long ago, yet he hadn’t lost his grasp of the Regulations. Coincidentally, decrees didn’t contain power, but rather the martial intent of the creator. This was also a form and comprehension of the Regulations of heaven and earth.

Zhao Ku had tried to use the martial intent of an Eternal River Tier elite to attack a Genesis Tier Saint—wasn’t this seeking death?

If Zhao Ku charged over right now and launched a punch at the Notionless Saint, the weakness of this Saint would instantly be revealed. However, Zhao Ku was already going weak at the knees, so how would he dare to attack?

He was at the Heavenly Body Tier, so he could naturally sense the majestic aura that was radiating from the Notionless Saint. This aura was far richer and far more profound than his father’s aura.

This was an ultimate elite!

Zhao Ku knew that he had picked a fight with the wrong person. This was someone who was even more powerful than his father!

How the f*ck could he have predicted this? A tiny force like the Earth Dragon Sect had actually offended someone with such a terrifying background!

Zhao Ku felt that he had been screwed over by the Earth Dragon Sect. His name was indeed a reflection of his current situation—f*cking miserable!

Ling Han noticed the shift in Zhao Ku’s expression, and he said, “Zhao Ku, I’m not a bloodthirsty person, either. How about this. Leave your warship, chariots, God Tools, and whatnot behind, and I’ll spare your life.”

This was called getting things for free.

Zhao Ku was overjoyed. He could still get out of this alive?

“I’ll give them to you! I’ll give them all to you!” he hurriedly said. This warship was his father’s, and he had spent a lot of time and effort to construct it. The chariots were also incredibly valuable. However, what did this matter? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Were these as important as his life?

However, Zhao Ku still glanced over at the Notionless Saint. This was the true ultimate elite, and Ling Han’s offer would only count if he also agreed.

The Notionless Saint wore a profound expression, and he calmly said, “Is there a need to ask me about such trivial matters?”

What good acting!

Zhao Ku hurriedly tossed all of his God Tools onto the ground. However, he still wasn’t willing to take off his Silver Dragon Armor. This was his final life-saving God Tool.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before deciding against pushing Zhao Ku too far. Otherwise, if he believed that he would die and counterattacked in despair... The Notionless Saint was merely all talk and no substance!

“You can leave now,” Ling Han said with a wave of his hand.
