3153 Cultivating Spiritual Power

“Young Master is so pitiful!” Huan Xue supported her chin with both hands and looked at Ling Han in a daze.

“Sigh, who would’ve thought that Brother Ling is such a capricious person, to actually go so crazy for love. Please allow me to sing a song in his honour,” a tall, thin man said. He was one of the ten captains, Fu Xiang.

“Oh, my love—” He began to sing, which also caused those around him to cover their ears.

This guy was clearly tone-deaf, yet still had a good opinion of himself. He kept thinking that everyone would not appreciate him, and when he had the chance, he would use his singing voice to brainwash them, so that others would accept the “fact” that he was the God of Songs.

“What are all of you doing here?” Lian Xuerong walked onto the deck, a hint of displeasure on her pretty face. This was too outrageous. They were all warriors after all.

Everyone hurriedly dispersed, and even the God of Song fled in disarray. Ling Xuerong was even referred to as a cold-faced witch by them in private, so who wasn’t afraid?

“Set off, and return to the Empire,” Lian Xuerong said coldly.

She glanced at Ling Han, and when she saw that he was still hugging that disc, she couldn’t help but shake her head. This guy was really too obsessed, wasn’t he?

Forget it. When he returned to Huju City, she would give him a good training, then for sure he would not have the time to daydream.

The warship shuddered, and had already taken flight.

Although the warship was very big, and could accommodate a great many people, Lian Xuerong didn’t bring many back with her. Only the younger generation of various sects and factions. Poeple such as He Guan and the older generation, were left behind in their original forces.

——She was not interested in them at all.

A Ten Meridians in his seventies was really too old. Even if he had cultivated to Twelve Meridians, so what? Could he still fight?

Mystical power would indeed become denser and denser as one’s cultivation level deepened, but physical power was the complete opposite. After seventy, it would decline, and after a hundred, a serious deficiency would appear in physical power.

Unless one was like Sun Jianfang, who could actually rely on his own trial and error to step into the Blood Transformation Tier. That was a true prodigy.

He Guan and the others were naturally displeased, but what could they do? Could it be that they could force Lian Xuerong?

That would really be courting death.’

The warship headed north. The Dark North Nation was located in the extreme north of the Celestial Sea Planet. However, Huju City was located in the southernmost part of the Dark North Nation, and it had only been established for twenty plus years. With the warship’s speed, the jouney would only take about half a month.

In truth, the warship’s speed was not very fast, but its advantage was that it could ignore all obstacles, and travel non-stop day and night.

Ling Han was still the same as before. Every day, he would hold on to the disc, and it was as if eating and sleeping had become his instinct. When it was time, he would eat something, and then lay down to sleep, not caring about anything else.

“Sigh, how deeply in love!” Wang Feng sighed ruefully.

“I want to sing a song again,” Fu Xiang said.

When they heard this, everyone hurriedly ran away.

“Young Master, Young Master!” Huan Xue was so anxious that she was almost tearing up.

The heaven and earth had changed, and large amounts of wild beasts had evolved into Demonic Beasts. Not only were there Demonic Beasts on the ground, but there were also Demonic Beasts in the skies. There were also behemoths with wings that reached dozens of meters in length, or even over a hundred meters in length.

On their way, they encountered a few. Thankfully, with the light cannons on board, these Demonic Beasts did not dare to provoke them.

Sixteen days later, a large black city appeared on the ground ahead of them.

There were no tall city walls, and this city was open on all sides, with no boundaries!

Hiss, how domineering.

“We’re home.” Wang Feng and the others all smiled. Their parents, wives, and children were all here.

The warship landed somewhere in the city. Boom! The ship shuddered violently.

Ling Han suddenly came to his senses. Yi!

He discovered that the white dot had moved. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Was it an illusion? Or a misplaced vision caused by a shock?

Ling Han picked up the disc again, and stared at the white dot. He thought to himself, “Move upwards.”

What surprised him was that this white dot had really moved upwards a little.

Success, he had managed to cultivate Spiritual Power.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he breathed a long sigh of relief inwardly. He felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders.

Without proof, no matter how confident he was, he still felt a little uneasy. Right until this moment, when it was proven that he had really cultivated Spiritual Power, he naturally became relieved.

A strong feeling of weariness assaulted him. Peng, Ling Han fell asleep facing the sky.

On the way here, he had only slept for three hours a day, and under such accumulation of weariness, he was naturally extremely sleepy.

When Ling Han woke up, he discovered that he was already lying on the bed, and this was no longer the warship, but rather a decent bedroom.

That’s right, he had cultivated Spiritual Power.

Ling Han immediately got up and channeled his spiritual power. In this place, it was also called Spiritual Power.

Yi!

The moment this Spiritual Power was being channeled, he realized that it was as if he had an additional pair of eyes, and could actually see what was behind him.

No, in all directions, and there was no dead end.

This was the effect of Spiritual Power; it was really too practical.

Would anyone still be able to sneak attack him in the future?

However, this required him to actively channel Spiritual Power, and spiritual power was the same as the mystical power in his body. There would come a time when it would be exhausted.

If he continued to cultivate and strengthen his Spiritual Power, he would naturally be able to channel it for a longer period of time.

Naturally, Ling Han used Spiritual Power to observe himself.

He wanted to “see” his meridians.

When Spiritual Power was shifted onto himself, boom, it was as if he had entered into a new world.

This was a dimension that had been nurtured from the countless cells in his body. He was like an immortal, and could see all the mountains and rivers on every dimension, every blade of grass and every tree, man and beast.

The empress, Hu Niu, his parents, son, and daughter!

A gratified expression appeared on Ling Han’s face. He had finally seen his family again. Though they had only been apart for a few months this time, which was far from the time that he had gone into seclusion before, he was still filled with excitement.

The flow of time in the two worlds was different. One year here was equivalent to 1000 epochs in the Genesis World.

However, with a sweep of his Spiritual Power, Ling Han felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders.

Only 100 or so days had passed in the dimensions inside his body.

Was this because he had been born from the Divine Stone and fused with the world here, so the dimensions in his body had also synchronized in time?

That ought to be the case.

Ling Han wanted to communicate with the empress and the others, but discovered that he could only “see”, as if he was a soul that had no physical body.

Though his Spiritual Power had swept over them repeatedly, the empress and the others did not react at all.

It looked like this was because his Spiritual power was too weak.

This was equivalent to giving him a calming pill. As long as his Spiritual power became slightly stronger, he would be able to communicate with the empress and the others, and if he was even stronger, he might be able to release them.

Good!

This was really very good.

“Young Master, you’re awake?” The little female attendant appeared, her face filled with pleasant surprise.

Ling Han got up, and seeing that he was very hungry, he asked, “Is there anything to eat?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Huan Xue hurriedly nodded. “Young Master, you slept for three days and three nights. You scared Huan Xue to death!” She patted her chest with all her might, as if she wasn’t afraid of her chest being flattened at all.

He had slept for so long?

It looked like he had overdrawn his body greatly.

Ling Han got off the bed. The living room was right outside the bedroom. It was very small area.

Huan Xue brought over dishes and rice, and Ling Han began to eat.

After filling his stomach, Ling Han asked, “Where’s my disc?”

“Ah, I don’t know,” Huan Xue said, her gaze flickering.

“En?” Ling Han’s expression became serious.

“Young Master!” Huan Xue was instantly scared pale, and she said, “Just forget about the Banner Lord Lian! Big Brother Wang and the others already said that Banner Lord Lian definitely won’t fall in love with anyone. You’re just digging your own grave and hurting yourself.”

What was going on here?
