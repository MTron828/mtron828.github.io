Chapter 2001: Canyon at the ocean bed

In such deep waters, Ling Han had no worry about the possibility that Ji Wuming could find him.

Ji Wuming’s battle prowess was indeed strong, but in terms of pure defense, Ling Han could guarantee that he was definitely the strongest of this cultivation level. Even Ji Wuming could only admit his inferiority—even if he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in his last life.

However, this was very, very, very boring.

Ling Han was the only one here, and not only was the scenery eternally unchanging, there was not the slightest bit of sound, making this seem like a living hell.

Fortunately, Ling Han could still enter into the Black Tower, where the four women could provide him some company inside.

Another 300 years had passed, and the number of indigo grade Yang Soul Stones that Ling Han had gathered had increased. The number was more or less 200, but he did not have a single purple grade Yang Soul Stone.

He was a little anxious by now. Half the time had already passed, but he could only eke out a fused purple grade Yang Soul Stone. To say nothing of all of them having a natural purple grade Yang Soul Stone, even for fused ones, he could just barely manage one.

But what could he do about it?

Ling Han remained patient, and swam at the ocean bed in search of the carcasses of marine creatures.

Year passed after year. Time flew very quickly, and seven colors had become two colors. The majority of light bands had become white, lighting up the whole ocean.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han suddenly discovered that the ocean waters were gushing forwards.

The surface of the ocean was not calm and undisturbed, but after venturing so deep into the ocean, everything had become incredibly peaceful, yet now a gushing water flow had suddenly appeared. That could only mean one thing.

Either there was a massive marine creature that was charging over in assault, or a very great change had happened in this ocean.

The current situation was... the latter. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A canyon had actually appeared in front of Ling Han. It was not very big, and its length was around 10 miles. Its entrance was very tiny, and then enlarged. The widest part was also about 10 miles wide, forming a triangular shape.

The reason why there would be gushing water was because the ocean water was presently surging inwards this canyon, and that was why there was a pulling motion.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be curious. He moved with the flow, and floated towards that canyon.

When he arrived at the entrance of the canyon, he shockingly discovered that an invisible wall had appeared ahead of him, stopping him from moving forwards further, and aside from him, the ocean waters had been similarly blocked.

Which meant that the inside of the canyon was actually dry.

This was extremely strange. Since the ocean waters could not enter into the canyon, how had this hidden flow of water formed?

Ling Han rubbed his chin in thought for a while before decisively giving up this line of thought.

There were too many inconceivable things in this world. To investigate each and every one of them was a completely impractical matter. Thus, there was no need for him to confuse himself over the reason for the formation of this canyon, but rather he should ponder how he was going to enter inside.

...At the bottom of the great ocean, a canyon that did not have ocean water had actually appeared. If it was claimed that there was nothing strange about this, who would believe it?

Ling Han shot out a punch. Peng, the invisible wall in front of him immediately rippled, as if it was made out of liquid. It rose and fell continuously, and only after a long while did the undulations finally stop.

It had not broken.

Ling Han was shocked, and shot out another punch. This time, he had used the Regulation of Slaughter, and the destructive power immediately spiked.

Peng, the fist landed on the wall of water, causing a period of ripples, but the wall of water still did not break.

Could it be that it could not be broken through?

Ling Han was not willing to admit defeat. Using celestial techniques, he began a mad barrage of attacks.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

He used all the celestial techniques he could use, but this invisible wall was indescribably tough. No matter how strong the force it sustained, it would not break. At most, it would only shake a few more times.

Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword. Since bare hands could do nothing, he would just use a Celestial Tool.

Heaven Destroying Nine Swords was channeled, and shua, a strike was delivered on the wall of water. This time, the wall of water did not even ripple.

Yet Ling Han looked elated.

Water was most gentle, and even the strongest brute force was incapable of truly causing damage to it. That was because water could distribute the power it sustained over its entirety. Just now, the few punches that he had delivered were like that. They were clearly targeted at a single point, but ultimately, the force was absorbed by the entire Yang Soul Ocean.

In this manner, no matter how strong Ling Han’s strength was, he could not possibly destroy the Yang Soul Ocean, right?

But now, he had drawn the Divine Demon Sword, yet it was still undisturbed. It was not because the force had weakened, but rather all this force had truly landed on a single point, and the power had not seeped out to be shared by the entire Yang Soul Ocean.

This point was the tip of the Divine Demon Sword’s blade.

Ling Han roared, his hands pushing forwards strongly. Ka, kaka, kakakaka, multiple cracks appeared on the invisible wall, more and more, longer and longer, and then it finally shattered with a crash.

Boom, ocean waters surged in, and Ling Han was also brought inside by the ocean waters.

He immediately stood firm, and saw that the water beneath his feet was spreading out in front of him, but it was getting slower and slower. He turned his head and saw that the ocean waters that had surged in were becoming less and less because the hole that had been created was presently shrinking in size.

...This wall had self-recovery ability.

Only in a short while, the invisible wall had completely recovered, and it was no longer visible to the naked eye. He only knew that this “wall” still existed because the ocean waters had been stopped, forming a block.

“Interesting,” Ling Han murmured, feeling his whole body had become light. Because there was no ocean water here, there naturally would not have any water pressure, either.

With a shake of his hand, the Empress, Hu Niu, Bewitching Maiden Rou, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were released instantly.

“Yi, what is this place?” Hu Niu’s big eyes blinked as she curiously surveyed the surroundings.

“Yang Soul Ocean?” The Empress was also surprised, looking towards Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “This is still the ocean bed of the Yang Soul Ocean, but the environment here is more unique. There is a natural barrier that cuts off the ocean waters from this place.”

“So interesting!” Hu Niu clapped her hands and laughed, looking like she had an urge to rush over and play around.

Ling Han hurriedly pulled her back. This little girl was fond of food and liked to play, so it was definitely not just an idea for her.

“This place... what is it?” Bewitching Maiden Rou looked around.

“Let’s search around.”

The five of them split up a bit, and began searching around in the canyon.

This canyon was very small. It would not take too much time for even a normal human to take a tour, what more for elites like them.

“Yi, there seems to be something here.” Hu Niu stopped, and pawed at the ground.

Ling Han walked over, and saw that a sharp spike had actually appeared from the ground. Upon first glance, it looked like a protruding stone pillar, though it was extremely sharp. But as Hu Niu parted the pebbles and dirt around it, he discovered that this stone pillar was becoming longer and longer.

Hu Niu dug deeper and deeper, and this stone pillar became three meters tall from its original height of an inch. FInally, a massive skull actually appeared!

This was the carcass of a gigantic living creature, buried in the dirt at the bottom of the canyon. Only the horn on its head was slightly exposed, which Hu Niu coincidentally happened to spot.

When this massive creature was completely excavated, Ling Han and his group could only look up at it.

It was extremely colossal.

“Indigo grade Yang Soul Stone!” Hu Niu immediately clapped her hands, and extracted the Yang Soul Stone that was inside the skull of the massive creature.

“How could there possibly be the carcass of a marine creature here?” Ling Han rubbed his chin in thought, and thinking about that previous gushing flow of water, he could not help but come up with a deduction. “Could it be that after the surrounding marine creatures died, the carcasses would all be delivered by the flow of water to this place?”

“That wall... perhaps does not block dead matter.”

“Hiss, going by that theory, just how many Yang Soul Stones would there be in this canyon then?”
