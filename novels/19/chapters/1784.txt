Chapter 1785: Nine Revolutions Charm Physique

Ling Han was puzzled. Why did the Empress suddenly create trouble?

She was indeed overbearing in her ways, but would never create trouble willfully.

However, this was the battleship of the Purity Sect, and who knew how many elites occupied this ship. If they kidnapped her forcefully, wasn’t that merely courting death? Moreover, this Holy Daughter might be an elite of the fourth severance, so who would be capturing whom?

“Forget it, Wife.” Ling Han pulled on the Empress’s hand.

Only then did the Empress fall silent, looking like she was not going to lower herself to her level.

Bewitching Maiden Rou almost exploded with fury. She was actually being looked down on!

If this was another person, she would not be concerned at all, but the Empress’s aura was too overbearing, and it also seemed like her beauty could surpass the ancients and dazzle contemporaries, causing her to think of the Empress as a fierce rival. This kind of disdain gave her enormous pressure.

“See them away!” She waved a hand dismissively, panting with rage.

Ling Han and the Empress exited, and Fu Gaoyun was waiting at the doors. When he saw the two of them come out, he hurriedly asked, “How is it?”

“Not bad,” Ling Han answered casually, making entirely no mention of the matter that had happened just now.

Fu Gaoyun immediately sighed in relief, and wished to enter and bid Bewitching Maiden Rou farewell, yet the woman in white blocked his way, and coldly said, “Our Holy Daughter is about to rest. Young Master Fu, please leave.”

Fu Gaoyun was immediately crestfallen, but it would not be proper for him to use force, either. Thus, he could only leave gloomily with Ling Han and the Empress.

But the fact that Fu Gaoyun had managed to repeatedly board the ship was seen by others, and all of them took special notice of Fu Gaoyun. Could it be that Bewitching Maiden Rou was viewing him in a new light? Otherwise, why would she treat him so favorably?

When they returned to their own battleship, Ling Han and the Empress entered into their room. He immediately asked, “Is there something wrong with that bewitching maiden?”

The Empress smiled beautifully, and replied, “Husband, you must obtain her!”

Ling Han sweated like mad. His wife was actually using such a determined expression and tone to tell him to pursue another woman. No matter how he thought about it, it was very weird. He already had enough love debts on his plate, and he really had no wish to have more.

“Why?” he asked. Though the Empress had previously expressed the intention to take Lin Yurou into his harem, that was only mere teasing. However, looking at the Empress’s current expresion, she was being serious.

“She has the Nine Revolutions Charm Physique!” The Empress’s expression was serious. Then, she added, “A Divine Fetus!”

Divine Fetus!

Only then was Ling Han stunned, and showed a hint of shock in his expression. Even in the Celestial Realm, Divine Fetus was not something common, but rather pitifully rare. It was said that Fu Xiaoyun herself was a Divine Fetus, but Ling Han had not discovered any special trait in her no matter how hard he tried.

And now the Empress actually said that Bewitching Maiden Rou was a Divine Fetus!

“Trust me!” the Empress said with absolute certainty. “This is something that the memories in my bloodline have told me, and the Nine Revolutions Charm Physique is an extremely rare type of inheritance that could only be born from an Eight Revolutions Charm Physique.”

The Empress should be a descendant of some Celestial King. After obtaining a slightly more complete Nine Deaths Heaven Art, her bloodline inheritance had been awoken, and she had gained some other memories that did not belong to her.

This was knowledge, knowledge about some supreme cultivation techniques, supreme inheritance, and supremely dangerous locations of the Celestial Realm.

The Nine Revolutions Charm Physique belonged to a very special category among Divine Fetuses because only an Eight Revolutions Charm Physique could give birth to the former, and that was only a possibility. It was also possible that the offspring born would not inherit the “Charm Physique”, and then she would only be limited to Eight Revolutions.

Above Eight Revolutions was Seven Revolutions, and above Seven Revolutions was Six Revolutions.

Just think, not only would the time expended through these many generations be incredibly long, no mistake could be allowed, either. Otherwise, wherever there was a lapse in the inheritance of the Charm Physique, there would naturally be no possibility of the birth of a Nine Revolutions Charm Physique.

For example, Gu Daoyi had used 10 lives to form a supreme Divine Fetus, and the difficulty of forming a Nine Revolutions Charm Physique actually surpassed that.

WIth such thought, Ling Han immediately felt that Bewitching Maiden Rou was very amazing. It was no wonder that her charm techniques were so strong. She was a Nine Revolutions Charm Physique, a Divine Fetus!

“But even if she is a Divine Fetus...” Ling Han scratched his head. There was still no need to capture her to become his wife.

“Dual cultivation with a Nine Revolutions Charm Physique would create a resonance with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, and in the future, it may be possible to even birth a natural manifestation of Heavenly Dao, a child that can naturally merge with great dao!” the Empress said[1].

So amazing?

Ling Han thought for a moment, yet still shook his head, and smilingly said, “So what? I believe in my own strength, and I do not need something like dual cultivation!” He embraced the Empress, kissing her tender and beautiful rose-like lips.

The Empress was elated, and her arms wrapped around Ling Han’s head and neck as she kissed him back earnestly.

“Come, let’s dual cultivate.” Ling Han lifted the Empress into his arms, and entered into the Black Tower. All of a sudden, he very much desired her.

After a bout of clinging to each other, Ling Han taught the Flame Control Technique to the Empress. Though he was unable to copy those unique symbols of great dao, the Empress had seen them with her own eyes previously, so it was no problem.

The two of them discussed this secret technique underneath the Reincarnation Tree, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was unable to cut into their conversation. She could only lean against Ling Han’s side, slightly resentful. At present, she was unable to help Ling Han in the slightest.

Ling Han and the Empress were both people of astonishing natural talent, and they very quickly developed a considerable grasp over this secret technique. However, no matter how strong the Celestial King technique was, it would still be limited by their cultivation level, and could not possibly help them, cultivators only at the second severance, show the battle prowess of the Dividing Soul Tier.

They exited the Black Tower, and began to use it practically.

...If they were in the Black Tower, the Regulations unique to the Black Tower existed, and all cultivation techniques were based on the Regulations of the Great Dao of the outside world, so it was completely inappropriate to use them inside the Black Tower. Thus, no matter how strong a person was, once they entered into the Black Tower, they could only be rendered helpless. Because the Regulations were different, even if you were a Celestial King, you would be turned into a rookie the moment you entered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, the issue of drawing a Celestial King into the Black Tower was a big problem. Furthermore, Celestial Kings were a world of their own, so that would be a clash between two worlds and two types of Regulations, so who knew, it might be the Black Tower that would explode first.

The Empress channeled the Flame Control Technique, and a ball of fire immediately burst into life in her hand. This was the Element of Fire of heaven and earth that had been created by the Celestial King technique.

“So strong!” the Empress remarked with a nod. “This is definitely a top-grade cultivation technique!”

Ling Han nodded. Even he could sense how frightening this ball of fire was. It was completely capable of refining his powerful physique forcefully. Of course, the time it would take was not just two to three days, but rather would be counted in years at least.

His right hand also shook. Boom, a flame similarly formed.

It was not created by condensing the Fire Element of the heaven and earth, but rather came from within his body.

Nine Heavens Flame!

WIth a thought from him, the Nine Heavens Flame turned into a sword of fire. It was incredibly realistic, and there were multiple symbols of great dao on the sword’s blade. Upon a closer look, they were actually exactly like those from the Flame Control Technique.

That Celestial King should have drawn out the symbols of great dao from within the Nine Heavens Flame, and inscribed them into the cultivation technique.

He was really amazing, being able to extract even such symbols of great dao.

Ling Han waved the fiery sword lightly, and no matter what it struck, it would immediately be cut. Under the control of a Celestial King technique, he could further incite more might from the Nine Heavens Flame.

“At present, I have the confidence to battle a peak stage at the fourth severance!” He laughed loudly, filled with confidence.

Of course, he currently would only be able to match a normal peak stage of the fourth severance. If it was a flawless severance, he probably would still be slightly inferior, and if it was an opponent that had struck the heaven and earth, then putting aside the fourth severance, he could only barely cope even with a third severance, and that would have to depend on whether the opponent was in the early stage, middle stage, late stage, or the peak stage.

However, if he really inflicted a direct strike with the Nine Heavens Flame, then to say nothing of the peak stage of the fourth severance, even Dividing Soul Tiers would be killed.

At this time, a sudden clamor rose up from outside.
