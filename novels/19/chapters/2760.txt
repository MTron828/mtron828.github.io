Ling Han aimed precisely for this.

Who would dare to bully the descendants of the Lin Clan in the martial academy? Or the descendants of the Wu Clan?

None, because both Lin Luo and Wu Zhihong have established a reputation of being invincible. Everyone knew that the two of them had already leaped out of the limits of rules. If they wanted to kill, they could, and no one could stop them.

Thus, there would be no one that would dare trifle with their family and friends, either, because they would only push themselves onto the path of no return.

!!

Ling Han also wished to establish such a ferocious reputation, guaranteeing the absolute safety of his family and friends. Otherwise, how was he supposed to clash with his full power against Hysteria in the Realm Battlefield?

“Brother Ling!” The Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate appeared once more. His expression was very complicated. “Please carefully consider before you do anything.”

“I have already considered very carefully.” Ling Han threw a punch. Pa! Yu Wudi’s head was instantly shattered to bits.

Clang! The heaven and earth cried in grief, unleashing a haze of blood rain.

Ling Han’s eyes sharpened, and he exclaimed to the heavens, “This kind of evil villain died, and is actually worthy of the grief of the heaven and earth? Go back!”

He unleashed his might. Boom! The haze of blood rain instantly reversed its flow, and as Ling Han’s might surged, it resounded in all of their hearts, forcefully suppressing the grief and sorrow that the heaven and earth had stimulated.

This was practically heaven-defying!

Everyone hissed sharply. Though cultivating itself was an act that defied the heavens—otherwise, one would not be blasted by a heavenly tribulation every time they had a breakthrough—in truth, cultivators were also attached to the heavenly tribulation, just like how Celestial Kings represented Regulations.

Even a Heavenly Venerate would need to draw on the fundamental power of the Genesis World to be able to unleash their full might. The difference was that a Heavenly Venerate had transcended, so even if they were in other dimensions, they would still possess great power. Similarly, they would have to extract the fundamental power of the Genesis World, which was not limited to a specific dimension.

Hence, even a Heavenly Venerate actually would not purposely oppose the heaven and earth.

Yet Ling Han had forcefully reversed the grief of the heaven and earth, and there was no actual significance to it, either. What was the point?

According to a mighty figure, disobeying the heaven and earth would have extremely severe consequences, and even a Heavenly Venerate would have to be cautious.

Kuang!

The furious sound of thunder rang out in the heaven and earth, and bolts of lightning struck down rapidly, targeting Ling Han.

Initially, a transcendent dimension would have extremely great tolerance. Perhaps only when a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate unleashed his full power would he then be targeted. However, who asked Ling Han to purposely go against the heavens? This naturally enraged the heaven and earth.

Ling Han was unafraid, and merely looked coldly at the skies. His strength was not dependent on the heaven and earth, and it was completely based on himself alone.

‘My Dao uses myself as the core. Even if I am not in the form of a dimension, I myself am a dimension!’ Ling Han inwardly declared. Even if he were to be despised by the heaven and earth, and he would be completely blocked off from extracting the power of heaven and earth, he was not concerned at all.

This heavenly tribulation lasted for the whole period of half a month before dispersing, showing that the hatred that the heaven and earth had for Ling Han had reached an extremely high level.

When the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate reported Ling Han’s actions to the higher-ups at the Rising Clouds Heavenly Academy, it immediately caused a great commotion.

Some mighty figures supported the course of punishing Ling Han severely. This was a public breach of the rules of the martial academy, and it by itself was a great wrong. Furthermore, Yu Wudi was the son of a Heavenly Venerate. If such a matter was condoned, how were the Heavenly Venerates here supposed to focus on fighting?

Oh, if even the safety of their family could not be guaranteed, then whose families were they fighting to protect?

But there were also powerful figures that supported Ling Han. It was indeed Yu Wudi who had broken the rules first. Not only had he used his overwhelming power to bully, he had told others to gang up on Ling Jianxue. It was no wonder that Ling Han would be furious.

Of course, killing Wu Yudi had gone a little too far.

How was he to be dealt with?

Both arguments had their supporters, and no result was produced even after long periods of debate. They could only continue to forward the report further up the hierarchy, for it to be decided by those Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. After all, Ling Han was really too freakish. As a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he was capable of matching a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. This kind of talent was what the Genesis World needed the most.

Very soon, the powerful figures spoke. This action of Ling Han had gone too far, but because the Genesis World needed a prodigy like him, he would be allowed to redeem himself with battle merits. After he broke through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, he would be sent to fight in the Realm Battlefield.

This… was equivalent to no punishment at all.

When the news came out, this naturally almost killed the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate with fury. Yu Wudi was his only son, and he treasured him as much as his own life. For the sake of the latter’s future prospects, he had even deliberately sealed him, which showed what great expectations he had had for Yu Wudi.

But now, his son was gone.

He wanted to immediately charge back to fight to death with Ling Han, but he very soon suppressed this impulse.

Not even the Crimson Clouds was a match for Ling Han, and the Imperial Void would be even less of a match.

He begged for an audience with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. His master was extremely freakish, and was already a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate by now. If the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was willing to interfere, then suppressing Ling Han would naturally be a piece of cake.

“Master, please help me!” The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate knelt in front of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. Ever since advancing to the Celestial King Tier, he had practically never knelt in front of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable again, but now, for the sake of his son, he had fallen to his knees once more.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable sat calmly. After advancing to the Third Tier, his aura had become increasingly subtle. Being able to cultivate to the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier in such a barren place like the Celestial Realm represented astonishing natural talent by itself.

Hence, after the Sealed Emotion arrived at the Flaming Frost Realm, he enjoyed a great burst in cultivation level, but Third Tier was practically as far as he could go. Without any special circumstances, there would never be any hopes of him reaching Fourth Tier.

His eyes closed, he said lowly, “I have never expected that a mere pawn would actually develop to the level he has reached today.”

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was filled with even more resentment. Previously, he had wanted to kill Ling Han repeatedly, yet the latter had always managed to escape. If his resolution had been just the slightest bit firmer in the past, he might have already killed Ling Han by now. How could so many things have happened then?

“This line of Yuan Sheng… wishes to make a comeback?”

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s eyes snapped open, blazing light shooting right into the heavens.

“It would not be convenient to make a move in the martial academy, but ultimately, he would have to come here. Once he is on his way, I will personally move to snipe him!” He withdrew his gaze, and returned once more to that icy, dead man’s face.

“Thank you, Master!” The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was overjoyed.

With the interference of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, there was no doubt that Ling Han would die.

***

No one had expected that Ling Han would actually be able to resolve such a great crisis so easily, but upon deeper thought, if anyone could match a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate while he himself was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, wouldn’t he also get special treatment?

Moreover, it was Yu Wudi himself who had been courting death, and had been the first to break the rules.

And those at the Realm Battlefield had also heard of Ling Han’s story. A great many people felt rueful. That Ling Han from the past had returned once more. As expected of Demon King Ling, he had caused such a great commotion immediately upon his reappearance.

But Ling Han kept a very low profile. He just accompanied his son and grandson, and only once he had seen that Ling Jianxue’s and his son’s injuries were all healed did he set out with the Empress to search for the core of the Flaming Frost Realm.

This took them quite a few years, but there were a great many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that had taken this step here. Hence, the location of the core was no secret. Primarily, it was due to the time needed for the journey.

The core of a transcendent dimension was very hard to approach. The journey towards the core was fraught with considerable dangers. This had surpassed Regulations. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be killed by the slightest moment of carelessness.

Yet Ling Han and the Empress were both already Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and their battle prowess had reached the level of Second and First Tier Heavenly Venerate, respectively, so there naturally would not be much difficulty.

...

After 70-odd years, they finally arrived at the location of the core of the realm.

They could not approach it. An 18-colored light sphere was glowing radiantly, its beauty indescribable, but that kind of frightening wave of power caused even Ling Han to feel his heart jolt. He did not dare draw near to it at all.

“Be careful. You have defied the heavens previously, so it is extremely possible that you would be deliberately targeted by the heaven and earth,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded. He naturally had no fear of a heavenly tribulation, but the heaven and earth could hide away that unique power and prevent him from comprehending it. It was also possible that they would stimulate this power to attack him. Who asked him to take the initiative to come here?
