Chapter 2397: Dimension Scroll

Even the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was shocked for a long while before regaining his composure. He bowed again, and said, “My respects to Friend Zhou!”

This was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, an indescribably powerful being.

However, Zhou Heng maintained his innocent expression and a faint smile, and he said, “I have something to discuss with everyone.”

“Please come inside,” the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable said with a smile. He was extremely calm at this moment. If Zhou Heng wanted to target him, he naturally wouldn’t need to go to so much trouble. After all, a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate was far too powerful.

Zhou Heng nodded, and they all entered the Sealed Emotion Palace.

“I’ll invite the two others over as well,” Zhou Heng said. With a shake, two projections walked out from his body. Their appearance was identical to his.

The two projections tore open the void and left. After a short moment, both the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Heavenly Venerate Wu Le tore open the void, and arrived at almost the exact same time. Moreover, they both wore expressions of astonishment.

This was only natural. After all, who wouldn’t feel numb with shock after seeing a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate for the first time?

Zhou Heng was clearly someone who didn’t like to speak nonsense. He got straight to the point, and his words both shocked and delighted the three Heavenly Venerates.

They were shocked because their dream of transcendence was nothing more than that—a dream. Perhaps they could realize this dream, but it would quickly crumble into nothingness. After all, a monster such as Hysteria actually existed! At the same time, they were delighted because they would have the chance to advance to the Second Tier, Third Tier, or even Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier after entering the transcendent dimension!

Being able to become a Heavenly Venerate, which of them wasn’t a profoundly talented prodigy? Which of them was weaker than the other?

After Zhou Heng finished his explanation, not only were the Heavenly Venerates tempted, but even the Imperial Void Celestial King and the others were tempted. After all, they all yearned to enter a higher-level dimension. This would greatly aid their growth.

“Announce this to the world!”

The five Heavenly Venerates quickly reached a consensus. They would announce this to the world, and pick the most prodigious talents to head over to the transcendent dimension.

The Heavenly Venerates naturally didn’t need to attend to these trivial matters by themselves. They delegated these tasks to their disciples and grand-disciples.

The news spread, and the entire Celestial Realm went into uproar.

Of course, the five Heavenly Venerates didn’t reveal the existence of Hysteria. Instead, they first revealed the existence of the Realm Wars. They then claimed that they were bringing prodigies to a high-level dimension where they would be able to increase their development potential.

Countless prodigies surfaced, all gathering toward the meeting locations that had been set up by the various Celestial Kings. Those who were outstanding could further go to the places of enlightenment of the four Heavenly Venerates. There, Zhou Heng would decide whether to take them or not.

Ling Han, Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, and the others were all called over by Zhou Heng. This Heavenly Venerate had extremely high hopes for them, and there were some words that he wanted to say to them.

“Even though you can also ascend to the Celestial King Tier in the transcendent dimension, I hope that you can ascend to the Celestial King Tier here before heading over,” Zhou Heng said in a serious voice. “Only by becoming a Celestial King will you have the right to interact with the essence of Regulations. This is the foundation for you to comprehend the power of heaven and earth.

“Whichever dimension you’re born in is whichever dimension the Regulations will be easiest to grasp for you.

“This is your foundation.”

Zhou Heng paused for a moment before continuing, “The Celestial Path in this dimension is going to open in 30,000 years, so I’ll give you 40,000 years. At that time, regardless of whether you’ve become a Celestial King or not, I’ll take you to the transcendent dimension.”

“Thank you, Lord!” Ling Han and the others said. It was extremely rare to come across such an understanding Heavenly Venerate.

Something suddenly occurred to Ling Han, and he immediately retrieved the unopenable scroll, asking, “Lord, can I please ask you something? What’s this?”

Wally had only said that this scroll possessed some essence power of the Genesis World. However, he hadn’t explained the actual use of this scroll.

A strange sight appeared. Before, Ling Han couldn’t open this scroll no matter what. Now, however, it radiated with iridescent colors as it automatically unfurled by itself. Moreover, it even broke free from Ling Han’s grasp, hovering over to Ji Wuming. It swayed slightly, and it was as if it wanted him to grab it.

Zhou Heng smiled, and said, “This is a Dimension Scroll that only certain people can open. Whoever obtains it can immediately become a Heavenly Venerate.”

‘What?!’

Ji Wuming and the others were all astonished and tempted upon hearing this. They hadn’t even become Celestial Kings, yet they now had an opportunity to directly ascend the heavens? If they obtained this scroll, they could directly become a Heavenly Venerate?!

They found this extremely difficult to believe. How could such a heaven-defying item exist? Moreover, heaven and earth didn’t tolerate Heavenly Venerates, so why would heaven and earth try to conflict with itself?

However, Ling Han believed these words. This was because this scroll contained the foundation of the Genesis World—Void Particle Energy.

“It is in order to protect itself that heaven and earth has birthed such Dimension Scrolls,” Zhou Heng said with a sigh of emotion. “However, such power is bestowed by heaven and earth, so heaven and earth can naturally bestow it or take it back as it pleases. Moreover, if one becomes a Heavenly Venerate through the Dimension Scroll, their potential will be forever limited to the First Tier.”

Ling Han came to a realization. No wonder the Foreign Realm had such scrolls as well. As it turned out, this was a self-protection mechanism of heaven and earth—it wanted to create more powerful elites. However, heaven and earth also didn’t want to lose control over these powerful elites lest they affected the equilibrium of heaven and earth, so it possessed the ability to confiscate this power as well.

Moreover, if one became a Heavenly Venerate through the Dimension Scroll, their potential would be forever limited to the First Tier. They would be unable to transcend.

Cold sweat involuntarily formed on Ling Han’s back. Fortunately, he hadn’t been the person favored by heaven and earth. Otherwise, if he had rashly opened the scroll… Indeed, ascending the heavens in a single step would have been euphoric. However, he would have only been a paramount being in the Celestial Realm. He would have been unable to participate in the grand battle of the Genesis World.

However, heaven and earth had actually chosen Ji Wuming and not him?

Ling Han was slightly displeased about this. Did heaven and earth believe that Ji Wuming was a more suitable representative than him?

Ji Wuming shut his eyes, his hands trembling slightly.

He could ascend the heavens in a single step! How could he not waver?

However, after a short moment, he immediately steeled his resolve. He opened his eyes, and they were once again clear.

He shook his head, rejecting the offer from heaven and earth.

Zhou Heng reached over and suppressed the Dimension Scroll. He was powerful enough to even obliterate the Celestial Realm, so suppressing this Dimension Scroll was naturally as easy as could be.

He then tossed the scroll back to Ling Han. Turning around to glance at Ji Wuming, there was an expression of appreciation on his face.

Such kind of resolve was extremely rare. One had to realize that he had rejected the opportunity to become a Heavenly Venerate in a single step! This resolve was highly regarded by Zhou Heng.

Meanwhile, Shi Chanzi and the other monarch stars were all extremely envious. They could indeed become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, becoming a Heavenly Venerate was truly far too difficult. Just how many monarch stars had existed in history? However, how many of them had become Heavenly Venerates?

In the past dozen or so epochs, only the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had succeeded.

However, Ji Wuming had actually rejected this opportunity? They both admired him and felt jealous of him. Just how wonderful would it have been if the heavens had favored them instead?

“Lord Zhou, I have another question I want to ask,” Ling Han said. He explained the situation of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable before asking, “Dare I ask, Lord, is there any way to revive the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable?”

Zhou Heng was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and he was perhaps even more powerful than the Celestial Realm Dimension. Perhaps he would know a way to extract the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s divine sense, allowing him to reincarnate and recultivate.

However, Zhou Heng shook his head, and said, “He fused himself with the Heavenly Dao, and this is an irreversible process. To say nothing of me, even my master can’t do anything about this.”

Everyone became even more curious.

Zhou Heng was already a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, yet judging from his words, his master was clearly even more powerful. Perhaps he was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate?

“Lord Zhou, is your esteemed master a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What’s his title?”

Shi Chanzi, Jia Lan, and the others all transformed into inquisitive children as they asked these questions.

“Heh, my master is indeed a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. His name is Lin Luo,” Zhou Heng replied with a smile. He didn’t conceal this from them.

Lin Luo, Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate!
