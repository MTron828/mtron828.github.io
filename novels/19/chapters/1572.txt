1573 Ancient Realm!

The heavens were paramount, and even Saints and Demon Masters had to act according to the will of the heavens. Defying the heavens would mean facing heavenly tribulation, which could obliterate one’s body and soul.

What did it matter even if one were at the Genesis Tier? They would still have to face Immortal’s Calamity once every 100 million years. If they couldn’t overcome these tribulations, they would be cursed by misfortune. Thus, it would be useless even if they still had a lengthy lifespan—they wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of death.

As such, the heavens couldn’t be defied, nor could they be provoked.

However, just the name of “Heaven Crushing Alliance” was already offensive in and of itself. Moreover, the power of Genesis Tier Saints was intricately linked to the Regulations of heaven and earth. Thus, this was more the reason that they shouldn’t go about defying the heavens.

Ling Han was astonished. If they were a few lowly thieves, he would still understand. After all, those who were ignorant knew no fear. Thus, it was possible that they would found forces such as the Heaven Crushing Sect, Heaven Crushing Faction, and whatnot. However, even a Heaven Demon had joined such an organization. This was truly a rare sight.

Ouyang Taishan smiled as he continued to stroll forward, saying, “Young man, are you aware of how one can enter the Celestial Realm?”

“Fuse the Regulations of the two realms and blast open the passageway to the Celestial Realm,” Ling Han replied.

Ouyang Taishan nodded upon hearing this. “This sounds simple, but up until now, not a single person has managed to succeed. This is because it’s impossible to fuse the Regulations of the two realms.”

Ling Han was slightly taken aback. Hadn’t he succeeded in fusing them? Or was he able to fuse them so easily because he hadn’t reached the Genesis Tier yet? Perhaps this fusion would fall apart once he advanced to the next major tier?

“You’re an exception, so that’s why I’ve come to personally visit you,” Ouyang Taishan added.

‘So that’s how it is; I’m an exception.

‘Hang on, that can’t be right! Empress Luan Xing has also fused the Regulations of the two realms. Only the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden hasn’t managed to do so. She can only replace the Regulations of the Immortal Realm with the Regulations of the Netherworld. She can’t fuse them together no matter how I explain.

‘Perhaps this is because the Empress possesses a Divine Fetus?’

Ling Han didn’t speak. It was evident that Ouyang Taishan hadn’t come to merely take a look at him. Thus, all he needed to do was remain silent and listen.

“Young man, I’ll let you in on a secret.” Ouyang Taishan suddenly changed the topic, and said, “A long, long time ago—it’s already impossible to determine when exactly—the Netherworld and Immortal Realm were actually a single realm.”

‘What?!’

Ling Han’s eyes widened in shock. This was truly an explosive piece of news.

‘The Netherworld and Immortal Realm were a single realm?

‘Oh, that’s right, Small Tower has also said before that the Celestial Realm isn’t transcendent above the Immortal Realm. Rather, it’s just another part of the Immortal Realm. It’s just a little more special. Moreover, the Regulations are complete in the Celestial Realm, and there’s no notion of power of creation or power of destruction.

‘Could it be that the Immortal Realm was split into three at that time, one being the Celestial Realm, which preserved its original state but became much smaller? Then, the remaining section split into two and became the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld. However, this was a destructive division that not only split the land, but also split the Regulations.’

“That realm was called the Ancient Realm,” Ouyang Taishan continued. “In the Ancient Realm, the Celestial Realm was regarded as a special place where only those who reached the level of the Great Saint or Earth Demon were allowed to enter. There existed an undying Divine Essence there, and this was something that could continually aid one’s cultivation. In turn, it could help them obtain a lifespan that was as long as the heavens.

“One day, however, a great turmoil suddenly gripped the Celestial Realm. Or perhaps it was the Ancient Realm that was subject to an enormous transformation first. It was split into the Immortal Realm and Netherworld, and this in turn affected the existence of the Celestial Realm.

“You also know that the Celestial Realm experienced great turmoil at that time. Countless forces were massacred, and only a rare few people managed to escape. Some were also banished from the Celestial Realm, and they lost the right to obtain eternal life.

“Right now, the Ancient Realm exists as two separate realms, with the Regulation of each in stark opposition to the other. This has also birthed division between the Genesis Tier elites, who are now separated into Demon Masters and Saints. At the same time, this has also stripped anyone of the right from entering the Celestial Realm.

“If we want to change this, there’s only one possible option!”

A passionate glimmer suddenly appeared in Ouyang Taishan’s eyes, and he said, “We need to fuse the Netherworld and Immortal Realm and recreate the Ancient Realm!”

‘This... What a lofty aspiration! What a lofty goal!’

Ling Han was stunned. So this was the true aim of the Heaven Crushing Alliance. They didn’t desire to battle heaven and earth, but they instead desired to shatter the barrier that existed between the two opposing kinds of heaven and earth. They wanted to recombine the two opposing realms.

‘However, is this possible?’

As if reading Ling Han’s mind, Ouyang Taishan said, “These two realms were originally a single entity. Thus, it’s naturally possible to fuse them back together. In reality, the Two Realm Passageways that you see are the products of the instinct of the Ancient Realm. It wants to fuse the two realms back together again.”

‘So this is the true purpose of the Two Realm Passageways? This wasn’t caused by the conflict between the two realms, but is rather a product of the two realms wanting to fuse together? Through this method, it wants the two realms to interact with each other, and eventually recombine to form the Ancient Realm?’

“However, this process requires tens of billions of years, perhaps even trillions of years,” the old Heaven Demon continued. “Initially, we had no choice but to wait. Although we can help it along a little, the effects aren’t especially great. However, your appearance has changed everything.

“You can become a core and fuse the Regulations of the two realms. By doing so, you can increase the speed of fusion of the two realms exponentially.”

Ouyang Taishan wore a solemn expression as he gazed at Ling Han, and he said, “Right now, I’m officially inviting you to join the Heaven Crushing Alliance. As long as you accept, you can immediately become the Seventeenth Elder of the alliance. I can also promise you that we’ll do everything in our ability to raise you.”

Gasp!

Gou Li sucked in a sharp breath upon hearing this. Seventeenth Elder! What kind of glory was this?

Just how powerful were the 16 current elders of the Heaven Crushing Alliance?

They were all Heaven Demons and Saint Kings! Moreover, they had all reached the pinnacle stage of these levels.

In addition, there was no notion of rank among these 16 elders. Thus, even though Ling Han would be the Seventeenth Elder, his power and influence wouldn’t be weaker than that of the senior elder, second elder, ninth elder, or any of the other elders.

Even those who had just broken through to the level of Heaven Demon or Saint King didn’t have the right to become an elder, yet such a position was now being offered to a measly cultivator at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier! How could Gou Li not be stunned?

However, who told Ling Han to possess such an extraordinary ability? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Only he could fuse together the Regulations of the two realms!

Ling Han pondered for a moment before asking, “Dare I ask, Senior, who else is in the Heaven Crushing Alliance?”

Judging by his description, this was a supreme organization that spanned across the two realms. If the Eight Stones Forbidden Land were also a member of this alliance, then things would truly become a little sticky.

Ouyang Taishan listed the names of the members. There were the names of supreme elites, and there were also the names of powerful Forbidden Lands. Those who possessed the right to know about the Celestial Realm were generally all descendants of those who had been banished or those who had fled. Among these names, there was someone with the surname of Hu. This was the grand elder of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land.

Sure enough, a force as powerful as the Eight Stones Forbidden Land was also involved in this grand plan. In any case, there were eight Forbidden Lands from each of the Netherworld and Immortal Realm. However, the Dongchang Forbidden Land of the Tan Clan wasn’t one of them.

“Old Geezer Tan is a bit cowardly, and he’s afraid that interfering with the fusion of the two realms will result in punishment from the heavens,” Ouyang Taishan said, a look of disdain on his face.

In his eyes, there was no greater aspiration than trying to enter the Celestial Realm. Moreover, if they didn’t enter the Celestial Realm, their only fate would be dying of old age. As such, they were better off taking this gamble.

However, not all of the Forbidden Lands agreed with this reasoning. Fusing the two realms? In their eyes, this was a completely impossible task. Thus, they preferred to look for other means.

However, up until now, neither of the two sides had found any way to enter the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before shaking his head, and replying, “There’s some animosity between me and Eight Stones Forbidden Land.”

Ouyang Taishan faltered upon hearing this, and there was a strange expression on his face as he looked at Ling Han.

‘You’re really quite the troublemaker, aren’t you?’
