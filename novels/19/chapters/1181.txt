Chapter 1182: Killing Sha Yuan

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You, you are that mysterious man!” The four people from the Majestic Heaven Sect all pointed at Ling Han. Only now did they realize that this man could not possibly be the “bumpkin” that Sha Yuan had spoken of, but was instead the mysterious elite that had wounded Ji Zhengping with a single arrow.

Impossible!

When had there appeared yet another powerful king tier in the young generation? Just looking at that attack just now, it was definitely capable of matching those of He Tao, Wu Zhe, and the other king tiers.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he demanded, “Leave your Spatial Spirit Tools behind, then get lost!”

These people wanted to rob him, so there was naturally no reason for him to let them go unscathed. That would be letting them off too easy.

“Don’t go too far!” Ji Zhengping shouted in anger. However, as his shoulder was still streaming blood, it seriously impacted his image. He absolutely radiated no intimidation to speak of.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “The path that you have previously walked on had been too smooth, hadn’t it? To actually utter such naive words! Humph, in front of me, who do you think you are? If you do not obediently leave your Spatial Spirit Tools behind, then I will kill all of you!”

Ji Zhengping felt as if he had suffered a tremendous humiliation, yet he couldn’t help but think that he, too, had used the Viper Poison Explosive Pill as a threat. If they did not hand over the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill, he would kill them, and now they were just getting their just desserts.

Fair? In this world, whoever had the stronger power would represent what was fair.

“Well, aren’t you ruthless!” Ji Zhengping and the others all drew out their spatial rings, which they then threw onto the ground, appearing to be very indignant. They could all be considered geniuses, and it had always been them who could behave unscrupulously; when have they been humiliated like this before?

Sha Yuan, too, tossed out a spatial ring, and was just about to leave with Ji Zhengping and the others.

Ling Han broke into laughter in spite of himself, and said, “Young Master Sha, has your head been kicked by a donkey? Did I say you could leave?”

“Ling Han, you truly want to kill me? Aren’t you afraid that my father would fly into a rage, and race over here to take your wretched life?” Sha Yuan asked ferociously. Now that the decree had been destroyed, he had finally become truly afraid. When he spoke these words, he was merely putting on a fierce facade to hide his fear.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “With such a dishonest son like you, I believe that Great General Sha would not mind having one less.”

“Sir, you have already obtained riches, so why do you have to be so imperious?” a young man in blue advised. The five of them had come together, so he was naturally unwilling to see his companion being killed.

“If I have killed your whole family, then tell you, ‘Since they have all died, don’t be so forceful anymore’, would you be pleased or not?” Ling Han cast an eye on him, and then impatiently said, “In three breaths, all of you get lost. If not, you all can die with him!”

He was truly angered now, and his frightening aura was like an ocean, incredibly terrifying.

Ji Zhengping and the others were all shocked. This was definitely a king tier’s aura!

How could a king tier allow others to challenge their authority?

All their faces were pallid, and they all turned and left, not daring to say one more word of nonsense to avoid being killed by Ling Han together with Sha Yuan—since Ling Han had already decided to kill a key disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect, who furthermore was the son of a Heavenly Body Tier, it wouldn’t be a big issue to him to kill a few more key disciples and descendants of Heavenly Body Tier.

“Don’t leave, save me! Save me!” Sha Yuan was dumbfounded. This was the first time that he felt death was so near to him, causing him to feel cold all over.

Ji Zhengping and the others ignored his pleas, and ran away quickly.

Sha Yuan turned around blankly, looked at Ling Han for a while, and then suddenly said, “Don’t kill me! I can become your friend! I am the son of an elite of Heavenly Body Tier. If you have a friend like me, that would definitely not be a loss to you!”

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “I really do not want to say such things to scare you! However, since you feel so good about yourself, if I did not give you a bit of a blow, I really couldn’t live with myself. On the topic of friends, I have a friend who is a Saint. Furthermore, the empress herself would be my wife in future. This friendship of yours... sigh, I really couldn’t care less.”

Sha Yuan was gaping in open-mouthed shock. ‘You must f****** be lying to me!’

Saint!

How could that be? Only those in the Genesis Tier could be called Saints. If you were able to be friends with a Saint, then wouldn’t you be able to do as you liked in this world? And you actually said you wanted to marry the empress? Pei

, how noble and remote was Her Imperial Majesty, the empress? Even his old man could only salivate in secret, so what right did Ling Han have to say so?

“You are a man who is about to die, so there is no need to deceive you. However, there is also no need for me to force you to believe me.” Ling Han smiled. “Are you prepared to die now?”

Sha Yuan only felt a coldness all over his whole body. His legs involuntarily weakened, and he was down on his knees, weeping, “Don’t kill me! I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die!”

“That’s right. No one wants to die!” Ling Han raised his hand. “But for the sake of your selfish desires, you coveted the fated opportunities I have achieved, and sent assassins to hunt me down and kill me. I fear that if I had not had a few tricks up my sleeve, grass would have already long started growing on my grave.”

He threw out a punch, and a terrifying power descended. Pa, Sha Yuan had instantly exploded into nothing, both his figure and spirit destroyed, turning into a bloody mist that filled the air. There was not even a complete part of his corpse left behind.

“Hey, handsome, now that you have killed a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect, would you want to kill us as well to keep the secret?” Meng Wei swallowed with much difficulty.

The others all hurriedly cast looks at their leader as if to say “Why the f*** are you asking him that? Why don’t we just play dumb, then secretly sneak away? Now that you asked, aren’t you simply reminding him of that?”.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “It’s fine. In any case, I have already let four people flee, so I would not mind leaving a few more people alive... You guys aren’t planning to tell on me, are you?”

Meng Wei and his group hurriedly shook their heads in denial.

“That’s great.” Ling Han picked up the spatial rings that Ji Zhengping and his group had left behind, and drew out the items inside one after another. Then, he stored them into the Black Tower.

If he placed them in his own spatial ring, then what if they were found in the future? He would then be identified as the murderer. But if he placed them in the Black Tower, who would be able to find them there?

“Handsome, this bottle of Berserk Blood Spirit Pills is yours.” Meng Wei handed over the alchemical pill bottle she had just gained.

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “Haven’t we decided to split equally?”

“You have saved us another time. Furthermore, we have also obtained so many pill recipes, so we have already greatly profited! As humans, we should not be too greedy.” Meng Wei shook her head.

“All right.” Ling Han accepted the alchemical pills. In the process of obtaining the treasure trove here, it was him who worked the hardest, so even if he took an additional bottle—even if it was a bottle, there was actually only a single alchemical pill inside—it would not be too much to ask.

“Then, handsome, we will excuse ourselves here!” Meng Wei clasped her hands, and when Ling Han nodded, she added, “You really don’t want to have some nice goodbye s*x?”

“F*ck off!”

After they watched Meng Wei and his group leave, Ling Han and his group also set out. However, Ling Han’s attention had been drawn to the pill recipes that he had just obtained.

He would definitely be unable to concoct an alchemical pill above Level Five, as the requirement for his divine sense was rather big. However, he could barely be capable of Level Five. After all, his spirit was continuously being tempered by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and was far stronger than the spirit of an ordinary Mountain River Tier. Moreover, he had also stepped into the pinnacle level.

He searched for a while, and discovered that, astonishingly, the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill Recipe was amongst these pill recipes!
