Chapter 2584: Arrival of the Yin River Celestial King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Regulation of Space.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. When A’Yuan had unsheathed his sword, a peculiar fluctuation had rippled across space. This was a sign of him wielding the Regulations of Space. It was also because of this that his thrust was so astonishingly quick. The sound of him unsheathing his sword had only just traveled over, yet the tip of his blade had already made contact with Ling Han’s clothes.

His mastery of the Regulations of Space was truly impressive. Otherwise, his thrust couldn’t possibly have been so quick.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he also wielded the Regulations of Space.

An eerie scene appeared. Even though A’Yuan continued to advance, with his sword continuing to thrust forth, he was unable to strike Ling Han no matter what. It was as if this mere half an inch had suddenly become an insurmountable distance.

A’Yuan frowned upon seeing this. He naturally realized what was going on. Ling Han was also using the Regulations of Space to oppose him.

After reaching the Celestial King Tier, what they used to do battle was none other than Regulations. This was especially the case when both sides wielded the same Regulations. In that case, the person who had more mastery over the Regulations would gain an advantage.

Was his mastery inferior to Ling Han’s?

Utterly impossible!

He was a supreme monarch star! At the same cultivation level, who could suppress him?

“Freeze!” With a wave of his left hand, he attempted to forcefully freeze space and trap Ling Han.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “I can shatter all Regulations with my raw strength, and you still want to freeze me?”

Peng!

He punched at the air, and the space around him instantly shattered like glass. How could the Regulations of Space possibly trap him?

One had to realize that Ling Han’s Body Art was already powerful enough to face ordinary Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings head-on. As such, how could Regulations at the Fourth Heaven trap him? Even supreme monarch stars couldn’t succeed.

“Unleash your full strength. Otherwise, you’ll be killed within 10 strikes,” Ling Han said. He was brimming with confidence.

A’Yuan remained silent. However, he immediately brandished his sword and created a strange symbol. A devastating aura instantly emanated from his body, and it was as if a primordial beast had awoken and was roaring in rage.

Whoosh!

He unleashed a completely different sword technique, and his slash was so powerful that it was as if heaven and earth were about to lose their luster.

Ling Han stepped back in retreat. A’Yuan’s battle prowess was far too terrifying at this moment. If Ling Han didn’t unleash his full strength, it would truly be a struggle to deal with him. However, he still wanted to witness the might of this sword technique, so he merely retreated and allowed A’Yuan to continue with his attacks.

“Hurry up and capture him!” Lu Li shouted. He instantly regained his confidence after seeing A’Yuan gain the upper hand.

“Leave!” A’Yuan said coldly. Others didn’t know, but he was extremely aware that Ling Han’s battle prowess was superior to his. Right now, he could only suppress Ling Han because he had activated a secret technique, allowing his battle prowess to increase threefold. However, this wouldn’t last for long.

Moreover, it was clearly impossible for him to suppress and capture Ling Han in such a short amount of time. Thus, the only thing he could do was obstruct Ling Han.

‘What?!’

Lu Li was deeply astonished. He was extremely confident in A’Yuan as this was someone who could achieve victory even when he was at a disadvantage in terms of cultivation level. This was to say nothing about opponents at the same cultivation level.

Now, however, A’Yuan was actually telling him to leave? What did this signify?

This signified that A’Yuan lacked the confidence to defeat Ling Han! It was because of this that he was telling him to leave.

Gasp!

Even though Lu Li felt extremely displeased, he trusted A’Yuan’s judgment without reservations.

This person didn’t speak much, and he was definitely someone whose actions spoke louder than his words. Since he felt like he was weaker than Ling Han, this definitely wasn’t a case of him being humble. Instead, he was truly inferior to Ling Han.

Lu Li immediately turned around to leave. Moreover, he was running instead of walking.

If even A’Yuan couldn’t stop Ling Han, then he could only seek his father for help. Or he could seek out that other person who was even more powerful than his father.

Tang Yuan saw all of this, and a cold smile involuntarily appeared on his face. Wasn’t Lu Li extremely mighty? Yet, he was still scared off by his underling.

Ling Han humphed as he dashed toward Lu Li like lightning.

“Stay here!” A’Yuan roared. Wielding the Regulations of Space, his speed was also immense as he thrust at Ling Han’s back.

Ling Han furrowed his brows. A’Yuan was extremely powerful, especially after he had activated some kind of secret technique. This caused his battle prowess to become even more powerful, so much so that even Ling Han didn’t dare to face this attack head-on.

He abandoned his pursuit of Lu Li, instead turning around to throw a punch at A’Yuan’s sword.

Boom!

His fist struck the tip of the blade, unleashing a devastating shock wave that instantly slammed the nearby people to the ground.

However, Lu Li had been the first to flee, so he wasn’t hit by this shock wave. He started to flee even quicker.

No matter what, he was also a Celestial King—a Second Heaven Celestial King at that. Thus, if he decided to flee, even Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings wouldn’t be able to catch him.

“Your opponent is me!” A’Yuan shouted in a cold voice.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “However, it’s a shame that you’re no match for me.”

“I possess a peerless Sword Heart that can sever all matter!” A’Yuan said. His voice was calm, and his fighting spirit wasn’t affected in the least.

Ling Han roared with laughter, saying, “Alright then, let us have a hearty battle!”

He unleashed his full strength, drawing on the Great Dao with his hands. He then activated his Body Art, causing his battle prowess to directly soar to the Seventh Heaven.

Regardless of how powerful A’Yuan was, he was still limited by his aptitude as a supreme monarch star. Even though he had activated a secret technique to increase his battle prowess, how could this possibly rival Ling Han’s Body Art?

He was suppressed in all facets, instantly falling to a disadvantage.

Tang Yuan and the others were all shocked upon seeing this. They hurriedly turned around to flee. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even Lu Li had fled, so it was clear that the situation had already spiraled out of control. That being the case, why would they stay here to seek death?

Ling Han’s fighting spirit was also excited, and he threw both of his fists forward. There was only battle on his mind.

Peng!

In just a dozen or so punches, A’Yuan was struck and sent flying. Only after shattering three large boulders did he come to a stop. Even though he couldn’t pick himself up no matter how he tried, his right hand still tightly gripped the hilt of his sword, not loosening in the slightest.

Ling Han leaped up, dashing toward Tang Yuan. Since they had already fallen out, he would bring on bloodshed.

He was far too quick, and he had only given chase a little after Tang Yuan had started fleeing. Activating the Regulations of Space, he rapidly closed in on Tang Yuan.

Tang Yuan looked back, and his face immediately became green with fear. He hurriedly fled with all his might.

However, with three quick flashes, Ling Han had already arrived behind Tang Yuan. He unleashed a single punch.

“Humph!”

Following a cold humph, a terrifying force slammed toward Ling Han, triggering the Regulations of heaven and earth as it did so. This force transformed into a colossal palm that viciously thrust toward Ling Han.

Apprehension instantly gripped Ling Han’s heart. With a quick turn, he managed to successfully evade this strike.

However, the devastating wind whipped up by this strike caused his clothes to flutter and his flesh to hurt.

This was a formidably powerful person.

Ling Han turned around, only to see a young man standing behind him. He was dressed in a gray robe that was decorated with a flowing river. Looking closely, however, he realized that this river was actually flowing in a tumultuous manner and radiating with an eerie aura.

Most importantly, this person actually had seven ribbons of iridescent light around him.

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

“Lord Yin River!” Tang Yuan exclaimed. After escaping from the clutches of death, he couldn’t help but feel boundless delight.

‘Lord Yin River?’

This person was the Azure Ghost Celestial King’s disciple, the Yin River Celestial King!

The Yin River Celestial King wore a look of disdain as he glanced at Ling Han, saying, “After seeing me, you’re still not going to surrender?”

Ling Han smiled faintly. Judging from his attack, this Yin River Celestial King was no ordinary Seventh Heaven Celestial King. Instead, he was a monarch tier. This signified that his battle prowess was infinitesimally close to the Eighth Heaven.

It was no wonder that his attack had been so devastating.

“If I want to kill someone, even you can’t stop me!” Ling Han said.
