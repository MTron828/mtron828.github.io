Chapter 1633: Drinking the Heavenly Tribulation Fluid

The Empress directly ejected her nine doppelgangers, receiving the attacks of the heavenly tribulation.

She had always been aggressive and assertive, and now that there were no outsiders here, she naturally had no need to worry that her trump cards would be known to others. From the beginning, her battle prowess was on full throttle, and she was beating the lightning giant.

So what if it was Saint King Tier? In front of the present Empress, it was no longer in a lofty, superior position, but rather was an opponent that she could face, and even suppress.

Ling Han, though, was not as relaxed as the Empress. He still had to allow his Godly bones to be tempered, but the gap in cultivation level was too wide. He did not dare to shatter his own body like he had done in the past. Instead, he received the power of lightning directly into his body, and used a more “moderate” method to temper his Godly bones.

But if anyone had seen it, they would definitely exclaim loudly that he was a freak. He called that moderate?

That was an attack from a Saint King Tier, and you were actually using it to temper your body. Were you tired of living?

This husband and wife were definitely freaks among freaks. One easily endured the heavenly tribulation, while the other treated the heavenly tribulation like a natural furnace to temper himself.

Unfortunately, Ling Han did not dare to enter deeply into the tribulation clouds to get more Heavenly Tribulation Fluid this time round. His present battle prowess was only capable of matching the early stage of Saint King Tier, but if he entered into the depths of the tribulation clouds, not only would there be peak stage Saint Kings, their number was frighteningly high too.

His present physique still could not hold up to the barrage from so many Saint Kings. Perhaps he would be able to make an attempt when he next broke through to the Saint King Tier.

After the heavenly tribulation, Ling Han and the Empress exchanged a smile. At present, they were confident enough to face all their strong enemies in the Ancient Realm—it was the Ancient Realm, not just the Immortal Realm. That was because they had simultaneously cultivated the Regulations of the two Realms, which were perfectly merged. Whether it was the Immortal Realm or the Netherworld, they could completely release their full battle prowess.

“Are we going to seek out those guys immediately for vengeance?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han considered for a moment, and then answered, “No, let’s try to merge the Regulations of the two Realms first. If the Ancient Realm could really be merged in our hands, that would be a great merit, and the benefits we obtain would be indescribably generous.”

In the past, he had come through opening the sky, and had thus been rewarded by the heaven and earth. His power had been a whole three stars stronger than his peers in the Shattering Void Tier, and there were too many small worlds. You could open the sky, and so could I, but for the Ancient Realm?

There was only one!

Since opening the sky of a small world was already so amazing, then if they merged the two Realms, how nature-defying would their merit be?

The Empress nodded. They were both people who were determined to become Celestial Kings, so it was naturally better for their battle prowess among their peers to be stronger.

The two of them entered into the Black Tower. The Empress stabilized her cultivation level, while Ling Han still had to set out again on his path of formations in addition to stabilizing his cultivation level.

Ling Han had already accumulated enough on the path of formations. When he had unraveled tens of thousands of formations in a Mystery Realm, his foundations had also become incredibly deep and resounding, and added with his frequently discussing formations with the Tranquil Heart Saint, his knowledge of formations was actually not inferior to the Tranquil Heart Saint’s any longer, aside from Saint-level formations.

He focused on studying. Time passed under the Reincarnation Tree. In the outside world, three years had passed, and underneath the Reincarnation Tree, 100,000 had passed!

Ling Han’s eyes suddenly snapped open. He had advanced into the Saint Tier in formations!

However, the Tranquil Heart Saint was only a Small Saint. Thus, his knowledge of formations also stopped at the level of Small Saint Tier. The experience related to formations that he had taught to Ling Han was also only limited to the Small Saint Tier.

To Ling Han, was there any more meaning to Small Saint Tier formations?

No!

However, he still had Celestial level formations.

With his present Godly bones, it was naturally impossible for them to bear the might of Celestial level formations. Furthermore, even if they could, he would not be able to activate a Celestial level formation, either, as he didn’t have the ability at all. However, Celestial level formations could be used as reference, so wouldn’t it work with a slightly weaker version?

He went into another long period of seclusion. A year had passed, and he had disassembled a portion of a Celestial level formation. Its strength was comparable to the peak stage Great Saint Tier!

Ling Han inscribed the formation patterns on his Godly bones with the Nine Heavens Flame as his blade.

If he did not depend on the might of formations, his battle prowess was comparable to the early stage of Great Saint Tier, and if he activated the formations, then he would not have to fear even peak stage Saint Kings.

He broke into a smile. These four years had been worthwhile!

After entering into the Saint Tier, there was practically no alchemical pill in this world that could allow him to swiftly boost his cultivation level. If it was not for the fact that he had cultivated to the pinnacle at the Eternal River Tier, and entered into the peak stage of the low extreme upon breaking through to the Genesis Tier, he would probably have been unable to fully cultivate to even the early stage of the Small Saint Tier now.

Just take a look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She was still advancing with much difficulty in the early stage of the Small Saint Tier, and completely did not have the sharp progress that she had once had.

Furthermore, this was also taking into account that she had the inheritance from the three Phoenix Kings, and her cultivation rate was much faster than any other Saint’s.

By now, if he wanted their cultivation rates to speed up, there was only Saintly medicine left, but how many Saintly medicines were there in the entire Ancient Realm?

Ling Han was now stuck in a dilemma.

On one hand, he wanted to cultivate to the Saint King Tier in the Ancient Realm. Then, he would be able to enter into the depths of the thunderclouds another time, and collect the Heavenly tribulation Fluid. On the other hand, he also wanted to enter quickly into the Celestial Realm. With how bountiful the resources of the Celestial Realm were, there would definitely be countless Saintly medicine, and even Celestial medicine was possible.

“Hmm...”

Ling Han pondered deeply for a while, and made his decision. “When I undergo the Great Saint tribulation, I will enter into the depths of the tribulation clouds to collect Heavenly Tribulation Fluid again. I’m sure that with my strength then, there should still be some hope.

“If it is possible, I will see who would be undergoing a heavenly tribulation, and take the initiative to draw the might of the heavenly tribulation to me so I can harvest to my heart’s content.

“Hehe, this is not a bad idea. In any case, I will have to reach the Great Saint Tier to be able to open the doors to the Celestial Realm.

“Let’s see exactly what benefits the Heavenly Tribulation Fluid can bring first.”

Ling Han drew out the Heavenly tribulation Fluid, and took a small sip. Suddenly, pa, pa, pa, pa, his whole body was blazing with lightning, and it was as if his entire body would be turned into lightning. He could clearly feel that there was lightning raging in his body. His Godly bones couldn’t hold up at all, and were beginning to crumble.

Gasp!

It was too violent. It should be known that he presently was a Medium Saint, and the strength of his Godly bones had soared up to the strength of Level 20 Godly metal. Even if it was not as strong as that, it would not be too far off, either, yet they were actually beginning to collapse under the force of the lightning.

“As expected... if I were to barge into the depths of the thunderclouds at this moment, that would only be an act to court death,” Ling Han mumbled in a trembling voice. “Small Tower was also right in not allowing me to share the Heavenly tribulation Fluid with others. For those below Celestial level, I should be the only one that can bear such a barrage!”

Even the Empress would not be able to!

Though she could distribute any attack that she sustained, drinking the Heavenly Tribulation Fluid meant that lightning would be running berserk directly in one’s body. Her nine doppelgangers would have no use at all.

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll with all his might.

Now, he was already a Medium Saint, and after channelling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, what level of strength would his physique be capable of reaching?

His Godly bones were slowly beginning to heal. This violent power of lightning actually did not manage to cause the slightest damage to him.

However, the time that this kind of condition could be maintained was limited.

After 30 minutes, Ling Han released a sharp cry. Pa, pa, pa, pa. The Godly bones that he had just healed shattered once again. His skin split, and blood sprayed out madly.

Damn, damn, he had clearly only taken a small sip, but why was its might so powerful?

Damn, stupid Small Tower, why hadn’t it said clearly from the beginning? This was not just not a small sip; he had to take a small sip of a small sip.

“You tsundere Tower, if I don’t throw you into the toilet in future, I will take your surname!” Ling Han shouted out in pain.
