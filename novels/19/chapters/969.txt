Chapter 970: Greater Danger Lies Behind

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

It was a Beast King in the consummate level, but it had just advanced into this cultivation level. Though it had formed four Mountains, it merely had three Rivers, and the fourth Mountain was clearly slightly smaller.

In this Mystery Realm, consummate level was practically invincible, but at present, this powerful Beast King was being played around with in the palm of Ling Han’s hand. It was only a breath away from death.

After Ling Han had drawn the bowstring for who knew how many times to threaten it, this Beast King was already too weak to activate the divine flame. Its whole body was sprawled on the ground, and it merely released angered growls from its nostrils. However, its intimidation aura had already ebbed away like waves.

The Beast King, at this time, was like a phoenix that had lost its feathers—no match for even a chicken.

However, as the saying went, a centipede died, but never fell down—what more when it was a consummate level Beast King. Its battle prowess was possibly two or three stars higher than its actual cultivation level. As long as it had not breathed its last, one should not underestimate it.

Ling Han did not make any rash moves. His stamina had already recovered completely, and his Origin Power was also close to complete recovery with the aid of True Origin Stones. Hence, he naturally would not mind wasting a bit more time on the Beast King.

The Beast King was panting, its single eye still bearing a ferocious look, but its vitality was becoming dimmer and dimmer.

How much longer would he have to wait?

Half a day, a whole day, or three days? Even if such a powerful Demonic Beast was about to die, it could possibly take a considerable number of days to actually die.

Ling Han did not have much patience. He feared he would be expelled by the Mystery Realm the moment time was up, and by then, the seven Mountain River Stones underneath the beast would have nothing to do with him. He decided to take a risk; his confidence lay in his powerful physique and recovery abilities.

He walked towards that Beast King.

“Seventh Uncle, this time, we’ve brought the Crimson Ground Locking Net; we will definitely be able to subdue that Beast King!” In the Flame Cave, there were four people currently journeying towards the innermost depths of the cave. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This group of theirs was considerably powerful. Any Demonic Beast they encountered would only be killed instantly under their combined forces, so there were almost no pauses in their advance.

“Hehe, the clan has prepared more than 1000 years for this, and finally successfully forged the Crimson Ground Locking Net. As long as it is in the net, it would be forcibly be suppressed onto a lower minor level.” An old man smiled, stroking his beard.

Among the four of them, only he had a head of white hair—the other three were all young men. However, their cultivation was not weak. The one with the lowest cultivation level was still in the late stage of the low extreme, while the remaining two were in the peak stage of the low extreme.

Otherwise, they would not have been able to sweep aside all obstacles on their way here.

If Ling Han saw them, he would realize that these four were from the Luo Clan. Before entering the Mystery Realm, they had clearly exposed their killing intent. However, after entering the Mystery Realm, they appeared randomly in separate places, which gave them no opportunity to meet.

“Damn it, we did not encounter that ant from a small world all this while!” a young man said suddenly.

“Hehe, you don’t have to take it to heart. Even if we did not encounter him, so be it. In any case, the Dark Night Hall has already accepted the mission; that brat will definitely not be able to escape his death! The priority this time is to kill that Beast King in order to obtain the Flame Mountain River Stones,” the old man said seriously.

“Yes!” the other three young men replied solemnly.

Although this elder’s talent was not high, and he only became a four-star genius through secret techniques and could not possibly ever have any further room for improvement, his abilities were firmly above them—at least for now. Furthermore, he had sacrificed the little opportunity he initially possessed to advance for the sake of contributing to the clan, so he had to be respected.

The old man nodded, and said, “That Beast King is an existence at the peak stage of the high extreme. Even if it is weakened by a minor level, it is still at the peak stage of the medium extreme, and the Lava Beast, by nature, can use divine flame. The battle prowess of the Beast King should still reach the early stage of the high extreme, so we must not be careless.”

“Rest assured, Seventh Uncle. We all have God Tools in hand, which would be enough to raise our battle prowess by another star. As long as you tie down the Beast King and distract it, we will be able to deal it a severe injury and forcibly drag it to death,” a young man said.

“En, what is important is this kind of determination!” The old man was very pleased.

Ling Han drew near, yet the Beast King did not have much of a reaction. It was as if it was so severely wounded that it did not even have the strength to raise a paw.

“Hehe, if you keep on playing dead, then I will directly deal with you!” Ling Han concentrated his divine sense, and suddenly delivered an attack with the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique.

It was not of much use before, as the Beast King’s cultivation level was too high, so its divine sense was naturally superior to his. If he’d used a spiritual attack against it, he would likely have been thrown back with an agonizing pain in his head as if it was about to break apart.

But it was different now. This Beast King was already at the end of its rope, so its divine sense was already in extreme decline.

Hong!

The Beast King suddenly raised its claws and smacked out towards Ling Han.

This strike was still extremely forceful and fierce.

“Haha, I scammed you all the time, so I’ll take a strike from you head on once so that you will not feel wronged in death!” Ling Han did not duck into the Black Tower. Instead, he delivered a full-force strike to counter the attack.

Weng , his palms shone with brilliant golden light, and Earth Overturning Seal activated, forming multiple divine patterns on his palms.

Peng!

He took the attack from the Beast King head on, and his whole figure was instantly sent flying. The strength of both sides was completely on different levels.

“Wa!” Ling Han’s body slammed into the cave wall, and bounced back. He sprawled down on the ground, opened his mouth, and spat out a mouthful of blood. He wiped the corner of his lips, and felt as if all the blood in his body was boiling, which was a great suffering.

“As expected of the consummate level, your strength is truly amazing!” Ling Han got back up. Pa, pa, pa , a few dislocated bones instantly popped back into place.

His physique was really too powerful. Even the strike from a consummate level Demonic Beast was unable to break his bones, and merely dislocated some of his joints. Of course, this was also because the Beast King was severely injured, and could not possibly release its most powerful strength.

The Beast King’s single eye stared at him. Its gaze was filled with shock, confusion, and fury, but there was also a sliver of defeat.

Its full-power blow still could not kill this human. Dying in the hands of this human... there was no injustice.

In the first place, it was already dying, and after forcing releasing a full-power blow, it was adding salt to the wound. It could not even manage to open its eye anymore, and its single eye slowly closed again.

“I shall send you on the last lap of your journey!” Ling Han shot out an attack with the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique, and stunned this Beast King, taking it into the Black Tower. He would use his supreme power to kill this Beast King so it needed not suffer any further.

Ling Han’s gaze turned towards the seven Mountain River Stones on the black stone, and a smile floated on his lips. After searching so hard and for so long, it was finally time for him to reap his rewards.

‘Hm?’

His sensitive divine sense had discovered an odd movement, and he immediately turned around.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu . Four people suddenly pounced inside through the entrance, one old and three younger. Each one of them held onto the corner of a huge net, and with the stimulation of their Origin Power, caused this giant net to exude a crimson light.

They were naturally the four members of the Luo Clan. They had taken out the Crimson Ground Locking Net at the entrance, and activated it ahead of time. Then, they leaped in, wanting to ambush that Beast King and use this divine net to entrap it.

But only after they suddenly rushed in did they discover that there was no sign of the Beast King. Instead, there was merely a young man staring at them.

“It’s you!” The four suddenly recognized him. Wasn’t this precisely that ant from a small world?

“Hahahaha, this is really traveling far and wide to look for you, only to find you easily!” One of the young men laughed loudly.
