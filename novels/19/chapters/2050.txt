Chapter 2051: Equally matched

The green sword was as transparent as crystal, an ancient seal glowing slightly on it, possessing a frightening aura that could cut the heaven and earth.

Immediately, a strong feeling of warning rose up in Ling Han. He felt that if he was struck by this sword, his arm would be severed if it struck his arm, his leg would be severed if it struck his leg, and if it struck his neck, he would be dead.

He did not dare take it head-on. With repeated taps of his feet, he used Lightning Flash, and rapidly retreated, as if he himself was a bolt of lightning.

However, while he retreated very quickly, Ji Wuming’s pursuit was not the slightest bit slow, either. The green sword danced and waved, shooting out multiple streaks of terrifying Sword Qi.?Shua, shua, shua,?even the dimension itself was cut to bits, releasing a wail of grief, as if it was about to be destroyed.

This sword… was too extraordinary.

“This is the Severed Passion Sword,” Ji Wuming stated calmly. “A Celestial Tool that I forged when I advanced into Celestial King Tier. It has fought battles with me for many years, but after I advanced into the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, I buried the Severed Passion Sword.

“To cut through your physique, I have deliberately dug out the Severed Passion Sword once more. You can also feel honored.”

A Celestial Tool!

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder he instinctively felt fear and that he could not be touched by this sword. As it turned out, this was a Celestial Tool.

Thankfully, Ji Wuming was also unable to unleash the full might of the Divine Sword. Otherwise, if the Celestial Tool exploded with might, to say nothing of the fact that Ling Han was only a Dividing Soul Tier, even if he was an Ascending Origin Tier great elite, he would only be killed with a single strike.

In Ji Wuming’s hands, even a Celestial Tool was only an incredibly sharp and indestructible weapon. It could not be considered a genuine Celestial Tool.

Of course, if he could easily unleash its might without reservations, Ling Han also had the previous tool of a Heavenly Venerate. If the Tower of Three Realms showed its might, even Celestial Kings would probably have to call out for help.

Right?

“That’s right. If I show my might, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be no match!” Small Tower declared proudly. However, its next words disappointed Ling Han. “However, firstly, I am severely wounded and not yet recovered, and secondly, I cannot be discovered by a few old monsters, so you will have to depend on yourself now.”

‘F*** your sister!’

Ling Han shook his head. Small Tower was really too undependable.

He dodged continuously, and would occasionally launch a powerful offensive from afar as well, exerting pressure on Ji Wuming. However, their present strength was actually considerably close, and only a true close-quarters battle would have might.

Hence, Ling Han’s barrage of punches only managed to hinder Ji Wuming slightly, but was completely unable to change this situation in which he was being beaten down on.

How was he going to match the Severed Passion Sword?

Ling Han pondered the question internally. Use the Divine Demon Sword to parry?

No way!

He immediately shook his head. The Divine Demon Sword was presently only the equivalent of a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool. In front of a true Divine Sword, it was definitely going to be snapped with a single strike.

How was he going to parry?

Great Clash of Source Powers?

Ling Han still shook his head. To deal with a most powerful opponent like Ji Wuming, he had to draw the distance between the two of them close enough, and then unleashing a powerful move would truly create the expected effects. Otherwise, it would only be able to cause light injury.

“You are very extraordinary. If this was several million years ago, I would take you as my disciple, and teach you earnestly, placing all my hopes on you.” Ji Wuming moved with sword in hand, his white robes fluttering elegantly, his graceful bearing captivating.

“Unfortunately, I am no longer who I once was!”

Ji Wuming formed a hand sign, and his sword intent immediately swept out like a flood, with Sword Qi like waves, madly slicing towards Ling Han.

Even though it was just Sword Qi, that was an assault launched from a Celestial Tool, so every single streak was incredibly terrifying. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Pu, pu, pu.?These Sword Qi were too close to one another, and Ling Han could not dodge them completely no matter what he did. Immediately, his arms, legs, and lower abdomen were struck, rivers of blood flowing out.

He couldn’t help but feel astonished. This was still the result when had even been actively channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and boosted his defenses greatly. Otherwise, these Sword Qi would have sliced him to bits.

A Celestial Tool was truly a Celestial Tool. Even if it was still dormant, merely the slightest bit of aura sweeping out was incredibly frightening.

No wonder a Celestial King was high and lofty, and even Ascending Origin Tiers could only admire them. They really were too powerful.

“And now, you can die!” Ji Wuming declared menacingly. His face was expressionless as he planned to kill Ling Han, a super prodigy.

Shua, the sword swept out like an eternal mountain that supported the heaven and earth, planning to destroy everything.

Ling Han roared furiously, and suddenly brandished a fist, which he launched at the Severed Passion Sword.

Ji Wuming’s eyes narrowed. Had this brat gone mad? He actually planned to use his physical body to bear up against a Celestial Tool? Did he think he was a Celestial King?

Crack!

The Severed Passion Sword struck Ling Han’s fist, yet a majestic light that could induce blindness burst out. One after another, seals lit up, from the size of the palm of a hand to the size that could envelop the heaven and earth, and rippled out for millions and millions of miles.

The sword had been blocked.

‘What?!’

Even Ji Wuming looked surprised. He definitely did not believe that Ling Han could stand forcefully against the Severed Passion Sword with his mere physical body, but the truth was the exact opposite.

Could it be that he could distrust his own eyes?

“En?” Ji Wuming’s eyes focused on a black ring that Ling Han wore on his middle finger. It was plain and unadorned, looking like any ordinary metal, but the blade of the Severed Passion Sword had been blocked because it had landed precisely on this ring.

It actually managed to block the sharpness of a Celestial Tool?

This also had to be a Celestial Tool—if it wasn’t a Celestial Tool, it definitely had to be Divine Metal. Otherwise, it definitely wouldn’t be able to accomplish this.

“I have really underestimated you!” Ji Wuming withdrew the sword, his eyes burning hot. “You… are a man of great fortune!”

Ling Han’s heart was also beating madly. He knew that the black ring was extraordinary, and even the Divine Demon Sword could not swallow it. It was very possibly Divine Metal, but that had only been his deduction. Furthermore, even if it was Divine Metal, this thing was too small. Whether it could protect even his whole fist was a mystery.

However, he had not been willing to admit defeat, and was not willing to be suppressed by Ji Wuming. Ultimately, he decided to make a risky attempt.

The result was unexpectedly excellent.

“Are you jealous?” Ling Han waved his fist, his fighting spirit blazing. The true battle had only begun now.

Ji Wuming smiled slightly. “I need not feel jealous. As long as I kill you, everything of yours will belong to me.”

“Making empty boasts again!” Ling Han shook his head. “Ji Wuming, how many times have we exchanged blows by now? And just how many times have you said you would kill me? And what was the result? Aren’t I still alive and kicking here?

“This time… it is me who will kill you!”

With a roar, Ling Han took the initiative to move. He launched a furious punch, and?xiu, xiu, xiu, endless streaks of Sword Qi surged out. He used the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords.

“You are but a mere Dividing Soul Tier!” Ji Wuming said disdainfully, brandishing the sword in his right hand in a quick dance, while his left hand sent out a palm strike. The palm of his hand had become an inky darkness, as if it had condensed innumerable dimensions, such that even the air was folding on itself.

Boom, he pushed out his palm, and this inky darkness spread out, turning into a frightening force.

Ling Han felt his chest become muffled, and almost suffocated.

What a frightening attack. This Ji Wuming was really too strong. Every slight movement from him could release a celestial technique, and it was a high-level celestial technique at that.

He had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King previously, and who knew how many epochs he had plateaued for at this cultivation level, so the celestial techniques he had grasped had to be terrifying in number.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and multiple seals of great dao appeared around him. His battle cry did not cease as he waved his fists in a continuous barrage of assault.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

As Ling Han’s strength rapidly increased, the normal battle prowess of the two of them had finally reached a state of balance, but Ji Wuming was superior as he had really grasped too many celestial techniques, and was more proficient and meticulous in his use of Regulations as well. In the slightest moment of carelessness, Ling Han could possibly sustain a painful attack.

“Come!” Yet Ling Han took the initiative to attack. With a tremor of his figure, the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul was summoned out.

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul also released a battle cry, and wielding the Divine Demon Sword, it joined forces with Ling Han, launching a combined offensive towards Ji Wuming.
