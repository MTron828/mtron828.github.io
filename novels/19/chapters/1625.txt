Chapter 1626: Strategy

The Empress walked beside the Star Sand Saint.

Pa!

She raised her slender hand and pushed the Great Saint aside.

She was far too powerful right now, and the Star Sand Saint was already no match for her.

However, Zhong Ye merely thought that the Star Sand Saint had gone weak in the knees upon seeing such a stunning beauty. He couldn’t help but chuckle coldly. ‘Are you bringing yourself to me? No worries. Then I’ll take you away as well after I suppress you!’

If Small Saints wanted to flee, Medium Saints most likely wouldn’t be able to catch up to them. However, if a Small Saint insisted on fighting, would a Medium Saint not be able to suppress and capture them?

“You dare to slander my husband?” the Empress asked with a haughty expression. “Who do you think you are?!”

The Empress was far too beautiful and charming, so much so that even her expression of anger was attractive and mesmerizing. Although Zhong Ye was being pointed at and scolded, he couldn’t bring himself to feel angry at all. Instead, he felt an urge to kneel down and lick the Empress’ toes.

However, he immediately shuddered as this thought flashed across his mind. He was a Saint, so how could his will be shaken so easily?

The beauty of this woman was far too astonishing.

He didn’t answer her question. Instead, he ferociously lashed out with a palm, aiming to capture the Empress.

“Impudence!” the Empress shouted softly as she also replied with a palm strike of her own.

Boom!

A burst of sword light erupted from her slender hand and soared into the sky.

Pu!

Zhong Ye was instantly sliced into two halves, from his left shoulder all the way down to his right side’s ribs. Blood spurted into the air like a fountain as his upper body slowly slid away from his lower body. There was a look of astonishment on his face, and it was clear that he still hadn’t comprehended what had just happened.

‘How is she so powerful?!’

He was a Medium Saint, yet he couldn’t even withstand a single strike of hers?

He hurriedly channeled his Origin Power and life force to stabilize the two halves of his body and contain his vitality. However, the Empress’ sword strike contained a devastating destructive ability that continued to erase his vitality even as he attempted to resist it by combusting his life force.

Zhong Ye was absolutely petrified. If he had been a normal person, he would have definitely died after being cut into two. However, this was no big deal for Saints. They could fully recover from such wounds in no time as long as they could reattach their body and channel Origin Power for a while.

However, what was occurring right now was completely beyond his expectations. There was a frightening murderous aura surging through his body, and this aura possessed a destructive ability that far surpassed his ability to recover. If this continued, both his body and soul would be completely destroyed.

Zhong Ye was overcome by horror. At the same time, his feeling of superiority as a member of the Forbidden Lands also vanished without a trace. His divine sense hurriedly left his body. He couldn’t remain in his body any longer. If he did, even his divine sense would be obliterated alongside his body. However, as long his divine sense survived, he could possess another being and live on.

When his divine sense left his body, however, he saw the stunningly beautiful Empress who had aroused his lust stare at him with a murderous expression. She swung her slender hand again. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Pa!

His divine sense was mercilessly destroyed. Blood rain instantly started to pour from the sky as heaven and earth expressed their grief at the death of a Saint.

He had died an unfortunate death.

If a Saint wanted to flee, they would have a huge chance of succeeding. However, who told him to underestimate the Empress so greatly? Not only that, but he had even dared to think about capturing the Empress and taking her as his concubine. Thus, he naturally had to suffer the consequences of his foolish actions.

The Star Sand Saint and the others all wore strange expressions. Sure enough, birds of a feather flocked together. Ling Han had killed Saints in the past, and now it was the Empress’ turn to kill Saints. It was as if Saints were nothing more than trash in their eyes.

Anyhow, the Empress’ resoluteness in killing Zhong Ye signified that she still had trump cards to rely on. That was, Ling Han could unleash his might and obtain the ability to kill Saint Kings again. Heh, then they had nothing to worry about.

There was a smile on Ling Han’s face, yet he was actually baring his teeth in his mind. The next person to visit would definitely be the Open Clouds King. However, he didn’t have any more power boosts from the Black Tower. How would he deal with the Open Clouds King?

Fortunately, even if there were threads of fate here that allowed the Open Clouds King to immediately learn of Zhong Ye’s death, it would still take him a long time to arrive. After all, even Zhong Ye had taken four to five years to get here. This suggested that the Open Clouds Forbidden Land was extremely far away from here.

He still had four to five years to spare.

“Hmm?” Ling Han rubbed his chin in thought. If he were to seek help from the Saint Kings of the other Forbidden Lands, he would essentially be admitting that he didn’t have any more trump cards that enabled him to kill Saint Kings. Some Forbidden Lands wouldn’t change their attitude, but other ones... Heh...

‘Actually, I can do this. I’ll host another treasure exchange meeting in four years’ time and invite all of those Saint Kings over. In fact, I can use discussing dao as a reason to keep them there for a good eight to 10 years. If the Open Clouds King comes at that time, those Saint Kings will naturally step forward to defend me.

‘Nice, I’ll do just that!’

There were many descendants of the Forbidden Lands in the martial arts academy, and Ling Han could easily send his invitations through them. He would invite the Saint Kings to gather on Wood Figure Planet in four years’ time.

Meanwhile, Ling Han also started to earnestly cultivate.

After all, inviting those Saint Kings over was only to hold down the fort. However, the only thing that he could truly rely on was his own strength.

Becoming a Saint King in four years was obviously not possible. However, reaching the Saint Tier most likely wouldn’t pose any challenges. The Empress was a good example of this. As long as he reached the Saint Tier, his strength would definitely rise explosively. At that time, rivaling Great Saints wouldn’t be difficult.

Even if he couldn’t defeat the Open Clouds King, he would still at least be able to flee. Moreover, the Open Clouds King wouldn’t dare to touch the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. Otherwise, the Open Clouds Forbidden Land would also suffer great losses if Ling Han decided to frenziedly exact revenge on them. Of course, that was unless the members of the Zhong Clan all decided to never leave their Forbidden Land, and the Open Clouds King also stood guard there forever.

After reaching a certain level, one would also need to abide by certain rules. One shouldn’t sweep the families of others into their conflicts.

Ling Han’s invitations and the news of Zhong Ye’s death started to arrive at the numerous Forbidden Lands. Apart from sighing in emotion at Ling Han’s explosive temper, the Saint Kings also became more certain that he still possessed a trump card that allowed him to obtain the power of Saint Kings. Otherwise, how would he dare to kill Zhong Ye?

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others were all diligently cultivating in the Black Tower. Their cultivation and strength were all rising rapidly. In reality, they could open the gates to the Celestial Realm once the Empress became a Great Saint. A countdown had already started to the day that they could finally enter the Celestial Realm.

A year and a half passed, and Ling Han had already formed 8,000,000 heavenly bodies. Three years later, his amount of heavenly bodies numbered 9.99999 million. Like with the Empress, his rapid speed of advance finally came to a stop at this moment. He had come across a genuine barrier.

At this moment, he didn’t even have time to make love with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden anymore. He spent all his time comprehending dao under the Reincarnation Tree. However, he was forcefully dragged away by the Empress and reverse dominated again.

He could cultivate, but he couldn’t forget to “feed” his wives.

This time, Ling Han cultivated in seclusion for an entire six months. Only then did he form his final heavenly body.

10,000,000 heavenly bodies—the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier!

He went into seclusion again. Half a year flashed by, and the elites of the numerous Forbidden Lands had already started to gradually arrive. They had received Ling Han’s invitation, and were here to attend the treasure exchange and dao discussion gathering.

Ling Han concluded his seclusion. He was already on the doorstep of the Genesis Tier, and he was confident that he could advance to this level not long in the future.

He called the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire over, and asked him to impart dao to the Saint Kings to buy some time. This was because the Open Clouds King could theoretically arrive at any time. He might arrive now, or he might arrive in one year, or even 10 years.

However, he believed that it wouldn’t be too long. After all, two Saints had been killed, so how could he endure this provocation?

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire ascended the stage, and this naturally stunned all of the Saint Kings. This child under 10 was going to lecture them on dao? However, they immediately discovered that this child was actually a Saint—a Medium Saint at that!

When the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire started to speak, the Saint Kings instantly started to listen to him with respect.

Each word was a gem, and each phrase was intricately linked with dao.
