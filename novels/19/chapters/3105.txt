3106 Old Sun

As expected, these monkeys really understood.

A baboon walked forward. After taking a few steps, it turned around and saw that Ling Han had not moved, so it waved its left arm at him, as if signaling him to follow.

Ling Han understood. It was probably taking him directly to the Precious Tree.

Alright, now he could go and pick the fruits himself. He didn’t have to ask the monkeys for it.

They traversed mountains and ridges, The monkeys moved nimbly: they climbed walls and trees if there were no paths ahead, but Ling Han was different. He was only slightly stronger than an ordinary person now. Going through such high-intensity exercises, he was soon panting heavily.

He could only ask to stop and rest several times before they finally arrived at a valley.

This valley was very hidden, mainly because the path was too difficult to travel on. Oh, that wasn’t right—there wasn’t any path at all. 70% of the journey required them to climb over rocky terrain and trees to pass through.

This was clearly the nest of the monkeys. There were over 100 monkeys in the valley, and when they saw Ling Han coming over, they all jumped over, squeaking as they grabbed onto tree branches and swayed about, appearing to have gone wild.

Ling Han, on the other hand, smiled and tried his best to appear amiable. Had these monkeys been feeding on those Precious Fruits, they would probably have been very strong. If he was to anger them, it really wouldn’t be a joking matter if over 100 of them rushed up against him.

If he, a former ultimate elite and unparalleled prodigy, was to die under the chaotic punches of these monkeys, then his reputation would truly be tarnished for tens of thousands of years.

There was a fruit tree at the bottom of the valley, and it was only eight meters tall. In the current environment, this height was really nothing out of the ordinary. However, Ling Han’s attention was focused upon the fruits growing on the tree.

They were all the same as the ones he had eaten before, but most of them hadn’t matured. They weren’t even the size of a fist, and they hadn’t turned completely red.

There were only a dozen or so that could be harvested, and they were all at the top of the tree.

Ling Han instantly wanted to climb the tree to pick the fruits. He walked to the bottom of the tree, and just as he was about to start climbing, he suddenly felt his feet slip. Pa, he fell down solidly.

“Zhi, zhi, zhi!” The monkeys were instantly amused, and all of them grinned widely and laughed.

‘F*ck, I was actually mocked by a group of monkeys.’

Ling Han patted off his behind and stood up. He was also a little puzzled. Why did he suddenly fall?

The ground here wasn’t very slippery.

He stayed vigilant and went to climb the tree again. Pa, he slipped again and fell hard for the second time.

“Zhi!” The monkeys were easily amused, and the entire group instantly erupted into laughter .

Something wasn’t right. There had to be some sort of trick.

Ling Han climbed to his feet. He couldn’t have fallen for no reason. Someone had to be playing a prank on him.

‘Yi, it ought to be the monkeys.’

He sized up the monkeys, but every one of them was quite a distance away from him. He really didn’t believe that they could affect him by making a move from afar.

‘So what’s going on?’

Ling Han became even more careful, and further slowed down his movements. Pa, he suddenly made a move, and directly hugged the tree trunk.

‘Let’s see how you’re going to cause trouble now.’

Ling Han climbed up the tree, but he had only climbed less than half a meter when he felt his hands suddenly go limp. Pa, he instantly slipped from the tree, and fell to the ground.

“Zhi! Zhi!” The monkeys were amused again.

F*ck! F*ck!

Ling Han felt depressed, like a tiger that had fallen from grace and was being bullied by a dog. In the past, he had been incredibly powerful and impressive, but now he had actually been treated as a joke by a bunch of monkeys.

He felt stifled.

“Hahaha, hahahaha!” A burst of laughter rang out. The sound of laughter couldn’t be suppressed by the squealing of the monkeys.

Huh?!

Ling Han was stunned. Monkeys only knew how to squeal, and couldn’t speak. Then who was laughing?

It had to be a human! There was a human here!

It had to be this person who had interfered.

However, this person probably didn’t have any malicious intent. Otherwise, given that he was able to exert force through the air, killing Ling Han would have been child’s play for him.

“Senior, may I pay my respects?” Ling Han stood up and bowed in all directions.

“Brat, do you really want to see Old Sun?” a voice asked.

This person’s surname was Sun?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Of course.”

“Alright, then come and find Old Sun,” the voice said slyly.

Ling Han first looked up at the tree, but did not discover anything. He then expanded his range of search, but still did not discover anyone.

They were surrounded by valley walls, and there were no caves. Where could a person hide?

Eh? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He finally realized that there was a spot that was different. It was covered with a pile of huge fan-like leaves, as if something was hidden within it.

Ling Han walked over, and asked, “Senior should be here, right?”

However, could such a small place really hide a person?

“At least you’re smart, brat.” That voice rang out again. Clearly Ling Han was standing right beside it, yet he was completely unable to detect that this voice was coming from the pile of leaves.

Elites were indeed unique.

Ling Han peeled off the leaves—one, two, and three leaves. The leaves were continuously being plucked away, and when there were only three leaves left, Ling Han took away another leaf, and couldn’t help but reveal an expression of disbelief on his face.

Under the pile of leaves was not a person, but a head, a monkey’s head!

Ling Han felt a little dizzy. Was it a monkey talking to him just now? Was it also a monkey toying with him?

He looked again and saw that the monkey’s body was completely inside the mountain, with only its head sticking out.

It definitely didn’t enter the spot by itself, because the hole at its neck was too small to allow its body to come out, and its head couldn’t possibly retract into it. There might be some kind of tunnel at the other end.

This monkey seemed to be bound to this mountain.

“Insolence!” The monkey bared its teeth with a fierce expression. “Brat, why aren’t you kneeling when you see Old Sun?”

It really was this monkey speaking.

Ling Han was astonished. More than 100 years ago, the sky, seas, and stars had undergone a mutation, and a large number of ferocious beasts had gained intelligence and possessed great power. However, he had never heard of wild beasts being able to speak?

Could it be that the monkey was really a human’s brother from the primitive ages, so after the mutation, it could speak human language?

“Greetings, Senior.” Ling Han cupped his fists. He would not bow down to a monkey.

“Insignificant human. Back when Old Sun’s might shook the world, countless human prodigies wanted to follow Old Sun, but Old Sun didn’t take a fancy to them at all. Now that I’ve given you a chance to bow before me, you actually don’t want to do so. You’re really infuriating Old Sun!” the monkey shouted loudly.

All around, the baboons were watching them from afar, seemingly in awe of this monkey.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. This monkey could even speak human language, and its level of evolution was indeed very high. It was no wonder that all the other monkeys revered it

“Senior, you seem to be suppressed here,” he said. He had experienced so much before, and seeing this scene now, it was obvious that this monkey had been suppressed.

Although only one head was revealed, its fur was golden, as if made of gold. It gave off a mighty and noble feeling; it definitely wasn’t an ordinary monkey.

The monkey was originally extremely furious, but upon hearing Ling Han’s words, its anger seemed to fade instantly, and it became dejected.

Ling Han had hit a sore spot.

“Humph, not even the heavens can be hidden from my eyes. How can this mountain suppress me forever?” The monkey immediately became full of confidence again. “In less than 10 years, I’ll definitely be able to escape!”
