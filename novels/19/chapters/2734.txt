2735 Seizing the alchemical pill

“The match will continue tomorrow,” said the Heavenly Venerate.

Everyone turned to look at Wu Haoyang, who was lying on the ground. Fortunately, this guy had been knocked unconscious, otherwise he would be making a lot of commotion right now.

Everyone dispersed. People like Ling Han and the others also needed to make proper adjustments to deal with the next day’s battle.

When he got back to his own abode, Rain Emperor and the others came over one after another.

!!

“Good job in eliminating Wu Haoyang.” The large black dog was very excited. “That guy is too arrogant. Unexpectedly, our Little Han is not weak, either, and can actually hurt his body!”

“Everyone has a weakness indeed.” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable nodded with a smile.

If there hadn’t been a Ling Han, then Wu Haoyang would have been absolutely invincible. However, Ling Han could actually restrain him. Conversely, although Ling Han’s physique was like Divine Metal, he wasn’t invincible in the face of Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess. As long as Tu Shi and the others joined forces, the chances of Ling Han being outmatched would likely be very high.

Wu Haoyang should have been extremely depressed. Why did the heavens allow one Ling Han to appear before him?

“At this point, Little Han should be able to secure the victory.” The large black dog smiled, and then instigated, “Little Han, are you going to follow Wu Haoyang’s example, and beat up all the remaining four people tomorrow so that you alone can get the Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pills?”

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable immediately shook his head. “Ling Han is not Wu Haoyang. It’s just that his body is like Divine Metal, and he is not invincible. If he exhibits such thoughts, he will definitely be targeted. With the joint efforts of the four elites, there is a high chance that he will be defeated.”

Tu Shi, Qi Changjun, Zhu Yan, and Tie Binghe—which one of them wasn’t a prodigy capable of leading their generation? Fighting one on one, Ling Han could be fearless, while fighting one on two would make it difficult for Ling Han to win, and he would be powerless to even fight back when fighting one on three.

The large black dog couldn’t help but feel it was a pity. He had always been very greedy.

The day’s time passed by quickly, and the tournament continued.

Ling Han didn’t see Wu Haoyang, and he had no idea whether this guy hadn’t woken up yet or he felt ashamed, and couldn’t face other people.

Ling Han didn’t care; his immediate goal was to get his hands on the Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pill.

Upon entering the Heavenly Venerate Tool, the competition quickly continued.

Five people, fighting for four positions.

After a brief confrontation, a scuffle broke out immediately.

Ling Han wasn’t targeted, because he wasn’t as “invincible” as Wu Haoyang, and he wasn’t as aggressive as Wu Haoyang, so Tu Shi and the others were quite well behaved.

After a day of battles, Tu Shi became the second rookie to be eliminated.

He was wearing a very surly expression. In fact, it couldn’t be said that his strength wasn’t enough, but it was just that he was sent flying from the blows at that moment, and when he came running back, the sand in the hourglass had run out.

Just like with Wu Haoyang the day before yesterday, it wasn’t a matter of strength, but rather it was more a matter of luck.

At present, there were still four people remaining. As long as one more got eliminated, this game would be over.

Who would be the one?

After resting for one day, the competition continued for the final day.

After fighting with each other for a while, the four elites were divided into two groups fighting fierce battles—Ling Han was clashing with Qi Changjun, while Zhu Yan was facing Tie Binghe.

As long as one person among them got defeated, the remaining three would emerge victorious.

However, with their abilities, there wouldn’t be any problem to use a Heavenly Venerate Technique for a day. In their current state, they were practically unparalleled in battle prowess, and no one could actually suppress the other.

Hence, the day was almost over, yet the four of them were still engaged in a fierce battle.

There was only slightly more than a dozen grains of sand left in the hourglass.

The four of them were no longer trying to defeat their opponent, but were targeting the chairs as they kept on attacking.

Nine grains of sand.

Peng, peng, peng, the four people were attacking one another. It was no longer a fierce two-on-two battle, but a four-person battle royale. Anyone whose battle prowess was slightly inferior would be sent flying, and he would naturally be eliminated.

It had already come to this point; who would want to fall at the last moment?

The four of them continued attacking with their ultimate moves, and they absolutely didn’t care who it was, but as long as one person among them was sent flying, that would do.

Seven grains, five grains, and then three grains of sand!

When there was only one grain of sand left, all of them roared, and blasted out with their respective ultimate moves using all their strength.

Peng, a terrifying wave surged, and a figure was finally blown away, while the remaining three immediately seized their seats.

The last grain of sand had fallen, and the game was over.

In a flash of light, someone had been kicked out.

It was Tie Binghe.

In other words, the final winners were… Ling Han, Zhu Yan, and Qi Changjun.

Shua, shua, shua, the three of them also came out of the Heavenly Venerate Tool after a while.

“Very good, very good.” That Heavenly Venerate nodded with a smile. “Congratulations to you for fighting your way out. This is your reward. Hopefully, you will be able to kill even more of Hysteria’s army.”

He took out a pill bottle, and handed it over to Ling Han first.

Ling Han took it, and said, “Thank you, My Lord.”

That Heavenly Venerate smiled in response. He didn’t dare to put on airs in front of Ling Han, as it might not take long for the other party to catch up and be on par with him in terms of battle prowess, and then to catch up to him in terms of cultivation level. Perhaps in another billion years, it would conversely be his turn to address the other party as “lord.”

Hence, now would be the time to create a good relationship.

Why was Ling Han the first to be given the reward? Of course, careful considerations had been made.

The second person to receive the reward was Zhu Yan.

“We will never forget the sacrifice that Senior Zhu has made for the Genesis World,” that Heavenly Venerate said in a deep voice.

Zhu Yan looked solemn as she took the pill bottle. “I definitely won’t bring disgrace upon my ancestors!”

The third one was of course Qi Changjun; that Heavenly Venerate stretched out his hand, and handed over the pill bottle.

Shua!

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly flashed past at an astonishing speed.

Who would have thought that someone would launch a sneak attack at this moment!

Nevertheless, that Heavenly Venerate was the one who reacted the fastest—he stretched his hand and released a palm strike in the direction of the light. However, when the palm strike reached the light, it continued to sweep out without causing effect

Wu Haoyang.

Upon seeing this scene, everyone pronounced this name in their hearts.

Sure enough, the flash of light transformed into the appearance of Wu Haoyang. He stretched out his hand, and grabbed the pill bottle in the hand of that Heavenly Venerate.

Gasp, this guy actually wanted to snatch the Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pill.

Everyone was numb with shock. This guy was indeed too audacious; he even dared to seize something from the hands of a Heavenly Venerate. Moreover, this was the Realm Battlefield, and those who disobeyed the law… would be killed immediately! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was just that this was too unexpected, and no one had been on guard. After Wu Haoyang flashed past that Heavenly Venerate in one move, he had already succeeded in 90 percent. When he once again swung his hand in a grabbing motion, the last1 pill bottle fell into his hand.

Still not satisfied, he then made a grab for Zhu Yan, intending to snatch another treasure pill.

“Humph!” Ling Han made a move, and threw a punch out.

“I’ll fight you again once I become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” Wu Haoyang let out a long roar, turned around, and left without any intention to fight.

“Stop running!!” That Heavenly Venerate became angry, and quickly followed to give chase. If Wu Haoyang succeeded in running away, the former would absolutely be put to shame.

“My alchemical pill!” Qi Changjun also became furious, and chased after Wu Haoyang.

It was just that Wu Haoyang’s speed was obviously above theirs, or in other words, his physique was really too freakish, so as long as he was careful not to be hit by a Heavenly Venerate Tool, he would be invincible here—except when going against Ling Han.

After a while, that Heavenly Venerate and Qi Changjun came back, and their faces were livid.

This matter wouldn’t end so easily. This time Wu Haoyang was indeed too outrageous, so that Heavenly Venerate immediately reported to the higher authorities, requesting for the cooperation of the Wu Clan to capture Wu Haoyang and bring him here to face punishment.
