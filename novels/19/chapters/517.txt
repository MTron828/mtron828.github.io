Chapter 518: Strange Mineshaft

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han sighed and said, “Tell me, who you guys tried to assassinate and failed again, provoking others to hunt you guys down?”

“Huh, how did you know we’re assassins?” the younger sister said, surprised.

“You guys still haven’t recognized my voice?” Ling Han was speechless. Were these sisters even fit to be called assassins?

The younger sister hurriedly lit up the oil lamp, swaying it before Ling Han’s face, and couldn’t help but shout “mommy” as she pointed at Ling Han. She said, “It’s you! Why are you here? I’ve seen a ghost!”

These assassin sisters were obviously Liu Feng Er and Liu Ru Er, who failed to assassinate Xu Ke Xin and left with Yun Shuang Shuang. Thinking about it now, they were certainly from the Fire Country. But, it was just too coincidental, bumping into them in a country so big.

Ling Han laughed and said, “No need to care about why I’m here, how do we take care of your matter?”

“We have to trouble Young Master Han again to hide us sisters,” Liu Feng Er said with a smile. This youngster was so calm and collected, completely unlike a teen, making her feel an indescribable sense of safety.

“Tsk, we don’t even know whom you offended and ran to such a remote town for refuge yet you still want to protect us?” Liu Ru Er was as before—uncomfortable without saying a few provoking words. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ling Han curled his lip and said, “Well, I’m truly sorry, please go wherever you came from.”

“Cheap, I was just saying. Do you really have to be so serious?” Liu Ru Er pouted.

“Seriously, whom did you guys offend this time?” Ling Han sighed.

Liu Ru Er instantly looked self-satisfied, and said, “We tried to assassinate Fire Country’s significant minister, Na Zhi Yan!”

“W-w-what, what sort of weird name is that?” Ling Han interjected.

“Na Zhi Yan, a dirty man actually named such a sissy name.” Liu Ru Er seemed to have found mutual understanding with him, her face filled with approval. “That’s right, like I said, this person’s name is terrible 1 .”

Liu Feng Er was speechless, and said, “The name doesn’t matter, the key is that Na Zhi Yan suddenly appeared in the recent half a year and became Fire Emperor’s most highly regarded. He bewitched Fire Emperor to mine an extremely strange mineshaft. Every time the workers returned from mining, they’d die suddenly on the second day.

“However, Fire Emperor didn’t give up, and assembled manpower from all over the country, excavating that mineshaft. Whoever dared to disobey would be killed; now, countless people in the country are frightened, so we’re killing Na Zhi Yan to exterminate an evil for the country!”

“Tsk, being assassins, you still get a feeling of nobility?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Don’t you look down on us. We do have three no-kills!” Liu Ru Er said proudly. “Don’t kill kids, don’t kill the old, and don’t kill those who do good.”

Ling Han nodded as he smiled, and said, “And then what, you guys tried to assassinate Na Zhi Yan and ended up failing and being chased for a ten thousand miles?”

Liu Ru Er pouted, and said, “Can’t you estimate us a bit grander? Like, after we successfully assassinated him, then successfully broke away from the chasing soldiers?”

“Hehe.”

“What does hehe mean?” Liu Ru Er stuck her hands on her hips and appeared extremely discontent.

Hong!

A heavy sound came from the outside—a house was probably torn down. That voice from earlier sounded again. “The Imperial Guard’s handling affairs, we can react first and report later. If everyone in this town isn’t at the town’s east gate in fifteen minutes, the rest will be killed!”

Ling Han nodded and said, “Looks like Na Zhi Yan certainly is quite spoiled. An assassination attempt was made on him and he actually sortied the Imperial Guard to chase the culprit.”

“Heng, heng, there are seven high level Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors chasing us. Thankfully we were quick-witted, running away quickly!” Liu Ru Er said proudly.

“Young Master Han!” Zhu Wu Jiu’s voice sounded from outside the door.

Ling Han pondered, and said, “Dismiss and suitably teach those people a lesson, but no need to kill.”

“Yes!” Zhu Wu Jiu accepted the orders and left. He was now at the third layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier and refined the Heavenly Luck Stone. His battle prowess rocketed to eleven stars, and he definitely belonged to the elite in the Fire Country.

Ling Han, however, sighed. With this disturbance, looks like the Ling Family had to move again.

These sisters truly caused nothing but trouble for him!

“Hey, hey, hey, your little attendant can settle those Imperial Guards outside? Those are high level Spiritual Ocean Tier warriors!” Liu Ru Er said in disbelief.

“Don’t make a fuss.” Ling Han pressed his hand in gesture and said thoughtlessly, “How’s Yun Shuang Shuang?”

“Unbelievably good. She’s a famous entertainer in the Imperial City; everyone is honored to listen to Lady Shuang Shuang play a piece of music. Countless people want to marry her!” Liu Ru Er said and looked wickedly at Ling Han, hoping to see a disappointed expression.

How could Ling Han possibly care about Yun Shuang Shuang? He only recalled her after seeing these sisters and so asked thoughtlessly.

In a short while, Zhu Wu Jiu returned and spoke by the door, “Young Master Han, the matter’s taken care of. Are there any other commands?”

Ling Han nodded and said, “Go rest.”

“Yes!” Only then did Zhu Wu Jiu leave.

The sisters’ expressions were filled with shock. After a while, Liu Ru Er finally said, “Hey, hey, hey, is your attendant bullsh*tting?”

Ling Han shrugged and said, “Can you still hear the dogs bark?”

Liu Ru Er was first startled, then finally reacted to Ling Han calling the Imperial Guards as dogs, giggling involuntarily, but immediately covered her small mouth with her hands, and said, “I really can’t hear them anymore!”

Liu Feng Er’s expression was also filled with shock. “Young Master Han, those are high level Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivators!”

Ling Han laughed loudly and said, “The trouble’s taken care of, you guys can leave now. May we never meet again. Sigh, encountering you guys is never a good thing.”

“Pah, we aren’t bearers of bad luck!” Liu Ru Er’s expression was full of annoyance, but immediately continued, “Since your attendant is so impressive, why not lend him to us for a few days and help us kill that Na Zhi Yan!”

Ling Han sneered and said, “You have the nerve to say such a thing? Being an assassin to your degree, that’s truly embarrassing!”

“Tsk, we’re exterminating evil for the people!” Liu Ru Er grabbed onto Ling Han and said, “Since you’re now in the Fire Country, and bumped into us as luck would have it, it means heavens ordained so! You need to give it effort.”

Ling Han declined to comment, but it couldn’t be denied that this matter was too coincidental. Of all the places the sisters could run, they ran into his place of seclusion.

He stroked his chin; if Fire Emperor was bent on having his way, then no matter where the Ling Family moved, they might suffer the Imperial Family’s coercion to go dig those ores.

Unless they left the Fire Country.

However, what exactly were those mines that would make Fire Emperor act so crazily, personally destroying the basis of this country?

Ling Han asked, “Do you guys know what mineshaft that is?”

“We don’t know. We only know that strange ores can be dug out every day and sent to the Imperial Family.” Liu Feng Er shook her head.

A shred of curiosity welled up in Ling Han.
