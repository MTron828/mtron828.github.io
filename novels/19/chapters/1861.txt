Chapter 1862: Watch your feet

Though this was shameless, it was also making reasonable use of the tournament regulations.

No one had made it a rule that over a dozen people could not work together, after all, right?

The young man in black was immensely pleased with himself. He had already made up his mind. This time, he would win with an advantage in numbers, and he would clear the path with money next, bombarding his opponents with enough money that they would admit defeat. No matter what, he would have to obtain a place to enter into the fourth level.

After that, there was no need for him to think about it. But being able to stand on the stage of the fourth level, he would have naturally gotten enough of the limelight.

He had the money, and could be as willful as he liked!

There was a total of over 100 people in this small set, and now over a dozen people were a single team. This kind of force was really very strong.

“Let’s get rid of them first!” A voice rang out.

When everyone heard this, they realized something. Indeed, though the other side had over a dozen people, what about them? There were more or less 100 of them. How could it be that 100 of them were still unable to defeat over a dozen people?

“Attack!”

These people all rushed forth, and began to gang up on the black-robed young man’s group.

The young man in black was dumbfounded; he had never imagined that this would have been the result.

There were over 100 people; how was over a dozen of them supposed to hold them back?

When the spectators saw this, they couldn’t help but feel amused.

It was very rare to see this kind of scene. One side was clearly at an advantage, but the circumstances were reversed in an instant.

That was why it was said that a person had to be humble. Just see, if you showed off too much, this would be the consequences.

If the young man in black knew how to use strategy, or, in fact, as long as he had not so arrogantly yelled out his declaration, and instead directly swept aside all opposition the moment the battle started, he would have been able to instantly clear the stage with the combined forces of over a dozen people.

But now? He was going to be beaten to crap.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Amidst a chaotic battle, the young man in black and his more than dozen companions were all instantly crippled. Their only advantage lay in numbers, and they did not have any elite that was particularly outstanding and could reverse the desperate crisis; how could they hold up against being ganged up on like this?

The young man in black was beaten to the ground, and who knew how many people planted footprints on his body. He forcefully raised his head, and found the direction where the voice had first sounded from. He saw that a young man was presently smiling at him there.

He immediately became furious. ‘This guy must have done it on purpose!

‘Just you wait, I will remember this!’

Meanwhile, Ling Han sighed. Actually, he had only wanted to silently play the role of a handsome man, but who asked everyone to be arranged in the same set. Even if he had not yelled, in the end, he would still have had to personally deal with him.

In that case, it was better to stoke the flames, and watch a show.

Ling Han waved a hand with a smile, and said, “Have a safe journey.”

Peng, the young man in black was thrown out of the battle ring, and according to the rules, he was disqualified from the tournament.

The young man in black got back to his feet unsteadily, his face covered in bruises. He resolutely said, “We are now enemies! No one can screw me, Shantian Wu, over like this!”

Ling Han frowned. For some reason, he very much disliked this kind of surname. If he had known that the other had this kind of detestable surname, he definitely would not have just allowed him to flee so easily. He would have thrashed him over and over again.

Never mind; the other clearly had no plans to give up the matter. Then, Ling Han would still have the chance to thrash him in future. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Shantian Wu and his group all left, the over 100 people that remained all cheered. Some even hugged one another, appearing to be completely at peace with each other. Others would definitely not believe that they were actually competitors.

“Ah, you are very despicable, actually stabbing me!” one person suddenly screamed. That was because he had just hugged another, and in the end, the latter stabbed a cold sword into his waist. Thankfully, a Severing Mundane Tier was too strong. This would only cause him severe injury, but not fatality.

“My bottom!” Another person had just been kicked out of the ring of battle, exclaiming in pain as he held his behind.

What had initially been a state of peace now immediately became a state of mutual hostility. It was very comical.

The spectators that were watching all laughed loudly, and felt that this set battling was really too cheery. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, meanwhile, smiled bitterly. As long as her husband was there, it seemed that whatever serious matter would immediately become a comical farce.

Ling Han scratched his head. He really hadn’t done anything; he had only given a holler.

“Pretty boy, get out of here!” A middle-aged man brandished his saber and delivered a slash. Everyone was in the Severing Mundane Tier here, yet they were all engaging in a battle royale in a limited space. Actually, merely the shock waves that resulted from the battles were enough to cause great damage.

This man had a strong physique. Under the shock waves of the battle, his skin was exuding a light silvery shimmer, as if he had turned into a silver god of war that held power that could destroy the heavens and rend the earth, and he swept towards Ling Han.

“Watch your feet,” Ling Han said with a grin.

‘What?!’

The middle-aged man faltered slightly. ‘My saber is already close to striking you, and you actually tell me to watch my feet. What is the meaning of that? Has your brain been kicked by a mule, brat?’

He thought so, but the saber in his hand did not pause in its course at all, and continued on its way to strike Ling Han’s head.

Just when it looked like the saber’s blade was about to strike Ling Han’s neck, he involuntarily showed an expression of joy. He was definitely going to land this hit.

But just at this moment, he saw Ling Han raise his hand, and he did not see the latter make any big move, but the saber which he had waved out suddenly took a sharp turn, and descended directly with a light wave of Ling Han, striking the ground instead.

Coincidentally, he just happened to be charging out, his left foot slightly behind. This strike had landed on the instep of his left foot.

“Ah...!” the middle aged man screamed out immediately. He had put a lot of force in this strike, instilling all the power of Regulations he had. With this strike, his whole foot had been sliced in half. Pu, blood sprayed out in all directions.

Watch your feet, so that was what he meant.

He looked dumbly at Ling Han. How could there be anything so coincidental in this world? Just a casual word from Ling Han, and that just happened to be the result.

The latter’s strength... had to be strong to a heaven-defying extent, and that was why he had a grasp of the whole situation, so everything would go as he wished.

The middle aged man was covered in cold sweat. Thankfully, the other party had only let this strike land on his foot, and not on his d*ck. He had already been merciful.

“Many thanks!” Leaving behind these words, he hurriedly ran out of the battle ring.

In the spectators’ seats, everyone was both curious and amused. How could there be someone like that? He had just been aggressively brandishing his saber in a strike, yet the result was this attack had landed on his own foot. Then, he turned to thank his opponent. This was practically inexplicable.

“Hehe, this is because that young man is very strong. Thus, that saber wielder had struck the instep of his own foot, yet still had to thank him for not killing him,” a young man explained. Though he said that Ling Han was very strong, his face bore an expression of arrogance.

“Yi, the prodigy of the Cheng Clan, Cheng Fengyun!”

“He is an incredible character; it is said that he is just a step away from becoming a king tier.”

“Since he said that that young man is very strong, he must be very strong indeed!”

Those around him all talked spiritedly. Some even bravely asked, “Young Master Cheng, why are you not participating? Also, if you were matched up against that young man, what do you think of your chances of victory?”

Cheng Fengyun’s expression was filled with pride as he declared, “100%!”

Ling Han was very powerful, but as he saw it, he was nothing more than this. As for why he did not participate? You had to be joking. This time, even Zhao Qingfeng had come, and he had caused three Holy Sons and Holy Daughter to leave dejectedly through a single battle. Just what kind of strength was that?

No matter who participated, they would all be trampled over by Zhao Qingfeng. In that case, why should he seek his own humiliation?

He was already very well known, and did not need to make use of this kind of tournament to increase his own reputation.

“Young Master Cheng, as you see it, would this young man be able to emerge victorious from this set?” another person asked.

Cheng Fengyun gave it some thought, shook his head, and said, “Impossible! By now, he has already shown off his ability, and he would definitely be ganged up on by the others. Emerging victorious would be as difficult as ascending the heavens.”
