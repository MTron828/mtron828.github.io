Chapter 1177: Battling a Streak of Tigers

“Hehe!” A smug grin appeared on Meng Wei’s face, and she said, “I’ve practiced a peculiar cultivation technique, and it allows me to release a wisp of my divine sense. This divine sense can roam freely within a certain range, and it’s impossible for normal restrictions to stop it!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but take another glance at her. This cultivation technique seemed fairly useful. One could explore an unknown area without putting themself in any danger.

“Can you check out the current situation then?” he asked.

Meng Wei nodded and then closed her eyes. It was as if she had become a stone statue.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han could sense that something had exited Meng Wei’s body. It was invisible and shapeless, so one naturally couldn’t see or touch it. It could only be detected with one’s divine sense. However, one had to be extremely close if they wanted to detect it. If they were slightly further, they wouldn’t be able to detect anything.

After a long while, Meng Wei suddenly opened her eyes, and said, “Just as I expected. Those Demonic Beasts are still inside. I wounded the eyes of one of them, and I can still remember that battle extremely vividly.”

“What cultivation level are they at?” Ling Han asked.

“Most of them are at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, and only a few of them are still at the high extreme,” Meng Wei replied. She then patted Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “In the past, our only option would have been to run. However, now that you’re here... Go! Exterminate those Demonic Beasts!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Are you treating me as your underling?”

He would naturally be unafraid if the Demonic Beasts were only at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. However, he was afraid that there would be some at the Sun Moon Tier. If that were the case, his only option would be to flee.

However, there was potentially the inheritance of an alchemist here, so it was worth taking the risk.

Peng!

He launched a kick and sent the gate of the manor flying. Then, he immediately barged in.

He arrived in a garden, though this garden was already abandoned and derelict. Three Demonic Beasts were lying on the ground and resting. They looked like tigers, yet they all had a silver horn on their foreheads.

The three Demonic Beasts crawled up upon hearing the commotion.

“Another person has come!”

“Haha, we finally have something to eat!”

“The life essence of cultivators is extremely nutritious. Perhaps our cultivation level will go up if we eat a human.”

“That’s impossible! Unless... you eat a Sun Moon Tier human! However, they’ll be good for a snack. I haven’t eaten human flesh for so long. Oh, how I yearn for some!”

The three Demonic Beasts proceeded to chatter with each other. They had reached the Immortal level, so they could naturally communicate in human tongue. In fact, they could even shapeshift into human form if they wanted to.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I also yearn for some Demonic Beast meat. I haven’t tasted it in ages.”

“What a cocky human!”

“Kill him!”

The three Demonic Beasts roared loudly as they charged toward Ling Han.

These were three Demonic Beasts which were all at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, and their battle prowess was relatively astonishing. Moreover, Demonic Beasts had an inherent advantage over human cultivators, and it was normal for them to possess a battle prowess that was one star above their cultivation level.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

The three Demonic Beasts lunged over, and it was as if their large figures were blotting out heaven and earth.

Ling Han shook his head and casually extended a finger.

Pa, pa, pa!

Three streaks of sword light burst out, slicing the Demonic Beasts into two. They couldn’t be more dead.

Meng Wei and her group of mercenaries were already mentally prepared for this as they had seen Ling Han insta-kill the 24 villains who were at the consummate level before. However, they were still shocked upon seeing him dismember the three powerful Demonic Beasts with a single finger.

‘Heavens! Mountain River Tier cultivators can actually be this powerful!

‘As expected of a disciple from the Majestic Heaven Sect!’

Ling Han walked over and casually placed the corpses of the three Demonic Beasts into his Black Tower. The bodies of high-grade Demonic Beasts were full of treasures, and their Spiritual Meat was more so extremely nutritious. In fact, they were tremendously beneficial to cultivators who practiced Body Arts.

“Roar!”

More Demonic Beasts surged out from the manor, and upon discovering the pools of blood on the ground and realizing that their companions were missing, they all became wild with rage.

A horned tiger stepped forward, and said, “Human, where are our companions?”

“They wanted to eat me, yet they ended up being slaughtered by me,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

The Demonic Beasts instantly descended into chaotic rage. They all wanted to lunge over and bite Ling Han to death.

However, the horned tiger gave a low roar and stopped the other Demonic Beasts from charging over. It then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Human, there’s no animosity between us, so why did you come to our territory and kill our companions?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Even I feel a little embarrassed that you’re asking this question! This is human territory, so why are you Demonic Beasts occupying it? Even if we’re to hold an interrogation, I should be the one doing the interrogation! So, why on earth are you Demonic Beasts here?”

The horned tiger was at a loss for words. He had only asked that question to put mental pressure on Ling Han. Some humans were mentally weak, and their morale would drop when were questioned in such a manner.

In any case, he didn’t want to battle against these humans anyway. Their three companions had been disposed of so quickly, so it was clear that this human was extraordinarily powerful. It was best that they didn’t battle.

After reaching their cultivation level, these Demonic Beasts were already very similar to humans. They all strived for the dao of heaven and earth.

“Big Brother, why are you still speaking so much nonsense with him?” another horned tiger asked in disdain. “There are so many of us tigers, so do we really need to be afraid of a mere few humans?”

This mystery realm had already opened several times before this, and they had also eaten numerous humans. In their minds, human cultivators were the embodiment of weakness. Thus, they naturally wouldn’t respect or fear humans.

The leading horned tiger appeared especially hesitant. On the one hand, he didn’t dare to underestimate Ling Han and the others. On the other hand, however, his experiences and mindset led him to believe that it was impossible for humans to become overly powerful. His conflicting thoughts made him extremely indecisive.

“Die!” The horned tiger was still mulling over whether to attack or not, yet Meng Wei had already drawn her saber and charged toward them.

“Leader!” Her subordinates hurriedly followed her charge. If she were to become trapped among the horned tigers, she would definitely be ripped to shreds, even if she was at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

“Haha, it’s you!” one of the horned tigers said with a cold sneer. There was a scar on the corner of his eye; it had been left by Meng Wei 100 years ago. He had been filled with hate and thirst for vengeance for this entire time. Who would’ve thought that he would have the opportunity to exact revenge now?

He was the first horned tiger to lunge over. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The streak of tigers roared upon seeing this, and they all lunged toward Meng Wei and her companions.

The leading horned tiger had no option but to roar and charge over.

“Kill them! Kill them!” Hu Feiyun shouted as she hid behind Shui Yanyu’s back. She liked to spectate battles and excitement, yet she was especially afraid of death. Thus, she would naturally stay back to watch the commotion while egging others on to join the battle.

Ling Han shook his head, and it didn’t look like he would force her to join the battle.

The Rain Emperor and the others needed to improve through battles, yet Hu Feiyun’s situation was a bit unique. All she needed to do was raise her cultivation level. Empress Luan Xing’s willpower would slowly awaken as she did so, and it would guide her to reach an even higher cultivation level.

Thus, she didn’t need to participate in battles, as the existence of Empress Luan Xing’s willpower meant that she had already “experienced” this process.

Meanwhile, Shui Yanyu seemed very enthusiastic. She drew her sword and charged toward the horned tigers. She didn’t want to be a beauty who couldn’t help in battle—she also wanted to prove her abilities and worth.

Of course, she wasn’t stupid, either, and she chose the weakest member among the streak of tigers. This horned tiger possessed a similar cultivation level to her, and they immediately became locked in an intense battle.

The Asura Demon Emperor was responsible for protecting her. Although his battle prowess was only at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, such a battle prowess was almost saintly in this mystery realm. Thus, Ling Han was extremely at ease.

However, the Asura Demon Emperor didn’t dare to use his power wantonly, as it was possible that he would be targeted by the restrictions in this place.

With both Ling Han and the Asura Demon Emperor not participating in the battle, Meng Wei and the others were quickly plunged into a perilous situation.
