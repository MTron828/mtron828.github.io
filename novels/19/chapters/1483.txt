Chapter 1484 Scolding

How old was the Star Sand Saint?

Theoretically speaking, a Great Saint could live for three billion years. However, Saints would have to overcome an Immortal’s Calamity every 100 million years. If they couldn’t overcome this, they would have a portion of their lifespan severed. In fact, it was even possible that they might be directly killed. Even in the Celestial Realm—where one would possess an unlimited lifespan after reaching the Severing Mundane Tier—one would still be riddled with stubborn illnesses if they were unable to overcome their Immortal’s Calamity. Eventually, these elites would pass away.

Thus, it wasn’t certain that the Star Sand Saint could live for a full three billion years. Even if he could, he was already nearing that age anyway.

It was widely rumored that the Star Sand Saint was already approaching the end of his life. It was also because of this that he was urgently trying to find a successor to his inheritance. Although he had raised nine Saints, none of them were capable of truly inheriting his Dao.

The reason for this was simple. To say nothing of becoming a Great Saint, none of the nine Saints had even advanced to become a Medium Saint.

However, this old man who already had half his body inside a coffin had actually become the parent of a little boy of only four or five years old! This was astonishing!

Ling Han was fully aware of how difficult it was for powerful cultivators to conceive a child. He had made love with both Shui Yanyu and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden many times, yet he couldn’t get them pregnant no matter what. This was because the more powerful a cultivator became, the more condensed their essence would become. As a result, it would be extremely difficult for them to have children.

This was a backlash from heaven and earth. The more one absorbed from heaven and earth, the more powerful the backlash from heaven and earth would be.

Not to mention a Great Saint like the Star Sand Saint, it was already extremely difficult for even ordinary Saints to have children. Moreover, the Star Sand Saint was already nearing the end of his lifespan!

How impressive!

Ling Han was slightly stunned. This old bull was truly impressive. Not only was he still working hard, but his hard work had even produced a fruit. One could genuinely treat him as a role model.

Upon seeing the dazed expression on Ling Han’s face, the young man thought that he had frightened him. He sneered, and said, “Now that you’re aware of Young Master Yun’s identity, hurry up and kneel down to greet him!”

This young man was Mo Li, and he was a disciple of the seventh campus. He had been extremely fortunate, and he had won the opportunity to come to the Ancient Academy on a pilgrimage. In a stroke of coincidence, he had run across this little boy. After learning of his identity, he had tried everything in his abilities to grow closer to him. He eventually succeeded, and he was now the little boy’s playmate.

As long as he rode on this little boy’s coattails, he would naturally have some opportunity to eventually meet the Star Sand Saint. At that time, he would soar into the sky.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ve come here to cultivate, not to become someone’s slave! Children might be ignorant, but are you also this ignorant? If you dare to spew any more nonsense, I’m not afraid to beat you up!”

“You dare?!” Mo Li shouted. What an absolute joke. Young Master Yun was present, and even the nine Saints would have to respectfully refer to him as “little brother” if they were here. So, would an ordinary disciple like Ling Han dare to cause any trouble?

“I want to ride a horse! I want to ride a horse!” Meanwhile, the little boy continued to cause a ruckus. As he yelled, he also continued to kick Mo Li’s stomach.

Of course, this naturally couldn’t hurt a Heavenly Body Tier cultivator. However, Mo Li had to carefully control his Origin Power such that he wouldn’t accidentally counterattack on instinct after being “attacked” by the little boy. Otherwise, the little boy would be insta-killed by him.

If that were to happen, things would truly become chaotic.

Ling Han shook his head upon seeing this. With such a pathetic mindset, did this young man have any right to become an elite?

Since he had been able to enter the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, this young man was definitely a king tier. However, it was a shame that being a king tier in the past didn’t guarantee that one would remain a king tier forever. It was evident that he had already fallen. He wanted to take a shortcut, yet he didn’t realize that he had already lost what was most important to a cultivator.

Dignity and belief!

“Let’s go.” Ling Han wrapped his arm around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s waist as he turned around to leave. He had no time for this nonsense. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You’re trying to escape?!” Mo Li was enraged, and he instantly charged over and launched a punch at Ling Han’s back. Only when his fist was about to strike Ling Han’s back did he shout, “Eat my fist!”

Ling Han humphed as he reached backward in a clawing motion. He had acted later, yet his strike had arrived first. His hand wrapped around Mo Li’s neck.

Before an Eternal River Tier elite—especially a freakish rank three king tier like Ling Han—what threat could a Heavenly Body Tier cultivator pose? Upon entering the academy, Ling Han had already been powerful enough to rival elites at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Thus, if he were challenged by a Heavenly Body Tier cultivator, just how freakishly powerful would that Heavenly Body Tier cultivator have to be?

“You’re asking for a beating!” Ling Han’s right hand started to shudder as bursts of Origin Power coursed through it. At the same time, creaking and cracking sounds started to travel out from Mo Li’s body. This was the sound of his bones colliding against each other.

Mo Li didn’t possess a powerful physique, so Ling Han’s brutal attack caused at least half of his bones to break. He screamed in agony as his face instantly became twisted with pain.

However, he was quite stubborn, and he didn’t beg Ling Han to stop. Instead, he shouted, “You dared to wound me?! You actually dared to wound me?! Humph! Even a god can’t save you now! I’ll say that you tried to ambush and attack Young Master Yun! You’re dead meat!”

There was a menacing glint in his eyes as he stared at Ling Han. In this academy, no disciple dared to kill a fellow disciple. This was because they would have to pay with their own life. Thus, the power was now in Mo Li’s hands.

He had only become wounded because he was trying to protect Young Master Yun. Meanwhile, Ling Han had actually tried to assassinate Young Master Yun! His fate could only be death.

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. He slapped the young man’s face before saying, “Who would’ve thought that you actually had some brains. However, it’s a shame that you haven’t put your mind to the right task. Otherwise, you would’ve broken through to the Eternal River Tier long ago!”

Mo Li was slightly astonished. Why wasn’t Ling Han afraid? This wasn’t right!

In his mind, this was a deadly situation. Unless Ling Han begged him to change his mind, it was inevitable that he would be severely punished. Logically speaking, Ling Han should have been shuddering in fright. He should have immediately lowered his head to beg for his life. So, how was he still so calm and composed?

Perhaps he possessed a terrifying background that could rival the Star Sand Saint?

Impossible! If that were the case, why would he even come here?

Ling Han smiled as he pointed in the direction of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. He then said, “Look over there.”

Mo Li looked over, and he was instantly stunned by what he saw.

Young Master Yun was happily playing with that woman! Moreover, that woman hadn’t kneeled down to act like a horse or cow, either. Instead, she was simply carrying the little boy in her arms, a doting look on her face.

‘This... Something like this is possible?!’

Mo Li wanted to vomit blood. The plan that he had viewed as flawless was easily shattered just like that. Moreover, the person who had ruined his plan was none other than Young Master Yun, the little boy whom he had obsequiously played with for several months.

This was a painful realization!

“Be an upright and dignified person. Since you were able to enter the academy, you were definitely a king tier in the past. Why choose this kind of stray path?” Ling Han roared. His voice was like the thought-provoking evening drums and morning bell.

Mo Li fell deep into thought. How ambitious had he been in the past? However, he had suffered the “initiation” of being forced to crawl through a dog flap on the first day of entering the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. Afterward, he had put all of his effort into cultivating, resulting in his cultivation level rising rapidly.

However, the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was brimming with king tiers, and he had suffered several more brutal losses. This severely dented his self-confidence. As a result, he started to take stray and crooked paths, no longer keeping his focus on martial arts.

‘What am I aiming for? What should I aim for?’

Mo Li shuddered upon thinking of this. Clarity returned to his eyes, and an expression of remorse appeared on his face.

Since he was a king tier, his mindset was naturally outstanding. A sudden realization was enough to change his entire life.

“I understand.” He nodded, and said, “Senior Brother, if Mo Li becomes successful in the future, it will all be thanks to your words today.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Farewell.”

“Then, Young Master Yun...” Mo Li looked toward the little boy. This was the child of a Great Saint, after all, so who could shoulder the responsibility if anything untoward were to happen?

“Rest assured, I’ll return him home safely,” Ling Han said with a nod.

Mo Li hesitated for a moment before saying, “Senior Brother, Young Master Yun’s mother is extremely haughty. Be careful not to anger her.” He lowered his voice when saying this as if he were afraid of anyone else hearing.

Young Master Yun’s mother—that was the wife of the Great Saint.
