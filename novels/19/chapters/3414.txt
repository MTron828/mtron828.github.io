“Then you agree?” Princess Bixiao looked expectant, because once Ling Han submitted, it meant that he would also be gifting her the Demonic Monkey

Fists.

She had personally witnessed the might of the Demonic Monkey Fists. It could even stimulate a Demonic Saint from the Primitive Age, making her covet it.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I have a third option instead.” -What?” Princess Bixiao faltered upon hearing this. Where was the third option?

Ling Han said unhurriedly, “The third option is for me to take you in. Since you would belong to me, you’ll naturally ensure my safety. En, a Mystery Realm Tier elite will be my bodyguard, so I’m quite at ease.

What kind of daydream are you having?

Princess Bixiao almost gave him a slap. ‘You’re far too fanciful, aren’t you? You actually want to take me in?’

Why don’t you just go to the heavens?

“You really dare to dream!” she said through gritted teeth.

Ling Han smiled and said, “Am I really dreaming?” He surveyed Princess Bixiao from head to toe, and said without any reservations, “Your figure isn’t too bad.

You can just barely qualify to become my maid!”

“Impudence!” Princess Bixiao suddenly stood up, and was just about to make a

move.

Ling Han wagged his finger, and said, “Say, Your Highness, you already said just then that I have Absolute Fairness. If an elite comes, I can easily deal with them.”

“So, if I apprehend the princess, and what’s done is done, then what would

Your Highness choose?”

Princess Bixiao couldn’t help but pale. Although she was also a prodigy, Ling Han should be even more freakish than her. In a battle at the same cultivation level… even if she had the advantage of a minor level, she would probably still be suppressed by Ling Han.

Yuwen Hou already proved this point.

She had planned everything out, yet she had never imagined that Ling Han would take such a risk.

“You wouldn’t dare!” she said through gritted teeth.

-Why wouldn’t I dare?” Ling Han said nonchalantly. “You said it yourself. I can block a wave of attacks from those Imperial Princes, but I can’t block the second wave, or the third wave. I’ll be killed eventually, so why shouldn’t I take a gamble?”

This!

Princess Bixiao felt that she had been tricked by her own cleverness.

Previously, she had used these words to threaten Ling Han, and now, they were being used on herself.

Was this karma?

But this had come too quickly, hadn’t it?

She was speechless. Indeed, he was about to lose his life, so what need was there for him to be afraid of taking a gamble?

“All right. From tomorrow onwards, I won’t come again!” Princess Bixiao was able to go with the flow.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ve changed my mind. Your Highness is so beautiful and enchanting, so I think it would be better to take you in as a concubine maid. I would have someone to hug when I sleep at night, and you could even become a part-time bodyguard. En, not bad.”

Not bad your sister.

Even Princess Bixiao wanted to curse. She was a princess, a princess!

She forcefully suppressed her anger, and said, “The upper limit of Absolute Fairness is Mystery Realm Tier. It may not be able to take full effect on me. Within half an hour, it would be completely impossible for you to suppress me.”

“Oh, then you can give it a try.” Ling Han smiled slightly, but did not use Absolute Fairness.

This was intimidation. Strategic use was more important than practical use.

Once it was used, neither side would be able to retreat.

Princess Bixiao felt like she was about to go crazy, yet she had no choice but to forcefully suppress her urge, and asked, “Then what do you want?” “Does Your Highness have any Treasured Fruits or something like that? I’m a glutton. Moreover, I would be partial after accepting a gift, so I am very easy to get rid of,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Princess Bixiao really wanted to smash her fist into Ling Han’s face. She had come to threaten Ling Han, and what was the result? Now, it was her that was being threatened.

She took a deep breath, and said, “I don’t have any Treasured Fruits anymore.

You’ve already stolen them!”

Speaking of theft, she couldn’t help but glare at Ling Han. Who knew if this brat had used her undergarment to do some unspeakable dirty deeds?

Ling Han wore a righteous expression as he said, “Say, Your Highness, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t spout nonsense. What kind of person am I? Why would I do such a dirty thing?

“Xixi, Xixi, Xixi!” Princess Bixiao had not even said anything, when the seven toddlers first undermined Ling Han’s declaration, and began to giggle.

Meanwhile, Princess Bixiao smirked coldly, and did not speak.

Ling Han could only sigh. His own people were dragging him down.

He thought for a moment, then said, “If there is no Treasured Fruit, then there is only one way. I am sure that Your Highness should have grasped quite a number of Spirit Diagrams, right? I am not greedy either. Giving me eight to ten sets would be enough to send me off.

Why don’t you just die!

Princess Bixiao looked at Ling Han. Why hadn’t she realized that Ling Han was actually shameless to this extent?

Spirit Diagrams, you think they’re cabbages, talking about eight to ten sets? However, she also knew that if she didn’t shed some blood this time, she wouldn’t be able to pass. Although this human was a ruffian, there was a ruthlessness in his eyes, a determination that made her heart throb.

“One Spirit Diagram!” she said, gritting her teeth.

Ling Han was observant, and knew that this was already Princess Bixiao’s limit. He quit while he was ahead, and said, “All right, just one Spirit Diagram.” Princess Bixiao waved her slender hand, and a jade scroll shot towards Ling Han. When Ling Han stretched out his hand to catch it, she took advantage of the opening to leap, and had already left the drawing room, standing in the middle of the courtyard.

This distance had exceeded the range of influence of Absolute Fairness.

Ling Han took the jade scroll and scanned it with his divine sense. He couldn’t help but smile and say, “Princess, you’re truly trustworthy.” This was indeed a Spirit Diagram, and it stimulated the power of flames. As for its level, it was unknown for the moment.

Princess Bixiao’s previous anger vanished, and she instead smiled beautifully, and said, “Ling Han, Ling Han, I’m truly interested in you now. If you can defeat all the Imperial Princes, I won’t mind giving you some consideration.

She floated up, and her figure shot forwards. With how astonishingly fast a Mystery Realm Tier cultivator was, she instantly disappeared from sight.

Hiss!

Ling Han bared his teeth. He had not thought that this princess of the Demon Race would actually have the potential to become a bewitching siren. Her last words caused even his heart to ripple slightly.

Moreover, if you want to leave, just leave. At the very least, take your carriage away. To leave it at his door for the night, wouldn’t that be inviting animosity to him?

However, Princess Bixiao had already fled, so he couldn’t threaten her at all. “Looks like this little girl is trying to swindle me to death,” Ling Han murmured. “Since that’s the case, if she falls into my hands in the future, hehe!”

“Father, what are you going to do?” Eldest Baby asked curiously.

“What does ‘hehe’ mean?” Second Baby asked as well.

The seven Calabash Brothers all looked at Ling Han with curiosity.

Even if Ling Han was extremely shameless, he still blushed slightly, and hurriedly broke into a run.

He returned to his room and began to study the newly obtained Spirit Diagram. This was communicating with fire energy, and Ling Han spent a little time to grasp it. Then, with a thought, boom, crimson flames appeared on his fist. They were burning and boiling.

Although they were both flames, there were naturally differences in strength. Ling Han competed with Fourth Baby, but the result was that it didn’t even have one-tenth of Fourth Baby’s might, and after Fifth Baby spat out a ball of water, the flames were extinguished.

Sigh, how could the high-level energy that a Spirit Diagram communicated with compare to a natural Mystical Power?
