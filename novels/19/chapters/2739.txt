2740 Experiencing the Power of a Dimension

Ling Han set off, accompanied by the Empress and the others.

He planned to invite the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, the large black dog, and the Rain Emperor as well. If they managed to succeed, they would become the most powerful, whether that was in the First Tier, the Sixth Tier, or the Seventh Tier.

It was anyone’s guess whether they would succeed or not, but it was at least worth a try.

However, it was a shame that only the Empress’ request for leave was approved. She was his wife, so she could enjoy such a benefit. However… this was not the case for the others.

The rules couldn’t be bent again and again. After all, Ling Han wasn’t a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han sighed with emotion. Where had Hu Niu gone? How nice it would have been to go together, no?

“She’s most likely on the fifth level,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded in agreement. Hu Niu had been led away by a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so it was very likely that she was cultivating in the battlefield of the fifth level—she was definitely cultivating as sending her into battle against Hysteria’s army in that level would be no different than sending her to her death.

“We’ll look for her when we return.”

The two of them held hands as they left. Meanwhile, the others all remained in the Celestial Guest Residence due to the limitations of their cultivation level.

They strolled casually, and it was as if they were a divine couple.

“If Hysteria didn’t exist, how nice would it be for us to find a quiet place to settle?” the Empress suddenly said with emotion.

She had battled against Hysteria’s army for many years, witnessing her fair share of blood and death. At this moment, she couldn’t help but make such a remark.

“After we defeat Hysteria, we’ll look for a quiet place to settle and have a bunch of children together,” Ling Han said with a smile.

There was a glimmer in the Empress’ beautiful eyes as she lightly bit her bottom lip. She was indescribably beautiful.

Ling Han was instantly seduced by her, and he immediately pulled her into the Celestial Guest Residence. In any case, they had heaps of time to spare, so it wouldn’t hurt to make some love.

After journeying for more than 300 years, Ling Han and the Empress finally arrived at the border between the Flaming Frost Realm and another dimension. This was the Profound Negative Realm, a high-level dimension.

There was no more battle here. However, different dimensions would repel each other, so even though there was no danger from other people here, there would definitely be dangers posed by nature.

Bursts of chaotic air currents hammered down, flaunting the Regulation-transcending might of heaven and earth.

Back when the Celestial Realm had collided with the Foreign Realm, a small world had been created. When this small world was eventually obliterated, the energy shock waves that it unleashed caused even Heavenly Venerate Wu Le to suffer wounds when he traversed through it. This was a clear sign of heaven and earth’s might.

“Why don’t you enter the Celestial Guest Residence as well? I’ll take us through this area,” Ling Han said.

The Empress nodded and entered the Celestial Guest Residence. She didn’t act stubbornly.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, causing golden symbols to instantly pulsate all over his body, forming a golden bell around him. He then strode forward, charging head-first into the currents of chaos.

Boom!

A devastating power surged over, causing the golden bell around Ling Han to shudder violently. It was as if the golden bell were about to shatter at any moment.

He hurriedly hastened his steps as visible fractures appeared on the surface of the golden bell. After just a few minutes, these fractures had already become cracks that allowed wisps of chaotic energy to barge inside.

Ling Han hurriedly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll with his full strength, repairing these cracks with great difficulty.

This was utterly terrifying. While channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his defense could rival that of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

He gritted his teeth as he continued to endure the barrage of attacks. However, the further he ventured into this area, the more devastating the burst of chaotic air currents became. The symbols on the golden bell continued to dim, while Ling Han continued to forcefully inject his power to repair the bell, allowing the symbols to light up again.

This was truly far too difficult. Ling Han’s stamina was vast, yet he couldn’t help but pant from time to time by now. He felt the urge to lie down and sleep for several years.

One had to realize that he hadn’t felt so exhausted even after battling against Wu Haoyang for tens of thousands of years.

He spat blood, and veins bulged all over his body. However, he still continued to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll no matter the cost. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a simple matter of him facing perilous danger. The Celestial Guest Residence would be immediately crushed, bringing death to the women inside.

For the sake of his lovers, Ling Han mustered an indomitable fighting spirit. It was a bitter battle, yet he continued to withstand and push forward, with his steps becoming quicker and quicker.

After an entire day, Ling Han finally made his way out of the danger zone.

Peng!

He instantly collapsed to the ground. He felt as if his bones were all crushed, and it was as if his body had been drained of all energy.

Only after lying down for 10 years did Ling Han finally pick himself back up. He felt like he had recovered 10% of his energy.

He started to extract Void Particle Energy. After another three years, he finally recovered 80% of his energy.

He didn’t sit around any longer, choosing to set off instead.

The Empress also came back out, and the two of them started to investigate this heaven and earth. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Spiritual Qi in this dimension was weaker than that of the Flaming Frost Realm, though it was still extremely rich and abundant. After all, this was a high-level dimension that was still countless times more powerful than the Celestial Realm.

The two of them set off to look for a giant volcano.

They desired to comprehend the unique power of this world, so the closer to the core of the world they were, the easier this would be. However, journeying to the core of the world was no easy task. According to Wally, they could reach the core of the world after finding a giant volcano and entering via its crater.

After several months, the two of them found a giant volcano, which they immediately entered.

Funnily, they came across a group of adventurers on their way, and these people actively warned them about the grave dangers of this area, most likely because of the Empress’ beauty. When they saw Ling Han and the Empress directly leap into the crater of the volcano, their eyes almost bulged out of their heads.

After looking around for a while, Ling Han and the Empress shook their heads.

The magma in this area was extremely high in temperature, yet it would still struggle to melt Divine Metal. Such a task would take it countless years. Moreover, it was very shallow in depth, and it wasn’t long before they reached the bottom. It was naturally impossible to reach the core of the world here.

Ling Han and the Empress exited the volcano and continued their search.

Of course, they didn’t forget to cultivate while embarking on this expedition.

Finally, after 7000 years, they found a supervolcano.

According to the legends of the Profound Negative Realm, this was a definite Forbidden Land. Even Celestial Kings would be forced to stop in their tracks.

However, Ling Han was fearless. After many years of recultivation, the Empress had also largely mastered the Regulations of this realm. She could once again wield a battle prowess at the Ninth Heaven.

They entered the volcano, and were immediately greeted by high temperatures. The Empress immediately let out an astonished yelp. The temperature here was far too high.

Ling Han drew her into the Celestial Guest Residence, and continued to venture on alone.

This volcano was surprisingly deep, and Ling Han still had yet to reach the bottom after descending for 10 days. At this moment, the magma around him had already become a dull red. Its destructive power was immense, and Ling Han had no option but to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to resist its power.

After descending for three years, Ling Han finally reached the bottom.

There was no more magma here. Instead, he was surrounded by chunks of strange stone. Before him was an expanse of void, in the center of which hovered an 18-colored orb that radiated with an indescribable might.

This was something that couldn’t be approached and couldn’t be touched. It was the core of the dimension.

In fact, the might of heaven and earth was profound. However, limited by the Regulations, only a small portion of this might could be unleashed. If anyone dared to touch the core of the dimension, however, they would suffer the full wrath of heaven and earth. That would be incredibly dangerous.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates had the right to touch the cores of dimensions. In fact, they could even destroy these cores of dimensions. However, Ling Han certainly couldn’t achieve this.

He didn’t dare to approach the core of the dimension at all, keeping his distance. If he walked any closer, he would be shattered into smithereens by the overwhelming power that the core possessed.

Meanwhile, the Empress had also exited the Celestial Guest Residence, and was sitting even further away from the core.

The two of them started to comprehend the power of the dimension, grasping the unique power of the Profound Negative Realm.

If a Ninth Heaven Celestial King wanted to advance to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, the first step would be to comprehend the unique power of the dimension. However, how many people could succeed?

This was far, far too difficult.

Thus, even with the Empress’ and Ling Han’s prodigious talent, they were still unable to make any progress in the short term.
