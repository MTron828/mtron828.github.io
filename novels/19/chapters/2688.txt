2689 Debt Collection Begins

The Wang Clan had sent over a dozen pieces of Divine Metal, but Ling Han did not use all of them. Now that the Divine Metal did not bear much significance to him, it was just appropriate for him to use it to settle the old outstanding debt to Wally.

Having made payment of what was due, Ling Han and the others set off in accordance to the route he had planned out, and began their journey to each clan to seek an explanation.

The Liu Clan was the closest to them, but even with the trio’s pace on foot, it took a month’s journey to reach the place.

They did not directly invade the place. Indeed, the Liu Clan had a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Though he had already gone to the Realm Battlefield much earlier, and would only come back once in a long time, who knew what kind of formation a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate would set up—perhaps one that could even kill a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

It would be wise to be cautious.

Wally stepped up first, and shot out a beam of green light for scanning and checking out the actual situation of the Liu Clan.

After 100,000,000 years, Wally had also extracted all the energy in the Dimension Scroll, and his “conversion” efficiency far exceeded that of Ling Han. Ling Han had no idea if Wally’s battle prowess had increased, but this scanning ability of his had indeed been improved by few hundred fold, and under the channeling of his intent, green light beamed out for a few hundred meters before becoming transparent in color, like the rays of sunlight, and even a Heavenly Venerate wouldn’t be able to distinguish it.

“19 beings with Vitality Index of about 13,000 and 37 beings with a Vitality Index of about 12,000…” Wally said as he was getting a clear picture of the actual situation of the Liu Clan.

There were only 19 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, which wasn’t enough to fight them.

Ling Han sighed ruefully, and then he laughed in spite of himself. 19 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could just barely manage to block two Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and in this world where the Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t appear, what was there to worry about?

Moreover, even if there was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, how would he dare to offend the Liu Clan? Wouldn’t he be afraid that the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate of the Liu Clan would flip out?

“Brat, are we really going to do it?” the large black dog asked. He was still a little terrified. After all, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had only been a First Tier Heavenly Venerate back then, far inferior to the one from Liu Clan.

“Of course!” Ling Han nodded. He had neither provoked anyone nor stirred up problems for anyone, and yet these nine major forces wanted to capture him for concocting alchemical pills. How could he let this slide?

“Is there any power at the Heavenly Venerable Tier?” Ling Han asked Wally.

Wally shook his head. “No.”

Since Wally said that there was none, then it had to be so. Come to think of it, that would be about right—with the prestige of the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate in addition to 19 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, would they need anything else?

“Let’s go!”

Ling Han walked out first. The large black dog hesitated for a moment, and followed suit, while only Wally stayed in the same spot, and transformed his body into a stone. If it weren’t for Ling Han and the large black dog witnessing the transformation with their own eyes, it would be impossible to distinguish him from other stones.

“I’m not going,” Wally said. “I’m an analytical War Soldier, not a combatant.”

“It’s better for Grandpa Dog to be in charge of cleaning up the battlefield, and wrap things up at the end.” The large black dog became terrified.

“You’re coming with me!” Ling Han grabbed the large black dog. It was fine for Wally since he was only helping out, but the large black dog wanted to reap without sowing?

“No, don’t!” The large black dog kicked out his hind legs madly, bearing a miserable expression like he was about to be eaten as dog meat.

The two of them, one walking and the other screaming, soon came to the front door of the Liu Clan.

In fact, this was a city, but it completely belonged to the Liu Clan. Although there were some people in the city whose surname wasn’t Liu, they were all extended family members of the Liu Clan, and they formed the huge structure of the Liu Clan together with some servants.

There was a guard at the door, and seeing Ling Han dragging a large black dog over, though it was extremely strange, he still dutifully stepped forward, and asked, “Who is it?”

Ling Han stopped in his tracks, and said, “Go inform those who have the authority to speak and decide, and say that Ling Han is here to collect a debt!”

Debt collection? Coming here to the Liu Clan?

There were four guards at the entrance, and they all sneered when they heard this. ‘What kind of place is the Liu Clan? It is a holy place overseen by a Heavenly Venerate, are you here to court death?’

“Insolence!” A guard jumped out immediately. Without knowing the strength of Ling Han, of course they wouldn’t notify the higher-ups. Otherwise, the Liu Clan might put up great fanfare, but the visitor could actually be just someone of Mountain River Tier. Wouldn’t that make Liu Clan the laughingstock of the realm? And they would be severely punished.

“Take him down!” He made a move and grabbed Ling Han.

Ling Han stepped on his foot lightly, and ka, the ground suddenly split open, a crack extending from under his foot all the way to the city wall. When it reached the root of the city wall, it didn’t stop, but continued to move up. Ka, ka, ka, a humongous crack immediately appeared on the city wall as if it was a mouth bared out in a grin.

The guard who made the move earlier stumbled, and his body swayed for a moment before he regained his footing. He stared in horror at the crack around him, and turned around following the extension of the crack. When he saw that the city wall was damaged, he was practically scared out of his wits.

This city wall had been refined and enhanced by many Celestial Kings, and it was sufficient to withstand several attacks from high-level Celestial Kings, but Ling Han just stomped his foot, and the city wall was cracked open; there was no direct attack at all. Wasn’t this enough proof of how powerful Ling Han’s strength could be?

The four guards trembled simultaneously; this was a really overwhelming strength!

It was just that they were still puzzled. No matter how strong Ling Han was, he couldn’t be compared to the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Why would he dare to charge here to the doors of the Liu Clan?

“What’s going on?” A sharp voice sounded, and a figure flew out from within the city and landed at the city gate. He pointed to the crack in the city wall and interrogated the four guards.

This was a young man. Judging by the flame of life, he had cultivated for hundreds of millions of years at most, but was already wrapped around by a ribbon of iridescent light. He was a First Heaven Celestial King, which was truly extraordinary.

The four guards were still numb, and upon hearing what was said, they all pointed towards Ling Han.

Him?

The young man looked at Ling Han, and couldn’t help it as the corners of his mouth twitched.

What kind of combination was this pair?

Ling Han appeared normal, but he was holding a large black dog, and this large black dog was too abnormal. Although his fur was smooth like satin, he was wearing a pair of black iron underwear, which was reflecting cold light. No matter how one was to look at him, there was a vulgar aura that emanated from him.

“Just who do you think you are, how dare you destroy the gate of our Liu Clan?” The young man knew that he himself wouldn’t be able to do this, and that his strength was definitely not equal to Ling Han’s, but when he was asking this, there was an air of haughtiness and arrogance about him. He completely looked down on Ling Han.

This was the arrogance of the members of a noble Heavenly-Venerable-Tier clan. They were like: so what about it? Given a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate as my ancestor, I can be overbearing and an arrogant bully. If you don’t agree, then I will destroy you.

Ling Han sighed, stretched out his left hand, and slapped the young man through the air.

With the kind of strength did he have now? Since he already made a move, how would a First Heaven Celestial King be able to block it?

Pa, impacted by a slap in the face, the young man was suddenly sent flying, and quite coincidentally became embedded in the crack of the city wall, like a decoration.

This person was a direct descendant of the main line of the Liu Clan. Thus, seeing this, the four guards suddenly reacted, and hurriedly shouted loudly, “Fu… Young Master Fuming!”

A guard pointed at Ling Han as he said, “You, you’re in big trouble!”

“Quickly, go get reinforcements!” the second guard yelled anxiously.

Ling Han smiled. He effortlessly took out a chair, sat down, and smilingly said, “Don’t worry, I’ll be waiting right here. Go quickly and call someone over.”

Too arrogant, he was too arrogant!Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

All the four guards were extremely furious. Having barged into the Liu Clan and struck with absolutely zero restraint, Ling Han was still so relaxed?
