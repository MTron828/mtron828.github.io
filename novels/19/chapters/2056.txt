Chapter 2057: Halfway snatched

“What evil river waters! Almost hurt Niu!” Hu Niu was abruptly angered, furious at the river waters.

Ling Han smiled, and walked forwards as he held Hu Niu’s hand. “Come on. Let’s kill some more wild beasts.”

They began a hunting trip. Very soon, this made Hu Niu elated again because the little girl had food again. As a glutton, what else could she ask for?

One after another, wild beasts collapsed at their feet, producing a large number of Dragon Crystals for them. Though the majority was ordinary Dragon Crystals, this thing was still very nutritious, and had the amazing effect of aiding them in increasing their comprehension. Who would complain about having too many? Worse come to worst, they could always sell them in exchange for Star Stones.

They obtained more and more special Dragon Crystals, but it was still far from the map that Ling Han had spoken of. At least for now, it was still a mess, and there was absolutely no way to piece them together.

“Here’s another big guy!” Two months later, they arrived at a small hill. There was a golden lion ahead of them, but it had three tails. Upon closer look, each tail actually also bore a head, though they were much smaller, and weren’t very obvious.

What kind of monster was this?

“Who cares what kind of monster it is? We’ll kill it and eat it!” Hu Niu cried out, and was the first to charge out.

Ling Han, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou also hurriedly pursued. The coordination among the four of them was getting more and more tacit by now. When they joined forces, they could deal with even Heaven Soul emperor tiers. After all, intelligence was a clear weakness of the wild beasts here. They could be easily led around by the noise. Their superior battle prowess was all for naught, and there was no need to be afraid.

The four of them besieged it, but still spent close to eight hours before finally dealing with this big guy.

Ling Han had already gone a very long time without using the Great Clash of Source Powers, because he also wanted the three women to toughen up as well. Source Power was naturally best trained in actual battle.

“Yi, there’s a big guy here!” A voice filled with pleased surprise rang out. A group of seven appeared, and when they discovered that Ling Han and his group were here, they all revealed malevolent expressions.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over this group, and couldn’t help but feel surprised because there was actually a person that he knew among this group of seven.

Ruan Dongxiang.

Strange. Why did he see this guy wherever he went? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A yellow-robed middle-aged man stepped out from the group of seven, and arrogantly demanded, “You guys can scram now!”

When his gaze swept over Hu Niu and the other women, his eyes lit up, and he looked stunned, but did not say something along the lines of demanding that the three women stay behind.

After all, with them being able to kill such a large monster, the strength of these four people was definitely extraordinary. If they could avoid conflict, it was best to.

Ruan Dongxiang glared hatefully at Ling Han, but he had only managed to join this team by shamelessly currying favor with them, so how could he possibly dare to cause a conflict between these people because of personal grudges. He only prayed secretly that Ling Han would not be willing to compromise. In that case, even if both sides didn’t want a battle, there would be no other option.

“I don’t know how to. Why don’t you demonstrate by scraming first for our entertainment?” Ling Han said, smiling slightly.

‘If others do not offend me, neither will I offend others. But if they do, I will definitely beat them silly.’

The yellow-robed middle-aged man was momentarily stunned, and then showed a menacing expression. “At first, I wanted to let you guys live, but you have such a bad mouth, and are so determined to seek your own death!”

“What are you being so fierce for, ugly? Come over if you dare, and see how Niu will deal with you!” Hu Niu rolled up her sleeves, revealing a pair of forearms as fair as jade, instantly drawing the eyes of the seven.

Amazing beyond words and remarkably beautiful.

A green-robed man approached from the group of seven, and said to the yellow-robed middle-aged man, “Brother Lu, we don’t have to kill these three girls, right?”

“If we can capture them, go ahead. If they cannot be captured… we can only kill them!” The yellow-robed middle-aged man’s expression was vicious.

If they were of a mind to capture them alive, they would definitely have reservations when they attacked. Meanwhile, the four people on the other side had been able to kill a giant-sized wild beast, so their strength could not be weak. Thus, even though they had more in numbers, the moment they had reservations in their attacks, it was very easy for the tables to turn on them. That was why he had said they could capture them if it was possible for them to be captured. If they could not, then they could only kill them.

“Even if they’re dead, don’t waste them. I have a use for them,” a man in black said. His face was thin and wizened like an old man’s, but this was clearly a place only people below 10,000,000 years old could enter. He had probably cultivated some kind of evil cultivation technique which caused this kind of change in his body.

Hearing him say these words, even his companions showed expressions of disgust.

They knew very well that when this man was cultivating or sleeping, he would be embracing a dead body. He was practically a monster. However, this man’s strength was also incredible. Otherwise, they would not have brought him by their side. Merely looking at this kind of person would cause one’s eyes to hurt.

The Empress revealed a menacing expression. With her pride, she felt that everyone in this world should grovel beneath her feet, but now someone actually dared to disrespect her. She was naturally angered at this.

“At first, I just planned to teach you a lesson. After all, we do not have any kind of serious enmity between us, but now…” Ling Han paused, his killing intent beginning to flow out.

“Charge! Charge! Charge!” the yellow-robed middle-aged man shouted loudly. Instantly, the seven of them leaped out at the same time, launching an offensive towards Ling Han and his group.

Ruan Dongxiang’s expression was filled with malevolence, and a sliver of delight was present in his gaze.

On the way here, he clearly knew that these six companions were all peak-stage Heaven Souls. Though they had not even reached the extent of being a king tier, there were as many as six of them here. How huge would their battle prowess together be? Even the strongest in Ling Han and his party was only at Yang Soul. Even if he was a monarch tier, he could only be invincible against an Earth Soul. How could they match those at the Heaven Soul? What more the peak stage of the Heaven Soul.

In a battle of six against four, that naturally would mean a sure victory.

He was also very impressed with himself. He had finally found very strong backers, and would only need to cheer them on from the sidelines in any moment of trouble.

“Trash, accept your deaths!” Hu Niu leaped out, and struck violently.

However, if it was her alone, she was far from being a match for these six people. Very soon, she was blasted back.

“Ling Han, help Niu,” the little girl said.

“All right!” Ling Han replied with a smile, and charged out, the Empress by his side.

Bewitching Maiden Rou, however, did not join the battle. She could deal with a wild beast that did not have much intelligence, but against a human opponent, her weakness would be immediately exposed. Whichever one she was targeted by would be able to easily kill her, or even capture her. Thus, her best choice was to flee as far away as she could, and not join in on this excitement.

A great battle began, and soon reached the boiling point. They had all released their respective divided souls. Yang Soul would only have a single divided soul, while Heaven Soul had as many as four. The six people on the opposing side could manifest 30 figures altogether, and with them ganging up on Ling Han and his group that had three people with six bodies, the advantage in numbers was extremely obvious.

The Empress gave a clear cry, and the power of her bloodline activated. Instantly, there were additional 18 doppelgangers, which provided considerable compensation for their shortage of numbers. However, it did not effect any kind of qualitative change in terms of actual strength.

Fight, fight, fight.

Ling Han did not use the Great Clash of Source Powers, but he did cast the other celestial techniques one after another. His real enjoyment lay in fighting human opponents. After all, wild beasts were too dumb.

He used the Regulations of Time, and slowed down the attacks of their enemies respectively. Then, he used the Regulations of Space. Not only did his figure move gracefully, he would also occasionally banish the attacks of his opponents, repeatedly helping the Empress and Hu Niu out of danger.

“Kill the man first!” The six people on the opposing side could tell that if they did not kill Ling Han first, there would be absolutely no possibility that they could defeat Ling Han and his party.

Ling Han was unafraid. If they all came to attack him, then what difference would these six people have compared with the wild beasts that the four had previously encountered? Like this, Hu Niu and the Empress would be able to unleash their full battle prowess.
