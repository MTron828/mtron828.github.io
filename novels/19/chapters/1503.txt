Chapter 1504 Treasure chest?

The three True Phoenixes were actually pulling a chariot behind them, and on the chariot, aside from a chest, there was nothing else. What stunned Ling Han and his companions even further was not just that, but also that these three True Phoenixes... had already passed on.

These were three phoenixes that had died who knew how long ago, but Saint Kings were immortal. They still maintained their appearance from when they were alive. However, there was not the slightest bit of life to them any longer. It was merely because phoenixes were elementally aligned with fire that innumerable divine flames were burning on their wings.

So bizarre.

Three True Phoenixes were pulling a chariot, and it was unknown how many years they had been dead for.

Who could make three Saint King-level True Phoenixes pull a chariot?

What astonishing wealth!

“This is the treasure trove of the Heavenly River King?” Ling Han looked at it, and involuntarily hissed. This was really too easily obtained, wasn’t it? It was not suitable as a trap for Gu Daoyi.

The three True Phoenixes had already stopped, and curbed their wings as if they were sleeping. Meanwhile, there was still endless divine flame burning on their bodies.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden involuntarily revealed a vacant expression, and she walked forwards.

Ling Han quickly pulled her back, and said, “Don’t be rash.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden paused, and her eyes became clear. She said, “I feel as if these three True Phoenixes are summoning me.”

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han thought for a moment. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden possessed the Cloud Phoenix bloodline, and the Cloud Phoenix was a branch off of the True Phoenixes. Whatever reason there was for the death of these three old phoenixes, their bones, physical bodies, and blood were all invaluable precious treasures.

An ordinary person could not possibly obtain them, because they would not be able to hold up to such pressure. However, if they were the ones summoning her, it was possible that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden would obtain a massive good fortune.

After some thought, Ling Han released his hold, and said, “Be careful. If there is any danger, absolutely don’t force yourself.”

“I understand.” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden walked forwards. Her wings spread out on their own, exuding the power of the bloodline of the Cloud Phoenix.

The three phoenix corpses unfolded their wings at the same time, wrapping around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Then, silence fell, and there was not the slightest bit of sound.

Ling Han could no longer sense the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. No matter how powerful he was, he could not possibly penetrate the barrier set up by the divine sense of a Saint.

There should be no problem.

If the Saint King wanted to kill someone, what need was there to go through so much trouble. A single thought would be enough. Even if the three old phoenixes had long died, their might was still existent. A single thought could still easily kill a Small Saint or a Medium Saint, and even a Great Saint would not dare come too close.

This was a great fated opportunity for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and perhaps would allow her to be reborn.

Ling Han broke into a grin. The horn of the True Dragon was settled, and now it looked like the feather of the Heavenly Phoenix was obtainable as well. Those were three Saint King-level True Phoenixes; simply plucking one of their feathers would be enough.

“What’s in the chest?” Empress Luan Xing was very curious.

“Let’s open it and take a look.” Ling Han climbed up the chariot. This was an extremely ancient item. There were holes everywhere on the armrests of both sides, and they had all been blasted out by supreme God Tools, murderous aura bubbling from them.

Ling Han did not dare touch them, and carefully avoided them.

He wanted to draw this chest into the Black Tower. Then, no matter what danger it posed, the Black Tower would be able to suppress it. But the problem was that this chest seemed to have been glued to the chariot, and the chariot was being pulled by three True Phoenixes. If he wanted to take it in, he would have to take in the three True Phoenixes as well.

This was an impossible feat. Though the three True Phoenixes had long since died, they still had an obsession that could not be dispersed. Otherwise, they could not possibly travel through the universe, and fly over when they sensed they were being summoned by the spell.

...Unless Ling Han’s will was stronger than even these three True Phoenixes, and could take them in by force. And this obviously was impossible.

Ling Han turned around, and told Empress Luan Xing, “I’ll open the chest, step back a bit.”

This time, the Empress did not obey. Instead, she drew out the brick. “You open it. If any attack blasts out, I will block it.”

With the brick in hand, the world was hers.

Ling Han saw her expression was filled with determination, and nodded.

With the Empress buying time by blocking, he could take the two of them into the Black Tower if there was any danger.

He lowered his body, and went to open the chest.

The chest could not be easily moved, but it was comparably much easier to open the chest.

“So heavy!” Ling Han gritted his teeth. He felt that the chest lid was slightly loosened, but its weight was even more frightening than 100,000 mountains. It was practically as heavy as a whole planet. With a burst of all his power, Origin Power, and stamina, the chest lid was finally lifted just that slight bit.

And that was just him. Otherwise, if it had been another person, it was impossible even if they had such power. They would only tear off their own hands.

It was too heavy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The chest opened a slight bit, and majestic light flickered as if an astonishing rare treasure was about to appear.

“Ah!” Ling Han released a large shout, used all his power, and raised the chest lid a bit more.

At this moment, he suddenly felt the pressure ease in his hands. The chest was actually opening on its own.

Ling Han took a step back, and stood beside Empress Luan Xing. Meanwhile, the Empress had raised the brick high, and was careful and vigilant.

Weng, the chest was open, and a streak of majestic light shot into the skies as if an exceptional divine treasure was being unveiled.

After a very long while, this majestic light finally gradually faded, but there was still light rippling in the chest, though it was not as blazingly bright as it had once been.

Ling Han and the Empress both involuntarily took a step forward, wanting to take a closer look. They were really much too curious.

“Yi?” they exclaimed in surprise. That was because it was not some kind of treasure that the chest contained, but rather a scene of chaos. They could not see through it at all.

What the hell was that?

“Every flower means a world of its own, could this chest also be a chest of its own?” Ling Han wore a strange expression. The treasure left behind by the Heavenly River King had actually appeared in this manner?

“Let’s go in and take a look?” Empress Luan Xing asked Ling Han’s opinion.

“All right!” Ling Han nodded. He was an extremely curious person in the first place. Since things had progressed so far, there was naturally no reason for him to shrink back now.

It was necessary to take due caution. Ling Han summoned a Demonic Beast from within the Black Tower, and threw it over at the treasure chest.

This was a wild bull. Its tail touched the chest first, and it was immediately sucked in like a bull made of mud dropped into the sea. In the process of being sucked in, though it was still struggling, it did not appear to have been wounded. It just could not manage to struggle free.

Very soon, this wild bull had disappeared.

Ling Han threw over a tiger, a wolf, and so on.

Ling Han dragged out the Asura Demon Emperor as well. Immediately, the latter’s face paled in fear; fearing that Ling Han would really throw him over while he was at it, he hurriedly shouted, “Master, I am the Little Asura, don’t throw me in too.”

Cowardly and fearing death was his true character, which he was no longer embarrassed about.

Ling Han chuckled. After trying so many times, he was 99% sure that the process of entering into this treasure chest, at least, was not dangerous. As for what lay within, he had no idea.

“Let’s go in and take a look.” He shot out a kick with his foot, and the Asura Demon Emperor suddenly fell in. Then, Ling Han pulled the Empress and they both jumped into the chest.

Weng, being tugged by an unidentified force, Ling Han and his companions arrived at the foot of a mountain. Ahead of them was a huge mountain, but a massive paw was pressing down on the mountain top. It had been snapped, and was still bleeding as if it had just happened yesterday.

And in the outside world, a starship was closing in at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Suddenly, it stopped, and seven people leaped out from within.
