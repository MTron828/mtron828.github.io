Chapter 2463: Crushing Celestial Kings

“Sorry, I’ve made everyone wait.” Ling Han had already adorned a set of new robes. Through Rising From The Ashes, his injuries were naturally all gone, and he had recovered to a complete state.

Actually, he had no need to “die” just now, but had an inexplicable feeling that he had to shed his old shell.

Hence, he chose to execute Rising From The Ashes.

It was very different.

Ling Han only felt like his body was especially light. Great dao had become extremely clear to him, as if he himself was Dao, part of heaven and earth itself. If he had to attack anyone, he could just directly grab a streak of great dao and throw it over, slice it over, or slash it over, and nothing could not be destroyed.

As for defense, he could immerse himself in great dao, and no matter how powerful one’s attacks were, he himself was great dao, so what could one do to him?

Of course, this was only a misconception. Every Celestial King had this kind of ability, and it would have to depend on whoever had a greater and more powerful grasp of great dao.

However, it should be known that Ling Han was still not a Celestial King yet!

“Damn it, he’s broken through!” a Celestial King exclaimed through gritted teeth.

“That’s not right!” Yu Wudi’s eyes suddenly widened. “There are no unusual scenes of the heaven and earth appearing.”

When a Celestial King achieved dao, there would be a reaction from the heaven and earth. There would be countless auspicious clouds and a fragrance that spread everywhere.

But all of this had not appeared.

“His heavenly tribulation is unusual, so it is also possible that the reaction from the heaven and earth would be unusual as well.”

......

“En, this boy is strange, and we should not use usual logic for him.”

Or so the other Celestial Kings said. Ling Han had to have broken through to the Celestial King Tier. Otherwise, how could he possibly exude the aura of a Celestial King? Moreover, if he had not broken through, why would a heavenly tribulation have descended previously?

Did you think that the heavenly tribulation was like an uncle that could be invited to come at any time?

They all shook their heads. Ling Han had broken through to the Celestial King Tier, so his battle prowess had naturally soared. Even if the six of them joined forces, it would be very difficult, no, it should be that they would no longer be able to stop him. This brat had already been so powerful as a Pseudo-Celestial King, and now that he had become a Celestial King, he would be even more frightening than before.

Ling Han set his eyes on the six great Celestial Kings, revealing an intense killing intent. “Are you all ready to die?”

“You have but broken through to the Celestial King Tier, what is there to be so proud about?” one of the Celestial Kings shouted at Ling Han.

Xiu, Ling Han darted out. A terrifying power surged, and he arrived in front of that Celestial King in an instant. His left hand gripped a streak of great dao, entwined it around his fist, and shot out a punch.

This punch was extremely and extraordinarily fast.

That Celestial King was not to be trifled with, either, naturally, and had already made his own preparations. It was naturally impossible that he would be hit so easily. Immediately, with a furious roar, the sound turned into waves. He, too, grabbed hold of a streak of great dao and countered Ling Han’s attack.

Peng!

With this blow, that Celestial King was instantly sent flying, his body glowing with light. This was not a sign that he was about to unleash his power, but rather that his body had split apart, and this had led to celestial light seeping out of it.

When the other Celestial Kings saw this, they were all stunned, and even Yu Wudi’s eyes dilated in shock.

Though Ling Han had killed a Celestial King before, some of the credit was owed to it being a sneak attack and the fact that the latter had been caught off guard. But this was different. Ling Han’s attack had come head-on in a frontal confrontation, bold and straightforward. Furthermore, he had not depended on the might of the Celestial Tool, either.

He had been able to beat a Celestial King to the point his body cracked apart with a single punch. Though the victim had not died, and it could not compare to complete destruction, it was still extremely terrifying.

How could his battle prowess be so strong?

Ling Han was very pleased. Flexing his arms, he felt like he could understand his power clearly. His blood was blazing, and there was an indescribable comfortable feeling about it.

At present, he was only short of turning the Celestial Seed Mark into a true Celestial Seed away from becoming a Celestial King, but because he felt that his Celestial Seed Mark could be further completed, he had not rushed to complete the breakthrough.

By now, his Vitality Index was roughly around 5600 points, which was enough to crush the majority of First Heaven Celestial Kings.

Furthermore, Ling Han guessed that once he truly broke through, his Vitality Index would reach around 6800, 6900, or even close to 7000 points.

“I’ll take your head first!” Ling Han charged over, waving the Divine Demon Sword in hand. He was going to chop off the head of that wounded Celestial King.

“Help me!” that Celestial King hurriedly shouted, his tone panicked.

He had never encountered this kind of crisis. They were clearly both First Heaven Celestial Kings, yet he could not even withstand a single blow.

…If he knew that Ling Han was actually still a Pseudo-Celestial King, he would probably spit out a mouthful of blood.

Yu Wudi and the others hurriedly moved to assist him. They still felt a sliver of hope, and wanted to again try the might of their combined forces to see if they could suppress Ling Han together.

But they immediately knew what despair was, and what incomparable battle prowess was.

Ling Han could not be stopped at all. His left hand controlled Regulations, and extremely frightening streaks of great dao descended down on them. Meanwhile, his right hand was waving the Divine Demon Sword, slicing with all kinds of Regulations, including Time and Space.

Yu Wudi was mad with jealousy. He was a Monarch Star, and he should possess battle prowess superior to the peak stage of the First Heaven Celestial King Tier upon his breakthrough, and after he stabilized his cultivation level, he should even be able to battle a Second Heaven Celestial King.

But now? When he had been undergoing a heavenly tribulation, he was disturbed by Ling Han. Even if he had stabilized his cultivation level, his present battle prowess was only at the peak stage of the First Heaven, which did not match his status as a Monarch Star at all.

More importantly, when Ling Han had undergone a heavenly tribulation, he, too, had been disturbed, but his battle prowess had reached the peak stage of the First Heaven steadily, and after it was stabilized, it would be an easy matter for him to match a Second Heaven Celestial King.

So how could Yu Wudi not be jealous?

Ling Han aggressively attacked that wounded Celestial King. After landing three punches, that Celestial King could no longer fight back, and with a swipe of Ling Han’s sword, his head was removed from his body, flying high into the air.

Suddenly, the heaven and earth shared grief, and a rain of blood descended.

Ling Han’s hand held the Divine Demon Sword, his expression aloof and cold.

Yu Wudi and the other great Celestial Kings were all astounded. The five of them had worked together to stop him, yet Ling Han was still able to kill that Celestial King easily. What did that mean?

If Ling Han was going to target them, it would also be difficult for them to escape unscathed.

The moment this kind of thought rose, they all broke out in a cold sweat.

Death—no one desired it, especially when they were Celestial Kings. They were noble and highly placed, like they themselves were the heaven and earth.

They exchanged looks, and suddenly all of them turned around and fled.

They no longer wanted the secrets that Ling Han possessed. The freakish nature of this boy was indescribable, so it was best that they did not have any designs on him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“How can there be such a good thing?” Ling Han asked coldly. Stretching out his left hand, the great dao of Space was grasped in his hand, and surged towards the five great Celestial Kings.

Ensnare!

Instantly, the bodies of the five great Celestial Kings stiffened, and they could not advance the slightest inch further.

But Yu Wudi roared loudly, and the Violet Divine Staff unleashed its might. He could not be stopped, and immediately escaped from the restraint. However, he did not have any intention of bothering with the others at all. Instead, he immediately ran, brandishing his staff.

“Yu Wudi!” the four great Celestial Kings roared in fury, but Yu Wudi only acted as if he had not heard them, and ran even faster.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and did not give chase.

Yu Wudi could run, but he couldn’t hide. However, he would leave the Celestial Path soon after, so it was best that he first dealt with these four Celestial Kings.

“Die!” Ling Han waved the Divine Demon Sword, Sword Qi dancing and dazzling the skies.

“Fight it out with him!”

The four Celestial Kings all released powerful attacks, their vitality soaring. They had temporarily escaped the constraints, and their battle prowess actually soared even further.

This was an incredible spike in battle prowess that they had paid a very exorbitant price for, but it definitely could not be maintained for long. Furthermore, there would be very strong sequelae too.

Ling Han was unconcerned. He had a grasp of great dao, and various Regulations of the Great Dao were channeled by his will. The Divine Demon Sword itself was glowing as seal after seal took form.

This was his forging of the Divine Demon Sword so that it would become a true Celestial Tool!
