Chapter 1115: The Tiger That Guards the Door

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xiu , the sharp arrow shot out.

This arrow was incredibly fast, turning into a streak of light that rapidly shot towards that strange Demonic Beast.

Ling Han nodded internally. This shot might not be as powerful as the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, but the gap wasn’t very large. However, if he shot the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow with this bow and arrow, the might would definitely be even stronger.

...If he shot out the Ultimate Arrow, it would be even more so.

Ding!

The arrow arrived, releasing a series of fiery sparks, and then bounced back.

The Demonic Beast seemed to have been startled awake, and suddenly stood up.

It was like someone suddenly grabbing a rug in the middle part, and then picked it up, making for a very bizarre sight. But in the process of rising, the form of this Demonic Beast was also changing. It actually turned from a thin “rug” into a fierce tiger.

It was 30 meters long and 15 meters tall. It was completely crimson, and the fur on its neck seemed to be burning, displaying its awe-inspiring presence.

Everyone watched this with shock, not because of the appearance of the Demonic Beast, but rather because this shot from Shao Sisi had actually not had the slightest effect.

This was extremely astonishing.

“The abilities of Demonic Beasts are beyond our expectations.”

“What should we do? Force our way in?”

“How about we first have a few of us draw this Demonic Beast away, then open the large doors, and we go together afterwards?”

“This is not a bad idea, it is obviously meaningless to continue wasting our time here.”

Everyone nodded.

After a discussion, they decided to have Du An, Quan Lixuan, and Su Jing draw the Demonic Beast away, whereas the remaining number would be responsible for opening the doors.

They were all geniuses of the present era. Since they had already laid out a plan, they would naturally proceed according to their plan to the letter, not hesitating in the slightest.

“Ugly, come chase us!”

The trio began to provoke it, but that Demonic Beast merely lay there lazily, ignoring them completely. Just like it had not pursued them when it had been shot earlier, it was so lazy that it practically raised their hackles in anger.

Du An and his group quickly made their moves, blasting out stream after stream of Origin Power towards that Demonic Beast.

At first, the Demonic Beast was too lazy to care, but when it had been hit many times, it finally lost its patience. With a roar, it charged towards the three of them.

This pounce was extraordinarily fast.

Du An and his group fled in different directions, using the terrain in this place to play a game of hide and seek with this Demonic Beast.

Ling Han and the others rushed out too, and began to barrage the doors. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Large bangs sounded out continuously, but what shocked them was that these doors were so sturdy they seemed unbreakable.

Everyone used their respective ultimate moves, but no matter how powerful their attacks were—even normal cultivators at the peak stage of the consummate level of Mountain River Tier would be insta-killed—they were completely useless against these big doors.

“We can’t open it, we can’t open it at all!”

They had no choice but to admit that in the face of these doors, their power was just like an ant trying to shake a tree, unable to move the latter in the slightest.

Shao Sisi, who was a careful person, suddenly pointed at that Demonic Beast as she exclaimed, “Look at the neck of that tiger.”

Everyone turned their heads and saw that there actually seemed to be a key hanging around the neck of that Demonic Beast.

“Looks like we must defeat this fierce tiger, and take that key to open these doors.”

“We cannot use shortcuts.”

“Then, let us call Brother Du and the others back, and battle with our full effort.”

All of them were heroic characters. Previously, they’d chosen to draw the tiger away only because they had not wanted to waste their time, but now that their only option was to battle, they feared nothing.

Shui Yanyu and the spear-wielding man stepped back to one side. In this kind of battle, they could not possibly interfere, or it would be merely seeking their own deaths. That was because this demonic tiger was very powerful. If that had not been the case, Du An and the others would not have needed to draw it away, and would have only had to trap it on one side.

They sent out a signal for Du An and the others to return.

“Huh?”

Du An and his group all circled back, and when they saw that the big doors were still tightly locked, they couldn’t help but be curious.

“There is no need to ask. We can’t open these doors at all; we need the key hanging on the neck of that Demonic Beast,” Guan Rong explained.

“Haha, then we just have to fight.” Du An and his group were also not the slightest bit afraid.

The eight great prodigies stood together to receive the demonic tiger that was racing back towards them.

The strength of this demonic tiger was a little inconceivable; there were actually as many as 80 divine patterns on its body!

What kind of concept was this?

It was equivalent to an eight-star genius. Furthermore, as it was at the peak stage of the consummate level of Mountain River Tier in the first place, added with the power of eight stars, it was so incredibly powerful that none would dare to befriend it.

No wonder there was a need for 10 to form a team. Though Ling Han and the others were all prodigies among prodigies, fighting this Demonic Beast, they would only be defeated. Theoretically, the number of 10 would be able to compensate for the gap of a single star in battle prowess.

After all, these prodigies had not yet formed their fifth Mountain River, so against this Demonic Beast, they were practically at a loss for what to do.

“Come on!” All eight were confident.

Aside from Ling Han, the other six had reached the peak stage of the consummate level of Mountain River Tier, their power reaching as high as six stars, and added with the secret techniques they knew, their battle prowess was at least seven stars. The battle prowess they showed when using their ultimate moves would definitely be capable of reaching eight stars.

Hence, there was still quite a high chance that they would win the battle.

“I’ll focus on the front,” Ling Han said.

This gained the complete agreement of Shao Sisi, Su Jing and Du An. Though Xia Wuque was very displeased, he did not object. They all knew that the toughness of Ling Han’s physique was far superior to theirs, so he was the best choice to be the main assault on the front.

Quan Lixuan and the others, meanwhile, had never witnessed Ling Han’s defenses, and were slightly surprised. A cultivator in the high extreme of Mountain River Tier was going to take the front?

But even Xia Wuque had not objected, so they naturally could only choose to trust him.

Ling Han drew out the Divine Demon Sword, and after awakening its power, immediately charged towards the demonic tiger.

Peng!

The demonic tiger waved a paw, and suddenly slapped down on Ling Han. Its power was too strong, almost reaching the true apex of Mountain River Tier. Ling Han was completely unqualified to stand strong against an attack of this strength.

“Wa!” He spat out a mouthful of blood, and couldn’t help but be depressed. Previously, he had been sucked dry by Empress Luan Xing; he had just recovered a little with much difficulty. Now, he was forced to throw up blood from an attack. Did the world have some kind of grudge against him?

This attack caused a few of his bones to be dislocated, but Ling Han’s Origin Power merely trembled, and his bones naturally went back to their appropriate positions.

He bounced off his feet, and once again charged over. Using the Fast Technique, his offensive was like a wave.

Quan Lixuan and the others watched on, dumbfounded. Being smacked with such powerful strength, you f****** came off unscathed. What kind of freak were you?

However, though Ling Han’s physique was freakish, that Demonic Beast was no ordinary character, either. Under Ling Han’s multiple slashes and attacks, it also appeared to be similarly unharmed as if it was indestructible like diamond.

This was really inconceivable.

Previously, it had transformed into a “rug”, being extremely soft, but now, it seemed to be like high-grade Godly metal, being incredibly hard. How could these two completely opposing traits possibly appear on the same body?

The Demonic Beast pounced, its battle prowess powerful, appearing to be almighty.

Ling Han restrained it up front, and the seven of them attacked with their full effort. However, every attack was a waste of energy. The freakishly high defenses of this Demonic Tiger had even surpassed Ling Han’s.

“This is definitely not a Demonic Beast, but rather a puppet!” Ling Han concluded. He had possessed such a physique only through cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so how could it be matched by any random creature that crossed their path? However, if this Demonic Beast was really a puppet built from Godly metal, it would be understandable. One would only need to use Level Five Godly metal to build this puppet, and the defenses were naturally not something that could be resolved by Mountain River Tier.

This would also explain why its strength was so powerful.
