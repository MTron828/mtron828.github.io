Chapter 1844: If You Have Any Complaints, Come to the Roc Palace

Ling Han had already been about to bring the Empress into the Black Tower. After all, he knew that he couldn’t rival two Immortal Palace Tier elites. Even if he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he would still be blasted into smithereens.

Moreover, Rising From The Ashes was no fun task. Doing so would leave him with severe wounds.

‘Who is it this time?’

He was extremely puzzled. One had to realize that he didn’t have any strong background in the Celestial Realm. In fact, he was much like an orphan who didn’t have parents. He could only rely on his own strength. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Sun Zhen and Zihe Ji were both astounded. That person hadn’t arrived yet, but they had managed to obstruct them simply by transforming their Regulations into two lengths of white silk. This power... was incredible!

“Friend, please come over for a discussion!” Sun Zhen said as he looked into the distance.

A Dragonhawk flapped its wings and instantly soared over from the distance. It measured 30 meters in length, and if it spread its wings, its wingspan would also measure 30 meters. There was a female knight sitting on the Dragonhawk, and she was dressed in a suit of golden armor. Her hair was silky-smooth, and she appeared extremely mighty and dignified.

Behind her, there was a flock of Dragonhawks, each of which was carrying a female knight. However, these female knights were all dressed in suits of silver armor.

“Piss off!” the female knight in golden armor said coldly.

“Friend, you’re taking things too far!” Zihe Ji said in extreme displeasure. Who was he? He was an elite from a Celestial King Tier force! Yet, this woman actually dared to speak to him like this?

The female knight in golden armor glanced at him before waving her hand.

Pa!

A whip suddenly appeared in her hand, and she continued to stare at Zihe Ji just like that. It was as if she would whip him if he dared to say anything else.

Zihe Ji shook with fury. Since when had he ever been viewed with such contempt before?

“Very well... Very well! By the looks of it, I need to test out this friend’s—”

Pa!

The female knight’s whip lashed out before Zihe Ji could even finish his sentence. This was a terrifying scene, with countless Immortal Beasts materializing in the air as the whip whistled over. However, all of these Immortal Beasts were either dead or riddled with wounds.

This was an attack that stifled even heaven and earth, and this was an attack that caused the heavenly bodies in the sky to tremor. It was as if these heavenly bodies were about to plummet to the earth.

Zihe Ji had no time to feel astonished, and he frantically raised his arms to block this attack.

Pa!

The whip struck him, and he was instantly sent sliding hundreds of meters back. His sleeves were destroyed, and there was a long and bloody gash on his arms. Blood gushed out.

He was a mighty Immortal Palace Tier elite, yet he had been wounded with a single attack.

Sun Zhen was stunned by this sight. One had to realize that Zihe Ji was just as powerful as him, and they were both fifth secret elites. As elites from Celestial King Tier forces, which of them would be a pushover?

However, Zihe Ji had suffered minor wounds after blocking just a single attack. This was enough to illustrate the gulf between them and their opponent.

“Friend, how should we refer to you?” Sun Zhen asked.

The female knight frowned before pointing at Ling Han, and saying, “My task is to take this person away. Those who obstruct me shall suffer death!”

‘How domineering!’

Fu Yan’s heart thumped as he watched this unfold. They were all from Celestial King Tier forces, so why was the Roc Palace acting in such a domineering manner? Perhaps there also existed huge gulfs between different Celestial King Tier forces?

Had he made a mistake? Should he have persisted until the end?

Ling Han also found this to be extremely strange. He didn’t recognize this female knight at all, so why was she willing to step forward and help him? Moreover, she was even willing to offend two Celestial King Tier forces!

“Friend, this brat has killed the successor of my Zihe Clan, and he’s also killed the Holy Son of the Thundercloud Palace. How can we let him off scot-free?!” Zihe Ji said in a baleful voice. He knew that this female knight was more powerful than him, yet he still had a four-star battleship. Was this something that an Immortal Palace Tier elite could withstand?

The female knight was seething with killing intent as she gazed at Zihe Ji with a cold expression. In the end, however, she decided not to attack him. Instead, she said, “If you have any complaints, you can come to the Roc Palace. It doesn’t matter who comes; the Roc Palace will accept all of your challenges!

“Now, piss off!”

‘Roc Palace!’

These words erupted inside Ling Han’s mind. No wonder they were willing to step forward and help him even though they didn’t know each other. As it turned out, they were from the Roc Palace!

“Where’s Hu Niu? Has she come?” he hurriedly asked.

A hint of displeasure spread across the female knight’s face, and she said, “The Young Imperial Empress’ title is Tianyun!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Hu Niu hasn’t come?”

The female knight seethed with rage. ‘Is there something wrong with your brain? I already told you that the Young Imperial Empress’ title is Tianyun. Why are you still calling her Hu Niu? What a basic name!’

If she could, she truly wanted to kill this person who was “soiling” the Young Imperial Empress. However, upon thinking of Hu Niu’s longing for Ling Han, all she dared to do was daydream about this.

The female knight gritted her teeth. She forcefully suppressed her anger, and said, “The Young Imperial Empress still needs to cultivate, so she didn’t come over.”

Zihe Ji and Sun Zhen were both extremely confused. What in the world was this Roc Palace?

The Celestial Realm was far too large. To say nothing of the Western Celestial Realm that was separated by the boundless seas, it would be almost impossible for one to know about a force on the same continent if it was located slightly further away. Perhaps the Purple River Celestial King[1] or the Thundercloud Celestial King would know about this force. However, they might not reveal this information to their subordinates.

Generally speaking, it would have been almost impossible for them to come across elites from the Roc Palace.

“So what if you’re from the Roc Palace?” Zihe Ji asked in displeasure. Could the Zihe Clan allow one of their potential successors to die for nothing?

The female knight was already filled with fury, and Zihe Ji’s question was a spark that caused her to finally erupt.

“You’re seeking death!” she roared.

Whoosh!

Her whip whistled over again.

However, Zihe Ji was prepared this time, and he hurriedly unleashed a celestial technique to block this attack. An overwhelming aura surged into the surroundings, rising from his head and soaring into the sky as it transformed into the projection of a roaring white tiger. This tiger then spat out a giant golden sword that slashed at the female knight.

Pa!

The whip cracked down, and its might was surprisingly 100 times more powerful than before. Zihe Ji was astounded, yet there was already no time for him to dodge. The whip sliced through him, ruthlessly cutting him in two from the head down.

He wanted to unleash a celestial technique to knit his body back together, yet a devastating destructive power swept through his body.

Pa!

The two halves of his body instantly exploded, transforming into a cloud of mangled flesh and blood.

He was a mighty fifth secret Immortal Palace Tier elite, yet he was easily killed with a single strike.

Gasp!

Everyone went numb with shock. A cold chill shot down their spines, and cold sweat trickled down their foreheads.

She was too powerful, far too powerful!

She had killed a fifth secret elite on a whim! Moreover, she was completely uncaring about the Celestial King Tier force that stood behind him. They didn’t know what to say.

Sun Zhen involuntarily took a few steps back. His legs were trembling, and his situation was no better than what Fu Yan’s had been just then. Meanwhile, Fu Yan’s mouth was agape with shock. He was rendered completely speechless.

‘So be it if you killed Han Luo on a whim. After all, he was only the Immortal Palace Tier elite of a three-star force. However, Zihe Ji is a member of a Celestial King Tier force! Yet, you still killed him on a whim?

‘This...!

‘Is this extreme audacity, or is this extreme confidence?

‘What kind of existence is the Roc Palace? Where do they rank among the Celestial King Tier forces?’

The female knight cast a cold glance at Sun Zhen. Although she was looking at him, her eyes were filled with haughtiness and disdain. It was as if she would kill him if he dared to make another peep.

What could Sun Zhen say?

He quietly shut his mouth. He certainly didn’t want to die.

However, he had already come to a decision in his mind. When he returned to the battleship, he would definitely use the cannons to obliterate this arrogant woman.

The surroundings were deathly silent. This female knight was far too domineering, and under her might, even the Celestial King Tier forces didn’t dare to say anything else.

Meanwhile, Lin Fang, Teng Sen, and Wei Nian went pale with apprehension. They hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would possess such a terrifying background.

‘Holy f*ck! You’re clearly the successor of a Celestial King Tier force, so why were you acting as if you weren’t? You’ve truly screwed us over!’
