Chapter 539: Returning to Extreme Yang City

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Bringing two girls, one big and one small, Ling Han set out towards Extreme Yang City.

Hu Niu and Helian Xun Xue were born rivals. They would fight over food and fight over who got to stick to Ling Han. Furthermore, Hu Niu finally met a worthy competitor because Helian Xun Xue’s appetite actually did not lose to hers. In addition, she was naturally very strong, and so usually managed to get into an advantageous position.

Ling Han summoned Na Zhi Yan out for interrogation again, and found out that the Royal Clan of Helian actually had the bloodline of true dragons.

The Imperial Clan of the Central Sea possessed the purest bloodline of true dragons; the Sea Emperor of every generation was the ruler over all four seas, one who deserved the title of Emperor. In addition, all the Royal Clans of the four seas were no minor characters, either. They, too, had the bloodline of true dragons, but theirs was slightly inferior in purity.

No wonder.

Ling Han nodded. He had cultivated the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art, and once he reached the level of accomplished, he would possess the power of nine true dragons. Why did he use true dragons to make a comparison? That was because true dragons were the divine beasts with the most powerful physical bodies.

Since Helian Xun Xue possessed the bloodline of true dragons, even if it wasn’t very pure, her physical strength was definitely something to be feared.

Hu Niu was a freak, but there was too big of a gap between their cultivation levels, so it was natural that she could not compare with her—just look at how Ling Han, who had cultivated the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art, still could do nothing to Helian Xun Xue.

Helian Xun Xue was like a blank sheet of paper at the moment; one could freely write as one wished on it. Ling Han tried as much as possible to let her accept happy experiences. Even if she bickered with Hu Niu, that was only something playful, and not the kind of death battle that would take place between mortal enemies.

In comparison, Hu Niu seemed more like an adult as she never cried nor threw tantrums. Helian Xun Xue, on the other hand, would cry and throw tantrums. She obviously possessed a terrifying amount of bare strength, yet upon the slightest issue, she would widen her eyes in sorrow, looking like she would weep at any moment.

She had gotten addicted to acting adorable.

They passed through the Fallen Moon Gorge on their way into the north region. With their speed, they naturally did not need to spend a few months before finally making it into Extreme Yang City. In a mere ten days, they had once again returned to this ancient city.

Previously, they had been travelling at full speed, and though they had seen many cities on their journey, they merely passed by without entering. Thus, now that they had entered into the city, Helian Xun Xue immediately became excited and would look here and there at the surrounding sights.

Cotton candy? She took it. Sugar figurines? She took it. Bamboo toy horse? She took it.

Ling Han could only keep following behind her and pay for her. This Sea Girl had gone a little mad in her playing; as she ate, she would joyously laugh. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Childish!” Hu Niu declared in disdain, yet had forgotten that she, too, was holding onto a sugar figurine which she was currently licking happily.

“Yi, where did this little girl come from? She looks so pretty!” Helian Xun Xue was like a sprite, beautiful and filled with a foreign charm, and was naturally eye-catching. Soon enough, she caught the eye of some people.

That one was a spoiled young master, who was currently staring lewdly at Helian Xun Xue’s pretty face. His saliva was practically about to drip out of his mouth. However, just when his gaze moved downwards, wanting to **** at Helian Xun Xue’s entrancing mountains, he was stunned, and quickly shifted his eyes back upwards.

Too bad, she was flat-chested!

Helian Xun Xue tilted her head and looked at him, and asked in slight confusion, “Why are you blocking my path?”

The spoiled young master snickered, and said, “Little girl, follow me back, let us have some fun!” He was obviously used to having his way; waving his hand, he commanded, “Take her back.”

“Yes, Young Master!” Immediately from behind him, four sturdy servants stepped out, all of them looking as fierce as wolves and tigers.

Helian Xun Xue was so scared that she screamed in panic, and hurriedly ducked back behind Ling Han. With her speed, there were really not that many people who could catch up to her. Furthermore, so what if they actually caught up to her? With a shove backed by her titanic strength, probably even Ling Han would have his bones broken.

She obviously had terrifying power yet deliberately pretended to be weak. Did she not fear that she would be struck by lightning?

Ling Han mocked her behaviour internally, then turned and said to Helian Xun Xue, “Look what this trash is doing, this is called taking advantage of one’s position to bully others. Sea Girl, don’t you think that this kind of person is really detestable?”

Helian Xun Xue nodded her head quickly and patted her chest. With lingering fear, she said, “Detestable, almost scared me to death!”

“So, we cannot act like this kind of person, right?” Ling Han continued to guide her with enticing words.

“Right, we can’t act like this kind of person.” Helian Xun Xue nodded.

“However, we also cannot allow such trash to bully us. Remember, we do not take the initiative to trifle with others, as that is not a right thing to do. But if others trifle with us, we cannot hold our punches, either. When we should fight back, we should still fight back. We are not punching bags, right?” Ling Han continued.

These words were a little long, and Helian Xun Xue was a little dazed. However, out of habit, she still nodded and said, “Right!”

“Who do you think you damn are to actually dare to interfere in my matters?” The spoiled young master was displeased now. Did these two people treat him as empty air? They actually began to chat idly as if there was no one else around them. With a wave of his hand, he commanded, “Beat up this man until he’s disabled, then bring the girl back to the residence.”

“Yes, Young Master!” The four servants once again set forth.

With a flick of Ling Han’s finger, a flash of energy transformed into four streaks which respectively hit the foreheads of the four servants. Suddenly, pu, pu, pu, pu , a bloody hole appeared on the foreheads of the four servants, and they dropped onto the ground abruptly.

“You, how dare you, you actually dare to touch even members of my Zhang Clan?” the spoiled young master shouted in anger, both shocked and afraid.

“Who knows who you are!?” With another flick of Ling Han’s finger, pa , the spoiled young master followed in the footsteps of the four servants. A bloody hole appeared on his forehead, and he flopped onto the ground.

All around them, the passersby all stepped back. Matters had become serious. That was the young master of the Zhang Clan, yet he had actually died here. The Zhang Clan would definitely fly into a thunderous rage, and by then, whoever was actually present at the scene would be in for a bout of extremely bad luck.

They had better run quickly.

Yet Ling Han was absolutely uncaring. In the north region, there were pitifully few people that could fill him with wariness. Furthermore, didn’t he still have a tremendously strong princess of the Sea Race beside him? If needed, he could let her have the opportunity to train for a bit.

“Let’s go!” He continued to head towards the Spirit Treasures Pavilion. Meanwhile, Helian Xun Xue and Hu Niu, one on either side, held onto one of his hands.

Before entering into Extreme Yang City, Ling Han had disguised his appearance and made it so he looked like a young man in his mid-twenties. This shocked Helian Xun Xue a bit, but she still managed to see through his disguise with a single look.

Obviously, even if she had temporarily forgotten how to circulate her Origin Power, there was no decline to her perception, which was shockingly high.

The Spirit Treasures Pavilion was located in the center of Extreme Yang City, and even if they walked around and played around on their way here, they had still arrived in front of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion about an hour later.

“Hold it right there!” A group of people raced over. They should be the people of the Zhang Clan. When they found out one of their clansmen had actually been killed in broad daylight right out in the open, they naturally raced over to seek vengeance.

How could it be possible that Ling Han would pay them any heed? He simply stepped directly into the Spirit Treasures Pavilion. Hu Niu, though, turned back, and made a face at those people.

“Damn it!” the members of the Zhang Clan all roared in rage. The two most powerful parties in Extreme Yang City was the Spirit Treasures Pavilion and the Alchemist Society; who would dare make trouble in these two locations? They could only choose to wait outside; Ling Han couldn’t possibly hide inside for the rest of his life, right?

Ling Han and the girls entered into the Spirit Treasures Pavilion, and immediately, a beautiful female attendant approached and asked in a crisp voice, “Two honored customers, do you want to buy something?”

Hu Niu was extremely displeased, and, her hands on her hips, piped up, “Niu is here too!”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Pass along a message to Ying Hong. Just say that someone is here to fulfil an agreement.”
