Chapter 1414 Might of the Flying Fire Pill

This elder wasn’t some elite at the low extreme or high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Rather, he was an elite at the consummate level! Moreover, it was very likely that he had reached the peak stage of the consummate level!

Not only that, but this elder was also a three-star genius.

In terms of cultivation level alone, there was already a gulf of 11 stars between Ling Han and the elder. Add to that the power of the nation and natural talent, and Ling Han was at least 15 stars of battle prowess weaker than the elder.

Could he possibly overcome this disadvantage?

No way!

Ling Han glanced at the door behind him, and his expression instantly became resolute. He would defend this stone room at all costs.

It was his wife behind him, so he definitely couldn’t move aside. In fact, he couldn’t even take a single step back!

Thus... he would battle!

Ling Han roared as he activated Tide of the Ages. This was a celestial technique, and it was the most powerful technique that he possessed at this moment.

Weng!

The gigantic palm of the elder surged forward, yet it continued to grow dimmer and dimmer. By the time it arrived before Ling Han, the might that it possessed had already completely dissipated.

Upon seeing this, everyone was stunned into silence.

There was a gulf of 15 stars between Ling Han and the elder! How could there exist such a prodigy in this world?!

However, they had witnessed this with their very own eyes. Ling Han had genuinely blocked the attack of the elder.

The Eternity Sky Emperor’s eyes lit up, and he remarked, “Interesting!”

“Heh.” The Jade Drop Emperor was also astonished by what he saw. His fingers tensed slightly, and this was a sign that he felt an urge to battle.

“Good one, brat!” The elder also praised Ling Han for his astonishing feat. Although he hadn’t unleashed his full power in that strike, what was his cultivation level? He was even more curious about Ling Han now. At the same time, he was also more certain that Ling Han possessed some earth-shattering secret on his body.

He launched another attack. This time, his attack was 10 times more powerful than before!

Ling Han charged forward, activating Tide of the Ages again. This time, however, even Tide of the Ages was unable to completely dissipate the elder’s strike.

Thump, thump, thump!

Ling Han was forced to stumble back a dozen or so steps due to the remaining power of the elder’s strike.

Seeing that he would crash into the stone door if he took one more backward step, Ling Han resolutely gritted his teeth and forcefully stamped his right foot into the ground.

Peng!

His foot sunk into the earth, stopping his momentum and stabilizing his body.

If he had stumbled back and let the force naturally dissipate through his body, his powerful physique would have completely absorbed the power of the strike. However, because he had forcefully stopped himself, his insides started to churn due to the sudden change in momentum. He couldn’t help but spit a mouthful of blood.

However, he didn’t frown because of this. Instead, he stood tall and proud.

The onlookers were all moved by his determination, especially Qu Qiuxue and the other members of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. They couldn’t help but feel admiration for him.

Compared to Ding Li’an’s selfish love, Ling Han’s love was evidently more worthy of being called true love.

However, in the face of crushing power, what use was true love? Ling Han could withstand the attacks of the elder temporarily, but could he withstand them forever? He could withstand the attacks of one person, but could he withstand the attacks of 10 people or even 100 people?

“Elder Ge, shoo him away,” the Eternity Sky Emperor commanded.

Ling Han was blocking the stone door right now, preventing them from undoing the restrictions on it.

“Understood!” the elder said with a nod. He launched another strike at Ling Han, saying, “Come, young man, let us battle in the sky to our heart’s content!”

“Battle ya mom!” Ling Han spat. “With me here, none of you are going to touch my wife!”

The expressions of the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor changed drastically.

Why had they invaded the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire? Was it to seize the land of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire and kidnap the empress while they were at it, or was it purely to kidnap the empress for themselves?

Only the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor knew the answer to this question. However, they had both stated that as long as Empress Luan Xing was willing to marry them, they would even abdicate from their throne and make her the new ruler.

Yet, right now, Ling Han was actually referring to the empress as his wife? How could the two emperors not be enraged?

The elder was also enraged. He was more so unable to accept Ling Han’s behavior.

Ling Han had appeared mighty and proud just then, yet he had suddenly turned around and spat, “Battle ya mom”. Was he still an elite? How could he utter such vile and base things?

He was seething with anger as he threw another punch. A black light orb that was as large as a human burst from his fist. This light orb was pure black, and it radiated with a boundless aura of death. It was as if one would instantly lose their vitality if they came into contact with this black light orb.

“Five Aggregates Destruction!” the elder roared proudly. This was a technique that he had created himself after receiving inspiration from some ancient technique. In the past, this technique had only possessed the power of four aggregates. However, he had forcefully imbued it with the power of the fifth aggregate, raising its power significantly.

Like before, Ling Han responded by activating Tide of the Ages. This was a celestial technique that was extremely effective for both attack and defense.

Of course, the most important thing was that Ling Han possessed a physique that was almost as tough as Level 12 Godly metal. As such, he could withstand the remaining power of the elder’s attacks that Tide of the Ages couldn’t completely dissipate.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. At the end of the day, he wasn’t a member of the Ding Clan, so there was no way he could grasp Tide of the Ages comprehensively. Perhaps he could fully master this celestial secret technique after he advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier. Now, however, his grasp of this celestial technique was still slightly inferior to the members of the Ding Clan’s.

One had to realize that in Ding Yaolong’s hands, this technique had been able to overcome a barrier of two entire minor levels.

While he was sighing with emotion, the Eternity Sky Emperor, Jade Drop Emperor, and the others were all feeling more and more shocked. So be it if Ling Han had only blocked one or two strikes from the elder. However, he still appeared extremely energetic and spirited as if he could battle on for another eight or 10 years.

They couldn’t waste any more time. Although Empress Luan Xing was still locked in seclusion, who could say when she would exit seclusion?

Even if she hadn’t broken through to the pinnacle level, her normal battle prowess was still incredibly powerful. In fact, the two emperors wouldn’t be able to contain her even if they teamed up against her.

Now... was their best chance!

“Attack together! Capture that brat and shatter the stone door!” the Eternity Sky Emperor commanded in a booming voice.

Nearby, the Jade Drop Emperor also issued an identical command.

The 100 or so Heavenly Body Tier elites instantly leaped into action, all of them launching a flurry of relentless attacks at Ling Han.

How could Ling Han block these attacks?

He couldn’t!

Qu Qiuxue and the others were all plunged into despair. Right now, Ling Han’s only option was to bow his head and surrender. There were several elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier here, and Ling Han had struggled to deal with even just one of them. So, what could he do now?

However, a cold smile appeared on Ling Han’s face.

Weng!

He unleashed heaven’s might before throwing an arm out and tossing a handful of Flying Fire Pills toward his enemies.

Not one Flying Fire Pill, but a handful of Flying Fire Pills!

Those who possessed a lower cultivation level than Ling Han were all crushed into the ground by the formidable power of heaven’s might. Meanwhile, even those at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier had grave expressions on their faces. Their power had been suppressed by two entire stars.

It was also at this moment that the Flying Fire Pills exploded.

These were Level 10 Divine Pills. Moreover, they weren’t pills refined for ingesting, but rather pills refined for use as weapons. Rather than calling them alchemical pills, it would probably be more accurate to call them explosive pills. These were pills that could severely wound even elites at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han hadn’t tossed just a single explosive pill, but rather a handful of explosive pills. What kind of concept was this?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Dozens of Flying Fire Pill exploded in the air, the power that they unleashed much alike the full power attacks of several dozen elites at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. This naturally caused a devastating shock wave to sweep through the garden. Even though the Left Minister and the others were standing far away, they were still lifted into the air by the powerful air currents generated by the explosion.

Even they were affected as such, so it was only natural that the targets of Ling Han’s attacks were affected much, much more. Seven Heavenly Body Tier elites were instantly killed, while another 17 received severe wounds, and 21 received minor wounds.

This astounding feat was worthy of being recorded in the history books. It was truly an earth-shattering achievement.

“Ling!! Han!!” The Eternity Sky Emperor couldn’t help but spit out Ling Han’s name in fury. Compared to the Jade Drop Majestic Empire, his Eternity Sky Majestic Empire had received much more damage. Moreover, Ling Han had already caused chaos in the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire 20 or so years ago, killing several Heavenly Body Tier elites. Thus, this sudden turn of events was naturally more insult to their injury.

“The f*ck are you screaming?!” Ling Han scolded, not holding back in the least.
