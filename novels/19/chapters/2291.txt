Chapter 2292: Strange Wrist Guard

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

A mere Genesis Tier Demonic Beast was nothing but trash before a Fifth Severance monarch tier. It was ripped apart by a single roar.

“My wolf! My wolf!” the youth exclaimed as he crawled up from the floor. There was a bleeding wound on his lower abdomen, yet he didn’t pay any heed to this. Instead, he was dazed as he stared at the remains of the wolf with a dejected expression.

“Give me my wolf back!” the youth shouted. His daze suddenly transformed into fury, and he instantly tuned around to yell at the monarch tier.

The monarch tier was extremely displeased. Just what kind of status did he possess? Yet, a mere Fifth Lotus cultivator dared to yell at him? Absolutely ludicrous! He raised a hand and pointed at the youth. Even if he didn’t kill him, he would give him a bitter lesson.

Ling Han chuckled as he casually waved a hand.

Peng!

‘The monarch tier was instantly sent flying.

“He’s still a youth, and you indeed destroyed his spoils of battle. Is chiding you wrong?”

Bewitching Maiden Rou was increasingly familiar with Ling Han, and she immediately stepped forward to say, “Little brother, tell this older sister, why were you engaged in such a risky hunt?”

She practiced charm techniques, so she could subdue others without lifting a single finger. Even though her cultivation had been suppressed to the Fifth Severance, she had still advanced to become a monarch tier, after all. This allowed her to become stronger against those at the same cultivation level.

Moreover, the youth was only at the Genesis Tier, so he more so couldn’t resist her charm techniques.

The youth felt as if the woman before him was as beautiful as a holy saint. He involuntarily wanted to obey her words, and he replied, “Today’s my coming of age ceremony, so I need to hunt prey that’s stronger than me. That way, I can prove my worth to join the hunting team.”

“What’s your name? And where are you from?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“My name is Yong Qin,” the youth replied. Intoxicated, he then said, “I’m from the Mahan Tribe. Big sister, you’re so beautiful.”

A proud smile involuntarily spread across Bewitching Maiden Rou’s face. The youth’s final remark certainly wasn’t because of her charm techniques. Instead, he truly found her beautiful from the bottom of his heart. This praise made her extremely happy.

“Big sister, I’ll give you 10 items of prey to ask for marriage. Will you marry me?” Yong Qin asked. He surprisingly started to propose.

Everyone involuntarily laughed. This youth was truly interesting.

Bewitching Maiden Rou wore a proud expression as she said, “I’m already married.”

Disappointment instantly washed over Yong Qin’s face. It was as if his life had lost all meaning.

“Young man, can you show me your wrist guard?” Ling Han asked. He gazed at the wrist guard on the youth’s forearm.

An alert expression instantly spread across Yong Qin’s face. “What are you trying to do? That’s right, who are you people?”

He had actually revealed his identity in a daze. How uncanny!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “We’re not bad people. You can completely trust us.”

Yong Qin naturally wouldn’t believe him. His expression remained skeptical.

“Little brother, you need to trust us,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said. There was a glimmer in her eyes.

Yong Qin involuntarily nodded. “This wrist guard can’t be removed. Unless I die.”

Ling Han was astonished. He grabbed the youth’s hand, and carefully observed the wrist guard.

Just then, the youth had been able to kill the wolf thanks to his tactic of purposefully fleeing to encourage an attack from the wolf, At the last moment, he launched a sudden strike to gain the upper hand. However, another reason for his success was this wrist guard, which suddenly glowed with a brilliant

light the moment that he attacked. It bestowed him with more power.

However, unlike the treasures that Ling Han was familiar with, this wrist guard wasn’t decorated with any tool symbols. Even though there were patterns, these were simply decorations. This made him feel extremely curious.

Others weren’t as observative as him. After all, Ling Han had acted as the ruler of a heaven and earth for a period of time. Thus, he was now extremely sensitive to changes in power and Regulations.

In any case, even if the others noticed this detail, they wouldn’t pay any heed to it. That was simply a tool at the Fifth Lotus, so how could it catch their attention?

Ling Han carefully observed the wrist guard. Apart from being exquisitely beautiful, there was nothing else special about it. He became even more curious. He used his divine sense to observe its internals, yet this immediately led to an unforeseen accident. With a crack, the wrist guard suddenly shattered

apart before falling from the young man’s wrist.

“ah!” Yong Qin exclaimed in astonishment. His expression became dejected, and he shouted, “My wrist guard! My wrist guard!” His shouts were filled with grief.

‘With the wrist guard falling to the ground, it was easy to see the needle-sized hole on the young man’s wrist. However, Genesis Tier cultivators possessed decent recovery ability, so it wasn’t long before this wound disappeared.

This wound had most likely been left by the wrist guard.

The youth had stated that his wrist guard couldn’t be removed unless he was killed. Perhaps this needle-sized wound was what the wrist guard used to “observe” his life force?

Ling Han let Bewitching Maiden Rou console the youth. Meanwhile, he picked up the broken wrist guard, and started to carefully examine it. He was immediately astonished by the intricate nature of its internals. It was filled with thin threads, though these threads had already been messed up now.

It was as if… the precious tool had self-destructed.

Forbidding others from observing its construction?

Ling Han pondered for a brief moment. His strength was far above the upper limit of this wrist guard, so when his divine sense entered it, the wrist guard was naturally unable to resist. This most likely activated its self-destruct mechanism.

Strange… Far too strange. If this precious tool had a Tool Spirit, was the most important thing not to protect its own life? Why would it choose to self-destruct?

Meanwhile, the youth stopped his fit thanks to the comforting words of Bewitching Maiden Rou. However, he still wore an ashen expression.

According to him, precious treasures like this wrist guard were extremely valuable in his tribe. They were symbols of status. If they were destroyed, their owners would also be belittled and disdained by the rest of the tribe.

Ling Han was extremely interested, and he said, “Let’s go and take a look at his tribe.”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others didn’t have any better suggestions, so they nodded in agreement after exchanging a few glances.

They set off with the youth. However, they only arrived at the camp described by the youth after traveling for three days. It was a collection of tents that were placed in a circular shape.

Several days ago, the youth had left by himself to hunt a wild beast that was stronger than him. This was in order to complete his coming of age ceremony.

“Yong Qin!” someone shouted. There was a woman standing at the entrance of the camp, and she started waving at the youth from very far away.

“Mom!” the youth exclaimed. He also waved his hand as he ran toward the woman.

“Son, you didn’t get injured, did you?” the woman asked as she embraced the youth. She looked him up and down with a caring expression.

“Mom, I’m fine,” Yong Qin said. It was clear that he was slightly embarrassed before everyone else.

“Wh-where’s your wrist guard?” the woman immediately exclaimed upon noticing its disappearance.

“That’s a long story,” Ling Han said as he walked over.

“Who are you people?” the woman asked with an alert expression. She was surprisingly at the Sixth Lotus, though she had only reached the First Leaf. She didn’t have a wrist guard, but she instead wore a shoulder guard. At this moment, it was already glowing with a faint light.

This was most likely a precious tool similar to the youth’s wrist guard.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and replied, “Outsiders who accidentally arrived here.”

This woman was a pure demon. With this in mind, the youth’s father was most likely a member of the Angel Race. After all, he was a “mixed-blood” child.

‘As they spoke, more members of the tribe had already wandered over. They all stared at Ling Han and the others, and they were each holding an iron trident. Moreover, they were all wearing helmets, chest plates, knee guards, wrist guards, and similar types of precious tools.

They all wore cautious expressions.
