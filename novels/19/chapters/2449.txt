Chapter 2450: Insect Queen

Weng, series of sound waves assaulted, and it was incredibly terrifying.

This time, the insects were all prepared. The moment Ling Han appeared, they would have already moved. If Ling Han did not parry them, he would only be sent flying by the sound waves. If he made a move in defense, his speed would definitely be impeded, allowing the winged insect an opportunity for escape.

They had become smarter!

Ling Han was stunned. He had attempted to communicate with these insects before, but had only discovered chaos on the other end. They were completely without intelligence.

Now they actually knew how to attack to get their companion out of a crisis. How could their intelligence possibly grow so much in such a short few days’ time?

Ling Han did not believe this. There should be an insect that truly possessed intelligence that was communicating among them, gathering this pile of scattered sand into a united body. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

To defeat the enemy, the chief had to be captured first.

A thought streaked through his mind. If the insect king could be killed, then this sea of insects might collapse.

But with so many insects, where was he supposed to find a single insect kind? Furthermore, since the insect king had intelligence, it would definitely keep itself hidden. How could it be so easily discovered?

Weng, weng, weng.?The sound waves were already approaching.

Ling Han put aside the thoughts in his mind. He definitely could not miss this chance. Otherwise, when the insects managed to deal with his sudden attacks, the chances of success would be even lower afterwards. He moved, and boundless light of Time spread out.

The wave of attack came to an abrupt halt, as if time had stopped.

Ling Han directly barged over.?Kuang, the sound wave was destroyed, turning into solid shards that fell down, as if a crystal had been shattered.

......

Xiu, Ling Han’s figure soared over them. That winged insect had also been affected by the flow of time, its speed becoming overwhelmingly slow. It was just opening its mouth in Ling Han’s direction, a sneaky arrow already ready to be released, emanating an eerily dark luster.

Ling Han released a battle cry, sending out a punch that crashed towards the throat of that winged insect.

Pu!

Visibly, the end of an arrow pierced right through the back of the neck of that insect, but it immediately shattered. It was formed by Regulations, and now that the winged insect had died, it naturally could no longer keep the form of the arrow that had been formed by Regulations.

Ling Han’s attack had succeeded, and he immediately retreated. He felt like he was completely spent.

Previously, he had channeled the Regulations of Time with his full energy, practically expending himself completely. If it were not for the fact that his Body Art was incredibly frightening, he would definitely have flopped onto the ground by now.

He had clearly just increased the might of time flow by 20% to 30%, yet the Source Power he had expended had increased in tons. This quality-price ratio was really pitifully low. But for better or worse, he had succeeded, which pleased Ling Han greatly. Like a god of war, he charged back to his own ranks.

With him killing two winged insects in a row, even those insects seemed to gain some fear. However, this only made their counterattack become even more berserk as they poured out towards Ling Han like a tsunami wave.

Ling Han had been injured, but he did not channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. It had to be used at the most crucial moment.

No insect could stop him. When Ling Han barged back to his own team, his whole body was bathed in green blood, which emanated an incredibly horrible stench.

Huo Furong pressed down a palm. Green flames flickered, rapidly evaporating that blood, but slivers of grayish substance steamed out. The smell of it would turn anyone dizzy as they would feel a discomfort that could not be described.

Ling Han flopped down, and hurriedly began to recuperate.

Even Huo Furong nodded, and said, “Later, you can rest a while longer. I will take over for you the work that should be yours!”

Ling Han had killed two winged insects, greatly lightening the pressure on the team. This merit was something that no one could compare to.

Ling Han was not reserved, either. Though he still had endless stamina, who knew what kind of monster would emerge from the insect nest? It was still better to be careful and keep his strength at a high level.

Naturally, no one expressed disagreement with Huo Furong’s arrangements. The threat of the winged insects was something that they had all seen. Moreover, Ling Han had also killed countless multi-legged insects and horned insects.

The remaining two winged insects both showed hints of fear. They seemed to still possess survival instinct, and treasured their lives more. They both flapped their wings, and retreated behind the lines. They attacked only when they had reached a farther location.

In this manner, the threat they posed had become considerably smaller.

Everyone was holding on strongly, but there seemed to be no end to the sea of insects.No matter how much blood pooled on the ground from the insects they killed, they were still endless.

“This isn’t a good way!” Everyone’s expression changed.

They could still hold on, but the situation was becoming worse. That was because there was more and more poison collecting in their bodies. The effects on their battle prowess was also becoming greater.

“Hold on!” Jia Lan’s hands formed a strange sign.?Xiu, a shadow suddenly flew out of her body, and floated into the depths of the insect cave. It was visible, but wasn’t actually solid. A great many insects were clearly attacking it, yet it seemed like it did not exist.

“Divine Shadow Skill?” Huo Furong nodded. “This is the best technique for scouting enemies. Even if they discover it, they can do nothing to stop it. It has form but is not solid, like a shadow doppelganger that the heaven and earth has taken form in.”

After a while, Jia Lan’s figure trembled, and she suddenly snapped her eyes open.

Her expression was filled with shock. “There is an insect queen that is endlessly laying eggs, so fast that it is no slower than us killing them!”

Everyone was stunned. No wonder these insects couldn’t be killed completely no matter how hard the group killed them. That was because there was an insect queen that was laying eggs at a shocking rate.

“In other words, there is no way that we can completely kill all these insects,” Ji Wuming said grimly.

“There’s only one solution!” Huo Furong continued.

Ling Han nodded. “We need to kill the insect queen.”

But just how difficult would it be to kill the insect queen?

They needed to go against the flow, charge right towards that insect queen, and only then would they have a chance to make their move.

It was something that could be explained easily with a few words, but to actually do it?

Everyone looked at the insects that were flooding towards them from all directions like seawater, and felt a sense of helplessness rise up in their hearts. F***, this was too hard.

“This is our only way out!”

“We have to do it!”

But they were all Monarch Stars, and had willpower that could not be matched. Immediately, they firmed their resolve.

“Die!”

No longer did they choose the strategy of half their members resting while the other half stayed on defense. Instead, they moved out all at once, going against the flow of the sea of insects.

This was really too hard.

The sea of insects was endless. Every step forwards required a bloody battle, expending an astonishing amount of energy.

At this moment, who else would dare to hold anything back? They all used powerful moves.

Divine light shone blindingly as they forcefully boosted themselves to Celestial King Tier battle prowess. This allowed them to become unmatched.?Peng, peng, peng, it was as if they were an invincible spear, piercing through the waves and forging onwards while charging towards the innermost depths of the insect cave.

Meanwhile, Ling Han weighed the Heaven and Earth Origin Stars in his hand. They had always been just a weapon to serve as an intimidation tactic. By the look of things, today was the day that they would finally show their might.

They charged once more into the insect cave. Instantly, space enlarged countless folds over, with attacks rushing towards them from all directions.

“Where is the insect queen?” everyone asked. This place was enshrouded in darkness, and they couldn’t see very far at all.

Jia Lan pointed at that mountain peak ahead of them.

“Where exactly?” everyone asked hurriedly. They, too, could guess that the insect queen was on the mountain, but they needed to know a more exact position. Otherwise, how were they supposed to kill it?

Jia Lan’s expression was a little astounded. He was still pointing at the mountain, and said, “That is the insect queen.”

Everyone faltered at first, then realization dawned on them, and they all inhaled sharply.

The mountain that they had seen was actually not a real mountain, but the insect queen itself!

No wonder its rate of laying eggs was actually capable of catching up with the rate at which they killed the insects. It was around the size of a mountain, so it was definitely very fertile.

Just how were they supposed to kill such a massive monster? Where were its vital points?
