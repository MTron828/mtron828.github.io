Involuntarily, the bearded man couldn’t help but feel his heart go cold. He had not taken Ling Han to heart at all, but who would have thought that the latter would have such terrifying strength. With just a move, he had been captured as easily as blowing off dust.

Just when he saw how Ling Han’s gaze became vicious, he couldn’t help but shiver, and answer, “I’ll talk! I’ll talk! It’s our gang leader that told me to come.”

“Oh, and who is your gang leader?” Ling Han asked smilingly. As he spoke, he clapped the bearded man’s shoulder with each word. With every clap on his shoulder, the bearded man couldn’t help but inhale sharply and exclaim in pain, his forehead producing cold sweat.

“Our gang leader is Mao Haitao,” the bearded man answered very simply and directly.

Ling Han gave an “oh,” and asked, “It can’t be that your gang leader has gone crazy for no reason, and ordered that you people come and cause trouble, right?”

The bearded man answered, “It’s Liu Jun, Young Master Jun that sought out our gang leader, and asked that the gang leader step out for him to cause some trouble for the Rain Emperor.”

“Oh, and who is this Liu Jun?” Ling Han was slightly intrigued.

“Young Master Jun…” The bearded man dragged out his words, his whole person becoming smug, as if he was a completely changed person. However, when Ling Han clapped a hand on his shoulder, he immediately behaved, and answered, “Young Master Jun is a disciple of the Saintly Origin Academy!” When he spoke the words “Saintly Origin Academy,” even his eyes had grown bright.

To the majority of residents of the Celestial Realm, Ninth Heaven Celestial King was naturally the strongest existence in the world, and the Saintly Origin Academy that had been founded by more than 20 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings naturally was overwhelmingly awesome too. Any person that could enroll into the academy had to be a top-tier prodigy, and would definitely become a mighty figure in future.

This Liu Jun was a disciple of Saintly Origin Academy, and naturally revered like a god by the bearded man.

“Is he very strong?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

Those prodigies like Yan Xianlu would definitely be qualified to enroll into Saintly Origin Academy, but they clearly were not the same level as Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, and the others, so which category did this Liu Jun belong to?

“Young Master Jun is from the Alchemy Institution. At a young age, he is already a Three-Star Alchemist, and has even attained Fourth Refinement in terms of sect brothers. It is said that he would definitely be able to achieve Fifth Refinement within the next 100 years, and become a Four-Star Alchemist!” The bearded man boasted on behalf of Liu Jun, as if Liu Jun was his brother or son.

Alchemist?

Ling Han suddenly understood why Liu Jun was targeting the Rain Imperial Pavilion. It was probably connected to alchemy.

“Then do you know why Liu Jun wants you to do this?”

The bearded man nodded, and replied, “Young Master Jun has his eye on the location of the Rain Imperial Pavilion, and wants to buy this place to open up his own pharmacy, but the owner of this place refused. Thus, Young Master Jun came up with this way, wanting to chase that owner away.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but smirk coldly. The Rain Emperor naturally would not be selling the store here; this was the place for them brothers to reunite!

“Go back and tell that whatever Young Master Jun to personally come and make his apologies within the next three days. Additionally, don’t forget to pay for the losses experienced here. Even one less Star Stone would not be permitted.” Ling Han turned back to the people in the shop. “Everyone should be quite angered, right? Come, just act as you will. If any of them dares to fight back, I’ll slaughter him!”

He then looked towards those ruffians, and wherever his eyes passed, those people would be trembling all over, as if their very souls were about to explode.

The staff in the shop all exchanged looks for a while. At the beginning, none of them moved, but one of the braver ones finally walked out.?Peng, peng, peng.?Grabbing hold of one of the gang, he thrashed him harshly.

True enough, that person did not dare to resist at all. He only used his arms to protect his head, and then bent his legs in to avoid any hits to vital areas.

Seeing the situation, the remaining staff also became braver. Gradually, they all came out, and beat them up.

Being beaten up for no reason, who would not be angered? Previously, it was because they were outmatched, but now that they had someone to back them up, their internal fury naturally could be vented completely.

When these staff had thrashed them to their hearts’ content, Ling Han finally let the bearded man and his group leave.

All the staff were looking at Ling Han with admiring expressions, and felt like this man was practically a god to them.

Ling Han’s face bore a slight smile, and he even deliberately took out some alchemical pills, which he distributed among them so that they could heal their injuries.

As he saw it, this was not just a place for him and the Rain Emperor to meet up, but could really be used as an actual alchemical pill pharmacy in the future because he himself was an alchemy prodigy.

The Saintly Origin Academy had gathered the most outstanding prodigies of the entire Celestial Realm, and there were also as many as 22 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings as their backers, so it would definitely attract a great many people over. Furthermore, those prodigies that enrolled into the academy would naturally be backed by various great sects as well. This was practically uniting all the great forces of the entire Celestial Realm in one place.

It could be foreseen that this place would eventually become a very prosperous location, which would naturally give rise to endless business opportunities, representing a boundless wealth.

At present, Ling Han still placed a high importance on wealth. It could not be helped. The Divine Demon Sword was still only a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool. If he wanted to improve it further, he would naturally need a great amount of Level 20 Godly metal. This was all money, and the sum was incredibly terrifying.

The fact that this place had caught Liu Jun’s eye meant that it was a fortuitous location, so in the future, Ling Han would toss the alchemical pills that he had concocted here, and it naturally could bring an extremely great amount of wealth to him.

He had never been one to suffer losses quietly. Since Liu Jun caused such a mess in this place, then he had to pay compensation. There would be no exception for him.

In merely half a day’s time, the Rain Emperor had returned.

“Fourth Brother!”

“Second Brother!”

The Rain Emperor laughed loudly, striding over from the entrance. His aura surged like an incredibly terrifying ocean.

“Congratulations, Second Brother, you have successfully advanced to Heaven Soul!” Ling Han smiled, clasping his hands.

The Rain Emperor smiled, and pulled Ling Han with him up the stairs. He brewed a pot of tea, and shared some tea with Ling Han.

The two of them chatted for a while. Though the Rain Emperor had advanced into the Heaven Soul, it had not been for a long time. Furthermore, there were only Time Cultivation Chambers with 200x time acceleration effects in Lishui City. He had not even reached the peak stage of the Heaven Soul, so he naturally could not have formed the nine divided souls.

Ling Han related his plans, and the Rain Emperor naturally would not make any objection. He merely told Ling Han to do as he willed, and then entered into the Black Tower. He wanted to form nine divided souls as soon as possible.

The Rain Emperor began to cultivate, and Ling Han summoned all the women. They then settled down in the Rain Imperial Pavilion. Then, they began to wait patiently for the arrival of that Young Master Jun.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, but that Young Master Jun had still not appeared, right until the fourth day…

A worker ran up, and reported, “Young Master Lin, it’s not good. Someone is blocking our doors, and demanding to see the person in charge of the shop.”

Ling Han was just sipping tea with the Empress. They had all cultivated Dividing Soul Tier to a practically flawless extent, so there would be no meaning to go into seclusion for further comprehension. Next, they had to wait for the opening of an Immortal Palace Tier Mystery Realm, and then enter into it for their breakthrough to the Immortal Palace Tier.

Hence, they were all extremely idle now. Ling Han had placed his focus on alchemy as the doors to Seventh Refinement would be opening to him at any moment.

“They’re here?” Ling Han said smilingly to the Empress. At present, his alias was Han Lin, and he had also altered his appearance slightly. With the Heaven Deceiving Technique, which he had attained Great Accomplishment in, concealing his aura, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would find it very difficult to distinguish his true appearance if they did not observe him closely.

The Empress had also used the Heaven Deceiving Technique to alter her own appearance and aura. Though she was still captivatingly beautiful, she was not as stunningly exquisite as she had been. She nodded.. “We’ll know when we go downstairs and look for ourselves.”
