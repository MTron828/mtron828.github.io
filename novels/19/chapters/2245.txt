Chapter 2246: A helping hand

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was a very young man who had clear-cut features, and was filled with an air of robust heroism.

His attire was plain, merely ordinary blue long robes, yet he naturally had an air that could make others fall into submission before him.

At first, he had still been in the distance, but in the time needed for a mere few blinks of the eye, he had already arrived within the proximity.

“Ailean!”

The members of the Celestial Realm faltered for a moment before looking excited as they cheered loudly.

Ailean, a Monarch Star of the Celestial Realm. He was rumored to have advanced into the Immortal Palace Tier at a far earlier time than Ji Wuming and the others.

Gaddalon’s eyes swept over him, looking slightly serious.

There was a mysterious feeling that elites would have about other elites. Ailean made him instinctively sense that the former was very strong.

However, what was stronger was his confidence and contempt. “Coward, so you have finally dared to appear for a battle?”

“Hehe, killing you would be as easy as killing a dog; what need is there for such arrogance?” Ailean stated calmly, and even flicked the corners of his robes, as if the other was merely a speck of dust that was completely beneath his notice.

“How dare you!” the people of the Foreign Realm all shouted loudly.

Gaddalon merely smiled. “Do you only know how to boast?”

“Then make your move, and I will let you know what the immensity of heaven and earth means!” Ailean declared.

“I will oblige you!” Gaddalon moved decisively.?Xiu, before everyone’s eyes could catch sight of him, he had already charged in front of Ailean, and shot out a punch. Instantly, the heaven and earth seemed to lose all color, as if about to prostrate in front of him.

Peng!

Ailean also responded with a punch of his own. The two fists had not yet collided when the power of Regulation wrapped around their fists had already clashed, creating a boundlessly majestic light, which was like a sun, and could be seen from 5000 km away.

Usually, after trading a blow, both sides would step back, and then find another chance for attack.

However, neither of them had any intention to withdraw their fists at all. Instead, they pushed their fists onwards towards the other.

Both were very fast, but every step they took would create a loud sound like thunder, and those people below who were beneath the Immortal Palace Tier were completely dizzy from it.

Too strong; so this was Monarch Stars!

Finally, the two fists slowly crashed towards one another. At this moment, an even more brilliant light burst out, as if the universe had exploded. Even though everyone had their eyes open, it was like they were blind, and they could not see anything at all.

After a long while, the light finally dimmed, and Ailean and Gaddalon were revealed to be standing 30 meters away from each other. Both of them had crossed their arms behind their backs, and made no further movement.

Everyone was astonished. Just now, they had not been able to see anything at all, and their divine sense had also been blocked. If either Ailean or Gaddalon had made a move to attack them, they would not even have known how they had died.

A slight breeze blew over, and the robes of the two great Monarch Stars fluttered slightly.

“So you have cultivated to the eighth level of Eighth Lotus, not bad, not bad,” Gaddalon spoke up, not withholding his praise of Ailean.

Ailean similarly very calmly answered, “We are both in the same boat.”

Eighth level of Eighth Lotus, what cultivation level was that equivalent to?

Most people were completely baffled, but some descendants and heirs of Eighth Heaven and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings understood. The fifth level of Eighth Lotus corresponded to the Fifth Secret of the Immortal Palace Tier, and from the sixth level onwards, it corresponded to the sixth secret palace!

This was the pinnacle level of the Immortal Palace Tier, and there were pitifully few that could cultivate to this level. Furthermore, at least more than half would only be able to cultivate to the Sixth Secret and Seventh Secret. The number that could complete the pinnacle level Eleventh Secret could be counted on one hand.

Monarch Stars were Monarch Stars, after all. They could reach the pinnacle level of every cultivation level, and others could only envy them.

“However, I will not need 100 moves to kill you,” Gaddalon declared calmly, filled with confidence. “Firstly, the overall level of our dimension is higher than yours. In a battle of equal levels, I will be able to overwhelm any one of you. Secondly, there are no Regulations here that you can draw replenishment from, but I have originated from a stronger dimension. In a situation where Regulations are equal, my battle prowess will be stronger!”

“You can just boast as you like,” Ailean said disdainfully. “I only decide with my fists.”

“Haha, then I shall send you on your way to the afterlife!”

Gaddalon charged out again, multiple seals glowing on his crimson red skin. He had entered his strongest state.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ailean was unafraid. He, too, used celestial techniques, and his whole person had become a ball of moving water. Every drop was as heavy as a star, and was capable of destroying everything.

Water was the gentlest, but was also the toughest.

Ailean’s grasp of Regulation of Water had clearly reached an astonishing extent. Thousands of drops of water traversed space, which was incredibly terrifying.

Neither of the great Monarch Stars had any intention of dragging out the battle; they merely blasted at each other.

100 moves, 200 moves, 300 moves. The speed of their blows was just too high, and various amazing techniques were pouring out, such that others could only exclaim in shock. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Everyone was gasping in amazement, and even those from the Foreign Realm could not help but be impressed by Ailean’s strength. This was indeed an amazing character. If he could go and develop further at the Foreign Realm, his future prospects would be boundless!

Though the Rare Earth Dimension was also a low-level dimension, its level was superior to the Celestial Realm’s. Being able to cultivate his battle prowess to such a frightening level in this kind of “barren and impoverished place,” if he went to the Rare Earth Dimension, where power of Regulation was even stronger, his strength would naturally be able to progress further.

In fact, it could even be claimed that Gaddalon was actually inferior to Ailean.

But who asked him to be born in the Celestial Realm? This had limited his potential and strength.

Though the two great Monarch Stars had been boasting at the beginning, in truth, their strength was actually extremely close. The battle was not decided even after 700 moves. However, their clash was really too intense, causing a great expense of the power of Regulation within their bodies, and both were beginning to look strained.

“Gaddalon, he is merely trash from a super low-level dimension. You still haven’t managed to deal with him after so long?” A voice rang out slowly, and a large, fat figure suddenly appeared.

This… What was this thing?

A fat insect, looking like a worm and 30 meters long, while its width was about 12 meters, and possessing a large number of tiny white legs, appeared. Its head had two massive eyes that were incredibly beautiful like crystals.

Gaddalon’s fists suddenly shook, sending Ailean back. Then he turned his head and glanced, asking, “Yamu, what are you doing here?”

“Lady Yamu!” Seeing this gigantic worm, at least half the people of the Foreign Realm knelt on one knee, paying their respects to it.

Yamu, that giant insect, smirked coldly. Upon closer look, it actually possessed extremely feminine expressions, and the mental voice it emanated was also inclining towards femininity. This should be a female insect.

Her many legs moved simultaneously as her body wriggled forwards. With every sweep of a leg, she would be advancing at least several hundred km. Her movements zigzagged, and pained cries rang out. She had actually charged right into the crowds, and wherever she passed, she would actually be swallowing multiple members of the Celestial Realm.

After she had devoured several dozen people, she finally answered, “You are too inefficient. I have come to replace you!”

Gaddalon was furious, and exclaimed, “I can deal with it; there is no need for your nosiness!”

“Is that right?” Yamu’s eyes became fixed on Ailean. “This human is not bad; I want to eat him!”

Meanwhile, Ailean’s expression was solemn. This female bug was a Monarch Star that was in no way inferior to Gaddalon. If they were battling outside, then even if he was outmatched, he would not have to worry about any threat to his life, but in this place, the power of Regulation in his body was already close to running out, but Yamu was completely energized.

If they battled, his circumstances would become extremely dangerous.

But how could it be that he had to surrender the Origin Magic Cube, and flee on his own, abandoning the many people that were still here?

Every person of the Celestial Realm had a solemn expression as well. They naturally could tell just how dangerous their situation was. Two Monarch Stars had actually come from the Foreign Realm.

“Brother Ai, do you need a helping hand?” Right at this moment, a voice rang out, and a masked person appeared quietly.
