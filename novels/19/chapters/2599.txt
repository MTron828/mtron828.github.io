Chapter 2600: Entering the tomb

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The others followed suit, and entered the ancient tomb as well.

Though this burial mound looked like a hill from the outside, the passageway inside was only wide enough for around five people to pass through at the same time. Its height was around three meters, with stairs that led all the way down.

This was clearly a hill-like burial mound, but why were the stairs going downwards?

Everyone did not know what the reason was. In any case, this staircase was designed just like this, and their only option was to just walk onwards.

It was very dark here, but it did not affect their visibility. As long as there weren’t any unique Regulations in place, pure darkness had completely no effect on Celestial Kings.

There were a particularly large number of turns here. The staircase was only about 30 meters long at most, and then it was the end. They had to take a turn and continue downwards. After walking for a while, they suddenly stopped, and saw traces of blood on the ground.

“Celestial King blood,” they immediately said.

Celestial King blood was too unique, bearing a unique kind of pressure. Celestial Kings naturally could distinguish it with a single glance.

A battle had taken place here, and a Celestial King had bled.

Immediately, a strong feeling of alertness rose up in them. Had the Celestial King wounded here been attacked by someone else, or… by “something” here?

Inside an ancient tomb, it was possible that there were traps, formations, and monsters. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If you were careless and rash in here, there would be no point in blaming others even if you really did die. You were purely asking for it.

A few more turns later, there were more and more smears of blood on the ground. In fact, there were even cut-off limbs. The scene was extremely bloody.

“En?” Ling Han stopped, and picked up a few strands of black hair. This hair was very coarse, and definitely did not belong to a human.

The Yin River Celestial King stopped suddenly, and said very impatiently, “Don’t just stand around there. Let’s go quickly.”

In the first place, he was already angered, and now Ling Han was actually loitering around here, which displeased him greatly.

“What’s so interesting about it? Isn’t it just a few strands of hair?” a Celestial King asked. This was one of the Yin River Celestial King’s lackeys. Since his master was angered now, he naturally had to take the chance to perform.

“Don’t think that you have discovered some kind of clue. There are many beast-type Celestial Kings,” another Celestial King said.

Ling Han ignored them, and merely looked at the black hairs in his hands. They gave him a very strange feeling.

“I was talking to you!” The two Celestial Kings that had previously rebuked him moved at the same time, grabbing out at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually pressed down a hand.?Peng, peng, the two of them were sent flying backwards, crashing heavily into the wall. Instantly, blood spurted madly from their mouths as half the bones in their bodies were shattered.

“How dare you!!” the Yin River Celestial King immediately shouted. Ling Han was nothing but one of Zhao Shuang’s lackeys, and he actually dared to attack his people. This was too outrageously bold.

“This way!” someone suddenly called out, his tone filled with slight urgency.

Everyone walked ahead, and saw that a small platform appeared ahead of a few steps on the staircase. There were strange seals drawn on the ground, and it seemed like a formation.

Dead bodies lay all over this place.

Actually, not many people had died, but this platform itself was not very large. Hence, now that there were five or six corpses lying around, especially when they had been ripped into pieces that were scattered here and there, they covered the whole platform entirely.

Aside from this, there was also a bear-like monster. It was completely covered in black fur, and even had tentacles. It looked extremely disgusting.

“These are the people who had entered this place the earliest.” The Yin River Celestial King did not have the time to call Ling Han to accounts. He frowned. Though he had only seen these people once, with the memory of a Celestial King, he naturally would not forget anything or anyone he had seen before.

“They encountered this monster, then after sacrificing the lives of a few people, they still managed to kill it,” Yang Xiaoling also analyzed from the sidelines.

Ling Han tossed out the black hairs in his hands, and they just happened to land beside that monster. In comparison, one would realize that these black hairs had definitely come from this monster.

“The battle was extremely intense.”

“However, though we entered very late, our delay was also limited, yet already so many people have died here.”

“This monster should be very vicious. With an ambush, it wounded one person, then it continued to retreat as it fought, and the great battle only took place here. After killing these people, it also killed itself.”

Everyone made their deductions, and had just about reconstructed the truth of the matter.

“Where did this monster pop out from?” Zhao Shuang asked, his voice shaking. He was but a Second Heaven Celestial King. If he encountered a sudden attack from this kind of monster, wouldn’t he be just simply killed?

“We are not the first group. The ambushes that lie ahead should have already been activated,” the Yin River Celestial King said. Entering later had its benefits as well, for there would be people who entered earlier helping them to avoid the traps ahead.

He glanced at Ling Han, and did not continue to flip out. This place was already exuding an air of great danger, so it was not appropriate to cause internal strife at this point in time. It would not be too late to deal with this person in the future.

“Follow me, and be careful!”

He led the way ahead, and everyone followed behind him.

It was very dark and dead silent in here. Whether it was their breathing or their footsteps, only the slightest effort could cause a very large sound.

They continued to make turns endlessly. Not too long later, they discovered traces of another battle. Dismembered limbs lay all over, and they discovered the corpse of another black-furred bear monster not too far ahead.

Near here, there was another small platform, and there were formation patterns drawn on it as well. However, none of them could recognize what it was.

“It seems like the appearance of this kind of monster is related to this platform.” None of them were stupid, and they immediately came to this deduction.

They continued to advance, and true enough, the third place where a battle had taken place was still nearby a platform.

Some of them wanted to give up. It was too dangerous here, and even Celestial Kings had bled. They did not feel safe at all.

They were all second-generation young masters, and knew how to contend with each other for their pride, but they had a greater fear of death. Who among them had really suffered before, and how many of them would truly have roamed the border between life and death before?

Yet the Yin River Celestial King did not agree. He was filled with enthusiasm, determined to find the fated opportunity here.

After walking for a while longer, they came to another small platform after a turn, but there were staircases heading downwards on either side of the small platform. In other words, there was now a fork in the path.

Everyone looked towards the Yin River Celestial King to see what he would say.

“We go right.” He chose a path.

They went through the stairway on the right, and there was another fork in the path not long after.

“We’ll take right again,” the Yin River Celestial King squeezed out through clenched teeth.

Forks in the path appeared endlessly, as if this was a labyrinth. However, everyone did not feel any changes in space. Thus, it should be that this was just a situation wherein there were a lot of forked paths, and not a genuine labyrinth. Otherwise, that would be too easy to break through.

After a considerably long time, they finally reached the end. A burial chamber appeared here, and compared with the small hill-like burial mounds outside, it was pitifully small, but it was still the size of an average house.

Right in the center of the burial chamber, there lay a stone casket. There wasn’t the slightest bit of dust on this casket.

“Could it be that we have just bumped into the fated opportunity like this?” Everyone exclaimed in shock. Ordinarily, if there were any opportunities inside a burial chamber, that would definitely have to be funerary objects. Those definitely had to be located inside the coffin.

“We open the casket!” the Yin River Celestial King declared without any hesitation.

To them, a dead Celestial King would also be fertilizer, so how could they possibly have any reservations about disturbing the dead?

“I’ll do it!” A Second Heaven Celestial King leaped out, immediately going to open the casket.

He had just laid his hand on the casket when?weng, the whole stone casket suddenly shone. A seal lit up, blasting towards that Celestial King.

“Suppress!” that Second Heaven Celestial King roared, throwing a punch to meet the blast of the seal.

Peng!

The might of this seal was extraordinarily great. With a single strike, that Second Heaven Celestial King was sent flying, and he crashed heavily into the wall. A fountain of bloody mist gushed out, and he fell from the wall. In an instant, he had become extremely weak.
