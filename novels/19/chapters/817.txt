“Me?” Yi Shuang Shuang giggled. “I am naturally the Number One Beauty of this world!”

“Nonsense, that’s Niu!” Hu Niu mumbled from below. However, at this moment, no one would pay attention to what she was saying.

The Beast Snake King stared fixedly at Yi Shuang Shuang as if he could distinguish something just from looking at her. After quite a while, he finally said, “I will definitely take away this man with me today.”

“Then you will have to prepare, for you will be leaving your life here,” Yi Shuang Shuang said casually. Even when facing a being like the Beast Snake King, she was still very casual. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But the calmer she was, the more the Beast Snake King dared not be careless.

In the past, he would definitely be very confident, but with the appearance of the Purple Moon Empire, he finally knew what the words “in the wider world, there would always be people more talented” meant. Merely the Eight Kings were enough to thrash them fully.

This woman... could she also be some old monster from some era long past?

Yi Shuang Shuang could not help but raise a brow, and asked, “Are you guessing internally that I am an old monster from some past era?”

F***, you f****** really are a monster, ah! the Beast Snake King exclaimed inside his heart. A slight change of expression appeared on his face unconsciously.

“You actually dare to call me an old monster, you damn earthworm, you’re really asking to be beaten!” Yi Shuang Shuang was infuriated, and immediately shot towards the Beast Snake King.

The Beast Snake King dared not be careless, and quickly became serious, stepping up to receive her.

Peng, peng, peng . As the two battled, they continued to soar up into the skies. Thus, though the shock waves from the battle were still gushing out wildly, they managed to miss the area the Imperial Capital was in. Ling Han nodded quietly. It looked like Yi Shuang Shuang did not just know how to fool around.

He leaped up, and watched the battle from a nearby location.

In this world, aside from others at the Shattering Void Tier, only he was qualified to watch the exchange of blows between two Shattering Void Tier elites at a near distance.

“Fight, fight!” Hu Niu appeared beside him, clapping her little hands.

... Right, he forgot that there was still a little monster.

After a few moves, the Beast Snake King looked somber, but was reassured internally.

She was indeed very strong, and not the slightest bit inferior to him. However, she was not stronger than him.

After all, there were still more ordinary people in this world. Maniacs like those in the Purple Moon Empire were, after all, not commonplace.

“Your Honor, I admit that you are indeed very strong. However, you are still not qualified to stand against the five sects. I advise you to stop while you can. Otherwise, all your lifetime’s cultivation will become wasted effort!” the Beast Snake King advised.

The battle prowess of both parties were about equal. In a battle to the death, either of them could die. Additionally, he was still waiting to enter into the Immortal Realm after the Reckoning and become an Immortal. With such a wonderful future ahead of him, how could he be willing to die?

“Hahahaha, ignorant fool. I didn’t show my might, and you really think you’re something awesome, don’t you?” Yi Shuang Shuang asked, smiling. She bared her teeth, and two blood-colored wings instantly appeared behind her back.

No, no, no. They should not really be considered wings. They had neither feathers nor scales, but rather were very thin wings made of flesh, similar to a bat’s.

“You, you, who exactly are you?” The Beast Snake King was no longer calm. The moment she spread out her wings, her aura instantly spiked wildly, immediately dominating over his.

This caused him to recall the Lunar King and the others. Instantly, a powerful shadow arose inside his heart. He had been dealing with those eight freaks these few days, so even if he wanted to forget them, he was not able to.

“You think you’re worthy to know?” Yi Shuang Shuang asked disdainfully. She struck out with a palm, and all of a sudden, uncountable stars fell from the skies. A hole was actually ripped in the skies.

Fifteen Stars of battle prowess, definitely fifteen Stars!

Without a second word, the Beast Snake King turned around directly and fled.

In the Shattering Void Tier, a gap of a single Star would mean the difference between heaven and earth. That would mean definite defeat of the weaker party. Moreover, his battle prowess was only twelve Stars, which meant a gap of whole three Stars of battle prowess. That would mean she could easily dominate him with a mere flip of her hand.

Flee, flee, flee!

He returned to the battleship, and hurriedly stimulated the vessel into movement whilst turning on its defenses. With him, as well as the defenses of the Absolute Saber, they should probably be able to cut out a path of blood for their survival.

Yi Shuang Shuang had no plan to pursue him, either. She withdrew her wings and gave a lazy stretch, showing off her attractive figure in full view.

Hu Niu pouted. With a frown, she said, “Vixen!” What she hated the most were those women who had shapely figures showing off in front of her.

Ling Han pointed at the battleship in front of them, and asked, “Why aren’t you pursuing?”

“I only promised to help you watch over your home, but never said I would be fighting off robbers for you.” Yi Shuang Shuang giggled. Changing the topic, she said, “If you want me to move, it’s not impossible, but what benefits would you give me?”

“We’re friends, so wouldn’t mentioning benefits be too dirty?” Ling Han asked in a righteous tone.

“Pei, don’t try this trick with me. If you tell me all your secrets, I can move and level whatever five sects and Purple Moon Empire to the ground. How about it?” Yi Shuang Shuang offered temptingly.

Ling Han gave a ‘ha’, and retorted, “In your dreams. The five sects have such strong foundations, so who knows how many more awesome characters they still have. As for the Purple Moon Empire, though Fatty Ma has never acted before, his power should be frighteningly strong to be able to command the Eight Kings.”

“I’m also very powerful, all right?” Yi Shuang Shuang countered, displeased.

“Your current battle prowess is, at most, only fifteen Stars. And you want to sweep aside all opposition in the world? Difficult!” Ling Han shook his head.After another few years, perhaps Helian Tianyun will be able to return to the peak, and with twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, I’ll ask you again if you will be afraid?

Yi Shuang Shuang humphed, and said, “If I had not been restricted by this realm, and if I couldn’t only use ten thousandth of my abilities, that would be enough to sweep through this whole realm!”

“Isn’t that nonsense? There are so many in the Immortal Realm, and any of the immortals would be able to do so, so there is no need to trouble you.”

A vein popped on Yi Shuang Shuang’s forehead, and she exclaimed, “Brat, do you believe I will thrash you first? Don’t think that just because you have a tough physique, I don’t have ways to refine high-grade well-tempered steel into soft matter!”

Ling Han did not plan to provoke this demonic woman too much, either, and said, “Hehe, the weather is not too bad today. Nice breeze and warm sun. Let’s just have some tea.”

“Tea is not nice, let’s eat meat!” Hu Niu immediately piped up.

Yi Shuang Shuang could not help but laugh, and said, “For Hu Niu’s sake, I won’t bother to drop to your level. However, you’d better note down in a little book how many times have I helped you so far. You will have to repay the favor in future!”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “People always say you should never wish for your kindness to be repaid. Why is your understanding so poor?”

“You don’t like it? Come bite me!” Yi Shuang Shuang puffed out her chest, and her full breasts instantly surged forth.

“Do not show off your breasts in front of Niu!” Hu Niu was anxious. Why did all of them have to pick on her small size!?

“What?”

The three of them were just planning to descend to the ground when they saw a carriage coming from afar. However, it was not travelling on the ground, but rather in the air. The being drawing the carriage was actually a Demonic Beast of the Shattering Void Tier. It had the shape of a lion, and the aura it exuded was enough to make the world crack.

Yi Shuang Shuang immediately frowned. This time, a powerful enemy had come!

Her eyes passed over that Demonic Beast in the Shattering Void Tier as if she could see through the obstruction and see directly into the carriage. The person sitting within was the real powerful enemy.
