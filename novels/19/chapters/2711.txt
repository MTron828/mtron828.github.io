2712 Ling Han has done a great merit

“No…”

Ma Feng released a roar of fury, his black locks fluttering wildly. He looked like a lion that was raging.

Flames of fury were spitting from his eyes. He only had one son, and this son was also very outstanding. It was not impossible that his son would be able to surpass himself in the future.

Yet, his son had been killed right in front of him.

He wanted to kill! He wanted to kill! He wanted to kill!

“Don’t think you’re going to die so easily. I will make you suffer an epoch’s worth of torture before I finally crush you to bits!” Ma Feng roared furiously. He attacked in his anger, wanting to take Ling Han down.

“Hehe, in your dreams.” Ling Han stepped forwards without fear.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two elites with Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess exchanged blows, and this instantly caused excessive destruction.

“Let’s take this battle into the skies!” Ling Han shot up into the skies first.

“You can’t escape!” Ma Feng hurriedly set off in pursuit.

When they were in the air, the two great elites continued to exchange blows. This time, they no longer had to hold anything back, and could release all the restrictions on them, battling to their hearts’ content.

However, the longer they battled, the more shocked the people beneath them were.

Ling Han was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

“He can already match a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate when he is only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Heavens, this is really unbelievable.”

“Just how has he been cultivating?”

“Throughout the ages, he should be the strongest Ninth Heaven there ever was.”

But there were some that were rejoicing in Ling Han’s misfortune. Filled with jealousy, they said, “Hehe, no matter how freakish he is, so what? Killing a disciple of the martial academy is a death sentence. Best-case scenario, he would have to be thrown into the Celestial King Graveyard, and stay there till he dies of old age.”

“Maybe not. With how freakish Ling Han is, who knows, he might be able to convince the martial academy to be lenient?” someone else said.

“I feel that Ling Han is too rash. Why wouldn’t he wait? Once he left the martial academy, or in fact, as long as he killed him outside the martial academy, there would be no need to worry about this problem.”

“That’s right. Committing murder in the martial academy, and right in front of Ma Feng at that. This would be too hard for him to get out of.”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly, while the battle in the skies was also incredibly intense.

Peng, peng, peng. A series of intense exchanges later, Ling Han had been struck a consecutive 17 times, and his whole person had also been sent flying.

It had to be admitted that Ma Feng, as a veteran Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate—one that had battled countless years in the Realm Battlefield at that—truly had incomparable battle prowess. Even if you added He Yufeng and Yun Haoyang together, he would still be 10 times stronger than them.

However, when Ling Han steadied himself, over a dozen grooves had appeared on him, but they were like the grooves that were created when a child tried to punch holes in dough. They merely collapsed inward, and did not break at all. Naturally, there wouldn’t be a drop of blood seeping out.

And it was practically just an instant before these grooves were filled up by themselves, rapidly recovering.

At first, Ma Feng had been extremely certain, but after seeing this scene, his eyes almost bulged out in shock.

What kind of monstrous physique was this?

Those watching them from below were also stunned. Was this a second Heavenborn?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “It is not that easy to kill me!”

Everyone was speechless. This was no longer a matter of whether it was easy or difficult, but rather if it was really possible to kill him.

Ma Feng took a deep breath. His son’s body hadn’t even cooled completely, and the enemy who had killed his son was standing right in front of him. How could he stop at this moment?

“I don’t believe that you can maintain this state forever!” He thought that this was Ling Han having used some kind of secret technique. It definitely could not be maintained constantly.

“Just try it then.” Ling Han grinned.

Ma Feng did not say anything else, and charged towards him again.

Peng, peng, peng! The two of them battled fiercely. Indeed, Ma Feng was strong, and had suppressed Ling Han, continuously landing attacks on him, but faced with that monstrous defense of Ling Han, he had absolutely no way to deal with it.

If Ling Han’s strength wasn’t that great, he could suppress Ling Han first, and then use his superior power, added with Regulations, to slowly refine him. Even Divine Metal could not hold up against that.

The problem here was that Ling Han’s battle prowess had also reached the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Furthermore, he was very strong at that, and this made Ma Feng extremely exasperated. What chance would he have to slowly refine Ling Han?

Moreover, Ling Han had not drawn the Divine Demon Sword yet. Otherwise, once the Heavenly Venerate Tool released its might, it would be a different tale of who would be at the advantage, and who would be at the disadvantage.

Everyone watching from below was already numb with shock. They could only look at the skies dumbly, stunned by how strong Ling Han’s battle prowess and recovery ability could be.

One day, two days, and three days passed, yet the battle between the two great elites still did not end.

“That’s about enough.” A voice rang out calmly, yet bore supreme authority.

…The Heavenly Venerate that was stationed at the martial academy had spoken.

Ma Feng stopped his attack, and called out, “Lord Universe Dragon, this boy has publicly killed his fellow disciple in the martial academy. Please act, My Lord. Capture him, and leave his punishment to me!”

A Second Tier Heavenly Venerate had spoken, so he dared not ignore these words.

To Ma Feng, this was actually very embarrassing. A great, dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was actually unable to take down a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and he actually needed someone to help him? This would make others roar in laughter.

But who asked Ling Han to kill his son? There was absolutely no way Ma Feng could allow Ling Han to leave alive.

Beneath them, everyone was also shaking their head and sighing. It should be known that the martial academy had its rules. Even if Ling Han was incredibly freakish, only his life would be spared, at best. He would still be sent to the Celestial King Graveyard—it was fine even if it was destroyed as it could be rebuilt.

Who asked Ling Han to kill Ma Yuhai? Furthermore, it was right in the martial academy, and right in full public at that!

There was definitely no way for Ling Han out of this.

Ling Han did not speak, and merely descended from the skies.

Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate did not speak, either, and maintained his silence.

Ma Feng became frantic. What was going on here? Could it be that the Heavenly Venerate was going to cover for Ling Han? He hurriedly exclaimed, “My Lord, I have fought bloody battles in the Realm Battlefield, and who knows how many times I have sustained heavy injury, and there were even times when I was close to death. Yet now, my son was killed right in front of me. If this matter was known to others, wouldn’t it bitterly disappoint all those who are fighting fiercely at the front lines?”

This was an attempt to garner pity, but at the same, it was also a threat. If justice could not be done in this matter, what mood would those elites that were still battling furiously, bathed in blood, have to continue fighting?

“Ma Feng, you have indeed sweated and bled for the Genesis World,” the Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate said. “However, that is all. Ling Han has done a great merit for the Genesis World. Your son insulted him, and this is a great wrong, a serious crime.

“Even though Ling Han killed your son now, his merit has still far surpassed the crime that he has committed. I will not make a move on him, and it will be the same for other Heavenly Venerates as well.”

‘What?!’

Hearing these words from the Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate, everyone was stunned.

Exactly what great merit had Ling Han done that he would actually be granted such favorable treatment? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He could still go unpunished despite having killed the son of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

This was natural. Ling Han had dealt with tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. How could that be something that a single Ma Feng could compare to? However, this news had not spread out yet. Otherwise, the whole martial academy would be singing Ling Han’s praises.

“I don’t believe it! No way!” After a moment of surprise, Ma Feng immediately shouted loudly, his head held high. “What great merit would a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King be able to achieve? Even if he has Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess, so what? Just how many more great merits would he have done than I? It should be known that I have been battling at the Realm Battlefield for several hundred billion years!”

“Whether you believe it or otherwise has nothing to do with me. If you still do not stop, I will take you down, and throw you out of the martial academy.” The voice of the Universe Dragon Heavenly Venerate rang out. He still did not show himself, but his tone was filled with dominance.

So what if it was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate? In front of a true Heavenly Venerate, they were worth even less than nothing.
