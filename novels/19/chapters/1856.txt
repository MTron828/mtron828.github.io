Chapter 1857: Here comes trouble

“Liu Yu, it can’t be that you were really , right?” Sun Dong paused. Looking at his awkward posture, it really looked like that was the case.

After all, though he had never men before, he had played with a considerable number of women. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Immediately, Liu Yu’s face flushed red, and an incredibly furious expression flashed over his face.

“Hahahaha!” Sun Dong suddenly burst into laughter, not giving the slightest consideration for Liu Yu’s feelings.

In the brothel, the others did not dare to laugh out loud. They all covered their mouths, suppressing their amusement with much difficulty.

“Liu Yu, I really couldn’t tell that you are so hardcore with your games!” Sun Dong tsked. This naturally was not a compliment for the former.

Liu Yu hurriedly said, “Young Master Dong, you have misunderstood. I was bullied!”

“What, it really was a ?” Sun Dong glanced over Liu Yu. Then, he released his grip on the two women. Walking to the latter’s side, he pulled down Liu Yu’s pants in a single move, and then inhaled sharply.

Not only him, all the other people in the brothel were also stunned.

Damn, this was too fierce, wasn’t it? His a*s was so severely wounded, so how big would that thing have to be?

“F***, and I thought mine was already big enough, but compared with this, it’s still not good enough!” Sun Dong felt hurt. Men would always be very concerned about this aspect. Though everyone practically would not have the opportunity to compare their sizes, when they had the chance for an unusual contest, they would still be unable to control themselves from comparing amongst themselves.

Those women in the brothel were all astounded. With how thick that was, none of them could take it. It was definite that they would be destroyed.

“No, no!” Liu Yu wanted to die already when having so many people look at him with such strange expressions. “It’s not human. No, no, no, no, my a*s wasn’t stabbed by anyone, but rather by a bamboo pole.”

Sun Dong faltered for a moment, and then laughed out loud. He patted Liu Yu’s shoulder, and said, “I have previously underestimated you. With you being such a wild player, you can follow me in future, I will accept you as my lackey.”

“Young Master Dong, you have to avenge me!” Liu Yu had abandoned his pride, and explained all that had previously happened. However, he naturally would not say that it was he who had been overbearing at first, but had rather sketched over the details. The main focus of his explanation was the beauty of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the tyrannical ways of Ling Han.

“Oh?” Sun Dong was interested now. “In this Alchemy City, there is actually someone so arrogant? Also, are you sure that that woman is really as beautiful as you say?”

“She can only be more beautiful than I have described!” Liu Yu guaranteed.

Sun Dong snapped his fingers, and said, “Come, take me there.”

Liu Yu was delighted, and hurriedly led Sun Dong out the doors.

However, when they had arrived, Ling Han had long since entered into the cultivation chamber. It should be known that this place was opened by powerful figures from the fourth level, or even the fifth level. Sun Dong would never dare to break open the doors to find Ling Han.

Thus, when he made his careful enquiries, and found out that Ling Han had rented the cultivation chamber for a month’s time, he returned to have his fun at the brothel. He would come again after a month passed.

***

In the cultivation chamber, Ling Han took out his cauldron, and began to concoct alchemical pills.

Though the lowest grade of Celestial pill needed Celestial medicine, it did not need a very large amount. Only a little bit of Celestial medicine was needed as the main ingredient, while the rest could all use Saintly medicine as supplementary ingredients. Of course, the more Celestial medicine was included, the higher the grade of the completed pill would be. This was definite.

Ling Han had just begun, so he naturally wouldn’t use too much Celestial medicine in a single attempt. He was destined to fail. He was only going to sum up his experience from failure, and improve the success rate for the next attempt.

After gathering the wealth of so many Holy Sons and Holy Daughters in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, he really was quite rich at present. He had as many as four Celestial medicines, and three of them had come from Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng.

As they were descendants of Celestial King Tier-level forces, their wealth was indeed astonishing. However, Celestial medicines also had different grades, which was something determined by their age. Furthermore, they also had different attributes. Time and Space Celestial medicines would definitely be much more valuable than others.

A higher grade or lower grade was not so important. What was most important was that alchemical pills could be concocted from them.

Ling Han took out a Celestial medicine, and carefully sliced off a piece. He tossed it into the cauldron, and then he immediately began pill concoction using the Nine Heavens Flame as a heat source for the cauldron.

Speaking of the conditions of pill concoction, Ling Han was stronger than 99% of alchemists because he had the Nine Heavens Flame!

The most important factor in pill concoction was flame control, and the Nine Heavens Flame was one of the Nine Great Ancestral Flames. No alchemist could possibly have better endowments than Ling Han. They could only match him, and furthermore, there could only be eight at most that had matching conditions.

...And how many of them would be alchemists among them? Perhaps not even a single one.

Boom, the Nine Heavens Flame burned furiously. Ling Han continuously threw supplementary ingredients into the cauldron. There was no need for him to be stingy about this. Saintly medicine was really too cheap in the Celestial Realm. It could be found everywhere.

After a month, pa, the cauldron exploded.

Failure.

Ling Han stopped, entered into the Black Tower, and thought back over it underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

The acceleration of time could not be overlapped with the Reincarnation Tree. However, since this was him reviewing a problem, it was definitely the Reincarnation Tree that was the better option.

“There is no problem with my methods. At most, I am only lacking practice a bit. The problem now instead is the cauldron.

“The Nine Heavens Flame is too powerful, and the cauldron will not be able to withstand it.

“And if I still have to attend to the cauldron too, it will definitely increase the difficulty. I will have to divide part of my concentration.

“I have to get a better cauldron. Good tools are a prerequisite to the successful execution of a job; the people from ancient times were right.”

However, he did not have an excellent cauldron now, so Ling Han could only take out a cauldron again, and continue his journey of alchemy.

Two months later, pa, the cauldron exploded once more.

Ling Han reviewed for a while, and then started again.

This time, he had failed after only half a month. Even if he was the Alchemy Emperor, if he wanted to advance into the level of Celestial pill, his path was still covered with thorns. However, this did not discourage Ling Han. Instead, a strong fighting spirit rose up in him.

It would be more interesting if there was a challenge.

He tirelessly concocted alchemical pills. However, five months’ time very soon passed, and the doors of the cultivation chamber automatically opened.

‘One month has passed outside. My application to enter into the second level should be approved by now, and I can just go to the second level to access a cultivation chamber with a better time acceleration rate. In that way, I will have the certainty to become a Celestial level alchemist in a year, or even less time than that.’

Ling Han was quite satisfied. After all, any One-Star Alchemist would have to be troubled by this step for at least 10,000,000 years’ time. This speed of his was really astonishing, but who asked him to own the Reincarnation Tree?

He rose up and left. However, he had just walked out the doors when he saw that there were two people standing guard outside. Upon a single look, he could tell that they were there for him.

Liu Yu!

Ling Han did not recognize the other person, nor was he interested to find out.

“Brat!” The moment Liu Yu spotted Ling Han, he immediately began gritting his teeth. Even by now, his a*s hadn’t completely recovered yet. Who asked Ling Han to have used a sliver of power of Regulation when he had stabbed him? At least for a few months, he would have to grit his teeth in pain every time he squatted.

Ling Han glanced at him, and couldn’t help but smilingly ask, “Is Mr An*s all right?”

‘All right your sister! You actually have the nerve to ask!’

Liu Yu was so furious he wanted to commit murder. However, he knew that he was no match for Ling Han, and hurriedly said to Sun Dong, “Young Master Dong, just see, just see. Isn’t this brat so arrogant that everyone is below his notice? Even if you are here, he is also still arrogant, and completely does not take you seriously at all.”

Sun Dong was wanton and unrestrained. Though he was wearing long robes, his chest was broadly exposed, showing a dense growth of chest hair. He glanced coldly at Ling Han. “Brat, are you looking down on me?”
