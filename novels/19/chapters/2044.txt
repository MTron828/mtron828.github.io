Chapter 2045: Stimulating the dragon bridges

Fu Yue also went to stimulate the dragon bridges. After a while, five dragon bridges lit up at the same time.

Ling Han had already witnessed it many times over. Ordinary cultivators could only stimulate a single dragon bridge, while king tiers could stimulate at least two, but it would only be three at most. As for emperor tiers, the number of dragon bridges they could stimulate at the same time would be between four to six.

Meanwhile, monarch tiers would be able to stimulate between seven to nine, and when the number reached nine, it would lead to a qualitative change, gaining the approval of a golden dragon bridge.

Fu Yue could stimulate five dragon bridges at the same time. This kind of natural talent would rank him above average among emperor tiers, which was considerably good.

Fu Yue turned around, and said to Ling Han, “Brother Ling, I’m leaving first.” Then, stepping on a dragon bridge, he strode off.

On the other side, the four great monarch tiers stared at each other for a while, and then began to stimulate their own dragon bridges respectively.

“Since I was the first to arrive, I will be the one to get the ball rolling.” Tian Qingyue walked out. He began to stimulate the dragon bridges.

This attracted the attention of the others, and they all looked over.

“Tian Qingyue… Can he stimulate the golden dragon bridge?”

“He probably can. If even the super monarch tiers ranked in the top three couldn’t do so, that would be much too inexcusable.”

“That is not definite. The Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm would open every 100,000,000 years, but is it definite that there would be someone that could stimulate the golden dragon bridges? On the contrary, it is instead more frequent that no one is capable of stimulating the golden dragon bridges.”

“But Tian Qingyue is different. He will definitely be able to.”

“That’s right. He will definitely be able to!”

The majority were filled with confidence in Tian Qingyue, and thought that he would definitely be capable of stimulating the golden dragon bridges.

Weng, an ordinary dragon bridge lit up, and then it was followed by another, and then came the third, and the fourth.

This naturally was within everyone’s expectations. Monarch tiers would be able to stimulate seven dragon bridges at least, and with Tian Qingyue’s strength as a supreme monarch tier, it was completely no problem for him to be capable of stimulating eight dragon bridges.

The key was whether he could stimulate the ninth, and cause a qualitative change.

When the eighth also lit up, everyone’s eyes widened as they involuntarily became anxious.

Would he… really be able to do it?

After only a while, the ninth ordinary dragon bridge lit up, and then all nine dragon bridges dimmed at the same time. At the same time, a golden dragon bridge shone with majestic brilliance, the nine dragons entwined on it seeming to come alive while exuding a terrifying aura.

This was the intimidating pressure of the Celestial King Tier, and even top-grade monarch tiers could not bear it, their faces paling.

However, Tian Qingyue was completely unaffected. It was as if he could be spared from this kind of pressure now that he had gained the approval of the dragon bridge.

“As expected of Tian Qingyue!”

“Heavens, the golden dragon bridge approved of him.”

“This has to be dated back to the last time the golden dragon bridge was opened, or how many years ago has the last time been?”

“It has to be at least a dozen hundred million years ago.”

Everyone was looking at Tian Qingyue with admiring gazes. This man had created a miracle.

“Everyone, I will take my leave first.” Tian Qingyue laughed loudly. He was also relieved.

Though he had powerful self-confidence, the golden dragon bridges were really too hard to stimulate. Now that one had finally approved of him, he finally released the breath he had been holding, and his confidence also multiplied by a hundredfold.

Only a mere 300-odd people had managed to stimulate a golden dragon bridge in a whole epoch, and among these 300-plus people, even those with the lowest accomplishments had still reached the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier! And he was also going to become one of these 300-plus people. He would be able to become a Fifth Heaven Celestial King at the very least.

No, the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier was definitely not his finishing line. His target was the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier!

Xia Houtong also stood up quickly. Moving the Regulations inside his body instantly caused ordinary dragon bridges to light up one after another. When he reached the eighth, it seemed to lag, and the ninth seemed like it would not light up no matter what.

“Is Xia Houtong unable to stimulate the ninth dragon bridge?”

“If he cannot do so, he will be left behind by Tian Qingyue in future.”

“It cannot be helped. The ninth bridge is too hard to stimulate. This is a deciding barrier, and it is extremely difficult for even top-grade monarch tiers to breach this.”

“Sigh!”

And just when everyone was lamenting, they saw that the ninth dragon bridge had suddenly lit up. Then, the light of the nine dragon bridges was extinguished, leaving behind only a single golden dragon bridge that was flickering with light.

“Heavens, Xia Houtong has also stimulated a golden dragon bridge!”

“Two ultimate prodigies!”

“Indeed, it is the legend that top-grade prodigies would normally not appear, but if they did, they would come in pairs, or even threes and fours. It is absolutely true.”

“However, ultimately, only a single monarch tier would be able to attain the pinnacle, while the others would only become stepping stones.”

“The more top-grade prodigies that appear at the same time, the more astonishing the height the monarch tier that manages to attain the pinnacle can reach. The Great Eastern Celestial King of our Universal Peace Heaven finally became an Eighth Heaven Celestial King because there had been three competitors that were evenly matched with him.”

“If Yu Huaqing and Zhu Huiyun can both stimulate golden dragon bridges, then it will be four monarch tiers contesting for the best. In the future, it is highly possible that another Eighth Heaven Celestial King will appear!”

Everyone discussed spiritedly, and then turned their expectant gazes on Yu Huaqing and Zhu Huiyun.

Now, the pressure was on the two of them.

The two great monarch tiers walked out at the same time, and began stimulating the dragon bridges.

They had not disappointed the expectations of the masses, and two golden dragon bridges lit up at the same time.

This time, everyone erupted into uproar. After a few hundred billion years, the miracle of four golden dragon bridges appearing at the same time had finally reappeared. This meant that another Eighth Heaven Celestial King would appear in the Universal Peace Heaven.

The two great monarch tiers released a battle cry at the same time, and walked along their respective bridges. Though it was destined that one of the four of them would attain the pinnacle, exactly who it would be was only a show in the eyes of others, but for them, it was incredibly important.

None of them wanted to go no farther than the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

Now that the four great monarch tiers had left, everyone’s interest dropped. They were no longer interested in just watching, and approached respectively, stimulating their own dragon bridges.

“Niu is going too!” Hu Niu jumped out, going to stimulate the dragon bridges.

At first, Ling Han had planned to have everyone drawn into the Black Tower so that they could all move together. However, upon further thought, he felt that every person would have their own individual fortune. If he safeguarded everyone by his side, they would be indeed safe, yet it would also cause them to lose the fortune that they should have had.

With this thought, he no longer advised them against moving alone.

One, two, three, the dragon bridges lit up one after another, and very soon, the number reached as many as eight.

In Ling Han’s eyes, this could not be more ordinary, and this was definitely not Hu Niu’s finishing line. She was the sole direct heiress of the Roc Palace, and was one that had obtained the brand of martial intent from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at that, so how could she be inferior to Tian Qingyue, Xia Houtong, and the rest of them?

However, this caused huge waves of commotion among the masses.

“What? Someone actually stimulated eight dragon bridges!”

“Which monarch tier is this?”

“Don’t know. It’s a young girl, and she is outrageously beautiful!”

Everyone was watching Hu Niu, and they were all conquered by her pure exquisiteness. At the same time, they were also stunned by Hu Niu’s strength. She was able to stimulate eight dragon bridges. This was something that only a monarch tier could do, and it had to be a super monarch tier at that.

Weng, only after a slight pause, the ninth golden bridge lit up, and then all nine bridges dimmed. In their place, a golden dragon bridge lit up.

Heavens!

Everyone was holding their heads in shock, their mouths wide open in shock, but they could not utter a single word.

The fifth golden dragon bridge had lit up! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was a new record in history. Before this, only four super monarch tiers had appeared at most, unlocking four golden dragon bridges.

A contest between five monarchs. In the end, would a Ninth Heaven Celestial King emerge from them?

“Ling Han, Niu’s going first!” Hu Niu turned around and waved back at Ling Han. Then, she took out a chicken drumstick, which she chewed on as she walked forwards. Compared to Tian Qingyue and the others previously, she looked so relaxed as if she was here on vacation.

Ling Han nodded with a smile, and then he heard the Empress declare, “I’m going!”
