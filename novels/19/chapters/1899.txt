Chapter 1900: An aggressive counter

“Don’t even think about it!” Completely flustered, Lu Jin suddenly jumped up, pointing a finger at Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

If he really was exiled from Alchemy City, that would become an eternal stain that would never be washed away. He would be jeered and laughed at wherever he went.

Alchemist Zi Cheng ignored him completely, and only looked towards Grandmaster Chu Ye and Grandmaster Wen Tian. “What do the two of you say?” His expression was filled with austere ice, his air overbearing, having an indescribable domineering aura.

Who said that he was only versed in alchemy?

Everyone was overwhelmed by Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s aura, and felt their hearts tremble as their scalps grew numb.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was really bold to proclaim discarding a Four-Star Alchemist just like that.

It should be known that on the surface, there were only four Four-Star Alchemists in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm, and every one of them was an influential supreme existence that could affect a whole region. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Brother Zi Cheng, you are the chairperson of Alchemy City, so it is natural that whatever you say goes.” Grandmaster Chu Ye took a sip of wine, appearing to be very unperturbed. However, he added, “Alchemy City has always had only three Four-Star Alchemists, and that was fine.”

What he implied was agreement. Having us three Four-Star Alchemists was enough, and there was no need for a treacherous guy like this.

Grandmaster Wen Tian, meanwhile, was expressionless. He was an unusual character, and thought about things in a way different from the norm. He replied, “Agreed.”

Aside from new alchemical pills, there were not many matters that could capture his interest. Whether there was another Four-Star Alchemist or one less, so what? He did not care.

Hearing the verbal exchange between these three, everyone felt their mouths twitch, unable to believe what they were hearing.

A Four-Star Alchemist had actually been discharged with just a few words like that. This was practically like it was just a trifling matter!

“Scram!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng pointed at Lu Jin. This time, he was really angered. To actually dare have ideas about his own disciple... It caused this old geezer’s temper to completely explode.

“You cannot exile me! I am a Four-Star Alchemist!” Lu Jin’s face was completely pale as he loudly called out, “You are using your public office to avenge a private grudge! I do not yield! I don’t yield! I won’t yield!”

“So what if you won’t yield?” Grandmaster Zi Cheng scoffed. “So what if I am using my public office to avenge a private grudge?”

He countered with two consecutive questions, striking Lu Jin speechless, making his face astonishingly pallid.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s status in alchemy was really too high. In the past, even a minor alchemy apprentice of his had been able to rampage around in Alchemy City without any reservation, not taking even a Three-Star Alchemist seriously.

Then, Grandmaster Zi Cheng was naturally even more powerful.

Merely in the case of Four-Star Alchemists, he had nurtured three of them. What kind of accomplishment was that?

In the world of alchemy, Grandmaster Zi Cheng was a massive tree that stretched up to the heavens. If it was not for the fact that he lacked a bit of luck, he could even have a chance of becoming a Five-Star Alchemist.

“Hehe, I have to say a word of justice here!” Ba Yao interrupted. The Thundercloud Palace had a secret deal with Lu Jin—the Thundercloud Palace would fully assist Lu Jin’s branch to ascend to the position of chairperson of Alchemy City, and as repayment, Alchemy City would provide the Thundercloud Palace with a great volume of alchemical pills for free or a very favorable price every year.

As for dealing with Ling Han, that was only something to be done while they were at it, just a minor suppression.

Who would have expected that this suppression would actually incite such a strong backlash from Grandmaster Zi Cheng.

“How could a noble Four-Star Alchemist be discharged so easily?” Ba Yao asked solemnly.

“Who do you think you are? What right do you have to speak here?” Alchemist Zi Cheng immediately pointed a finger at Ba Yao, his contempt indescribable.

Who was Zi Cheng?

As the king of Four-Star Alchemists, from a certain aspect, he could be considered a Celestial King himself.

‘No matter how invincible you, Ba Yao, are in the Ascending Origin Tier, can you be considered a Celestial King?

‘You can’t? Then shut your mouth, what right do you have to interrupt me!’

“Scram!” Alchemist Zi Cheng shouted.

Ling Han’s heart rippled. So as it turned out, this master might be a money grubber, but beneath that, he had hidden such a domineering facet to his character. It was just that he usually had no need to be so overbearing that he could override everything. And now that he had been angered, he had finally exploded.

He was also very touched. Grandmaster Zi Cheng had risen in fury because of him. Otherwise, Ba Yao was ultimately a member of a Celestial King Tier-level sect, and he himself was an Ascending Origin Tier elite, so how could he be easily insulted?

Ba Yao’s expression turned cold, and he declared, “Grandmaster Zi Cheng, please be more polite with your words!”

“I will allow you three breaths’ time to scram. Otherwise, I will spare no expense to rally all the elites in this world to begin hunting you down, right until you are dead!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng declared menacingly. “If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try!”

When these words were spoken, Ba Yao’s aura was suddenly completely suppressed.

Invincible in the Ascending Origin Tier?

Hehe, that was just empty words. Among Ascending Origin Tier-level forces, a king tier of the Ascending Origin Tier like him was indeed capable of being invincible, but the Thundercloud Palace was not the only Celestial King Tier-level force in this world.

How could it be that the other Celestial King Tier-level sects did not have Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of the last generation who had cultivated to the Ascending Origin Tier, and could not break through even with much effort, but had tempered their power to become incredibly strong in the Ascending Origin Tier?

A Four-Star Alchemist sparing no expense definitely could take out something that would tempt these elites out, and by then, he would really be in danger.

...The Thundercloud Palace was only a First Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force, and the Eastern Celestial Realm had Second Heaven and Third heaven, Fourth Heaven, and even Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level forces. So what if he was killed? How could it be that the Thundercloud Celestial King would seek them out for revenge?

Just like with that person from the Roc Palace. So what if you were a person that had walked out from the Thundercloud Palace and Zihe Clan, you would still be directly killed without hesitation.

As long as your background was powerful enough, you could be confident enough. When you made a move, you would definitely not be merciful in the slightest.

“One!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng began counting down, his gaze sinister.

“Two!

Ba Yao’s expression changed drastically. Ultimately, he did not dare take a gamble on Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s determination. With a humph and a leap, he had already flown back to the warship in the skies.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng did not cast him a second look, and turned to look at Lu Jin. “You can get lost too!”

“No, you can’t do this, I am a Four-Star Alchemist, I am a Four-Star Alchemist!” Lu Jin shouted loudly, slightly hysterical.

With a wave of his sleeve, Grandmaster Zi Cheng said, “Brother Gu, Brother Chang, Brother Zhao, cast this person out!”

Immediately, three Ascending Origin Tier elites walked out. Aside from alchemists, there were similarly cultivators as well in Alchemy City. They were the pillars of strength that truly protected Alchemy City. As for alchemists, they would definitely be spending the majority of their time on alchemy.

“Brother Lu, please!” these three people said to Lu Jin, their faces expressionless.

When Lu Jin saw this, he knew that there was no turning back in this matter. His hands involuntarily balled into fists, and his heart was filled with regret.

Why didn’t he quit while he was ahead?

Previously, he completely had the upper hand, yet had greedily attempted to follow up and press his attack home. In the end, a heavy blow landed right on top of him. Not only had he lost all his advantageous position, he had in fact lost completely.

Only now did he know just how far the gap was between himself and Grandmaster Zi Cheng. He could not become his equal just by being a Four-Star Alchemist like him.

How regretful he was of his past deeds!

He sighed, turned, and left. His posture was stooped and filled with a despondent air, a completely different picture from how high-spirited he had once been.

Everyone gasped in shock. Everything had changed really too quickly.

At the beginning, merely Lu Jin alone had forced Grandmaster Zi Cheng into a continuous retreat, compelling him to make various compromises. In the end, a strong helper like Ba Yao had come, yet it had instead blown the bugle horn for the beginning of Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s counterattack.

This was probably what they called life being inconstant and prone to change.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng swept an eye over the gathered Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, and saw Lu Xianming was presently trembling in fear. He calmly said, “Three years later, the selection for the heir will continue as planned!”
