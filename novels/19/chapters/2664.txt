2665 Give some face to the Wang Clan

Ling Han’s right hand balled into a fist. Using the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll instantly increased his battle prowess countless times over.

The complete Heavenly Venerate Technique could not be channeled at the same time, because it was too powerful. Before one could use it to hurt others, he would be crushed by the overwhelming power himself first. But against Ma Yuhai, the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was enough.

“With the power of an ant, you actually dare to think you can match me?” Ma Yuhai couldn’t help but sneer. A mere Seventh Heaven Celestial King actually dared to face him head-on; he really had no measure of his own weight!

Ma Yuhai was a supreme monarch star at the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven!

Clang!

The hands of the two men made contact. Instantly, a terrifying shock wave reverberated outwards. It was only an instant, and this abode was completely razed to the ground. Meanwhile, Ma Yuhai’s expression changed rapidly. Pa! His right hand was instantly shattered into bits, and the destruction continued upwards. Pa, pa, pa! His bones broke one after the other, and it only stopped when it reached his shoulder.

Ma Yuhai was furious, shocked, and fearful, all at the same time. Ling Han was clearly just a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. Why was the power he showed so strong? Ma Yuhai actually was not able to withstand a single blow?

This was natural. Ling Han’s battle prowess had already advanced to the Ninth Heaven in the first place, so he wouldn’t be much weaker than Ma Yuhai, and added with the power boost from the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll that compounded his battle prowess countless folds, any Ninth Heaven Celestial King would have to avoid Ling Han. How could they take this blow head-on?

Yet Ma Yuhai had completely considered Ling Han below his notice, and was determined to confront him face-to-face. This was just asking for his own suffering; how could he not be injured in this case?

Pu! Bloody mist spurted out from all over Ma Yuhai’s body, and his whole person collapsed resoundingly.

He wasn’t dead, just knocked out.

Among the rubble, spheres of light vibrated one after another. They clearly were the shields of Source Power that the guests had put up, using Regulations to protect themselves. More importantly, a few Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had stepped out previously, and worked together to take control of the situation. Otherwise, the majority of people here would be wounded and crippled.

Everyone was dumbfounded. This was Ma Yuhai, a supreme monarch star at the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven, and he actually couldn’t even withstand a single blow from Ling Han?!

This was something that they did not even dare to imagine. It was too inconceivable.

Wang Jiayue’s small mouth was also half-gaping, her heart and soul stunned to the extreme.

In her heart, Ma Yuhai was an invincible king. It would only be he who would be defeating a stronger opponent, and there was no one who could match him in the same cultivation level. How could she have possibly imagined that he would actually lose to a Seventh Heaven Celestial King?

That glorious and invincible image of Ma Yuhai immediately collapsed in her eyes.

Ling Han strode forwards, and went to stand next to Ma Yuhai. He raised a foot high, and then suddenly stomped down.

“Ah…” In his great agony, Ma Yuhai was forced to regain consciousness. He realized that his other arm had also been broken under Ling Han’s foot. In fact, there wasn’t even a sliver of flesh or blood left. It was like his arm had been severed.

“Ling Han, you should know when to stop!” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King spoke out, his expression filled with icy seriousness.

He was a powerful figure of the Wang Clan, Wang Yangming. He was a monarch tier, and Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier was the limit of his aptitude. He had no chance of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, but was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier not powerful enough? It was an existence that was invincible against anyone below the Heavenly Venerable Tier!

Wang Yangming could not tolerate Ling Han’s arrogance. It should be known that Ling Han had just destroyed the Wang Clan’s banquet, and was now committing violence right in front of him. Did he really think that Wang Yangming was dead?

Ling Han raised his foot again, aiming it right above Ma Yuhai’s left leg. Only then did he look at Wang Yangming nonchalantly. “What were you saying?”

“Do not attempt to challenge—”

Pa!

Wang Yangming had just spoken when Ling Han’s foot had already stomped down, forcefully crushing Ma Yuhai’s left leg as well.

This was really a frank provocation, causing Wang Yangming’s face to become extremely ugly. His hair fluttered windlessly as his eyes spat icy daggers.

He wanted to make a move, and suppress this outrageously bold villain.

“Hehe, young friend Ling is indeed astonishingly brave!” Another Ninth Heaven Celestial King laughed out loud. “I was not mistaken about you!” He clearly looked to be only in his forties, yet actually called himself an old man1.

“Clan Leader!” Wang Yangming was stunned, and turned towards that person. This was the present clan leader of the Wang Clan, Wang Qianyang, one who had a chance of breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Such a powerful figure would actually speak up for Ling Han?

Ling Han smiled. “It was you who invited me?” With his present strength, he was capable of standing equal even together with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. There was no need for him to have any reservations or be overly polite.

“That is correct. I am Wang Qianyang,” the clan leader of Wang Clan said smilingly. “Young friend Ling, could we have a word?”

Ling Han looked Wang Qianyang over for a while. Though this person was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the feeling he gave off was more than 10 times stronger than Wang Yangming.

He thought for a while, and then said, “Fine. For the sake of the clan leader of Wang Clan, I will spare one of his legs.”

Previously, Ma Yuhai had said that he would cripple one of his arms, so Ling Han decided to break all of his limbs. However, Wang Qianyang clearly had shocking battle prowess, yet still treated him politely, so Ling Han decided to give him some face.

Wang Yangming almost exploded with fury. ‘You, a mere Seventh Heaven Celestial King, think you’re worthy of giving face to the Wang Clan?’

Yet Wang Qianyang laughed loudly, and beckoned a hand at Ling Han. “Young friend Ling, come!”

Ling Han walked over, Wang Qianyang leading the way. The two of them arrived at the summit of this mountain, clearly not wanting others to listen in on their conversation.

Wang Jiayue thought for a moment, and then followed them.

Everyone was hissing sharply, thinking that this Ling Han was really powerful. He struck three times at the banquet of the Wang Clan, and was extremely violent. In fact, he even destroyed the abode belonging to a descendant of the Wang Clan. However, the clan leader of the Wang Clan did not fault Ling Han at all. Instead, he treated him with politeness.

“Hehe, if any of you can defeat Heavenborn, you will definitely be worthy of the same kind of treatment,” someone said slowly.

When these words fell, everyone was struck speechless.

Defeat Heavenborn?

What kind of joke was that? Even the majority of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were incapable of that. It definitely could only be done by one of the big shots like A’mu, Du Shiyi, and the like. But Ling Han achieved this feat when he was only a Seventh Heaven Celestial King. Just for that reason, so what if the Wang Clan treated him like an esteemed guest? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At the summit, Ling Han stood side by side with Wang Qianyang.

“Young friend also studies alchemy?” Wang Qianyang asked with some curiosity. He had been alive for over seven epochs, but he still felt that he did not have enough time. To break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, he was practically in a constant state of seclusion.

Yet Ling Han clearly had astonishing accomplishments in cultivation, so how could he have time to spare on alchemy at the same time?

Ling Han smiled. “It’s not just mere studies. I can concoct all alchemical pills.”

What arrogance!

Wang Qianyang was slightly taken aback, and then burst out laughing. “Young friend Ling is really not the slightest bit modest.”

“I am just telling the truth as it is,” Ling Han answered.

Wang Qianyang nodded. “The reason why I invited you here is because I wish to have a partnership with you in an alchemy business. I am sure that you, young friend, have limited energy, and cannot waste it on pointless miscellaneous matters. Thus, our Wang Clan can take charge of matters like collecting ingredients and selling alchemical pills. All the young friend has to do is concoct alchemical pills.”

“Oh, then how would the profits be shared?” Ling Han did not object. He indeed had no wish to waste his time on miscellaneous matters.

“50-50,” Wang Qianyang replied.

Ling Han only had to concoct alchemical pills, yet could earn 50% of the profits. This seemed to be too profitable for Ling Han, but that was actually not true. Five-Star Alchemists were too rare. Which of them was not extremely outstanding? They basically would not act upon invitation.

Ling Han considered for a while, and then said, “I want Divine Metal.”

Divine Metal!

Wang Qianyang was surprised. With Ling Han’s abilities and power, could it be that he still did not have a Celestial Tool? That was not right; if Ling Han was only lacking a Celestial Tool, he wouldn’t be saying this.

“Your entire share of the profits has to be paid in terms of Divine Metal?”
