Chapter 2125: Overlord of monarch tiers

Though the town was big, everyone was still Severing Mundane Tier elites. Thus, in less than seven or eight minutes, everyone had arrived at the first level of the house Ling Han was staying in.

…This was a three-storey tall building, and Ling Han was staying on the third floor.

“You insolent madman, scram out immediately!” the members of the Liu Clan immediately shouted.

By now, they were filled with confidence.

“The limit of a month has not arrived yet, and you people have already settled your matters?” Ling Han’s voice rang out from upstairs.

“You’re dreaming!”

“Today is the day that you deliver up your head!”

“Hurry and get down to pay your greetings to Lord Holy Son!”

The members of the Liu Clan all demanded at once.

Holy Son?

Ling Han was slightly surprised. He had actually drawn out a Holy Son of the Imperial Void Sect? It looked like the Liu Clan was still quite important. He opened the window, and swept a glance over the gathered masses. Immediately, he focused on Yulan Fenghua.

Such a man that seemed to possess his own halo would be like a crane in a flock of chickens wherever he was, incredibly striking to the eye.

Yulan Fenghua also looked towards Ling Han, his gaze slightly flickering, and revealing a hint of surprise.

He could actually feel a coldness from Ling Han, causing him to feel a slight stab of pain, as if he had encountered a strong enemy.

Was this possible?

Who was he?

Monarch of monarchs, the disciple of Imperial Void Celestial King, the grand-disciple of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. With such a prestigious identity, who else could compare to him in this world?

Could it be that the other was a top-grade Heaven Soul monarch tier?

That had to be the case.

“Come down, kneel and cripple your limbs, and I will spare your life,” he stated calmly. Even if he felt pressure, he was still filled with confidence in himself, and thought that if they were really going to battle, he would definitely still be the ultimate victor.

To defeat an opponent stronger than him was something he was an expert in. It was also a tag that was attached to him, a dazzling halo of light.

Ling Han chuckled, and then spat out, “Idiot!”

Idiot?

Yulan Fenghua was slightly startled, and then a shock filled with absolute disbelief rose up in him.

Was this really a monarch tier? To actually speak in such an unreserved manner, this was practically disgraceful.

Involuntarily, he clenched his fists. The self-control that he had always taken pride in seemed to easily collapse in front of Ling Han. He took a few deep breaths, and only then did he suppress his fury. “The pride of our Imperial Void Sect cannot be trampled on by anyone. Since you refuse to take the way out that I have already offered to you, I can only send you on your way to the underworld.”

“Where does your confidence come from?” Ling Han bit into a crisp apple, appearing incredibly casual. “What I enjoy the most is stepping on those so-called prodigies. You seem to have an itch, so are you asking to be beaten?”

“You’re seeking death!” Yulan Fenghua exclaimed lightly. His figure rose into the air, and charged towards Ling Han. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ling Han’s right hand clenched into a fist, and delivered a punch at Yulan Fenghua.

Peng, the two men each launched a blow. Instantly, Origin Power clashed first, forming a contention of power. Boundless Regulations surged, turning into indestructible blades.?Peng, peng, peng,?all objects in their surroundings were instantly rendered into scraps.

Because Ling Han had moved in, the surrounding residents had long since moved out, but there were still a great many people that had come with Yulan Fenghua. Swept by these sharp blades, many were immediately killed.

Liu Huashan couldn’t help but shiver, his face twitching madly.

They were done for, done for. Those that were qualified to come were the pillars of support of the clan, and now practically more than half of them had been eliminated with a single clash. To the Liu Clan, this was a severe hit, and they might not be able to recover from this kind of damage even in several hundred million years.

Why was this still the result when Yulan Fenghua had come?

This time, Yulan Fenghua was really surprised.

Ling Han was actually Yin Soul Tier, a minor level lower than himself even.

‘Impossible!’

His opponent’s cultivation level was lower than his own, yet the other party could actually exude such intimidating pressure, and made him feel as if he was facing a powerful foe. In fact, he even managed to sustain a blow from him.

How could there be such a freak?

“I am Yulan Fenghua,” he announced in a deep voice. He did not even spare a glance at the members of Liu Clan, who had been implicated in the shock wave, and were looking at him.

The Imperial Void Celestial King really had too many descendants, and facing such existences whose bloodline was so distant that it was practically negligible, and who had such lowly origins, there was naturally no need to be overly concerned about their life or death.

“Ling Han,” Ling Han calmly stated, a hint of seriousness flashing through his gaze.

The pressure that Yulan Fenghua gave him was not inferior to what he felt from Ji Wuming. However, Yulan Fenghua was an Earth Soul, a minor level higher than Ling Han. With such a comparison, it could be seen that Yulan Fenghua was inferior to Ji Wuming.

True, Ji Wuming was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King that had reincarnated and was recultivating. Aside from a person like Ling Han who was blessed by heaven, how could others compare?

“Ling Han? Ling Han?” Yulan Fenghua murmured a few times. “I will remember that.”

“No need, no need.” Ling Han hurriedly waved a hand. “I do not have the habit of being remembered by men.”

“Cheeky mouth!” Yulan Fenghua’s expression darkened. He raised his right hand, and gripped the empty air, as if there was something solid in his hand. Then, he began to drag from his left hand to his right hand, and a transparent sword appeared out of thin air.

“If you can block 100 moves from me, I’ll spare your life,” he declared.

Though Ling Han had managed to block a blow from Yulan Fenghua, the latter was still filled with an absolute confidence in victory and himself. However, he still did not dare to underestimate Ling Han in the slightest, and summoned his own Pseudo-Celestial Tool.

Otherwise, he did not have the confidence that he could kill Ling Han in 100 moves.

“Then, I’ll play with you.” Ling Han felt a thrill. He, too, wanted to know what extent his present battle prowess had reached.

“Kill!” Yulan Fenghua’s figure pounced, and in a flash, it was three divided souls charging out together. They charged to assault Ling Han from three sides, while the original was brandishing the Pseudo-Celestial Tool in a slash towards Ling Han.

There were just four of them, yet possessed an imposing aura as if not even a magnificent army could compare. Any one of them could easily pierce a hole in the dome of heaven, and dictate the heaven and earth.

Ling Han did not use his divided souls, but rather drew the Divine Demon Sword, and charged towards Yulan Fenghua.

“Arrogance!” Yulan Fenghua smirked coldly. The other man wanted to oppose him without using his divided souls?

The four of him were one and the same, and launched a mad offensive towards Ling Han simultaneously.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The careless shock waves produced from their clashes could cause massive damage. Before even 10 moves had lapsed, the small town of the Liu Clan had already been completely destroyed. Not only had the foundations completely vanished, even a deep layer of the land had been scraped away, turning into a large lake.

Ling Han and Yulan Fenghua were battling intensely above this lake.

Ling Han channeled various Source Powers, but not only was he unable to suppress Yulan Fenghua, he was beaten into continuous retreat, and had fallen into a disadvantage.

Strong, he was really strong.

He had no choice but to summon his two divided souls to join the battle, or he would really be no match for Yulan Fenghua.

The two great young prodigies were all exerting their full efforts. Every blow was capable of rendering the sun dim and lightless, causing even the stars to lose their color.

Yulan Fenghua’s expression was slightly ugly. He actually only managed to battle Ling Han to a tie!

To say nothing of the fact he still had a superior advantage of a minor level, even if both their cultivation levels were equal, this was still something he could not accept.

In a battle of equal cultivation levels, he should be absolutely invincible!

“It’s about close to 300 moves, right?” Ling Han asked casually. Previously, Yulan Fenghua had made a promise of defeating Ling Han within 100 moves.

Yulan Fenghua did not utter a word. He was now truly angered. Even if he could not kill Ling Han, he still wanted to defeat Ling Han.

Otherwise, his pride would not allow it.

“Heavenly Pillar!” he shouted lightly, and made a pulling movement.

Suddenly, a transparent, crystal-like pillar descended from the heavens, pressing down on Ling Han.

‘Huh?’

Ling Han shockingly discovered that his body could no longer move.
