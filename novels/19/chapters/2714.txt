2715 Top of the Leaderboard

This place was astonishingly large, and Ling Han’s group walked along the city wall for a long time before finally seeing where the Celestial Administration was located.

It was a very large building, but only had one floor. It was huge, but the design was extremely simple.

Right, this was a battlefield, not a place for pleasure, so what was the point of making it splendorous and majestic?

The four of them went in, and someone immediately received them, registered their identity information, and arranged accommodations for them.

Ling Han immediately asked about Heavenborn’s whereabouts.

“Heavenborn? Heavenborn?” The man murmured for a moment, and then he came to a sudden realization. “Is that the guy who was born with a physique of Divine Metal? Tsk, tsk, that guy is incredible. He has only been here for 10,000,000 years, and yet he has already become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He can even be compared with a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, truly amazing.”

Ling Han knew that a highly talented person like Heavenborn would cause a sensation wherever he went, so finding out Heavenborn’s whereabouts should be easy.

Sure enough, the man continued, “Heavenborn should have gone out of the city to hunt and kill the surviving members of Hysteria’s army after they besieged the city.”

“Thank you.” Ling Han nodded towards that person.

The four of them went back to their residence. Here, everyone would be provided with a residence. In addition, there were strict restrictions that absolutely forbade infighting. Should there be any personal grievances, the parties were required to leave here and take the fight outside.

Here, everyone was considered as one body, with just one goal, and that was to fight Hysteria.

Of course, infighting was forbidden, but it did not prohibit sparring between cultivators, which helped to improve one’s cultivation level, and naturally would not be prohibited.

Not long after Ling Han’s group settled down, the large black dog couldn’t help urging, “Hurry up and find Heavenborn!”

Ling Han shook his head. “How can we find him?”

Once out of the city, with the world being so vast, there was no telling where Heavenborn could have gone. Even if Wally was brought here, he would be completely at the end of his wits.

“When Heavenborn comes back, we will keep an eye on him. Whether it’s striking a staggering blow in the middle of the night or waiting for him to leave the city, there’s always a chance to strike,” Ling Han said.

Only then did the large black dog restrain himself; he was indeed too impatient.

Aside from Heavenborn, Ling Han also wanted to find He Yufeng, who had taken advantage of his position to bully him previously. Now that he also possessed the battle prowess of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he wanted to see who would be more powerful between the two of them.

In the end, He Yufeng had also gone out of the city.

This was a regular pattern. Now the time was to hunt them down, and after a while, when Hysteria’s army launched an attack, everyone would retreat to stay behind the wall, otherwise they themselves would become lone soldiers and be destroyed instantly under the attack of the army.

And the same cycle would repeat itself. It had always been like this.

In order not to let life be too boring, introducing a mechanism for competition was obviously a good idea.

Hence, there was a leaderboard of battle merits based on the number and quality of kills made against the enemy.

…Amongst Hysteria’s army here, there were also those at the Ninth Heaven and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. That being the case, if one was to kill any of them, one’s battle merit would naturally be different.

This also made it impossible for Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to be on the leaderboard. The leaderboard was the stage for the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates’ competition of strength.

Since Ling Han was also idle, he went to take a look.

The leaderboard was located outside the Celestial Administration, set up upon two huge stone tablets, which would only be updated every 1,000 years.

The last update was 999 years ago, that was to say, the leaderboard would be updated at any time, perhaps even tomorrow.

Why were there two ranking lists?

One was the general list, which would add up the total battle merits throughout history, while the other was the current list. For example, if some Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate advanced to become a Heavenly Venerate, they would appear on the second spatial level, and their names would be removed from the current list.

Ling Han looked at the general list first. These were the strongest Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates since ancient times—a total of 1,000 people had been selected. Seeing that there were quite a lot of people, it was probably to give more people a sense of participation.

Xin Qihu!

Ling Han quickly found Xin Qihu’s name in the 964th place, along with a brief summary of his battle merits.

“In 13,540,000 years, having killed 3,567 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and 48,553 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

What surprised Ling Han was that Xin Qihu took such a short time to advance to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate Tier—only about 10,000,000 years.

He had made his way onto the list in just over 10,000,000 years. Looking at the two people above and below him, respectively, they had fought bloody battles for billions of years!

It should be known that being on the list meant that the person had an amazing aptitude, and would definitely become a Heavenly Venerate. Wasn’t this kind of comparison amazing?

No wonder he was so highly respected by Lin Piaoxue.

Ling Han scanned again, and saw Lin Youlian’s name.

She was ranked 982nd, and her summary was “12,240,000 years, having killed 2,966 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates and 50,084 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.”

Similarly amazing!

However, the general list was actually not very significant, as there were some people who stayed as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate for a long time, while there were others who remained in that state for a short time—this couldn’t be a fair comparison.

So one would have to look at the current list. It even had a time limit, which was that it would only count the battle merits of the last 1,000,000 years, and not the accumulated figures.

1,000,000 years was indeed too short. Even supreme prodigies like Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian needed more than 10,000,000 years to reach this level, so it could be said that this was a very fair comparison.

Ling Han wasn’t interested in this kind of leaderboard; he only had one goal, which was to become a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“However, there’s no harm trying it out.”

How were the battle merits counted?

Previously, once they had reported for duty, each of them was given a ring. This was a special Celestial Tool which had a certain life-saving effect. In addition, it would also count the number of enemies killed, with the ability to distinguish between Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

It was said that some people were very low-key. They didn’t want the others to know their battle prowess, and thus would take off their rings during battle so that their battle merits wouldn’t be counted.

On the current list, Ling Han saw a familiar name.

He Yufeng, but he was only ranked in the 800th place. As for Heavenborn, his ranking was unknown.

It was only normal. Heavenborn was at the Ninth Heaven. Even if he could fight against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, was he able to kill one? But if he was just killing Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, how many would he be required to kill to be on the leaderboard?

“The leaderboard may be updated at any time, so He Yufeng and Heavenborn might come back soon to see the changes in their rankings,” Ling Han murmured. Thus, he decided to stay in the city for the next few days until the leaderboard was updated. However, it was possible that Hysteria would have already launched a new wave of assault if he were to go out of the city to fight again by that time.

Young people, no matter how calmly they said it, were actually very concerned about things like rankings as they all had an air of arrogance, and would not want to be inferior to others.

Therefore, with this being the year when the leaderboard would be updated, many people who had been cultivating outside returned one after another to see if they were to have a chance to make it to the current list.

…No need to think about the general list. Unless they had been fighting for countless years, and were about to become the First Tier Heavenly Venerate, it would only be wishful thinking to hope for making this list.

Every day, a large number of young elites would return. Some people clearly knew that they could not make it onto the leaderboard, but they were extremely curious. They just wanted to know who would be on the leaderboard.

10 days, one month, and more and more people would gather in this city that was unlike a city. Every day, they would make a trip to the Celestial Administration to see whether the leaderboard had been updated.

Another half a month later, the leaderboard was finally updated.

“Damn, who is this Ling Han? How did he get to the top ranking of the current list without making a sound!”

“How is this possible? The current list counts one’s battle merits in the last 1,000,000 years. He wasn’t on the list the last time, which means that he surpassed at least 1,000 names in these 1,000 years! He went from not being on the list to reaching the top ranking of the list?”

There was an uproar in the crowd.
