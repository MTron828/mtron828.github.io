Chapter 2020: Rival in love

Ling Han had a great many enemies, but to have someone he had never even seen before suddenly deliver a fatal attack against him made him feel extremely curious.

He casually sent out a kick, and with a ding, that sneak attacker’s sword flew out of his grip.

That was a pretty boy, his skin so fine that it could induce envy in a great many women. His appearance was also considerably handsome. However, he was a little weak, and could only be at fourth severance, at most.

Ling Han’s expression was calm as he asked, “Why did you want to kill me?”

“You are my rival in love, so isn’t it reasonable that I want to kill you?” that pretty boy countered, his head raised high.

“Rival in love?” Ling Han was surprised. When did he have such a rival in love like this?

Hold on, Lan Ruozhi?

He couldn’t help but shake his head, and said, “I think you have misunderstood.”

“Really?” That pretty boy made no further move, and took two steps forwards. “You really won’t try to contest with me over Ruozhi?”

When he uttered the last word, he suddenly moved again, his right hand forming claws as he mercilessly delivered a claw strike at Ling Han’s chest.

This brat was really sly.

Ling Han sent out another kick, landing solidly between the legs of that pretty boy.

“Ow!” The pretty boy immediately released a pained yowl, his body involuntarily crumbling. His hands covered his crotch as layers of cold sweat flowed down his forehead.

“I really could not tell that a person that looks so fair would be so black-hearted!” Ling Han said.

The pretty boy was already incapable of speech. This kick was not just strong in force, but also contained a sliver of Regulations of heaven and earth. To Ling Han, this was just a sliver, but to a fourth severance, this tiny sliver was already earth-shattering.

Veins popped on the pretty boy’s forehead, and after a while, he finally said, “It’s you who are too stupid!”

“I’m stupid?” Ling Han shook his head, and then sent out a punch. Pa, the pretty boy was instantly turned into a shower of blood from the blow.

Since he had made a move on him, then he should have prepared himself to be killed in return.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu. Another seven people pounced out, charging towards Ling Han.

“Die!” Though the seven of them did not look the same, they all had one shared trait, and that was that they all looked especially handsome. Furthermore, they were all fair and smooth in complexion, every single one of them pretty boys.

‘F***, these shouldn’t all be Lan Ruozhi’s lovers, right?’

Ling Han felt disgust rise up in his heart. Just what kind of ****** conflict had he gotten himself involved in?

Moreover, these lovers were a little too merciless, weren’t they? They hadn’t even truly met yet, and they were already wanting to kill him.

Ling Han shook his head, sending out a punch. Fiery flames blazed, and instantly turned the seven of them into dust.

This also intimidated the others, and they did not dare pounce over again.

They were indeed Lan Ruozhi’s lovers, and in Lan Ruozhi’s “harem”, her lovers were allowed to attack each other fatally. This was a kind of pleasure in Lan Ruozhi’s eyes as she delighted in how her lovers would fly into a rage out of jealousy in front of her while they attacked each other violently in secret.

If that hadn’t been the case, the number of her lovers would have long since exceeded 100 instead of merely these dozen and some at present.

Afterwards, this had become a custom. Every time there would be a new entry, all her lovers would work together to deal with him. If they could kill him, they would so they would have one less competitor for her affections.

However, this time, they had clearly met their match. Ling Han was indescribably strong.

This was really disgusting!

Ling Han mocked endlessly. He had not thought that he had just said a few words to Lan Ruozhi, and he was already embroiled in this kind of farce. If this spread out, he would definitely be laughed at and ridiculed. To think that he would actually be striving for favor with a bunch of pretty boys.

‘F***.’

Ling Han’s figure charged out, his battle prowess on full throttle. The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul had also been brought into play. Fiery flames blazed, Sword Qi soared, and the rate of slaughter was astonishingly high.

The marine creatures’ attacks came in wave after wave, as if there was no end to it.

To say nothing of the others, even Ling Han himself could feel a weariness rise up in him.

“Next shift!”

An austere voice rang out, and a new batch of people came out from the ancient castle, switching shifts with the people who were already completely fully expended from the battle, and continuing to battle fiercely with the marine creatures.

Once everyone retreated, they collapsed onto the ground, feeling an incredible soreness in every single bone of their bodies.

Ling Han also took advantage of the time to recover his Origin Power. He had cultivated every cultivation level to complete perfection, so he had a continuous supply of power, was far more capable of exertion than the others in the same cultivation level, and his recovery rate was also much faster.

Three days later, they had another change of shift.

Qin Wei and the others were incredibly gloomy. They had not enjoyed any benefits yet, but already had to work hard. But if they didn’t, it wouldn’t do, either. Once these marine creatures broke through the lines of defense, all of them would be dead.

This was like a war that had no end. Every marine creature was fearless of death, and tried its best to barrage against the lines of defense of the island, and the island residents were also putting their all into resistance, causing Ascent Route Island to become a slaughterhouse.

What reassured Qin Wei and the rest was that, at least up to the present, there were only injuries, and no deaths.

This was very inconceivable. Under such a powerful offensive, there were actually no deaths on their side.

At first, Ling Han had not noticed, but he soon discovered this fact. Thus, he placed his attention on the others as well, and realized that it was not they that were lucky, but that when someone encountered a deadly danger, those marine creatures would die for some inconceivable reason.

In such chaotic battles, this was not very obvious, but as long as one paid attention, he would definitely realize this.

Ling Han couldn’t help but turn and look in the direction of the ancient castle. So far, that mysterious Island Master still had not appeared. Perhaps it was he that was interfering from the shadows, and thus ensured that no one died.

An Ascending Origin Tier elite absolutely had that kind of ability.

Why did he have to save them then?

Very simple. Every single person here was a student of the alternate cultivation system, and would spread it out, so how could they be easily sacrificed?

The alternate system of cultivation would cause damage to the Regulations of the heaven and earth, and would be strictly forbidden by all forces. When it was taught, it had to be done secretly, and thus was in more dire need of manpower.

On one side, that Island Master needed people to help him prepare the sacrifice, slaughtering marine creatures, and on another, he also had to protect the people here so that they could spread out that new cultivation system, and that was what led to the present situation.

Linking all the cause and effect of the situation together, Ling Han thought that his deduction could explain everything very well, so he was sure that his deduction was correct.

“Why is the beast tide so fierce this time?” a native complained.

“That’s right. In the past, it would last two to three days at most, but this time, it’s already been close to 10 days.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“If this goes on, everyone won’t be able to hold on much longer.”

“Why hasn’t Lord Island Master appeared yet? With him changing the flow of the tides, we should be able to win easily.”

Yet Ling Han understood why in his mind. That Island Master had to be managing the ceremony for the sacrifice. Perhaps, he did not trust any other person, so he did not even participate in the battles, and would only occasionally emerge to save someone.

‘Since the time period of the beast tide this time has exceeded previous times, and Small Tower has also said that removing the murderous aura of the Firm Essence Green Gold would also need another two to three rounds of sacrifices, then it is very possible that that Island Master wants to succeed with this one time, and that was why he has extended the time period for the beast tide.

‘Hehe, looks like I, too, should make my move.’
