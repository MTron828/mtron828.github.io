Chapter 1607: Killed with a single strike

Hu Yangchen crooked a finger at Ling Han. He had a mission, and that was to force Ling Han into a corner. No matter who was standing behind Ling Han, they would definitely appear then.

There was no need to worry about the Star Sand Saint and the other Saints, as Grand elder would naturally be suppressing them.

Ling Han leaped out, a faint smile on his face.

“Ling Han, I will give you a sincere warning, hand over the treasure trove of the Heavenly River King, and I can leave you with a full corpse,” Hu Yangchen stated calmly. In his eyes, his victory in this battle was naturally assured, and it was not worth his notice at all.

He was one that had formed close to 3,000,000 stars!

Ling Han took one look at Hu Yangchen, and said, “Since that is the case, I will also give you a choice. Would you like to be dismembered, or have your bones shattered and your ashes scattered into the wind?”

Tit for tat, neither showing any weakness.

All the disciples strongly balled their hands into fists, feeling their anger vented. Previously, they had been suppressed too harshly. It was only an impulsive action on Hu Luo’s part, and it was almost enough for Cai Miao to surpass a god, defeating a good many big shots in quick succession. Thankfully, the Empress was strong enough, and had suppressed Cai Miao.

But Cai Miao was still a disciple of the academy, after all, so even if he was suppressed, so what? It could only be claimed that a traitor had been dealt with, and it could only be considered a completely superficial blow to the Hu Clan, but if Hu Yangchen could be killed, that would be a severe blow to the Hu Clan.

Of course, the majority of them were only dreaming. With a Saint King in the sidelines, did Ling Han dare deliver a fatal blow? Even if he did, would he be able to succeed?

Previously, the members of the Hu Clan had watched indifferently from the sidelines because they did not take Cai Miao to heart, but how could that possibly be the same for Hu Yangchen?

“What a sharp tongue!” Hu Yangchen smirked coldly. With a thought, his silvery river appeared. Weng, innumerable stars shone with blazing light in the silvery river.

Pu!

All the disciples spluttered, all of them gaping, completely unable to believe their eyes.

Close to 3,000,000 stars!

Was this not power on the level of Saints?

No wonder he dared be so arrogant, no wonder the Hu Clan was so powerful. Just because of this, everyone would have to admit that they were impressed.

Too strong.

Ling Han... could not possibly be a match for that.

“Senior Brother Ling, he is in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, and you are only in the high extreme. This battle is unjust.”

“That’s right. This is unfair, you don’t have to fight.”

A great many people said thus to Ling Han. If he forced himself in this battle, it would only result in his meaningless death.

“Still planning to flee now?” Hu Yangchen smirked coldly. He delivered a palm strike, and the power of his silvery river surged, taking the form of a massive blue bird of prey that grabbed out at Ling Han.

A cold flash flickered in Ling Han’s eyes. His full power burst beneath his feet, and he suddenly charged out at Hu Yangchen.

The blue bird of prey arrived, yet Ling Han made no move to dodge or hide.

Was he seeking his own death?

Hu Yangchen smirked coldly, and all the disciples were watching anxiously.

“Banishment!” Ling Han said softly. In the instant the blue bird of prey arrived in front of him, it suddenly disappeared. Xiu, he was completely unhindered, and had already arrived in front of Hu Yangchen.

How could this be possible!?

Hu Yangchen’s eyes widened. No matter what, he could not believe this. His attack had actually disappeared into thin air! If it had been dispelled, or dodged, he could accept that, and had even long since prepared his next move, but he had never imagined that Ling Han would actually be able to charge right up to him in a head-on confrontation.

This was completely outside of his expectations, and he was completely caught off guard.

Boom, Ling Han’s fist reached its target.

“Humph!” Yet Hu Yangchen did not panic. Though he was a little passive, his power overwhelmed Ling Han by who knew how many times, and even if he could only presently use a ten-thousandth of his power, he would still be able to overwhelm Ling Han.

Merely in terms of power, he could even be comparable to a Saint. Was that not awesome enough?

Ling Han’s punch landed, and only at this moment did the 27 killing formations activate, and explode with an endless battle prowess.

What he wanted was an absolutely fatal attack, not allowing any opportunity for the members of the Hu Clan to save him!

All the Saints could tell that there were killing formations inscribed in his body, and their number was not small, either, but aside from a Saint that focused on formations like the Tranquil Heart Saint, none of them were able to tell how frightening so many killing formations added together would be.

In truth, even the Tranquil Heart Saint could only make a guess because no one had been able to reach this extent previously. Since that was the case, how could he make an accurate estimate?

If he had stimulated the killing formations the moment he moved, the Saints would definitely be able to tell how terrifying it was, but their might only exploded in a burst when the punch arrived at its target, and even if the Saints of the Hu Clan wanted to stop it, they were too late.

Peng!

His fist landed, and without the slightest doubt, Hu Yangchen directly exploded into a shower of blood from the impact. Some of his blood even spurted onto Ling Han. He did not dodge or hide, bathing in the blood. Today, he was going to launch a massacre, and kill Saints again.

Xiu, at this moment, the blue bird of prey that Hu Yangchen had shot out suddenly appeared, charging out at the place where there was no longer anyone standing. It was now completely meaningless.

A dead silence fell.

Who could have imagined that a big shot that had formed close to 3,000,000 stars would actually be killed with a single punch from someone in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier!

At first, Hu Luo was stunned, which was followed by thunderous rage. Turbid air spurted from his nostrils, creating ripples in the space itself. The Star Sand Saint beside him almost collapsed onto the ground.

This had nothing to do with willpower and courage. It was completely suppression from a superior cultivation level.

His initial plans were to force Ling Han into desperate straits, then no matter who was behind Ling Han, they would definitely appear, and in that way, he would be able to decide whether it was better to battle or make peace based on the circumstances.

However, he had not thought that he had not managed to force out Ling Han’s backer, and instead caused an outstanding descendant of his to die.

His emotions were stirred. Boom, his whole head of white hair fluttered, and there were flames interwoven among his hair. That was his rage taking solid form, which showed clearly what kind of terrible mood he was presently in.

“Dongping, apprehend this brat!” he said in a gruff voice, issuing a command to one of the Saints.

“Yes, Grand Elder!” That Saint obeyed the command. That was the fifth Saint of the Hu Clan, and he was also a Medium Saint. His name was Hu Dongping.

“Senior!” The Star Sand Saint stood up, wanting to stop him, yet with a glare from Hu Luo, he immediately sat back down.

In front of a Saint King, even if he was a Great Saint, that was completely not enough.

The Tranquil Heart Saint and the others all frowned deeply. If a Medium Saint made his move, even they were no match for him, what more Ling Han?

“Boy, who is standing behind you that dares make an enemy of our Hu Clan?” Hu Dongping asked coldly.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “Afraid? If you’re afraid, just admit it frankly. Come, kneel down and call me grandfather, and I can consider sparing your wretched life.”

“Wretched life your sister, watch out for my Savage Heaven Kick!” Xiu, a shadow streaked past, and as expected, a paw was kicking out towards Ling Han.

It was the large black dog!

Ling Han waved a hand casually, and the large black dog suddenly disappeared. He calmly took a step back, and shua, the large black dog reappeared, and naturally missed the target of his attack. Peng, he fell onto the ground, causing a stir in the dust on the ground.

“Yi, damn brat, what kind of strange and bizarre technique have you learnt this time?” The large black dog scratched his neck with one of his hind legs.

“Just don’t seek your own suffering,” Ling Han said smilingly.

On the other side, Hu Dongping was almost half dead with fury. Just how much did this boy and dog look down on him that they were actually chatting idly right in front of him?

“Die!” He stretched open his right hand, and pressed it down on both Ling Han and the large black dog at the same time.
