Chapter 2520: Eighth!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han sat down, completely focused as he pondered the symbols of the great dao.

He was in no hurry to pass this formation. After all, this was a rare opportunity for him to comprehend these symbols of the great dao. However, if he wanted to challenge this formation… he could do so at any time.

After at least three days, Ling Han finally stood up in satisfaction. He had reaped huge benefits this time.

These symbols of the great dao had most likely been gathered and formed by the magnificent power of Heavenly Venerates. To a Third Heaven Celestial King such as him, they were indescribably useful and beneficial.

It was no wonder that some prodigies hadn’t made it onto the Eternal Stone. It was because they had been distracted here, spending a great deal of time comprehending these symbols of the great dao. The gap between these prodigies was already small to begin with, so could they afford to waste three days here?

Even though there was no explicit rule or explanation, Ling Han had a feeling that each person would only have a single chance to comprehend these symbols.

Such rare opportunities could only come through fortune, not through searching.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. Should he challenge this formation again?

Making a conscious effort to achieve a higher ranking was not something that he liked. However, in order to suppress Heavenborn, he was willing to challenge this level again.

He strode forward, easily breezing through the War Soldiers that stood before him. War Soldiers at the Second Heaven naturally couldn’t slow him down. He arrived before the large river again.

Just like before, stone platforms bobbed up and down, with their speed incredibly astonishing.

There was even less of a pattern this time, and this gave Ling Han a huge headache.

After an entire day, he finally made sense of the patterns behind the movements. He immediately leaped forward.

......

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

In just a few dozen jumps, he arrived on the other side of the river.

After arriving here, he had essentially passed the Nine Deaths Formation already.

Sure enough, after walking for a short while, a stone tablet appeared before him again. Surprisingly, this was exactly where he had entered the formation from.

“Congratulations on passing the second level,” Ouyang Ming said. He was still standing in the same spot, and a smile spread across his face when he saw Ling Han arrive.

Even though Ling Han’s result was unable to win him a spot on the Eternal Stone, just his ability to pass the second level alone was already outstanding. At the very least, it deserved his respect.

“Follow me, I’ll bring you to your residence,” he said.

However, Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “I want to challenge this level again.”

Ouyang Ming frowned upon hearing this. What was the hurry? Moreover, Ling Han had only just passed the level, so how much could his result improve if he immediately challenged it again? In any case, he had spent four entire days to pass the level, a time far inferior to what was needed to enter the rankings.

The others all waited for several years before challenging the formation again, raising their power to a peak state. With Ling Han’s request, not only would his result not improve, but it might even decline.

However, since Ling Han insisted, there would be no point for Ouyang Ming to object.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you,” he said.

Ling Han smiled before entering the second level again.

There was nothing much to say about the early challenges. He simply steamrolled them with his crushing power. After arriving before the city gates, he unleashed all of his power.

If he wanted to defeat Heavenborn, he wouldn’t be able to do so in the stages that involved battle. His only chance to defeat Heavenborn was in terms of comprehension and analytical ability. Meanwhile, Ling Han was extremely confident in these areas.

After a short while, Ling Han successfully rearranged the 40 words. This time, they were genuine words and not symbols of the great dao.

He was drawn into the city, where he immediately unleashed his ferocious power.

Peng, peng, peng!

His fists were invincible, and he bulldozed through the War Soldiers before arriving at the large river.

Even though this was still the second level, the patterns of the bobbling rock platforms changed again. Ling Han took another day to comprehend the mysterious patterns of their movement. He immediately bounded forward.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

In a few bounds, he arrived on the opposite bank. He then strode forward.

When he exited the formation, he coincidentally saw Heavenborn also walking out from behind the fourth stone tablet. His brows were furrowed, and it was clear that he was extremely displeased.

It was evident that he hadn’t achieved any breakthroughs in his result. Thus, he was naturally extremely displeased.

“F-friend!” Ouyang Ming stammered as he walked over. His voice was quivering.

“Hmm?” Ling Han looked over. What was he so astonished about?

“Congratulations, friend! You’ve made it into the rankings!” Ouyang Ming finally said. He could finally form a proper sentence again.

He was truly unable to fathom how Ling Han’s results had improved by so much. Last time, it had taken Ling Han four entire days to pass the level. This time, however, he had directly made it into the rankings.

Ling Han nodded in acknowledgment. He knew that he would definitely make it into the rankings. However, the most important thing was where he ranked.

“Where did I rank?” he asked.

“Eighth!” Ouyang Ming replied. This result was far too terrifying. In terms of the prodigies who were still at the martial academy, only A’mu had achieved a better result than this. Du Shiyi, Heavenborn, Huo Furong, and the others had all been pushed down the ranking.

‘Eighth?’

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Even though he hadn’t performed to the best of his potential, he was still slightly disappointed that he had only ranked eighth.

In his mind, it should have been fairly easy to challenge the top five positions. Now, however, the gap between them was still fairly large.

However, upon further thought, he immediately felt at ease.

At the end of the day, the Celestial Realm was only a super low-level dimension. Moreover, his Evolution Index was only 11, perhaps slightly higher. However, it definitely hadn’t reached 12. That being the case, was it strange that his result was inferior to those freaks’ results? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Instead, this caused his fighting spirit to soar. He decided to compete with those freaks in the third level after he fully recovered his cultivation. After all, this result was because of his crushing advantage in cultivation level. It didn’t reflect his true abilities.

This was evident by looking at the fifth level. A’mu, Heavenborn, and the others were all ranked around 20th.

“Hmm?” Heavenborn had already turned around to leave, yet upon hearing Ouyang Ming’s reply, he violently turned around.

Eighth?

Then wouldn’t he be pushed down?

He swept his gaze over. Sure enough, his name had fallen from ninth to 10th.

Displeasure instantly spread across Heavenborn’s face. This was because he detested the feeling of being inferior to others. It was also because of this that he challenged this formation time and time again. He yearned to surpass everyone above him. Now, however, he had actually been suppressed by a new disciple? This ticked him off immensely.

However, he immediately humphed before turning around to leave.

This was only the second level, after all. Thus, many people suppressed their cultivation level to challenge this formation. Even though their battle prowess would be suppressed, their divine sense wouldn’t be affected at all. Thus, they would possess a huge advantage when it came to rearranging the words and crossing the river.

Ling Han’s cultivation level was unclear, so it was evident that he had concealed it on purpose. Perhaps he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

Thus, Heavenborn felt he needed not pay any heed to this.

The only people who could grab his attention were the martial academy’s A’mu, Du Shiyi, and so on. These were all prodigies who possessed Evolution Indices of 12 or above!

As for these lowly cultivators who didn’t even dare to show their cultivation or face? It was beneath him to pay any attention to them.

Meanwhile, Ling Han gazed at Heavenborn’s leaving figure. In the near future, he would defeat this person in a fair-and-square battle, not just through this kind of meaningless method.

“Friend Zhang, you’re truly outstanding!” Ouyang Ming said in praise. Regardless of whether he was a high-level Celestial King or not, his ability to enter the rankings alone was already a reflection of his boundless talent.

Toward this kind of person, he didn’t need to simply become associated with them. Instead, he needed to curry favor with and toad up to them!

Ouyang Ming brought Ling Han into the academy. This was an endless mountain range that looked like an entire world. Even with Ling Han’s powerful vision, he still couldn’t see the end.

Under Ouyang Ming’s arrangement, he received an abode that was rich with Spiritual Qi. This was a holy land for cultivation.

After sending off Ouyang Ming, Ling Han took out the cauldron that he had purchased not long ago. He planned to test its ability to refine alchemical pills.
