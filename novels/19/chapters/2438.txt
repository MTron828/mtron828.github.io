Chapter 2439: Water Vine

Ling Han threw another punch.

Peng!

His strike landed on the chest of the corpse, its wild power causing the ribs of the corpse to instantly shatter, blowing a hole through its back.

This corpse had already been drained of its blood. Thus, even though its body was torn apart, all that flowed out was seawater and some kind of unknown gray matter.

Peng!

The corpse was blasted into the sea again. This time, however, it didn’t resurface.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Its Vitality Index is around 4700.”

This was far inferior to the four of them. In fact, even Bewitching Maiden Rou had a Vitality Index of 4700. Thus, they hadn’t needed to fear that corpse at all.

However, this situation was only specific to them. One had to realize that ordinary cultivators at the peak stage of the Ascending Origin Tier only had a Vitality Index of around 4300. Even monarch stars would only have a Vitality Index of around 4500. From this, it was clear just how powerful a Vitality Index of 4700 was.

If one weren’t a Pseudo-Celestial King, they would need to ingest some Crimson Demonic Earth if they wanted to rival these corpses. Of course, Ling Han was a completely different matter. After all, only one such freak existed in the countless dimensions and after countless epochs.

Ling Han wore a solemn expression. Even though the corpse hadn’t been threatening, how had it been formed? That person hadn’t appeared to be too powerful while alive, with his Vitality Index back then hovering around 4300 at most. Perhaps 4400. There had been a limit to his power.

There was a terrifying secret hidden in this sea.

Splash!

There was a splash of water as the corpse suddenly resurfaced before them. This time, it had finally undergone some transformations. There was a gray vine wrapped around its spine, and it was as if it were injecting something into the corpse.

This was most likely the vine of some water grass. It was tubular in form, and there was some kind of indescribable fluid coursing through its length. It was incredibly long, and it had most probably slithered out from the depths of the sea.

Weng!

The corpse opened its eyes again. This time, there was a film of hazy gray on its deathly white eyes.

“So this is how the Undead Sea got its name,” Ling Han said. Even though the living beings who fell into the sea would be killed, they would be “revived” through some strange method. Moreover, they couldn’t be killed no matter what. In a sense, they were undead.

“Let Niu deal with it!” Hu Niu said with excitement. She loved this kind of fresh challenge.

Peng!

She dashed forward, with her feet treading atop the seawater. Even though the Regulations here were strange, she could still stay above the water for a very long time.

The young lady charged her fist before swinging it at the corpse.

The water vine twisted like a whip, swinging the corpse at Hu Niu.

“Niu isn’t afraid!” Hu Niu shouted. The power of Regulations gathered on her fist as it blasted toward the corpse.

Peng, peng, peng!

The corpse continued to exchange blows with Hu Niu. However, it didn’t use its fists or legs. Instead, it used its entire body as a weapon. In reality, the water vine was the “hand” that was brandishing a weapon. Meanwhile, the weapon was the entire corpse.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It’s the plants in the sea that are ‘reviving’ the corpses. Moreover, this person was most likely killed by something from the sea as well… But this isn’t certain. Perhaps the plants in the sea took control of the corpse that he had been riding on, using it to toss him into the sea before killing him.

“Huh? Then there should be another corpse!'”

Just as he said this…

Splash!

Another corpse dashed out from the water, with its spine also entangled with a vine. It radiated with a malevolent aura as it charged at Hu Niu.

“These corpses are quite smart. They understand the notion of killing one enemy instead of only wounding five,” Ling Han remarked.

Bewitching Maiden Rou covered her mouth and chuckled. “Do you really think everyone is as dumb as you?”

Ling Han laughed as he charged forward with his sword. However, his target wasn’t the two corpses. Instead, it was the water vines.

Plop!

He directly dived into the sea. Seawater enveloped him, instantly surrounding him with an overwhelming aura of death that wanted to infiltrate his body and corrode his very being.

However, Ling Han was unafraid as he channeled his power, forcefully clearing his surroundings. This was a taxing task, and it was as if the entire sea had become his enemy, yearning to crush him into smithereens.

Being on the sea and being in the sea were two completely different notions.

After some calculations, Ling Han told himself that he could only maintain this state for two hours at most. Otherwise, even he would become exhausted.

Swoosh!

A water vine suddenly shot over from some unknown location in the depths of the sea, aiming to entangle Ling Han.

Ling Han met this attack with his sword, with gleams of ice-cold light accompanying a murderous aura that soared into the sky.

The water vine arrived, yet it was viciously struck by his sword. However, Ling Han felt as if he had struck a piece of Divine Metal. The vine was frighteningly tough.

However, it wasn’t genuine Divine Metal, after all. Ling Han unleashed his full power, upon which the Divine Demon Sword also unleashed a devastating murderous aura. With a crack, the water vine was forcefully cut into two. Gray matter instantly surged into the sea from this wound, and it was as if the water vine were bleeding. The surroundings were instantly dyed gray.

Ling Han immediately felt an increase in the concentration of the aura of death. It was as if tens of millions of thin needles were stabbing at his back, yearning to shatter his defenses.

‘Does the aura of death in this sea come from these water vines? Or have these water vines been transformed by the aura of death in the sea?’

Ling Han didn’t have time to ponder this as the severed vine lashed at him again. The water vine was unbelievably long, so the loss of six or so meters of it that Ling Han had severed barely affected it at all.

However, Ling Han replied with a cold chuckle. So what if this water vine was long? He would continue to cut it until there was nothing left to be cut!

The water vine attacked him several times, yet it was ruthlessly slashed off by him each time. In the end, it stopped this act of self-harm, rapidly shrinking back into the depths of the sea.

‘It’s given up just like that?’

However, Ling Han’s pupils instantly contracted. He looked down, only to see 17 dark objects shooting over from below. Looking carefully, these were 17 separate water vines!

‘It even knows to call friends?’

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless. If he were on the surface of the ground, he wouldn’t be afraid even if he were attacked by 170 water vines, much less 17. However, he was in the sea, where he needed to expend a great deal of energy resisting the pressure of the water. Thus, his battle prowess had naturally fallen by a significant amount.

With a kick of his feet, he swam toward the surface of the sea. Battling down here would be far too disadvantageous for him.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

The 17 water vines shot toward his feet. They were surprisingly intelligent, and they understood that they could achieve easy victory if they dragged Ling Han to the bottom of the sea.

Ling Han swung his sword, sending a burst of razor-sharp Sword Qi toward the water vines. Meanwhile, he took advantage of the backward momentum to rapidly rise to the surface of the sea.

Shua!

The Sword Qi swept over. However, the 17 water vines performed an astonishing action.

They surprisingly entangled together, forming a giant fist to punch at the Sword Qi.

Peng!

The sword light arrived, yet it only managed to leave a shallow mark on the water vines. The water vines then rapidly disentangled before continuing to shoot toward Ling Han.

With a crash, Ling Han broke through the surface of the sea. He stood atop it, and the pressure around him instantly vanished. Right now, he only needed to resist the peculiar power of Regulations in this region, preventing himself from sinking.

Splash, splash, splash…

The 17 water vines shot out from the water at almost the exact same time. They then attacked Ling Han from different directions.

Ling Han was unafraid as he battled these water vines with his Divine Demon Sword.

These water vines were far more powerful than the corpses, yet their Vitality Index was only around 4800. Even though he was facing them alone, Ling Han was still clearly relaxed and unfazed. He continued to swing his sword, with more and more severed vines landing in the sea, dying the water gray and filling it with an aura of death.

Whoosh!

The water vines suddenly retreated in unison, including the two corpse-wielding vines that had been battling against Hu Niu. They shrunk back into the sea together.
