Chapter 2240: Origin Magic Cube

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In this space, Ling Han had absolute confidence that he could tire anyone to death.

Unless… the opponent also possessed a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious treasure, and could extract power of Regulation without end for a few days.

The 12 of them all had extremely fast movement techniques.?Shua, shua, shua, one with poorer vision would not be able to catch sight of their true selves at all, and would only feel that people filled the whole space around them—that was because Ling Han and the others were moving too rapidly, leaving behind countless afterimages.

“Come on then!” Ling Han laughed loudly, his figure unpredictable in its movements.

Meng Feicheng and the rest had already been angered by Ling Han, and were determined to capture him. They all charged forwards earnestly, striking violently all the while, and wanting to restrict his movement technique.

They did not worry at all that their power of Regulation would be completely exhausted, because they were equivalent to three Fifth Secret monarch tiers. Any one of them had who knew how many times more power of Regulation than that locked in Ling Han’s body, what more when there were three of them.

If one was really going to be exhausted, it would have to be Ling Han that would first use all his power of Regulation.

Ling Han was very evil. As he ran, he continued to take out beast meat for consumption, looking like he was about to completely exhaust his power of Regulation, and had to consume beast meat to replenish what he had expended.

Meng Feicheng and the others naturally believed it completely. He was merely a First Secret, so it was naturally impossible that he could last very long.

“Let’s put in some more effort.” Liu Sanbian showed a twisted expression. “Though beast meat can replenish the power of Regulation, that would only be like a cup of water thrown on a burning cart of firewood. He will not be able to last long.”

Ling Han laughed internally. What he was devouring was not at all the meat of the living creatures here, but rather the beast meat of the Celestial Realm. However, it had already been roasted into dried meat, so who would be able to tell the difference?

He ran nonstop, and also ate continuously, expending who knew how much beast meat.

Meng Feicheng and the others all wanted to stop Ling Han, press him down, and then ask him, “Just how many living creatures of this place have you f****** hunted? How can you continue to eat without end?” If one continuously ate like him, even a mountain of meat would be completely devoured.

After chasing for a while longer, all their expressions shifted slightly.

That was because they discovered that their power of Regulation was running out too quickly, and their speed was actually declining.

They were even more shocked. Just how much beast meat had Ling Han consumed that he could actually tire them out to this extent?

It could not be helped. They, too, could only take out some beast meat for replenishment. If they really were to exhaust all their power of Regulation, Fifth Secret monarch tiers and emperor tiers like them would all be trash. They would be even weaker than Severing Mundane Tiers.

Ling Han saw this happen, and couldn’t help but smirk coldly. It was almost time for him to turn his defensive stance around to an offensive stance.

He continued to run. He had already run for a great many days. He did not know how far he had traveled in this space, but there was practically no change in the surrounding scenery at all. Massive stars were all around them, and the whole space was barren and silent.

‘Huh?’

He paused suddenly, and saw that a multicolored light was actually gushing out ahead of him, looking incredibly beautiful and amazing.

He took a few more steps forwards. He had instantly left millions and millions of km behind him. There was a mysterious Regulations of Space in this place. Otherwise, there would definitely be no way that the neutral zone could be this huge.

Now, he could see clearly. The object that was gushing out multicolored light was actually a cube, but this cube was made up of 27 smaller cubes, and every cube was of a different color.

Upon a closer look, every smaller cube was further made up of 27 even smaller cubes, and in that manner, they split on and on, without end or bounds, and an eye would occasionally appear on the face of the cube that faced Ling Han, which looked extremely profound.

Ling Han merely glanced at it, and his complete attention was drawn to it. He actually forgot that there were still 12 elites pursuing him from behind.

However, he was a Monarch Star, after all. When the frightening gust of attack approached, he still reacted in time, and hurriedly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Golden light flowed all over his body, and ancient seals appeared one after another.

Peng, he was instantly sent flying, but was not wounded at all. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This is…” Meng Feicheng and the others had also seen that cube, and just like Ling Han, they also looked dazed.

Ling Han had completely gotten his wits back, and couldn’t help but exclaim internally at how amazing it was to actually cause his attention to be completely absorbed.

“The Core of heaven and earth!” This exclamation was heard from Meng Feicheng’s mouth.

However, the moment he spoke these words, he immediately looked regretful. He had really been too excited, or there would’ve been absolutely no way that he would have leaked such an enormous secret with his subtlety.

Meanwhile, Liu Sanbian smirked coldly. “Meng Feicheng, it is just not you that knows the secret of the Core of heaven and earth. Moreover, my ancestor has also predicted that this Core of heaven and earth is named… the Origin Magic Cube!”

“However, this world is ultimately merely created from the clash of two Realms, and cannot be truly considered a great world, so the power of heaven and earth is only Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

Only Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier?

His tone was filled with contempt and disdain. Actually, it was not that his scope was very high, but rather because when the Celestial King behind him said this, that was the tone he had used, and Liu Sanbian subconsciously imitated that tone.

Otherwise, how could a mere Fifth Secret actually dare to cast contempt on the power of the Heavenly Venerable Tier?

This sounded very shocking, but upon further pondering, even a Heavenly Venerable Tier could only reign above Regulations, and they were still extremely negligible in front of the power of heaven and earth. However, the power of heaven and earth in this place was only at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, which was extremely far off from genuine great worlds like the Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm.

But when Ling Han heard this, he revealed a stunned expression.

A treasure of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier?

“You must obtain this Origin Magic Cube!” Small Tower suddenly spoke up. This world had restrictions on all below the Immortal Palace Tier. Even if it was a Heavenly Venerable Tier Tool, it was not willing to stand against it.

That was because even if this heaven and earth was not complete, its power was still endless and boundless, surpassing all individuals.

Small Tower did not even communicate anything mentally, and that was precisely because it did not want to be targeted by the heaven and earth here. Yet at this moment, it had suddenly spoken, which showed just exactly how important this Origin Magic Cube was.

Ling Han nodded. He had come for the treasure here in the first place, so there was naturally no reason for him to give it up. However, he asked mentally, “What can it be used for?”

“If you can refine this treasure, your cultivation level will directly soar to the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, but your Dao will only be limited to that level,” Small Tower said. “However, the Origin Magic Cube is the core of this heaven and earth, and can completely control this heaven and earth. If you can obtain it, you will be master of this heaven and earth!

“Studying the channeling of this heaven and earth, you will have a chance of touching the level above Regulations… and that is the Heavenly Venerable Tier!

“Of course, this heaven and earth is not complete, and is very backward. The level you will be able to grasp will definitely not be very high, but it will still be extremely helpful.”

Ling Han nodded. No wonder all the great forces had sent out their outstanding descendants and disciples into this space. They had all come for the Origin Magic Cube.

Thus, he was even more determined to obtain it.

Xiu, Meng Feicheng was the first to charge out, grabbing out at the Origin Magic Cube. However, the Origin Magic Cube was as massive as a star. This rush from him was just like an ant charging forwards to move a great mountain, appearing to have bitten extremely much more than he could chew.

“Humph, this is mine!” Liu Sanbian also moved as well. He had heard his elders say that the Origin Magic Cube was connected to the great secret of the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and definitely could not be missed.

If they could obtain this treasure, the Liu Clan would definitely flourish for generations, and surpass all Celestial Kings, becoming the true great emperor at the pinnacle of this world.

“It is ours!” The Nine Tigers of Chang Clan were no exception, either. The nine of them worked together like they were one and the same.

At present, they could no longer be bothered about Ling Han.

Yet Ling Han smirked coldly. The power of Regulation of these 12 people was close to complete exhaustion.. They were just waiting to be beaten by him one by one.
