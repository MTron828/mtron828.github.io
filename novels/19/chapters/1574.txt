1575 Creating a new pill recipe

Ling Han and his group rode the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, and returned to Sea Space Planet. They had not even rested when they saw Wu Jue had sought them out. He pounced straight at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and the result was naturally him being picked up by Ling Han by the scruff of his neck and thrown out.

“You damn guy, you’ve gone too far!” The little bottom’s expression was one filled with grievance.

“Che, you wanted to embrace my wife, and claim that I’ve gone too far?” Ling Han laughed.

“Your thoughts are too filthy; I only missed Sister too much!” the little bottom exclaimed angrily.

“Just give up the thought; it’s not possible.” Ling Han shook his head.

Wu Jue was about to say something else when he suddenly discovered Empress Luan Xing. His eyes couldn’t help but pop, his mouth half gaping, showing an incredibly stunned expression. Immediately, he scampered over to her, and said, “Sister, my name is Wu Jue, what’s your name?”

The Empress was proud, and didn’t even cast a look at him. Yet, this completely stirred up the little bottom’s true nature, and he wanted even more to worship her.

“Don’t think about this one, either; it’s still my wife!” Ling Han wrapped an arm around the Empress’s slender waist, and her austere expression washed away as she smiled sweetly at him.

“Ah!” The little bottom pounded the ground tragically. In his heart, the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden who was both sister and mother to him was this guy’s wife, and the exquisite beauty that had just caused his heart to throb, and ignited the seeds of love in him was also this guy’s wife. Why was it that all the good women of this world were all taken by this bastard?

Mo Li walked over, and patted the little bottom’s head. Then, she said to Ling Han, “When you fought me previously, you have not gone all out.” She was slightly displeased. As a king tier, she hated it when people took it easy on her.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “That is my ultimate move. If I use it, it would mean that either I or my enemy would die. In a spar, it is not suitable to use it.”

Only then was Mo Li appeased. She nodded. “When I am stronger, I will seek you out for another spar.”

Tan Mo’s appearance allowed her to see that she was far from reaching the limits of the Eternal River Tier. Before breaking through to the Genesis Tier, she still had a very wide space for improvement.

“All right,” Ling Han replied casually.

Mo Li brought the little bottom away with her, while Ling Han, the Empress, and the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden settled down, and took some time to enjoy some delicious food. Cultivation was not the only thing in life; one should still take the chance to enjoy themselves when one could.

A few days later, Ling Han suddenly felt like he was being watched, but no matter how hard he searched, he could not find the source of this feeling, which was a little strange to him.

However, there was a Demon Master standing by here, and he was a big shot among Yellow Demons at that. There were not many people that were qualified to come here to commit crime. Ling Han thought for a moment, and then put the matter aside. He had a more important matter he had to deal with at present.

Creating a new pill recipe.

The alchemical pills that he possessed now did not really suit his needs. Though they could increase the accumulation of Origin Power, it was much, much too slow, and there was too little Saintly medicine. Waiting for the Reincarnation Tree to bear fruit would be even slower; furthermore, the number of fruit would be limited.

In truth, the Saintly medicine’s main use was to increase the comprehension of great dao, and not the accumulation of Origin Power. To the majority of cultivators, this was rather the easiest part to be resolved.

On the other hand, merely increasing one’s Origin Power, and neglecting the comprehension of cultivation level would be like a child brandishing a supremely power Divine Sword; not only would he be unable to control the Divine Sword, he would hurt himself instead.

This would be just like one’s cultivation level not having increased, and the space was limited, yet he was still insisting on stuffing in a huge volume of Origin Power, and the only result would be stuffing himself to the point of bursting.

But Ling Han was different. His comprehension ability was extremely high in the first place, and he also had the Reincarnation Tree, so he could drink Reincarnation Tree. What he needed was the accumulation of Origin Power.

Because this was too unique, aside from some specific Divine Fruits, such as the Red Clear Fish Fruit, there was no alchemical pill that would have that kind of effect. It was too impractical. Their ancestors didn’t even bother to study this field, and even if they did get some result from their studies, it would be poison to others.

Perhaps the Celestial Realm had this kind of pill recipe, but because the ancient realm had broken up, this recipe had long since been lost in the passage of time.

Thus Ling Han wanted to create this kind of alchemical pill.

Previously, he had grasped the pharmacology of all the medicinal ingredients. In theory, anyone would be able to create a pill recipe as long as he had enough time to delve into the field. Furthermore, he was the Alchemy Emperor, and he also had something nature-defying like the Reincarnation Tree.

Ling Han went into seclusion to create something out of nothing, and come up with a new pill recipe.

This was a challenge, but for an Alchemy Emperor who had grasped all pharmacology, this was not a dilemma that had no solution.

Time passed quietly, and already a year had flown by. Ling Han was still working hard on brainstorming about the new pill recipe in the Black Tower. Occasionally, he would come out and spar with either Mo Li or the Empress. He would not simply focus on alchemy, and neglect his martial arts.

He already had a model in mind, but he had not completely confirmed it. There were still a lot of details that he had to examine.

However, he only planned to have himself and the Empress ingest this alchemical pill. Thus, he was also dealing with it, keeping their special conditions in mind, so he could ignore some things, such as the violent nature of the medicinal effects. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Their physiques were astonishingly strong, and belonged to the category that would not easily “get sick because of bad food”. Thus, it was fine even if the medicinal effects were a little violent; there was no need to worry about this aspect.

Every time Ling Han moved around outside, he would always feel like he was being stared at. The farther he was from the Chaotic Demon Palace, the stronger this feeling would be. It was like someone wanted to take the chance to make a move on him, but because he was not sure of his chances, he continued to stay in hiding.

Could it be Hu Feng?

After this thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind, he shook his head. Firstly, he was already in the Netherworld, and according to reason, Hu Feng should not be able to predict his whereabouts any longer, and secondly, if Hu Feng was here, he was practically like an ultra bright pillar of light in the Netherworld, lighting up whatever place he was at, so how could there possibly be no hint of anything unusual?

Or could it be someone from the Tan Clan?

Ouyang Taishan had gone off to play the role of mediator, and warn off this Forbidden Land from acting recklessly. Perhaps, they might have appeared to have agreed, but secretly sent out assassins. As long as they could do things cleanly, who would be able to accuse them of having killed him?

Ling Han smirked internally. If anyone dared jump out and make trouble for him, as long as he reached the Genesis Tier, he would use the power boost from the Black Tower, and directly kill them.

F***, did they really think that he was a pushover?

A few days later, a golden pathway stretched out from the galaxy. Ouyang Taishan had arrived. He had a conversation with Ling Han, and told him that he had resolved most of his problems. He was only waiting for him to agree, and he would be able to join the Heaven Crushing Alliance.

However, because Ling Han’s present cultivation level was a little low, the powerful figures in the alliance did not agree to give him the position of Seventeenth Elder.

“What those old guys mean is for you to first enter into the Green River Valley and cultivate, and when you reach the Genesis Tier, they will promote you to an elder,” Ouyang Taishan explained.

Ling Han was not surprised. He was only in the Eternal River Tier. If those genuine big shots really agreed for him to become an elder, that would be the real surprise; that would be too embarrassing for them. He asked, “Senior, what is the Green River Valley?”

“Oh, it is a Mystery Realm that our few Forbidden Lands have worked together to open up. It is especially used to nurture the younger generation in hopes of having more Genesis Tiers appear so that they would be of help in future,” Ouyang Taishan stated calmly.

They could nurture even Genesis Tiers?
