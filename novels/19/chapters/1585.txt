Chapter 1586: Gu Feng’s true face

Inside the Black Tower.

Gu Feng’s face was filled with shock. The expanse of this Spatial God Tool rendered even him speechless.

He raised his head, and saw that there were only two colors—black and white—interwoven in the skies. Those were the Regulations of the Immortal Realm and Netherworld. Because they were opposites, they had taken form and were opposing each other in this manner.

He was even more stunned. This Spatial God Tool could actually accommodate the Regulations of two Realms at the same time—this was too incredible.

“Come, I’ll take you around on a tour.” A strange smile curled up the corners of Ling Han’s lips as he led Gu Feng on a stroll. On the way, he gave an introduction. One year was equivalent to 1,000 years for the herbs growing in this place, and once in a while, something the likes of the five element life force would also be nurtured here.

Gu Feng was completely speechless, and followed Ling Han around like he was a dead fish.

If anyone suddenly found out all this, they would definitely go numb with shock.

Finally, Ling Han brought Gu Feng to the Reincarnation Tree. The Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were presently cultivating in isolation beneath the tree, and now that the Reincarnation Tree had been upgraded, one day was equivalent to 10 years of cultivation. Furthermore, there was also a boost to the numbers it could accommodate at the same time, reaching as many as 20 people. Thus, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden finally did not have to compete with the nine doppelgangers of the Empress.

“This is the Reincarnation Tree,” Ling Han introduced. “For those comprehending Dao beneath the tree, one day is equivalent to as long as 10 years.”

A muscle twitched in Gu Feng’s cheek. “No wonder your cultivation level is already approaching the Genesis Tier when you yourself are less than 500 years old!”

Ling Han smiled. The Reincarnation Tree was only one of the reasons. He had continuously risked life and limbs all these years, venturing into various Mystery Realms in search of fortune. This was the fundamental reason for his rapid advance through the cultivation levels.

However, since Gu Feng was determined to think that all this was due to the Reincarnation Tree, then he would just let him have that misunderstanding.

In any case... hoho.

“Ling Han, do you trust me so much to bring me into such a precious treasure?” Gu Feng broke into a smile, incredibly carefree. This definitely was sincere.

“For someone who can step out and stand up in support of me in that kind of situation, why can I not trust him? Moreover—”

Peng!

Ling Han had yet to finish his words when Gu Feng unexpectedly moved suddenly, and shot out a punch at his back.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Gu Feng did not spare him even though he was at the advantage, and repeatedly attacked. His fists were wrapped with dazzling light, and he endlessly attacked Ling Han. He was a Demon Master, and be it in terms of power or Regulations, he far overwhelmed Ling Han. Unless Ling Han channelled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he would definitely be killed after 10 blows at most.

His cultivation level had advanced further, so he naturally would be able to sustain more attacks from a Demon Master than before.

Ling Han stood proudly, and did not dodge. Neither did he parry the attacks. He simply allowed Gu Feng to attack him as much as he liked.

After attacking 100 times, Gu Feng couldn’t help but pale in shock. Was this a f****** monster? What Eternal River Tier could continuously bear so many attacks from a Genesis Tier? More importantly, he did not sense that Ling Han had made any move to channel any Origin Power.

At this time, Ling Han slowly turned around. Tremendous shock filled Gu Feng’s heart, and he quickly retreated 300 meters away, maintaining vigilance.

Ling Han shook his head, smiling, and said, “You are too anxious; why not wait until I finish saying my words to make your move! That’s right, where was I just now? Oh, and moreover, additionally, I am the supreme ruler here in this place. If anyone conspires against me, I will be able to easily kill him!”

“Humph!” Small Tower appeared, appearing to be very displeased.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Couldn’t you allow me to pretend for once? You have to come out to dampen my spirits! Fine, fine, fine, you are the true supreme ruler of the Black Tower, and I can only control the Black Tower through you.”

Yet Gu Feng had completely paled in shock. “Tool Spirit! This Celestial Tool has a Tool Spirit! Impossible, even if there is a Tool Spirit, how could it possibly recognize an ant like you as its master?”

This was a Celestial Tool, a high and noble Celestial Tool that could even kill lower tier Celestial Kings, and it would actually recognize an Eternal River Tier as master. How could he believe that?

“You care about too much business that is not yours!” Small Tower stated coldly, looking completely proud.

Gu Feng took a deep breath, and exclaimed, “Tool Spirit, recognize me as your master! I am 100, 1,000 more outstanding than he is, and I will definitely be able to help you return to glory! Let us join forces, and create our own prosperity and success in the Celestial Realm!”

“Retard!” Small Tower shook slightly. “I can’t be bothered with him, I’m leaving.”

With a light wave, it suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Gu Feng was anxious, and wanted to pursue it, but he had absolutely no idea where he should go to chase after it.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “It’s about time for you to show your true face, right?”

At this time, the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden also stopped cultivating, and stood on either side of Ling Han as they stared coldly at Gu Feng.

“True face? What do you mean!” Gu Feng calmed down.

Ling Han was unhurried. In any case, he had as much time as he wanted, and said, “You and I could be considered total strangers, yet you would actually step forward so bravely for my sake... Hoho, I believe that there are indeed such people in this world, but I definitely do not believe that you are one of them.”

“Why?” Gu Feng asked solemnly.

“Because when we first met, there was something odd about the gaze you directed at me,” Ling Han replied.

“That’s your only reason?”

“This naturally is only one of the reasons,” Ling Han continued. “Thus, I drew you into the Black Tower. If you had been a good guy, being able to go so far for the sake of a complete stranger, it would’ve been all right for me to let you know the secret of the Black Tower. I could even allow you to enjoy the benefits of the Black Tower as well.

“If you had truly been as I had guessed, don’t forget, in this place, I am the master.”

“Ahem!” A cough rang out from Small Tower.

This proud tower was really too petty.

Gu Feng did not speak. He directed his gaze at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and Empress Luan Xing, an ominous glint in his eyes.

“Don’t think of taking them hostage, because you will not be able to do so.” Ling Han shook his head. “Actually, it is not difficult to guess your identity.”

“Go ahead and tell me,” Gu Feng said solemnly.

“The words ‘ancient’ and ‘moon’ combine to become Hu, and ‘wood’ and ‘wind’ together is Feng[1],” Ling Han said with a smile. “Hu Feng, fancy that you would actually pursue me all the way into the Netherworld, and you even found me. Furthermore, you changed your appearance and entered into the Green River Valley as well!”

Gu Feng’s body shook, and he did not say a word. Light slightly flickered on his body. Immediately, there was a massive change to his features. What had initially been tanned skin turned fair, with a kind of elegance and otherworldly air to him.

Hu Feng, the strongest prodigy from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han clapped his hands, and said, “I have to admit that I am impressed. You managed to grasp the Regulations of the Netherworld so quickly, and have even increased your cultivation level to Demon Master level.”

Hu Feng humphed. When he had first entered into the Netherworld, he had been continuously hunted down by beings of the Netherworld, and the Regulations of the Immortal Realm he had grasped were also worn down endlessly by the heaven and earth of this realm. Thus, he simply began to cultivate the great dao of the Netherworld.

In the first place, he was already standing at the height of Saint, so cultivating the great dao of the Netherworld was naturally a matter of half the work with twice the effect. In a short few years, his power had returned to the Genesis Tier, and he had become a Demon Master, but he had also fitted into the Netherworld perfectly.

For the sake of the treasures in Ling Han’s possession, he changed his appearance, and drew the attention of the Heaven Crushing Alliance with his talent. He was then drawn into the Green River Valley. At first, he wanted to find a chance to kill Ling Han secretly, and rob the latter of all his treasures, but he had never imagined that Ling Han would actually be such a troublemaker.

You were really a f******* bearer of bad luck, causing him to have no choice but to take a gamble, and step forward bravely at the most crucial moment to speak up for you, Ling Han.

He knew that Ling Han had in his possession a Celestial Tool which could be concealed and had no form. At least, even a Saint like himself could find no traces of it.

If Ling Han “had no conscience”, and didn’t take him with him, he would then reveal his identity. The Hu Clan was also a member of the Heaven Crushing Alliance. Worse come to worst, he would only be reprimanded, and would not have any life-threatening danger.
