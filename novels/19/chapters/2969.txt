2970 Swept Away

Yet Gou Li showed an expression of delight at Ling Han’s misfortune, and said with a smile, “Teacher Ma Bang, Teacher Ye Hongcheng, Teacher Shi Gang, not only are they all fourth severance grand elders, their teacher is Zhu Mang, Lord Zhu!”

He paused, looked towards Ling Han, and said slowly, “These three have extreme respect for Lord Zhu. You tampered with Lord Zhu’s sword technique, so they will definitely seek you out for an accounting.”

As he spoke, Ma Bang and the others had already walked over.

“So this is the one?” Ye Hongcheng pointed at Ling Han, his expression very unfriendly.

He naturally had a reason to be furious. Previously, he had suddenly received news that someone had tampered with his teacher’s sword technique, and had even led others to make changes as well. His anger immediately spiked up. How could he tolerate that?

Hence, he immediately ran over. Unexpectedly, Ma Bang and Shi Gang had also run over as soon as they heard the news, coincidentally encountering each other.

“Three teachers, it was this person that tampered with Lord Zhu’s sword technique,” Gou Li hurriedly said.

Zhu Bang and the others all glared fiercely at Ling Han, as if he was some extremely evil and vicious character.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and moved as he willed. “What’s wrong with that?”

Zhu Bang and the others didn’t immediately attack. Instead, they asked around first, and found out that Ling Han’s modification of the sword technique had indeed greatly increased the might of the original sword technique. They couldn’t find any fault with this, and even if they wanted to flip out, they couldn’t find any reason to do so.

Shi Gang said, “Since you’re so smart, come and modify this sword technique. ‘Violent Wind Rising Waves’ was created by Master when he was at the Dividing Soul Tier. It was even hailed by several lords of Immortal Palace Tier as a world-suppressing treasured art.”

When the three Severing Mundane Tier grand elders arrived, the disciples that had just dispersed naturally all ran back, continuing to watch the excitement. When they heard Shi Gang’s words, they couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

Just listen, just where did this sword technique come from?

Even the Immortal Palace Tier elites were full of praise for it. This undoubtedly gave Ling Han tremendous pressure. To say nothing of whether he could improve it, even if he could, would he dare? Wouldn’t that be equivalent to slapping the faces of the Immortal Palace Tier elites?

Ling Han scoffed. “Not interested.”

“How dare you!!” Shi Gang raised his voice. “Then hurry up and kneel down, and apologize to our lord master!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “And what is the basis for that, then?”

“Since you are unable to modify ‘Violent Wind Rising Waves,’ it means that you were just putting on a pretense previously,” Ye Hongcheng said calmly.

“Kneel!” Ma Bang shouted harshly, his voice exploding all of a sudden, just like a sudden clap of thunder.

If Ling Han had really been a Genesis Tier elite, he would definitely have fallen to his knees with this shout. This was the deliberate targeting of a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder. However, in front of a dignified Heavenly Venerate, what could this shout do?

Ling Han acted as he liked. At first, he had not planned to target anyone, but seeing these three people being so aggressive, his anger naturally rose.

He grinned at the thought. “And if I don’t kneel?”

“You think you can rebel?” Ma Bang moved, grabbing out at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually waved his hand, and xiu, Ma Bang was sent flying, instantly turning into a small black dot, and disappearing on the horizon.

This!

Everyone was dumbfounded. A Severing Mundane Tier grand elder had been sent flying to the horizon by a Genesis Tier with a wave of his hand; were they dreaming?

“As a teacher, you should set an example. Your duty is to teach others, and not to commit violence,” Ling Han lectured Shi Gang and Ye Hongcheng.

The two of them trembled in fear. Their strength was equal to Ma Bang’s, and even Ma Bang was no match for a single strike from Ling Han. Then, it had to be the same for them as well.

This guy wasn’t a Genesis Tier cultivator, but definitely a poser who came to do some seal clubbing[1]!

“Let’s go!”

The two of them hurriedly retreated, and seeing that Ling Han had no intention to stop them, they couldn’t help but run even faster.

“Do you know that you’ve gotten into big trouble!” Cheng Sisi looked at Ling Han smilingly. “Those three are the strongest elites of the branch academy. If they’re outmatched, they’ll definitely go to the main branch to find stronger people, such as Dividing Soul Tier, or even… Lord Zhu Mang himself!”

Zhu Mang had already nurtured two Dividing Soul Tier and 17 Severing Mundane Tier disciples, and there were even more people that he had been a teacher to, and they were the elders or even the clan leaders of the various great clans. If these people were alerted, then Ling Han’s actions would be equivalent to opposing the entire Peaceful Leaf City.

“Come and beg me. If my heart suddenly softens, perhaps I may speak up for you.” She was intrigued. If she could subdue such an intractable man, it would be a very great accomplishment to her.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You’re just a little girl, so what can you do?”

“You dare to look down on me?” Cheng Sisi raised a brow, showing a hint of anger.

“Are you the clan leader of the Cheng Clan, or an Immortal Palace Tier elite?” Ling Han’s question caused Cheng Sisi to choke, and then he continued, “So, what use are your words?”

“I…” Cheng Sisi glared angrily at Ling Han. If she really decided to help Ling Han, she would definitely act spoiled and have the clan leader of the Cheng Clan step out to apologize to Zhu Mang on his behalf. She was sure that this matter could still be considered resolved with that. However, Ling Han actually dared to speak of her in this manner, causing her to completely lose the mood to plead on Ling Han’s behalf.

“Who cares if you die!” She humphed, and turned her head, appearing to be extremely proud.

Ling Han did not take it to heart at all. He crossed one leg over the other, and waited to see what would happen.

This could be seen as a test for Cheng Sisi. The test was naturally whether she was worthy of Ling Duanyun—what was the use of mere beauty? There was no shortage of beautiful women in this world.

From how things looked now, Cheng Sisi’s performance was not a passing grade at all.

After a short while, another seven people came. Aside from Shi Gang and Ye Hongcheng, there were also two Severing Mundane Tier grand elders, while the other three were Dividing Soul Tiers.

These seven people were all disciples of Zhu Mang. When they found out that someone had dared to insult their master, and had even sent a junior brother flying, they were naturally all infuriated beyond belief.

“Who exactly are you, sir?” a Dividing Soul Tier asked.

“And who are you?” Ling Han countered.

The Dividing Soul Tier revealed a hint of anger, but suppressed it. “I am Liu Jun.”

“Oh, what business do you have with me?” Ling Han asked very casually.

Liu Jun was almost angered to death. ‘Just now, it was already enough that you did not reveal your own name, but now that I have already announced my name, you still do not pay any heed to it. Are you deliberately playing around with me?’

“Senior Brother, like I said, there is no need to be reserved with this kind of madman. Just apprehend him directly,” a Dividing Soul Tier beside him said, appearing extremely impatient.

“All right. We will apprehend him first.” Liu Jun nodded.

At first, he had wanted to use diplomacy before resorting to force. After all, Ling Han had sent Ma Bang flying with a single strike, and the strength that he had displayed was incredibly amazing. However, Ling Han had not shown the slightest bit of friendliness, so he felt that there was no need to have a peaceful conversation with Ling Han.

“Let’s attack together!”

The three great Dividing Soul Tiers attacked Ling Han at the same time, wanting to take him down in one go.
