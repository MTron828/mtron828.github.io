Chapter 1546 Stoking the flames.

Gou Li was confident in himself, and believed that he would definitely be able to reach Dao in future, and enter into the Demon Master Tier that everyone dreamed of.

However, he was presently only in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and those seated high up on the stone chairs were either king tiers in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier or veteran elites that were in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier.

He was still too inexperienced now, and was not qualified to compete with these people yet.

‘In future, I will definitely be able to sweep all of you outside, but now, I will restrain myself,’ he thought internally, but he had not foreseen that Ling Han would suddenly raise his voice, and shout incredibly loudly.

Shua, suddenly, all eyes turned towards them—of course, some of their eyes fell on Ling Han, but Gou Li was definitely the center of their attention.

What had this to do with him!

Gou Li grimaced internally. Previously, he had tricked Ling Han, and had initially thought they had formed a friendship from being thieves together when they had “fled” together. He had already put Ling Han out of his mind, but he did not think that this guy had not forgotten at all. He was screwing him over at this moment.

“What are you guys looking at? Don’t you know that my Brother Li is known as a King Tier Assassin? If you continue to look, he will stomp on all of you, and you will be forced into submission!” Ling Han looked completely like a lackey that was making use of his powerful connection as an intimidation tactic, and just the mere sight of him was infuriating.

“Is that right?” A young man wearing a blue shirt walked out of the crowd. His hair was crimson red, his expression sinister, and his eyes were focused on Gou Li.

‘What are you looking at me for?’

Gou Li chuckled, and said, “This brother of mine likes to boast. Everyone, you do not have to take it seriously; just do whatever you should be doing, just ignore us.”

“Hoho, boasting so greatly just now, and now you’re shrinking back?” Another young man walked out, yet his hands were a pair of panther paws, and he was about three heads taller than the average person.

“Come, I really would like to see how this ‘Brother Li’ plans to stomp on all of us.” A third young man leaped out. His complexion was especially pale, yet his eyes were jade green. He looked like a venomous snake.

Gou Li quickly waved his hand, and laughed. “It was a joke, just a joke!”

“Brother Li, are you even a man? You can tolerate that?” Yet Ling Han was simply adding fuel to the fire. He was determined to start this fire at all costs. “Go on, they are just three pests. Brother Li, you can defeat them even with only one hand!”

“Is that right?” These three people smirked coldly. In truth, they were not stupid, and knew that Ling Han was deliberately stoking the flames, but if a newcomer had come, they naturally had to estimate the latter’s abilities.

“Come and fight me!” The snake-eyed man moved first. He stretched out both arms, but it seemed as if they were boneless as they could endlessly twist and bend, which was impossible to defend against effectively.

Gou Li frowned, yet had no choice but to move. After all, he could not allow others to beat him, right?

Ling Han hurriedly scurried off to one side. He had successfully stoked the fire, so it was naturally time for him to watch the show now.

But just as he was watching with much interest, the panther paw man pointed the arrow straight at him. “Brat, you are bouncing around a lot!”

“No, no, just a little.” Ling Han was very humble.

“Those who are weak are not qualified to stand on this platform!” The panther paw man moved brazenly. The general atmosphere of the whole Netherworld was far ruder and more unreasonable than in the Immortal Realm. They would come to blows at the slightest disagreement.

Ling Han sighed. Stretching out the index and middle fingers of his right hand, he began to fight the other.

He was using the Lightning Sword Technique, but the Lightning Sword Technique was based on speed, and combined with the power of lightning he had formed through observing heavenly tribulation. However, both these traits were established on the Regulations of the Immortal Realm.

Thus, its might that could be displayed was greatly weakened.

Ling Han was indifferent. His opponent was only in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, so he could simply play around with him, and use him to increase his grasp of the Regulations of the Netherworld.

The nine big shots on the stone chairs only cast a look at him before withdrawing their attention. This kind of battle was absolutely not worth their attention, but the time for the treasure exchange was not here yet, so they did not stop them. In any case, were cultivators not produced through continuous battles?

Gou Li was indeed awesome. He had dealt with the snake-eyed man in over 100 moves, but the battle between Ling Han and the panther paw man was incredibly drawn out, and also extremely confusing to the spectators.

It was clear that this guy did not have a high cultivation level. He only had slightly stronger power, and looked like he would quickly lose. But as it happened, he still managed to hang on continuously, which caused the spectators to click their tongues in amazement.

“Have you all realized that this guy’s strength seems to be slightly stronger than when he had just started?”

“Yi, now that you’re saying it, it seems like that really is the case!”

Everyone turned to look at each other, and couldn’t help but look stunned.

This was too bizarre. Although the majority of king tiers were the type to use battles to develop themselves, and their abilities would improve faster the more they fought, it was nothing as exaggerated as Ling Han was now.

After a battle, no matter what, one should go into seclusion for a few months or even a few years, summarize their inadequacies in the battle, and improve on that basis. Naturally, one’s abilities would improve slightly.

But in Ling Han’s case?

Whilst fighting, he was also improving on his own abilities. Just what kind of freak was this?

This kind of natural talent at cultivation was practically nature-defying!

Yet it was them that were thinking too much. Ling Han’s cultivation level had been in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier in the first place, but his grasp of the Regulations in the Netherworld was still maintained at the low extreme. Thus, the more of a grasp he had on the Regulations of the Netherworld, the further his abilities would naturally improve.

Fighting with the panther man was a process for him to quickly grasp the Regulations of the Netherworld.

But others did not know that. After half a day had passed, Ling Han could already manage a counter for every 10 moves compared to when he initially had to stay on complete defense. Then, it slowly became that he could counterattack for every nine moves, then eight moves, and he was becoming stronger and stronger.

This caused even those big shots seated high up to raise an eyebrow. If this guy was allowed to continuously fight on like this, would he directly fight his way all the way up to the Demon Master Tier?

A day later, Ling Han was no longer at a disadvantage at all.

The panther paw man stopped in shock. If they continued fighting, Ling Han would surpass him in strength, and just the thought of this was enough to frighten him.

Ling Han was discontented. “Why aren’t you fighting anymore?”

‘Like hell, is there such a freak like you?’

The panther paw man did not answer, and directly sank into the crowd. He couldn’t fight him, but could still avoid him, right?

Gou Li returned, looked at Ling Han, and then seriously stated, “You are really a strange guy.”

“You are not ordinary, either. Even I don’t know how strong you are exactly,” Ling Han retorted solemnly.

“Filth King!” But in the next instant, Gou Li had dismissed all his seriousness.

“Chicken Thief!” Ling Han was unwilling to be outdone, either.

On a stone chair, a big shot said, “Cough, it’s about time. Let’s start exchanging treasures.”

He looked to be in his thirties, and was the oldest among all those gathered here. Thus, he was considered “a person with good moral standing and reputation”, and was host of the exchange this time round.

“Everyone, take out your treasures in turn. Those who are interested can place a bid, and trade their own item for it. It is up to the treasure’s owner to decide whom he wishes to trade with.” This big shot’s name was Guang Feichen, and was in the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. A hundred million years ago, he had already reached the consummate level, but his corresponding age was only about 30-plus, so he could be claimed to be in the prime of his youth, his vitality high.

“I was recommended by all to become host, so I shall get the ball rolling,” he said smilingly. Spreading out his right hand, there was a completely crimson fruit in his palm. “This is the Red Clear Fish Fruit, and can allow the cultivation level to be greatly boosted for Eternal River Tiers. However, its effects are extremely violent. Unless there is a Demon Master standing by to suppress them, only those who have reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier will be able to bear being barraged by its medicinal effects.”

When everyone heard this, they couldn’t help but shake their heads. This requirement was really too high. Asking the help of a Demon Master? How many could accomplish that!
