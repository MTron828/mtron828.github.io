Ling Han looked at Zhao Shuang smilingly, “What eternal antidote?”

‘Ah, you were the one who poisoned me, and you don’t know what the eternal antidote is?’

‘You can’t play around with me like this!’

Zhao Shuang hurriedly replied with a grin, “Aren’t I poisoned now? It has already been over 10,000 years. It has always been dormant inside my body, and I fear that there would be after-effects. What if some kind of residual trouble is left behind… I’ll be honest with you, Brother Long, I still have no children yet, so I’m afraid that it would affect the later generation.”

Ling Han felt an urge to burst out laughing. He had not expected that this guy’s personality would change so drastically in these 10,000 years. What was left of all his previous arrogance?

!!

Changing the topic, he asked further, “How many from the Ghost King City would be going?”

“Basically, every single Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be going. There are also a few of us, these juniors and descendants, that are able to go with them,” Zhao Shuang said.

“Are you?” Ling Han looked at him.

Zhao Shuang quickly shook his head, “Of course, I am not going. It’s so dangerous!”

F***, this cowardly brat.

Ling Han shook his head, and said smilingly, “Go back and tell your father that you have suddenly changed your mind, and wish to go with him.” Zhao Shuang’s old man was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so it was definitely no issue for him to bring some people with him.

“Ah?” Zhao Shuang pulled a long face. Who did not know this kind of place was the most dangerous? He really did not want to go in the slightest. In any case, it was fine since his old man had gone. Whatever they obtained, he would definitely manage to obtain a share of the profits.

In this way, there was no need for him to expend effort or take any risk either, and he would be able to reap what he has not sown. With something so good, wouldn’t it be very dumb for him to take the risk instead?

Ling Han clapped a hand on his shoulder, “No problems, right?”

“No,” Zhao Shuang could only shake his head. It couldn’t be helped that his life was grasped in Ling Han’s hands, right?

After Zhao Shuang returned, he indeed voiced out to Zhao Yuanyi that he wanted to go to the Ancient Tomb.

This caused Zhao Yuanyi pleasant surprise, because Zhao Shuang naturally would not say that he had been threatened, but rather that he suddenly felt that, as a man, and the descendant of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at that, he needed to be more courageous.

This naturally made Zhao Yuanyi feel very gratified. His son was finally showing some slight promise.

—If he knew that this was still because his son was afraid of dying, who knew just how furious he would be.

After a few days, Zhao Shuang came once more to seek out Ling Han, bringing some information with him.

Aside from the various great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, among the second-generation young masters, the Yin River Celestial King and Yang Xiaoling would both be going, and added with Zhao Shuang, these were the only three remaining descendants or disciples of the three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings of Ghost King City.

“I’ll just follow you and be a lackey,” Ling Han looked over the namelist, and said to Zhao Shuang, grinning.

Zhao Shuang could only grimace. How dared he treat this lord as a lackey?

Several days later, the main forces set out.

Ling Han mingled into the masses. Naturally, it was impossible that he would again take the form of Li Long, but it was not his true appearnce either. Instead, he had just randomly altered his appearance, then had Zhao Shuang get him a false identity.

The false identity that Zhao Shuang gave him was actually like a real identity. With the help of this kind of second-generation young master, what need was there for him to fear that he would not be able to pull off the deception?

The group was actually very massive. Merely in term sof Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, there were more than twenty. On the other hand, it was the group of second-generation young masters that was relatively smaller, comprising of Zhao Shuang and the other two, and added with some lackeys that they had brought with them, the total number was only over a dozen people.

Ling Han did not draw anyone’s attention. After all, he was just the lackey of a second-generation young master; who would care about him?

They flew the banner of the Desolate Moon Alliance, all of them seated on a warship. With Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings personally powering the warship, the speed was astonishingly quick. Furthemore, though the Celestial King Graveyard was extremely large, it was only a small world after all. No matter how big it was, there were still limits.

Three years later, they were finally drawing close to their destination. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings powering it personally, it actually still needed as many as three years?

Because this world was turned by the power of a Heavenly Venerate into an independent space, the Regulations of Space were also greatly affected. One could teleport, but this was only possible in short ranges. It was not possible to travel over great distances through teleportation.

Ling Han was sure that if he was journeying on his own, he would probably need around twenty years.

Firstly, his speed was considerably slower than Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and secondly, it was impossible that he could journey at full speed in a single stroke over twenty years without the slightest bit of rest at all.

Ahead of them, a gigantic, black-coloured swamp lay.

The warship stopped at the boundaries of the swamp and did not enter. Looking from midair, a black aura was wafting from the swamp. It looked like smoke as it turned into snake-like forms.

This was a land of death. It was said that even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could not barge in here, as this could be fatal and deadly.

The reason why Desolate Moon had gathered countless Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings together was so that they could conquer this whole area. That was because the Ancient Tomb was located in the most central zone of this swamp. Without sweeping aside all opposition in this swamp first, there would be no way for them to enter, so what was the point of speaking further of rewards?

Ling Han still did not know exactly what precious treasures lay inside this Ancient Tomb, or was Ancient the title of a certain elite, because Zhao Shuang had been unable to find out the exact details, no matter how hard he tried.
