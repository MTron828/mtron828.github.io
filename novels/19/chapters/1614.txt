Chapter 1615: Proposing marriage

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Since you know that I have the means to overwhelm a Saint King, why do you not fear that I would directly make a move to snatch it from you? In any case, I only want the horn of a True Dragon, so what need is there for me to go to so much trouble?”

“If you had been that kind of person, wouldn’t have you long since made your move?” Long Yushan countered.

“That may not be.” Ling Han shook his head. “To release the battle prowess of a Saint King, there is a need to pay a very heavy price. Do you think that this is something that a single horn from a True Dragon can compensate for?”

Long Yushan gritted her teeth, and asked, “Then what other condition do you want?”

Ling Han laughed mischievously, and deliberately revealed an evil look. Just as Long Yushan was about to fly into a rage, he shrugged, and said, “Fine, I agree. In any case, I don’t like that guy, either.”

Long Yushan was startled. Was he playing around with her? But since Ling Han had agreed, that was naturally best. She nodded, and said, “You must immediately make a marriage proposal to the clan, and I will add fuel to the fire so that you and Zhong Badu can use a battle to decide the matter. At that time, you can wound him, and I will be able to refuse your marriage proposal with the reason of not wanting to offend the Zhong Clan. At the same time, I will not need to obey the Zhong Clan, either.”

‘Your idea is quite good.’

Ling Han scratched his head. At any other time, offending a Forbidden Land to trade for a True Dragon horn was definitely an extremely poor deal, but who asked Zhong Badu to be the descendant of the Open Clouds King? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He despised the Open Clouds King very much in the first place, and Zhong Badu’s attitude also made him very displeased. Thus, he naturally would not mind moving to teach a lesson to this descendant of the Open Clouds King first.

“Deal.” He nodded.

“Here!” Long Yushan gripped a dragon horn on her head, and exerted effort. Pa, she snapped off a dragon horn. There was bright ruby-red blood seeping from the wound, but it was incredibly thick, and did not drip on the ground.

She tossed the dragon horn over to Ling Han.

Ling Han caught it, and couldn’t help but be slightly surprised. He asked, “Aren’t you afraid that I will run off now that I have gotten what I wanted?”

“I trust you.” After Long Yushan said this, she turned and left.

Ling Han stretched lazily. “Since that’s the case, I will put on a good performance.”

He exited the courtyard, and had someone pass on the message with his request to meet with the patriarch of the Long Tribe.

The Long Tribe patriarch was not the ancestor of the Long Tribe. That Medium Saint was busy cultivating all day round, so how could he possibly have the time to take charge of the trifle matters of the clan? Thus, the Long Tribe patriarch was an elite in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. He thought that he could not possibly break through to the Genesis Tier, so he set his mind on sitting in this position, and no longer dreamed extravagantly of becoming a Saint himself.

Very quickly, a servant brought the message that the Long Tribe patriarch would see him.

“Hoho, Friend Ling is really young and promising. It is said that you have cultivated for less than 1,000 years, and already possess such strength. This is really something that is impressive and would make others envious.” The Long Tribe patriarch met with Ling Han in the great hall.

He was a man that looked to be in his fifties. He looked very formidable and aggressive, and it was as if an ancient fierce beast was hidden inside his body. His battle prowess definitely made him a big shot among Eternal River Tiers.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “You’ve overpraised me. Lord Patriarch, I will not waste my breath either, and directly state the purpose of my visit.”

“Please.” The Long Tribe patriarch was still very polite. Though he did not think that Ling Han could be stronger than himself, both of them were in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, so he still had to give Ling Han some face.

Most importantly, Ling Han was too young. Since he had reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier at such a young age, then breaking through to the Saint Tier was not an impossible matter, either.

He naturally had to give some face to a future Saint.

Ling Han said, “I have come especially to bring a bridal gift.”

“Oh!” Realization dawned on the Long Tribe patriarch, and he was all smiles. He had long guessed this was the case. Xiangyue had brought him back with her, so could the significance be any clearer than that? Their Long Tribe was also the strongest force in this whole galaxy, and there was no need for them to use marriage to improve and strengthen their position. Thus, as long as Xiangyue wanted to, he naturally would be pleased to bring a romance to a happy ending.

Moreover, the possibility of Ling Han becoming a Saint in future was very high. The Long Tribe having such a son-in-law was naturally not deprecating to Long Xiangyue at all.

“Sit down first, and let us discuss slowly.” He beckoned him over, and his attitude towards Ling Han inevitably became considerably warmer.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han was surprised, and then immediately realized that this Lord Patriarch must have misunderstood. He coughed, and said, “Lord Patriarch, my marriage proposal is not for Miss Long Xiangyue.”

“Ah?” The Long Tribe patriarch was startled. The one he had his eye on was not Long Xiangyue? Then that was strange. Aside from Xiangyue, what other clansman of the Long Tribe was worthy of being a match for a prodigy like him?

“Then, the person you like is...”

“Long Yushan, Fairy Long.” Ling Han wore a bashful smile. F***, he was lying through his teeth here, and would be struck by lightning for his deceit.

This time, the patriarch of the Long Tribe was really surprised. He stared blankly at Ling Han, and did not know what he was supposed to say at this moment.

“Lord Patriarch?” Ling Han called out.

The patriarch of the Long Tribe came back to his senses, and answered, “Friend, Lady Yushan has long since been betrothed to another.”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “That’s fine. It is just a betrothal, so cancelling it would be all right.”

At this instant, the patriarch of the Long Tribe really wanted to deliver a slap straight to Ling Han’s face.

Cancel? He was saying it like it was so easy!

‘The fiance is from the Open Clouds Forbidden Land, where there is a Saint King overseeing them, and you actually said you want us to cancel it. Are you not afraid of the fiery fury of a Saint King?’

“Hoho, friend, you should not joke around,” the Long Tribe patriarch said with a forced smile, no longer wanting to converse with Ling Han. The latter was really dumb with his words.

“I’m not kidding,” Ling Han said smilingly.

“Do not speak of this matter again!” The Long Tribe patriarch gave a resolute rejection. Though he was not qualified to decide the marriage of a Saint of the clan, it was obviously impossible that he would offend a Saint King for the sake of a preposterous request from an Eternal River Tier.

No matter how he thought about it, it was impossible!

“I am very sincere in my request. Lord Patriarch had best reconsider.” Ling Han was very shameless. This task he had taken was clearly a job of a villain that would offend others, so he could only put on the act of a villain to the fullest extent.

“Friend, please immediately leave the Long Tribe!” the Long Tribe patriarch exclaimed coldly. This was not just forcing them to do something, but also pushing the Long Tribe into a fire pit.

“Sure, just hand Long Yushan over, and I will leave immediately.” Ling Han continued to behave shamelessly.

“You!!” The Long Tribe patriarch jumped to his feet. “Brat, where do you think this is? How could you be allowed to create trouble without reason like this!”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Lord Patriarch, calm down! Calm down!”

“Scram!” The Long Tribe patriarch could not hold back from making a move. He stretched out a hand to grab at Ling Han, and his palm instantly turned into a crimson dragon’s claw. Flames intertwined around his claw, and divine patterns bloomed as dragon’s might spread out intimidatingly.

Ling Han very casually stretched out a hand. Pa, he grabbed the extended claw of the Long Tribe patriarch. “Lord Patriarch, we can converse politely. There is no need to resort to force.”

The Long Tribe patriarch couldn’t help but be shocked. His hand had fallen into Ling Han’s grip, yet it actually could not move in the slightest. The gap in power between the two of them was definitely not just a small bit.

‘How is this possible?!’

He was in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, and the true bloodline of the Dragon Tribe ran in his veins. His battle prowess would definitely overwhelm his peers, but he actually could not fight back in the slightest against Ling Han. This was something that he could not accept at all.
