Chapter 2262: Arrival of Heavenly Venerate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han moved like a tiger that had rushed into a flock of sheep. With every punch, a Foreign Realm Celestial King would be killed.

Simple and violent.

The Celestial King Tier elites were actually like helpless lambs, completely incapable of fighting back?

Everyone’s scalp turned numb at this. It was as if Ling Han had become a Ninth-Heaven-level great demon, killing or sparing as he liked, with everything under his control.

The Celestial Realm’s Celestial Kings were all rueful. Who would have expected this moment? Ling Han had definitely been deliberately holding back, and waited until enough Kings of the Foreign Realm had come to finally brandish his butcher’s knife.

Thus, this was locking the gates and beating up the dog, a complete massacre.

No one could stop Ling Han. He was the master of this world. Unless a Heavenly Venerate interfered, or a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate arrived, who would be able to become his match?

Die! Die! Die!

Ling Han was like a demon from hell. In his eyes, not a single bit of mercy could be seen. The two Realms were enemies, and him killing the Foreign Realm cultivators was equivalent to saving his own home, so it was naturally impossible for him to have any mercy.

It was not just the Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm. Monarch Stars like Wu Xin, Sen Luo, and the others were also on Ling Han’s kill list. If these Monarch Stars were allowed to mature, they all could become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. In fact, it was possible that they could even become Heavenly Venerates.

“No!”

Peng.

Sen Luo had just exclaimed this one word when his head had exploded with a merciless punch from Ling Han. So what if he was a Monarch Star? In the face of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier power, he was just trash.

Ling Han was expressionless, manifesting millions of himself, and simultaneously hunting down all the cultivators of the Foreign Realm.

Nai You howled sharply, her three horns glowing at the same time, and seals brilliantly shining while forming a sea of light. Then, it was no use at all. With a tap of Ling Han’s finger,?pa, she turned into shattered bits.

Wu Xin fled madly, but a flash of sword light swept out towards and instantly caught up with him, slicing him into millions of pieces. He was deader than dead.

“Don’t even think of killing me!” Chi Xue roared loudly. He finally understood why there was such a gap between himself and Ling Han. The latter had hold of the Origin Magic Cube, and could kill even a Celestial King with a single punch, what more him, who was only at the 11th layer of Eighth Lotus.

He was defiant; he could not submit. He was a descendant of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan, indescribably noble and esteemed. How could he possibly die in this place?

He murmured softly, a strange power was surging. He was reciting the true name of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan.

It was very rare that the true name of a Heavenly Venerate was known to others because reciting it would lead to a great karmic reaction and a strong connection. However, Chi Xue was the descendant of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan, and the true name of this Heavenly Venerate was carved into his bloodline.

Chi Xue activated his bloodline, manifesting the true name of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan, which turned into a light that illuminated the whole world.

Reciting the name of a Heavenly Venerate would lead to great karma because a Heavenly Venerate was actually not recognized by the heaven and earth. After summoning a sliver of divine sense of his, he naturally would be targeted by the heaven and earth.

Ling Han immediately sensed it. A power that was so strong it caused his heart to shudder was presently becoming stronger endlessly.

It should be known that he presently was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. To make his heart shudder, just how strong would that power have to be?

Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan was about to appear!

Ling Han humphed, and with a thought,?pa, Chi Xue really turned into bits of blood, and the process of summoning the Heavenly Venerate was immediately stopped.

“No!” The Foreign Realm Kings were all roaring in fury. Chi Xue was really too important. Not only was he an invincible Monarch Star, he was also the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate.

“What are you howling for?” Ling Han asked coldly, and his manifestations moved at the same time, killing one Foreign Realm King after another.

However, a hole had still been forcibly ripped in the skies. A figure appeared, yet it was so pale that it was close to transparent. But even so, he was still exuding an incredibly strong aura, as if a single thought from him was capable of shattering this heaven and earth.

“Lord Chi Yan!” The members of the Foreign Realm that were still surviving all fell to their knees, their expressions filled with reverence.

This was the Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan of the Foreign Realm.

The members of the Foreign Realm were all overjoyed. As they saw it, a Heavenly Venerable Tier only had to appear, and there would be nothing that could not be resolved.

“Unlock the seal and let them go!” Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan spoke. Suddenly, a terrifying aura surged out, just like an earthquake or a tsunami.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grin. “Even if a sliver of divine sense from you truly descended, it is not certain that you would even be my match, what more when it is only a shadow now? Old geezer, just go somewhere you’re actually wanted; I will eventually chop off your wretched head one day!”

“How dare you!!”

“Insolence!!”

Those from the Foreign Realm all berated Ling Han furiously. He actually dared speak in such a manner to a supreme Heavenly Venerate; their flames of fury were completely ignited.

In the hearts of those from the Foreign Realm, Heavenly Venerable Tier was an indestructible god.

“This is my world, so scram!” Ling Han sent out a punch.?Boom, Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan’s shadow was immediately destroyed.

Those from the Foreign Realm were all gaping, rendered completely incapable of speech. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Though that was only the shadow of a Heavenly Venerate, not even a sliver of divine sense, to just watch as Ling Han destroyed it with a single punch still struck them a very powerful blow.

This was practically heaven-defying!

Ling Han humphed, and his eyes swept over them, his killing intent blazing.

A Heavenly Venerate had already been alerted. He definitely had to move as soon as possible. Otherwise, this Heavenly Venerate would very soon arrive. This new world would not be able to block a Heavenly Venerate, what more when the Foreign Realm did not just have a single Heavenly Venerate.

Peng, peng, peng. Multiple streaks of blood sprayed out, and no one was a match for Ling Han at all.

In merely the time for a few breaths, Ling Han had slaughtered all the beings of the Foreign Realm.

He was bathing in the blood of these enemies, standing proudly in the air. Even if he was just a lone figure, others still felt that even if thousands of troops came from the Foreign Realm, they would still be unable to compel him to take a step back.

Shen Chao came back to consciousness slowly. His legs were trembling as he said, “I submit, I submit, I submit.” Again and again, he repeated these words.

Ling Han humphed, and retorted, “You took advantage of your official position to avenge a personal grudge. If it were not for the fact that my strength is superior to you, I would have long since become a lonely ghost. Whom are you trying to deceive with those words? For a vile character like you to be alive is merely a waste of resources.”

His killing intent was still blazing, bearing the aura of having killed the various Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm. It was incredibly frightening.

Shen Chao had actually been scared to the point of pissing himself. It could not be helped. He was facing someone who was equivalent to a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Moreover, he had been terrified so many times previously, so all his courage had long since been frightened out of him. He no longer possessed a sliver of the bearing that a monarch tier should have.

“Please have mercy!” a Celestial Realm hurriedly spoke up. “This is a member of our Celestial Realm; you cannot render a personal punishment on him!”

No matter how many of the Foreign Realm Ling Han killed, it would be contributing to the Celestial Realm, but if he killed a comrade of the Celestial Realm, that would be a great crime, what more when Shen Chao was still a monarch tier. In the future, his accomplishments would definitely reach the Fifth Heaven Celestial King at least—a power that could not be overlooked.

Pa, Ling Han moved, and Shen Chao’s head immediately exploded, both form and spirit destroyed.

…He had already spared Shen Chao several times, but not only did the latter not curb himself, he even wanted to kill Ling Han now. Did he think that he was made out of clay, and had no temper, or was a saint?

The Celestial King who had spoken up couldn’t help but bear an ugly expression. He had some connections with the Celestial King of the Shen Clan, and had thus taken the initiative to speak up. He had not thought that Ling Han would not give him any face at all.

Hadn’t he just gotten extremely lucky, and obtained the Origin Magic Cube? As long as he left this place, the Celestial King would be able to crush this damn bug with a single finger.

However, it was only he that held this kind of displeasure. The others, including Celestial Kings, were all incredibly elated because they had killed over 130 Kings of the Foreign Realm in this battle, as well as a great many well-known figures of the enemy’s younger generation. This was definitely a heavy blow to the Foreign Realm.

If it was the Celestial Realm, they would probably need at least two to three epochs to be able to recover from this loss.

“Long live!” Everyone cheered.

Peng!

However, right at this moment, this world trembled, as if it was about to collapse.
