Chapter 1635: Merging the two Realms is forbidden by the Celestial Realm!

Though Ling Han was already beginning to believe the identity of this person, he still dared not have the slightest bit of carelessness. One should never be unalert, and it was best to be careful.

If she showed the slightest bit of malice, he would bring the Empress and the Rain Emperor with him into the Black Tower.

“Hu Niu asked you to come? What is it?” Ling Han asked.

The woman seriously answered, “You must stop what you have been doing just now!”

“Merging the two realms?” Ling Han was surprised. “Why?”

“I, too, am unsure of the exact reason, but this is something that the Young Imperial Empress has implored over and over again. The Young Imperial Empress said that merging the two Realms would draw out a great number of elites, and even the Roc Palace would not be able to protect you,” the woman said, a sliver of loathing in her eyes.

Going by the Young Imperial Empress’s tone, however much trouble this man created, the Roc Palace would still protect him at all costs.

Just how noble was the Young Imperial Empress? And she would actually take such great risks for an insignificant damn man like this?

Naturally, she despised Ling Han.

Ling Han ignored this woman and frowned slightly. The merging of the two Realms would actually alert the mighty figures of the Celestial Realm?

According to the information he had obtained, the reason that the Ancient Realm had been split into two was firstly, ineffable. It had been split in two, which caused resulting effects on the Celestial Realm, and sparked the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm. Secondly, the great turmoil took place in the Celestial Realm, which spread to the Ancient Realm, and thus caused the splitting of the Ancient Realm in two.

And now, the mighty figures of the Celestial Realm actually wanted to interfere and stop the merging of the Ancient Realm?

Hmm!

Ling Han pondered quietly. If this was the Celestial Realm, anyone would be able to become the core of the merging of the two Realms as long as they had reached the Genesis Tier. And with the background of the Celestial Realm, this could increase to a few hundred million, right? Then the merging of the two Realms would actually be something very simple.

...If it was claimed that when Severing Mundane Tiers and stronger elites entered into the Ancient Realm for too long, and suffered a backlash so their lifespans were no longer endless, Genesis Tiers were not affected. Furthermore, merging the two Realms would still be rewarded by the heaven and earth, and they would obtain great benefits. Why had this not been done by any force of the Celestial Realm?

The reason was just as this woman had said: a mighty figure of the Celestial Realm forbade it!

The Roc Palace was a Celestial King-level force, so if even Hu Niu had to deliberately send someone to inform him, what did this signify? The level of this mighty figure had to have reached Celestial King Tier, and the Roc Palace was unable to override him!

During the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm, it had involved great battles among Celestial King Tiers, and now it was a Celestial King that forbade the Ancient Realm from merging... could it be that it had really been the Celestial Realm that had split the Ancient Realm in two?

The reason why there had been a battle among the Celestial Kings was because some Celestial Kings disagreed with this action, which resulted in a conflict of ideas, and finally culminated in the great turmoil of the Celestial Realm.

Finally, the Celestial Kings that had objected had lost, and the Ancient Realm had still been split in two.

Though this was only Ling Han’s deduction, he felt that this was practically the truth.

But why was the Ancient Realm so important? It clearly could not possibly produce Severing Mundane Tiers. At most, one would be able to blast open the doors to the Celestial Realm when they had reached the Great Saint Tier.

Ling Han felt like he had touched the truth, yet even more mysteries were surrounding him, so he was unable to plug the holes in his deduction.

“The Young Imperial Empress has commanded me to secretly protect you all this while, so this is the first time I have appeared, for the sake of stopping you. However, your merging of the two Realms has already attracted the notice of the Celestial Realm. Next time, I may not be the first person to arrive here,” the woman continued. Though she disliked him, who asked this to be the command of the Young Imperial Empress?

The command of the Young Imperial Empress had to be completed fully.

“You definitely cannot merge the two Realms, or that would be merely courting your own death!” the woman said. There was one other matter that she did not say, and that was that if elites of the Celestial Realm wanted to deal with Ling Han, Hu Niu would lead the Roc Palace to snipe them down.

But in that way, it was equivalent to pushing the Roc Palace onto the opposing side of the various large sects of the Celestial Realm. Even such a powerful force like the Roc Palace could possibly be destroyed in a single night—Celestial King-level forces had been razed before, after all.

Hu Niu forbade her from saying so!

Ling Han nodded. He could guess that if there was someone from the Celestial Realm targeting him, Hu Niu would definitely stop them, and based on the information he had grasped, the Roc Palace still had powerful enemies eyeing them covetously. He would definitely not put Hu Niu into danger.

“I understand,” he answered in a low voice. Though merging the two Realms would bring him great benefits, he was more unwilling for Hu Niu to put her life on the line for his sake.

The woman gave Ling Han a profound look, and only then did her hands tug at the space in front of her, tearing a hole right in space. Her figure entered the rip and vanished.

This was an elite that was at least in the Severing Mundane Tier. As for what exact level she was at, Ling Han and the others could not guess at all. She was too powerful.

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks. None of them had imagined that there lay so much danger in the merging of the two Realms.

“The Celestial Realm actually forbids the merging of the two Realms!”

“I already had my suspicions previously. Clearly, the Celestial Realm’s Regulations are complete, and any Genesis Tier would be able to do the job, yet why has it never been put into action? I initially thought that it was because they were looking down on the Ancient Realm. I never thought that there was a strict command from a Celestial King that would not allow anyone to do such a thing.”

“Could it be that they are afraid of the Ancient Realm?”

This was inconceivable. Even if everyone had cultivated to the peak stage of the Saint King Tier in the Ancient Realm, so what? Perhaps only one Severing Mundane Ancestor would be enough to deal with all of them; it was only a matter of time.

It was unexplainable and completely illogical.

Ling Han nodded. “No matter how it is, the merging of the two Realms is impossible.”

“Let’s return to Wood Figure Planet first. Hopefully, those Saint Kings have not fled, so we can call them for an accounting!”

The three of them rode their respective golden paths, heading in the direction of Wood Figure Planet. Though Ling Han could increase his speed endlessly, that was to be used in battle. It was too much of a waste to use it for a journey, and he couldn’t maintain that kind of speed very long.

Around 10 days later, they had returned to Wood Figure Planet.

Suddenly, a great many Saints approached them. There was the Star Sand Saint and the other 10 Saints, as well as other Saint Kings that had stayed here. They had had no news of Ling Han for a good many years.

“Friend Ling, where have you gone all these years?” these Saint Kings asked.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and he involuntarily smirked internally. These people were really good at pretending. They were clearly the culprits that had ambushed him a few years ago, yet now they were playing dumb. Hoho, did they think that he would easily overlook the matter?

“The two Realms cannot be merged,” he said, and did not reveal the fact that this was a warning from the Celestial Realm so that these people would not question the matter closely. “There is only one other option left, and that is for me to blast open the doors to the Celestial Realm when I become a Great Saint, and bring some people with me to the Celestial Realm.”

A moment of commotion rose up among the Saint Kings. The two Realms actually could not be merged?

Though they were disappointed, the feeling was not too strong, because there was still another option of entering into the Celestial Realm with Ling Han. In any case, there were not many of them that had broad-minded and open nature to think of the interest of the whole world. It was already enough for them to be able to bring their own clans with them into the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han glanced at them, and said, “However, I am not duty-bound to help you guys for free. Those that want to enter into the Celestial Realm, come and buy your tickets. If I am satisfied, I will bring you with me into the Celestial Realm.”

When these words were spoken, a considerable number of Saint Kings were immediately angered.

Just what kind of noble status did they have?

Previously, they deigned to treat Ling Han as an equal, and that had been giving him a lot of face already. Yet now, he actually still wanted them to buy tickets?

They gave him an inch, and he became insufferably arrogant!
