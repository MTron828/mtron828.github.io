2739 Requesting Leave

Wally pondered for a moment before saying, “However, after considering the fact that you’ve already interacted with Void Particle Energy, due to the repulsion of this Void Particle Energy, the chance of success will further decrease by fourfold.”

Ling Han rolled his eyes in an exaggerated manner. Did this not imply a chance of less than one in 100 trillion?

This was infinitesimally close to zero!

Was this a completely impossible task?

!!

Ling Han fell deep in thought. His future was indeed bright, and as long as he progressed normally, he would eventually become the most powerful First Tier Heavenly Venerate. Only after advancing to the Second Tier would his advantage disappear.

For people to become a Heavenly Venerate, which of them wasn’t a supreme prodigy? Thus, if one attempted to defeat such a foe, that would be an extremely difficult task!

Now, Ling Han possessed three Heavenly Venerate Techniques, and he had more so been tempered by Void Particle Energy. Thus, his battle prowess was enough to crush all Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. In fact, he wouldn’t be at a disadvantage even against First Tier Heavenly Venerates.

However, such an advantage would only exist while he remained at the First Tier.

After advancing to the Second Tier, he would become just like everyone else. He would have to take things one step at a time.

“Can I master six different fundamental powers of the Genesis World first? And only master the unique power of the dimension after that?” Ling Han asked Wally.

If this were possible, he could extend his advantage all the way until he became a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

After advancing to the Seventh Tier, how many more opponents would he have? This number could definitely be counted on one hand, or perhaps two hands. Thus, what would it matter if their battle prowess became the same?

Wally shook his head, and replied, “After becoming a Heavenly Venerate, it’s very difficult to turn back around to comprehend the fundamental power of the world. Even if you comprehend only one more, it will still render it impossible for you to comprehend the unique and fundamental power of this dimension. The Sixth Tier will be your limit.”

‘Then that’s meaningless. To be invincible before the Seventh Tier, yet be unable to reach the Seventh Tier forever? Won’t I be screwed?’

If it were someone else, would the lure of reaching the Sixth Tier not be enticing and freakish enough? However, Ling Han’s goal had always been the Seventh Tier.

He wanted to become the strongest.

“In other words, if I want to become invincible, my only choice is to gamble with that one in 100 trillion chance?” Ling Han said with a frown.

“It’s a chance smaller than one in 100 trillion,” Wally corrected.

Ling Han looked Wally in the eyes. Could he not be so pedantic at such a moment?

“Alright!” Ling Han suddenly discovered a burst of confidence. Even though his chances were microscopic, he would still give it a shot!

Before this, possessing the unique power of a dimension was always a weakness. After all, just how powerful were he, Wu Haoyang, Lin Youlian, and Xin Qihu? They could easily crush other Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with a wave of their hands.

This was for no other reason than having experienced tempering from Void Particles or other fundamental powers of Genesis Worlds. After advancing to the First Tier, they could still maintain or even extend this advantage.

However, what if one could possess the power of two dimensions? Or even three? Or 10? Or 100?

At that time, would one still lose to those who had been tempered by Void Particle Energy?

If the quality was inferior, one could make up for it with quantity.

In some sense, this would be akin to advancing to the Eighth Tier, Ninth Tier, or Tenth Tier.

After discussing some finer details with Wally, Ling Han left the martial academy.

He had initially wanted to deal with some old animosities and drag out the Imperial Void Celestial King and his son to give them a healthy beating. However, he couldn’t find the two of them, and it appeared as if they had gone to the Realm Battlefield. However, Ling Han didn’t recall seeing them in the first level.

Perhaps the Imperial Void Celestial King had already become a Heavenly Venerate?

This wasn’t impossible. After all, the Imperial Void Celestial King was no less talented than the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. All he lacked was some rare opportunities, and it was because of this that he had been unable to take that vital step. Even while in the Celestial Realm, he had already been very close to advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

After arriving in this transcendent dimension, it would be extremely normal for him to advance in leaps and bounds.

So be it if he advanced. In Ling Han’s eyes, First Tier Heavenly Venerates were only so-so. He could easily rival them. Meanwhile, if he also became a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, his advantage provided by the Void Particle Energy would allow him to crush other First Tier Heavenly Venerates as if they were his playthings.

After several more decades spent on travel, Ling Han finally returned to the Realm Battlefield.

Ling Han discussed his plans with the Empress. After all, no one had ever succeeded on this path before. In fact, this was a path with no destination. Thus, he needed to discuss it with his wife.

Bewitching Maiden Rou and the others also joined this discussion, and the women all had their own opinions.

Some were of the opinion that Ling Han didn’t need to push himself so hard. Even if he slowed down and took things one step at a time, he would still eventually become the strongest Heavenly Venerate—one of the strongest. However, if he truly chose this path, he would very likely waste countless years of time.

Meanwhile, the Empress resolutely supported Ling Han. In fact, she desired to accompany him and also take this path to become the most powerful First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

After giving this some more thought, Ling Han ultimately decided to follow his heart. Otherwise, he would definitely have regrets. He would be left to ponder just how powerful he could have become if he had insisted on following this path.

After making a decision, Ling Han could no longer be swayed.

He went to the Celestial Administration to request leave. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Generally speaking, everyone who became a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would have to come here and volunteer their strength to resist Hysteria. This wasn’t the responsibility of so and so, but rather the responsibility of everyone.

Thus, Ling Han’s request for indefinite leave should have been impossible to approve.

However, because his contributions were far too dazzling—he had already charged into the general leaderboard, with his contributions being hundreds or even thousands of times greater than those of others—what harm would it do to grant him some leave?

Thus, the two Heavenly Venerates responsible for this area passed on Ling Han’s request for leave to the higher-ups.

The reply was swift—request denied!

This rejection was given by a higher-up in the fourth level. Apparently, this was a person with the surname He.

His words were as follows: “If one can enjoy special treatment in this place, then perhaps a person with great contributions can even flee in the face of battle?”

After hearing these words, Ling Han immediately guessed the identity of this person—this person was definitely He Yufeng’s father.

‘F*ck! How incredibly petty!’

Ling Han silently clenched his fists. However, without obtaining permission, he naturally couldn’t leave the Realm Battlefield for extended periods of time. After all, if everyone became so relaxed and uncaring, how could they still resist Hysteria?

Thus, in the Realm Battlefield, discipline reigned above all else. Everyone had to obey orders.

If Ling Han disregarded this rejection and chose to leave anyway, he would never need to return to this place. If he dared to return, he would definitely be captured and perhaps even executed on the spot.

He would be regarded as a deserter.

‘What should I do?’

Just as Ling Han was anxiously pondering over this, another order quickly arrived.

This was an order from another higher-up, and the person who came to deliver it was… Lin Piaoxue!

Whose order was this?

Lin Luo’s! A Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate!

His opinion was that Ling Han was a peerless prodigy who could potentially advance to the Seventh Tier in the future, which would allow him to change the tides of battle. Such a person should therefore be given more freedom, and not be weighed down by rigid rules and regulations.

Just like that, the two Heavenly Venerates in the Celestial Administration quickly approved Ling Han’s request for indefinite leave.

Just like Wu Zhihong’s words had reduced Wu Haoyang’s breaking of the rules to nothing more than causing a ruckus, Lin Luo’s words also possessed such power.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were the most powerful in this world.

“Thank you, Miss Lin,” Ling Han said to Lin Piaoxue as he clasped his hands. She had helped him immensely.

Lin Piaoxue smiled faintly, and said, “You’re the second person to cause my grandfather to speak and bend the rules.”

Ling Han’s interest was piqued, and he asked, “Who was the first?”

“My aunty,” Lin Piaoxue replied casually.

Lin Youlian, the princess of the Lin Clan. She was the most prodigious member of their clan, and she enjoyed an equal standing with Xin Qihu. She was regarded as someone who had the greatest chance to reach the Seventh Tier.

Ling Han nodded, saying, “I definitely won’t disappoint Lord Lin!
