Chapter 1406 Screwing over the Minister Again

“See, Wife, even he himself admits that you are the culprit!” Ling Han turned to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden again, all his killing intent evaporating into nothing.

This...

Deliberate misrepresentation, debauchery, and purposefully distorting the truth. What justice was there left in the world?

Everyone wore strange expressions. When had a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier fallen to this level that he did not even dare to point out the person who had injured him?

Ling Han was really too overbearing!

But even more women’s eyes shone brightly. This was a supremely good man, so considerate and protective that even they wanted to marry him.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden involuntarily laughed, and was also a bit embarrassed. She slapped Ling Han’s back lightly, but she was also filled with happiness. In the eyes of others, Ling Han was deliberately distorting the truth, overbearing and unreasonable, but in her eyes, this was the very gentlest and very most considerate action.

“Brother Sha, go ahead and get treatment for your injuries.” Ling Han shook his hand casually, and Sha Jing was instantly sent flying.

Though he had killed Sha Yuan, he did not bear a grudge against Sha Jing. As long as he did not act forceful and imperious, he was not the type to involve others in a personal grudge, either. Furthermore, Qu Qiuxue was already here, so no matter what, he still had to give her some face.

Sha Jing did not dare utter a word, and simply turned and left. At this instant, he was no Great General. He lowered his head, and even his figure seemed to be slightly smaller than usual.

Zhao Lun was almost scared out of his wits. Even the Great General Sha had been beaten like a dog, and he did not even dare utter a word of disagreement. Moreover, the Great Commander Qu also did not say a word, either, tacitly approving of Ling Han’s actions.

He did not want to die. He wanted to get his vengeance; he could he allow himself to die in this place!

“Zhao Lun, I have never minded competition, but you have repeatedly expressed killing intent towards me, and sent people to kill me. Furthermore, on the basis that your cultivation level had been higher than mine, you had also personally moved against me as well,” Ling Han said calmly. “Now, my cultivation level is higher than yours, so I shall also act the bully this once. If you can block three moves from me, I will spare your life.”

‘Three moves your sister!’

Zhao Lun was already cursing in his heart. Even his old man couldn’t block a single strike from Ling Han, and he actually wanted him to block three moves. How was this any means of giving him a way out?

“That’s right, I have absolutely no plans of allowing you to live!” Ling Han said. His hand tightened into a fist, and pa, Zhao Lun was kneaded into pieces. The blood and flesh of the Sun Moon Tier contained very strong power, but because it was confined by Ling Han’s hand, not the slightest bit of a shock wave was emitted.

Zhao Lun’s form and spirit had been destroyed.

Xiang Chengyun’s face had turned white, then turned green, and then became dark as if he was a chameleon. Now, every one of them had been called to an accounting by Ling Han, so how could he possibly be spared? Most importantly, all this had been started by him in the first place.

If only he had not wanted that damned private room in the first place!

Who could have imagined that the death of a Heavenly Body Tier elite would occur, and another had been forced to flee like a rat? And the starting fuse of all this was because two minor characters of the Mountain River Tier had forcibly wanted to snatch a private room?

It was possible that no one would believe this theory; it was too nonsensical.

“Lord Left Minister, save me! Save me!” Xiang Chengyun no longer cared that his leg had broken, and forcibly used Origin Power to solidify his bones. He scrambled to the Left Minister and knelt down with a loud bang, repeatedly kowtowing.

Though the Left Minister had witnessed the death of a Heavenly Body Tier elite, he did not know what part Xiang Chengyun had played in this matter. He was baffled. In his mind, how could a mere Mountain River Tier have the capability of offending a Heavenly Body Tier elite?

He waved him off, and said, “Get up first, what is going on here?”

This was his dog, after all. In front of outsiders, he still had the obligation to shield him a bit.

How could Xiang Chengyun possibly dare to get up? He merely continued to kowtow, and begged, “Milord, save me! Milord, save me!”

The Left Minister laughed, and thought that Xiang Chengyun had been scared dumb by the killing of a Heavenly Body Tier elite. He stretched out a hand and clapped Xiang Chengyun’s shoulder, and said, “Don’t be nervous. I am here, so there is no need for you to worry.”

Ling Han also smiled, and said, “The Left Minister is truly one to empathize with his subordinates.”

How could the Left Minister know that all this had been started by Xiang Chengyun? He did not dare believe that, either, and thought that Ling Han was really complimenting him. Involuntarily, the smile on his face grew wider.

If this had been the past, and Ling Han had dared say this to him, he not only would not have been pleased, he would have flown into a rage.

Just who did you think you were? You actually dared to praise me; did you think you were my superior?

But now, Ling Han had proved his superiority with his strength, and the Left Minister suddenly felt overwhelmed.

If the same words, even if it was a compliment, were spoken from the mouths of different people, the effects were absolutely different.

“Hoho, I should. It is my duty.” The Left Minister’s smile widened, and he appeared to be very pleased.

Ling Han also smiled, and then slowly said, “Brother Xiang is also astonishingly courageous. Previously, my brothers and I were dining in the restaurant, and Brother Xiang insisted that we should move so that we could allow him to have the private room. Then, afterwards, he even wanted my wife to share a drink with him.”

Pu!

The Left Minister immediately spluttered; even his face had turned green.

‘I ***** your sister!’

He looked at Xiang Chengyun, and Xiang Chengyun shivered as if he was ill. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

‘You are really quite bold!

‘You demanded that a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier let you have his private room, and asked another great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier to drink with you; just who do you think you are?

‘F***, I was already screwed over by Zhao Lun once just now, and now you also want to screw me over?

‘What enmity and animosity do you have against me!’

The Left Minister was furious, and suddenly started to thrash Xiang Chengyun heavily. What “empathizing with subordinates”? To hell with empathizing, he was about to kill himself because of him, and there was still talk of empathizing? Why didn’t no one empathize with him, then?

The speed at which he suddenly turned hostile was really unexpected.

Those nearby were all watching dumbfounded as the Left Minister, who was in humiliated rage, thrashed his own lackey with completely no care for his own image. It was practically enough to shatter their outlook on life.

“Is this really the Left Minister?”

“Spare me, milord! Spare me, milord!” Xiang Chengyun howled terribly. He had not thought that Ling Han had not even made a move, and it would be the Left Minister who would first take his life.

But the Left Minister had committed a grave error, so he naturally had to draw a clear distinguishing line between himself and Xiang Chengyun now. Otherwise, if Ling Han misunderstood that he was trying to cover up for Xiang Chengyun, it would be terrible.

Xiang Chengyun’s voice became softer and softer, and finally there was no longer any sign of life from him. He had been beaten to death.

He had died aggrieved.

His success was because of the Left Minister, and his death was also because of the Left Minister.

The reason why he could be a well-regarded and grand personage was because he had gained the backing of the Left Minister, but it was also because he had this backing that he was absolutely unrestrained and extremely ambitious. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone so far as to trifle with Ling Han. As a result, the Left Minister moved personally and beat him to death.

No matter how popular a lapdog was, he was still only a lapdog.

When everyone looked at Ling Han, their eyes were filled with respect. This kind of elite was already superior to the Right and Left Ministers and the Seven Generals. Just look at how even the Lord Left Minister was scared to this extent.

If the Nine Kings did not move, who would be capable of suppressing Ling Han?

Because the gap in their cultivation levels was too large, even when Ling Han had asked Lin You and the others to stay behind, and chatted with them for a while, all of them were incredibly reserved, and couldn’t even speak clearly. Ling Han did not compel them, either. After giving them some alchemical pills, he allowed them to leave.

Ling Han had the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the others first stay in an inn, whereas he himself would head to the Scarlet Heaven Academy.

With Ling Han’s current abilities, there was no one capable of stopping him from in this place. They weren’t qualified to discover his presence, and very soon, he arrived at the library.

Old Man Xu was just like how he had been, seated with his eyes closed in rest.
