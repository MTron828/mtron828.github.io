2871 Venturing deep underground

The competition now was extremely fierce. The veins of ore on ground level had already been more or less distributed, and the few remaining veins of ore were also being fought over by the various forces, which resulted in great conflicts.

This situation was destined to create rivers of blood, and even Heavenly Venerates could not be detached from it.

Hence, some forces had directed their attention beneath the ground. Perhaps there would be some places deeper underground that also possessed veins of ore.

However, if veins of ore were really discovered underground, the difficulty of excavating them would also be much higher because the further underground it was, the greater the pressure would be. There were also terrifying levels of heat that even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would frown at there.

!!

If that really was the case, then the only course of action was for Heavenly Venerates to step forth personally.

“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go,” Hu Niu urged.

The three of them were not the type to be afraid of trouble. Moreover, something like a vein of ore did not belong to anyone. It was definitely not a matter of first come, first served, but rather depended on strength.

The three of them continued onwards.

This passage was shockingly extensive, and when they reached a certain point, the heat here also reached a considerably high temperature.

It was not manifested from the Regulations of Fire. Firstly, that would not be able to affect Heavenly Venerates, and even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could easily withstand such heat, and secondly, the heaven and earth of this place had long since “died,” so how could there possibly still be any Regulations existing?

This heat was because the six fundamental powers of the Genesis World were endlessly clashing and conflicting, which created such high temperatures, and this kind of heat was definitely not something that could be withstood by power of Regulation. Hence, even a Ninth Heaven would find it difficult to endure this. Barging in forcefully would only result in them being burned into ash.

Ling Han and the others naturally were unafraid. Their strength was too great. Mere heat generated from the friction of fundamental particles was far from capable of making them feel wary.

However, after they delved deeper, it was not only the high heat that was scorching, there were also flames wafting here and there.

This was the display of even more intense clash and friction of fundamental particles, and even Ling Han and the others did not dare try to withstand the flames with their bodies. They would be throwing punches, delivering palm strikes, or using their Heavenly Venerate Tools to send these flames flying or snuffing them out.

“If it was a First Tier, they would only be able to dodge when they encounter this kind of flames,” Ling Han said.

A First Tier had only mastered the unique power of a specific dimension, but if they came here, they would actually not be much stronger than a Ninth Heaven, because this was a dead place. There was no unique power here or Regulations for them to extract at all.

When the power stored inside their body was completely exhausted, their battle prowess would decline drastically.

There were also unique stones as well as crystals here, but they did not have any value for cultivation. Ling Han examined them closely, and deduced that these were only the end products of being tempered by the fundamental powers.

The people ahead of them did not just have a small lead. Though Ling Han and the others were moving very quickly, they had still not managed to catch up with the people in front of them even after over a dozen days had passed, and it was unknown how far deep underground they had ventured.

This was a dead dimension, and could not possibly nurture any mysterious space. It only had so many layers, after all.

“At most, we should be able to reach the land’s heart in seven days,” Ling Han estimated.

In a real dimension, a core existed, and had great value, but would this dimension have a core?

“It should have long since been destroyed,” the Empress said. “After all, this dimension has long since died, and the core is the source of power for the whole dimension, just like the heart of a human being. It should have long since stopped functioning.”

“Perhaps there are still some remaining shards?” Hu Niu asked, clapping her hands. “Let’s quickly go and snatch it!”

Even a dead core of dimension would have great value, especially when this dimension had once been a transcendent dimension. Its value should be immeasurable.

Ling Han nodded. “Then let’s speed up.”

They increased their speed, and forged on at full speed.

Another five days passed, and they finally could sense some life ahead of them.

Aside from outsiders, it was impossible for there to be any local residents here.

They had caught up with them!

The three of them exchanged looks, and they immediately discovered that the people ahead of them had also stopped, and were no longer moving.

Clearly, the other side had also discovered their presence.

“Let’s meet them.”

Ling Han walked ahead, and after walking for another while, seven people appeared ahead of them, as expected.

The seven of them looked to be of varying age, having both men and women, but every single one of them was exuding the unique aura of an elite.

All of them were Heavenly Venerates, and the weakest was a First Tier, while the highest should be a Fourth Tier. After all, Ling Han was only a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, and being able to match a Fourth Tier did not mean that he could see through to the depths of a Fourth Tier.

“Scram!” The seven people on the other side had also spotted Ling Han and the others. When they discovered that the strongest among them was only a Third Tier, a youth in black robes immediately called out to them coldly.

It was just a Third Tier, and he actually gave them a scare.

“Little Hu, watch your words!” an elder in red robes reprimanded. He chuckled. “Please don’t take it to heart. This brat has just advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier not too long ago, so he is quite proud. It is inevitable that he would be a little condescending and arrogant.”

“It’s fine,” Ling Han said smilingly. He glanced at the youth in black robes, and mentally noted down that he was going to beat up this guy.

The elder in red robes continued, “We are close to the land’s heart by now. Why don’t we go together so we can watch out for one another?”

In the eyes of others, this was a very good thing. An elite that was at least Fourth Tier was earnestly inviting them to go with them; wouldn’t that mean that they now had a protective talisman?

Ling Han also smiled. “Though this is a dead dimension, it has once been a transcendent dimension, after all. It is possible that the core of the dimension will still have tremendous might, and will be extremely dangerous.”

“Precisely. Hence, it is even more necessary for the three of you to cooperate with me.” The elder in red robes laughed loudly.

Ling Han shook his head. “How would I know that Senior truly wants to protect us… or is using us as scouts to test the dangers that lie ahead?”

The elder in red robes faltered, and then laughed loudly. “Brat, you are very clever.”

“Thank you for the praise, Senior.” Ling Han appeared very modest.

“However, you have become a victim of your own cleverness.” The expression of the elder in red robes became sinister. “Since you have already predicted that, I can’t be bothered to waste any more words, either. Just scout out the way in front of us obediently.”

“And if I refuse?” Ling Han asked.

“Then your only path is death!” These words were not spoken by the elder in red robes, but rather by a woman in purple robes. She was very beautiful, but compared to the Empress and Hu Niu, her beauty was far too inferior.

“In the world of today, the deaths of a few Heavenly Venerates would not be worth much at all,” a sturdy man of broad build commented calmly, as if he was offering a reminder, which was also a threat at the same time.

Ling Han laughed. “Aren’t you guys afraid that I have a father who’s a Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier?”

“Do you?” the woman in purple robes demanded disdainfully, her expression extremely harsh and unkind.

Ling Han shook his head. “No. But my grandfather…”

...

“What about your grandfather?” the sturdy man asked, his expression slightly serious. If Ling Han really had a grandfather who was a Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier, then they would have to treat him seriously. Even if they wanted to kill him, they had to make sure that it was done secretly and soundlessly; not the slightest bit of news could be allowed to leak out at all.

“Hehe, his grandfather is not a Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier, either, but has rather died long ago.” Hu Niu giggled.

‘F*ck, are you guys playing around with us?’

Without waiting for the seven of them to react, the Empress’s mischievous nature was completely stoked as well, and she began, “But our master…”

‘What about your master?’ Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“He is a Third Tier,” Ling Han said smilingly.

The seven people on the other side exchanged looks, and were all outraged. ‘You guys are really too arrogant, aren’t you? Even now, you people still dare to make empty boasts and tease us?’

“You’re going to regret refusing us!” The sturdy man stepped out. He was a Third Tier, and he was certain he alone would be able to suppress Ling Han and the others.

“Let me.” The Empress took a step forward.

“Let Niu deal with it!” Hu Niu hurriedly stepped forward as well. She wanted to compete with the Empress all the time.
