Chapter 2126: Arrangements

This was a spatial restraint.

Before the Celestial King Tier, the Regulations of Space were superior to the Five Elements, and most people cultivated the Five Elements. Thus, anyone who cultivated the Regulations of Space would be superior to others by nature.

Yulan Fenghua showed a hint of arrogance. This was the secret technique unique to the Imperial Void Celestial King. Among the Imperial Void Celestial King’s nine disciples, he was the only one who had grasped this secret technique.

Beneath the Heavenly Pillar, Ling Han’s limbs would be restrained, as if he was suppressed by the pillar of heaven.

Boom, he sent out a palm strike directly at Ling Han’s chest.

If this blow landed, Ling Han would definitely sustain serious injury. However, Yulan Fengua had deliberately avoided his mind, which could be considered as having fulfilled his previous promise—as long as Ling Han could survive 100 moves from him, he would spare Ling Han’s life.

Ling Han smiled faintly.?Weng, the space around him warped, as if countless mirrors had come to being. Ling Han’s image could be seen everywhere.

‘You can use Regulations of Space, and you think I can’t?’

Yulan Fenghua immediately came to an abrupt stop. That was because he could not distinguish which was the real Ling Han at all.

All of them exuded an aura that made it seem like they were the real one, but how could so many true selves exist, so they had to be false. Then, where was the real one?

“Great Spatial Cut!” He was only taken aback for a moment, and then immediately used another celestial technique. The Pseudo-Celestial Tool in his hold glowed, and sent out a streak of light that was 30,000 meters long, slashing out at his surroundings.

Instantly, the space was shattered. Those images of Ling Han also shattered into pieces. Finally, Ling Han’s true self appeared. He was standing in the air 300 meters away, and his two divided souls stood beside him.

Yulan Fenghua stood, sword in hand. “You are indeed very strong, but definitely no match for me.”

“Where does your confidence come from?” Ling Han asked smilingly. He had not used Great Clash of Source Powers. He was sure that if he used this move, even if Yulan Fenghua did not die, he would definitely not dare to take a second attack from him.

“That is because I really am that strong!” Yulan Fenghua declared proudly, pressing out his left hand at Ling Han.?Qiang, multiple divine chains of Regulations shot out, turning into a web that sealed off all paths of retreat for Ling Han.

Ling Han also pressed out his left hand, the Regulation of Slaughter activating. Sword Qi danced wildly, slashing the divine chains of Regulations that Yulan Fenghua had shot out into bits. He launched an offensive, and the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords was used, its vicious might soaring sky-high.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Weng! Weng! Weng!

The two great prodigies clashed, and one celestial technique after another was cast. The explosive tension became heavier and heavier, and the might of their secret techniques also became stronger and stronger.

All prodigies were proud, especially for overlords of monarch tiers like them. If their cultivation levels were close, then they would definitely want to win, and Yulan Fenghua’s pressure was clearly heavier because he had the advantage of a minor level over Ling Han.

Even if Ling Han forced him to a tie, he could not accept it, either. Otherwise, how could he bring himself to face others in future?

Unleashing a battle cry, his whole person became ethereal. One after another, spatial spikes shot out from his body. Each one was the overwhelming blow of the pinnacle of Heaven Soul, and it was guaranteed that even a Heaven Soul monarch tier would be incredibly troubled by this.

Ling Han had no wish to easily expose the secret of the toughness of his physique. Thus, he also used Regulations of Space, and manifested thousands of himself. No matter how strong your attack was, so what? If it could not hit me, it was completely useless.

The two prodigies were continuously and endlessly battling intensely like that. Sometimes, it would be Ling Han beating down on Yulan Fenghua, while at other times, it was Yulan Fenghua instead that was suppressing Ling Han. Offensive and defensive switched from one side to the other at a shocking speed, and neither of them could truly claim the upper hand. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hahahaha!” Yulan Fenghua suddenly laughed loudly. He took the initiative to stop, and said, “Your strength is close to mine, and it would be meaningless for us to continue fighting. Why don’t we call a ceasefire now?”

“Sure!” Ling Han nodded.

All that he had done was merely to make his way into the Imperial Void Sect, so he naturally wouldn’t really battle Yulan Fenghua to the death.

…If he was really serious, he would have used the Great Clash of Source Powers. The destructive power of that was enough to destroy the heavens and earth, and was even capable of blasting a hole through the void.

“Come, come, come, Brother Han, let us have a nice chat.” Yulan Fenghua pulled on Ling Han’s hand, presenting an image of good friends and brothers.

All the members of the Liu Clan exchanged looks. They were done just like that?

Hadn’t he said that he would kill Ling Han?

And now, the Liu Clan was already razed to the ground, with many of their members dead. Whom were they going to seek justice from?

But Yulan Fenghua was the Holy Son of the Imperial Void Sect, while they were only the descendants of a courtesan. How could they compare? Furthermore, the gap in power was practically the difference between heaven and earth, so they had best just keep quiet. Who knew, they might even anger Yulan Fenghua into eliminating them.

Yulan Fenghua was smiling very brightly on the surface, but killing intent was already shifting quietly in his heart.

He could do nothing against Ling Han, but he was also sure that Ling Han could not do anything to him. However, Ling Han was inferior to him by a minor level. Thus, in a battle of equal cultivation levels, he was definitely no match for Ling Han.

Which also meant that the latter was even more freakishly genius than himself.

He definitely could not allow this kind of prodigy to exist in his eyes, and he was determined to eliminate him.

Thus, he had to appease Ling Han first, and then set up some arrangements to get rid of Ling Han.

Someone that was even more freakish than himself could not be allowed to exist in this world—at least not someone without any kind of background like Ling Han.

He had already left the Liu Clan town with Ling Han—though it had already been razed to the ground. Then, they found a restaurant, sat facing each other, and began to talk.

Yulan Fenghua was trying to worm info out of Ling Han, and Ling Han was attempting the same thing. Yulan Fenghua wanted to know of Ling Han’s origins. If this guy was connected to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King or even Heavenly Venerable Tier, then even he would not dare to act recklessly.

And Ling Han wanted to know more about the Imperial Void Sect, so there was naturally no simpler, more direct means than asking the Holy Son of the Imperial Void Sect.

Additionally, Ling Han also wanted to know which Heavenly Realm he was in. If he were to ask directly, others would probably laugh themselves to death.

…You didn’t even know where you yourself were?

After talking for a long time, the two of them finally gained some information that they each needed.

Yulan Fenghua had confirmed that Ling Han did not come from any kind of powerful background, but was truly very talented and had extremely good luck, while Ling Han also found out some facts about the Imperial Void Sect. At least, he found out which Heavenly Realm he was currently in.

Ten Thousand Splendors Heaven, which lay adjacent to the Roc Heaven.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, he had not been diverted too far away.

“Brother Ling, are you interested in paying a visit to the Imperial Void Sect?” Yulan Fenghua offered an invitation to Ling Han. “With your natural talent, Brother Ling, my master may also appreciate you, and might even take you in as a disciple.”

‘Here it comes!’

Ling Han was not willing to believe that the other man would really be so kind. Instead, he only wished to deceive him into entering the Imperial Void Sect. By then, with Yulan Fenghua’s status, it would be extremely easy for him to kill him secretly with a trap.

However, this fell in line with Ling Han’s own plans. He wanted to enter into the Imperial Void Sect, and finally enter into the Sealed Emotion Palace with that as his stepping stone.

However, it was not now.

“I still have some private matters to settle, so maybe a while later,” Ling Han replied. He wanted to go to the Roc Palace first. That could no longer wait.

“When?” Yulan Fenghua asked, unwilling to resign.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “We’ll set the time at 100 years from now, then.”

“All right, then I will wait for Brother Ling’s arrival at the Imperial Void Sect!” Yulan Fenghua was not the type to worry about his gains and losses. Immediately, he clapped his hands. To Celestials, 100 years’ time would pass practically with a snap of the fingers.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I will take my leave.”

“Please.” Yulan Fenghua stood up to send him off.

Ling Han had already achieved his goal for this trip, so he naturally would not loiter around much longer. His only purpose for deliberately taking this detour was the Imperial Void Sect.

“You have to consider seriously,” Small Tower spoke up suddenly.
