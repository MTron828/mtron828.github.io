Chapter 1827: A different kind of great battle

Ling Han was very speechless. The two great elites seemed utterly determined to tear his clothes apart so that he would be naked.

Most importantly, this did not have the slightest significance, yet Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng still looked like they would win as long as they had torn his clothes off him, which Ling Han did not know whether to laugh or cry at.

And the problem was Ling Han did not have the slightest desire to be bare and naked!

To say nothing of the fact that his wife and Bewitching Maiden Rou were still here, even if they weren’t here, he had no interest to expose himself completely to the two of them.

If they were so intent on tearing clothes, they should just tear off their own!

Ling Han was furious. Come on then, wasn’t it just tearing off clothes? Did they think he didn’t know how to go about doing it?

He also used his techniques, and made a move on Zihe Bingyun’s and Luo Changfeng’s clothes. He would really like to see who would be bared first.

The three king among kings fought fiercely. This scene was naturally incredibly grand, yet Bewitching Maiden Rou was watching in shock, wearing a very strange expression on her face.

‘You guys... are you really emperor tiers?

‘There is no other emperor tier like you people!’

Making a move on each other’s clothes, they were just like old housewives or hoodlums on the streets, tearing and pulling at each other. There was really no taste to it.

‘Is it really all right for you to act like that?’

Now that the great battle to tear off clothes had been launched, even Ling Han was unable to escape.

His physique was indeed very strong, and he was unafraid of the attacks from two great kings among kings, but his clothes weren’t. In the face of having two great emperor tiers so determined to attack even if it meant that they would be injured, how could they not be damaged quickly?

Even if the clothes that he was wearing were woven using top-grade Saintly Material, which had also been fused with the celestial wings of certain Immortal Beasts, how could they manage to hold up to the desperate attacks of Celestial King Tier techniques of two third severance emperor tiers?

However, though the clothes on Ling Han had turned into pieces, Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng were not all that much better off, either. The clothes they were wearing were also ripped. They practically looked like beggars.

This caused Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng to feel fear. That was because they knew that they were not able to resist the Fire Element of heaven and earth here, and once the Blood Dragon Armor had been torn open, they would definitely be dead.

But this also firmed their resolve. That was because since Ling Han had counterattacked so fiercely, it had to mean that he had been scared.

‘Then let’s just see who will be the first to fall.

‘I’ll rip!’

The two great emperor tiers gritted their teeth, and continued to rip like mad.

‘You rip? Don’t I know how to rip as well?’

Ling Han was enraged. He had no intention of exposing his behind in public.

Boom, the Nine Heavens Flame turned into swords under the Flame Control Technique, and slashed madly at the two great emperor tiers. Even if Zihe Bingyun’s and Luo Changfeng’s strength was extremely powerful, they would not be able to protect themselves entirely. This was a true Celestial King technique, and added with it being a Source Power of heaven and earth, it was exceedingly powerful.

“Use your ultimate technique!” Zihe Bingyun forced out through gritted teeth. If this continued, it was possible that they would be bared first instead of Ling Han.

This naturally could not be allowed.

Luo Changfeng gritted his teeth, and then suddenly delivered a palm strike onto his chest. Suddenly, blood spurted from his mouth. However, he stretched out a finger and drew a circle, and the blood floated as if it had turned into swimming fish.

This blood flickered with light, then rapidly evaporated, and was absorbed by the arm guards. Then, the originally golden arm guards became even brighter. Multiple flashes of light spread out, turning into an incredibly complex symbol.

Luo Changfeng’s whole person had become considerably weaker. Limited by his cultivation level, these arm guards could release Severing Mundane Tier-level battle prowess at most, but now he had sacrificed a mouthful of blood essence, yet had increased the might of the arm guards further to a new level.

On the other side, Zihe Bingyun’s expression was also grim. Multiple symbols lit up on her body, and a half-transparent precious sword emerged from her chest.

This was the might of her Ethereal Divine Fetus!

Under her stimulation in which she spared no expense, a great amount of gray hair appeared at her hairline. Her life force had been greatly expended, but she had ultimately summoned the Ethereal Divine Sword.

What was a Divine Fetus?

That was one that possessed some Celestial King Tier technique, but because their cultivation level was not there yet, they would have to pay an extremely high price if they wanted to use this technique.

But now, it was either you that would become naked or me, and the two great emperor tiers naturally would not have the slightest bit of hesitation left.

‘You had best be the one to become naked!’

“Go!”

Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng simultaneously released their strongest attack, which blasted towards Ling Han.

Peng!

As the attacks surged past, the brilliant light instantly concealed Ling Han completely. After flashing blindingly for at least a breath’s time, it finally dimmed.

This could possibly be the most unusual battle in history. Three great emperor tiers were giving their all just to make their opponent naked. If this was made public, it was possible that no one would believe it. The greater possibility would that everyone would be laughing their heads off.

Ling Han appeared, exposing his fair, naked body, as well as blood stains. Thankfully, because of these blood stains, Ling Han managed to save his modesty.

After all, that was the might released from a Celestial King Tier Tool and a Divine Fetus, and even one with Ling Han’s physique had still been wounded.

Both Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng were dumbfounded. Of course, they were not stunned by the majestic size of a certain part of Ling Han’s body, but rather that this guy had just suffered a slight injury, and then that was that.

This was a fatal area!

‘Where did you wear your Blood Dragon Armor?’

The two of them searched earnestly, but they could not find the presence of the Blood Dragon Armor at all.

It could be worn inside one’s clothes, but it was impossible that it was still invisible when one was completely bare. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

‘You, you are definitely not human!’

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou wanted very much to cover her face. Though it was Ling Han’s behind that was turned towards her, for elites like them, their divine sense could completely be used like eyes. Wherever their divine sense had swept, they naturally would be able to “see” very clearly.

Though she was the Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect, and her strength was in charm techniques, she had never had any intimate contact with any man before, what more seeing a man completely bare and naked as the day he was born.

Ling Han took out some clothes, but did not have the time to put them on. He directly tied them at his waist. It was enough for them to temporarily conceal him. He glared at Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng, enraged to the extreme. They actually dared to force him to run naked?

“Die!”

Ling Han pounced out, and launched an offensive against Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng.

This time, Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng were really incapable of holding up to it. They had already used a powerful move, and now was precisely their weakest time. How could they hold up to this furious counterattack from Ling Han?

Furthermore, Ling Han was similarly just targeting their clothes, and that was definitely even harder to defend than their bodies.

Pieces of fabric flew everywhere, and Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng very soon followed in Ling Han’s footsteps, becoming completely bare and naked.

Luo Changfeng was still better off. After all, he was a man, yet Zihe Bingyun felt like she was about to die of shame. Right in front of four people—and two of them were men at that—multiple holes were torn in her clothes, and her body was completely exposed to the extreme.

However, this was far from the only thing she had to worry about.

She had worn the Blood Dragon Armor inside her clothes. That was because she wanted to look beautiful, and wearing the Blood Dragon Armor outside her clothes would affect aesthetic senses, but whether it was used as outer armor or inner armor, this armor was now covered with holes, and its protective effects had already vanished.

She could clearly feel a murderous aura hovering around her, restless around where the holes were, but because the Blood Dragon Armor still had some effect, she was able to withstand it for the moment, yet her time was definitely limited.

Retreat!

Without the slightest hesitation, Zihe Bingyun immediately turned around to flee.

If she had lost even her life, then what was the point of the Heavenly Dao Jade? Even if she wanted revenge, she would still have to be alive to do that.

She was very self-centered, completely unconcerned with Luo Changfeng’s survival. She was very decisive and determined when she turned to flee, as if it had not been the two of them who had just fought together on the same side.

“Humph!” How could Ling Han possibly allow her to do as she pleased? Even if he didn’t kill Luo Changfeng this time round, he was determined to kill Zihe Bingyun. Without ridding the world of this cruel and vicious demoness, his heart would never be at peace again.
