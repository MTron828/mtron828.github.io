Chapter 3412: Torture

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Yuwen Hou added another Transformation Fruit to the stakes.

Thankfully, he was a prodigy of the Demon Race. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to possess a Transformation Fruit while he himself had already taken human form.

Though he was very furious, upon further thought, he would definitely win anyways, so what need was there for him to be concerned?

Yuwen Hou didn’t care what stakes Ling Han placed. In any case, his goal was to pummel Ling Han. It would be best if he could cripple this human.

“Are you done now?” he asked darkly.

Ling Han bared his teeth in a grin, and crooked a finger, “Come on then.”

Yuwen Hou walked towards Ling Han in large strides. Boom, he released his full aura. From Blood Transformation to Extreme Bone and all the way to the Inscription Tier, he had already experienced three massive leaps in level of being, and in essence, far surpassed Ling Han.

This was especially the case for Inscription Tier elites. They inscribed the Dao Patterns of heaven and earth on their internal organs, allowing them to absorb and stimulate the power of heaven and earth. Their battle prowess soared to a terrifying level.

He stimulated his battle prowess to his heart’s content. Once he made a move he would defeat Ling Han like a thunderbolt, not giving the latter the slightest bit of chance.

“You’re just a human,” he said disdainfully.

These words caused everyone’s expressions to change drastically, revealing anger. You, a subject of a surrendered nation, still dare to speak conceited nonsense?

However, if they were being honest, aside from Hong Tianbu, who else in the Inscription Tier could rival him?

The Demon Race was indeed stronger before reaching the Celestial Path. This was something that had to be admitted.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Just because of these words from you, I will definitely beat you to tears.”

“In your dreams!” Yuwen Hou walked closer and closer. His body was clearly slender but not sturdy, yet it was as if there was a great dragon hidden inside his body, exuding an incredibly vigorous aura.

“Now, it’s time to wake up from your dream.” He flew over and threw a punch at Ling Han.

With a thought from Ling Han, Absolute Fairness was immediately activated. Weng! A paramount power surged into the surroundings. Within 30 meters, it was absolute fairness.

What?!” Yuwen Hou couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. This was because he discovered that his cultivation level had actually plummeted, falling to the sixth level of the Extreme Bone Tier.

That’s right. He had also broken through his limits in Extreme Bone Tier. Otherwise, how could he have been freakish enough to challenge Hong Tianbu? He immediately calmed down. So what if he was at the sixth level of Extreme Bone Tier? He still had an extremely great advantage. In terms of level of being, he far surpassed Ling Han.

He roared loudly, and did not stop his advance. He still threw out a punch.

“What’s going on?”

“Why has Yuwen Hou’s aura suddenly declined greatly?”

Everyone was curious, and elites like the Third Imperial Prince immediately narrowed their eyes. They were more knowledgeable, and Princess Bixiao’s beautiful eyes narrowed. She had already guessed the reason.

“Piss off!” Ling Han roared. He also clenched his fist and charged at Yuwen Hou.

The two powers crashed into one another, instantly triggering a fierce collision. The power of Yuwen Hou’s punch immediately crumbled, and Ling Han pushed the power of his fist over aggressively. With a peng, Yuwen Hou was immediately sent flying.

Ling Han immediately set off in pursuit. Absolute Fairness had restrictions on the area that it enshrouded. He couldn’t allow Yuwen Hou to leave him farther than 30 meters, or the latter’s cultivation would recover.

Xiu, at three times the speed of sound, Ling Han had already caught up to Yuwen Hou and threw another punch.

Yuwen Hou parried, but with the Demonic Monkey Fists’ fifty layers of power stacked together, how could he block it?

Peng! He was sent flying again.

Ling Han chased after him, his fists punching out endlessly.

Peng, peng, peng! Instantly, Yuwen Hou was only left with the option of being pummeled.

In a battle of equal cultivation levels, Ling Han’s invincibility did not require any conditions.

So what if it was Yuwen Hou? So what if his cultivation level was higher by five minor levels?

This was only a one-sided torture.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Who could have imagined this?

Could it be that it could be that Ling Han was already heaven-defyingly strong and could be invincible even with a gap of two major tiers in cultivation level? ’ “Look at the radiance on his body,” someone said slowly, revealing the truth “That’s the treasured armor. There’s a formation laid out on it, forcefully pulling Yuwen Hou’s cultivation level to the Extreme Bone Tier.”

In other words, this is a fair battle between those at Extreme Bone Tier.” “No, Yuwen Hou actually still has an advantage. Right now, he’s definitely not a First Extreme, but rather a Fifth Extreme.”

“Even so, he is still no match?”

This… still means that Ling Han is heaven-defyingly powerful!”

Everyone exchanged looks, rendered speechless.

Yuwen Hou wanted to challenge Hong Tianbu. The two of them were both Inscription Tier elites, so it was clear just how confident Yuwen Hou was.

But now?

Ling Han and Yuwen Hou were both Extreme Bone Tier elites. Moreover, Yuwen Hou had the advantage of a few minor levels of cultivation level, yet was completely no match for Ling Han. What kind of prodigy was this? ’ No one knew that Ling Han had broken through to the Seventh Change. In fact, he had even triggered the phenomenon of heaven and earth.

Even the heaven and earth had been alerted, which showed how terrifying this step was.

This allowed Ling Han to possess absolute confidence. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, without any prerequisites, he was definitely invincible.

The reality was certainly so.

Ling Han gave chase. As he swung his fists, a terrifying power surged. So what if it was Yuwen Hou? He could only suffer a beating.

Ten minutes was enough for him to beat this opponent into smithereens.

In truth, it was only five minutes, at most, before Princess Bixiao called a halt to the battle, admitting defeat on behalf of Yuwen Hou.

It was really unbearable to watch. This was completely a one-sided torture.

Ling Han cracked a smile, swept his gaze over the members of the Demon Race, and asked calmly, “Who else would like to challenge me?”

At this moment, he was brimming with the aura of someone who had easily defeated Yuwen Houhu. It was as if he were a demonic god, and his aura was so heavy that everyone felt suffocated. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Hehe.” Ling Han picked up the bamboo and Transformation Fruit on the stone table and left.

No one knew that 10 minutes was almost up. If another elite challenged Ling Han, Absolute Fairness Fairness would be useless.

However, though Ling Han had left, this heavy bomb that he had dropped still caused a stir among the masses.

“This person can actually pull the cultivation level of others to the same level as him.”

“His battle prowess at the same cultivation level is unmatched, so who can match him?”

“Doesn’t that mean he is invincible?”

“How could there be such a formation? Wouldn’t that cause the hard cultivation of others to come to nothing?”

You have worked so hard to cultivate to an absolute high cultivation level, but a formation technique from him was enough to send you to the bottom of the valley. Who could accept that?

Princess Bixiao pondered for a moment, then said, “This isAbsoiute Fairness, a simplified version of the Formation that suppresses cultivation level. Originally, it was a large-scale Formation that was used by ancient sects to select outstanding disciples, but a prodigious Formation Master simplified it It can be adhered to clothing, affecting those in the vicinity.”

“However, the area of effect is limited, and the time it can take effect is also limited. It should be less than half an hour.”

Though her words were not completely accurate, it could already be considered knowledgeable.

As expected of Princess Bixiao. She is really too knowledgeable.”

“So, this boy’s formation can only last for a limited amount of time. No wonder he left without saying anything. That’s because if anyone else challenges him, the formation won’t be able to show its might.”

“F***, I was actually scared off by this guy!”

All the Demon Race were filled with endless regret..
