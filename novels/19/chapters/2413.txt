Chapter 2414: Mist-locked Valley

A Celestial Tree could bear several fruits, and every single fruit was actually a complete Celestial Seed!

Ling Han needed a very large number of Celestial Seeds, and when he heard wind of this information, he was naturally tempted.

Though there were very few complete Celestial Seeds, there would still be people who managed to obtain them as well, and a lot of information had streamed out. For example, the closer to the heart of the Celestial Path, the closer to perfection the Celestial Seed fruits borne by the Celestial Trees there would be, and the stronger the Celestial Kings that had obtained these fruits.

If he could obtain complete Celestial Seeds here, Ling Han had no plans on refining it himself, but he would keep one in reserve just in case. If he had still not managed to find a better Celestial Seed when it was close to the deadline of 10,000 years, he would use this Celestial Seed to complete his breakthrough. It was still better than using a Celestial Seed that was pieced together from different shards of Celestial Seed.

Very quickly, they set out on their way. The fruits of this Celestial Tree were close to ripening. Perhaps, it would be another three years, or 10 years, but in any case, the time would definitely not be too long.

Just half a day later, they arrived at their destination, a valley that was enshrouded in mist. One would be immediately dazed when he entered, completely incapable of distinguishing any sense of direction. They would then walk back out of the valley in a complete daze.

Once, twice, thrice, no matter how many times, it would produce the same result. It was like they would be endlessly lost.

“Formation?” Ling Han and the others were all curious.

They tried to unravel it, but this fog was formed naturally, and there was no rhyme or reason to it. They had no idea where to get started.

After a few times, they still walked back out of the valley.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel rueful. If Wally was here, it would be great. With the analysis ability of this non-human, he might be able to unravel the mist of this valley.

“There is no need for you to waste energy.” A voice slowly rang out, bearing a powerful magnetism.

A young man walked over, dressed in tight-fitting white robes. He looked very handsome, a laid-back expression on his face.

Ling Han looked over. “Why do you say that?”

“The mist in this valley would only disperse at midnight every night. It will last for two hours, and only at that time will anyone be able to enter. Otherwise, no matter how strong, or how high your cultivation level is, you will only be running around in circles even if you enter, and just come right out in a daze,” the young man in tight-fitting robes explained.

“Thanks for the tip.” Ling Han clasped his fists. There was night and day on the Celestial Path, but day would last 72 hours, and night would also last 72 hours. A single day was shockingly long.

“Outsider?” The young man in tight-fitting robes raised a brow.

Ling Han smiled. “How can you tell?”

The young man laughed. “Aside from outsiders, who else would dare come here?”

What did this mean?

Was it because this place was too dangerous, so no locals would dare to come, or was it that this had been partitioned as forbidden land by some force, forbidding any interference from outsiders?

“I am Ling Han. How should I address you?” Ling Han asked. Just because the other party had chosen to give them a hint, he also chose to adopt diplomatic measures before violence.

“Shen Hao,” the young man answered. “Outsider, this is not a place that you should be in. Trust me.”

Ling Han gave an “oh,” and asked, “This place is extremely dangerous?”

“You can say that.” Shen Hao thought for a moment, and then nodded. “But the source of this danger is primarily humans.”

Ling Han understood now. The environment here was indeed dangerous, but it should have been occupied by a particular force, and that was why the man said that the main source of danger was humans.

“What I enjoy most is battle, and the stronger the opponent, the better,” Ling Han said.

Shen Hao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then said, “Outsider, you have very strong confidence! However, your knowledge of our area is too limited. You will be disadvantaged!”

Ling Han was unconcerned, and took out a handful of Crimson Demonic Earth. With a grin, he asked, “Are you talking about this?”

Shen Hao was surprised. He was indeed planning to say that if outsiders did not know about the Crimson Demonic Earth, they would lose horribly against an opponent of the same level, or even one weaker by a single level. He had not expected that this outsider had already found out about the effects of the Crimson Demonic Earth when the Celestial Path had just opened. In fact, he even had a considerable amount of it in possession.

“I had not expected that you would actually discover the secret of the Crimson Demonic Earth.” He paused, and then continued, “Looks like you have Celestial King Tier elders in your clan, right?”

Celestial Kings would definitely have walked the Celestial Path before. Thus, if Ling Han had a Celestial King behind him, it was nothing strange for him to know about the Crimson Demonic Earth. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled slightly, and did not refute that. Did having or not having a Celestial King Tier background have any importance here? In any case, the hand of the Celestial King could not possibly interfere here. He continued the previous conversation topic. “If we don’t leave, could it be that you are planning to use violence against us?”

Once more, Shen Hao showed a laid-back expression. “I can’t be bothered to. However, I am the lazy type, but the others would not do the same.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “You are quite interesting.”

Yet Shen Hao shook his head. “Outsider, don’t think that you are very strong. Let me give you a piece of advice. On the Celestial Path, our strength is usually greater than yours.”

This clearly was Shen Hao looking at the sky from the bottom of a well.

Though the majority of Ascending Origin Tiers were indeed very ordinary, king tiers were already very rare, after all. Naturally, emperor tiers and monarch tiers were even rarer to come by. Monarch Stars were definitely few and far between. Hence, it was very easy for the residents of the Celestial Path to consider all outsiders as ordinary Ascending Origin Tiers.

“If anyone doesn’t like it, Niu will beat him into submission!” Hu Niu brandished her tiny fist in a wave, looking very fierce.

She was exquisitely beautiful, and also held the air of naivete that belonged to a young girl. This action did not seem to be the slightest bit destructive, and others would only think that she was cute and innocent.

Shen Hao couldn’t help but be dazed for a moment, and he only came back to himself with a tremble a moment later. He shrugged carelessly. “In any case, I have already warned you. Whether you heed my warning or not is your own business.” He yawned, and looked like he simply wanted to find some place to lie down and have a good nap.

“Second Senior Brother, whom are you talking to?” A person flew down from the cliff in the distance. It was a woman who was very beautiful. Her tight-fitting red suit outlined her shapely figure. Her eyes swept over, and when she discovered the presence of Hu Niu and the other women, her eyes involuntarily narrowed.

Too beautiful!

One was noble, one was innocent, and the last was seductive. Even she felt her heart throb faster upon seeing them.

She couldn’t help but feel a sliver of killing intent. There was actually someone that was superior to her in looks, and it was not just one, but as many as three of them at that!

Shen Hao’s brow raised slightly, not bothering to answer.

“Outsiders?” The red-clothed woman swept down a glance again, a sliver of a smile curling up the corners of her lips, but her smile carried cruelty.

It was easily resolved since they were just outsiders then. If she killed them, that would be completely fine. There was no need to worry about leaving behind any trouble.

“Actually daring to barge into here, you all are seeking your own deaths!” the red-clothed woman declared coldly. With a shake of her hands, a winding blade appeared in each of her hands. Each winding blade was branded with nine seals, and they were already glowing.

She had activated her precious tool. From the get-go, she was going to have no mercy, planning to kill Ling Han and the others.

Firstly, it was forbidden for outsiders to interfere in this place, and secondly, she was jealous of Hu Niu and the other women, and had thus immediately “lit up her blades.”

“Ugly people are always doing deeds that are up to no good!” The Empress sneered. With a few graceful steps and slight swaying of her slender waist, she was both seductively beautiful and elegantly noble. One’s heart would tremble, yet at the same time, it would not dare to disrespect her. This was a goddess that could only be admired from afar.

Even the red-robed woman’s bearing was weaker. In fact, her back had involuntarily bent slightly, but she immediately came back to her senses. She was abruptly infuriated and embarrassed. With a soft exclamation, she charged towards the Empress.

Peng!

With a flash of red, she was sent flying at a speed faster than when she had shot forwards.
