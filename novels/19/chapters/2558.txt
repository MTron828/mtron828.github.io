Chapter 2559: Ghost King City

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Li Long and Zhao Ting had indeed been disciples of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Moreover, Li Long had indeed killed Zhao Ting. However, Li Long had been locked up by the black donkey, and he hadn’t actually entered the Celestial King Graveyard. He was replaced by Ling Han.

With a Heavenly Venerate helping Ling Han create a fake identity, it would be impossible for others to see through him, even if they were a disciple of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, and even if they were extremely knowledgable about the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

The Seventh Heaven Celestial King carefully interrogated him. In this place, they most detested Celestial Kings who entered to train, using them as whetstones. Thus, the numerous forces had all reached a consensus. If such a person appeared, they would all hunt down and kill them.

However, Ling Han’s replies were all logical and watertight. In the end, the Celestial King organized a place for him to stay. He would head off to corroborate Ling Han’s story.

These were the rules. Everyone who entered would have to experience this.

Ling Han naturally wasn’t worried. Right now, he was none other than Li Long. The black donkey had created a disguise for him, and it was good enough to last for hundreds of millions of years.

Sure enough, the Seventh Heaven Celestial King returned after several days, and handed Ling Han a permit.

Ling Han was slightly astonished as he held the permit. It was indeed good that his identity had been confirmed. However, this place was clearly a cage, yet it was also abundantly obvious that the people here had methods to communicate with those in the outside world. Otherwise, how could they have confirmed his story?

He quickly pushed his astonishment aside. He was here to rapidly increase his cultivation. Nothing else mattered.

“Friend Li, are you interested in joining the Ghost King Army?” the Seventh Heaven Celestial King asked.

Li Long was a disciple of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. Being able to enter this martial academy proved that he was no ordinary monarch tier. Rather, he was someone who was destined to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future. Thus, it was necessary to extend an invitation to such a person.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I’ve been exiled here, so I’m not in a great mood. Let me familiarize with this place myself.”

The Seventh Heaven Celestial King nodded, and said, “That’s fine too. However, Friend Li, once you become familiar with this place, perhaps you’ll discover that it’s akin to heaven.

“Oh, that’s right, I’m Xiang Ming,” he said in self-introduction.

Ling Han nodded, clasping his hands and saying, “Thank you for your interest, Lord Xiang.”

Xiang Ming took his leave. Meanwhile, Ling Han had a permit now, so he had the right to freely travel around the Celestial King Graveyard.

Even though the black donkey had told him some information about the Celestial King Graveyard, it was a Heavenly Venerate, after all, so it wouldn’t show much interest in a place that locked up Celestial Kings. Thus, Ling Han needed to explore the intricacies himself.

Regarding the situation of Ghost King City, he had learned about some of it from Xiang Ming. Add to that his own exploration, and he was gradually forming a good grasp.

Ghost King City was naturally a force. In fact, each city here was an independent force. There were over 20 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings guarding Ghost King City, with the Azure Ghost Celestial King being their leader.

Even though they were all Celestial Kings, there was definitely one among them who was the strongest. This Azure Ghost Celestial King was that person, and he was more so renowned for his vicious nature. According to rumors, he had indulged in slaughter and rape in the past. He had killed heaven knows how many prodigies who had limitless potential, and he had assaulted heaven knows how many female Celestial Kings.

Theoretically speaking, he should have been executed hundreds of times over. However, his uncle was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so he hadn’t been killed. Instead, he had been banished to this place.

The Azure Ghost Celestial King took to this place like a fish to water. He gathered a huge crowd of people who were as debauched as him, founding Ghost King City. Those who submitted to him lived, and those who opposed him died. Even in a terrible place such as the Celestial King Graveyard, Ghost King City was a well-renowned city of slaughter.

This place was indeed filled with murder and death. In just three days, Ling Han had already witnessed seven large battles, of which two involved the death of Celestial Kings. In the other five battles, there were also Celestial Kings who became severely wounded.

Regarding the spark behind these seven battles, however, these were all extremely insignificant events. In fact, these were things that could be resolved with a few sentences. Here, however, they could only be resolved with fresh blood.

Here, benevolence would be a bane.

However, this was also good. Ling Han was here to engage in endless battle. By lingering on the border of life and death, and by being under immense pressure, he’d see his cultivation forced to advance at a rapid speed.

Ling Han set off. Staying in the inn would indeed be slightly safer, but this wasn’t his intention for coming here.

He arrived at the ground floor of the inn, which also served alcohol and food. He ordered a few dishes and also a pot of alcohol. He drank slowly.

Even though this was a land of death, the food was surprisingly quite appetizing and delicious. It was said that the meat all came from Celestial King Tier Immortal Beast. Of course, non-human Celestial Kings could also order the meat of human Celestial Kings to enjoy. Here, there were no rules or regulations.

The alcohol was also fragrant, and even though Ling Han was already a Third Heaven Celestial King, he still felt slightly woozy after taking a few sips.

“Brat, my young master wants to meet you! Come with me!” a Celestial King said as he appeared before Ling Han. He was a sturdily-built middle-aged man who appeared to be around 30 years old.

Ling Han was astonished. He had only just arrived here, so he most certainly hadn’t offended anyone yet. So, why did some random young master want to meet him?

“Who’s your young master?” he asked.

“So you really are a newbie. You don’t even know my young master!” the Celestial King said with a disdainful sneer.

Ling Han felt speechless. Those who could become Celestial Kings should have been talented and ambitious people, yet this person was relishing his role as a lackey?

The Celestial King continued, “My young master is the esteemed Tang Yuan, the only child of Lord Tang Mingbo!”

‘Tang Mingbo?’

Ling Han had heard of this person. Tang Mingbo was one of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings of Ghost King City. Thus, he could also be considered as a ruler of this city. It was no wonder that Tang Yuan was so arrogant and haughty. With a Ninth Heaven Celestial King as his father, he indeed had a powerful background.

However, this still didn’t explain why Tang Yuan had suddenly taken interest in him.

“Huh? Why aren’t you moving?” the Celestial King asked in astonishment. He had already explained Tang Yuan’s identity, yet this brat still dared to remain sitting?

Ling Han pondered for a moment. Even though he had the large black dog and Zhou Heng, they couldn’t help him at all in this place. Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t enter this place, and Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be pummeled into smithereens if they entered. The Celestial King Graveyard was a lawless land.

If he chose to oppose Tang Yuan, it was extremely likely that he would immediately end up at odds with Tang Mingbo.

He had indeed entered this place to battle, and it was inevitable that he would battle with Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the future. However, now wasn’t the time. Just like a person couldn’t become a fatty with a single bite of food, Ling Han couldn’t challenge Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings at this moment, either. Otherwise, he would be beaten black and blue.

Refusing would be a foolish decision. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

So be it. He would head over to see what this Tang Yuan was playing at.

Ling Han stood up, and said nonchalantly, “Lead the way.”

The Celestial King was instantly filled with dissatisfaction. Did this person think he was some big shot? He was a measly Third Heaven Celestial King, worth less than a fart in the Celestial King Graveyard!

He was just about to speak, yet he suddenly caught Ling Han’s gaze, so piercing that it could seemingly reach his heart. He involuntarily shuddered, with an indescribable cold chill running down his spine. He immediately swallowed his words.

Perhaps Tang Yuan could chide such a person. However, he definitely couldn’t provoke him.

He humphed, and said, “Follow me.”

He led the way, guiding Ling Han out of the inn and to a courtyard.

After entering the courtyard, they passed many rooms and hallways before finally arriving in a garden. Here, several young people were drinking and enjoying entertainment. There were also beautiful women performing graceful dances.

With such a scene, who would believe that this was a prison?
