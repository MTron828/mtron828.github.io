2905 Fusion

The more Meng Dong and the others fought, the more they felt it was strange. Could it be that Ling Han was really drunk and completely confused about the situation?

It was really hard to believe. If he wasn’t a drunkard, why would he be so greedy for wine at this time?

They attacked with all their might, wanting to apprehend Ling Han, but they were unable to take him down no matter how hard they tried.

Gulp. Gulp. Ling Han shook the wine pot hard, and discovered that it was already empty. He couldn’t help but sigh. It was only a little bit; it was really too little.

!!

Ling Han swept his gaze over Meng Dong and the others. “Alright, I’ll play with you.”

When he said this, he was no longer drunk at all.

“You, you’re not drunk!” Seeing that Ling Han was so sober, Meng Dong and the others were all shocked.

How could this be possible? There was a trace of their Lord’s power inside, and it was definitely not something that Ling Han could dissolve. However, Ling Han was not affected in the slightest. How could they understand or accept this?

“You didn’t drink it?” Ba Duo asked.

This was also possible. With the strength of a Heavenly Venerate, he could absolutely pretend to drink, and send the wine into another space to temporarily preserve it in reality.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “Why should I tell you?”

The seven of them were speechless. They had already fallen out with each other, so Ling Han naturally had no obligation to tell them the reason.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “However, there’s no harm in telling you. Actually, this is a trap set up by our Lord. The true traitors we want to capture are actually one or several among all of you!”

As soon as this remark came out, Meng Dong and the others were skeptical.

It was absolutely impossible for them to believe that Ling Han could neutralize their Lord’s methods. In that case, could it be that there really was a traitor among them? This time, it was actually a trap within a trap, and they were the ones being tested?

Of course, they themselves all knew that they were innocent, but how could they guarantee that the other six would be the same?

“Don’t believe his nonsense!” Meng Dong immediately said. “This kid is just lying to us. His goal is to disrupt our fighting spirit.”

Not bad.

Lou Xiyue and the others instantly became apprehensive. They couldn’t fall for Ling Han’s evil tricks.

They no longer hesitated, and all of them used their full strength to suppress Ling Han. Shao Ying charged at the very front. He was confident that his defense was invincible, and was definitely not something Ling Han could break through.

Ling Han laughed coldly, and said, “Do you really think that I can’t break your turtle shell?”

He gathered all his strength, and suddenly threw a punch.

Peng!

The power of the punch turned into a point, and hit Shao Ying’s body, immediately blasting a hole in his chest, and causing blood to spurt out wildly.

Meng Dong and the others were all astounded. Ling Han’s power was too terrifying. With just a punch from afar, he had torn Shao Ying’s defenses apart.

Ling Han took advantage of the victory to push his advantage, and with three punches and two kicks, Shao Ying was knocked to the ground. Previously, Ling Han hadn’t used his full strength at all. Under the suppression of absolute power, what was this incomplete Heavenly Venerate Treasured Physique?

When Meng Dong and the others saw this, all of their hearts turned cold. They had already overestimated Ling Han’s strength, so not only did they use tricks, but they also mobilized a total of seven people, all for the sake of making sure that nothing went wrong.

Who would have thought that the wine would be ineffective, and that Ling Han’s battle prowess would completely crush theirs?

Weng, weng, weng. They all channeled first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals, each of them different. They subsequently pressed down upon Ling Han, determined to save Shao Ying no matter what it took.

Ling Han stamped his foot down on Shao Ying, but using this force, he bounced forth, heading straight for Ba Duo. “Haven’t you always wanted to spar with me? Come, I’ll let you get what you want.”

Meng Dong and the others all roared in anger. Ling Han’s foot directly crushed Shao Ying’s head, and once his mind was broken, that Heavenly Venerate would also die.

Peng, peng, peng, Ling Han threw 11 consecutive punches. How could Ba Duo be worthy of contending against him? In an instant, he exploded, turning into a rain of blood.

The six of them1 had the ability to absorb life essence and transform it into their own energy. Therefore, after Shao Ying and Ba Duo died, this energy floated toward the six of them.

Although no one could detect it, in reality, the amount that Ling Han had obtained was a little more than the total amount of these five people combined.

Ling Han unleashed his might, blasting Meng Dong and the others away while snatching over Shao Ying and Ba Duo’s remnant souls. He could use these to extract their Heavenly Venerable Seals; furthermore, he also wanted to pluck their souls to obtain more information about Hysteria.

For example, who were the rest of these people’s accomplices?

Then, he turned around, and said calmly, “Who’s next?”

Meng Dong and the others were all shocked. In just one or two moves, two of their companions had been killed by Ling Han. Then, so what if they still had five people? It would just take Ling Han a few more moves to be finished with them.

Escape?

Could they escape? Ling Han’s strength was crushing them; this was not a battle between equals at all.

“For the main body!” Meng Dong suddenly shouted, his eyes filled with madness.

“For the main body!” Lou Xiyue and the other three also roared. All of them seemed to have turned into lunatics.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, they leaped to the side. Everyone’s entire body glowed, and they actually strangely fused together.

“Although I’ll die today, I’ll only be returning to my original body,” the five of them said. Boom! A ball of incomparably blazing light flashed, and all five of them disappeared. In their place was an indescribable creature.

It looked a little like an octopus. It had many tentacles all over its body, but it also had a human face. When the human face split open, it turned out to be a huge mouth. Its entire body was pitch-black, and emitted an incomparably evil aura.

This was… Hysteria!

No, Ling Han immediately shook his head. Hysteria was far more powerful than this, and the monster in front of him was at most at the Fifth Tier. The difference was too great.

How did these five people become such a monstrous creature?

The power of Hysteria was definitely a contributing factor. Otherwise, how could the five of them have fused together? He had never heard of two Heavenly Venerates being able to fuse as one, let alone five of them. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Since you’ve forced me to this point, I’ll drag you down with me!” the monster said. Its voice was very complicated, as if many people were speaking together, but they were surprisingly united.

The monster attacked. Shua, a tentacle swung out, sweeping towards Ling Han.

There was a Heavenly Venerable Seal glowing on its body, boosting its power by more than 80 times.

It was a first-grade seal.

Meng Dong and the others should each have a first-grade seal. Now that the five of them had fused together, even if these five first-grade seals could not be combined, they could still take turns to display their might.

...

Ling Han met it with a punch. Peng, the fist and the tentacle collided, instantly setting off a terrifying energy storm. In an instant, this huge cave was destroyed. Hong, long, long, large and small pieces of rubble fell, creating a huge commotion.

“Damn it, you forced me to use this move. I only have three days left to live. If I don’t slash your corpse into pieces, the hatred in my heart won’t be appeased!” the monster said as it attacked aggressively.

After being boosted with a first-grade seal, its current strength had already completely surpassed Ling Han’s, and had reached the stage of crushing him.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “So you think you won just like that?”
