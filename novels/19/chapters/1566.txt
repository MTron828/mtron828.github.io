Chapter 1567 Corpse of a Celestial

Ling Han was struck by a sudden realization.These paths didn’t actually exist as a trial for cultivators. Instead, they were here as a means to teach cultivators about formations, from the most foundational stages to more complex stages.

The foot of the mountain allowed cultivators to grasp the foundations of formations. Afterward, the formations would slowly increase in difficulty and teach cultivators how to combine these foundational elements into more complicated and high-level structures. Following this increase in complexity, the formations would naturally become more powerful as well.

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. Even if he eventually failed to obtain the Chaos Source Rock, this trip would still be worth it.

He had already developed a little understanding of Saint-level formations.

“This isn’t the right attitude; you definitely have to find that Chaos Source Rock!” Small Tower exclaimed in discontent.

“I know, I’ll definitely try my best,” Ling Han replied with a sigh. What a hard tower to satisfy.

However, even if there were just a sliver of chance, Ling Han would still try his best. After all, he would be the biggest beneficiary if the Black Tower managed to recover. Moreover, he would also receive one or three power boost opportunities, depending on the amount of power he desired.

There were only a few kilometers remaining until he reached the peak of the mountain. Based on Ling Han’s previous experience, there would only be a dozen or so formations left for him to decipher. However, following their explosive increase in difficulty, he would also need more and more time to decipher them.

By the time he reached the last three formations, there were only 10 days remaining until the time limit of three years was reached.

This evidently wasn’t enough time. Right now, the time he needed to decipher a single formation had already increased to over 10 days. Thus, there was only enough time for him to decipher one of the formations.

Ling Han shook his head in resignation. He had already tried his best, and he truly couldn’t think of any other way.

“Don’t give up!” Small Tower said. As if reaching some resolution, it said, “At the risk of wasting some power, I’m willing to provide you with some help!”

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened. This damned Small Tower had been hiding its power from him this entire time. If it weren’t for something that affected it, perhaps it would have never revealed its true power to him.

“I can increase the effects of the Reincarnation Tree tenfold, but this will cause me to fall into a slumber for the next few days. During this time, you won’t be able to enter or exit the Black Tower,” Small Tower said solemnly.

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this. By the looks of it, Small Tower wasn’t actually hiding its power from him. Rather, the price of it taking action was truly quite large.

Ling Han’s biggest trump card was the Black Tower. If he wasn’t able to use it for a few days, what would he do if he came across a Saint or a Demon Master? He would only be able to withstand a few strikes at most.

However, Small Tower had already reached a resolution, so how could he not have?

“Deal!” Ling Han said with a nod. He was also extremely curious about the peak of Ocean Dragon Mountain.

After memorizing the formations, he entered the Black Tower and started to analyze them under the Reincarnation Tree.

Right now, both the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had given up their positions for him. Thus, the entire power of the Reincarnation Tree was focused solely on his body.

Two days passed, and Ling Han finished deciphering the first formation. Another two days passed, and he finished deciphering the second formation. Then another three days passed, and he finally finished deciphering the third and last formation.

A total of seven days had passed.

Phew!

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. An indescribably magnificent temple appeared before him. It towered three kilometers into the air, and it more so stretched dozens of kilometers into the distance. This temple was held up by innumerable columns, each of which also reached three kilometers in height. Before such colossal columns, Ling Han appeared incredibly tiny and insignificant.

“Brat, don’t forget the Chaos... Source...” Small Tower said with much exertion. However, it was still unable to complete its sentence before falling into silence.

“Small Tower! Small Tower!” Ling Han shouted. However, he received no reply.

In fact, he couldn’t even sense the existence of the Black Tower anymore.

If he had known this, he would have brought the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden out first. However, who knew when Small Tower would awake from its slumber? Three days would pass by in a flash, so how much commotion would he cause if he suddenly returned from this mystery realm with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden by his side?

The others would all wonder about his Spatial God Tool. Why had he been able to bring it into the mystery realm? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Moreover, he had killed Tan Mo, so Tan Feng would definitely target him once he appeared. If the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were by his side, he would simply be putting them in grave and unnecessary danger.

‘Let it be, then.’

Ling Han took a deep breath before stepping forward.

He had already become accustomed to the Black Tower’s existence, and thus he was always unafraid even when faced with severe dangers. This was because he possessed an incredibly powerful trump card. Now, however, he couldn’t use this trump card anymore. He could only rely on himself.

Fortunately, this Ocean Dragon Mountain didn’t look like a deadly place. Quite the contrary, in fact, judging by the educational formations along the way. If he managed to reach the Saint-level in formations in the future, this place would definitely be a huge contributing factor.

There were no gates to the temple, so Ling Han was able to waltz right in. Upon entering the temple, the first thing he did was naturally search for the Chaos Source Rock. He had promised Small Tower that he would do his best to obtain it.

He searched for the Chaos Source Rock everywhere. However, this temple was extremely spacious and also colossal in size. After searching for a moment, Ling Han suddenly stopped in his tracks.

10 corpses had appeared before him.

Of these corpses, eight were men and two were women. All of them appeared to be extremely old. They had all battled to death, and Ling Han could clearly see the sword wounds on their bodies. However, even though they had been killed heavens knew how many years ago, Ling Han still didn’t have the right to even approach them.

There were peculiar projections of the universe and heavenly bodies surrounding these corpses, and these projections took the form of numerous floating bubbles. Looking closely, he could see that each bubble contained a world that was continually transforming and undergoing the cycles of life and death, creation and destruction.

‘Are these genuine worlds, or are they mere illusions?’

Ling Han’s pupils contracted slightly. These 10 people were far more powerful than any being that he had ever seen before. Perhaps he only knew of one person who could rival them.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire!

Meanwhile, the three Phoenix Kings weren’t even on the same level as them.

These were elites from the Celestial Realm!

It was just that they had been far too powerful when alive, so much so that Ling Han couldn’t even fathom their power. Thus, he was unable to determine whether these 10 people had been more powerful when alive, or if the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire had been more powerful.

‘Perhaps these are also victims of the great turmoil?

‘What happened in the Celestial Realm back then? Why were so many elites killed?’

Anyhow, it made sense that Chaos Source Rocks would appear here now. In fact, it was even possible that this entire mystery realm had fallen down from the Celestial Realm.

‘These are the corpses of Celestials! There’s probably still some blood essence and celestial fluid inside their bodies. It’s a pity... that they’re all humans, so I can’t bring myself to retrieve them. Moreover, they’re far too powerful anyway. Not to mention that I can’t use the Black Tower right now, even if I could, I’d still be seeking death if I attempted to approach them with my divine sense.

‘So be it. I’ll look for the Chaos Source Rock first.’

Ling Han pondered for a moment before deciding to honor his promise with Small Tower first.

“Young man!” An old voice suddenly reverberated throughout the temple.

Ling Han’s skin instantly crawled with goosebumps, and he more so felt somewhat stifled.

The ancient sites that others entered were all ordinary ancient sites—they would clear challenges and obtain treasures, with the process being as normal as could be. However, almost none of the ancient sites that he had entered were ordinary ancient sites. They would always be subject to peculiar events such as what he was experiencing now.

However, this was also part of his abilities, no?

After all, who else had managed to reach the peak of this mountain and enter this temple before? Since no one had entered this temple before, it was only natural that no one had heard this voice before either.

‘What the hell is this?’

“Are you dead or alive?” Ling Han asked. Although this question was strange, its importance was in fact very great.

The old voice sounded again, saying, “Rest assured, I’ve already been dead for heavens know how many years. It’s just that I left a wisp of my divine sense inside a Chaos Source Rock before I died, allowing me to exist until now.”

‘Chaos Source Rock!’
