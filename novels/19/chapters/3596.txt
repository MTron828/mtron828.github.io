Chapter 3597: Five Elements Karmic Pill

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s heart jolted. As expected.

The Primordial True Lord had escaped from prison, yet was actually establishing his own sect here. This was extremely illogical in the first place.

There was only one explanation, and that was there was something here they wanted to obtain.

It could be a cultivation technique, a Celestial Plant, or a Spirit Tool, but what could be confirmed was that no matter what this thing was, it must be incredibly precious, and worth them taking such a risk.

…Who knew if the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire would send someone over to investigate on a whim.

“With the current situation, it looks like our Foreign Affairs Department won’t be able to do much.” Ling Han frowned. Now, the small forces had all sided with medium-level forces, while the medium-level forces had all sided with large forces. Though they weren’t as united as a nation, if he went against these small forces, it would be publicly opposing the Spirit Transformation Tier-level force. This was unwise.

“Who would’ve thought that the Spirit Transformation True Lords would actually be in the prison? Otherwise, with His Majesty’s ability, he would be able to suppress them single-handedly,” Princess Bixiao said ruefully.

“Release spies to monitor the world. Those Spirit Transformation True Lords are reluctant to leave this place, so they must be scheming something big,” Ling Han said.

“All right.” Princess Bixiao nodded.

Ling Han looked up at the sky. The setting sun was as bright red as blood, as if it was foreshadowing the imminent commencement of a terrifying massacre.

He even wondered if Chen Fengyan, who had taken the risk to establish the Dark North Nation, was also searching for that “treasure”. Otherwise, as a surviving dreg of the Chen Clan, he would definitely be feared even more by the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire, and they would be pleased to get rid of him.

This night passed, and Ling Han had just finished cultivating when he received reports of five bizarre fires in the Imperial Capital last night.

His first reaction was the little loll and the seven babies.

He called these little girls over, and without even needing him to ask, the little loli excitedly told him about how she had brought seven toddlers to set fire.

“Little girl, you have really been spoilt!” Ling Han stretched out a hand, and grabbed hold of TangYun’er. He pressed her onto his lap, planning to smack her behind.

The little loli’s true cultivation level was only at the Inscription Tier, so how could she be a match for Ling Han? Seeing this, she couldn’t help but kick her legs madly. “Damn Handsome Brother, if you dare hit my bottom, I’ll blast you to death with my lightning cannon!”

“Why don’t you try!” Ling Han said with a straight face. He continued to smack her behind.

“Ah— ” The little loli screamed, but though she was in so much pain that she was tearing up, she actually didn’t use the treasure that was both shuttle and Battle Armor.

Ling Han stopped, and said in irritation, “Stop howling. I only exerted force on the first strike.”

The little loli’s face was covered with tears, as she glared angrily at Ling Han, “You are a bad person!”

“Hehe.” The children laughed, and when they saw Ling Han’s eyes sweep over them, they hurriedly wiped the smiles from their faces, and pointed at the little loli, “Father, it has nothing to do with us. She was the one who led us to do it!” The little girl was instantly dumbfounded. She had been sold just like that?

‘Wayaya, you disloyal people!’

Ling Han rubbed the little loli’s head and said, “What did I tell you before? If you encounter bad people, you can teach them a lesson however you like, but setting fire and causing trouble without any principles will only make you unlikable.”

“Wuwuwu, I won’t dare to do it again!” The little loli sprawled out on Ling Han.

“Still pretending, not even a single tear falling.” Ling Han shook his head.

The little loli raised her head. There were tears, but they had flowed out previously. She pouted, “Bad guy, I don’t want to talk to you anymore!”

Ling Han was curious, and he asked, “Why aren’t you wearing that Battle Armor? I’m definitely no match for you.”

“I knowyou’re doing this for my own good.” The little loli twiddled her fingers, and said very aggrievedly, “But you still hit me. Wu, wu, wu, my behind hurts!” En, this young girl was still completely incurable.

Ling Han smiled and said, “Seeing as you’re so obedient, I’ll take you out for a barbeque.”

“Sure!” The little loli clapped her hands, smiling brightly, but her tears had not even dried, and her appearance was beyond hilarious.

“Father, we want to eat too!” the babies called out one after another.

“All right, let’s all go eat!”

Ling Han even dragged Princess Bixiao along with him. Otherwise, it would really be a little straining for him to deal with eight problematic children all by himself.

The two adults brought their seven babies and a little loli out. After they sat down at the barbeque shop, the people in the shop kept looking over. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was a great beauty.

—That little loli was also extremely beautiful.

—The six children were incredibly adorable.

Tsk, this family was really good at giving birth, especially those six babies. They must have been born from the same womb. How did this great beauty’s stomach fit them in?

Princess Bixiao didn’t know that she had already become a mother. Moreover, she was a super mother that was capable of having six babies at once. Otherwise, she would definitely have exploded and left.

“Handsome Brother, seeing as you’re wholeheartedly thinking for the sake of Little Toffee, I’ll give you some pointers,” the little loli mumbled as she dug into the meat skewers.

This made Ling Han think of Hu Niu. This little girl was very capable, being able to eat and talk at the same time without being affected at all.

He was also getting closer to meeting them!

Ling Han’s heartbeat quickened for a moment, then he asked, “Oh, how does Teacher Little Toffee plan to guide me?” He had only asked casually.

The little loli humphed, and said, “I have seen with my precious light that you have broken through about 70% of the restrictions, and you have only just advanced into Enlightenment Tier. Obviously, you want to break through all the shackles in your body, right?”

Ling Han was surprised. This little lolita could actually see through him so thoroughly?

“And then?” he asked. This time, his expression was much more serious.

“You are indeed very powerful. However, if you continue to cultivate like this, when you reach the end of Mystery Realm Tier, you would only be able to shatter 90% of your shackles at most, and could not possibly reach 100%.” The little loli said.

“Do you have any way to help me reach 100%?” Ling Han’s interest was instantly piqued.

“Of course,” the little loli said proudly.

“Tell me about it,” Ling Han said.

Yet the little girl put on airs, “I am thirsty.”

Ling Han poured a cup of tea and handed it over, saying, “Drink this.”

“I am a bit hot,” the little loli continued.

Ling Han took out a fan and started to fan her.

“My behind hurts!” The little girl pouted.

“…You should quit while you’re ahead,” Ling Han said with a smile, sending a dangerous signal.

Sure enough, the little loli didn’t put on airs anymore. Instead, she said, “You need a Five Elements Karmic Pill now. This can help you break through many shackles of your body, and added with your hard work, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to reach an ethereal and pure body.”

Princess Bixiao, who was listening from the sidelines, was envious, and interrupted, “Then can I eat it?”

“I’ll take a look for you first.” The little loli took out that Clairvoyance, and aimed at Princess Bixiao. She continued to move the Clairvoyance here and there, as if she was observing thoroughly.

“How is it? What have you seen?” Princess Bixiao asked. This little loli started to make a fuss again, and did not speak further.

“Red undergarments.” The little girl lowered her Clairvoyance.

Princess Bixiao’s pretty face instantly flushed red. What kind of child was this!
