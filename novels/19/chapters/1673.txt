Chapter 1674: Selection

Ordinarily, One Star aptitude would have hope of becoming a first severance grand elder, Two Star aptitude would become second severance, and Three and a half Stars would be qualified to aim for fourth severance.

Of course, all of this was theory.

However, there was one fact that could be confirmed. Three and a half Stars aptitude might not be able to become fourth severance, but those that could become fourth severance would need to have at least Three and a half Stars aptitude.

Gasp!

Ding Xiaochen looked at Ling Han jealously. This was too inconceivable; a lowly commoner actually had Three and a half Stars aptitude! Even he would only be able to become a third severance grand elder at most.

Though aptitude was not unchangeable, if one had cultivated a different cultivation technique or consumed some super Celestial medicine, it was completely possible that aptitude could be increased or decreased, but how could it possibly be changed without a unique opportunity?

If he had known that Ling Han and the Empress had only taken the test very casually, and their true potential surpassed three and a half stars, just what kind of expression would he have on his face?

“Passed, your serial number is 5574.” The examiner stood up again, and handed the plaque to Ling Han.

Perhaps Ling Han would be another “Mao Dai” after many years, and become a new legend.

“What is your name, and where do you come from?” Mao Shuyu’s eyes shone as she looked Ling Han up and down.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and replied, “My name is Ling Han. I have just entered into Dark Moon City. Previously, I have been residing in a mountain forest, right until a beast stampede exploded not too long ago. Many of the residents of our village either died or moved elsewhere, so we came to Dark Moon City to seek refuge.”

This was the explanation that he, the Empress, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, and the large black dog had agreed upon.

“Ling Han?” Ding Xiaochen also walked over. He looked down proudly on Ling Han. “I will give you a wonderful opportunity to become my follower—don’t think that this is an insult to you. In truth, who knows how many prodigies and elites want to become my followers, but were not given this chance at all.”

He naturally was not planning to support Ling Han, but simply wanted to have this super genius by his side so he could simply think of a method to get him killed in future.

The top prodigy of Dark Moon City... It was enough for him alone to bear such a title. There was no need for another to share the title for him, what more surpass him.

“I am not interested.” Ling Han naturally refused.

Ding Xiaochen’s expression darkened, and he threatened, “Brat, don’t be ungrateful!”

“Hoho.” Ling Han was too lazy to even respond to him this time, and only laughed.

“Ignore him!” Mao Shuyu scoffed, and said, “Ding Xiaochen, let me warn you not to mess around. I plan to introduce this person to Father, and see if he has any interest in taking a disciple. If you have any ideas that you shouldn’t have, then even if you are a member of the Ding Clan, Father will still dare to behead you!”

Ding Xiaochen’s fingers involuntarily moved slightly. This was a sign that he was extremely furious. He stared at Ling Han for a while, a cold smirk appearing on his lips.

He was merely in the high extreme, so even if he had three and a half stars aptitude, so what? He had the advantage of more than a whole minor level; wouldn’t that be enough to compensate for that gap of half a star of aptitude?

It was inevitable for the glint of cold steel to emerge in the subsequent selection. So what if he beat him to death then?

Rules would be rules!

He did not speak further, but the killing intent in his eyes could not be any more obvious.

Ling Han was displeased internally, and thought that it would be great if he could also borrow the name of the Roc Palace. He could simply kill a hateful guy like this, and would not have to worry about retaliation from the force behind him.

However, he had promised Hu Yu that he would raze the Ding Clan to the ground. At first, he was not the type to bring disaster to others. No matter how notorious a clan was, there would still be a few good people and innocents among its members.

Yet now, his attitude became firm. Whether your Ding Clan had any good people or not, he was determined to destroy it.

“Those who have received a place may advance and begin the next selection.” A middle-aged man dressed in military attire appeared. He was a peak stage Saint King, and could be called a supreme elite in the Ancient Realm, yet was only an ordinary military officer here.

And this was still because Dark Moon City was a One Star City. If this was a Second Star or Three Star City, he might only be able to become a foot soldier of the lowest rank.

More than 5,000 people walked forwards, and arrived at the foot of the mountains.

The military officer took one step forwards, and said, “To those who have passed through the selection today, I will be your military instructor for the next 100 years! I do not care who you are. Now that you are here, and have fallen under my supervision, you all are just soldiers, understand?”

“Understood!” more than 5,000 people all shouted loudly.

“Additionally, my name is Tu Kang. You all may address me as Instructor Tu,” the military officer continued. “And now, let me announce the rules of the selection—setting out from here, you will have to climb nine mountains. There are many Blood Shadow Wolves there, and their strength ranges from the Eternal River Tier to Genesis Tier. What you all have to do is to bring the tail of a single Blood Shadow Wolf back.”

He paused, and then repeated, “Only the first 1,000 people that bring back the tail of a Blood Shadow Wolf will be qualified to become reserve troops of the Dark Moon Army. As for the others... I do not care what the reason is, all of you will be eliminated!

“In this period of time, all of you are responsible for your own lives! If you fear death, you can scram now!”

Actually, everyone knew these rules already. For some, this was not their first time undergoing this test, but there were some first-timers who were starting to hesitate. At first, they had thought that they could be fearless, but now that they had reached this step, they were still afraid.

Over 300 people chose to give up, but those remaining still exceeded 5,000, so the elimination rate was going to be very high.

“Then... set out!” Tu Kang snapped his fingers, and then sat down.

Boom, more than 5,000 people immediately charged out. Strength was not the only factor in the selection, there was also the factor of luck. For example, though Eternal River Tiers could not possibly be a match for Genesis Tiers, if they were lucky and encountered an Eternal River Tier Blood Shadow Wolf, they would still have a chance of becoming one of the first 1,000 people.

“Follow me.” Mao Shuyu was very trustworthy, and beckoned Ling Han and the Empress over. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ling Han and the Empress didn’t mind, and followed her. The three of them used their respective movement techniques, and traversed through the mountain forests.

In the Ancient Realm, the speed of Saints was about the same—aside from those Genesis Tiers that focused on cultivating Regulations of Time, who could have an advantage in speed. However, in the Celestial Realm, the speed of Genesis Tiers varied.

That was because the Regulations of the Celestial Realm were more complete, and the structure of the heaven and earth here was incredibly sturdy. If one wanted to possess high speed, he would have to overcome various obstacles, and this led to the speed of Genesis Tiers varying.

Saint Kings were definitely faster than Great Saints, and Great Saints were definitely faster than Medium Saints. Of course, this did not apply to two such freaks like Ling Han and the Empress.

Mao Shuyu did not know this fact, so she took the initiative to slow down. She was worried that if she went full speed ahead, Ling Han and the Empress would lose track of her. However, this kind of speed was already fast enough. After all, there were only over 300 Saint Kings that participated this time round.

In the selection round, 1,000 candidates was enough. Those who performed better would just have to stand up earlier in the battle for the position of team captain, and this did not matter at all to her. With enough strength, what did she have to fear?

Ding Xiaochen, meanwhile, followed behind them, looking like an eagle that was hunting its prey. Once Mao Shuyu had the slightest moment of carelessness, he would release a swift strike and deal with Ling Han.

If Mao Shuyu had not been present, Ling Han actually would have been very happy to lead Ding Xiaochen to a remote place, and deal with this bastard, but he could not kill Mao Shuyu too to keep her from leaking the secret, right?

He gave Ding Xiaochen the middle finger, and mouthed a curse word at him. Having been around the large black dog and the others for so long, if Ling Han was determined to anger someone, he really had a lot of methods at his disposal.

‘Holy! F*ck!’

Ding Xiaochen’s face involuntarily darkened. He swore that if Ling Han were to fall into his hands, he would definitely make his death an agonizing one!
