Indeed, with the power upgrade from the Barbarian Bull Spiritual Talisman, though there was no surge to Ding Yuan Xin’s speed, there was still a little increase. After a few steps, he soon caught up with Ling Han.

“Do you think you’re the only one with a Spiritual Talisman?” Ling Han laughed. He drew out the final Swift Cloud Talisman and smacked it onto his body. Instantly, his speed shot up.

There was a maximum limit to the effectiveness of the Swift Cloud Talisman. For a user in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, the speed upgrade it offered was only about 20%. However, Ling Han was still in the eighth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, and thus the upgrade he got still doubled his original speed. Instantly, he once again distanced himself from Ding Yuan Xin.

Ding Yuan Xin could not help but grit his teeth. He drew out a trump card, and Ling Han would draw a trump card of his own to deal with it. Could he really kill this unbelievably young elite?

He ceased his advance and gave the matter some consideration, then decided to give up hunting down Ling Han. Not only that, he also decided that he would leave the north region and venture into the middle state. Otherwise, if he continued to stay in the north region, perhaps he would need another ten-plus years before he could manage to break through to the Flower Blossom Tier.

Leave!

Anyone who could manage to make it to the Prodigy Roll naturally had no lack of a decisive will. He immediately exited the Dark Devil Forest and headed directly to the middle state without even returning to his own clan.

Ling Han naturally did not know of Ding Yuan Xin’s decision. After he recovered from his injuries, he began to leave behind carved messages to provoke Ding Yuan Xin again. But even after five days had passed, he still did not see Ding Yuan Xin appear—he guessed that the latter might have given up his plans on hunting him down.

Surprisingly decisive of him.

Ling Han nodded. Ding Yuan Xin had seen the treasure that he had and could still leave so decisively; he was indeed a character.

Still, without a sparring partner, he could only work hard and train on his own.

Thankfully, he was already in the middle period of the eighth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, which was already quite fast.

Ling Han still continued to search for various Spiritual Herbs on one end, as well as cultivating on the other. A month had passed and he successfully gained two types of Spiritual Herbs that the Black Tower did not have yet. Furthermore, his cultivation level finally reached the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier.

“If you refine the Heavenly Luck Stone at this moment and use the instillation of power from the Black Tower, you will be able to maximize the effects,” Small Tower hinted.

Ling Han nodded agreeably and drew out a piece of the Heavenly Luck Stone.

This was actually a stone bead, and when he crushed it, the inside turned out to be hollow. There was a kind of liquid inside there; the refreshing fragrance of this liquid wafted into his nose. Meanwhile, Hu Niu also took out a piece and similarly sat in a cross-legged position. She was even more direct; she simply threw the piece of Heavenly Luck Stone into her mouth and chewed on it for a bit. Ka, ka, ka , and the rock was crushed.

However, there was no odd signs at all. What “feeling as if your insides were boiling, and waves in your sea of consciousness”—it was as if nothing happened at all.

Ling Han knew that the Heavenly Luck Stone’s effects would only be seen when he broke through to the next tier. It would allow the cultivator’s battle prowess to instantly soar up another four or five Battle Stars. Exactly how much the increase would be would depend on how sturdy the foundations for the cultivation level was.

Ling Han had not eaten this thing in his last life, but he had obtained one for the sake of his smallest disciple, Jiang Yue Feng. That brat only had seven Battle Stars of battle prowess in the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, but when he broke through to the Flower Blossom Tier, he actually still had six Battle Stars of battle prowess!

The higher one’s cultivation level, the more difficult it would be to challenge a stronger opponent. If it was not for the Heavenly Luck Stone, Jiang Yue Feng would only have a maximum of three Battle Stars when he broke through to the Flower Blossom Tier, so that was proof of how awesome the Heavenly Luck Stone was.

Ling Han mused ruefully for a moment, then exited the Black Tower together with Hu Niu. They began to head towards where the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass was growing.

They hadn’t walked for very long, when Ling Han felt a shiver creep up his back. He immediately stopped walking and said, “Old wretch from the Thousand Corpse Sect, how long do you intend to keep following me?”

Elder Nine Clouds walked out of the dense forest, a hint of confusion in his eyes.

He had witnessed Ling Han enter the midst of the Demonic Qi with his very eyes. That was something that even he was wary of and dared not come into contact with. Yet Ling Han not only walked out of it alive, he looked extremely lively and conscious. There was absolutely no sign that he had been turned insane by the Demonic Qi.

Exactly how many treasures did this brat possess?

Elder Nine Clouds’ greed blazed. He knew that Ling Han could enter the Black Tower, and so had been trying to find a chance to attack at a time when Ling Han was unguarded the most to kill him instantly. Otherwise, if he once again allowed Ling Han to duck into the Black Tower, then he could only return without achieving anything.

“Young man, you have already drawn the attention of our sect. Even if I cannot do anything to you, there will be even more even stronger people appearing next time to take your life and snatch away your good fortune. They are also going to refine you into a Corpse Soldier!” he forced out through clenched teeth. He had never imagined that a junior in the Spiritual Ocean Tier would be so hard to deal with.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and asked curiously, “How strong are they?”

“Hehe, do you want to probe me? You are really too naïve; do you think that I’m a three-year-old kid?” Elder Nine Clouds sneered.

Ling Han drew out a stalk of ginseng and said, “Be good. Tell me, and I’ll give you a stalk of ginseng.”

F***!

Elder Nine Clouds was driven to fuming rage. Did this brat really think of him as a dog that he would tempt him in this way!? His eyes looked like they were about to spit fire. He declared, “Junior, if I do not refine you into a skinned Corpse Soldier, I swear that I will no longer be human!”

“You speak as if you are still human,” Ling Han mocked.

“Die!” Elder Nine Clouds shouted harshly.

“The only one who will die is you!” A booming voice resounded and a sturdy figure emanating an oppressive aura shot out.

“Fist Emperor!” Elder Nine Clouds’ aged eyes tensed, and he showed signs of wariness.

Though the other had not broken through to the Flower Blossom Tier for very long, he had managed to form Fist Ray already, and had even managed to battle the Golden Blood Demonic Ape to a standstill. One could not help but tremble in the face of such battle prowess. Moreover, the Thousand Corpse Sect depended on the Corpse Soldiers they controlled, their personal battle prowess was not too impressive.

Furthermore, though the other had suffered injuries after battling the Golden Blood Demonic Ape, noy only had he recovered from his injuries after so many days, his ability had also advanced further as he had broken through to the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. One could not help but gasp at the fact that he could still advance so fast even after he had broken through to the Flower Blossom Tier.

The Rain Emperor was a dominating figure. When his eyes turned upon Elder Nine Clouds, an endless killing intent appeared in them. “Monster from the Thousand Corpse Sect, kill!” He curled his hand into a fist and delivered a punch. The Fist Ray appeared in bright brilliance. This was a deadly weapon that had exceeded Qi. One could say that even if Ling Han managed to form thirty flashes of Sword Qi, they would still be unable to stand against the weakest Fist Ray. This was a one-sided domination due to the difference in quality.

Of course, if Ling Han managed to condense the thirty flashes of Sword Qi into Sword Ray, then that naturally would give him a dominating advantage against a Fist Ray that had been condensed from ten flashes of Qi.

Although Elder Nine Clouds was in the fifth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, he was completely incapable of standing against the Rain Emperor, who had already formed Fist Ray. Within a few moves, he was already wailing. He exclaimed harshly, “Fist Emperor, I do not want to become your enemy, but if you continue to be overbearing, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

“So what if I am? Any person that I want to kill has never managed to survive!” The Rain Emperor used the Son of Heaven Fist Technique; the Fist Ray moved with a brilliance, possessing terrifying might behind it.

Elder Nine Clouds gave a sharp whistle, and a strange noise was immediately heard from some distance away. Very soon, an iron coffin slid over. Peng , the coffin lid shot open and a Corpse Soldier jumped out. It was completely silver in color, as if it was forged from silver.

“Level Three Silver Armored Corpse,” Ling Han said. This Corpse Soldier had reached the limit for a Silver Armored Corpse.

“Kaka, that’s right. This is a Level Three Silver Armored Corpse. After my various methods of tempering and refining, its ability is now close to the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier!” Elder Nine Clouds haughtily declared. “Fist Emperor, it’s still possible for you to leave now— ***** F****!”

He didn’t finish and cursed—that was because one of the fists of the Rain Emperor had already shot forward grandly.
