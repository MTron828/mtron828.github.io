Chapter 2582: Comprehensive Loss

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They all returned.

Ling Han was still investigating the Ascending Dragon Pill. This was a local specialty, and he had never seen it anywhere else before.

This caused him to speculate in his mind. Perhaps the Ascending Dragon Pill used some kind of ingredient that only existed in this place.

In that case, if he took some Ascending Dragon Pills with him when he left, just how great a fortune would he make? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

To raise the cultivation of Celestial Kings was a power that only Heavenly Venerates could possess. However, the Ascending Dragon Pills could increase the chance of advancing to the next level by 10 percent. This was simply incredible.

Theoretically speaking, as long as one took enough Ascending Dragon Pills, they would definitely succeed in breaking through if they made 10 attempts.

Just the thought of this was terrifying.

While Ling Han was lost in thought about this, Tang Yuan received a letter from his father.

A Celestial King appeared, with five ribbons of iridescent light around him. He clasped his hands in respect when he saw Tang Yuan, saying, “My respects to Young Master.”

Tang Yuan didn’t think much of Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings, and he casually raised his hand before asking, “What’s the matter?”

“The Lord has a command for Young Master,” the Celestial King replied as he retrieved a letter. There was a unique symbol on this letter, and it would shatter and disappear once the letter was opened. Thus, one could easily determine whether their letter had been tampered with.

Tang Yuan accepted the letter, though he didn’t open it on the spot. He simply waved his hand, and said, “Alright, understood. You can leave now.”

However, the Celestial King remained unmoving, saying, “The Lord commanded you to immediately open the letter.”

Tang Yuan faltered upon hearing this, and displeasure instantly spread across his face. This person actually dared to hurry him up?

He was just about to unleash his anger. However, after some thought, he decided to endure this. Since his father had given such an order, this was definitely an important matter.

He opened the letter. However, as he read over it, his face instantly became beet-red, and it was as if flames were about to explode from his eyes.

“Bastard!” He immediately slammed his hand on the table and stood up, pointing at the Celestial King, and roaring, “You actually dared to forge a letter from my father to humiliate me?!”

“How would I dare? This is indeed a command from the Lord!” the Celestial King said in a solemn voice. He remained upright and dignified.

Tang Yuan surprisingly calmed down as he read the letter again.

This was indeed his father’s writing. Moreover, the seal had also been unique to his father, and there had been no sign of any tampering.

However, he genuinely didn’t dare to believe this. This was because his father had surprisingly told him to immediately visit Lu Li and apologize to him. If he couldn’t satisfy Lu Li, there would be no need for him to return. He would disown his son.

Tang Yuan’s hands were shaking. There was also an extra request in the letter, telling him to wear a dress when he walked over.

This was far too terrifying!

He had said before that instead of yielding to Lu Li, he would rather wear a floral dress and run around on the streets. Now, however, Tang Mingbo was commanding him to do exactly this!

Lu Li’s power… had far exceeded his expectations.

He had only dared to oppose Lu Li because his father was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Now, however, even Tang Mingbo was refusing to support him, and instead choosing to support Lu Li. This instantly caused him to feel empty inside. Amid his boundless fury and vexation, he also felt an intense sense of apprehension.

It was no wonder that Yang Xiaoling had become like that. Even their fathers were heaping pressure on them, so what could they do?

He powerlessly sat down. After a long while, he finally said, “I understand…”

“I’ll take my leave now,” the Celestial King said as he turned around to leave.

Tang Yuan remained silent for a long time. A bitter smile appeared on his face. His father had already issued such a command, so did he dare to disobey?

He had initially thought that he had finally won a battle against Lu Li. In the end, however, he had actually suffered a resounding loss. Even his father stood behind Lu Li.

He recalled Lu Li’s words at this moment, telling him to also bring Ling Han over. At this moment, a cold smile slowly spread across his face.

Ling Han was a wanton and fearless person. If he locked horns with Lu Li… Hehe… Hehehehe… Anyhow, that would have nothing to do with Tang Yuan. The latter would immediately make that clear.

He immediately stood up, walking over to find Ling Han.

“Li Long, something important has come up. Follow me to… Please come with me.” He was filled with anger, so his words were inevitably forceful as well. However, he immediately corrected himself.

Ling Han glanced at him, and asked, “What matter?”

‘F*ck me dead! What the f*ck are you asking for? If I tell you to come, then f*cking come with me? Where the f*ck are you getting all this nonsense from? Is this the proper attitude for an underling?’

However, he immediately controlled himself. This was not the time to turn against Ling Han. Right now, the most important thing was to trick Ling Han into meeting Lu Li.

He hurriedly said, “I need to attend a feast and have another battle with Lu Li, so I need your help.”

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “Alright.”

They immediately set off. However, immediately after leaving, Tang Yuan tore away his outer layer of clothes, revealing a floral dress.

Even as someone who didn’t fear heaven or earth, Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace upon seeing this.

‘What’s going on?

‘Has something gone wrong with his brain? Or has he been possessed?’

However, if Ling Han had witnessed the battle between Tang Yuan and Lu Li from beginning to end, he would have immediately guessed that Tang Yuan had suffered a comprehensive loss. However, he hadn’t been present, so he merely found this very strange.

Tang Yuan’s face was also burning with embarrassment. However, he forced a smile, and said, “The main theme of this feast is cross-dressing…” However, upon seeing Ling Han’s face darken, he hurriedly said, “You don’t need to, you don’t need to!”

The two of them walked across the city, and it was inevitable that they would pass many people. All of them wore strange expressions as they looked at Tang Yuan, and even Ling Han was the subject of many sideways glances.

These were two freaks!

However, most people recognized Tang Yuan, and they didn’t dare to offend this young master. After all, who would want to invite death? They all ran away after stealing a single glance at him. This kind of depraved and freakish young master had nothing to do with them.

After walking for an hour, they arrived at Lu Li’s residence.

There were two guards at the gate, and they both burst into laughter when they saw Tang Yuan.

This was the young master of the Tang Clan! Right now, however, he was actually wearing a floral dress! He had truly lost all face!

Others were afraid of Tang Yuan, but they weren’t afraid at all. This was because their master was Lu Li!

Ling Han frowned when he saw this.

If the main theme of the feast was cross-dressing, would these two guards dare to laugh at Tang Yuan? Even if they were audacious and naive, they still wouldn’t dare to do so.

Something was not right.

He immediately roared, “Impudence! You actually dare to laugh at Young Master Tang?!”

One of the guards immediately humphed, and said, “Young Master Tang? Before our young master, he’s nothing but trash! He’s coming to apologize, yet you still dare to act with such arrogance? Are you seeking death?”

Ling Han immediately came to a realization. As it turned out, Tang Yuan had come here to surrender. It was no wonder that he was wearing a floral dress. Tsk, tsk, tsk, he was truly showing utmost sincerity.

However, why had he dragged him along?

A cold smile spread across Ling Han’s face as he looked at Tang Yuan. However, he remained silent.

Tang Yuan instantly felt a mountain of pressure, with cold sweat pouring down his forehead. He had initially thought that he could trick Ling Han into Lu Li’s residence. At that time, Ling Han would have no ability to cause a commotion. Now, however, Ling Han had already connected the dots before entering?

“No need to worry. I didn’t say that I wouldn’t enter,” Ling Han said with a smile. He wanted to see just what kind of grand and dangerous place this was.

Tang Yuan instantly felt as if a huge load had been taken off his shoulders, and he hurriedly said, “Thank you, Big Brother Long, thank you, Big Brother Long.”

His emotions were fluctuating so greatly that he even started to refer to Ling Han as Big Brother Long.

The two guards were astonished upon hearing this. This person was far too freakish! Even Tang Yuan referred to him as big brother?

Just who in the world was this?
