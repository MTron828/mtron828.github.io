Chapter 237: Chi Hua Lan

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han gave the spatial ring to Hu Niu with something in mind—Hu Niu had too big an appetite, so even if she got lost by accident, she wouldn’t have to worry about hunger when having a spatial ring filled with food.

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan could only accept it and nod, but at the same time, they sighed in relief; there was only one ring, so if it were gifted to either one, the other would be inevitably dejected.

…Could they not contend against even a little girl?

The next few days, Ling Han always felt the atmosphere was a bit strange. The times Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan argued were less and less, making him feel as if the sun rose from the west—it was simply unbelievable.

After yet another day, Ling Han finally found the place as told in the logbook. On the riverside were two stone columns that unexpectedly reached 330 meters tall, their features very distinct—here was where the hidden stump was.

They waited—after five hours, black poles suddenly surfaced continuously. They definitely didn’t come from the bottom of the river—it was like at the central hall, they were appearing out of thin air.

Ling Han was not hesitant, and said, “You guys go in first!” His large hand curled, bringing the three girls into the Black Tower while he leapt out. Shua, shua, shua, he was like a dragonfly dotting on water as the tips of his toes tapped on each stump, swiftly sweeping over and towards the other side of the river.

Shua , at this moment, a graceful figure flew out, following tightly behind Ling Han.

Ling Han took a sudden stride forward, and arrived at the opposite bank. Taking a look back, he saw a lady was also crossing the river. After a glance, he involuntarily glanced at the girl who was surprisingly at Spiritual Ocean Tier!

Another close look, and Ling Han couldn’t help being stunned.

Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan both counted as exceptionally beautiful, and their reputation was far-reaching in the Imperial City, where they were called Twin Pearls; however, they obviously paled in comparison to this lady. This girl was definitely a beauty that could be ranked among the top ten Ling Han had seen in his entire life, even breaking into top three.

…With the fact that he was a Heaven Tier in his previous life, how many beauties had he seen? Countless! This girl could rank top ten, that meant she certainly was exceptionally beautiful, simply beyond the mortal sense.

The key was that she was young, at most twenty years old.

A twenty year old cultivator in the Spiritual Ocean Tier, even Ling Han nodded in acknowledgement. Placed amongst the geniuses he encountered in his prior life, she would make the grade.

How could such a genius come out from a place as small as the Nine Nations of the Desolate North?

“Fairy Chi! Fairy Chi!” A holler came from the opposite riverbank. Gu Feng Hua’s figure appeared, he obviously came here chasing the girl.

Ling Han suddenly recalled that this guy said he’d encountered an exceptional fairy, and followed that fairy into the mystery realm; it seemed like this was that girl.

She certainly was stunningly beautiful.

However, at this moment, a change suddenly occurred.

The stumps disappeared.

Not one after another, but all of them disappeared in an instant, as if they never existed before. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Feng Hua suddenly halted. He was a pervert for sure, but he wasn’t an idiot; he wouldn’t dare cross the thunder river.

The girl was also shocked, but not at all panicked. As she shouted lightly, flames gushed out of her body and formed a propulsive force that made her rapidly falling figure halt suddenly, gliding towards the opposite riverbank.

Her white clothes fluttered, and the flames danced; she was like a flying fairy.

Gu Feng Hua was suddenly lost in relaxation and carefreeness as he stared, but then he immediately gave himself a slap and said, “Now’s not the time to admire! Beauty Chi, go for it! You can do it!”

This guy was truly a buffoon!

Ling Han shook his head, and as his gaze swept pass the girl, he knew that the girl had no chance to reach the opposite bank.

The girl obviously knew this too, and her delicate face showed an unreconciled expression—was she going to die here out of carelessness?

Shua , at this moment, a metal silk like that of a silkworm shot out and wrapped around her thin waist. A massive force surged, pulling her rapidly towards the opposite riverbank.

She wouldn’t miss such a chance—she borrowed this force to straighten her back, instantly unleashing a surprising elasticity as she pulled her body upwards in an unimaginable manner.

Ling Han retracted his hand, and xiu , the Origin Gold turned back into a bracelet.

With this external force’s support, the girl lightly fell to the ground. Her body trembled fiercely and she spat out some blood.

…When she’d burst with flames, it cost her a lot.

“Good!” Seeing the girl land firmly onto the ground, Gu Feng Hua instantly jumped in joy. He waved at Ling Han and said, “As expected of the man I think highly of, good job!”

Those words sounded so uncomfortable that Ling Han instantly shivered—as expected of a pervert.

The girl took out a medicinal pill to swallow, and then nodded at Ling Han. “Thank you.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It’s nothing, no need for formalities.”

“Having her life saved, Chi Hua Lan must repay it,” the girl said again with a prudent expression.

Since she was so insistent, Ling Han nodded and said, “Ok, but no need to repay it with your body.”

Pah!

Chi Hua Lan instantly spat in her thoughts—even if you wanted to, there was no way. She would never marry an average man. However, with this joke, her tone was colder. “You don’t have to worry about that!”

“Ling Han, take care of Fairy Chi!” Gu Feng Hua yelled out from the opposite riverbank, obviously not willing to be a lightbulb.

“You know that man?” Chi Hua Lan asked Ling Han with a hint of disdain in her eyes.

Ling Han was speechless, he and this pervert crossed paths twice and they already became friends? He nodded and said, “He is my friend.”

The disdain in Chi Hua Lan’s eyes worsened; one who made friends with a pervert could not be any more normal oneself. She spoke no more. She would repay him for saving her life, but she definitely didn’t want to associate herself with Ling Han in any other way; even exchanging another word felt disgusting.

Ling Han took notice of her expression and inwardly sneered. He saved her on a whim. Every moment, a talented cultivator would lose their life accidentally somewhere in the wide world, so her death wouldn’t make much difference.

He paid no more attention to her and looked ahead.

From here on was the true mystery realm that only few have set foot on in several thousand years.

However… nothing could be seen clearly!

It was very strange. Separated by the thunder river, it could be clearly seen that mountains and forests were here, and the land could be clearly seen five thousand meters away. However, at this side of the river, there was fog everywhere—things couldn’t even be clearly seen three meters away, let alone five thousand meters.

‘Strange!’ Ling Han and Chi Hua Lan both thought.

This was the effect of a formation.

“It’s extremely dangerous here, so I advise you to stay here. Wait for the floating bridge to appear again and head to the opposite shore. Don’t lose your life in vain,” Chi Hua Lan said.

This girl was unexpectedly cold on the outside, but warm on the inside.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Thanks for your concern.”

“Only ghosts would be concerned about you!” Chi Hua Lan snorted. “I just don’t want you to die before I repay you for saving my life.”
