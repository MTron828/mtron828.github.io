2748 Battling a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate

Ling Han was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. This explained why he hadn’t been targeted by heaven and earth. Moreover, Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates naturally couldn’t wield the seven most powerful powers.

The problem was, however, that this Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could rival Second Tier Heavenly Venerates? Had the world been turned upside down?

An Tayun was also stunned. “How is this possible?!”

Thinking carefully about his previous exchange with Ling Han, however, he realized that he had been enraged, and thus had failed to make any observations. Mulling over it now, sure enough, he discovered that Ling Han hadn’t used any fundamental power of heaven and earth.

!!

This person was powerful in his own right, so much so that he could even rival Second Tier Heavenly Venerates.

“It can’t be, right?” Ling Feifan also murmured. F*ck! His grandpa was far too powerful, no?

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate being able to battle against a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate? This was a never-before-seen accomplishment.

“A mere Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate dares to challenge me?” Yang Zhihe bellowed in rage after coming to his senses. Just like the other cultivation tiers, there were also huge gulfs between each minor level in the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were nothing more than just that; they were far weaker than Second Tier Heavenly Venerates.

“So what if you’re a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate? See how I pummel you!” Ling Han said coldly. Today, he would slay a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate for fun.

“Die!” Yang Zhihe roared as he launched a powerful attack. He directly unleashed a Heavenly Venerate Technique, with two balls of white flames appearing in his hands. With a single sweeping motion, he thrust them toward Ling Han.

Yang Xuanlong had also unleashed the same technique before, but the two balls of flames had only transformed into snakes. Now, however, it was completely different, with the two balls of flames transforming into heaven-scorching flames that spread through the sky.

Ling Han humphed as he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, causing a golden bell to materialize around him, symbols flashing on its surface.

He then charged at Yang Zhihe, swinging his fists with fury and ferocity.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Yang Zhihe naturally wouldn’t back down, choosing to face Ling Han head-on.

Heavenly Venerates all tempered their bodies with the seven fundamental powers. The higher their cultivation, the more of these powers they would be able to draw on. First Tier Heavenly Venerates could only draw on a single power, while Second Tier Heavenly Venerates could draw on two. This was as clear as could be.

Heavenly Venerates naturally all possessed powerful Body Arts, yet because the Regulations were capped at the Ninth Heaven, such abilities could only be used as supportive ones.

Yang Zhihe’s Body Art was no weaker than that of Ling Han. After all, he was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate who had already tempered his body with one of the six fundamental powers. Moreover, he had been at this cultivation level for heaven knew how many epochs.

The two of them exchanged blows, with each collision causing the space around them to shatter. Countless celestial bodies fell, affecting the entire Martial Crystalline Dimension.

Thus, only a few days passed before several other Heavenly Venerates hurried over.

This was an intense battle between Heavenly Venerates, so how could they dismiss it?

There were Second Tier Heavenly Venerates, First Tier Heavenly Venerates, and also Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. Even though this was a low-level dimension, it was already infinitesimally close to being a medium-level dimension. Thus, there was a respectable number of Heavenly Venerates.

When they discovered that Yang Zhihe’s opponent was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, they couldn’t help but gawk in surprise, speechless with shock.

How could such a ferocious Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate exist in the world?

“Brother An, do you know of this person’s background?” a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate asked An Tayun.

‘The grandfather of my daughter’s future husband?’

An Tayun naturally wouldn’t say this, so he could only shake his head and reply, “I’m not sure, either.” This was indeed the truth. Apart from Ling Han’s name, he didn’t know anything else about him.

The elites were all extremely curious. At the same time, they also remained slightly on guard. This was because this Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate certainly wasn’t from their realm. In case he was from the Promise City Realm… would he perhaps bring change to the already foregone conclusion?

“Annihilating the Promise City Realm and raising the level of our dimension, thereby allowing us to comprehend the fundamental power of the Genesis World, is an opportunity of a lifetime. We can’t let anyone ruin our plans,” the elites said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Once Yang Zhihe was defeated, they would immediately charge forward to attack. They wouldn’t give Ling Han the opportunity to leave alive.

Of course, only the Second Tier and First Tier Heavenly Venerates would have the right to attack. Even so, the First Tier Heavenly Venerates would still have to team up first lest they wanted to be obliterated in a flash.

An Tayun pondered for a moment before saying, “Perhaps this person has come from a higher-level dimension.”

The elites exchanged glances with each other. Even though the neighboring medium-level dimension hadn’t invaded them, they had still set up a comprehensive defensive line at the Two Realm Passageway. Elites constantly guarded this area.

Indeed, they should already burn incense to the gods to thank the fact that this higher-level dimension hadn’t invaded them. Would they dare to take initiative to launch an attack?

Thus, they knew nothing about the neighboring medium-level dimension. Moreover, no one from that dimension had ever traveled over, either, with absolutely no communication between the two dimensions. They coexisted in a peaceful manner, with neither side offending the other.

Was this person… genuinely an elite from the medium-level dimension?

This was possible!

Because this Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was far too powerful. It was very likely that only higher-level dimensions could raise such a freak.

They all became hesitant. If Ling Han were truly a cultivator from that higher-level dimension, did that signify that their neighboring dimension was finally planning to target them?

The higher level a dimension, the more numerous and more powerful their elites would be. This was just like how they could suppress the Promise City Realm. Moreover, even if that dimension wasn’t much more powerful than them, this still meant that they would need to dispatch a large number of elites to battle against them. At that time, could they still engulf the Promise City Realm?

They all watched on with heavy hearts. Fortunately, there was still the existence of the dimension itself. This was the most powerful weapon. However, it was also because of this that they were still struggling to defeat the Promise City Realm.

In the skies, Ling Han and Yang Zhihe continued to do battle.

Ling Han was fighting in an extremely conservative manner, and this was because he was still unclear about his own strength. He needed something to compare it against.

After battling for a long time, he was finally able to make an accurate assessment of his own strength.

His ordinary battle prowess could roughly reach the peak stage of the Second Tier. After channeling his Heavenly Venerate Techniques, it would naturally increase even further. However, Heavenly Venerate Techniques varied, with each being different in might. Thus, it was difficult to say what level he would reach.

In fact, this wasn’t his full strength. However, limited by his cultivation level, he didn’t dare to unleash his full strength. Otherwise, he might accidentally kill himself before even wounding his opponent. That would be as foolish as could be.

Ling Han channeled the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll to elevate his battle prowess. He then channeled the Five Elements Lightning Technique. With his current power, he could easily channel two Heavenly Venerate Techniques.

Yang Zhihe also responded with Heavenly Venerate Techniques. However, he had only mastered a single Heavenly Venerate Technique, so he used this to launch a flurry of furious attacks at Ling Han. Even so, it was as if he were being ganged up on by two equal-level Heavenly Venerates, and this made him feel immense pressure.

Heavenly Venerates were all supreme prodigies, however, so even though Yang Zhihe was at a disadvantage, he still remained stubborn and steadfast. In fact, he unleashed brilliant attacks from time to time, threatening to turn the tables on Ling Han.

However, it was a shame that Ling Han still possessed a third Heavenly Venerate Technique. While channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he would be invincible.

Yang Zhihe was flabbergasted. Did this person’s strength have no limit? He could actually channel three Heavenly Venerate Techniques at once? Even Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would be so exhausted that they would quickly collapse, right?

What was the strength of Heavenly Venerates?

Apart from their bodies being tempered by fundamental power and their Body Arts being powerful, their other strength was their ability to wield the fundamental power of heaven and earth. It was because of this that Heavenly Venerates could genuinely channel Heavenly Venerate Techniques.

Even so, there would eventually come a point where they ran out of energy.

Ling Han’s energy consumption was far too abnormal.

As a Heavenly Venerate, Yang Zhihe naturally wouldn’t lack strong conviction and willpower. He gritted his teeth and persisted. However, following the continual depletion of his energy, he became less and less confident.

If this continued, he would eventually suffer defeat!
