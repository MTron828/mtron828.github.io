2710 Chapter 2712 Ma Feng Returns

Most of them would still continue cultivating here. After all, their goal was the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and they hadn’t succeeded yet, had they?

Besides, after being so stimulated by Ling Han, they wanted to advance to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier even more.

Actually, Ling Han did not intend to stay here any longer. He had already advanced to the Ninth Heaven, and cultivated the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique. He didn’t need any comprehension to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; he just needed to raise his cultivation level to the peak of the Ninth Heaven. Then, he would be able to directly charge towards becoming First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

All he needed was simply time, not a dangerous environment. Furthermore, to Ling Han, this place could no longer be considered a dangerous place.

He left, first to meet up with Wally and the large black dog, and then made his way back to the martial academy.

However, this time he had indeed miscalculated.

As the Martial Academy dispatched a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, it only took a few days for him to arrive at Burst Cloud Volcano, and when he learned that the crisis had been resolved, he returned to the Martial Academy at a much faster pace than Ling Han.

Had Ling Han known earlier, he would have taken the opportunity to hitch a ride.

Ling Han didn’t mind either way, though. To him, a few years was not much different from a few days.

He handed Desolate Moon over to the Martial Academy. Naturally, there would be someone to extract all the information from him regarding Hysteria, and once everything was extracted, this kind of traitor would be executed.

However, the Second Tier Heavenly Venerate did not publicize Ling Han’s battle achievements; a big shot like him naturally disdained to do so. Upon A’mu and the others return, news of it would naturally spread.

He just allowed Ling Han to record a huge merit, and even gave Ling Han a death-exemption gold medal, which would allow him to break the rules of the martial academy just once.

In fact, Ling Han didn’t care too much, for he already possessed the strength of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Once awarded the title of “Heavenly Venerate,” he would then be free from the constraints of Regulations and be detached from the world.

Ling Han stayed in the Martial Academy for a few days. Naturally, he would have matters to discuss with Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the others. He also went to see Ji Wuming and Huo Furong. After so many years had passed, these two naturally made great progress, but he had already put a very wide gap between them and himself.

However, in this great world, the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate Tier was just the beginning, whereas Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate was the real end goal.

After staying for another two days, Ling Han intended to leave.

First, he needed to make a trip to the Lin Clan, and pick up the Empress before heading to the Realm Battlefield. As for whether the Rain Emperor would be going or not, that would depend on his own desire.

Peng!

He hadn’t set off yet when the door was forcibly smashed open.

“Ling Han, get out!” A loud voice roared.

Ling Han was surprised. Ever since he went on a killing spree and slaughtered many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, everyone in the Martial Academy would address him as Senior Brother Ling whenever they saw him. Why would there be someone who would dare cause trouble at his doorstep?

He went out, only to see a young man standing at the door with a menacing look.

It was Ma Yuhai.

Ling Han was surprised. Was this guy on drugs that he would dare come to provoke him?

Ling Han couldn’t help feeling amused. He slowly walked out, and said, “Ma Yuhai, haven’t you learned your lesson yet?”

Ma Yuhai humphed. “Ling Han, don’t think of yourself as someone so impressive. Today, I will teach you how to properly behave!”

Ling Han’s eyes sharpened. Just based on Ma Yuhai’s attitude towards him, even if he was to beat him half to death, it would be guaranteed that the martial academy also wouldn’t pursue the matter.

A Heavenly Venerate couldn’t be humiliated.

Ma Yuhai was immediately startled, and quickly took three steps back, saying, “I am warning you, don’t act recklessly, as my father has returned from Realm Battlefield!”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’; it was no wonder then.

Ma Yuhai’s father, Ma Feng, was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. With the support of such an elite, Ma Yuhai would naturally have no further reservations.

Ling Han shook his head. “So that being the case, you think you can provoke me?”

“Wrong!” Ma Yuhai pointed at Ling Han. “I’m giving you a chance. If you obediently apologize to me and let me beat you up, I will not mention anything regarding our dispute. Otherwise, you leave me no choice but to ask my father to interfere.”

When it came to the last sentence, his tone was full of threat.

Ling Han was indeed impressive; he had killed Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings with his sword, and even caused a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to shed blood.

However, He Yufeng was just a newly advanced Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. In terms of strength, could he be compared with Ma Feng, a veteran elite who had been fighting in the Realm Battlefield for countless years?

Moreover, it wasn’t that He Yufeng couldn’t defeat Ling Han, but it was because Ling Han had used a powerful move which caused him to suffer a slight injury. His own strength actually surpassed Ling Han’s by many fold.

Thus, he was definitely able to make Ling Han submit.

Had it not been for the fact that there was the Lin Clan supporting Ling Han, and that his own father was merely a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, Ma Yuhai would really like to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, but nevertheless slapped him across the face. Pa, Ma Yuhai was immediately sent flying.

For the sake of Ma Feng’s many years of fighting courageously in the Realm Battlefield, Ling Han did not deliver a killing strike, leaving an heir for the Ma Clan.

Of course, if Ma Yuhai still didn’t know any better, then Ling Han would no longer be merciful. Back then, when Ma Yuhai hired Qin Shuang to kill him, it was already enough for him to be given a death sentence.

Within half a day, a message was released.

Ma Feng made an announcement, demanding that Ling Han kneel all the way to Ma Yuhai’s place by the end of today, or he would make his move.

All of a sudden, the entire martial academy was shell-shocked.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was going to deal with Ling Han!

“Sigh, Ling Han should yield.”

“That’s right. When the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate makes a move, it’s impossible to block his attack. After all, this isn’t limited by an agreement of 10 moves as it was with He Yufeng. Who will support Ling Han this time?”

“As long as it doesn’t cause any fatality, the Martial Academy will not stop a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, either. They have to give him some face as well.”

“Not necessarily. Haven’t you heard that Ling Han has defeated a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate of the Yun Clan, so even if he is to face Lord Ma Feng, he might not necessarily be at a disadvantage?”

“Hehe, you actually believe such rumors?”

“That’s right. Ling Han is only at the Eighth Heaven, how could he possibly rival the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?”

Everyone had a completely pessimistic view of Ling Han’s prospects. Even if there were one or two voices of opposition, they would still be drowned out instantly.

Naturally, Ling Han had heard about it, and shook his head; Ma Feng really doted on his son.

It was obviously impossible for him to go and apologize to Ma Yuhai; he simply ignored it completely.

One day had passed, and the sun still rose.

“Ling Han, come out!” A deep voice sounded from outside, full of intimidation.

Ling Han was just meditating and cultivating. He was still far from reaching the peak of the Ninth Heaven, so there was huge room for improvement in his strength. Every moment was very precious to him.

Hearing the voice, Ling Han stood up and came to the door.

He saw a middle-aged man standing about three meters away from the door. He was wearing black battle armor, which appeared battered with many broken parts. However, one shouldn’t underestimate this battle armor, as it was made of Divine Metal.

Battle armor made with Divine Metal had so many broken parts; what kind of battles did this person have to go through?

He was Ma Feng, who had just returned from the Realm Battlefield. The battles there would naturally be bloody. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han cupped his fists in greeting. “So it’s Brother Ma.”

Ma Feng instantly raised a brow. How dared a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King treat him as an equal? It seemed that his son did not deceive him, and this brat was indeed extremely arrogant.

“Young man, don’t be so condescending just because you think you have some talent!” Ma Feng said lightly. “I will not take it too far, and will simply break both your hands and feet, which you will not be recovering from for 100,000,000 years, so you’d better reflect upon the error of your ways.”
