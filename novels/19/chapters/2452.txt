Chapter 2453: Hui

The truth had come out, and the true culprit had appeared.

Ling Han laughed. “Then, we will have to trouble you.”

“It’s no trouble. After all, you people have also solved a large problem for me. Moreover, you guys are also the harbingers of luck for my leaving this place. In thanks for all the contribution that you have made, it is natural that I should at least allow you to die enlightened,” the white-robed man smilingly said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“You are the one who’s going to die!” Hu Niu humphed.

It looked like everything had been this man’s doing, which made her extremely angry.

Yet the white-robed man was not angered in the slightest. “Where do you guys want me to start?”

“Tell us who you are first,” Ji Wuming stated evenly. In his last life, who knew how many storms he had endured, and he had ultimately become an invincible Celestial King. Thus, he naturally had his bearing. Even faced with a more dangerous situation, he would not feel the slightest bit of panic.

The white-robed man smiled, and bowed towards them as he said, “My name is Hui, and this is a name I have bestowed on myself.”

Everyone exchanged looks. What kind of damn name was that? It didn’t even include a surname.“Please reading on Moreover, even if he did have a name and surname, who would know where had popped out from?

“Oh, actually, you guys have seen me long ago,” Hui continued.

Ling Han’s eyes set on him fixedly. After a while, he said in surprise, “This is not your real body, but a spirit form that you have manifested.”

Pa, pa, pa. Hui clapped his hands, his face bearing an expression of approval. In fact, he even gave him a thumbs-up.

This was not Hui’s real form. In fact, it was extremely possible that he wasn’t even human!

......

Everyone exchanged looks, and a thought suddenly popped up in their minds.

“You are one of those water vines!” they exclaimed at the same time.

Aside from the water vines, they really had never seen anything else… unless he was an insect, but they could probably ignore this possibility.

Hui laughed loudly. “You have guessed the most part. However, I am not one of the water vines, but rather those are my roots.”

Gasp!

Everyone was stunned. Just how long were the water vines? Everyone had a vague estimate. They could extend all the way from the depths of the ocean to the surface, so their length had to be astounding.

Every single water vine actually could be considered a colossal creature, and now to say that these were all just Hui’s roots? Then, just how gigantic did his real body have to be?

“In truth…” Hui smiled, and cast an eye over all of their faces. Only then did he state slowly, “Where you are all standing now is the inside of my real body.”

Boom, it was like countless Heaven and Earth Origin Stars had been dropped in their heads. The group was so stunned that they were dazed for a moment.

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han said grimly, “This island itself is your body!”

Hui clapped his hands. “You have guessed correctly. It was I that have forced you people all the way into my main body. You guys can continue guessing. Why have I done so?”

“Who knows why you are so insane?” Bewitching Maiden Rou immediately quipped.

Yet the Empress said, “You wanted us to fight with these insects?”

“There are really quite a number of smart people.” Hui laughed loudly. “These are parasites in my real body. Though my battle prowess is boundless, I am only a Celestial Herb, after all, so my powers are limited. Moreover, these parasites reproduce at an extremely fast rate, and after they become insects, their defense is extremely strong. Even I am helpless against them.

“Fortunately, you have helped me get rid of them. So tell me, how can I not be grateful to you?”

Huo Furong declared coldly, “Then spare the nonsense, and hand over 10 to 20 celestial fruits.”

Hui laughed loudly. “It is useless even I gave them to you. As you are people who are about to die, what need is there for me to waste my energy?”

“Is this the way you express your gratitude to your benefactors?” Ling Han asked.

Hui shook his head. “Firstly, this is a trap that I have laid, and I have not asked for your help in the first place. Secondly, the reason you people barged in was just for the Celestial Seed, and not because you wanted to help me of your own volition. Thirdly, your killing the insects was only to save yourselves as well.”

He paused, and then summarized, “Thus, I do not owe you anything. However, I have always distinguished clearly between kindness and hatred. Thus, I wish to offer my thanks to you.”

Everyone was speechless. This guy was really shameless. Furthermore, he had elevated shamelessness to a glorious degree. In that case, no matter what words they said, it would be useless against him.

As they spoke, the insects were dying by the masses. The initial sea of insects was presently only a scattered few by now, and even those powerful pincered insects were ensnared by countless whip-like shapes, torn forcefully into pieces.

With the death of the insect queen, the whole sea of insects had lost their chief commander and the support for their follow-up forces. Death was already inevitable.

Hui was even calmer. His strength was indeed shockingly powerful, and now with the internal problem resolved, it was natural that everything was within his grasp.

“You guys still have a great use,” Hui stated calmly. “I have decided to take human form and leave this place. However, due to the limits of the Celestial Path, I cannot leave… unless I can cheat the heavens!

“I need your blood essence. Not only can it help my life essence become even stronger, I will also be able to deceive this heaven and earth so that I can leave.

“Thus, allow me to thank you again.”

Hui bowed again. Though he spoke very politely, it only made Ling Han and the others even more furious.

“Do you have that kind of power?” Dongfang Rui humphed coldly. He was the son of a Heavenly Venerate, and now someone actually said they were going to extract his blood essence. This Celestial Herb had to be completely ignorant, and did not know how terrifying a Heavenly Venerate could be. Otherwise, the moment he left the Celestial Path, he would be erased by the Heavenly Venerate.

…To actually dare make a move on the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate, wasn’t that just courting death?

Hui scoffed, and said, “Could it be that you guys have not witnessed my strength?”

When his words fell, thousands of whip-like shapes immediately assailed.

Every single whip-like shape was equivalent to an insect, and this number was also earth-shattering, in no way inferior to the sea of insects. Furthermore, they had already undergone a bloody battle, so how much battle prowess did they have left by now?

Thankfully, Hui was just flexing his muscles, and did not truly attack them.

At present, he was like an upstart that had just discovered a supreme treasure trove, so impatient to share his joy with others. Thus, even if Ling Han and the others would soon be killed by him, he was like a chatterbox.

“A few epochs ago, I suddenly gained intelligence, and matured bit by bit.” Hui narrated his tale. “It is really, really difficult for plants to succeed Dao. Even so, after so many years, my mentality has just barely matured.

“The essence of plants is beloved by the heaven and earth, but the moment they gain intelligence, they would be despised by the heaven and earth, causing parasites to emerge in my body, and I could get no peace.

“Thankfully, they are finally dealt with now.”

Hui revealed a menacing grin. “All right then. I have decided to kill all of you, and leave this godforsaken place. As for your reward, I will try my best to be quicker so that you will only have to suffer the least amount of pain possible.”

Everyone was grim. They would have to fight another tough battle.

Yet Ling Han raised his right hand. “I still have two Heaven and Earth Origin Stars on me. This is what had killed the insect queen previously. Do you want to give them a try?”

Everyone was immediately overjoyed. As it turned out, Ling Han had kept something back.

Good!

Wonderful!

“Don’t kill me! Don’t hurt me!” Hui exclaimed in a very exaggerated fashion, and even wrapped his arms around himself, shivering. However, he immediately broke into involuntary laughter. “I am really unsuited to acting!”

He crossed his arms behind his back. “Just make your move if you like. This can’t kill me at all. At most, I will only suffer a slight injury.

“Today, your only path will be death!” he said word by word.
