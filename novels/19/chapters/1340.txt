1341 Uncle, are you very good at fighting?

Ling Han smiled slightly, and asked, “Is this enough to prove that your father and I know each other?”

The young girl in red was mischievous and circled around Ling Han one more time, and then asked, “Where are you from, and why are you looking for Father? Is it because you can no longer carry on where you are originally from?”

“If that’s what you think.” Ling Han was naturally not going to drop down to the level of his grand-disciple. He was still feeling rueful. Whichever angle he looked at it from, his young and handsome self wasn’t at all reminiscent of a patriarch (grandmaster). nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Do you dislike talking?” The young girl was unwilling to let him off. “How do you know my Father?”

“Hehe.” Ling Han merely smiled, and did not answer. He realized that this girl was a little bit of a pest.

“Come with me.” The girl blinked her eyes, and mischief flashed through her gaze.

Ling Han saw this, yet was completely uncaring. At present, his abilities were enough to suppress the entire Heaven’s Sword Palace, and in the face of absolute sword intent, no matter how many tricks this girl played, it would be meaningless.

The girl turned around and led the way, whilst Ling Han followed behind.

“Er, I say, Uncle, are you any good at fighting?” the young girl asked with slight anticipation.

“I should be quite capable.” Ling Han did not pretend to be modest, as that was indeed the truth.

“Hehe, you were the one who said it.” A mischievous smile flashed over the young girl’s face as she led Ling Han to stand in front of a courtyard. She obviously did not have any good intentions, as she immediately shot out a foot in a kick. Bang, the two big doors were forcibly kicked open by her foot.

Obviously, the quarters of disciples of the Heaven’s Sword Palace were not protected by a formation. Otherwise, even if she had been in the Mountain River Tier, it would not have been easy to kick the doors open, either.

Ling Han knew that this young girl was planning to use him as cannon fodder.

He did not take it to heart, though. In the first place, the reason why he had come to the Heaven’s Sword Palace was to cause great trouble and disband this sect. There was nothing wrong with starting from this step. Furthermore, if he made enough of a commotion, Jiang Yuefeng naturally would appear as well.

“Jiang Qiaoling, it’s you again!” An angry shout was heard from inside the courtyard, and seven people practically rushed out at the same time, all of them looking fierce and demonic.

Jiang Qiaoling was naturally the name of the girl in red—Jiang Yuefeng’s daughter.

She pretended to be stunned, and immediately dodged to hide behind Ling Han. Then, she stuck out her head, and said, “Do you all want to bully me? Humph, this is my uncle, and he’s extremely good at fighting!”

“Hahaha!” When the seven people looked at Ling Han, they all laughed loudly, appearing to be completely disdainful and uncaring.

Ling Han had curbed his aura, and from mere appearances, he looked extremely ordinary. If one were to say he looked handsome, what use was that to seven men? Moreover, he was not the type that was earth-shatteringly handsome, either. Jiang Yuefeng, on the other hand, was a top-grade beauty, or he would not have managed to steal the heart of a noble daughter of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, either.

“Uncle, look, these people are looking down on you. Didn’t you say you were quite good at fighting? Teach them a lesson!” Jiang Qiaoling fanned the fires of both sides, and called Ling Han ‘uncle’ without the slightest care.

One of the seven people, a man wearing a red headscarf, said, “Jiang Qiaoling, Young Master Ling really likes you. Furthermore, the two of you are well-matched. One is the descendant of Great Ancestor Yang, whereas the other is the descendant of Great Ancestor Ling, so the two of you are definitely a match made in heaven!”

“Please, Ling Yuefeng is who knows how many years older than me. Previously, he liked my mother and wanted to marry her, and now he likes and wants to marry me. Yo, just the mere thought of it gives me goosebumps, so disgusting!” Jiang Qiaoling crossed her arms over her chest, looking incredibly disgusted.

“Even if I have to marry someone, I would rather marry this uncle!” She still did not forget to pull some hostility over to Ling Han. It was definitely deliberate.

“And who are you?” the Red Headscarf asked Ling Han.

“My surname is Ni, and my name is Yeye,” Ling Han said carelessly[1].

When he said this, Jiang Qiaoling suddenly spluttered in laughter. She covered her mouth with one hand and was shaking with laughter.

The Red Headscarf’s brain was not as fast as Jiang Qiaoling’s. He mumbled ‘Ni Yeye’ a few times before he heard the person next to him point out, “Brother Bao, he’s taking advantage of you and calling himself your grandfather!”

“F***!” The Red Headscarf immediately jumped up and glared at Ling Han. “Are you tired of living already? You even dare to take advantage of me.”

“Oh, are you very strong?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“Not strong, not strong in the slightest!” Jiang Qiaoling hurriedly said. “He is just a dog of Ling Yuefeng, in the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier— oh right, Uncle, you couldn’t possibly be unable to defeat even this kind of trash, right?”

“What if I can’t?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

“Then you’d be in big trouble because I have only just advanced into the Mountain River Tier, and would not be able to save you at all!” Jiang Qiaoling stuck out her tongue. “You had better protect your face as much as possible, I trust they would not dare beat you to death.”

This... she indeed was Jiang Yuefeng’s daughter—the first thing she thought of in a fight was protecting her face.

Speechless, Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I do not have the habit of being beaten.”

“What a coincidence, neither do I. Looks like we’re quire suited for each other!” Jiang Qiaoling elbowed Ling Han.

“Humph, then I’ll just choose your face to hit!” The Red Headscarf took the initiative to step out, aiming a fist right at Ling Han’s face.

Ling Han’s feet moved, and this fist immediately missed. Then, he lightly used his leg in a hooking motion, and pa, the Red Headscarf immediately stumbled onto the ground.

He had used strength very intelligently in this movement, making use of the force the Red Headscarf used in punching, transforming it into the force of his impact on the ground. With the heavy crash, the Red Headscarf landed solidly and dramatically on the ground.

“Brother Bao!” The other six people hurriedly went to help the Red Headscarf up. It could be seen that this guy’s whole face was covered in blood and dirt. As it turned out, he had actually broken his two front teeth on a hard rock when he had landed on the ground.

Firstly, this was because the impact was too strong, and secondly, it was because he had not channeled any Origin Power to protect himself. Otherwise, he would not have been so miserable.

“Yo, you had your face smacked now!” Jiang Qiaoling immediately started clapping, then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Uncle, you’re so awesome!”

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “It has nothing to do with me. I didn’t hit anyone.”

The Red Headscarf and his companions were in a rage. You called this having nothing to do with you? If you had not stretched out your leg to trip him, would the Red Headscarf end up like this?

“We attack together!” Humiliated, the Red Headscarf was in a rage, and with a wave of his hand, he took the lead to charge towards Ling Han.

All seven of them were fierce, and did not become wary of Ling Han due to how the Red Headscarf had eaten a loss just now. In their eyes, it was the Red Headscarf himself who had been too careless, and that was why Ling Han managed to trip him up, resulting in him breaking two of his front teeth.

Jiang Qiaoling was very good at fanning the fires, and it was naturally impossible for her to involve herself in this. She quickly broke into a run, calling out, “Uncle, go! Go!”

Shua, shua, shua. Fists, palm strikes, Sword Qi, Saber Qi. There were some who used fists and palm strikes, and others used sabers or swords among the seven people, and they attacked him from all sides.

Ling Han crossed his arms behind his back, his feet moving, handling the seven people’s attacks with ease and skill. Not only that, he had even deliberately guided the seven of them to attack one another through movements.

Suddenly, the seven shouted and quarrelled, appearing incredibly chaotic.
