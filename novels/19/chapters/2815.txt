2816 Tricked

It was Ping Xinghai that was the leader, so Ling Han naturally was considered to be one of Ping Xinghai’s people.

The black-robed Fourth Tier looked menacingly at Ping Xinghai, and stretched out his hand, but he was aiming for Ling Han.

“Let’s charge together, guys. Rush past these doors, and the Heavenly Venerable Seal and supreme secret technique is waiting for us!” Ling Han shouted, but he was rapidly retreating himself.

The giant hand descended, but Ling Han had rapidly retreated, causing a great many people to be caught in the range of this blow.

There was no one who would be willing to just surrender, and added with the fact that the actions of these three Fourth Tiers had long since caused public outrage, everyone had already been mentally prepared to fight when they had stood together, so when they saw that the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate had attacked first, there were people that instantly moved to counterattack.

With one leading the way, this instantly caused a chain reaction, and even more people moved to attack.

Peng, peng, peng! A battle royale immediately erupted.

“Humph, you people truly are reckless!” The other two Fourth Tiers looked towards Ping Xinghai menacingly. This had to have been deliberately planned by this boy, and his purpose was to create chaos so that he could sneak in.

Otherwise, a First Tier Heavenly Venerate would not even be able to pass through the aura field that they had set up. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Though Fourth Tiers had an overwhelming advantage, these three Fourth Tiers did not dare to really start a massacre. After all, there were a great many people here who were backed by people that could stand as their equals, or even surpassed them.

The treasure had not appeared now, so there really was no reason to offend these people just for this.

Hence, the remaining two Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates had set their eyes on Ping Xinghai. To catch bandits, capture the ringleader—as long as they captured this person who had led the others to cause trouble, the others naturally would return to being a pile of scattered sand.

Shua, shua! The two great Fourth Tier elites moved at the same time, grabbing towards Ping Xinghai.

Ping Xinghai felt extremely wronged. Though he had gathered the others to force the three great elites to step aside, he did not have the slightest intention of sparking off a battle. That was because he knew very well that it would be useless even if all of them joined forces. It was absolutely impossible that they would be able to match these three Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

But now? Two Fourth Tier elites were actually attacking him simultaneously, causing him to be “overwhelmed by the flattery and honor.”

Why had things played out in this way?

Xiu! Right at this moment, a figure streaked out, leaping towards that revolving light door.

“Humph!” Though the two Fourth Tiers had made their move against Ping Xinghai, how could it be that a noble, dignified Fourth Tier would need to go all out just to deal with a Third Tier? One of the Fourth Tiers stretched out his other hand to strike that figure, appearing extremely disdainful.

This was just a mere First Tier.

Peng!

However, he had miscalculated. Faced with this strike, that First Tier Heavenly Venerate did not dodge, but rather clenched a fist and countered his strike.

‘You are seeking death,’ the Fourth Tier thought. Taking on the attack of a Fourth Tier head-on, even if he did not die, it would still cause severe injury.

But in the next instant, his eyes bulged widely.

That man actually managed to parry this strike from him!

Though he had not used full power in this attack, it had still reached the Third Tier. Wouldn’t suppressing a mere First Tier be a piece of cake?

Yet Ping Xinghai immediately called out, “L-Ling Han!”

He had not recognized Ling Han, but what other First Tier could match the might of a Third Tier?

Ping Xinghai had been tricked!

Realization immediately dawned on him; he had fallen for Ling Han’s evil trap.

This guy had done so many things, and his purpose was to instigate everyone to create an opening for him so that he could sneak in during the chaos and enter the palace.

‘Damn it, damn it!’

Ping Xinghai almost spluttered out a mouthful of blood. Previously, Ling Han had killed three of his lackeys, and now he was actually shouting a battle cry for his sake, creating a chance for him. Just how stupid was he?

“Damn it!” Those two Fourth Tiers were furious. They had only taken one misstep, and now the whole game was lost. They had not thought that Ling Han was the real person who had been planning to sneak in under the cover of chaos, and he was actually hiding so deeply, being a First Tier Heavenly Venerate that actually had the strength of Third Tier.

They both glared furiously at Ping Xinghai. This had to be one of the main culprits as well. Otherwise, why would he have so earnestly “served” Ling Han?

Peng!

The attacks of the duo landed. When a Fourth Tier moved, much less when two combined their attacks, how was a Third Tier supposed to block that?

Ping Xinghai was instantly suppressed with a single strike.

Pu!

Ping Xinghai had still thrown up a mouthful of blood ultimately. His resentment overflowed. Just thinking of Ling Han appearing in front of him, he could eat Ling Han alive!

He really felt very wronged playing the fool for him.

***

Xiu! Ling Han had already rushed into the light door. Led by a mysterious energy, he appeared in a plain. There were damaged suits of armor scattered everywhere and corpses lying here and there, exuding an air of war and battle.

A flag was stuck into the ground. There was no symbol on it, but only a few words, “Never step back.”

Never step back?

These were heroic words, but faced with powerful enemies, just how many people could live up to the words “never stepping back”? Moreover, retreat was also a kind of tactic. Whether it was a battle between two people, or a large-scale war, retreat was always an option.

Ling Han had not even finished the thought when he saw that a large massive army had appeared ahead of him.

Their numbers were stunning, as great as millions, and all of them exuded an aura that reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Even if these were all First Tier Heavenly Venerates, even a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate would have to avoid them under the crushing force of millions of them.

‘Never step back? Impossible!’

Ling Han nodded. No wonder even three Fourth Tier elites had not been able to pass this kind of test. Taking even a single step back would probably be considered failing. But the problem here was: who would be able not to retreat with an army of millions charging towards him?

“Hahaha!” Ling Han erupted into loud laughter, and charged forwards.

Peng! He was like a lion that pounced into a flock of lambs, charging right into the main force of the enemy troops. Brandishing both fists, he instantly sent over 100 powerful enemies flying.

Faced with Ling Han, a First Tier was completely outmatched.

Peng, peng, peng! With a punch, powerful foes were blasted into nothing one after another, and the imagery was extraordinarily realistic. There were blood spraying and corpses collapsing here and there, exuding an intense chill.

...

However, Ling Han knew that all this had to be only an illusion. If a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate could really create such a great army of Heavenly Venerates, wouldn’t this world be completely chaotic?

White Tiger symbolized slaughter, so the test here was a test of slaughter.

If so, he would just kill to his heart’s content.

Ling Han’s black locks fluttered wildly as he unleashed a massacre.

However, though his strength reached the Third Tier, he still couldn’t hold up to the fact that the number of Heavenly Venerates here was really too great, so he had still taken a few blows, causing him to throw up blood and break bones.

However, as Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he maintained his battle prowess. His hands balled into fists, and he unleashed Fists of Fury.

This was just the right opportunity to use these countless Heavenly Venerates to temper his supreme Fist Intent.

Ling Han was the type to be more motivated the greater the pressure on him was. Every time he sustained injury, his motivation would increase slightly, and comprehension dawned on him continuously, endlessly unfurling in his mind.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and felt a great sense of satisfaction and a pleasure he could not describe.

So what if he was wounded? What cultivator would not suffer injury?

Time passed endlessly. One year, 10 years, 100 years… but there was never a pause to the battle. More and more troops appeared, wanting to drown Ling Han completely.

...

These enemies only had the aura of Heavenly Venerates, but their strength was truly limited. Otherwise, even Ling Han would not dare go so crazy, not taking one step back even when faced with millions of First Tier Heavenly Venerates.

But it seemed like this kind of battle would never end, and even one with the strongest and most resolute willpower would begin to falter.

Yet Ling Han enjoyed this. He treated this battle as the best way to temper his fist technique, completely forgetting his intention for entering into this place.

He forged onwards bravely, not taking even half a step back.
