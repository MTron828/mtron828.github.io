2856 Competing with Bao Fengyu again

This time, Ling Han was not playing around with Bao Fengyu. He really was slightly tired, and needed to rest.

Of course, it was not impossible for him to forcefully proceed, but why did he have to do that?

In any case, the raw stones would not be going anywhere, and the two people who were waiting for a beating had already stretched themselves out, so it was fine to keep the two of them hanging.

There was no inn here. When Ling Han and his group left, they just found a random spot, and then entered into the Spatial Celestial Tool. Naturally, they would be able to get a good rest.

Of course, if this was in the wild, they would have to be careful, and guard against the sudden palm strike from a Heavenly Venerate. If that happened, a Spatial Celestial Tool would not be able to block it.

Ling Han wanted to use a great volume of Devouring Metal to forge a spatial container just like the Black Tower. That really would be considered well fortified, and even a Heavenly Venerate would have to expend a great deal of effort to be able to open it.

It was very difficult in the past. After all, there was too little Devouring Metal available, and Ling Han had to depend on Devouring Metal to be able to take that last final step. However, when this primitive dimension was discovered, it did not seem like it would be anything too hard to find another piece of Devouring Metal.

Never mind this for now.

Ling Han rested well. Using his “brain” too much was indeed tiring.

A day later, they came out of the Celestial Guest Residence, and returned to the raw stone lane of yesterday.

Hey, why were there so many people?

Though there had been many spectators yesterday, there had only been around 100 of them, but what was going on today? To say nothing of 100,000 or 80,0001, there were definitely 30,000 to 40,000 people here. Even if this raw stone lane was very big, there was still a feeling of being stuffed to the brim.

This was because two grandmasters of raw stone were going to compete in stone gambling, which naturally caused a great commotion.

Ling Han had achieved fame in a fell swoop, defeating Niu Buqun by unearthing two Heavenly Venerable Seals in a row. This was definitely not due to luck. Furthermore, Bao Fengyu was even more famous. He was the respected guest of a great many high-level Heavenly Venerates, and it was not clear how many people wanted to befriend him.

And now, two grandmasters of raw stone had made an agreement for stone gambling, and it was a weird gamble at that, which was naturally an even greater gimmick, which people flocked towards.

Ling Han scratched his head. If he had known earlier, he would not have decided to compete here. Wasn’t this just free publicity for this raw stone lane?

Never mind. In any case, this raw stone lane did not belong to the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate, after all.

“Ling Han, you really dared to come,” Bao Fengyu said coldly. He had endured for a whole day, and he really was displeased to the extreme now. He couldn’t be bothered to put on his usual act of being approachable and friendly anymore.

Ling Han was surprised. “Why would I not? I am a great Heavenly Venerate, and you are but a mere Ninth Heaven. How could it be that I would be scared of you? You are disrespecting a Heavenly Venerate, so be careful that I don’t skin you for that!”

Bao Fengyu’s expression changed drastically.

The present world situation had spoiled grandmasters of raw stone to be arrogant and willful, but everyone knew that there ultimately would come a day when raw stones would be mined completely. At that time, the so-called grandmasters of raw stone would just be trash.

In the past, they had strutted around proudly in front of Heavenly Venerates, forcing them to smile and speak to them. Did one really think that Heavenly Venerates had no temper?

Heavenly Venerates were those that even the heavens had to respect, so how could disrespect be condoned?

Once the time came, it was definite that a great number of raw stone grandmasters would be called to an accounting, and they would suffer a tragic end.

But it could not be helped; being flattered in this manner by Heavenly Venerates, how could one not swell up with pride?

For example, Bao Fengyu’s natural talent in cultivation was actually average, and he had just barely made it into the Celestial King Tier. Originally, he should have just attained the First Heaven at most, but who would have imagined that he would be extremely talented in stone gambling? This gave him a new lease on life.

Hence, with the great number of treasures poured on him, he was forcefully pushed to the heights of the Ninth Heaven.

Of course, Heavenly Venerable Tier was not something that could be attained by forceful pushing; this really was the final destination of his boundless lifetime.

But going from the First Heaven to Ninth Heaven was already an incredibly astonishing leap. Everything was due to his ability in stone gambling, so how could he not be proud? How could his ego not get greater and greater? How could his airs not become bigger as time passed?

And now, these words from Ling Han seemed to have shattered the false words that he had used to numb himself, and clearly show that he was only a Ninth Heaven, while the former was a lofty Heavenly Venerate.

Bao Fengyu’s expression was livid, and his heart grew resentful. So what if Ling Han was a Heavenly Venerate? Bao Fengyu might not be able to reach Heavenly Venerable Tier, but he could make Heavenly Venerates lower their heads, or even kneel down and kowtow to him!

“Spare the nonsense, and begin the competition,” he shouted at Ling Han.

Ling Han set his eyes on this man. Had the present grandmasters of raw stone really been spoiled rotten? Fine then, he would strike a blow to these people’s pride today.

They entered the high-grade area of this raw stone lane. The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate was already standing by here. His expression was not friendly. He had accumulated a whole day of anger, and this was a little harsh on him.

“Everyone is limited to taking three pieces. Agreed?” Bao Fengyu asked Ling Han.

“Sure.” Ling Han nodded. The raw stones in this high-grade area were truly expensive. At the very least, they would have to be bought with the blood of Heavenly Venerates. There were around 100 of them in total. The smallest was only the size of a fist, while the largest was more than three meters tall.

But the similarity was that every raw stone was covered with a dense network of veiled patterns, and there was a mysterious design about them, as if they themselves were Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Of course, this was only a misconception. The high-grade area could also produce scrap stones, but, relatively speaking, the number was much smaller, and the chance of unearthing something valuable was considerably higher as well.

“The time limit is one day,” Bao Fengyu continued.

“Okay,” Ling Han agreed casually. He really didn’t care.

The two of them did not speak further, and began their selection of raw stones.

“I really had not imagined that Ling Han would really be so amazing to actually be competing with Grandmaster Bao.”

“What Grandmaster Bao? There was one thing that Ling Han did not say wrong. He is a mere Ninth Heaven, capable of discerning a few stones, and he dares to act superior in front of a Heavenly Venerate?”

“That’s right. He must have been spoiled by others.”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“As expected, Ling Han is a real troublemaker. This is truly impressive!”

“Humph, it’s about time to deliver a harsh strike to the pride of those so-called grandmasters of raw stone so that they can recognize who they are and what their true status is.”

“But did you guys notice something? In the past, the grandmasters of raw stone were all Celestial Kings, and not one of them was a Heavenly Venerate.”

“Yi, now that you’re saying it, that really is the case.”

“It seems like there is a unique power that has prevented a Heavenly Venerate from becoming a grandmaster of raw stone.”

“Up until now…”

Everyone looked towards Ling Han. He really was a freak. He was the first to achieve this—a Heavenly Venerate was also able to become a grandmaster of raw stone.

“This is like a curse. Heavenly Venerates can get no reaction from Heavenly Venerable Stones.”

“It should be the power of heaven and earth that is messing around, right?”

“It may also be that the fundamental powers of the Genesis World are incompatible with Heavenly Venerable Stones.”

Everyone began to wonder, and made their deductions. It was not clear who had guessed some part of it, but it was also possible that all of them were wrong.

Setting them aside, Ling Han walked slowly, stretching out his hands to lay them on the raw stones. With the level of his proficiency now, he really just had to touch them with his hand, and the contents of the raw stone would appear completely in his mind’s eye.

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod. The chances of treasure were really high in the high-grade area, but it was not definite that the possibility of truly valuable treasure being unearthed would be higher than the mid-grade area, or even the low-grade area. At least, he had not encountered a single Heavenly Venerable Seal up till now.

There were few raw stones here, so he would have to move faster, and grab those raw stones that he thought were excellent. However, because the gamble was going to be decided based on three raw stones, the number of raw stones he could grasp could not exceed three.

If there were more than three, he would have to replace those extra ones he had picked out. Otherwise, if he took all the raw stones, what would his opponent do?

After touching around 20 of them, Ling Han finally picked his first one. There was a Great Herb inside here; it was a green-colored Great Herb, and was extremely old.

He picked through over a dozen more pieces, and Ling Han chose his second piece. This was another Great Herb, but it was green in color.

Just when he was about to make a whole circle around the 100 stones, Ling Han touched a raw stone, and a hint of shock involuntarily showed in his expression.
