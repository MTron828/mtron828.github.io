Chapter 3443: Half an ancient character

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The fire dragon approached, and the Ninth Prince didn’t dodge or evade.

Instead, he directly charged over.

Boom, the fiery flames swept past, and the skin on his body turned crimson red. It was obvious that he had been burnt, but he did not feel it at all. He continued to charge towards Luo Jintang like a mad bull, wanting to knock down his opponent in the most barbaric manner.

Ling Han was also slightly surprised. Just how terrifying had this guy cultivated his physique to? Even high-level flames were unable to damage

him?

“His body has fused with Deep Sea Black Iron, and it itself is extremely cold. To a great extent, it has resolved the weakness of being afraid of fire,” Eldest Baby commented.

Fourth Baby said disdainfully, “If I spray out a flame, I guarantee that he won’t be able to withstand it!”

“Yes!” The Calabash Brothers nodded in agreement.

They were both born with a Divine Physique, so the flames that Fourth Baby spat out naturally far surpassed ordinary high-level energy.

Luo Jintang retreated continuously, completely unable to fight back. Seeing this scene, everyone became excited, and they all waved and cheered.

As expected of the son of the Holy Emperor, one of the top ten Imperial Princes. He was too awesome.

However, Ling Han wasn’t very optimistic about the Ninth Prince. This was because Luo Jintang was far too calm and composed. It was clear that he was only dodging and not attacking because he didn’t understand the Ninth Prince’s Mystical Power. However, things couldn’t go on like this forever.

Sure enough, after a few dozen moves, Luo Jintang smiled and suddenly launched a counterattack.

Peng! The Ninth Prince instantly stumbled and almost fell to the ground.

What was going on?

Everyone’s cheers immediately stopped. It seemed like there were signs of a comeback.

The Ninth Prince steadied his footing, and looked towards Luo Jintang. He frowned and said, “I weigh more than 500,000 kg, and after channelling mystical power and increasing my weight by another hundred times, you are actually capable of affecting me?”

Pu!

Quite a few people spluttered in shock. Over 500,000 kilograms? Are you even human?

However, Ling Han wasn’t surprised. The Ninth Prince had fused with the Deep Sea Black Iron, so it could be said that the bones in his body had already been replaced by the Deep Sea Black Iron. Furthermore, the density of the Deep Sea Black Iron was astonishingly high. Because it was constantly under the water pressure of the deep sea, and after hundreds or even thousands of years, it was naturally compressed to an incredibly solid extent.

Theoretically speaking, it was impossible for humans to obtain Deep Sea Black Iron. This was because no one could reach the bottom of the sea at such a deep depth. However, the heaven and earth itself had changed, causing the sea to become fields and plains. Only then could the Deep Sea Black Iron appear.

The strange thing was that Luo Jintang was actually capable of affecting the balance of the Ninth Prince, and that was what was shocking. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Luo Jintang smiled faintly, and said, “If I truly want to push Your Imperial Highness, the difficulty level would naturally be higher. However, with the help of Your Imperial Highness’s own power, it would not be too difficult.” Ling Han immediately came to a realization upon hearing this. This was because Luo Jintang had grasped the rhythm of the Ninth Prince’s heartbeat. Thus, he could affect the Ninth Prince with a very small amount of power.

This was the so-called ability to turn the tables. It was also a kind of Frequency Attack.

Ling Han couldn’t help but turn to look at Luo Jintang. This was the first person he had seen that could use Frequency Attack to attack, which made him feel slightly curious, and also gave rise to the thought of sparring with him.

The Ninth Prince pondered for a moment before saying, “It’s quite impressive that you were able to come up with a plan to deal with me in such a short amount of time.”

■■Thank you for your praise, Your Imperial Highness.” Luo Jintang bowed slightly, appearing very modest.

“But you want to defeat me just like that? You’re far too naive!” the Ninth Prince said as he charged forward again.

Luo Jintang was already confident in himself. When the Ninth Prince neared, he stretched out a hand and pushed him aside. He used just the right amount of force. Pa, the Ninth Prince stumbled again, and his offensive instantly vanished. He himself appeared to be in quite a sorry state.

He did not rush to attack, and merely watched quietly.

In truth, the Ninth Prince’s bones were forged from Deep Sea Black Iron, causing his defenses to become incredibly tough. Even if he suffered a few punches or palm strikes, he would still be completely fine. Thus, Luo Jintang simply chose not to attack directly, and merely allowed the Ninth Prince himself to fall in an incredibly sorry state.

Meanwhile, Ling Han stroked his chin. Faced with the Ninth Prince’s defenses, how was he supposed to deal with him?

Frequency Attack was effective.

As long as he continued to use Frequency Attack with a consistent frequency, even the sturdiest object would be destroyed.

Theoretically speaking, even Divine Metal and Metal Element Godly metal would crumble one day in the face of Frequency Attack. However, this would take a very, very long time, so long that Ling Han wouldn’t be able to see the end of it even if he died of old age. Additionally, if Frequency Attacks were launched against Frequency Attacks, one’s own fists would also need to be struck, and it was more likely that one’s own fists would be destroyed first.

With the strength of the Ninth Prince’s physique, it would take a very long time for him to be wounded, or even killed.

Thus, for the sake of efficiency, it was best to use the Heavenly Pattern Jade. Shooting out an object as heavy as 5,000kg at nine times the speed of sound, even if the Ninth Prince’s whole body was forged from Deep Sea Black Iron, it would be useless. A hole would definitely be created in a single strike, or he could even be shattered into pieces.

As he pondered, the Ninth Prince stumbled repeatedly.

Luo Jintang had discovered his weakness, and he would always trip and fall at the drop of a hat. He couldn’t even get close to Luo Jintang, so how was he supposed to win?

Even if his physique was tough, and if he fell like this, he would not have to worry for the moment, at least, but he was still a great Imperial Prince, so how humiliating would it be for him to continuously put up a performance of falling flat on the ground?

The Ninth Prince roared in fury as he lunged forward again.

Luo Jintang used the same trick again, and sent out another palm strike, wanting to make the Ninth Prince fall again. However, he had just stretched out his hand, when he gave a muffled humph, and saw that there was actually traces of blood on his fist.

He frowned. He clearly hadn’t seen the Ninth Prince make a move, so why was he injured?

Otherwise, no matter how the Ninth Prince raised his hand, raised his leg, or even spat out an attack from his mouth, he would still be on guard and not be hit.

Boom! The Ninth Prince’s fist flew over, and Luo Jintang hurriedly retreated.

He understood.

Luo Jintang nodded in understanding. This was an attack that the Ninth Prince had launched at him through the opening of his acupuncture points. Thus, there was no need for him to raise his hand or raise his foot. Mystical power would shoot out from his acupuncture points, and his attacks would become unfathomable.

Was this cheating?

Only those who had reached the Enlightenment Tier could open the acupuncture points on their bodies. However, the Ninth Prince had still suppressed his power, and was still within the range of Inscription Tier. “Jintang, continue fighting.” The old man beside him suddenly spoke up. Luo Jintang nodded. So what if he used the power of Enlightenment Tier? He would only treat it like another Mystical Power of his opponent. He was invincible among his peers, so what did he have to fear?

“Die!” He finally became serious, and divine light exuded from his eyes. His entire aura was completely different.

A golden bell once again appeared on his body, but this time, it was boosted with half of an ancient character. It was clearly only half, but it was exuding an incredibly majestic aura, as if the whole world had to bow its head to him.

The Ninth Prince’s punch arrived, yet Luo Jintang didn’t dodge or evade. Instead, he clashed with him head-on.

Peng!

Their fists collided, and the golden bell shuddered slightly. However, the Ninth Prince didn’t absorb any more of its power.

Luo Jintang roared again, and launched a fierce counterattack. Peng, peng, peng! He swung his fists repeatedly, pouring out attacks at the Ninth Prince. This kind of battle style was most to the Ninth Prince’s liking. He laughed loudly, and clashed head-on with the other without dodging at all.

However, after several dozen strikes, the Ninth Prince’s expression changed drastically. Blood was seeping from his arms..
