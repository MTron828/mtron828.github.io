Chapter 2570: Niu Er

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After several hundred exchanges, Sima Qing collapsed helplessly.

He wanted to flee, but did not succeed. At present, Ling Han had already formed his own path. In terms of Intent Realm, he had attained a height that was higher than even that of a considerable number of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. As long as they were weaker than him in strength, there was no way anyone could escape from him.

The Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls lay silently on the ground. Even if it was not in an awakened state presently, it still gave off a frightening amount of pressure. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ling Han wanted to pick it up, but his hand hadn’t even touched it when the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls lit up by itself. Seals flickered, exuding the divine might that belonged to the Ninth Heaven.

Without anyone wielding it, the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls had become even more terrifying instead.

Ling Han sighed. With his present strength, it was still not enough to refine Ninth Heaven Celestial Tools. Otherwise, if he tried to force it, it would not be the Divine Demon Sword refining the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls, but rather he would be obliterated by the Halberd of Ten Thousand Ghouls.

Too bad; it was rare to find a Celestial Tool.

Ling Han felt very depressed, and this was apparent in his expression.

F***, after winning such a difficult battle, he actually had that kind of expression?

He was really asking to be beaten.

A great number of spectators thought that Ling Han was showing off, but when they thought about it, if anyone were to possess such strength, they would be qualified to show off, wouldn’t they?

After this battle, Ling Han had really gained a name for himself.

Wielding a Celestial Tool and being one cultivation level higher, yet still being unable to suppress Ling Han. Just how strong was this man?

“To snipe Li Long, and prevent him from reaching the summit, looks like a Blood Martial King has to be deployed.”

“It would be doubtful if it was an ordinary Blood Martial King. No matter what, it has to be a Blood Martial King with more than 20 wins, right?”

“20 wins! Do you think 20 wins are an easy feat? 20 wins of a Blood Martial King are completely won from other Blood Martial Kings. Furthermore, repeatedly defeating the same opponent is not counted, what more when defeat would mean having the number of wins reduced.”

“En, probably only a Blood Martial King with seven or eight wins would be mobilized at most.”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly, beginning to talk about Ling Han’s next opponent. Who exactly was there that would be able to stop Ling Han from becoming a new Blood Martial King?

This battle was really too glorious. Even Tang Yuan was extremely excited. He once again hosted a celebratory banquet for Ling Han. Subsequently, as long as Ling Han won two more times, he would be able to become a Blood Martial King.

Very soon, Tang Yuan would be able to seek Lu Li out for revenge. Just the thought of it made him excited.

The ninth match came even later. After a whole three months, Ling Han’s opponent was finally confirmed. Then, the tournament advertised it far and wide, attracting countless people.

Even a single ticket was hard to come by, and this was clear proof of how much attention this match had garnered.

However, no one revealed who this new opponent of Ling Han would be. Even Tang Yuan had not been able to find out. It could only be revealed when the time came.

With Tang Yuan leading, the group arrived at the tournament ground. As an exception, Tang Yuan went first to the lobby backstage, cheering Ling Han on. He was filled with anticipation that he would see another great victory later.

When the time had come, Tang Yuan was requested to leave. Even he, a spoiled young master, would not dare to interrupt the progress of the tournament.

Ling Han went up the stage, waiting quietly for his opponent to appear.

As usual, the commentator made introductions for Ling Han, spit flying everywhere in his excitement. Everyone gave him face by cheering excitedly, but very soon, after the thrill had passed, they all began to anticipate the appearance of Ling Han’s opponent.

Who was this opponent? Everyone really wanted to know.

“And now, everyone must very much anticipate Li Long’s opponent, right?” The commentator paused, and looked here and there. When he saw that everyone bore expressions of impatience, he finally revealed the answer.

“Perhaps, everyone has already guessed; it is a Blood Martial King!”

This was indeed as everyone had expected, but they still cheered. Furthermore, their anticipation increased even further. Just who exactly would this Blood Martial King be?

“And he is…

“…Niu Er!”

This was a very funny?name1, but not only did everyone not laugh, they erupted into booming cheers instead.

“Niu Er, the prodigy of the Herculean Iron Bull Race. Over a million years ago, he has already become a Blood Martial King, and now has already attained 32 wins.” The commentator was also speaking earnestly, and listed out Niu Er’s victorious records.

These naturally were the battles that he had gone through after becoming a Blood Martial King. 32 wins was not a great number, and he had only obtained such an achievement in over a million years, which made it seem like his battle prowess was nothing impressive.

But this was not the case.

These victories were pure victories. It meant that his chance of victory against other Blood Martial Kings was more than 50%! More importantly, he enjoyed a battle without any reservations at all. Thus, it was very rare that he would be fighting in the tournament grounds. Otherwise, his victories would far surpass this number.

This time, the tournament authorities had also paid a very great price to get him to come back, snipe Ling Han, and prevent him from reaching the top.

“…Now let us, with the most intense applause, welcome our Blood Martial King warrior, Niu Er!”

Hua, the cheering was world-shaking. Most of the spectators here were Celestial Kings, and they were roaring and howling loudly at the same time. This scene was incredibly grand.

Niu Er appeared.

Ling Han looked over, and couldn’t help but wear a strange expression.

His opponent was a man of incredibly sturdy build. He was three meters tall, but only his body was human-like. He had the head of a bull, and his hands were also the hooves of a bull, while a long bull’s tail grew from his behind. He was completely jet-black all over.

The difference was that there was only a single bull’s horn growing from his head, and not two.

Just as the commentator had previously introduced, this was not a member of the human race, but a foreign race. It was just that he had now assumed humanoid form.

Niu Er strode forwards, a great hatchet in his grip. This was not a Celestial Tool, but was rather something forged from Pseudo-Divine Metal. It was adequate in sharpness and sturdiness, allowing him to consecutively battle for several hundred years before he would need to repair it.

“Scram!” Niu Er raised his blade, and pointed it at the commentator. “Or I will slaughter you.”

The commentator did not even dare to speak, and immediately shut up obediently.

“So you are the man that recent gossip has been spreading around so much about?” Niu Er withdrew the blade, and looked towards Ling Han, his eyes fierce and harsh. “However, you are far from being as tall and ferocious as I have imagined.”

Meanwhile, Ling Han was looking Niu Er up and down, his gaze blazing.

“Brat, what are you looking at me like that for?” Niu Er asked, displeased.

Smiling, Ling Han replied, “Just to see which part of you is suitable to make into grilled skewers, and which part would be suitable for braising or steaming.”

Niu Er was instantly fuming with fury. This human Celestial Qi actually dared to treat him like an animal waiting to be slaughtered?

‘I am a member of the Herculean Iron Bull Race, not a buffalo!’

“Damnable brat, I will kill you!” Niu Er roared loudly. He brandished his hatchet, and sliced down in a hacking motion at Ling Han while leaping towards him.

Peng!

A loud sound rang out, and a massive pit appeared on the ground. Dust was flying everywhere. Niu Er withdrew his blade, his eyes looking for where Ling Han had moved. “You did not disappoint me, and do have some strength after all.”

Ling Han had already retreated 300 meters away, which just happened to be the limit of this massive pit. If he had taken a step less, even if it was just half an inch, he would have lost his footing.

Niu Er bared his mouth in a grin, but he was no longer careless inwardly. It was nothing strange that Ling Han had managed to dodge this strike. More importantly, the distance that he had retreated was too accurate, as if he was extremely familiar with Niu Er’s power.

It was only their first meeting, but Ling Han could react in this way. This kind of insight was truly frightening.

This kind of opponent definitely could not be underestimated.

“For a beef skewer, you talk too much,” Ling Han retorted, smiling. With a tap of his foot, he charged towards Niu Er.

“You human brat!” Niu Er was so furious that his nostrils were practically smoking. This brat was really treating him as food?

He roared loudly, and struck out towards Ling Han, brandishing the large blade.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

To have such a great reputation of ferocity, and having even been invited by the tournament authorities to snipe Ling Han, Niu Er’s strength was amazing. The light of the blade was shocking. If it was not for the fact that there were powerful restrictions in place here, all the stars in the skies would probably be swept down to the ground with the Saber Qi.
