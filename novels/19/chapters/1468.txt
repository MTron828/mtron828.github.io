Chapter 1469 Unable to Achieve Victory!

“Spar?” Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. He shook his head, and said, “If it’s genuine sparring, I welcome it at any time. However, it’s a shame that you people aren’t here to simply spar. It’s clear that you’re trying to exert dominance and take us down a notch.

“Let us battle! Enough with the nonsense. If you’re unable to achieve victory against me, then please go and obediently crawl through that dog flap as well!”

Anger involuntarily flared across Yi Gaoning’s face. Ling Han wanted him to crawl through the dog flap?

He was an Eternal River Tier elite! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even on Wood Figure Planet, where there were 10 Saints, Eternal River Tier cultivators could still be regarded as elites. These were powerful cultivators who commanded respect and reverence from everyone.

Yet, Ling Han actually wanted an Eternal River Tier elite to crawl through a dog flap? Was he trying to cause an uprising?

“I’ve seen many audacious people. However, you...” Yi Gaoning shook his head, and continued, “Junior Brother Ling, your talent is indeed incredible. However, you have to understand that this is the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. Here, there is no shortage of prodigies!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, appearing as wanton as could be. “That’s because you’ve never come across me before!” He was radiating with pride as he said this, and his astonishing aura was so powerful that it could convince all those who heard his words.

Yi Gaoning was also affected by his aura. He faltered momentarily before a dark expression spread across his face. “Then let us battle!”

There was regret in his mind. Why had he accepted this task? If he had known that there would be such a powerful troublemaker, would he still have fought so hard for this task? What could he do now? Not only had he come across a troublemaker, but this troublemaker was even a profoundly powerful freak.

“Destruction of a Thousand Dao!” He slapped his own body.

Weng!

Specks of incredibly bright light pulsated inside his body.

This was a formation eye!

The Tranquil Heart Saint had succeeded his Dao through formations, and he had more so achieved this by using his own body as a formation. Every single bone in his body was a formation eye, and his body itself was more so a large killing formation!

Numerous golden sabers materialized around Yi Gaoning, all of them brimming with a murderous aura that soared into the skies.

Upon seeing this, a speculation formed in Ling Han’s mind.

Back in the Lower Realm, Ma Duo Bao had been born as a killing formation—the First Killing Formation had been engraved inside his body. Moreover, the Third Killing Formation had also been a person. Perhaps this wasn’t the doing of the heavens, but instead a bloodline inheritance as well?

For example, if Yi Gaoning was powerful enough, the formation patterns engraved on his bones could be passed down onto his descendants. Of course, this inheritance naturally wouldn’t be a complete inheritance. However, just a portion of its power would be sufficiently powerful enough to be regarded as the First Killing Formation or Third Killing Formation if it were placed in a small world.

Ling Han already knew that bloodlines were created when a powerful ancestor fused their Dao into their body. It was because of this that their bloodline could be passed down through future generations. That being the case, why couldn’t formations be passed down?

Weng!

Just as his thoughts were running wild, Yi Gaoning had already lashed out. Several hundred golden sabers shot toward Ling Han.

Ling Han forcefully charged toward them, not trying to evade at all.

‘Are you seeking death?’

Yi Gaoning couldn’t help but sneer. He conceded that Ling Han’s technique just then had indeed been astonishing. Ling Han had blocked his attack using a technique that even he couldn’t understand. However, he had only launched a casual attack just then. Now, however, he was attacking with his full power. Yet, Ling Han was still charging over without a care in the world? Was he seeking death?

‘I’ll grant you your wish!’

Yi Gaoning circulated his formation and fused it together with his battle prowess. He then pushed his attack to the extreme as the sabers blasted toward Ling Han.

He naturally wouldn’t kill this new disciple. Taking them down a notch was just that, but if he killed a new disciple, he would definitely have to pay with his own life. No one would be exempt from this punishment. However, it was unavoidable that Ling Han would suffer shattered bones and other severe wounds.

The golden sabers arrived before Ling Han.

Ding, ding, ding!

There was a series of crisp rings, and it was as if these were real God Tools, not weapons that had been formed from Origin Power and Spiritual Qi. However, what did this matter? The golden sabers were all deflected aside as they struck Ling Han’s body. It was as if he weren’t being attacked by an Eternal River Tier elite, but instead by some random weakling.

‘How is this possible?’ Yi Gaoning was unable to accept this. ‘What kind of f*cking defensive armor are you wearing? How is it so freakish? It can easily withstand my full-power attack?!’

However, he could clearly see that there was no glowing divine pattern on Ling Han’s body. If he were using a God Tool, there was no way that it could be so subtle.

‘Perhaps... it’s his physique? Gasp!’

Indeed, Ling Han’s physique had already surpassed the toughness of Level 13 Godly metal. However, just this alone still wouldn’t be enough to withstand the attack of a king tier at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. More importantly, Ling Han had actively channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. This had allowed his defenses to reach an astonishing level for a short period of time.

In fact, he could have even withstood the attack of a Saint!

That being the case, how could Yi Gaoning’s attack have wounded him?

After launching his most powerful attack, his defenses were naturally at their most fragile state.

Peng!

Ling Han launched a punch that smashed into Yi Gaoning’s face. Yi Gaoning was instantly sent flying. He crashed into a gate before bouncing back off, his arms and legs spread wide open as he collapsed onto the ground.

Everyone grimaced upon seeing this.

Were these new disciples trying to defy the heavens?

Was Yi Gaoning powerful? He was undoubtedly powerful! However, Ling Han had defeated him in a single strike!

In fact, if Yi Gaoning had been prepared, he could have engaged in a long skirmish with Ling Han. That way, even if Ling Han had eventually won, it would have taken him at least several hundred, several thousand, or even tens of thousands of exchanges. However, how could Yi Gaoning have known that Ling Han possessed such a freakish physique? After a single violent exchange, he was instantly sent sprawling.

“Brilliant!” The seven new disciples couldn’t help but exclaim in delight. They naturally didn’t want to crawl through the dog flap. They were king tiers, so how could they be willing to suffer such humiliation? Thus, they were all exhilarated upon seeing Ling Han resist and fight back, even gaining an upper hand.

After witnessing this, they could accept it even if a more powerful senior disciple eventually appeared and forced them to crawl through the dog flap.

They had fought back! And they had even slapped the face of a senior disciple!

Yi Gaoning slowly picked himself up. In the instant that Ling Han had struck him, he had used his Origin Power to guard his own face. Thus, even though he had been sent flying, he hadn’t suffered any severe wounds.

After all, he was an elite at the late stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Moreover, he was also a king tier!

His face was beet red as he glowered at Ling Han. He had actually lost to a new disciple! There were more so flames of rage and menace flickering in his eyes. He had been slapped before so many people! How utterly humiliating!

If he didn’t exact revenge, how could he face anyone in the future?

“Just you wait!” However, Yi Gaoning didn’t choose to continue his battle with Ling Han. He was afraid that he would be humiliated even further. He was going to seek help from more powerful seniors and ask them to suppress Ling Han!

Rules were rules. To say nothing of Ling Han, even the current Saints had been forced to crawl through these dog flaps when they had first arrived at the academy!

Ling Han would be dreaming if he wanted to become the first exception. Doing so would be opposing the entire Star Sand Martial Arts Academy! He was destined to fail!

“Humph! Trying to leave?” Ling Han said with a cold chuckle. ‘What a joke, you tried to force me into crawling through this dog flap even though I didn’t provoke you in any way. Yet, after being defeated by me, you’re trying to pat yourself off and leave? Do you think it’s that easy?’

“Perhaps you want me to stay?” Yi Gaoning asked. He couldn’t help but chuckle.

“I don’t want you to stay, I’ll force you to stay!” Killing intent radiated from Ling Han’s body. “I already said it just then. If you lose to me, then please go and obediently crawl through that dog flap!”

“In your dreams!” Yi Gaoning said with a cold chuckle. Looking back at history, there had never been a shortage of troublemakers. Among them, there had also been some supremely talented individuals. However, in the end, which of them hadn’t been suppressed by a more powerful senior? There was no helping this. The gulf between their cultivation levels was far too large, so how could they withstand the might of their seniors?

If a king tier at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier couldn’t suppress Ling Han, then what about a king tier at the medium extreme? Or the high extreme? Or perhaps even the consummate level?
