Chapter 1450 Saber of Heaven“s Will

Gu Daoyi was indescribably stunned. The God of Blood Finger was an ultimate technique he had cultivated in his second lifetime. Used as an attack, with Ling Han’s superficial mastery of the power of time, it was absolutely impossible for him to dispel the attack.

This was indeed as he had expected, but could it be that this guy’s body was forged from Divine Metal?

Even Gu Daoyi could not imagine how there could possibly be such a freakish physique in this world, causing him to involuntarily be stirred up emotionally and pale.

“F***, I must have seen it wrong, right?”

“That brat suffered such a terrifying attack from Gu Daoyi, and he didn’t even have the slightest scratch on him?”

“No, no, no, he has still been wounded.”

“Bullsh*t, that’s only a little bleeding from the corner of his mouth; can that also be considered a wound?”

The masses below were all grabbing their heads. Gu Daoyi couldn’t cause him serious injury even when he used a supreme technique; what level had Ling Han’s physique reached?

Ling Han wiped away the trace of blood at the corner of his lips. He was Gu Daoyi, after all. Even if his cultivation level had been reduced, this attack had still induced a certain amount of damage to him. After all, the toughness of his physique had also been weakened along with his cultivation level.

But this kind of wound was completely nothing. With a flick of his finger, innumerable flashes of Sword Qi danced, and struck out at Gu Daoyi.

Lightning Sword Technique!

Shua, shua, shua. Every flash of Sword Qi was incredibly and extraordinarily fast, and they caused Gu Daoyi to suddenly cut a sorry figure. He parried endlessly, but after these flashes of Sword Qi dispersed, multiple rips had appeared on his clothing as well. Some of his hair had also been cut, and there was even a wound on his cheek, from which blood was seeping.

Gu Daoyi had also been injured!

Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t help but gasp, and Gu Daoyi’s followers were incredibly furious. They wanted nothing more than to fly up into the air, and grind Ling Han into dust. In their hearts, Gu Daoyi was a god that could only be worshipped.

That was Gu Daoyi, the person who was acclaimed to be strongest prodigy for all eternity, but now in a situation when their cultivation levels were completely equal, he had actually sustained an injury.

You attacked and I countered, neither willing to take a loss.

Gasp, Ling Han was also very strong!

At this moment, there was finally a number of people that leant towards Ling Han. Even if they did not think that he could win, he was qualified to oppose Gu Daoyi at least, and was the strongest king tier of the present younger generation.

Gu Daoyi wiped his cheek. HIs blood congealed and did not change. Each drop was like a bead. He looked at the trace of blood on his hand, his expression becoming colder and colder. He had re-cultivated eight lifetimes when he had fallen from the Celestial Realm into this Immortal Realm. He had successfully reached the peak of Genesis Tier in every lifetime, and had not suffered the slightest setback. How many years had it been since the last time he had been injured?

He had buried his body of nine lifetimes, and only became a Divine Fetus in his 10th lifetime. Furthermore, he was cultivating a cultivation technique of the Celestial Realm, so no matter how he thought about it, he should have been invincible among his peers. Even in the Celestial Realm, he was still confident that only prodigies of the same cultivation level could match him at most, but if it was a matter of defeating him, that was an absolute impossibility.

But as it happened, in this Immortal Realm that he thought of as a primitive plane, there appeared a person who could match him, and the other party had not even cultivated to his third pinnacle level. In theory, in terms of power and the use of Regulations, the latter was slightly less skilled than himself.

Then didn’t that completely mean that he would lose in a battle between equals?

No!

Gu Daoyi looked once more at Ling Han, and communicated through his divine sense. “I used my body of nine lifetimes to cultivate the Divine Fetus of my 10th lifetime. I cultivated supreme Mystical Powers in every lifetime; how many Mystical Powers from how many lifetimes would you be capable of blocking?”

“Bring it on!” Ling Han laughed loudly. His hands flourished, and one after another, flashes of Sword Qi shot out and sliced towards Gu Daoyi.

He was also very conceited. Since Gu Daoyi was not using any weapons, he also put the Divine Demon Sword away.

“Heaven’s Will Saber!” Gu Daoyi’s expression suddenly became serious, his whole person exuding a cold saber intent as if he himself had become a supreme divine saber that could slash apart all in existence.

Ling Han’s face bore a smile, but a powerful feeling of alertness rose up in his heart.

Those like Empress Luan Xing and Faceless, if they were traced back to their origins, were all related to the Celestial Realm. They were descendants of elites from the Celestial Realm, and the blood of the Celestial Realm flowed in their bodies, so they could use the techniques of the Celestial Realm.

But compared to Gu Daoyi, they were still far too inferior.

He himself was an elite of the Celestial Realm. He had only buried himself and lived one lifetime after another. With every lifetime, he would change his bloodline once and cultivate a new Mystical Power. Though Ling Han was not sure about the theory, it was likely related to the Nine Deaths Heaven Art.

This was a living elite of the Celestial Realm. He had only had his cultivation level weakened, but his foundations were even deeper, and his constitution was incredibly strong.

The secret techniques that he used definitely could not be underestimated.

The truth was indeed so as well. A supreme divine saber appeared above Gu Daoyi’s head. It was 30,000 meters long and as black as ink. The mere sight of it would cause one’s heart and soul to tremble as if their spirit itself would be plucked out of their body. Gu Daoyi’s Heaven’s Will Saber meant that when the heavens delivered a saber strike on you, the damage was not done to the physical body, but rather to your spirit!

“All life fades!” Gu Daoyi pointed a finger at Ling Han. Shua, the divine saber slashed over, representing the great dao of heaven and earth, and could not be blocked by anything in existence.

Ling Han used the Tide of the Ages, but in a clash of celestial techniques, the Tide of the Ages was not able to produce much effect. This divine saber had only been weakened by 30%, and was still slashing down at him with its massive aura and might.

This was very normal. Celestial techniques were invincible in the Immortal Realm, but in the Celestial Realm, there definitely would be innumerable ways of opposing them. Otherwise, wouldn’t the Ding Clan have been able to conquer and rule over the whole Celestial Realm?

Boom, the saber struck down, and inconceivably, the saber’s blade that was still over 20,000 meters long actually sliced into Ling Han’s body, and then disappeared without a trace.

This was not a material attack, but rather divine intent. It was naturally formless, and the damage was directly dealt to the spirit.

“Haha!” Gu Daoyi laughed loudly. After being slashed by the Heaven’s Will Saber, it was natural that not the slightest bit would be left of his spirit, as it would all be destroyed. From now onwards, there would no longer be a person called Ling Han in this world.

He felt a slight pity. In his eyes, Ling Han should also be from the Celestial Realm. Even if he had not come directly from the Celestial Realm like himself, he should at least be a descendant of those that had been expelled from the Celestial Realm those years ago, and they could be claimed to share the same roots.

If possible, he actually wanted very much to take Ling Han in under his banner as one of his followers to witness the supreme hegemony he would establish when he entered into the Celestial Realm one day.

Because they were both exiles, this kind of acknowledgement would give him more pleasure.

The others did not understand, however. How could such a powerful saber strike deliver such a tranquil attack?

“That is a saber that slices the spirit. It looks incredibly colossal, but actually has no true form. Naturally, it would not cause much of a commotion.” A powerful figure spoke up to explain. That was a representative sent from the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, an elite of Eternal River Tier.

When these words were said, everyone was stunned. It should be known that even in the Immortal Realm, most people were basically cultivating the strength of their physical body, and though they would still cultivate their spirit, it was only primarily in the direction of strengthening the latter so that the strength of one’s spirit would keep up with one’s cultivation level. However, they would not deliberately be cultivating the intensity thereof.

Which also meant that if they had encountered Gu Daoyi, it was possible that even if 100 of them joined forces, it would still be useless. When the Heaven’s Will Saber struck, all of them would become empty shells.

“Sigh, that guy is indeed very extraordinary as well, and he has actually been killed just like this.”

“There is one less supreme king tier!”

“What a real pity.”

“Yi, that’s not right! If this guy had died, shouldn’t the floating rock beneath his feet have been absorbed by Gu Daoyi?” someone suddenly exclaimed.

Gasp!

Everyone’s eyes had widened, and they once again focused their eyes on Ling Han. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

F***, don’t you tell them that this guy still hadn’t died.
