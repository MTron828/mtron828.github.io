Chapter 1815: Heavenly Dao Jade

“What Heavenly Dao Jade?” Ling Han hurriedly asked.

Small Tower paused slightly, and then said, “The Heavenly Dao Source Rock developed over countless years, turning into a treasured jade, also known as the Foundation Jade, Remedy Jade. If one refines it in the Severing Mundane Tier, it can make up for all the regrets that one has experienced before in the path of cultivation, and allow to reach perfection.”

Ling Han was stunned, and asked, “You mean even if they did not advance by striking the heaven and earth, they could also forcefully change that via the Heavenly Dao Jade?”

“That’s right.” Small Tower swayed; this was its version of a nod. “You don’t have to think that it is unjust. The Heavenly Dao Source Rock is formed by the Source Power of Earth, and has to go through countless years of change to be able to turn into a jade. Only one could probably appear every few epochs in the whole Celestial Realm.”

Only one would appear in a few epochs; that was even rarer than the Reincarnation Tree.

Anything that involved Source Power was extremely awesome, wasn’t it?

Ling Han nodded, but did not place too much importance on it. He had cultivated each cultivation level to perfection. Thus, even if the Heavenly Dao Jade fell into the hands of another, it would only allow them to be capable of becoming his equal.

However, he still possessed such Source Powers of the heaven and earth like the Xuanyin Source Water and Nine Heavens Flame, as well as an amazing technique like the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Even if someone could cultivate to perfection, there was no need for him to be afraid, either.

Just take Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun for example: hadn’t they, too, cultivated each cultivation level to perfection? But so what?

‘Wait, that’s not right!’

If that was the case, then why had Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng come?

They had both cultivated each cultivation level to perfection, and there was nothing that they had to make up for.

Small Tower humphed, and retorted, “The Heavenly Dao Jade has another use, and that is if you have cultivated all your cultivation levels to absolute perfection, then it can possibly grant you a sliver of a chance to attain a fifth severance!”

“What!?” Ling Han was really shocked now.

Fifth severance, an achievement that even countless Celestial Kings could only admire. According to the large black dog, only if one had achieved the fifth severance would he be qualified to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King or a Heavenly Venerable Tier.

To be honest, though Ling Han had only achieved two severances, he felt that the difficulty level had soared innumerable times over with every strike he delivered, and third severance had already pushed him to his limits. Fourth severance was definitely his limit; no matter what, there was no way he could deliver the fifth strike.

But now, the Heavenly Dao Jade had a sliver of a chance of helping him deliver the fifth strike. This was astounding.

Fifth severance, to say nothing of surpassing all Celestial Kings, but there was definitely no problem of surpassing 99% of them.

And going by that, the Heavenly Dao Jade’s value instantly soared countless times over. If it was not for the fact that this thing could only be refined in the Severing Mundane Tier, it was guaranteed that every Celestial King would definitely fight madly over it.

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder the descendants of two Celestial King Tier forces had appeared. If they had come for the sake of achieving the fifth severance, then it was understandable.

“Strange, why had those two Celestial Kings not taken it early on?” he mused.

“The development of the Heavenly Dao Source Rock requires very strict conditions. Since it is suited to the environment of this place, it naturally could not be taken from here. Otherwise, it would only be unfinished, and not possess the slightest bit of value,” Small Tower explained.

Ling Han nodded. This was one of the reasons. Additionally, it was possible that the two great Celestial Kings had not wanted to spark a war with each other. In any case, it was something that would only be useful for their descendants, so they’d just let the descendants compete with one another for it. They should not always think of asking for the help of their elders.

“Can you sense the location of the Heavenly Dao Jade?” Ling Han asked, slightly expectant.

“Of course!” Small Tower was very proud.

Ling Han was immediately delighted. Previously, it was definitely Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng that had taken the lead. They knew what their goal was and where it was, but now? At least he would not be at a disadvantage.

‘Then let’s have a fair competition.’

Ling Han gripped the Empress’s hand lightly, and said, “Let’s go.”

As they walked, he explained about the Heavenly Dao Jade to the Empress, and then asked Small Tower, “How many people can refine the Heavenly Dao Jade?”

Small Tower pondered. “That would have to depend on its size, but it is best not to exceed two people.”

Though Ling Han felt it was a bit of a pity, the Heavenly Dao Jade was such a precious item, so it would be truly illogical if it could be refined by many people.

Hopefully this precious jade was big enough so that both he and the Empress could make use of it.

“Lead the way,” Ling Han said.

“It is contained on this mountain. Work hard on searching for it. If you obtain it, you are lucky, but if not, then it was meant to be,” Small Tower said, putting on a pretense of mystery.

Ling Han scoffed, “You probably don’t know the exact location, either, right?”

This little thing, if it did not know, it could have just said so. It still had to act so proudly.

“...At present, I can only sense the existence of the Heavenly Dao Jade. Only if I come close enough will I be able to confirm its exact location.” This time, Small Tower did not become angered from being embarrassed.

Ling Han nodded. Since that was the case, they would just have to set off to search for it.

The two of them set out. Behind them, Bewitching Maiden Rou hesitated slightly, but still followed them. And with her following them, Beiyu Xiong and the others immediately followed as well. Who asked the Empress to be so unapproachable, while the other beauty would always be smiling and lacked any airs?

Luo Changfeng smirked coldly. These pieces of trash thought that they were worthy of competing with him over the Heavenly Dao Jade? Just wait, he would first find the Heavenly Dao Jade, then come back, and take the beauty for himself. He was sure that his identity as the Holy Son of a Celestial King Tier sect would be enough to rob Ling Han of his wife.

Zihe Bingyun did not delay much longer, either, and set out on her own.

She was the same as Luo Changfeng. They both clearly knew what they were looking for. Merely this fact was a boundless advantage over the others.

Ling Han turned to look, and his expression involuntarily became strange. Had this Bewitching Maiden Rou gotten addicted to tailing them?

He shook his head. In any case, he hadn’t found the location of the Heavenly Dao Jade yet, so he did not mind bringing so many people running around all over the mountain and wilderness.

This was a grassy mountain densely covered with trees. Furthermore, the majority of them were very normal, and they weren’t especially tall. In fact, there were a few that were indescribably short.

The forest was not very silent. Occasionally, some deer could be seen popping their heads out of the foliage in curiosity. Upon spotting Ling Han and the Empress, they would break into a run and gallop off.

Rustle, rustle. The bushes ahead of them suddenly began to move.

Ling Han held the Empress’s slender hand, and the two of them stopped. The bushes moved, and were presently coming closer to where they stood.

What could it be? Wild beasts?

Hua, the bushes separated, and a person suddenly leaped out. Yet he was extremely short, only about just over a foot tall. This was a male, but definitely no child, because he had a beard, and his face was indescribably aged.

“Halt!” he shouted, and then another dwarf jumped out.

“Halt!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Halt!”

“Halt!”

One after another, a total of seven dwarves leaped out. They each wielded a black staff that was only a foot long. In the hands of an ordinary person, that would be a short rod, but in the hands of these seven people, they were like walking canes that they had to hold with both hands, and they were all pointed at Ling Han and the Empress.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “All right, I’ll halt. What next?”

The seven dwarves looked at one another, and said, “Who are you people? Why have you come to this place?”

“Could it be that they are the so-called Giant Race? Just look at them, they are all so tall, so ugly!” a dwarf said.

“They indeed look very ugly.”

“They did not commit suicide even with how ugly they look; I really admire their courage!”

“I never want to go to the outside world; all of them are hideous!”

These dwarves looked positively horrified.
