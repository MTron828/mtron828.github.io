Chapter 1442 Gathering of King Tiers

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “I still have some companions here. We can fill up an extra eight spots.”

“Eight?!” the Stone Emperor exclaimed in slight astonishment. They couldn’t fill their team with inferior cultivators! At the very least, these had to be rank two king tiers.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Yes, eight.”

“Brother Ling, not to offend you, but are you sure that apart from you and the Rain Emperor these other people won’t be a burden?” the North Emperor asked with a serious expression.

“I’m sure!” Ling Han replied with a nod. Regardless of whether it was his two disciples or Xu Ran, which of them wasn’t a rank two king tier? In fact, Empress Luan Xing was more so a rank three king tier. As for the Notionless Saint... Well, he was a Saint!

If he unleashed his aura, that would be enough to petrify a good portion of people. Seizing this opportunity to attack, they would definitely be able to achieve brilliant results.

Only the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was slightly weaker. However, as a rank one king tier, she wouldn’t be too much of a burden.

“Alright!” the Stone Emperor said with a nod. “Then we’ll go and search for two more team members.”

“No problem!” Ling Han said with a nod.

In fact, he could also introduce two more team members. For example, Yue Ying and Yang Lin, king tiers from the Long Light Galaxy. At that time, he had also developed a good relationship with them. However, this was the Stone Emperor and North Emperor’s suggestion, after all, so it would be rude for him to make all the decisions.

“When will the Sunken Abyss Valley open?” the Rain Emperor asked.

“It won’t be too long. Apparently, the rock faces of the Sunken Abyss Valley are already starting to glow. When this glow becomes as bright as the sun, that will be the moment when the valley opens,” the North Emperor replied.

“Then we’ll patiently wait for you two,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Mm-hm!” The Stone Emperor and North Emperor took their leave. They had to find the remaining two team members as soon as possible.

After they left, Ling Han specially traveled to the Sunken Abyss Valley. Sure enough, just as the Stone Emperor and North Emperor had said, there was nothing special about this valley. There were rocks everywhere, and there wasn’t any plant, beast, or insect in view. This was a completely desolate and lifeless valley.

Now, however, the rock faces of the valley were glowing, just that this glow wasn’t very bright. In fact, this glow could barely be seen in the morning. Only when night fell would this soft glow become obvious.

However, this changed extremely quickly, with the glow becoming visible in the morning after just seven days’ time. At this rate, it was safe to assume that this glow would become as bright as the sun in another 10 days’ time.

Ling Han returned to his residence. After a few days, he saw the Stone Emperor and North Emperor return, another two men behind them. These men possessed mighty auras, and their demeanor was as if they were the center of the universe. One couldn’t help but cast their gaze over.

However, these two men were truly haughty, this haughtiness not only in appearance, but also from the depths of their very being.

“Here, let me introduce them,” the North Emperor said with a smile. “This here is Nie Tiancheng, Brother Nie. He’s the youngest out of the Flying Rain Saint’s 18 disciples. However, his talent is the most outstanding.”

Nie Tiancheng smiled, this smile appearing relatively amicable. However, the arrogance and haughtiness that radiated from him could be sensed from a good 10 kilometers away.

“This here is Shan Jingyi, Brother Shan,” the North Emperor said as he pointed at the other man. “Brother Shan is a disciple of the Six Mountains Saint.”

Shan Jingyi also nodded at Ling Han, his expression still as haughty as could be.

These two king tiers were truly full of themselves.

“Where are the others?” Shan Jingyi asked. “Didn’t you say that there are already 12 members?” There was a look of impatience on his face.

Of course he was displeased. Shouldn’t these people have finished preparing long ago? Once they arrived, it should have been time for them to all set off. So, why was Ling Han the only one here? Where were the others? He actually had to wait for these remaining people? Humph! How arrogant!

“Brother Ling, we’ve filled up all 12 spots of our team now, and the opening of the Sunken Abyss Valley is also imminent. So, gather the others, and we’ll immediately set off,” the North Emperor said with a smile.

“Understood!” Ling Han said with a nod. Glancing at Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi, he had a feeling that these two individuals were far too haughty. He was sure that their haughtiness would eventually become poisonous tumor to their team.

In fact, after learning of the Sunken Abyss Valley’s existence, the Rain Emperor and the others hadn’t gone out to challenge any other king tiers. Thus, the seven of them arrived in the guest hall in no time after receiving news of the others’ arrival.

“Huh?!”

Upon seeing Empress Luan Xing, Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi both exclaimed in surprise and adoration.

Although they couldn’t see her features, just her figure and aura alone were enough to enchant them and tug at their heartstrings. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This was definitely a breathtaking beauty.

Their haughtiness suddenly disappeared, and they both actively stepped forward to introduce themselves.

“I’m Shan Jingyi!”

“I’m Nie Tiancheng!”

To say nothing of them, even the Stone Emperor and North Emperor were stunned by her beauty. However, as Ling Han’s good friends, they naturally couldn’t act so brazenly. Thus, they didn’t step forward to introduce themselves.

Who was Empress Luan Xing?

In terms of pride, who could compare to her?

She completely ignored Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi, having eyes only for Ling Han.

This caused Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi to feel even more displeased with Ling Han. There was a peculiar glimmer in the eyes, and it was a mystery what they were pondering over or planning to do.

“Let’s go.”

The 12 of them set off for the Sunken Abyss Valley.

Ling Han’s residence was quite far from the Sunken Abyss Valley, so even though they were king tiers at the Heavenly Body Tier, they would still need to walk for an entire two days if they didn’t travel at full speed. However, there was no need for them to hurry, as they still had plenty of time until the valley opened. Thus, they only arrived at their destination after walking for two days.

At this time, the Sunken Abyss Valley was already overflowing with people.

This type of rare opportunity would only come about once every several million years, after all. Moreover, this valley would suppress their cultivation level and even allow them to form teams. With these factors, even rank three king tiers wouldn’t possess an overwhelming advantage. Thus, who wouldn’t travel here to test their luck out?

If they obtained the great opportunity of this valley, perhaps they would be able to transform their life and destiny! A prodigy might become a king tier, and a king tier might become a king among kings!

Gazing around, the valley was already packed full of people.

Right now, the entire valley was radiating with a soft glow that was clearly brilliant, yet not piercing to the eyes.

“This will definitely be an intense and cutthroat competition!” everyone exclaimed with emotion.

This competition could be viewed as the prelude to the recruitment competition of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. In fact, the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy would also send people over to observe the competition. This was both to prevent mishaps and to keep an eye out for any outstanding individuals. After all, talent was only an intangible asset, while strength and battle prowess were the true qualities of king tiers.

Although not every king tier would participate in this competition, at least 90% of them definitely would.

If one hadn’t reached or surpassed the Heavenly Body Tier, they would have no option but to sit aside and spectate the competition. This valley would only suppress one’s cultivation level, not raise one’s cultivation level. As such, if one were at the Sun Moon Tier, they would still remain at the Sun Moon Tier even if they entered the valley. In that case, they would be nothing more than cannon fodder.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the sea of cultivators, and after searching for a long time, he finally found the king tiers from the Long Light Galaxy. Right now, all of them were standing together.

As mentioned before, when casting one’s eyes over the entire universe, those who were from the same galaxy would naturally feel closer to each other. This was especially the case for weaker galaxies like the Long Light Galaxy. This galaxy had only produced a mere three king tiers.

Afterward, Ling Han also saw Faceless. However, he was located too far away, so Ling Han didn’t walk over to say hi to him.

Then, he also saw... Gu Daoyi!

In the entire Immortal Realm, Ling Han was most likely the first person to have learned of Gu Daoyi’s existence. However, he had only heard his voice at the time, and hadn’t actually seen him in person. Right now, he was finally able to see him. He wasn’t difficult to find. In fact, he was incredibly easy to find as he was like a crane among a bunch of chickens. There was an empty region of at least 30 meters around him, and a circle of people was standing around him, their eyes fervent with excitement.

Gu Daoyi wasn’t extremely handsome, yet his skin was as smooth as jade and his hair was jet-black like ink. His aura was indescribably elegant and ethereal.

This was a Divine Fetus!
