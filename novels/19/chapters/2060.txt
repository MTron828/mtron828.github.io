Chapter 2061: Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes

Though this was a trick, it could still be considered a very good strategy.

Because as long as they won, they would be rewarded, so what need was there for them to fight to the death? This was a complete waste of time, wasn’t it?

Ling Han laughed and nodded. If it could save some trouble, he, too, had no intention to fight intensely with others.

The purple-robed young man couldn’t help but feel overjoyed, and asked, “Brother, you also think this is a good idea, right?”

“What’s your name?” Ling Han asked him.

“Brother, my name is Bo Luo[1],” the purple-robed young man replied eagerly.

“Pineapple?” Hu Niu was immediately infuriated. “You are not edible, and you actually dare call yourself Pineapple[2]?”

Bo Luo felt very aggrieved. It was not he who wanted to be given this name. Who asked him to be born in the Bo Clan, and his grandfather just happened to bestow on him the name “Luo” as his given name? However, he did not dare talk back to Hu Niu, and said, “Sister-in-law is right! Sister-in-law has lectured me right!”

Hearing him address her as sister-in-law, Hu Niu was immediately all smiles. She felt that even though this “pineapple” could not be eaten, he was quite a nice guy still.

She patted Bo Luo’s shoulder, and said, “Not bad, lad. You have good awareness!”

Hearing her call Bo Luo as lad in such a mature tone, the people in the area all could not help but laugh. This little girl’s flame of life had clearly not been burning for as long as Bo Luo’s, yet she considered herself as an elder. There really wasn’t anyone else like that.

“Yes, yes, yes.” Bao Luo nodded nonstop, looking completely like a lackey.

Ling Han was also smiling slightly. Laughing, he said, “All right. I have decided to join this alliance. Which of you is the leader? You help us register, and then we can find a clan to join together.”

“Got it!” Bo Luo replied.

Ling Han and his group opened a door in the wall, and entered for a rest first.

They had obtained a large number of Dragon Crystals on their journey, and Ling Han had also gotten a considerable number of Blooms of Dao, which he could share with Hu Niu and the Empress. As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, he had completely forgotten about her. However, when it was really time to “share the spoils”, Bewitching Maiden Rou would naturally approach shamelessly, and would practically snatch a few Blooms of Dao from his hands.

They settled down temporarily, firstly to wait for the arrival of the others, and secondly to wait for the contest between the seven clans to begin.

At first, Ling Han had thought the contest between the seven great clans was for a spar to take place among the outsiders that each clan had respectively recruited, and whichever side won would naturally be the final victor, but reality was not so simple.

They had to enter a region, and the Dragon Pearls that the seven clans had to collect were contained within. Every 100,000,000 years, only a single Dragon Pearl would be born.

Why did they have to recruit outsiders?

That was because only outsiders could enter into this region.

Even the townspeople of Azure Dragon Town did not know exactly what kind of situation they would encounter after entering into this region. That was because what they would see in the end would be an outsider bringing a Dragon Pearl out of this area, and whichever clan this outsider represented, the Dragon Pearl would then be obtained by that clan.

Ling Han also found Du Shaojun here, and asked this “local” about the detailed proceedings of the contest. However, Du Shaojun was also not very familiar with this. He had only heard the predecessors say that they should not all choose a single side. In fact, joining the side of a strong team might not be a good idea, either.

This made Ling Han very confused. Why couldn’t they all choose one side? In fact, when there was a difference in opinion, joining the strongest side was not a good idea, either?

Du Shaojun wasn’t very sure, either, and also could not figure out what the reason for doing so was.

“I don’t care what others say. In my opinion, the most effort-saving method is for everyone to choose the same clan to join,” he said thus.

Ling Han also thought that there was nothing wrong with this choice, but since the “veterans” said this, there had to be a reason for it.

The people who were in charge of communicating with the seven clans were the four super monarch tiers—Tian Qingyue and the other supreme existences. In the eyes of the people of the Universal Peace Heaven and the surrounding Heavenly Realms, there was no other that was more qualified than these four people.

However, those that had personally seen Ling Han and Ji Wuming stimulate the black dragon bridge did not think so, but this portion of people was not large. Thus, they could not influence the opinion of the majority.

Ling Han was fine with it, though. In any case, this was not inconsistent with his ideas.

Tian Qingyue and the others did not rashly make any decisions, but rather negotiated with the seven great clans, choosing the best offer. Since their choice involved the fates of the seven great clans, they naturally had to get a good price.

The treasure that the seven clans were willing to offer was called Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes.

It was formed from the remaining bones of the ancient Heavenly Dragon mixed together with dirt, and had been diluted who knew how many times over, but it was precisely because of this that they were able to use it. Otherwise, how could a mere Dividing Soul Tier touch the bones that a Celestial King Tier had left behind? Merely coming close to it would cause their body to crumble and bones to shatter.

What was the use of Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes?

It was to multiply the benefits that one would get when the Hundred Dragons instilled power randomly ranging from double to tenfold.

The greater the amplification, the more Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes would naturally be needed, and the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes was also incredibly precious to the seven clans. Those were Celestial King Tier remains, and had been left behind by the elites of the Dragon Tribe at that. To these people that possessed the bloodline of the Dragon Tribe, it was naturally even more valuable and beneficial.

Thus, if all of them were going to join a single clan, whichever clan would not be able to offer too high a price. Moreover, they weren’t dumb, either. With so many people joining their clan, it was definitely an assured victory for them, so why would they still have to offer a high price?

And the matter was thus stalled like this. In any case, there was still some time before the contest began, so everyone still had the opportunity to bargain.

Ling Han was not concerned about this. He found a local of Azure Dragon Town, and asked about where their Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes had come from.

At the beginning, he was only thinking of giving it a try, but he had not expected that these people would actually really tell him.

…They had been picked up from the mountain.

This was just like a mineral ore. When you found this kind of rock, the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes would be contained inside. Of course, this kind of mineral ore was extremely rare, and there would be competitors as well—the wild beasts in the mountains. They, too, yearned for the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes as they could help them become stronger. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In this place, though there was a clear cultivation hierarchy, whether among the wild beasts or the Dragonmen, they did not cultivate the Regulations of heaven and earth, but those of the unique environment that had been created after 100 Divine Dragons had died. If they left this Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm, then the Regulations that they had grasped would be instantly erased.

That was because the “Regulations” that they had grasped were not recognized at all by the heaven and earth, and could only be used here.

From a certain aspect, they were also cultivators of a different cultivation system, but their cultivation was still based on the Regulations of the Celestial Realm. Thus, they would still gain approval from the heaven and earth to a certain extent. At least, their lifespan would not be severed together with their cultivation.

And precisely because of this, there was no need for them to go to a specific location to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier. It could completely be done here.

It was the same naturally for the Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier, but their highest accomplishment would be capped at the Ascending Origin Tier because this dimension had been formed by a mystical power of a Celestial King Tier. They could not possibly attain that level, but only reach the level that was below it.

In curiosity, Ling Han decided to walk around in the mountains to see if he could get some Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes.

Because the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes were too difficult to obtain, the townspeople not only told Ling Han where the Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes could be found, they did not even forbid him from going there.

[1] In the last chapter, he had the surname of Bao, but in this chapter, it became Bo.

[2] His name sounds like the Chinese name for ‘pineapple’, but actually has different characters.
