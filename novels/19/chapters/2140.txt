Chapter 2141: Tricked

Only then did Ling Han break into a smile. “Finally, we have some sincerity. All right, I will take a blow from you.”

He first took over the Celestial medicines from An Ran’s hands. If she refused, he would not begin the bet, either, so An Ran could only give in. However, An Ran was not concerned, either. In any case, once Ling Han died, she would be able to take back whatever she gave out.

“Are you done?” An Ran asked impatiently.

She had never accommodated someone so much before. Even if there hadn’t been the previous matter of betrothal, she would’ve felt an impulse to kill Ling Han.

“Sure, of course,” Ling Han replied, laughing.

“Young Master Ling,” Manager Chen spoke up. He knew An Ran very well. She was definitely not betting with Ling Han for fun, but was rather going to take Ling Han’s life without the slightest hesitation. Otherwise, she would not have been An Ran.

Thus, Manager Chen wanted to advise Ling Han not to do so. At a critical moment, he would even use brute force to forcibly take the other away and leave.

Ling Han was a person that Shang Zhiwei had deliberately instructed that he had to take good care of, and no harm could be allowed to come to him.

“It’s fine.” Ling Han winked at Manager Chen.

Manager Chen was inwardly surprised. In his impression, Ling Han was definitely not the type that would be so greedy to the point of risking his own life, what more when this was no longer a risk he was taking, but rather committing suicide.

Why had Ling Han agreed to the battle? Could it be that he had some kind of special technique to deal with an Immortal Palace Tier?

Hesitating, Manager Chen took a step back, and made no further attempt to stop them.

An Ran moved.?Boom, her slender hand spread open, her fingers like mountains that enveloped Ling Han.

Weng, Ling Han’s figure trembled. The whole 30,000 meters of surrounding space warped to become multiple mirrors, and an image of Ling Han was placed in every single mirror.

This…!

An Ran couldn’t help but falter. Which of them was Ling Han’s true self?

This move had indeed exceeded her expectations. Ling Han had actually grasped Regulations of Space, and was actually so skilled at them!

Boom

, the attack surged past, and the Space Mirrors shattered one after another. The Ling Hans within them were also naturally shattered by the impact, but there were still around one-third of Space Mirrors that were unscathed.

As long as there was still one Spiritual Void Manifestation, Ling Han’s true self could freely switch with it. Thus, this blow naturally did not cause the slightest bit of damage to Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled. “Thank you for the business, please see yourself out.”

You!

An Ran was first taken aback, and then flew into an abrupt fury.

She naturally knew that she had fallen for Ling Han’s trick. This brat was really a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He had obviously grasped the Regulations of Space, and possessed a very strong survival ability, yet pretended to use all sorts of excuses, purposely inciting her to take out Celestial medicines to use as stakes for their bet.

Too devious, too cunning. Was this still a man?

Meanwhile, Manager Chen was stroking his beard and smiling slightly. So it turned out that Ling Han had this kind of ability. No wonder he dared to accept such a bet. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

An Ran glared at Ling Han for a while, and then said, “Take another blow from me!”

“Yi, didn’t you just say that I only have to take one blow?” Ling Han feigned shock.

An Ran was indeed overbearing, but she was also proud at the same time. Hearing Ling Han’s words, her face involuntarily reddened.

With her status, she should not have made a move on a Dividing Soul Tier, and now making a move once was not enough, and she actually wanted to do it a second time. This was too embarrassing.

“Do you dare take another blow from me?” She could only continue to spur him on like this.

Ling Han extended his hand, and then crooked a finger. “Take out another three Celestial medicines, and they all have to be over a billion years in age.” If the Celestial medicine was over a billion years old, then even a Dividing Soul Tier could use them. Of course, if it was 10 billion years or 100 billion years and above, that would definitely be even better.

An Ran thought for a while. She had already seen this move from Ling Han, so it was definitely impossible that she would be deceived again.

Fine, again!

She took out another three Celestial medicines, and they were all over a billion years in age. Only someone like her, a disciple of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, would be that wealthy.

Ling Han accepted them happily, smiling widely, and stated, “Come on then.”

An Ran moved again. This time, she had directly used a celestial technique. A desolate aura surged out. It was as if she had become a great beast that originated from the ancient era. She only had to move slightly, and she would be capable of even shattering the heaven and earth.

Having fallen for Ling Han’s trick once, she set aside all her previous contempt, and considered Ling Han as a real opponent.

Boom, she sent out a punch. Instantly, the space was ripped apart, and the force endlessly spread out in all directions. In an instant, it had covered an area of 30,000 meters, and was still spreading out continuously.

Ling Han did not use the power of Space, but rather took this blow head-on.

Boom, the strike immediately landed solidly on him, and his figure was sent flying like he was a cannonball.

However, An Ran, Manager Chen, and Lin Xuan all showed expressions of shock at the same time.

That was because though Ling Han had been sent flying, his body was completely undamaged!

How was this possible?

Taking such a terrifying blow, Ling Han should logically have been turned into pieces. How was it possible that he was practically unharmed?

…There were indeed some traces of blood at the corners of his lips, but this kind of injury was completely negligible. He was still who knew how far off from actual death.

With a?bang, Ling Han crashed heavily into a stone pillar, and his body was immediately stopped. Then, he slid back down, but before his body had landed completely on the ground, he had already stood up by himself.

He had taken another blow, and he had done so with great ease.

…This was because he had directly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and for a short time, his defenses would be boosted to a terrifying extent. He would be able to easily take on even the full force blow of a First Secret monarch tier.

An Ran and the others were gaping widely, still in a state of deep shock and astonishment.

Previously, though Ling Han had also parried a strike from An Ran, it had been due to a stroke of cleverness, and he had not confronted An Ran directly. However, it was completely different this time round. Ling Han had sustained a blow head-on, and it was a blow with full force from An Ran at that.

A-awesome to the extreme!

With this strike, there was nothing An Ran could say or complain about. However, she became even more infuriated.

You obviously had that kind of strength, but why had you not used it during the first time?

This guy was clearly wanting to scam her for her Celestial medicines!

Realization suddenly dawned on her. This guy that looked to be slightly dumb was instead a prodigy. He had deliberately lured her into the trap, tricking her twice for her Celestial medicines.

Had she ever been tricked before?

There was definitely no such instance!

Firstly, no one would dare, and secondly, with her prodigious genius, who could successfully trick her?

Yet now, one such person had appeared. He had not only tricked her, he had done it twice.

An Ran was angered to the point of madness. However, she had no choice but to be impressed by Ling Han’s strength. This guy was really outrageously bold, and he did indeed have heaven-defying techniques. Even she had to admit that she was impressed.

“Good Good! Good!” She said the word three times. Even if she was angered to the point of wanting to commit murder, she could not bring herself to make another move on Ling Han.

If she were to move on a Dividing Soul Tier three times consecutively, her pride would not allow that.

She turned and left. At least for the moment, she could not possibly come again to deal with Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Lin Xuan looked longer at Ling Han before turning around, and leaving as well.

He had already tagged Ling Han as a powerful enemy that he had to get rid of. His display was too heaven-defying. If he broke through again to the Immortal Palace Tier, then wouldn’t he be completely unmatched?

“Young Master Ling, very well done!” Manager Chen said, smiling widely, and even gave Ling Han a thumbs-up.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Manager Chen is too polite. This junior just has thick skin and coarse flesh.”

Manager Chen only smiled in response. Ling Han was both brave and smart. It was nothing as simple as just having heaven-defying defenses. Furthermore, he dared to even trick Holy Daughter An Ran. In the Four Seas Palace, this was definitely the first time it happened.
