Chapter 2501: Blessed by the heaven and earth, Third Heaven Celestial King!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han fused the two realms. His speed was very fast. In a short decade, he had already fused a galaxy, but in terms of the expansiveness of the Ancient Realm, this was just a negligible beginning.

He immersed himself within, and boundless enlightenment rose up within him.

The Ancient Realm was actually a part of the Celestial Realm. Using himself as core, and fusing the two realms was equivalent to becoming the overlord of a realm a second time. Amidst the change, he glimpsed the changes in the heaven and earth and the surging of that unique energy.

Even a Heavenly Venerate could not destroy this realm. No matter how great the destruction, under this unique energy, it would still rebuild itself, and nurture new life. Unless the Celestial Realm itself crumbled, no one could truly destroy this place.

Primordial time flowed in Ling Han’s body. The Ancient Realm had existed for as long as the Celestial Realm, but Ling Han could not possibly enter into the core of the Celestial Realm. He did not have that kind of strength, and it was too straining even for a Heavenly Venerate. And the present circumstances were special. Three great Heavenly Venerates had split out the Ancient Realm, granting Ling Han an opportunity to fuse the two realms into one.

This was forced by the circumstances, and the heaven and earth also had that inclination. Otherwise, the Two Realm Battlefield would not have appeared. This was an instinctive desire to fuse back into one.

Thus, the heaven and earth could not resist Ling Han’s “kind offer.”

This benefited Ling Han. Something indestructible, everlasting was surging in his mind, allowing him to study and learn. This was a power that belonged only to the Celestial Realm, and was unique. Even the Ancient Realm had a slight bit of its mark left behind, and Ling Han continuously grasped it, turning it into his own comprehension.

He was overjoyed.

This kind of great opportunity was too rare. It was equivalent to three great Heavenly Venerates blessing him with good fortune simultaneously; how many people in this world could get that?

He forgot all else, and immersed himself in this kind of enlightenment. He continued to fuse the two realms to obtain more of that ancient material.

100 years, 1,000 years, time passed swiftly.

Ling Han forgot about time. In fact, he wanted nothing more than for this to never end.

More and more people that had heard of the news came. Everyone could feel the change in the heaven and earth. The two realms were fusing, and then… there would be only one!

The heaven and earth of the Immortal Realm no longer targeted the beings of the Netherworld, and the heaven and earth of the Netherworld was the same. No, no, no, the Immortal Realm and Netherworld no longer existed. There was only one single realm—the Ancient Realm!

“Milord!”

“Milord!”

“Milord!”

Everyone knelt down with great respect. They could sense that the heaven and earth that they could touch was more complete, and there was a chance that they could advance into a higher level.

To fuse these two realms into one, just what kind of great power was needed?

This naturally filled everyone with reverence, and everyone could see the benefit of this, so how could they not feel extreme gratitude towards Ling Han?

However, by now, no one could see Ling Han’s true figure any longer. He was enshrouded in an incredibly ancient substance, buried deep within. Still, he still maintained the vague shape of a man sitting in a cross-legged position, but his figure became bigger and bigger. This was because Ling Han was gradually extracting more of this ancient material.

Several thousand years later, this had become a sacred place. On planets who knew how far away, there would still be people coming here to visit, and bow down in gratitude towards Ling Han.

But there were also some who did not believe the “legend,” and thought that a natural treasure had actually appeared here, and thus made a move. But it was not possible for them to even come close, as they would directly explode into dust. As the number of such cases grew, naturally, no one dared to make an attempt. They all obediently worshiped from the sidelines.

10,000 years, 30,000 years, 100,000 years… 1,000,000 years!

Ling Han suddenly awakened from his enlightened state because the two realms were completely merged. In the future, there would no longer be any Immortal Realm or Netherworld, only the Ancient Realm.

It ended just like that?

Ling Han couldn’t help but purse his lips. He hadn’t had enough yet.

He had a feeling that the mark of the unique power of the Celestial Realm had been planted in his body. Even if he went into a transcendent dimension, as long as he had attained the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, he could still cultivate to the Heavenly Venerable Tier through this mark.

And the transcendent dimensions would similarly possess this unique power. If Ling Han could fuse these two powers into one… then how strong would he be as a First Tier Heavenly Venerate?

To say nothing of reaching the height of the Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, would he be even able to sweep aside all other First Tier Heavenly Venerates?

Thankfully he had fused the two realms only now. If he had done this when he had only been in the Genesis Tier, he would definitely have wasted this great opportunity.

“Huh?!”

To his shock, he discovered that his cultivation level had actually reached the peak stage of the Second Heaven without his knowledge!

There was too much enlightenment and appreciation obtained from fusing the two realms. It had previously been mentioned that this was equivalent to the three Heavenly Venerates helping him raise his cultivation level; how could his cultivation level not progress rapidly through over a million years’ time?

However, why was there no heavenly tribulation?

Could it be that this was because he was helping the heaven and earth, so the heaven and earth had deliberately given him a special privilege?

En, what a strange feeling. He had broken through, but there actually was no heavenly tribulation.

Kuang, a sudden change took place in the heaven and earth. Boundless fragrance descended, enshrouding Ling Han.

Ling Han’s cultivation level instantly began to increase. Boundless enlightenment rose up in his mind, great dao manifested. The Celestial Seed had long since grown into a giant tree, and a Celestial Flower had bloomed on it. Then, it rapidly wilted, bearing a single fruit.

The third transformation of the Celestial Seed!

He was going to become a Third Heaven Celestial King.

This… Ling Han was surprised. The heaven and earth actually bestowed great fortune on him?

What good deed had he done? Hadn’t Heavenborn said that he had been an unfilial child?

Realization instantly dawned on Ling Han. He had fused the two realms, and this was a great contribution to the heaven and earth. Furthermore, the heaven and earth was unfeeling, and was the most just. Since he had contributed, there naturally had to be reward.

Under the good fortune brought by the heaven and earth, he advanced into Third Heaven without a doubt. The Celestial Seed transformed wildly. The Celestial Tree had borne a fruit, and the fruit dropped, immediately sprouting, growing, and turning back once more into a Celestial Tree. Of course, it was just a tiny tree.

It could not be helped. Though the merit of fusing the Ancient Realm back into one was massive, the Ancient Realm was only subsidiary to the Celestial Realm, and had limited “power.” Being able to push Ling Han up to the Third Heaven was still because he had previously already reached the peak stage of the Second Heaven, and so he just happened to need but a single push to send him into Third Heaven.

Kuang, this time, the heaven and earth no longer bent the law for him. Thunderclouds gathered densely in the skies, and the heavenly tribulation was already here.

This heavenly tribulation was extremely terrifying. There was not the slightest bit of weakening. In fact, it had reached the level of Fourth Heaven Celestial King Tier in battle prowess.

Ling Han did not dare be careless. He hurriedly unleashed his cultivation level.?Boom, Celestial King Tier aura surged out, instantly spreading throughout the entire Ancient Realm.

Firstly, this was because he was too strong, and secondly, he had fused the Ancient Realm into one, and it was inevitable that he had also left behind a sliver of his own mark within, just like a precious tool. Thus, the transmission of his willpower was also overwhelmingly fast.

Celestial King Tier aura gushed out. This was a power that was invincible in the Ancient Realm. In fact, no one was worthy of even looking up at this kind of power.

Instantly, everyone fell to their knees, trembling wildly.

Boom, a massive black hole appeared, swallowing Ling Han up whole, and the tribulation clouds that filled the skies also disappeared instantly without a trace.

Ling Han was too powerful, and could not be accommodated in this realm. He had to leave. Otherwise, it would either be the Ancient Realm that would crush him to death, or he would be bursting the Ancient Realm into bits.

Hence, he left.

Ling Han crossed over the realm barrier. As long as one’s power reached the peak stage of the Genesis Tier, they would be worthy of bursting through this realm barrier, and enter into the Celestial Realm, and Ling Han was already a Third Heaven Celestial King by now. Just how strong had his battle prowess become? Naturally, he easily penetrated straight into the Celestial Realm.

The scenery in front of his eyes changed suddenly. He appeared in a forest. A familiar air assailed him, and he knew that he had returned to the Celestial Realm.

Kuang, thunder boomed alarmingly. The heavenly tribulation was hot on his tail.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Come on, let me see just what level my strength has reached.”
