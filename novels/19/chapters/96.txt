Chapter 97: Imparting

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

With a “ding”, Nangong Ji was forced back by this strike. He glared furiously at Ling Han, and said, “Who are you to dare to meddle in my affairs? Don’t you know that interfering in a battle is a very serious offense?!”

Ling Han smiled softly and said, “He can no longer continue the battle, so this battle is already over. However, if you would like to have a spar with me, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson.”

Nangong Ji glared angrily. Zhu Wu Jiu had actually managed to form a flash of Sword Qi, and now possessed the preliminary qualifications to step into the ranks of rulers. Zhu Wu Jiu may one day become a huge problem for him, and he had originally intended to finish him off completely today. He had never thought that their battle would be interrupted with Ling Han’s interference.

“Brat, those who meddle too much in the affairs of others never have a good ending!” He threatened. Now, it was no longer possible for him to kill Zhu Wu Jiu on the spot, so his heart was filled with furious rage.

“You either battle with me now, or get lost. Don’t babble so much!” Ling Han said disdainfully.

Nangong Ji looked very angered, yet in the end, he left in great strides with a wave of his hands.

After feeling Ling Han’s sword strike just now, he knew that the former was definitely not weaker than himself. Moreover, he was a cautious person, and would never go into battle unprepared. Since he was no longer able to kill Zhu Wu Jiu, he simply chose to leave.

However, judging from his character, this matter would not simply end like this. He would first investigate Ling Han’s background thoroughly, and then decide what was to be done.

“Who’s this guy, actually daring to oppose Nangong Ji?”

“Should be one of the new students this year, right?”

“From the looks of his aura, he only seems to be in the fifth layer of Element Gathering Tier, yet he actually managed to scare off Nangong Ji. It’s really strange.”

“However, the Nangong Clan is not to be trifled with, and there’s also Nangong Xing who is a True Disciple of the Academy!”

“Forget it, we’d better not get too close to him, or we’d be inviting trouble to ourselves.”

The spectators discussed spiritedly, and very quickly departed from the Martial Training Court.

Zhu Wu Jiu slowly and painstakingly got up. The special constitution of the Silver Moon Race was indeed impressive. He had recovered considerably after this short period of rest even after receiving such a serious injury. Of course, this rate of recovery could not be compared to the healing effects of the Indestructible Heaven Scroll.

Firstly, the Indestructible Heaven Scroll was too high-level, and secondly, Zhu Wu Jiu himself was still too weak, and was unable to make full use of his special constitution’s potential.

“Why did you help me?” Zhu Wu Jiu spoke, “Aren’t you afraid of getting in trouble with the Nangong Clan?”

“Can’t it be that I helped you because I couldn’t stand the injustice happening in front of me?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“I don’t believe that there are still such naive people in this world!” Zhu Wu Jiu shook his head, “But, I live in poverty and you won’t be able to get much from me, so I advise you not to waste your energy.”

“Then…” Ling Han thought for a moment, “become my subordinate.”

“For the aid you’ve provided me today, I will definitely pay you back for your kindness another day!” Zhu Wu Jiu turned around to leave, obviously unwilling to accept the offer of becoming Ling Han’s subordinate.

Those who managed to get into Hu Yang Academy were all geniuses, so how could they be willing to be under the command of someone else?

Ling Han did not chase after him. Instead, he said calmly, “You don’t want your revenge anymore?”

Zhu Wu Jiu’s steps suddenly paused, and he slowed down.

“I can teach you!” Ling Han continued, “Within half a year, I will definitely be able to help you surpass Nangong Ji and take your revenge with your own hands!”

Zhu Wu Jiu suddenly turned back round, and said, “Really?”

“You’ve already said that you live in poverty. What would I get from lying to you?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Zhu Wu Jiu hesitated for a moment, and said, “All right, I agree to become your follower. If you are not able to help me surpass Nangong Ji within half a year, then this will be my payback for your help earlier. If you are able to, then my life will belong to you!”

This guy really was a loyal person. Still, becoming Ling Han’s subordinate was in actual fact not a bad thing to happen to him. Instead, this was an opportunity of epic proportions. If it was not for the fact that Ling Han had shared an amicable friendship with the Silver Moon King years ago, he’d definitely not be wasting so much of his effort.

“En!” Ling Han nodded, and said, “I’ll impart to you a cultivation technique, and in the future, you have to switch to practicing this cultivation technique.”

He lowered his voice and imparted a cultivation technique to Zhu Wu Jiu; it was called the Silver Moon Arts.

That’s right, this cultivation technique was created specifically for the Silver Moon Race.

Years ago, after the Silver Moon Race had been wiped out, Ling Han, after achieving a high cultivation level, had once journeyed all over in search of the survivors of the Silver Moon Race. He didn’t find anyone, but he did find this most precious cultivation technique of the Silver Moon Race, the Silver Moon Arts.

He had an excellent memory. At the time, he had only flipped through the pages once, and managed to memorize the entirety of it. Otherwise, he would not have been able to take it out now.

The Silver Moon Arts, when used by a member of the Silver Moon Race such as Zhu Wu Jiu, would fully display the might of his special constitution. At least, it would allow him to increase his battle prowess by one Star. Moreover, the Silver Moon Arts was an Earth Grade high level technique, so it would be enough to help Zhu Wu Jiu very quickly catch up to Nangong Ji in cultivation level.

Silver Moon constitution and Sword Qi. If these two strengths added together still did not allow Zhu Wu Jiu to emerge victorious over Nangong Ji, then he was really too useless.

Zhu Wu Jiu did not know that this was an Earth Grade high level cultivation technique, nor did he know that it would help him make full use of the benefits of his special constitution. After asking about Ling Han’s name and address, he left in a daze.

After all, he was still injured, so he did need to recover.

“Meat! Meat!” Hu Niu tugged on Ling Han’s sleeve in displeasure.

“All right, all right, let’s go have some meat!” Ling Han said with a laugh.

“Ling Han!”

“Brother Ling!”

Ling Han heard someone shout his name from a distance, and when he looked over, it was four of his old friends from Da Yuan City—Qi Yong Ye, Jin Wuji, Baili Teng Yun, and Li Dong Yue.

“Brother Ling came really late. Today, you must punish yourself with drinking three cups of wine,” Baili Teng Yun said.

“How could three cups be enough, there should be at least ten cups!” Li Dong Yue joined in on the banter.

“Meat! Meat! Meat!” Hu Niu jumped up and down.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Let’s go, I’ll treat you guys to a meal today, and if you’re not drunk by the end of it, you can’t leave!”

“Nobody’s leaving if they’re not drunk!” Qi Yong Ye and the others laughed. The group of five adults plus one child exited the Academy, found a restaurant and began their drinking spree.

Yet Qi Yong Ye and the others very quickly discovered gloomily that when a dish was served and there was meat in it, it would be instantly devoured by Hu Niu—not even leaving any scraps behind. They then entered into the fierce battle for food, but if you were talking about eating, who would be able to snatch food faster than Hu Niu?

The little girl didn’t even use chopsticks, and after using her bare hands to hold onto the food, how could the others find the desire to eat?

“This girl’s stomach is a bottomless pit, right?”

Qi Yong Ye and the others were all very curious, but not even Qi Yong Ye recognized that the little girl in front of him was the one from the Wrestling Ring. After all, at that time, Hu Niu was very disheveled and completely filthy, unlike how she was now. And now, while she was still very wild, she looked very pretty and dainty, like a little porcelain doll.

“I am really envious of Brother Ling. You’re already a True Disciple from the moment you enroll in the Academy, and can get your hands on uncountable resources for cultivation,” Li Dong Yue said ruefully.

Qi Yong Ye nodded, and said, “There is really too much of a gap between True Disciples and Ordinary Disciples. The gap between myself and Feng Yan hadn’t really been very big, but now… ai!”

“Fourth Prince, no matter what, at least you still have the Royal House of the Da Yuan King supporting you, so you’re already much better than the rest of us,” Jin Wuji said immediately. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“That’s right, the resources from the Royal House of the Da Yuan King are even more abundant than the resources of all our four great parties added together. If you’re going to complain about being poor, how are we supposed to go on?” Baili Teng Yun called out.

“Ling Han, I heard you have some grudges with Feng Luo. He’s also entered the Academy now, so you have to be careful. He might ask Feng Yan to deal with you,” Qi Yong Ye said all of a sudden.
