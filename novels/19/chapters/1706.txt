Chapter 1707: The Tong Clan’s ancestor makes an apology

Changsun Liang was indeed a very proud man. There was nothing that could be done about it. He was the Holy Son of the Black Moon Sect, and also a king tier that had removed himself from worldly affairs. It was very normal for him to be prideful. Furthermore, it was indeed difficult for any ordinary person to be worthy of his serious attention.

But in his bones, he was a very lonely person. That was because everyone was inferior to him, so how was he supposed to make any friends?

The fact that Ling Han managed to battle him to a tie, and the Empress was even stronger than him, not only caused his fighting spirit to burn brightly, but also made it very easy for him to accept these two people as his close friends.

However, the Empress had a strong tendency to become jealous, so he could only rearrange the places of Ling Han and the Empress so they would sit facing each other. Yet he did not dare ask to be seated beside Ling Han, fearing that he would be tossed out by the Empress again.

...He still wanted to keep some face.

The banquet continued, and after the great battle previously, everyone felt dizzy and dazzled, and could not calm their racing hearts. Meanwhile, Yuan Xingping and Dan Yujing wore pained expressions. It was only a battle, but it had already decided Ling Han’s position. Who would be able to defeat such a king tier in the competition?

Putting aside that 10 were not enough, even if the over 200 teams ganged up on him, it was still a question whether they would be able to deal with him.

They could only hope that they would not encounter him too soon, or their result would definitely be elimination.

After drinking for a while, Changsun Liang began to explore the art of cultivation with Ling Han. He was indeed a prodigy. If there was any area that he was inferior to Ling Han in, that was that he had not cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, nor did he have the opportunity to merge the Regulations of two Realms in the Ancient Realm.

But in the area of comprehension of great dao, he had his own unique understanding, giving Ling Han inspiration through comprehension via analogy.

This discussion lasted a good few hours, but those in the surroundings did not have the slightest bit of impatience. This was insights about cultivation of two king tiers. It was fine even if they could not understand them now. They only had to remember the information, and it would definitely be of great help to them in future if they could digest even the slightest bit.

“It is unfortunate, Brother Ling, that you have not reached Saint King Tier now. There is only one year’s time, and you would not be able to make it for the opening of the Severing Mundane Pool,” Changsun Liang said, his expression filled with pity. “The location for Severing Mundane must be carefully chosen. Severing one’s mortal bonds at different places would directly affect your future battle prowess. Thus, it is better to wait for more than 10,000,000 years than to take this step in a hurry.”

This was priceless advice. It was not that Changsun Liang wanted Ling Han to break through to the Severing Mundane Tier more than 10,000,000 years later than himself. Instead, he was sincerely considering for Ling Han’s sake.

Ling Han only smiled. He had a great chance not only to be able to break through to the Saint King Tier in this one and a half year’s time, but also possess enough accumulation to manage the feat of Severing Mundane.

That was because he possessed the Reincarnation Tree!

To others, it would be just over a year, but for him, it was tens of thousands of years, which was more than enough time.

Meanwhile, the Empress was not the slightest bit worried. She had always been filled with confidence in Ling Han.

The red-haired young man had already regained consciousness. After some medical treatment, he could already move with ease, but he definitely did not dare battle anymore. That was because his bones had only been temporarily joined. If he fought again, they would definitely shatter.

Suddenly, a slight commotion rose up outside the main hall. The red-haired young man hurriedly ran out to see what was going on. This was Celestial Clouds Island; who would dare come here to make trouble?

After a while, he returned, and said to Changsun Liang, “Lord Holy Son, the Tong Clan’s ancestor has come to visit personally, and wishes to apologize to you.”

The descendant of his own clan had been killed, and as an elder, he actually came here to pay an apology?

That was natural. Changsun Liang was the Holy Son, and would become the sect master of the Black Moon Sect in future, but Tong Lin actually dared to have public s*x on Celestial Clouds Island. Naturally, if he had been killed by Changsun Liang, he deserved it. In fact, for the sake of avoiding being implicated, the Tong Clan’s ancestor would have to personally pay a visit to apologize.

Changsun Liang thought for a slight moment, and said, “Invite him in.”

Though he was the Holy Son, he still had to give some face to a fourth severance grand elder.

The red-haired young man nodded, and ran out to relay Changsun Liang’s message.

Another while later, a middle-aged man strode over. Though he had kept his aura under wraps, wherever he passed, those around could not help but hold their breaths, feeling as if the heavens themselves were about to collapse.

This was the Tong Clan’s ancestor.

Because one would gain a limitless lifespan after advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, it was natural that he would not age. Thus, whatever he looked like when he entered into Severing Mundane Tier, he would continue to maintain this appearance—unless one encountered the Immortal Tribulation; then he would age incredibly, and be inflicted with ineradicable disease.

Just looking at the appearance of the Tong Clan’s ancestor, one would know how astonishing his natural talent in cultivation was; he had broken through at a very “young” age.

Changsun Liang stood up with clasped hands, and said, “Elder Tong.” The other man was a four star elder, and though his standing in the sect was inferior to his, his seniority and strength were clear, so he still had to give him some face.

The Tong Clan’s ancestor also clasped his hands, and loudly said, “Greetings, Holy Son!”

The two of them exchanged pleasantries for a while, and the Tong Clan’s ancestor directly expressed the reason for his visit. He harshly denounced Tong Lin for a while, and expressed that it was a good thing that Changsun Liang had killed him, having killed a degenerate son for the Tong Clan. After apologizing for the third time, he finally begged his leave and departed.

However, when he left, he took Liu Muyu with him. It was possible that he was planning to vent his fury on this woman—it took two to tango. If Tong Lin wanted to have public s*x, couldn’t she have vowed to die rather than obey?

Regarding Tong Lin’s death, Ling Han naturally would not feel the slightest bit of pity, but Liu Muyu would definitely tell the truth, and by then, he would have made another enemy.

Tong Lin had indeed been killed by Changsun Liang, but would the Tong Clan dare to seek out Changsun Liang for revenge?

So they naturally would turn onto Ling Han instead.

After a day, the banquet finally ended. Changsun Liang commanded the red-haired young man to drive a carriage to send Ling Han and the Empress back, which was proof enough of their special treatment.

When everyone returned, the events that happened during the banquet immediately spread throughout the entire Black Moon Sect. As long as it was a Severing Mundane Clan, all of them had heard of Ling Han’s and the Empress’s name. But in the relay station, there were only a rare few teams that knew how strong Ling Han was, and they did not broadcast it widely.

The various great forces were all investigating Ling Han’s and the Empress’s origins. How could such prodigies have suddenly appeared just like this?

Before they had clarified the circumstances, the various great forces did not dare casually set out conditions to gain their favor. What if these two people were the Holy Son and Holy Daughter of some great sect? Wouldn’t their actions become a joke then?

Ling Han and the Empress returned to their accommodations, and Mao Shuyu and the others ran over to find out what had happened. The floating islands were forbidden lands to them, but the more they were unable to go, the more curious they were about them.

Ling Han felt amused. These people were the level of prodigies in the eyes of others, yet were actually as curious as little children now.

Putting aside them, even Long Gaofei was very curious, and very much wanted to find out all the details. When they returned, he could pretend that he had visited the floating islands, which caused Ling Han to shake his head in humor.

Only a day had passed, and Changsun Liang had actually come over, again discussing cultivation with Ling Han. This made Long Gaofei feel incredibly excited.

The Holy Son of the Black Moon Sect, the future sect master!

If Dark Moon City... no, if the Long Clan could make a connection with him, they would definitely be rich.

At first, he planned to have some young sons of the Long Clan court the Empress when they returned, but his decision had naturally been changed by now. Ling Han’s value had suddenly soared, which caused him to treat him with incredible regard.

“You guys go on and talk slowly. It’s fine no matter how long you want to discuss. I’ll keep an eye on the time so that you won’t miss the competition,” he said, and even personally closed the doors behind him.

The old man was all smiles, but he had just arrived at the courtyard when the doors of the courtyard were broken in, and an old man whose expression was filled with fury walked inGett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
