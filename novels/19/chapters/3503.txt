Chapter 3504- House arrest

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor; Henyee Translations

What was the meaning of this?

Was he hiding murderous intent behind his smile?

Ling Han also smiled faintly, and said, “I never thought that Brother Tu would actually know of us?”

“Hehe, the two of you are now popular people, the two Department Chiefs of the Foreign Affairs Department, with overwhelming power, so how could I possibly be ignorant?” Tu Jianbai was also all smiles.

When these words fell, the other disciples were all surprised. These two people were really from some Foreign Affairs Department, and from Second Senior Brother’s words, this department seemed to be very extraordinary.

Princess Bixiao spoke up, “We would like to see Sect Leader Gongsun. Would Brother Tu be willing to introduce us?”

“introductions is naturally no problem, but Lord Sect Master is indeed very busy, so he may not be able to find the time.” Tu Jianbai pretended to be troubled.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao looked at each other. They both knew that Tu Jianbai was only deliberately declining. No matter how busy he was, how could he be so busy that he did not even have the time to see others?

Moreover, they weren’t ordinary people. Instead, they represented the Foreign Affairs Department and Chen Fengyan.

However, with Tu Jianbai greeting them with such a smiling face, they could not bring themselves to become hostile. Otherwise, the saying of how Dark North Nation was unreasonable would spread, and if this was used by certain forces, it could possibly be very troublesome.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Then well stay here for a few days. Hopefully, Sect Leader Gongsun can see us as soon as possible.

“No problem, no problem.” Tu Jianbai nodded, and made a gesture of invitation, “Please follow me, the two of you.”

Seeing Tu Jianbai lead Ling Han, Princess Bixiao and the babies up the mountain, the disciples at the foot of the mountain were all defiant. One of their own had already been beaten, and in the end, the culprit was allowed to go unpunished just like that?

“Who exactly are these two people?”

“And what is the Foreign Affairs Department?”

“Second Senior Brother obviously knows, but why did he not tell us?

Everyone was filled with confusion.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao were arranged to stay in an extremely beautiful courtyard. It was huge. To say nothing of the fact that there were only two adults and seven children, even if there were a dozen or so adults, this would be able to completely accommodate them.

“What motive does he have for dragging us along like this?” Princess Bixiao asked in confusion, “No matter how much he drags things on, this matter has to be resolved eventually.”

Ling Han tapped the table lightly, and said, “Gongsun Liang doesn’t want to fall out with His Majesty yet.”

“He’s not willing to surrender to our Empire, so he’s deliberately trying to avoid meeting us?” Princess Bixiao shook her head, and said, “Just hke I said before, this matter can’t be dragged on forever.”

Ling Han stopped knocking on the table, and broke into a grin, “In the present situation, he can only delay. Once he meets us, there are only two options left for him. One is to surrender, and the other is not to surrender and then, we will meet on the battlefield.”

“Neither of these are the results he wants.”

“Could it be that he has a third option?” Princess Bixiao asked.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, before saying, “Don’t forget that there’s a gigantic prison beneath us. Every once in a while, elites will appear. Thus, perhaps Gongsun Liang is waiting for someone.

“An existence that can stand against His Majesty?” Princess Bixiao asked.

“I don’t know if he can stand against His Majesty, but Gongsun Liang clearly thinks he can. Thus, he wants to drag things out until this person comes out. In that case, he can ignore us,” Ling Han said. He paused, then continued, “In fact, he can even…”

He made a slicing motion with his hand, and Princess Bixiao naturally understood.

“At present, this elite has not come out yet. Perhaps, he would be trapped for a day, or perhaps a year, so Gongsun Liang would not dare to do anything to us at present, but when that person comes out—” Princess Bixiao did not continue.

The present situation should be very clear.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “That’s right. Our situation is extremely dire. In fact, it can even be said that we’ve walked right into a trap.”

“You can still laugh?” Princess Bixiao asked in displeasure.

“If crying could solve the problem, then why would I need to cultivate?” Ling Han said.

Princess Bixiao couldn’t help but be rendered speechless. Why was this guy so simple-minded?

However, when she recalled that the two of them still had the war colossus with them, she gradually calmed down.

The war colossus could sweep aside all other Foundation Building Tier cultivators. Worse come to worst, they could just force their way out.

■■We can’t keep waiting here either. If a powerful cultivator of Core Formation Tier really appears, we won’t be able to hold on.” Ling Han pondered for a moment, then said, “Just three days. After three days, if that Gongsun Liang is still hiding and unwilling to come out, we’ll take the initiative to meet him.

“Em” Princess Bixiao nodded. They had come to demand allegiance, so how could they run away with their tails between their legs without even seeing Gongsun Liang?

The night passed, and the sun had just risen. Ling Han continued to cultivate as per usual. When he was done, he opened the doors, planning to walk around on the mountain.

“Lord Ling!” Unexpectedly, there were two men standing outside the doors, and they immediately stretched out a hand to stop him, “There are a great many secret places in the sect, and it is not convenient for outsiders to visit, so please stay here, Lord Ling. I am sure that Lord Sect Master will soon summon

Lord Ling.”

Ling Han was surprised. Was he going to put him under house arrest?

“I’ll just walk around nearby,” he said with a smile.

“Lord Ling, please don’t make things difficult for us!” a tall man said. He even pointed ahead, where there was a ballista. “That’s the Exploding Clouds Crossbow. Killing a Mystery Realm Tier elite wouldn’t be difficult.”

“Thus, it would be best for Lord Ling to retreat.

Ling Han glanced at the ballistae, and said, “Please pass on this message to Sect Leader Gong Sun. We will be staying here for three days. After three days, if Sect Leader Gong Sun is still unable to find the time, then we can only take our leave.”

He stepped back with a smile, and closed the doors behind him.

“Pei, who do you think you are? You’ve lost your backbone after being scared.” “To dare come to our Highest Splendor Sect and behave atrociously, he has chosen the wrong place.”

A voice drifted in from outside.

Ling Han did not fly into a rage. He arrived at a high altitude, and swept his gaze over the surroundings. He saw that there were people standing guard all around the courtyard. Furthermore, there was not just one of those so-called Exploding Cloud Crossbows, but rather covered all around the courtyard. No matter which direction Ling Han charged out from, he would be met with a head-on blow.

He, he had really placed them under house arrest here.

Ling Han related the situation to the Demon Race princess, and the woman instantly flew into a thunderous rage, wanting to immediately mobilize the war colossus to charge out.

“There’S no rush. We agreed on three days,” Ling Han said, a mischievous smile on his face.

“What do you want to do?” Princess Bixiao asked.

“Shh, if worse comes to worst, I’ll give you some benefits.” Ling Han gestured for her to keep quiet.

Princess Bixiao found this strange. ‘You’re placed under house arrest here, so you can either charge out of here, or stay here obediently. What else can you do?’

Could it be?

Sixth Baby!

She suddenly recalled that Sixth Baby possessed the ability of invisibility. Could it be that Ling Han wanted Sixth Baby to steal something? However, there were Celestial level elites standing guard here, so how difficult would it be to steal something?

Since she couldn’t figure it out, she might as well not think about it.

At night, Ling Han had Sixth Baby bring the Essence Nurturing Gourd while he himself hid inside, and Sixth Baby brought him out of here.

Under the night sky, a small gourd “silently” flew out, and no one noticed it..
