2650 Gathered Together

Without the Dimension Scroll, directly absorbing the fundamental power of the Genesis World was far too difficult.

As freakish as Ling Han was, and even though he had already come across Void Particle Energy before, it still took him upwards 1000 years to finally attract a single Void Particle. However, this was only the beginning of his pain. The explosion of chaotic energy left him severely wounded.

Ling Han continued to cycle through this process. He would attract a Void Particle with much difficulty, and then he would suffer severe wounds after withstanding its chaotic explosion. He would then continue to heal his wounds as he extracted the particle’s energy to temper his physique.

Without a doubt, this was an agonizing process. However, Ling Han could indeed feel his Body Art improving. Even though this was a slow process, one that couldn’t compare to extracting energy from the Dimension Scroll, it was still like opening a treasure chamber.

A Dimension Scroll could be exhausted, yet as long as the Genesis World wasn’t destroyed, fundamental power would never be exhausted. Thus, this second method could be used forever.

What was the most important?

Ling Han could already sense and absorb Void Particle Energy. This signified that as long as he could become a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, he was guaranteed to eventually become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

After another seven million years, the Empress also concluded her cultivation.

She had also mastered the Five Elements Lightning Technique, and she had more so reached the barrier to the Seventh Heaven.

The Empress faced her tribulation.

This was a difficult process as the higher one’s cultivation level, the more brutal heavenly tribulation would become. This was especially the case for supreme monarch stars who had to experience heavenly tribulation that was far superior to their cultivation level.

Fortunately, relying on her mastery of the Five Elements Lightning, she was able to reduce the threat that the bolts of lightning posed to her. After successfully overcoming her tribulation, the Empress entered the Celestial Guest Residence to stabilize her cultivation.

Meanwhile, Ling Han had already completed this process long ago. He stood up and strode forward.

This palace very likely held an ultimate secret, and this was something that piqued his interest.

However, just as he stood up, he heard footsteps approaching from behind him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He turned around, and he involuntarily raised a brow.

Xiao Yingxiong! Miao Hua!

The two of them had actually entered the palace together.

According to the intentions of the Primordial Ancient Heavenly Venerate, only those who had mastered the four previous lightning techniques could pass the wall of lightning and enter this area. Thus, these two had most likely obtained all four lightning technique inheritances as well. After all, they were all supreme monarch stars, so it was only natural that they possessed such powerful comprehension ability.

However, it was rumored that all of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were in this place, so how had they passed the wall of lightning?

Perhaps those at the Ninth Heaven could pass without obstruction?

Many questions flashed through Ling Han’s mind. However, killing intent spread across his face as he said, “You two have come to seek death?”

“Wrong! We’ve come to kill you!” Xiao Yingxiong said coldly, directly retrieving his Celestial Spear.

His luck wasn’t as good as Ling Han’s, and it had taken him an extremely long time to find and obtain all four of the lightning technique inheritances. Only then could he come to this final destination. Coincidentally, he had come across Miao Hua during this process. Indeed, he truly hadn’t sought out Miao Hua on purpose.

“We’ll settle this today!” Ling Han said as he drew his Divine Demon Sword. If they left the Celestial King Graveyard, the Heavenly Venerates of the martial academy would definitely prevent them from killing each other. Thus, it was necessary to settle their differences here.

“Killing you will be as easy as killing a chicken!” Miao Hua said in contempt. He also retrieved a Celestial Staff.

Boom!

His Eighth Heaven aura was as vast as the sea.

Miao Hua had already advanced to the Eighth Heaven tens of millions of years ago, so after so many years, he had already reached the late stage of the Eighth Heaven. His battle prowess had more so soared to the late stage of the Ninth Heaven. The higher one’s cultivation level, the weaker their ability to surpass tiers. Only supreme monarch stars could remain so impressive.

Boom!

Xiao Yingxiong also unleashed his own aura. He was also at the late stage of the Eighth Heaven.

Ling Han remained unfazed as he held his Divine Demon Sword flat. He extended his left hand and made a hooking motion with his fingers. “Come at me!”

“Arrogant!” the two supreme prodigies said with a cold chuckle. They then attacked in unison.

One thrust with his spear, while the other swept with his staff. They didn’t need to cooperate. At their level, any casual attack would possess a high level of coordination.

Ling Han swung his sword and met their attacks.

Weng!

His Divine Demon Sword caught both their spear and staff. A colossal power surged over, instantly pushing his arm back. Only when his arm was about to hit his face did it finally stop.

He roared loudly as he unleashed his Body Art.

Peng!

The spear and staff were both pushed back.

Seven ribbons of iridescent light materialized around him, making him appear like a deity.

“Seventh Heaven!” Xiao Yingxiong and Miao Hua exclaimed in shock. Xiao Yingxiong was especially astonished. During his previous battle with Ling Han, Ling Han had only just advanced to the Sixth Heaven. Now, however, he was already at the Seventh Heaven!

After so many years, Xiao Yingxiong had only advanced from the early stage of the Eighth Heaven to the late stage. He hadn’t even reached the peak stage. If he wanted to advance to the Ninth Heaven, that would more so require at least 50,000,000 years—that would already be extremely quick, astonishingly quick.

Compared to Ling Han, however, was his cultivation speed not as slow as a snail?

If this trend continued, when Xiao Yingxiong advanced to the Ninth Heaven, Ling Han would also be about to advance to this level!

Xiao Yingxiong looked at Miao Hua, and said, “We can’t hold back. We definitely have to kill him today!”

“Agreed!” Miao Hua said with a nod. He glared at Ling Han as he raised the staff in his hands.

Weng, weng, weng!

Symbols lit up on the staff. “Heaven Facing Staff, Celestial Kings Bow!”

He unleashed an attack.

Boom!

The Celestial Staff slammed down. With his Ninth-Heaven battle prowess, he was able to unleash the full might of the Divine Metal. As his staff swung, a sheet of dazzling gold appeared around it. At the same time, he also unleashed a spiritual attack.

“Die!” He was the first to attack.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yingxiong stood to the side, waiting for Ling Han to expose a weakness. At that time, he would deliver the killing blow and end Ling Han’s life.

The spiritual attack ignored all sense of distance as it arrived, immediately causing Ling Han to grasp his head in pain.

“Haha!” Miao Hua roared with laughter. He was extremely confident in his spiritual attack. As long as his spiritual attack wasn’t canceled out by his opponent’s, it could easily cause his foe to suffer gripping pain in their mind, causing them to become sluggish. If his opponent were weaker, his spiritual attack could directly shatter their mind and end their life.

Ling Han had already been struck. When Miao Hua’s staff landed, Miao Hua would seize this opportunity to turn Ling Han into a pancake.

‘As simple as that?’

Confusion spread across Xiao Yingxiong’s face. He had battled with Ling Han before, with the two of them being evenly matched. However, Ling Han’s Celestial Tool was forged from Devouring Metal, which had forced him to retreat and flee.

Was Ling Han this weak?

“Be careful of trickery!” he hurriedly warned.

Miao Hua scoffed in disdain. Ling Han had already been struck by his spiritual attack, so even if he were purposefully showing a weakness, this would now be a genuine weakness. He would send Ling Han on his way.

His staff slammed down!

Ling Han suddenly raised his head, with a bolt of nine-colored lightning crackling in his left hand as he swung it toward the staff.

‘Striking a Celestial Tool with your bare hand?

‘Who do you think you are? You’re seeking death!’

Miao Hua snickered upon seeing this, and his staff continued to slam down. Even if Ling Han were trying to trick him, this would still be a case of his genius leading to his own demise.

Weng!

Ling Han’s hand had already caught the Celestial Staff.

Pa!

With the destructive power of a Celestial Tool and the fearsome might of the Ninth Heaven, Ling Han’s palm was obliterated in an instant. His Seventh Heaven physique was nowhere near powerful enough.

However, Miao Hua also shuddered involuntarily. This was because a bolt of devastating lightning had surged through the Celestial Staff and entered his body. Not only did this cause him to become numb, but his bones and internal organs were also blasted into smithereens by the lightning in an instant.

It was also at this moment that Ling Han slashed down with his sword.

He was expressionless, as if it weren’t his hand that had been shattered just then. His gaze was harrowingly cold.

“Stop!” Xiao Yingxiong roared as he hurriedly launched an attack, attempting to block Ling Han.

However, was this not too late?

Pu!

The Divine Demon Sword directly stabbed into Miao Hua’s heaYd.
