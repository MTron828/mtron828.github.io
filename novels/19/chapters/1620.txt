Chapter 1621: Another One

The Severing Mundane Tier, Dividing Soul Tier, Immortal Palace Tier, Ascending Origin Tier, and Celestial King Tier.

The Immortal Palace Tier was the third major tier of the Celestial Realm, and this was equivalent to the Heavenly Body Tier in the Immortal Realm. One could already be regarded as an elite after reaching this cultivation level.

Ling Han gazed at the child before him, and he could no longer bring himself to call him a senior. Doing so would feel far too strange. He chuckled, and said, “Don’t you have a name?”

The child puffed his chest out, and said, “I’m called the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire!” He looked as haughty and arrogant as could be.

Ling Han shot a sideways glance at him and didn’t reply. He had already fulfilled his agreement with him, and both of them had already obtained what they desired. Thus, neither of them owed the other. That being the case, he patted his hands and started to leave the cave.

However, after taking just a step, he felt a tug on his clothes. Glancing back, he saw that there was a small hand tightly gripping the corner of his clothes.

“Say, your courage hasn’t shrunken along with your size, has it? You’re too afraid to leave by yourself?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Pei! When I traveled the world before, which ancient site was I afraid to enter? You actually dare to say that I’m cowardly?!” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire wore an expression of disdain.

“Then why are you tugging on my clothes?” Ling Han asked.

“I... don’t know how to leave this place,” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire replied with an awkward expression.

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered with laughter. “You were the one who created this place, yet you’re unable to leave by yourself now?”

“Rubbish! I set this place up when I was still relatively powerful. However, my strength is only at the low extreme of the Genesis Tier now, so how can I leave?!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire said through clenched teeth. Why was this stinky brat so difficult? Couldn’t he just lead the way out when told to? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han pondered for a moment before asking, “Any guidance fees?”

‘You... How bloody avaricious!’

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire wore a surprised look. Why hadn’t he realized that this brat was such an avaricious person before?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I’m just kidding, don’t take it so seriously! However, if you truly want to thank me, I’m not against receiving some small benefits. After all, that would be your expression of gratitude.”

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire rolled his eyes in reply. Ling Han had already rendered him completely speechless.

Meanwhile, Ling Han activated his Nine Heavens Flame to ward off the darkness.

“Huh?” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was astonished upon seeing this. “Why do I feel such apprehension toward these flames? Even if I were at the peak of my powers, I still wouldn’t want to touch these flames.”

Ling Han didn’t explain. Ancestral flames were far too precious. The two of them were on relatively good terms right now, and he didn’t want this relationship to be ruined because of some treasures.

The two of them started to exit the cave. However, after making it two-thirds of the way out, Ling Han suddenly felt the rope around his waist start to tighten. As it turned out, one day had already passed, and the Empress was starting to drag him back out as per their agreement.

As such, his speed instantly became much quicker, and the child behind him started to billow in the wind like the sail of a ship.

Whoosh!

Before long, they had already arrived at the mouth of the cave.

“Huh?” A look of astonishment flashed across the Empress’ face as she saw the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire. Ling Han had entered the cave alone, yet he had now come back out with a child? This was naturally very strange. However, she could sense the powerful aura of the child, and this made her feel as if she were facing a formidable enemy.

“Oh, this young lady is truly beautiful. I’ve never seen anyone more beautiful than her, even in the Celestial Realm,” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire remarked of the Empress.

“That’s my wife; don’t stare so much!” Ling Han used his hands to cover the child’s eyes as he said this.

“She won’t lose a chunk of flesh or anything if I look at her. How stingy!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire muttered. Perhaps it was because he was too “young” right now, and this also affected his way of thinking, but he didn’t continue to stare at the stunningly beautiful Empress.

“I’ve got nothing to do anyway, so I’ll just follow you around for now. I’ll return to the Celestial Realm after I advance to the high extreme of the Genesis Tier.”

‘You’re really not holding back, are you?!’

A strange smile tugged at the corners of Ling Han’s lips, and he said, “Say, don’t regret this decision of yours in the future!” He had far too many enemies. At least, the Open Clouds Forbidden Land might come over and hunt him down at any moment. In reality, he hadn’t resolved his problems with the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, either. If they confirmed that he couldn’t attain the power of a Saint King anymore, they would definitely continue to target him.

In terms of the Celestial Realm, he had also destroyed Han Qi’s physical body. Thus, it was hard to say whether or not a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder might suddenly come to hunt him down one day.

Following him would be fraught with danger.

However, how could the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire know that Ling Han was such a troublemaker? He wore an indifferent expression upon hearing Ling Han’s remark. In any case, he was a Small Saint right now, and his battle prowess could more so rival that of a Medium Saint. Thus, how many people in the Ancient Realm would he need to be afraid of?

It would be interesting to see what expression he wore the day that a bunch of Great Saints and Saint Kings—perhaps even Severing Mundane Tier grand elders—appeared before Ling Han.

Ling Han returned to the Great Ling Empire to leave some cultivation resources for them before retrieving his Cloud Piercing Shuttle and setting off for Wood Figure Planet. Meanwhile, the Empress entered the Black Tower to continue her cultivation and comprehension. She was going to advance to the Saint Tier as quickly as she could.

Her breakthrough would definitely be an earthshattering event.

She possessed a Divine Fetus, Celestial King Tier cultivation techniques, and had also formed 10,000,000 heavenly bodies and cultivated the Regulations of the two realms. Thus, her power would reach the peak stage of the Small Saint once she broke through to the Saint Tier, and her battle prowess would also be incredible. Otherwise, it would be completely unjust to the 10,000,000 heavenly bodies that she had spent so much time and effort in forming.

As for the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, he wasn’t surprised at all that Ling Han possessed a Spatial God Tool. After all, these were far too common in the Celestial Realm. Moreover, he was clearly a lazy person as he would rather hitch a ride with the Cloud Piercing Shuttle and spend more time rather than travel by himself.

Anyhow, Ling Han also took this chance to ask him some questions. This further deepened his understanding of the Celestial Realm. The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire had been at the Immortal Palace Tier at the time, so he was quite familiar with many aspects of the Celestial Realm. However, there were also many things that he didn’t know about. This was due to the limitation of his cultivation level.

Why did so few people come to the Ancient Realm from the Celestial Realm?

After all, there were clearly vast expanses of land here. Why didn’t they conquer this land?

The answer to this was simple—the Celestial Realm itself was also boundlessly large! In the Celestial Realm, the units used to describe different forces were in terms of cities, and each of these cities was as large as a great star. In fact, some colossal cities were as large as an entire galaxy!

Thus, just the territory of the Celestial Realm was already enough for them to battle over. As such, very few people saw any value in conquering a “barren” place such as the Ancient Realm.

Moreover, why was the Celestial Realm called the Celestial Realm? This was because the Celestial Realm contained an undying divine essence. This divine essence was the key to achieving immortality. If one left this environment for too long, they would suffer an irreversible process of having their lifespan severed. Thus, even Celestials would become no different from ordinary Genesis Tier Saints.

To sacrifice one’s life for the sake of conquering some land that was next to useless? Who would do something so utterly stupid?

Indeed, those who entered the Ancient Realm were all members of the younger generation who hadn’t reached the Severing Mundane Tier yet. They needed to rely on the help of their clan to push them into the Ancient Realm. Moreover, their purpose for coming here was primarily to train. In addition to that, they would also search for the treasures that had been lost in the Ancient Realm during the great turmoil of yore.

For example, Han Qi had come for these exact purposes.

However, even the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire wasn’t aware of the reasons behind the great turmoil. According to rumors, it was instigated by the Celestial Kings, and thus only the Celestial Kings would know of the true reason.

Two years passed, and the Cloud Piercing Shuttle arrived on Wood Figure Planet.

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire had just attained rebirth, so he immediately sprinted off to explore the land. He was a Small Saint, and his battle prowess could rival that of Medium Saints. Moreover, he could easily escape and flee even if he came across a Great Saint whom he couldn’t defeat. Thus, Ling Han wasn’t worried about him at all.

“Ling Han, let me out!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden suddenly said through the Black Tower.

Ling Han let the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden out, only to suddenly discover that her aura was incredibly wild and turbulent. His expression involuntarily changed.

She was about to break through...

...to the Genesis Tier!
