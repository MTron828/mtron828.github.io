2805 Bothered beyond tolerance

Zhang Kailun felt stifled by Hu Niu’s words. He glared fiercely at Ling Han, and thought Ling Han had to be responsible for this.

“What are you looking at me like that for?” Ling Han shook his head. “Firstly, when I met Hu Niu, who knew where you were then! Secondly, you are truly a busybody, butting too much into the matters of others, aren’t you?”

Zhang Kailun was instantly half-dying from fury. He had been living for a good number of epochs, but as for Ling Han? He had only been alive for over an epoch at most. What did he mean by saying that “when I met Hu Niu, who knew where you were then”?

Why was this brat’s tone so arrogant?

!!

But Hu Niu clearly wanted to defend him, so Zhang Kailun could only be cautious in his movements, but dared not make a move.

He felt resentful. This brat was really such a freeloader.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “You are very defiant, aren’t you? Come, make your move and battle, and let me see just how capable you are?”

Zhang Kailun was practically in disbelief. A mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dared to provoke him like this?

Had he lost his senses?

Yet Hu Niu clapped her hands, and said laughingly, “Ling Han, teach this stinky Rock a good lesson!”

She had absolute confidence in Ling Han. Since Ling Han was taking the initiative to issue a challenge, he had to be sure of his chances. This was Hu Niu’s trust in Ling Han; there was no need for Ling Han to say anything at all.

Ling Han nodded. “Got it!”

Yet Zhang Kailun was extraordinarily outraged. Just to show off in front of Hu Niu, this brat had really abandoned all pride. He clenched his fist, and decided to give Ling Han a harsh beating.

For the sake of Hu Niu, he would not kill Ling Han, but he would definitely make this guy who had no measure of himself and only boasted know the meaning of respect.

Ling Han was the first to attack. Xiu! In a flash, his figure instantly appeared in front of Zhang Kailun, and threw a straight up punch towards his face.

“You are truly arrogant!!” Zhang Kailun was so infuriated that he was smiling. Such a head-on punch could only be used when both sides were equal in strength, or even when one completely overwhelmed the other. A First Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dared to make a move like this against a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate? Just how outrageously brazen was he!

Zhang Kailun also threw out a punch, wanting to give Ling Han an unforgettable lesson.

Boom!

The two men’s fists crashed into one another, immediately causing a violent surge of energy of heaven and earth. Peng, peng, peng! The space in their surroundings exploded endlessly. Thankfully, Ling Han had taken the initiative to attack first, and the two men had begun their battle in the skies. Otherwise, with the impact of the resultant shock wave, Ling City would be immediately destroyed.

“Hmm?” Zhang Kailun was stunned. The force of Ling Han’s punch had completely exceeded his expectations, reaching a level that was close to his equal. Though he was slightly inferior, he could completely consider Ling Han as an opponent of the same level.

A First Tier that was his equal? That had to be a joke.

Ling Han waved out his right arm, and Zhang Kailun was sent backwards by the impact. He slowly withdrew his fist. “How about it?”

Zhang Kailun’s expression instantly became extremely solemn. He finally knew that the praises that the Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation had for Ling Han had not been the slightest bit exaggerated. In fact, she had been tactful, probably because she had no wish to strike a blow to her disciple’s self-esteem.

A First Tier Heavenly Venerate having the battle prowess of a Third Tier; this had no precedent, and had never been seen in the past or present.

However, Zhang Kailun would not be giving up so easily.

Because not only did he like Hu Niu, he himself was also a madman that thirsted for battle.

“Come fight me!” he shouted loudly, and charged towards Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng! The two men battled fiercely.

Every single one of those who could become a Heavenly Venerate was a prodigy among prodigies, and had heaven-defying luck. There was no need to doubt that. However, there were some prodigies that were even more outstanding than the rest, and had fused the unique power of not only a single dimension so that their battle prowess would be able to suppress all their peers when they had been at the First Tier.

Firstly, this was because he himself had outstanding natural talent, and secondly, it was also related to their background. If Ling Han had not wanted to become invincible among his peers, he would not have walked the cultivation path of fusing the Power of Dimensions of all the great dimensions. Even if he could, so what? After the opportunity was missed, there would be no chance for regrets.

As for Zhang Kailun, his natural talent was unknown, but seeing as how Hu Niu had not fused more Powers of Dimensions, it could be confirmed that this line did not have this kind of cultivation method.

Hence, Zhang Kailun was only an ordinary Third Tier—in truth, there were pitifully few Heavenly Venerates that could have tier-surpassing battle prowess. After all, all those who could reach the First Tier could not be any more prodigious.

Zhang Kailun unleashed his full battle prowess, but Ling Han always had a way to deal with him. If the former used a Heavenly Venerable Seal, so would he, and if the former used a Heavenly Venerate Technique, so did he. As for Heavenly Venerate Tools, both had their own.

They fought intensely, clashing continuously for three days and nights, yet still the battle was undecided.

Finally, Zhang Kailun resolutely stopped fighting. He had already used all his Heavenly Venerable Seals, and he was going to battle another day.

The two of them had equal strength, so if Zhang Kailun wanted to leave, Ling Han would not be able to stop him.

“Ling Han, you’re amazing!” Hu Niu jumped up, and climbed onto Ling Han’s back. “Niu can’t beat this Big Rock, and it’s Niu’s Ling Han that is more awesome.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Of course.”

After several days, Zhang Kailun came again.

Nothing needed to be said; they just battled again.

The two men battled for four days, and Zhang Kailun had become smarter this time. He did not use all his ultimate moves at the first moment, dragging out the battle until the fourth day, yet the battle still ended in a draw.

He rested for a few days, and then came back for another battle.

Every time, Zhang Kailun did not get much of an upper hand, but he would make a comeback a few days after every battle.

At the beginning, Ling Han did not mind having a sparring partner. Most importantly, this guy was too stubborn. 10 times, 20 times, 30 times. It felt like Zhang Kailun was fixated on Ling Han, stuck to him like gum. He could not win the battle, but he would not lose, either, so he shamelessly refused to leave.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel depressed. If he had another letter, he would definitely smack it onto this guy. He was too annoying.

However, Zhang Kailun’s tenacity was extraordinary. Back and forth, back and forth, and 30,000 years had already passed in the blink of an eye.

By now, the people in Ling City all knew about Zhang Kailun. At the beginning, they had been a little worried. This was a Heavenly Venerate that was charging over! However, now they were used to it already. If he wanted to come, just let him come then. In any case, he would leave after fighting for a few days.

Ling Han was really close to going mad; how could there be anyone so shameless?

“Husband, why don’t we leave?” Helian Xunxue suggested.

“That’s right, that’s right. We can go to various places and eat and eat!” Hu Niu declared, clapping her hands. When she spoke of eating, her eyes were bright.

Even if she had become a Heavenly Venerate, she still had her original personality, which did not change in the slightest.

It was very easy for Ling Han to leave. He could just directly traverse the Genesis World, and go easily to whichever dimension he chose.

The women all looked towards Ling Han, all thinking that this was a good idea. Otherwise, Zhang Kailun would come and issue challenges all the time, which seriously affected the quality of their married life. For example, they had just been about to proceed with the great matter of increasing the number of members of the Ling Clan when Zhang Kailun had suddenly called out from outside, and Ling Han left.

How could that be condoned?

...

Ling Han also thought seriously. If it was really a battle of equals, suppressing Zhang Kailun would naturally be a piece of cake for him, but the problem now was that he was still a First Tier.

Furthermore, because there were too many Powers of Dimension inside his body, and he was invincible in a battle of equal cultivation levels, he would need an astonishing amount of time for every step forwards precisely for the same reason. How could he possibly improve in mere tens of thousands of years?

“I need more Heavenly Venerable Seals,” Ling Han said. Only when he obtained enough Heavenly Venerable Seals would he be able to advance his cultivation level rapidly.
