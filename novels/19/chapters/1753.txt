Chapter 1754: The ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan suffers calamity again

“Despicable brat, stop!” Ding Jun roared in fury. Every punch from Ling Han would result in the deaths of over a dozen clansmen, and there were even some among them that were his direct descendants, so how could he hold himself back from going crazy?

He leaped out, launching an offensive at Ling Han.

“Grand Elder is mighty!”

“Grand Elder is dominating!”

“Destroy this criminal!”

The surviving members of the Ding Clan all shouted loudly. There had never been anyone that dared to enter into the Ding Clan Manor alone and start a massacre like this.

Ding Jun charged over, and used a secret technique of time that could age all attacks. This way, he could take advantage of the opening and kill his opponent. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ling Han’s eyes turned even colder, and he declared, “Today, I will get justice for the Hu Clan!”

Weng, this was like a bolt of lightning out of the blue, causing Ding Jun’s head to go numb from the shock. He exclaimed, “So you are one of the surviving dregs of the Hu Clan!”

No wonder Ling Han had always opposed the Ding Clan, and had even drawn the Han Clan, which was completely unrelated, to them, causing the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan to be destroyed. As it turned out, Ling Han was actually a descendant of the Hu Clan!

All this finally had a logical explanation.

Yet Ling Han did not intend to clarify things. Since Ding Jun had misunderstood, he would just let it be. In any case, he was here to commit murder.

When he made his move, it did not appear to be very fast, yet he forced his way through Ding Jun’s offensive, and grabbed the latter’s neck in a single move.

The neck of a great first severance grand elder was held like he was a duck being grabbed for slaughter, his limbs struggling helplessly.

This gap in strength was as wide as the distance between heaven and earth!

Ling Han used his other hand to grab onto Ding Jun’s neck as well, and with a twist, a cracking sound was heard, and Ding Jun’s neck was broken. Pu, a fountain of blood sprayed out, and the old guy’s limbs drooped suddenly as he came to look like a dead dog.

He was indeed dead. The vitality in his physical body had been eliminated, and even his spirit had been destroyed by Ling Han’s power of Regulation. He did not even have the chance to escape from his physical body.

Ling Han threw Ding Jun’s body to the side with a casual toss. Of course, he did not forget to frisk the latter for items like any Spatial God Tools first.

A dead silence enveloped the surroundings.

Grand Elder Ding Jun was dead, not even being able to survive a single blow from Ling Han. Killing him had been as easy as slaughtering a dog or killing a chicken.

That was a first severance grand elder!

Everyone’s legs began to shake wildly. They wanted to flee, but felt as if their legs were stuck in cement, and they could not even move a single muscle.

Ling Han did not give them any mercy. As he shot out a punch, over a dozen people suddenly exploded, both their form and spirit destroyed.

“Spare us!” Some who were weak-willed immediately knelt down to beg Ling Han for mercy.

“You disdainful descendants, don’t beg for mercy from this executioner. Do you think that he would spare us just because of this?” There were some who had stronger backbone, and stood there with their heads held high, glaring steadily at Ling Han as if they were determined to remember his face. Even after death, they would turn into ghosts and avenge themselves.

How could Ling Han possibly be concerned? Today, there was only one thing he was going to bring to the Ding Clan, and that was death.

Wherever he passed, all members of the Ding Clan would be killed.

Ling Han and the Empress continued onwards. He was unfamiliar with the Ding Clan Manor. Thus, he naturally headed to the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan. He was familiar with that place.

“Despicable brat!”

“Quick, go and inform Lord Patriarch!”

“Aaah!”

Wherever Ling Han passed, he would not leave a single person alive. He had seen too much. There was not a single good person in the Ding Clan at all. Something like mercy was really too much of a luxury for the Ding Clan.

Over two hours later, Ling Han and the Empress arrived at the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan.

Two years had already passed, so the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan had naturally been completely rebuilt. It was lavish and glorious, and still appeared so dignified and austere.

“A bunch of evil villains, doing evil while you were alive, and can be worshipped and enjoy the incense from your descendants even while dead?” Ling Han smirked coldly. He shot out a fist, and began his destruction.

There was a legend in the Celestial Realm: if one had died, and his memorial tablet was built, and received worship and incense, then that person’s spirit would reform and would be reincarnated among the descendants of his bloodline once enough time had passed!

If this succeeded, this bloodline descendant would be able to easily reach the height that that person had reached when he had been alive, and for a clan, the significance of this was extraordinary.

Moreover, this also satisfied the desire for eternal life. After all, there was still the matter of the Immortal’s Tribulation. In fact, there were not many elites that could really attain eternal life in the Celestial Realm. There were only a great many old monsters who had lived chillingly long lives.

The Ding Clan had built this ancestral shrine in hopes that those old ancestors could reform their souls, and come back to life among their descendants, adding more elites to the ranks of the Ding Clan.

They were villains that had died so many years ago, and they still wanted to come back to life and commit evil once more?

Of course it was not to be allowed!

Ling Han used his full strength. Hong, long, long, the whole ancestral shrine shook madly, but it was not destroyed for the moment.

That was because there was a protective formation guarding this place, and Ling Han wasn’t a fourth severance elite the likes of Han Lu, so his destructive power could not compare. However, he immediately used the Nine Heavens Flame, Xuanyin Source Water, and power of lightning, and this destructive power was very frightening.

Especially in the case of the Nine Heavens Flame and the Xuanyin Source Water. Their might could not be measured in terms of cultivation level. As long as they made contact with the target, the great dao would show its power, and everything would be destroyed!

Actually, the power of lightning was also very terrifying. It was the strongest power of the Immortal Realm, but an upper limit was placed on its might in the Ancient Realm. However, after Ling Han had entered into the Celestial Realm, this upper limit was released, and its might was really extraordinarily powerful.

From a certain aspect, this power of lightning was also born from heaven and earth, and in truth, it could also be considered a Source Power.

“The memorial tablets of the ancestors!”

“Just what sin has our Ding Clan committed to deserve this!”

A great many elders that were paying their respects in the ancestral shrine were all sobbing as they exclaimed. They had all run out and turned furious glares on Ling Han. If looks could kill, Ling Han would definitely have been torn into pieces.

“Brat!” A roar of anger rang out, and another elite had finally arrived.

Ding Shuang, first severance grand elder.

He was a very outstanding clansman of the Ding Clan. He had advanced at a very early age, and thus he looked to be only in his forties, his vitality as expansive as an ocean. He shouted loudly, and the vitality around him rippled as if he was a Demon King that had emerged from obscurity, maintaining a threatening manner.

Ding Xiaochen had also appeared. He was staring at his foe, Ling Han, with a dumbfounded look. He really did not know how to describe his present feelings.

The strength of this enemy had already reached a level that he could only look up to. He only dared keep his hatred in his heart, yet did not even dare to show a slight inkling of it. He had already repeatedly suffered punishment at Ling Han’s hands, so he did not even dare to have a temper anymore.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s mind, and he softly exclaimed, “Battle Beast, appear!”

Suddenly, three streaks of light surged out from within his body.

The white light formed into a tiger, the red light formed into a bird, and the blue light was a Thunder Beast.

Ten Beasts Technique, the core celestial technique of the Multitude Beasts Celestial King!

After so many days, he had slightly grasped some of the profound mysteries of the Ten Beasts Technique, and could form three Battle Beasts, which respectively had the Nine Heavens Flame, Xuanyin Source Water, and Heavenly Tribulation’s Lightning as their cores. He was going to try out the might of these three Battle Beasts.

The moment these three Battle Beasts appeared, their murderous aura suddenly soared. Some people who were more cowardly were so terrified that they were beginning to throw up from fear.

Ding Shuang had also paled in shock. He had a feeling that even he would be easily killed if any one of these Battle Beasts attacked him.

How was this possible?

He looked at Ling Han for a while longer, and a powerful astonishment involuntarily appeared in his expression. “Severing Mundane Tier! Y-y-y-y-y-you actually advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier!”

The heavens were blind! Such a bastard that should be killed 100 times over had actually advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier!
