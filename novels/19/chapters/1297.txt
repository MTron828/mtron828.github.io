Chapter 1298 Gathering of Prodigies

The Mountain River Forest was the location of the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering.

However, not everyone could enter this place. In fact, it was quite the contrary. Whether or not one could enter the Mountain River Forest was the first test, and this was a test that would eliminate many who believed that they were prodigies. Only true prodigies could enter.

This was a vast land, yet it was shrouded by the Regulations of heaven and earth all year round, preventing anyone from setting foot inside. Even Saints were no exception to this.

Every 77,777 years, the Regulations would undergo a peculiar change that made it non-lethal. However, such a change would only last for a mere 15 days. Even so, the fact still remained that only the most brilliant of prodigies would have the right to enter. The Regulations of heaven and earth would become non-lethal, but entering the Mountain River Forest would still be an impossible task for ordinary cultivators.

Similarly, the Regulations enveloping the Sun Moon Valley would also undergo change once every 77,777 years. However, this would occur 33,333 years after the Mountain River Forest. Thus, the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering would be held at the Mountain River Forest first, then at the Sun Moon Valley 33,333 years later. After 44,444 years, the gathering would return to the Mountain River Forest.

Because such a gathering was only held once in tens of thousands of years, the prodigies from both the realms treated it with extreme importance. Not only could they compete against prodigies from another realm, but they could even compete against prodigies from their own realm.

Take, for example, Faceless. Under normal circumstances, would he come to the Cloud Apex Planet for no reason?

The clash between the prodigies from the two realms could, to a certain degree, reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each realm. This was also part of the reason why the higher-ups of the two realms encouraged the prodigies from their realm to attend the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering. Those who achieved outstanding results could even receive rich rewards.

In truth, Ling Han’s motivation for attending this gathering was in large part due to these rich rewards.

The two Imperial Empires had released a joint announcement, promising a reward of a Level 10 Godly metal if one could win first place for the Immortal Realm.

From Level Nine onwards, Godly metal was extremely scarce and hard to obtain. If Ling Han wanted to elevate his Divine Demon Sword to the Celestial Level, each piece of Godly metal would be of utmost importance. Right now, his only wish was that the Divine Demon Sword could become slightly less “gluttonous” in the future.

Although the Mountain River Forest was called a forest, there was only one point of entry. Moreover, this entrance was a canyon.

Right now, this canyon was still sealed off by the Regulations of heaven and earth. As such, no one was able to enter. In a few days, the Regulations of heaven and earth would gradually open up, allowing those who possessed extraordinary talent to enter. If one wasn’t a supreme prodigy, all they could do was gaze at the canyon and sigh.

In any case, this canyon was extremely difficult to cross. If one stubbornly pushed themselves beyond their limit, it was entirely possible that they would end up dead.

Because there were only a few days left until the Regulations opened up, there were already mountains of people gathered here. Some had come to attend the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering, while others had come to witness a spectacle. This was an event that they could brag about for hundreds of years to come.

Everyone here was an Immortal as well, so the weather didn’t bother them a single bit, be it rain, hail, or shine. They remained sitting or standing as they patiently waited for the Regulations to open up.

The Regulations here were extremely strange, and it was as if the Netherworld and Immortal Realm were fused together flawlessly. Everyone could channel their own cultivation technique without restriction, regardless of whether they were from the Netherworld or Immortal Realm. Thus, battling in the Mountain River Forest and Sun Moon Valley would be extremely fair. If one lost, they couldn’t use location as an excuse.

Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden sat next to each other, appearing especially low-key. Meanwhile, the old ginseng had already run off to cause mischief among the women. As for Rabbit, his eyes were set on others’ fanny packs. If he detected any valuable medicine inside of them, he would definitely seize an opportunity to grab them, even if it meant tailing his victim for several days on end.

Only the freshly hatched Azure Flame Vulture was relatively well-behaved. It stood behind Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, spreading its wings from time to time to groom its feathers. It appeared extremely magnificent, and it exuded a slight air of pride.

Ling Han named it “Little Qing”. In any case, those who followed him were all his juniors anyway.

“I’ve heard that even Yang Lin will attend this time!”

“Gasp! For real?”

“Who’s Yang Lin?”

“It can’t be, right? You don’t even know who Yang Lin is? He’s the number one prodigy of the Plentiful Planet! People refer to him as the Invincible King Tier, and he’s a personal disciple of the Nine River Venerate. Not only that, but it’s even rumored that he had an extraordinary encounter and obtained a damaged Saint Tool!”

“Pu...! Saint Tool!”

“Of course, Yang Lin is truly blessed by the fortune of heaven. That Saint Tool actually recognized him as its master! Although it’s damaged, it still possesses a terrifying might. I’ve heard that it’s on par with elites at the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier and can even suppress elites at the low extreme!”

“Don’t forget that Yang Lin is only at the Sun Moon Tier right now. Once he advances to the Heavenly Body Tier, perhaps he’ll even be able to suppress Eternal River Tier elites!”

“Gasp! Such a terrifying person actually exists?”

“But if he obtained a Saint Tool, why didn’t other elites try to snatch it off him?”

“Yeah, why didn’t they? There’s no way Eternal River Tier elites would have been afraid of him, right?”

“Pei! Do you people understand what a Saint Tool is? If a Saint Tool is uninterested in you, what will it matter even if you’re an Eternal River Tier elite? Would you be able to subdue the Saint Tool? Even if one does manage to kill Yang Lin, they’ll still come up empty-handed. Not only that, but they would have offended the Nine River Venerate as well!”

“That’s right. The Nine River Venerate is extremely scary. According to rumors, he’s already at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. Moreover, he’s currently cultivating toward the Genesis Tier. Even if we cast our gaze over the entire Long Light Galaxy, such kinds of supreme elites definitely won’t number more than 10!”

Everyone nodded in agreement. Apart from a select few people, even elites at the Eternal River Tier wouldn’t dare to target Yang Lin. In any case, those who possessed such formidable power and were cultivating toward the Genesis Tier wouldn’t be interested in a damaged Saint Tool anyway.

Once they successfully advanced to the Genesis Tier, they would have the ability to forge Saint Tools themselves.

Ling Han was also listening to this conversation, and he committed Yang Lin’s name to memory.

‘Yang Lin... He’s most likely a formidable opponent who’s on the same level as Faceless.’

“Given what you’ve all said, I gather that Yang Lin will suppress the prodigies of both realms and emerge as the king among kings?”

“Not necessarily!

“I’ve heard that the White Horse Planet’s Thousand Peak Imperial Empire also has a super genius. This super-genius is the only child of the Imperial Emperor, and her name is ‘Cloud’. She’s only cultivated for 200 years, yet she’s already reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier!”

“Yes, that’s right, I’ve also heard about her. People often refer to her as the Cloud Maiden. Ever since she started cultivating, she’s participated in 376 battles with zero losses. Not only that, but all of her opponents had a huge advantage in cultivation level!”

“Hehe, don’t forget guys, we also have a young king tier on our Cloud Apex Planet.”

“Ling Han!”

“Pei! Who’s Ling Han? Is he worthy of being mentioned alongside these other king tiers? The young king tier I was referring to is the Blue Cloud Imperial Empire’s Yue Ying!”

“Yue Ying is indeed worthy of being labeled as a young king tier. She’s invincible among those of her generation and also among those at the same cultivation level. She genuinely possesses an aura of invincibility.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Guys, don’t underestimate Ling Han!” The person who had suggested Ling Han’s name was unwilling to back down, and he continued, “I’ve heard people say that he was attacked by the combined forces of the Heaven’s Sword Sect, Earth Dragon Sect, and other members of the Five Sects. Yet, they were all defeated and pushed back by him! He definitely deserves a spot next to the other young king tiers!”

“Pffft, what kind of trashy force is the Heaven’s Sword Palace?” someone asked in disdain. “They don’t even have a single Heavenly Body Tier elite. So what if he was able to defeat them?”

“Haha! Tie Qi, if you’re so able, why don’t you also head over to defeat the Five Sects?” someone in the crowd teased.

Everyone shook their heads. The strength of Yang Lin, the Cloud Maiden, and Yue Ying was publicly acknowledged. However, who was Ling Han? He was a new prodigy at most, and perhaps he could genuinely make a name for himself at the Sun Moon Valley gathering 44,444 years later. However, now was evidently not the time for him to shine.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stood up, and said, “If anyone thinks that Ling Han isn’t powerful enough, I’m willing to witness their strength!”
