Chapter 1041: Fast Technique

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was in no hurry to leave, so he stayed in the Black Tower to practice his newly learned sword technique.

One day, two days, three days...

“The Regulations are broken, and that’s the reason the speed of this technique can increase without limits. Those who face this sword technique have no chance of dodging it,” Ling Han murmured to himself as his body flew through the air and his sword slashed down.

His sword was as quick as lightning as he dashed forward, yet he immediately felt a pang of pain shoot through his left leg. Lowering his head, he was shocked to discover that his left foot was still planted in its original location. His toes were all broken, and some were even twisted at unnatural angles.

“Gasp! Is this the consequence of breaking the Regulations?”

Ling Han grimaced as he hurriedly reattached his left foot. He channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and healed the wound.

‘I took the wrong path. Although the speed of my sword was quicker, the damage to my body was even greater.

‘However, this is partly because I’m in the Black Tower, where my power is magnified immensely. If I were outside, I definitely wouldn’t have been able to twist my bones to such a degree.

‘I can’t practice here. I have to go out first.’

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and immediately discovered that the devastating water pressure had already disappeared.

In fact, it was somewhat wrong to say that it had disappeared. After all, the sea would naturally have some pressure at great depths. However, such pressure was like weightless fog to him right now, and it was completely unable to affect his Godly bones.

‘Huh? If that’s the case, will I be able to use my Flight God Tool as well?’

Ling Han retrieved the Cloud Piercing Shuttle and tried to steer it. Sure enough, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle split through the currents and arrived at the surface of the sea after a mere few seconds. It then shot into the sky.

‘As expected!’

Ling Han let Shui Yanyu out, and told her about what had just happened.

“Invincible Sword Saint?” Shui Yanyu was baffled. It was clear that she had never heard of this name before.

This wasn’t surprising. Right now, the strongest cultivators on the Joint Peace Planet were only at the Heavenly Body Tier. Perhaps there had been an ancient era when cultivation had prospered and great elites at the Genesis Tier existed. However, the cultivation environment on the Joint Peace Planet was nowhere near as prosperous right now.

Time could destroy everything, and even great elites at the Genesis Tier couldn’t escape the test of time.

“It’s a pity that you’re probably unable to learn this sword technique,” Ling Han said with a sigh.

He wasn’t a selfish person, and would definitely share such benefits with his friends and family.

“Who said I can’t learn it!” Shui Yanyu said proudly.

Ling Han chuckled, and steered the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to a small island. He decided to camp here and master the Fast Technique first. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He examined the Fast Technique with Shui Yanyu, yet she was at a complete loss, unable to make any sense of the technique.

In fact, Ling Han was also baffled, though the Demonic Power Source in his Dantian would release some mystical power and help him overcome any problems and barriers that he came across.

This was the Regulation of Heaven and Earth corresponding to the Genesis Tier.

It was impossible for Ling Han to comprehend the technique by himself, yet with the aid of the Demonic Power Source, he was able to slowly master the Fast Technique. It was as if the comprehensions were being slowly forced into his brain.

Thus, in theory, he lacked the ability to practice this technique. However, even the heavens had helped him, with the jade box coincidentally landing right where the Demon Master rested. Meanwhile, his Black Tower was able to suppress the essence of the Demon Master, and he was more so cultivating the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. It was due to all of these conditions being satisfied that he was able to succeed.

Even so, the pace of Ling Han’s improvement was still as slow as a snail crawl.

Ling Han felt extremely uncomfortable when he wielded his sword, with his hand, feet, waist, and every other part of his body all twisted at an angle that made it hard to apply strength. Anyhow, “strange” couldn’t begin to describe how this technique felt.

He slowly overcame these problems, and the speed of his sword became faster and faster.

However, the faster his sword became, the more burden was placed on his body. His Godly bones would creak and groan with every strike that he performed, and if it were Shui Yanyu who was performing them, all of her bones would definitely be shattered.

“So fast!” Shui Yanyu witnessed Ling Han’s improvement, with the speed of his sword becoming quicker with each passing day. In the beginning, she could still follow Ling Han’s sword light with her eyes. Now, however, she couldn’t follow it at all.

His hand would move, and his sword would instantly reach its target.

That was how unbelievably quick it was.

‘No wonder he was called the Invincible Sword Saint. This kind of sword technique simply defies nature.’

“This is only one form of the Four Form Sword Technique. How powerful is the Slow Technique, Chaotic Technique, and Calm Technique?” Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were both extremely intrigued.

After a month of practice, Ling Han finally attained small accomplishment in the Fast Technique. At the same time, he had also managed to advance to the middle stage of the medium extreme thanks to the help of the Demonic Power Source. In addition to that, he also used some spare time to practice his alchemy, finally succeeding in refining the Heavenly Pearl Pill.

“Let’s go and kill some more pirates,” Ling Han said with a laugh. After mastering the sword technique, he naturally had to improve his skills through battle.

They rode on the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, unafraid of coming across Sun Moon Tier elites. After all, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle was fast enough for them to escape.

The change in the Star Sea didn’t affect the Yang Clan’s business. In fact, it was quite the contrary, with their business thriving even more. Following the disappearance of the extreme gravity field, more and more people ventured to the Star Sea to search for treasures.

In the past, one had to be at the Mountain River Tier if they wanted to dive into the sea. Now, however, even those at the Shattering Void Tier and Heaven Tier were able to dive into the sea. A depth of 3,000 meters posed absolutely no threat to them. Of course, the Demonic Beasts in the sea were still a huge threat. If one were to die in the mouth of a Demonic Beast while searching for treasures, they would only be able to blame it on their terrible luck.

Without the disturbance of the Demon Master, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle was able to operate at its peak. Even if they wanted to circle the entire sea, it would only take them a day at most.

As they had drifted in the sea for a few days after being shipwrecked, Ling Han had managed to learn a lot about the Yang Clan’s sea routes from Yang Tiecheng. Right now, he was also steering the Cloud Piercing Shuttle along those exact routes.

“There!” He brought the shuttle down near a large ship that was currently engaged in an intense battle.

It was a large ship owned by the Yang Clan, guarded by an elite at the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, the pirates had naturally sent an elite at the same cultivation level. Right now, they were fighting a fierce battle on the surface of the sea.

This would have been impossible in the past. However, without the extreme gravity field, how difficult would it be for Sun Moon Tier elites to walk across the sea? If they advanced one more tier, they would be able to soar through the sky!

Ling Han stored the shuttle away and entered the battlefield with Shui Yanyu, both of them launching ferocious attacks at the pirates.

The battle was extremely chaotic, so they didn’t attract the attention of any elites even though they had drawn the attention of some people when they had descended from the sky. Moreover, their cultivation levels were far too low, so they could be easily killed no matter which side they belonged to.

“Die, brat!” A pirate immediately charged over with his saber. He was an elite at the peak stage of the medium extreme, so he charged over without any fears, fully confident that his advantage in cultivation level would allow him to easily crush Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he activated the Fast Technique.

Pa!

The pirate swung his saber, yet he was shocked to discover that his arm had already been severed from his body. He then saw his body separate into several pieces... He had actually been dismembered in a fraction of a second!

Only then did he come to his senses. ‘How come I can see myself being dismembered into several pieces? Could it be that I’ve already been decapitated? When did this happen? I didn’t see him move at all!’

These were the last thoughts that flashed through the pirate’s mind.
