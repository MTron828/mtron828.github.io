2728 The battle starts

Ling Han scratched his head. What was wrong with him being the number one on the recent leaderboard? Could this also draw aggravation?

“Gou Yan,” Gou Yan introduced himself. “My ranking is not as high as yours. I am only ranked 89th on the recent leaderboard.”

Well, duh. The people who could take the field today were the top 100 elites on the recent leaderboard, and only 28 people were outsiders. Still, being able to obtain such a qualification, one had to have extraordinary strength.

He looked at Ling Han loftily; so what if he was ranked 89th? Just wait and see how he would thrash Ling Han later.

!!

The leaderboard of battle merits wasn’t a Battle Roll or Strength Roll, but it was still a reflection of every person’s strength to a great extent—if one wasn’t strong enough, how could one kill so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?

Therefore, Ling Han, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, being ranked first made all the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates on the leaderboard extremely unhappy.

‘F***, what have I done to offend you?’

Ling Han was extremely unhappy.

‘This is just a sparring match, is there a need for you to bear such great enmity towards me?

‘Fine, then I’ll beat the crap out of you, and let you enjoy it to the fullest.’

“Ranked 89th? Haha.” Ling Han’s face was full of disdain. “How many of my moves can you block?”

“A puny Ninth Heaven Celestial King, merely being a lucky bastard, you think you can be arrogant with me?” Gou Yan’s face darkened. He didn’t believe the previous “rumors” that Ling Han could actually fight against more than 20 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Wasn’t this a joke?

Even an elite like himself could only contend against five Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates at most, and these had to be people who weren’t on the recent leaderboard, or two would be overwhelming enough.

One fighting against 20, and furthermore, he was merely a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

“I will teach you how to behave properly!” Ling Han rushed out, and peng, he immediately burst forth at a terrifyingly high speed with a tap of his foot.

“The light of fireflies is also worthy of competing with the sun and the moon?” Gou Yan grabbed a streak of great dao with his left hand, while his right hand balled into a fist, and he blasted it towards Ling Han.

In the “Minor Skill Demonstration,” contestants were allowed to use Celestial Tools, but were not allowed to use supreme precious tools.

This wasn’t intentionally targeting Ling Han, but it was for the sake of fairness. Otherwise, those descendants of Heavenly Venerates would go and borrow precious tools from their elders, and then it wouldn’t be their battle, but rather a competition of strength among the Heavenly Venerates that supported them.

Since Ling Han couldn’t use the Divine Demon Sword, he didn’t plan on using any Celestial Tool, either, as his power after using the Heavenly Venerate Technique was even stronger.

Peng!

Gou Yan grabbed a streak of great dao and smashed it towards Ling Han, but the latter didn’t pay any attention to it. He was instantly hit on the head by it, but it only managed to slow down Ling Han slightly.

But at this moment, Gou Yan’s fist also struck towards Ling Han.

Ling Han also threw a punch, to counter the attack.

Boom!

The intense clash led to a big explosion.

Fortunately, their battle was carried out in a barren field. This place would be ravaged by Hysteria’s army every few years, so it had already become a desolate ground, without any other living creatures. Hence, there was no need to be afraid of harming innocent people.

Those who were watching the battle stood far away, and of course there were also people with extraordinary confidence who came to the front, thinking that they could not be injured by the aftermath of the battle.

Ling Han and Gou Yan were seen to retreat more than 50 km from one another, and it seemed that there was hardly any difference between the two of them.

This blow also made Ling Han understand that Gou Yan had already reached the peak of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

He understood it very well, but Gou Yan couldn’t accept that he could only fight to a draw with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Gasp!

Could it be that the rumors weren’t just rumors? This thought crossed Gou Yan’s mind, but now it was already too late to delve into this issue, as he was already facing Ling Han.

What he needed to consider now would be how to win against his opponent.

“Rapid Wave Fist!” Guo Yan yelled lightly, and rushed towards Ling Han. 100 km was only the matter of a single step, and xiu, he appeared in front of Ling Han, and threw a punch.

This punch was extremely domineering, with the aura of Primal Chaos descending, and the brilliance of the sun and moon circulating. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Peng, peng, peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han raised his fist to counter the attack, but he was shocked to realize that Gou Yan had thrown 19 punches!

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were all excellent in Body Art. It was not a big deal to throw tens of thousands of punches in an instant. However, Ling Han’s punch was already fast enough, but when he threw a single punch, his opponent had actually thrown 19 punches. This was incredible indeed.

Was his Body Art weaker than that of Gou Yan? This was obviously impossible, otherwise the two of them couldn’t have fought each other to a draw.

Then there could only be one reason: the other party had used a secret technique!

This was by no means an ordinary secret technique, but one that was at the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier, otherwise… Ling Han would not have been injured.

Ling Han lifted his hand. He saw that his palm was split open, with blood oozing out. Furthermore, the healing speed was astonishingly slow.

His body was like Divine Metal, and even the power of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could only hurt him at most, but he would recover immediately afterward. However, now that the wound was healing so slowly, there could naturally only be one possibility—the opponent had used a Heavenly Venerate Technique, which was then capable of causing such terrible damage.

Having established his might with a single strike, Gou Yan actually turned solemn instead of expressing delight.

Ling Han’s domineering physique shocked him. He himself had used a Heavenly Venerate Technique; if the opponent hadn’t similarly used a Heavenly Venerate Technique to counter it, Gou Yan would have been seriously injured without a doubt.

But now, Ling Han’s injuries were too light, which was inconceivable to Gou Yan, and he found it unacceptable.

“How interesting.” Ling Han nodded, and launched a counterattack at Gou Yan. “Then, I will also let you have a taste of my fist!”

He swung his fist, and there was nine-colored lightning crackling on his fist—this was also a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

Peng!

Not to be outdone, Gou Yan swung his fist in return.

This exchange of blows was even more terrifying. Two people with battle prowess of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier used ultimate moves, which resulted in their battle prowess instantly soaring to the level of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

They kept exchanging blows, both wanting to use the greatest force at their disposal to make their opponent bow down.

The problem was that no one could endlessly use a Heavenly Venerate Technique.

Soon, Ling Han could no longer use the Five Elements Lightning Technique, and the same was true for Gou Yan as his domineering Rapid Wave Fist Technique could no longer be used.

Ling Han smiled, and switched to using the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.

It was basically impossible for the Heavenly Venerate Technique to be mastered by a non-Heavenly Venerate, and the same was true for Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

Therefore, unless it was like Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and Five Elements Lightning Technique, which was split into parts by prodigies, and subsequently reassembled to be mastered by Celestial Kings and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, it could only be passed down as an inheritance, like the Black Tower.

Therefore, although Gou Yan had an elder who was a Heavenly Venerate, through whom he had learned a Heavenly Venerate Technique by secret transmission, what if he still wanted to learn a second one?

He shouldn’t even think about it.

Peng!

As soon as he countered Ling Han’s punch, his expression immediately changed drastically.

How could this blow be so strong?

He had not even finished the thought when he was sent flying. All he could feel was that his entire arm had gone numb, and perhaps even his bones were broken.

He was overwhelmed with shock, and felt it was even more inconceivable. How could Ling Han’s strength suddenly increase so much?

“You, you have actually mastered two Heavenly Venerate Techniques!” Realization finally dawned on him, but his face was still filled with shock.

Though there were many Heavenly Venerates in the Flaming Frost Realm now, a Heavenly Venerate Technique was also the trump card of every Heavenly Venerate, so how could it be easily passed on to outsiders? Therefore, it was very rare for one person to possess two Heavenly Venerate Techniques.

“That’s correct!” Ling Han rushed over again, swinging both his fists continuously, each move boosted with the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.

Faced with such an attack, Gou Yan was powerless to resist, so he was being bombarded until he vomited blood unceasingly. He had no choice but to admit defeat and surrender.

Ling Han won the first battle.

After this battle, Ling Han’s strength was finally acknowledged by all. He had struck Gou Yan, who was ranked 89th on the recent leaderboard, until the latter conceded defeat—was this still not regarded as strong?
