Chapter 1333 Killing Him With My Own Hands

“I’m not lying! There’s truly a clan marking inscribed on my divine sense. This marking guards the secret technique of the Xie Clan, and it’ll automatically shatter if anyone attempts to force me to reveal the secret technique. At the same time, it’ll also notify the elites of the Xie Clan and reveal to them who was trying to dig information from me!”

Xie Donglai was extremely flustered, and he continued, “If you kill me, the consequences will also be the same!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You’re facing heavenly tribulation right now, so if I kill you, the elites of the Xie Clan will only think that you’re a fool who can’t even withstand his own heavenly tribulation!”

‘This...!’ Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xie Donglai’s face instantly started to twitch. This was entirely possible!

‘Gasp! Is this why Ling Han isn’t backing down? He wants to give me severe wounds so that I’ll eventually die by my own heavenly tribulation?

‘How detestable!’

Xie Donglai suddenly turned around. He was going to flee!

“You think you can escape?” Ling Han aggressively attacked Xie Donglai, preventing him from escaping. With Xie Donglai weakened by heaven’s might, Ling Han enjoyed an overwhelming advantage.

Xie Donglai frenziedly tried to escape. He didn’t want to die. Countless attacks rained down on Ling Han as he fought with his life on the line. In fact, he even combusted his battle prowess and sacrificed his lifespan in order to raise his battle prowess back to its original level. Otherwise, there was simply no way he could escape from Ling Han’s clutches.

Meanwhile, Ling Han activated the Tide of the Ages. Now was a good time to test the might of this secret technique.

Xie Donglai’s attack swept over, yet Ling Han stood proud and unmoving.

Xie Donglai was deeply astonished. According to his estimate, this attack should have sent Ling Han flying, giving him the opportunity to break free from his grasp and escape. As long as he could return to the grand elder’s side, only a rare few people in the world would possess the ability to kill him. Ling Han definitely wasn’t one of these people.

However, how was Ling Han not sent flying?

“Die!” Ling Han’s fist hammered over, and it was as if the sky were about to shatter.

Peng!

Xie Donglai’s left shoulder instantly exploded into pieces. Only a sliver of his left arm remained connected to his shoulder, yet even this sliver of flesh looked like it would fall off at any moment.

“How many more strikes can you withstand?” Ling Han continued to launch a flurry of punches at Xie Donglai.

Peng, peng, peng!

Under his heavy strikes, even heaven and earth started to shake. However, all of this commotion was concealed by heavenly tribulation. Even if someone happened to pass by, they would be completely oblivious to the fact that a bloody battle was occurring inside heavenly tribulation, unless they witnessed it with their own eyes.

Of course, this battle couldn’t be called a bloody battle anymore. After all, it was now a one-sided affair with Ling Han belting Xie Donglai.

Xie Donglai was drenched in blood, barely any part of his body still intact. His vitality had also dropped to a dangerously low level. There was already no need for Ling Han to attack him anymore. As long as he was struck by a few more bolts of divine lightning from heavenly tribulation, he would be laid to rest in this place forever.

Xie Donglai was boiling with resentment. Ling Han was clearly his killer, yet only he would know this. After he died, Ling Han could leave this place casually. In fact, he could even appear before Xie Qian without a worry in the world.

It was at this moment that Ling Han stopped his attacks, turning around to leave.

“Aaaah!” Xie Donglai roared in fury. Right now, even his heart was crying tears of blood. He was dying for nothing!

However, there was suddenly a blur before his eyes as a figure rapidly dashed over, throwing a punch into his chest. Under the devastating power of the strike, his divine sense crumbled like broken tiles.

It was Ling Han!

Xie Donglai’s eyes were filled with disbelief. Why had Ling Han suddenly returned to deal the killing blow? He could feel the marking in his mind fracturing. Once it shattered apart, that would mark the moment of his death. Meanwhile, the last moments that he witnessed and the last feelings that he experienced would all be transmitted to the minds of the Heavenly Body Tier elites of the Xie Clan.

Almost every single Eternal River Tier force possessed this kind of technique. The members of these forces would all have a marking engraved into their divine sense at birth. First of all, this marking would represent their identity as a member of the force. Second of all, this marking would protect the secret techniques of these forces, preventing them from being revealed. Third of all, this marking would act as a deterrent—if one dared to harm members of these forces, their identity would be revealed, and they would be hunted until they were killed!

Thus, Eternal River Tier forces enjoyed a transcendent status. Successors of Eternal River Tier elites could also act wantonly, with no one daring to kill them.

However, Ling Han actually dared to kill him? He actually dared to reveal his identity to the Xie Clan? One had to realize that there was already no need for him to return and kill him. heavenly tribulation would have killed Xie Donglai.

“You thought that I wouldn’t kill you with my own hands?” Ling Han said as he stared into Xie Donglai’s eyes. Ever since deciding to kill Xie Donglai, it was already inevitable that Xie Donglai would have to die by his hands, not by the hands of heavenly tribulation.

He could only vent his anger if he killed Xie Donglai with his own hands!

Xie Donglai stared at Ling Han with a stunned expression. At this moment, he didn’t know whether to call Ling Han crazy or to admire his courage. Anyhow, none of this mattered anymore. He was about to die.

“I’ll be waiting for you. In a dozen seconds at most, you’ll come to accompany me!” With his last breath, he spat one final sentence.

Ling Han threw his fist over.

Pa!

Xie Donglai was smashed into smithereens. His bones and flesh disintegrated into dust, and his divine sense also turned into dust. A strange fluctuation surged out, instantly traveling a boundless distance. It was as if this fluctuation could disregard space.

The heavenly tribulation that belonged to Xie Donglai quickly disappeared. Meanwhile, a strong sense of danger gripped at Ling Han’s heart. A divine sense had locked onto him.

‘It’s far too powerful!’

The owner of this divine sense was definitely thousands of kilometers away, perhaps even further. However, their divine sense had surged over and locked onto him, capable of killing him with a single thought.

‘This is... the power of an Eternal River Tier elite!’

This was the divine sense of Xie Qian, the grand elder of the Xie Clan, a Great General of the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire, and an elite at the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier! To say nothing Ling Han, even the Venerable Trinity would be insta-killed by Xie Qian if he were still alive and if he were to face his attack head-on.

Right now, Great General Xie was still comprehending dao in front of the ancient coffin. However, a wisp of his divine sense had traveled over, threatening Ling Han with death.

The reason that this was only a threat was because Ling Han was still facing heavenly tribulation. If one interfered in someone else’s heavenly tribulation by attacking them, they would be targeted by heavenly tribulation themself. If one interfered in someone else’s heavenly tribulation by protecting them... Well, Ling Han had already experienced that. They would suffer from heavenly tribulation that was at least 10 times more powerful.

Even Xie Qian didn’t dare to casually involve himself in someone else’s heavenly tribulation. Although he was confident in staying alive, he would definitely need to sacrifice some life force. Was it worth sacrificing his life force to kill a measly Sun Moon Tier cultivator?

No way!

Heavenly tribulations would only last for half a day, and he could afford to wait for this long. Could a measly Sun Moon Tier cultivator possibly escape from his grasp?

This wisp of divine sense didn’t speak. It didn’t interrogate Ling Han about why he had killed Xie Donglai, nor did it announce in a haughty manner that those who killed members of the Xie Clan would face certain death.

It did none of these things. Xie Qian’s wisp of divine sense simply hung around quietly. With his status and power, there was no need for him to boast before such a lowly being. They were on completely different levels, like an emperor to his peasants.

Ling Han also regarded this divine sense coldly. Xie Qian’s divine sense had transformed into a projection of none other than Great General Xie himself. He was suited in armor, appearing especially mighty and overbearing. Killing intent oozed from his body.

However, Ling Han was unafraid as he stared at this Eternal River Tier elite.

Kuang!

Heavenly tribulation continued to descend, yet Ling Han didn’t bat an eyelid. He stared at Xie Qian just like that, as if he wanted to challenge this elite.

‘Perhaps my strength is far inferior to yours, but my will is as strong as heaven! You can’t suppress me!’

Astonishment gradually spread across the face of Xie Qian’s projection.

Who could overcome heavenly tribulation so easily?

Thus, even though Great General Xie had seen many elites, and even though he was accustomed to witnessing death and experiencing dangers, he was still filled with a sense of astonishment. He had never witnessed someone facing heavenly tribulation with such ease before.

Ling Han had actually astounded an Eternal River Tier elite! If news of this got out, he would definitely shoot to fame.
