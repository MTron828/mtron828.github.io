Chapter 2502: The current circumstances

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Boom, the heavenly tribulation descended, turning into a massive, heavy sword that blazed with lightning, striking down on Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and condensed the power of Regulation to meet this strike.?Boom, his fists burst with light that dazzled the world as he faced the heavenly tribulation head-on.

The might of the heavenly tribulation had indeed reached the Fourth Heaven, but Ling Han‚Äôs battle prowess was even stronger. His battle prowess was directly above the middle stage of the Fourth Heaven, soaring close to the Fifth Heaven.

The Celestial Seed was rapidly sprouting, and maturing for the third time. Three golden celestial patterns could be clearly seen on the Celestial Seed, two of them extremely deep, while the third was extremely light‚Äîso light that it was practically invisible, but it was presently becoming deeper.

When the heavenly tribulation arrived, this was the time of fastest improvement. The power of heaven and earth naturally was the most fundamental power, and was the most beneficial in terms of maturing Regulations.

With Ling Han bursting with endless battle cries, his fists danced like a wind as he showed not the slightest bit of fear in face of the heavenly tribulation. With a few strikes, he shattered the tribulation.

This was a one-sided suppression of strength.

The heavenly tribulation was already strong enough, and Ling Han was clearly undergoing a Third-Heaven heavenly tribulation, but what had descended was at the Fourth Heaven. However, Ling Han was even more freakish. His battle prowess was over the middle stage of the Fourth Heaven, advancing towards the Fifth Heaven.

He stimulated the Celestial Seed in his body to grow with all his power. This was a rare chance.

In truth, his cultivation level had really increased too quickly. It was like he had suddenly surged up from the First Heaven to Third Heaven in the blink of an eye. There would definitely be a factor of instability in his cultivation level. Hence, he planned to stabilize and strengthen his foundations and cultivation level after breaking through this time.

Half a day‚Äôs time soon passed. Ling Han stood firmly, a hint of a smile curling the corners of his lips. His present cultivation level had stopped at the early stage of the Third Heaven, and it looked like he had walked half the way. This was already extremely impressive.

‚ÄòWhere is this?‚Äô

Ling Han sensed the density of the Spiritual Qi. The difference between the Western Celestial Realm and Eastern Celestial Realm was quite wide.

Western Celestial Realm, he immediately answered his own question. Then, with a movement, he flew towards the boundless seas.

He was going to travel to the east, and return to the Eastern Celestial Realm to find his parents.

He believed that if the Empress and the others were still in the Eastern Celestial Realm, they would definitely be waiting there for him. And if they had already left the Celestial Realm, they would definitely have left a message for him there.

With how great the speed of a Celestial King was, especially for Ling Han, this kind of Celestial King that was proficient in the Regulations of Space, he had arrived at the coast in about half a month‚Äôs time.

In the past, these seas were incredibly dangerous to him, but the present he considered this a smooth journey. As long as he did not encounter any great beast of the Seventh Heaven Celestial King Tier and above, he could face everything calmly.

He began to cross the seas. There was no need for him to worry if he would barge into the lair of some powerful marine beasts. He simply advanced on a straight course.

Some marine beasts did not even realize he had passed them by, and those that did were completely incapable of matching him. They could only tremble in fear, and feel thankful that Ling Han had not attacked them.

However, it was not every marine creature that would act the same, after all. When Ling Han passed by an island, a golden Roc shot into the skies, and set off in pursuit of him.

This great Roc was proficient in the Regulations of Space. With a flap of its wings, it had thrown a boundless distance behind it. A shrill cry rang from its beak, the sound wave reverberating, and possessing frightening destructive power.

Ling Han had initially no plans to cause trouble, but after he dodged a few times, this great Roc was still not willing to let him go. Involuntarily, Ling Han was also angered, and stood still.

‚ÄúDie!‚Äù When the golden-winged great Roc blasted its divine sense towards Ling Han, its figure also descended sharply, its claws aiming straight for Ling Han. It was as if they were forged from Divine Metal, and could easily tear apart the body of a low-tier Celestial King.

It was a Fourth Heaven existence!

Ling Han humphed, and drew the Divine Demon Sword, which he lowered sharply in a slash.

Pu!

Blood spurted and sprayed from the golden-winged great Roc. Its claws had been forcefully chopped off. It paled in shock, and only now did it know that Ling Han‚Äôs tolerance of it had not been because he was outmatched, but because he had not taken it to heart at all.

It hurriedly flapped its wings, wanting to flee, but how could Ling Han allow it to leave now that he was forced to fight back?

He followed up with another sword strike.?Pu, another fountain of blood gushed out, and the golden-winged great Roc instantly fell from the skies. However, it had not fallen too far when Ling Han had stretched out a hand and got hold of it, stowing it inside his Spatial God Tool.

‚Ä¶With his present strength, it was just the matter of a single thought for him to create a Spatial God Tool.

Flying beasts were extremely delicious in the first place, what more when this was a Celestial King at that. How could he allow all its flesh to go to waste?

The heaven and earth grieved, a boundless shower of blood raining down, also scaring the great beasts in this area of the sea into hurriedly rushing to the depths of the great seas as they feared that Ling Han would start a massacre. ALL new ùíÑhapters ùíên nùíêv(ùíÜ)lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled faintly, and continued his journey.

After all, Celestial Kings were not so common. Though there were a considerable number of Celestial Kings in the boundless seas, the latter themselves were overwhelmingly huge. Just how high were the chances of Ling Han just happening to pass by the lair of a great Celestial King Tier beast?

Another month later, he had crossed the boundless seas, and set foot on the soil of the Eastern Celestial Realm.

He discerned the directions slightly, and then continued advancing.

Eight days later, he arrived at where his parents were.

He felt a little anxious. After all, too much time had really elapsed this time round. He feared he would witness a scene that would break his heart.

He arrived, and called out loudly, ‚ÄúFather, Mother!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, what are you shouting for!‚Äù There were guards here, and they immediately rebuked him sharply.

‚ÄúAre you an idiot? Coming here and calling father and mother?‚Äù One of the guards laughed.

‚ÄúYi, why does this guy look a little familiar?‚Äù

‚ÄúLord Ling Han!‚Äù

He had been recognized, and someone immediately went off to report his arrival. Now, it had become lively. His parents, uncle, Eldest and Third Brother, and Liu Yu Tong and the other women all surged forth to greet him.

Seeing that Ling Han was fine, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Though they all firmly believed that Ling Han would definitely be fine, they would still feel anxious and could not rest easy unless they saw him with their own eyes.

Ling Han briefly related his experiences. Though over a million years had passed, he had not done many things, so speaking of his experiences was just the matter of a few words. However, the experiences of the others were much more varied.

Next, they naturally talked about the Empress and the others.

Zhou Heng had deliberately waited for Ling Han another few thousand years. In fact, he had even used his methods to search for him. However, this was the Celestial Realm, after all. He could not unleash his full abilities, fearing that he would cause this realm to burst in a moment of carelessness.

Thus, he had not found Ling Han, and could only take the others with him and make an advanced departure.

The Empress, Hu Niu, Bewitching Maiden Rou, the Rain Emperor, and the others had all left. As long as they had the aptitude of a monarch tier, it was fine. In a transcendent dimension, even a monarch tier would have a sliver of hope of becoming a Heavenly Venerate.

Of course, the chance of this happening was pitifully low. It might be that not even one would succeed out of 100 million, but there was still hope, after all.

What surprised Ling Han was the fact that Heavenborn was actually included!

This guy had caused a massacre, and at least over 10,000 Celestial Kings had died by his hand, and they actually allowed him to go into the transcendent dimension?

‚ÄúIt was said that Heavenborn‚Äôs aptitude is too great, and there are very high hopes that he could become a Heavenly Venerate in the future,‚Äù Feng Po Yun explained. This naturally was not something that he had heard from Zhou Heng, but rather a message relayed by the Empress and the others.

Ling Han frowned. It looked like the war situation in the transcendent dimension was extremely tense. Otherwise, they would not have brought even such a bringer of slaughter like Heavenborn with them.

Only Heavenly Venerable Tier‚Ä¶ could resist Hysteria. The difference was that a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate was absolutely the main force, while a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could only help here and there, but no matter how minor their role, they could still be of some use, at the very least.

‚ÄúThis is the Dimensional Transfer Seal that Lord Zhou has left for you.‚Äù Feng Po Yun handed over a jade seal. It looked to be completely average, and did not seem to be anything special. ‚ÄúLord Zhou has said that as long as you activate it with Celestial King Tier power, you can send around 10 people into the transcendent dimension.‚Äù
