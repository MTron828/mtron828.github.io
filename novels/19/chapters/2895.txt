2896 Drawing Fire

In terms of conventional battle prowess, Qi Xuan believed that he could crush Ling Han.

However, that could not hold up against the fact that Ling Han possessed astonishing combination seals. Those were too terrifying, and were enough to increase Ling Han’s strength by more than 200 times. As a late-stage Fifth Tier, he could only concede defeat.

Was it not clear that Fei Wu had already been blasted into bits by Ling Han’s punch?

If Qi Xuan stubbornly continued to resist, he would only be blasted into pieces by Ling Han.

!!

However, if he didn’t exhaust Ling Han’s set of combination seals, wouldn’t that mean that he would never be a match for Ling Han?

Only by inviting at least three to four Fifth Tiers to engage in consecutive battles against Ling Han would Ling Han’s strength be beaten back to its original state after two hours—Qi Xuan didn’t believe that Ling Han could still possess a second set of combination seals.

The problem was that if they forcefully faced off against the current Ling Han, then even a Fifth Tier would be blasted into smithereens. Who would be willing to sacrifice themselves for others?

There was no such fool in the world.

Qi Xuan ran as fast as he could, but countless thoughts were already rushing through his mind. In the end, he decided to borrow the hand of another to kill Ling Han.

Whether it was that first-grade seal or the even more shocking combination seals, he wanted them all!

***

Ling Han didn’t pursue Qi Xuan for too long. The two of them could be considered to be of the same cultivation level now. Even if there was a disparity in strength, if one of them wanted to leave, the other person simply wouldn’t be able to catch up.

It was a bit of a pity, but Ling Han did not take it to heart. He had an invincible heart, and he would become stronger with every passing day. Now, he was no longer afraid of Qi Xuan, and he certainly would not be in the future.

Ling Han first refined Fei Wu’s life essence.

Although Fei Wu’s name was “trash,” the life essence in his body was exuberant to the extreme and shockingly dense. Although he was only one person, it was enough to make Ling Han feel bloated. If he were to kill Qi Xuan as well, he would definitely feel extremely uncomfortable.

As expected of Fifth Tier, his body had been tempered by four types of fundamental powers. It was simply a super Great Herb.

It took some time for Ling Han to completely refine all of this life essence. He stood up, and continued to search for new veins of ore with the Empress and Hu Niu.

Every once in a while, they would enter the Celestial Guest Residence and meet with the other women. As a family, they naturally had to be together.

In addition, Ling Han also worked hard to increase the number of people with the bloodline of the Ling Clan, but even a freakish person like him couldn’t rush such things. Tens of thousands to hundreds of millions of years had passed, yet none of the women’s stomachs had swelled with pregnancy, making Hu Niu cry out at the unfairness of it all.

Niu couldn’t be bullied like this.

This dimension encompassed other dimensions, and it was inevitable that every dimension would be slightly smaller than the previous one. There were differences even among high-level dimensions.

Therefore, after hundreds of millions of years of digging, the veins of ore on this level were quickly dug clean.

Everyone turned their attention to the fifth dimension.

Indeed, this dimension existed, but the path downward was even more difficult. Under the intense pressure of the overlapping dimensions, the friction and collision of the fundamental particles had already reached an incomparably terrifying level, and even Second Tiers could not force their way in.

Furthermore, there were even fewer veins of ore in the fifth dimension. However, the probability of producing Heavenly Venerable Seals and Great Herbs was higher, and the profits here weren’t any lower than in the previous four dimensions.

Right at this moment, Ling Han heard a piece of news that was extremely disadvantageous to him.

It was said that Ling Han had a first-grade seal and even a complete set of ninth-grade seals. When combined, it could erupt with more than 200 times the power.

After Ling Han heard this news, his first thought was naturally that it was Qi Xuan’s doing. Right now, only Qi Xuan knew of his big secret.

Ling Han only had to think for a moment to know what Qi Xuan was up to. This guy wanted to use others to exhaust Ling Han’s chance to use the first-grade seal and combination seals. Then, he would take the opportunity to kill Ling Han and seize the Heavenly Venerable Seals.

This plan was quite clever. However, after thinking about it carefully, it was actually not reliable.

Firstly, Ling Han was also at the Fifth Tier in terms of strength. Even if Qi Xuan could gain an advantage in battle prowess, how could he stop Ling Han from escaping? Secondly, there were still Sixth Tiers in this world. If Sixth Tiers interfered, would there still be a share for Qi Xuan?

Of course, Ling Han would not be having a headache on Qi Xuan’s behalf. He knew that he was about to face the pursuit of many elites.

Sure enough, several years later, the trio encountered a group of elites, and the latter directly attacked without saying a word. In the end, Ling Han killed them easily.

…Mere Fourth Tiers actually dared to attack him?

Obviously, Qi Xuan had only said that Ling Han possessed precious Heavenly Venerable Seals, and had not told the truth that, in fact, Ling Han’s battle prowess had even reached the Fifth Tier.

If he really said that, then even Fifth Tier elites would naturally be wary of Ling Han, and it would be impossible for them to move easily. Wouldn’t that just be paving the way for others?

This was only the beginning. Following that, even more Heavenly Venerates came looking for Ling Han.

“Ling Han!” A Fifth Tier elite appeared. He wore a black robe, and his entire body exuded a faint chill. “Hand over the Heavenly Venerable Seals yourself, and you can avoid death.”

Ling Han looked around, and asked, “You’re alone?”

The black-robed Fifth Tier couldn’t help but be angered to laughter. “To suppress a puny Third Tier like you, how many Fifth Tiers does it take?”

Ling Han nodded very seriously, and said, “You’re right.”

“Looks like you don’t intend to be honest and obedient.” The black-robed Fifth Tier cultivator moved to suppress Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han raised his fists to counterattack. He had only boosted himself with a seventh-grade seal, but it was enough to suppress his opponent.

“What?!” The black-robed Fifth Tier turned pale with fright. This was something he had not expected at all. Not only could a Third Tier rival him, he could even in fact suppress him?

He hurriedly channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seals as well, and his battle prowess instantly shot up, moving to clash head-on with Ling Han.

He was in the middle stage of the Fifth Tier, and his conventional battle prowess was slightly stronger than Ling Han’s. Furthermore, he was channeling a sixth-grade seal, and the effect of his power enhancement far exceeded that of a seventh-grade seal. Naturally, he instantly reversed the disadvantage and suppressed Ling Han instead.

“Do you think I don’t have a high-level Heavenly Venerable Seal?” he said coldly, appearing very disdainful.

“Is that so?” Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. The first-grade seal was already activated. “Comparing Heavenly Venerable Seals with me, are you stupid?”

When the first-grade seal appeared, it boosted Ling Han’s strength by 80 times, so he naturally had the upper hand again.

The black-robed Fifth Tier couldn’t help but be speechless. That’s right; didn’t he run over to look for Ling Han because the latter had mastered a first-grade seal and those even more terrifying combination seals? Now, he was actually competing with him in Heavenly Venerable Seals. Wasn’t he just foolish?

A look of astonishment appeared on his face. The current Ling Han was already so terrifying. What if he used those combination seals then?

Would he die?

With this thought in mind, he naturally had the intention to retreat.

“You want to leave? It’s too late now!” Ling Han shook his head. Previously, it was naturally easy for the other party to escape, but now that he was already entangled, it would be strange if he could still escape.
