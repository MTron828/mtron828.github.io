Chapter 2603: Ling Han’s might

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Yin River Celestial King was arrogant, but he wasn’t stupid at all.

Seeing how A’Yuan’s attack was so powerful, he took the initiative to decrease his offensive force. He was now mainly responsible for defense, not only for himself, but also for A’Yuan, so that A’Yuan could proceed without reservations.

This combination of attack and defense allowed A’Yuan’s battle prowess to be fully unleashed, further suppressing Ling Han.

Sword light flashed, and blood spattered.

This time Ling Han got injured. A’Yuan’s sword was too fast and too sharp; as long as he remained unsuppressed and with his full battle prowess unleashed, he really was a nightmare for any opponent.

Ling Han continuously sustained injuries, and there was blood everywhere.

In order to attack unrestrained, they kept on moving while still engaged in fighting. They came to a small platform, which was relatively more spacious. There was a formation drawn on the ground; how was it drawn?

Instead of using a brush, this part of the ground was concave. Therefore, when blood was spilled on the ground and naturally flowed into the grooves of the formation, the entire formation suddenly appeared to come alive.

Weng, when the formation was completely filled with blood, it suddenly emitted a glorious light, and a creature appeared out of nowhere—a black bear-like monster covered with tentacles.

This kind of monster… had appeared again!

Ling Han experienced a strange feeling as the aura emanating from this monster felt so familiar to him.

Shua, as soon as the monster appeared, it waved its tentacles and attacked Ling Han, A’Yuan, and the Yin River Celestial King.

Ling Han humphed, avoiding the attacks of A’Yuan and the Yin River Celestial King, and then threw a punch at the tentacles of the black monster bear.

Peng!

With just a single punch, the tentacles of the black monster immediately burst. They could not even withstand a single blow. However, the tentacles turned into countless pieces that scattered outwards in all directions.

Ling Han activated the Source Power to shield himself from these pieces. Who knew what these things might be? He absolutely did not want them to touch him.

On the other side, the Yin River Celestial King also unraveled the attack of the black bear monster. Meanwhile, A’Yuan didn’t waste one bit of energy. With a slash of his sword, he attacked fiercely.

The black bear monster made another move, and it was another attack directed at Ling Han and the others.

For A’Yuan, the attack didn’t matter anyway, since the Yin River Celestial King would subdue it, but for Ling Han, it was akin to having one more opponent. He was already in a disadvantageous position, so an additional opponent naturally increased the pressure on him

Moreover, the formation continued to operate, and another black bear monster appeared.

Ling Han shouted furiously. He already fully understood the level of his strength, so there was no need to continue being beaten down on.

The Divine Demon Sword was drawn!

Weng, a cold light flashed, and Sword Qi surged out.?Pu! Pu! Pu!?Even this incomparably strong wall could not withstand the Sword Qi of the Divine Demon Sword, and there immediately emerged countless marks several inches in depth.

Ling Han started to counterattack.?Pu!?The Sword Qi swept out, and the black bear monster that had just appeared was immediately cut in half. This kind of thing had no concept of defense at all. Its destructive power was terrifying, but it had zero defenses. As long as one’s battle prowess was overwhelmed, killing it was relatively simple.

As soon as the sword was drawn, it could no longer be hindered. The Divine Demon Sword slashed again.?Pu!?The first black bear monster was also cut in half.

Ling Han’s sword clashed against A’Yuan’s sword, and Ling Han saw a small particle immediately appear on his opponent’s sword. The Divine Demon Sword was so sharp; how could anything that was not Divine Metal be able to withstand it? But A’Yuan’s sword was also remarkable; it was not snapped in a single slash.

A’Yuan’s ability to adapt was astonishingly fast. When his sword was parried in one slash, he immediately retracted the sword and stabbed again.

Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!?He stabbed with his sword several hundred times in a row, but this offensive was completed in only an instant.

This required the support of extremely powerful Body Art.

A’Yuan’s Body Art might be incomparable to Ling Han’s, but compared to other Celestial Kings, he was absolutely much stronger.

Ling Han returned like for like, blocking every one of A’Yuan’s strikes with great speed.

“Die!” the Yin River Celestial King shouted as he, too, attacked, wanting to use this chance to kill Ling Han.

He concentrated the Regulations of Water, which took the form of a black dragon that pierced towards Ling Han.

Ling Han stared coldly at the Yin River Celestial King, his gaze full of disdain. “Are you even worthy of being my opponent?”

He could regard A’Yuan as an opponent, but the Yin River Celestial King? Hehe, he really wasn’t worthy of it; no matter how strong his battle prowess was, he was not worthy of Ling Han’s notice.

He exclaimed softly, and directed his attack towards the Yin River Celestial King.

The Divine Demon Sword glowed. This was an object that surpassed any Celestial Weapon. Although it hadn’t reached the level of Heavenly Venerate Tool yet, its power was unparalleled. Just the Sword Qi alone was extremely terrifying, and it could pose a great threat even to Celestial-King-level defense.

How would the Yin River Celestial King dare to face it head-on? He had already suffered once before. Thus, he instantly took multiple steps backwards.

A’Yuan kept on attacking, but Ling Han was actively channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. For a short period of time, his defense was comparable to that of Divine Metal. Therefore, it didn’t matter how many times A’Yuan cut him.

Ling Han set his eyes on the Yin River Celestial King. He was going to kill this person.

The Yin River Celestial King blocked the attacks. However, a Ling Han who didn’t have the Divine Demon Sword in his hand was no weaker than him. Now with Ling Han wielding a Celestial Tool, how was the Yin River any match?

He had blocked several attacks, but was already severely injured. He gritted his teeth, and immediately turned around with the intention to run away.

As for A’Yuan? He couldn’t care less.

“Do you think you can run?” Ling Han unleashed the Regulations of Space, pressing down with his left hand.?Bang!?The Yin River Celestial King seemed to have crashed into an invisible wall. Although he smashed through it, his speed was greatly reduced.

Ling Han caught up and continued to deliver sword strikes. With the boost of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, the Divine Demon Sword became even more terrifying.

The Yin River Celestial King shouted loudly; he was unwilling to die here.

He was a Monarch Tier, and he had a great chance to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the Celestial King Graveyard. There was even a chance for him to become a Heavenly Venerate in the future, although this chance was extremely slim.

How could such a prodigy die here?

He wanted to escape. He would not come out again until he had attained the Ninth Heaven of the Celestial King Tier.

How would Ling Han let him go? All kinds of Regulations were continuously used by his hands: the flow of time slowed down, the space was frozen, and gravity was like a mountain. It reached the extent that the Yin River Celestial King had no chance to escape at all.

Despite A’Yuan’s attacks being equally fierce, the activated defense of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll caused A’Yuan to be unable to do anything against Ling Han at all. Unless the sword in his hand was replaced by a Celestial Weapon, he couldn’t pose a threat to Ling Han’s physique.

The Yin River Celestial King gritted his teeth and turned back around. Now he could only go all out in the fight, otherwise he would really die here for sure.

‘Die!’

He rushed towards Ling Han, believing that Ling Han’s defense couldn’t be so perfect that it could last indefinitely. As long as he survived this wave of Ling Han’s attacks, he would be able to join forces with A’Yuan to suppress Ling Han again.

This wasn’t a bad idea, but he had overestimated the strength of his force combined with A’Yuan’s, and underestimated the power of Ling Han and the Divine Demon Sword.

Ling Han strongly suppressed the attacks. Every time the Divine Demon Sword slashed out, it would cause blood to spatter like a fountain.

What was the Divine Demon Sword?

It was a Celestial Tool, and was even proceeding in the direction of becoming a Heavenly Venerate Tool. Its destructive power was too terrifying. Being slashed by it was definitely not as simple as sustaining physical injuries. The terrifying murderous aura would actually invade all parts of the body.

The Yin River Celestial King coughed up blood. The Divine Demon Sword had already damaged his internal organs to bits and pieces, and he could not help but vomit blood.

He was in great pain. He had a feeling that if he continued to fight like this, he wouldn’t need to be struck down by Divine Demon Sword at all, as all the accumulated injuries he sustained could cause him to die at any time.

Why hadn’t Ling Han’s defenses dissipated yet?

“The person I want to kill… won’t be able to escape!” Ling Han said menacingly.
