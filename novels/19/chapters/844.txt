Chapter 845: Take a single strike from my sword

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Having entered the Black Tower, one could only comply and submit no matter how powerful one was!

Ling Han turned around, and looked at Yang Guan.

His battle with the Asura Demon Emperor might have seemed long, but in reality, it was simply a matter of two or three strikes. At this time, Yang Guan was still under immense shock, and had only started to return to his senses just a moment ago.

Peng , from a distance, Xiao Miaoyan flew out of the broken mountain. The clothes on her body were torn in many places, revealing her snow white skin, making her appear extremely alluring. Blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth, and her face was pale, her hair somewhat messy, and her eyes full of fear.

She was truly scared.

How could she match the current Ling Han?

She was really about to cry. Battle prowess of Eighteen Stars for a Shattering Void cultivator in the Immortal Realm could practically wipe out someone of the same age, at least within the five great sects’ territory, but she was actually slapped in the face repeatedly upon descending on to the Lower Realm.

Ma Duo Bao, a mysterious elite in the huge ship, and now a Ling Han was added.

Could it be that this was the Immortal Realm instead?

“Retreat!” She immediately made up her mind. Damn it, she would never come here ever again. It would be better to wait for the Immortal Realm to send their people here first before proceeding further. Such a monster should be dealt with by people of the Immortal Realm.

Without another word, Yang Guan just turned around and ran.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Brother Guan, in any case, you are the pride of the Immortal Realm. How is it that you came here full of confidence and in high spirits, yet now leave with your tail between your legs without even using a single move? That’s inexcusable. Come, let us spar!”

Spar your sister!

Yang Guan’s cheek began to twitch. It might have appeared that Xiao Miaoyan had only exchanged a single blow, but that resulted in her taking a hit and being flung far away. She might still appear to be perfectly fine, but was actually suffering from a very serious internal injury. If not treated in time, there would be endless dire consequences.

But now, there was no time to heal her. He had to flee for his life first!

He had to keep himself alive; upon his return to the Immortal Realm, there would be spiritual medicine that could treat his injury.

“Brother Guan is so uncooperative. Then, you leave me with no choice!” Ling Han activated the Demon Fairy Step and Thunderclap Ninth Heaven; his speed as quick as a demon, he instantly stopped in front of Guan Yang to block his path.

Guan Yang clenched his teeth, and hong , light flickered over his body.

He ignited his life force with the intention of breaking out of Ling Han’s hold.

“Didn’t you look down upon creatures of the Lower Realm?” Ling gave a cold smile. With a palm strike, an overflowing print of golden light came in full force, and covered the entire sky. “Now, what are you escaping for? Come fight an ant like me from the Lower Realm!”

Yang Guan tried escaping. Peng , though his speed was fast, the entire space around him had been sealed off with an imprint of golden light, and he had actually bounced back after hitting against it.

He was stunned. By burning his life force, a Shattering Void Tier cultivator with battle prowess of Twenty Stars wouldn’t be able to stop his escape, but he was actually blocked now! What did this mean? Ling Han’s battle prowess had actually surpassed twenty Stars!

Strength could not exceed the limit of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, but that didn’t mean that the same would be true for battle prowess!

“I will launch a single strike with my sword. If you can stop it, I will spare your life!” Ling Han shouted. “This is for real!” These two sentences, he announced to the world through the totem.

“Long live His Majesty!”

“Slaughter the Immortals! Slaughter the Immortals! Slaughter the Immortals!”

The people of the Imperial Capital who knew the truth immediately cheered. Those in the other cities might not be clear of the reasons behind this, but they were all fired up because they felt that their emperor was too domineering. Of course, Helian Xun Xue had explained the whole event in advance through the totem. This was the best time for Ling Han to establish an invincible image.

Soon, the entire Great Ling Empire knew that their emperor was fighting with the Immortals, that was, the culprit that wanted to make use of them to concoct an alchemical pill!

Yang Guan and Xiao Miaoyan actually weren’t Immortals, but why bother with these details? Helian Xun Xue even wanted to say that these two people were the strongest of the Immortals so that Ling Han would seem even more domineering.

While the people of the nation were all fired up, Ling Han realized that the power of the nation that he had absorbed was somewhat stronger, so much so that he felt that he was being filled up to a bursting point.

With the four regions combined, they were comparable to the middle state.

True enough, the physique of Level Ten precious metal could only absorb so much power of the nation; any more, and it would cause one to burst! Even someone like Ma Duo Bao had the self-awareness to know that just a portion from the middle state was enough to drive him up the wall.

Ling Han brandished his sword, and used the Mysterious Three Thousand technique.

“How can it be! How could you possibly know—”

Pu!

Yang Guan was shocked upon seeing the Mysterious Three Thousand. This was a technique of the Heaven’s Sword Sect that wouldn’t be passed down easily. How could it appear in the hands of an ant from the Lower Realm? But before he could finish speaking, his body was sliced to pieces by the Sword Ray.

There was just too much of a gap between his battle prowess and physique in comparison to Ling Han’s current state, so naturally there wasn’t any need to use 10,000 Techniques Return to One..

With just a single strike, one known as the pride of the Immortal Realm was killed just like this, dying in the land of the Lower Realm.

The blood of Shattering Void Tier cultivators was spilled, and with a rumble, the heavens and earth shook. In a sense, this was a precious asset, which would certainly result in the growth of one or even a few high quality Spiritual Herbs after a number of years.

“Yang Guan!” As Xiao Miaoyan ran, she turned around just in time to watch the scene of Yang Guan being killed by Ling Han’s sword, and could not help but speak harshly as her eyes narrowed to slits. “You dare to kill the people from the Immortal Realm, you are doomed to die! When the ultimate elite of my sect comes, it will be the day of your punishment!”

Ling Han’s expression remained cold as he picked up his sword and swiftly gave chase. “Every 10,000 years, the five great sects use all living creatures from a single realm to concoct an alchemical pill. With the passing of a few millennia, how much blood debt has been owed? When I enter the Immortal Realm, I will have the five great sects uprooted, and have them settle the old debts incurred from the past few generations!”

“Like a fish in a pond, you have no idea how big the Immortal Realm is, and how strong the Immortals are!” Xiao Miaoyan burned her lifeforce and ran madly. As long as she escaped out of the Great Ling Empire, Ling Han wouldn’t be so strong, losing the support of the power of the nation.

At that time, she would fight back and attack if he still dared to give chase.

“With their fixing their gaze upon the Lower Realm, I can imagine that the five great sects are definitely the weakest sects in the Immortal Realm, and at most have only cultivators of the Sun Moon Tier!” Ling Han said calmly.

What did you mean only Sun Moon Tier? Did you know how difficult it was to cross over to the Immortal Realm? Don’t just look at the Immortals only being divided into five big tiers; there was a whole world of difference between them, just like between the Body Refining Tier and Shattering Void Tier!

Every tier was divided into four small tiers. The gap was extremely huge. Practically no one could ever match an opponent on a higher small tier than themselves. Only when the small tiers were further divided into early, middle, late, and peak stages would there appear a genius who could cross over a stage in a small tier.

Taking all that into account, how strong could the Sun Moon Tier be?

That was least a dozen levels more than Shattering Void Tier!

“What big talk!” Xiao Miaoyan naturally would not share any information regarding the Immortal Realm with Ling Han, although she didn’t know that such information had been told to Ling Han by Yi Shuang Shuang. Saying anything would be useless now. If only the ultimate elite of the Immortal Realm came, and, for example, bound Ling Han and brought him into the Immortal Realm, then his so-called invincibility would become a super big joke!

In the Immortal Realm, wouldn’t killing a Shattering Void Tier cultivator with battle prowess of Twenty Stars be not much different from an Immortal raising his foot to step on an ant?

“Hehe, if you disagree, then receive a single strike from my sword!” Ling Han rushed to give chase. The other party had burned her lifeforce, but he was reluctant to do the same even if using Thunderclap Ninth Heaven in addition to Demon Fairy Steps wasn’t enough to surpass the other party’s speed.

However, this was the Great Ling Empire!
