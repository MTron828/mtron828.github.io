Chapter 1472 Ancestor Wenxin

“I’ll crawl! I’ll crawl!” Yi Gaoning’s willpower was completely broken. Mating with sows 100 times, and then being sodomized by boars 100 times... Could any human endure this?He was afraid that Ling Han wouldn’t agree, so he immediately charged to the dog flap before lowering his head and starting to crawl through. It was as if he would fight with his life if Ling Han didn’t allow him to crawl through. The surrounding disciples all widened their eyes in shock upon seeing this. Since when had crawling through a dog flap become so desirable?

Ling Han couldn’t help but glance at the large black dog, and say, “You’re truly impressive. You actually managed to break the willpower of an Eternal River Tier elite with words!”

“Of course! I’m Grandpa Dog!” the large black dog said smugly. He was standing on his hind legs like a human, and he reached his front paw down in an attempt to scratch his bottom. However, his claws raked into his iron underwear instead, giving rise to an ear-piercing scraping sound.

“Stop!” There was a furious roar as several senior disciples dashed over. They had all become incredibly furious upon seeing Yi Gaoning crawl through the dog flap.

Him crawling through the dog flap had represented the loss of the senior disciples’ face!

However, Yi Gaoning had been petrified by the large black dog’s threat.

Mating with sows 100 times, and then being sodomized by boars 100 times... 100 times! These were the two words ringing inside his mind. In fact, he hadn’t noticed the arrival of the senior disciples at all. He was mumbling to himself, his face pale as he resolutely crawled through the dog flap.

In his eyes, this wasn’t a dog flap. Instead, this was a passageway to freedom, a passageway that allowed him to crawl out of hell!

“Heh!” The large black dog was feeling extremely accomplished at this moment.

Indeed, being able to petrify an Eternal River Tier elite to such an extent was something to be proud of. However, this large black dog was far too uncouth, with his tactics more so incredibly debauched. It was very likely that no one felt any admiration for him. Instead, they were probably feeling disdain.

“Yi Gaoning!” the senior disciples roared. Their voices were like booming thunder, and it was as if they wanted to shake Yi Gaoning to his senses.

This was indeed effective, with Yi Gaoning being dazed by their roars. He then suddenly came to his senses, with his crawling action also faltering before stopping. There was a confused expression on his face. However, this expression quickly transformed into one of beet-red humiliation before again transforming into one of utter grief and desire for death.

His name and reputation had been destroyed!

More importantly, he was coincidentally halfway through the dog flap. The top half of his body was inside, while the bottom half of his body was still outside. Moreover, his bottom was raised into the air. This was a comical sight.

Being as depraved as he was, the large black dog retrieved a staff from his Spatial Spirit Tool before stabbing it at Yi Gaoning.

“Aaah...!” Yi Gaoning howled in agony. This was perhaps his most agonized wail since birth. Like a frightened rabbit, he immediately shot through the dog flap, emerging from the other end. Meanwhile, everyone could clearly see the cloud of blood spraying from his bottom.

This... As a mighty Eternal River Tier elite, he had actually had his an*s penetrated before everyone!

“Hahaha... Hahahaha!” The large black dog was rolling on the ground and laughing. His legs were kicking in the air, and his iron underwear continued to collide with the ground, giving rise to a loud clanging sound.

Everyone shook their heads upon seeing this. At this moment, Yi Gaoning’s face and reputation had truly been ruined. He was destined to become the butt of jokes now. Whenever people talked about him, they would definitely have to mention how he had suffered a penetrated an*s when crawling through a dog flap on this day. Moreover, he had been kneeling on the ground with his bottom raised in preparation.

Yi Gaoning sprinted away in humiliation, not having the face to glance back. As he sprinted away, all he left behind were two trails of glistening tears.

“Damn it!” The senior disciples were burning with rage as they walked over. Their rage was almost corporeal, and the flames of fury that burst from their eyes measured at least one foot long.

Eternal River Tier, Eternal River Tier, Eternal River Tier... The six senior disciples were all at the Eternal River Tier!

These were the reinforcements that some of the senior disciples had called after crawling through the dog flap.

Fortunately, these six people were only at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. However, there were six of them! Was this not enough to suppress a few Heavenly Body Tier cultivators?

Initially, they had been doubtful that someone as powerful as Yi Gaoning would fail to suppress a few junior disciples at the Heavenly Body Tier. However, upon arriving, they had personally witnessed Yi Gaoning being forced to crawl through the dog flap.

In any case, there were only three troublemakers. Moreover, one of them was only at the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Thus, this person could naturally be ignored. In their eyes, such a cultivator couldn’t even be considered as an elite. After all, they could defeat such a cultivator with a single glare.

That being the case, the only troublemakers remaining would be that man and woman.

‘Could it be that they possess some powerful Saint Tool? Otherwise, how could they have withstood the power of an Eternal River Tier elite?’

However, there were six of them right now, so what did it matter even if these two troublemakers possessed a powerful Saint Tool? After all, they had an overwhelming advantage in numbers.

A senior disciple stepped forward, and said, “Humph! The academy has its own regulations, yet you’re not abiding by those regulations! You’re asking for a beating!” He looked around 30 or so, with silver hair and a single horn on his forehead. There was a haughty expression on his face.

His original form was that of a Demonic Beast. However, because his bloodline was extremely noble, he was naturally haughty and conceited. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Kneel!” Empress Luan Xing said in an even haughtier and more domineering manner.

However, the empress was far too beautiful, so even her domineering demeanor was charming and attractive. One wouldn’t be able to feel any hostility toward her. Instead, they would feel that she had a strong personality, with her smile and laugh incredibly beautiful. In fact, even her expression of anger was breathtakingly beautiful.

The silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple couldn’t help but fall victim to the empress’ captivating charm. There was a look of intoxication on his face. However, he immediately shook his head to clear his mind, saying, “You actually want me to kneel?”

‘Preposterous! Are the new disciples genuinely trying to defy the heavens?’

However, Empress Luan Xing couldn’t even be bothered replying. She directly lashed out.

Weng!

Four heavenly bodies materialized behind her, each of them radiating with a menacing might. This was the might of a supreme king tier.

The silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple sneered coldly. ‘You’re indeed stunningly beautiful, but you’re only at the Heavenly Body Tier. What does it matter even if you’ve reached the pinnacle level? I can suppress you with a single hand!’ With this in mind, the senior disciple lashed out with a single hand.

Weng!

A silver river appeared in the air. It was brilliant and dazzling, and there were countless heavenly bodies pulsating within it.

It was easy to see that Eternal River Tier elites possessed a crushing advantage over Heavenly Body Tier cultivators.

Empress Luan Xing naturally wouldn’t face his attack head-on. Although her battle prowess was on par with the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier, her power was still a massive weakness.

Xiu!

She launched a strike using her brick.

The punch of the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple arrived, yet its power was surprisingly absorbed by the brick. Taking advantage of the momentum, the empress then flicked the brick at the senior disciple.

Pa!

The brick slammed into his face, sending him flying backward.

The five newly arrived senior disciples were all stunned. The battle prowess of Empress Luan Xing was clearly within expectations and far weaker than that of the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple, so why had he been sent flying after just a single exchange?

What precious treasure was that? It was far too powerful, was it not?

After flying for 30 or so meters, the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple straightened his body and stabilized his movements. He was an Eternal River Tier elite, after all, and he had only been taken by surprise. It wasn’t as if he were genuinely weaker than the empress.

He was absolutely furious at this moment. His silver hair stood on ends, and his killing intent was almost tangible as it proliferated into the surroundings.

So what if the empress charming and beautiful? He couldn’t swallow this humiliation!

“Pu!” However, when the other disciples saw his face, they couldn’t help but splutter and laugh out loud.

“Ancestor Wenxin... Achievements that stun for all eternity... Suppressing the chaos... Remembered forever...” someone read. These were the words that were printed on the face of the silver-haired and golden-horned senior disciple. However, they were naturally reversed.

What was the Absolute Beginning Stone? Apart from absorbing attacks, its only other specialty was being incredibly hard. It had no other use. Thus, people used these stones as tablets to record the mighty achievements of their clan or ancestor.

“Hahaha!” The surrounding disciples couldn’t help but burst into laughter. The words “Ancestor Wenxin” were far too large and clear.
