3230 Rescue

Ling Han was too famous now.

Half of the people in Huju City had witnessed the battle with their own eyes – who didn’t know the freakish man who had defeated Tuoba Tianhuang?

And in Hu Qiu’s case, he also knew Ling Han’s other identity—Huan Xue’s master.

He couldn’t understand why a beautiful cultivator, and one that was likely to become an alchemist or formation master at that, would be willing to be a servant!

No matter where she was, Huan Xue could become the center of attention. Why should she become Ling Han’s slave?

However, to Hu Qiu, Ling Han was only a vice-captain of the Xuanqing Banner who could fight well. Compared to the Hu Clan, he was far, far inferior.

Thus, he had always wanted to make a move on Huan Xue, but because of Mercy Medicine Hall, he did not dare to take her by force.

Unexpectedly, Little Nineteen gave him a surprise and asked him to “rescue” Huan Xue out of the fire pit. Most importantly, she really had left Mercy Medicine Hall.

He ran over to take a look and saw that Huan Xue was walking the dog, no, the pig. He immediately snatched her back and prepared to get married that night, making Huan Xue his eighth concubine.

Once what was done was done, he would just have to compensate Ling Han with some money, at most.

The Hu Clan was not short of money.

However, what he did not expect was that Ling Han had actually come to the Hu Residence.

He had a guilty conscience and didn’t have any domineering bearing left. He couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

“Wu wu wu wu, wu wu wu!” The bride struggled excitedly, but it was obvious at a glance that her hands and feet were definitely tied. Even when she walked, she could only take small steps. Her head was also covered with a red veil, so her appearance could not be seen.

It was definitely Huan Xue. Although she couldn’t see Ling Han, hearing Hu Qiu’s words, she naturally knew that Young Master had come to save her. This made her extremely excited.

Ling Han pointed at the bride, and said, “Lift up her veil.”

“The wedding hasn’t even started, how can we remove the veil?” an elder said. He was an elder of the Hu Clan, but his cultivation level had always been stuck at the peak of Meridian Opening, unable to advance into the Blood Transformation Tier and become the fourth elder of the Hu Clan.

However, his attitude was very unyielding.

This was the Hu Clan. No one could be arrogant and reckless.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Then I will do it for you.”

“Don’t you dare!” Hu Qiu hurriedly said. If someone else lifted the bride’s veil, would he still have the face to survive in the future?

Ling Han strode over, and said, “You stole my maid and forced her to marry you, and you still dare to be arrogant?” He stretched out a hand, and a terrifying force shook. Peng, peng, peng, the people in front of him instantly fell to the ground.

Hu Chaosheng had already climbed to his feet. With a loud roar, he charged towards Ling Han.

Boom, purple blood and Qi rose from his entire body, making him seem like a great demon.

His blood and Qi boiled!

This guy was going all out, using the unique ability of the Blood Transformation Tier. As his blood and Qi boiled, his strength increased explosively by two to three times, and both his eyes turned purple, looking incomparably fierce.

Ling Han did not dare to be careless. After boiling his blood and Qi, Hu Chaosheng’s strength was about 500,000 kilograms. He definitely could not be underestimated.

He also channeled all the mystical power in his body. The small meridians connected all the big meridians as if he only had one meridian in his body.

Punch.

BANG!

When their fists collided, both of their strengths exceeded the speed of sound. Under the superposition of the sound waves, the force of their blows became visible to the naked eye as they fiercely collided.

Ling Han’s power transformed into a huge fist. The power of the fist was extremely solid, and could be seen with the naked eye. Hu Chaosheng’s power paused for a moment, and then shattered. However, Ling Han’s fist only had a few more cracks, and continued to crush towards Hu Chaosheng.

“What!” Hu Chaosheng exclaimed, his expression turning extremely ugly.

BANG!

He crossed his arms in front of his chest. Under the violent force, his figure was forced back, shoveling and crushing the tiles on the floor of the hall until he stopped at the foundations of the hall.

Because he had hit the wall. Bang! The entire hall shook.

Everyone’s expressions were the same as Hu Chaosheng’s, filled with disbelief.

Third Elder’s blood and Qi was already boiling, and he had unleashed his strength to the extreme, yet he was still no match for Ling Han?

Was this guy really in the Meridian Opening Tier?

In terms of shock, no one could compare to Hu Chaosheng, because only he knew how powerful that attack was.

450,000 kg!

However, he was still forced back by Ling Han’s punch, which meant that the latter’s strength definitely exceeded 500,000kg.

Normally speaking, the average power of a Third Change cultivator was only 500,000 kg. A Meridian Opening Tier cultivator was actually comparable to a Third Change?

Then if this guy advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier, just how terrifying would his power reach?

Ling Han walked past Hu Qiu, who was trembling all over, but did not dare to stop him at all. He could only watch helplessly as Ling Han lifted the bride’s veil, revealing a pretty face. Who else could it be but Huan Xue?

However, the little handmaiden’s mouth was now gagged. No wonder she didn’t make a sound just now. Her eyes were red from crying, and she looked extremely excited.

Young Master had come to save her.

Ling Han turned Huan Xue around, and saw that the little maid’s hands were tied behind her back. This was a silver chain, and it was unknown what material it was made of.

He pulled hard and realized that he could not break the chain.

Eh, it was really sturdy.

Ling Han undid the chain, and then the little handmaiden pulled out the cloth that was stuffed in her mouth. With a face full of grievance and apology, she said, “Huan Xue is too useless. I still need Young Master to save me.”

This girl.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “This isn’t Huan Xue’s fault; it is just that some people are too detestable.”

“Yes, yes, yes.” Huan Xue nodded continuously. This person was too despicable. He actually wanted to forcefully marry her. She didn’t like him.

“AndLittle Piggy,” she sobbed. “They snatched him up and said they were going to make him into a roast suckling pig.”

She looked at Hu Qiu and said, “Give me back my piggy!”

Ling Han sighed. Just now, his aura was overflowing, but now that the little handmaiden had interrupted, the entire atmosphere had changed.

“Don’t worry about that fat pig. It won’t die,” he said calmly. That lecherous pig had thick skin and flesh. Even he couldn’t cut it open with the broken sword. Who could hurt it here?

At this moment, that lecherous pig was probably throwing itself into the arms of some girl and acting cute.

Ling Han looked at Hu Qiu, and calmly asked, “What else do you have to say?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This person had been caught red-handed. What else could he say?

Hu Qiu snorted and said, “Don’t forget, this is the Hu Clan!”

Just like how he did not dare to barge into the Mercy Medicine Hall back then, how could Ling Han possibly barge into the Hu Clan?

Although the strongest person in the Hu Clan was only at the Fourth Change, he was still slightly more impressive than Mo Guohao. After all, alchemists were subordinate to cultivators.

If you trespass into the Hu Clan, no one will be able to save you!

“Oh, you still don’t have the slightest intention of repenting even at this time?” Ling Han shook his head. “Then someone like you… deserves to die.”

“Humph, you dare to barge into my Hu Clan and threaten to kill?” A cold voice rang out, and a tall old man walked out from the inner hall. He walked in a majestic manner, and his Qi and blood was astonishing.
