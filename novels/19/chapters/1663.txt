Chapter 1664: Source of the Great River

“Natural Psychic Fruit!” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire licked his lips. “If it is capable of boosting cultivation up to Ascending Origin Tier, then that would be a supreme precious treasure to even me!”

“Grandpa Dog’s, it’s all Grandpa Dog’s!” The large black dog jumped out. “You damn kid, don’t you know how to respect your elders and betters?”

“I have not seen any betters, but I do see a shameless old dog.” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire laughed mockingly.

“You dare insult me? Woof!” The large black dog immediately broke into a fight with the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire.

Ling Han ignored this pair of jokers. He looked ahead. There was a black aura rising from the land. It was very calm, and a plant was presently growing about 10 miles ahead of them, exuding a shimmering Light of Dao.

Natural Psychic Fruit, the embodiment of the Regulations of heaven and earth. In theory, its value surpassed any other kind of Celestial medicine’s. Of course, if you were unlucky, and encountered one that was not mature enough, and could only boost your cultivation to Severing Mundane Tier, you could only cry.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu also looked ahead, but it was not looking at the Natural Psychic Fruit, but rather a farther area.

In truth, after 100 miles, even the vision of the Saints would start to fail them. They would only be able to see gusts of black Qi rising, whereas the other areas were all obscure.

As it watched, Xiao Gu’s expression involuntarily changed. Green light appeared from its eyes again, and it revealed an expression of fury.

Suddenly, it loudly roared, “Yiyaya!”

Then, it charged out.

Ling Han didn’t manage to stop it in time. He wanted to chase after it, but realized that the black aura had become as sharp as blades in the process of running, and posed a frightening threat to him. He could not execute the full effects of even the extreme speed of Lightning Flash.

He did not manage to stop it, and Xiao Gu had already charged to a very far spot like a gust of wind.

This guy... should not have gone off to die.

Ling Han slowly retreated. In this place, his physique was useless as well because even Immortal Palace Tiers could be killed, so how could his merely Half Star Pseudo Divine Metal physique be enough?

Gasp!

All the Saint Kings exclaimed in shock because Xiao Gu had already rushed six to seven miles ahead, far exceeding their limits.

This guy could possibly pluck the Celestial medicine!

Everyone was greatly pleased. As long as the Celestial medicine could be plucked, then they would have hopes of snatching it. Otherwise, they could only stay here and watch helplessly.

“Not good!” However, the masses soon cried out.

Xiao Gu’s body was crumbling, completely unable to bear the damage caused by this fatal land.

Ling Han, meanwhile, was not too worried. This body was only formed by Xiao Gu. Its true form was a bone. As long as its true form was not destroyed, it could easily form another body again.

Pa, pa, pa. Xiao Gu’s flesh and blood fell piece by piece, and very soon there was only a skeleton left behind, yet it was still running swiftly forwards.

It had already arrived at the side of the Celestial medicine.

But contrary to everyone’s expectations, Xiao Gu did not stop, and continued running forwards at a quick pace.

This...!

Everyone was baffled. ‘You have sacrificed so much, yet actually did not pluck the Celestial medicine right in front of you. Have you gone blind?’

Xiao Gu was still running. Its bones were falling off one after another, and finally there was only one left, and that was its true form, which was exuding a shimmering green light. It rushed into that boundless area of black aura.

The moment the distance of 100 miles was surpassed by it, no one was capable of catching sight of Xiao Gu. It had completely disappeared without a trace.

Everyone exchanged looks, their expressions completely dumbfounded. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

‘What the hell is this?’

Yet Ling Han came up with a thought. Xiao Gu was completely incompatible with the natives here, and the fundamental reason was the cultivation system of the natives here, and all this originated from the great river.

To be exact, it was the source of the great river.

And now, Xiao Gu was charging towards it!

No one could see what happened after that, and they could only wait.

After three days, they saw green light flickering in the distance. Xiao Gu very quickly appeared. Its whole body was encircled with green light. Of course, it was still just a bone, and charged out of the black aura at a run.

It stopped in front of Ling Han, and reformed flesh and blood. Then, it released a feeble “yiyaya”, and passed out.

Had Xiao Gu gone to the source of the great river? If yes, what had it encountered there? It seemed to have gone through a bloody battle, and sustained very severe injuries. It looked completely exhausted.

Everyone was curious, but Xiao Gu had not regained consciousness, so there was no one for them to ask.

Ling Han voiced a question to Small Tower, and asked, “Do you know what’s going on here?”

Small Tower was silent for a moment before answering, “This is a completely new cultivation system. I, too, have never heard of it. Different cultivation systems should correspond to a different natural environment; this is too bizarre.”

“Can you use the power of the Black Tower to help me enter into this area?” Ling Han asked again.

“If you think that you’ve lived long enough, you can give it a try,” Small Tower said, as sharp-tongued as it had always been.

Ling Han naturally would not take it to heart. Otherwise, he would have long since died of fury. He then asked, “Then what about Xiao Gu? Can you distinguish its origins?”

Again, Small Tower didn’t reply right away, and finally said, “I have some guesses. It should be related to a Celestial King, but as for the details, I am not very sure, either. After all, I have not completely recovered.”

Related to a Celestial King!

Ling Han was stunned, but immediately nodded. The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire had said that this black aura was capable of even killing Immortal Palace Tiers, so it was very possible that it could be battle prowess on the level of Celestial King Tier. Then, seeing as Xiao Gu was able to enter and return from it, it could be imagined that it had some relation with a Celestial King.

Three days later, Xiao Gu regained consciousness.

“Yiyaya!” It seemed to have completely forgotten the matter of its previous injuries, and called out happily, looking very energetic.

This recovery ability was really quite incredible.

“Xiao Gu, what did you see inside?” Ling Han asked.

Xiao Gu said “yiyaya” for a while. It only knew how to imitate speech, and the only phrase it could say independently was “yiyaya”. After making signs and gesturing for a long time, there was still no conclusion, which made everyone extremely anxious.

“I really want to bite this guy!” the large black dog muttered, but he was only grumbling. He definitely did not dare do such a thing. His eyes were very sharp, and he could tell how extraordinary Xiao Gu was.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “Xiao Gu, do you know how to do this?” He plucked out a portion of his memories, and turned it into images.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu immediately nodded. It also drew out a finger, and a memory image immediately appeared.

“Fast forward a bit.”

“Fast forward a bit.”

Very quickly, the scene of Xiao Gu charging into the black aura appeared. Ling Han did not ask it to fast forward again, but was rather watching with full concentration.

The others were also the same. They were almost killed by their curiosity. What kind of secret was actually hidden within this black aura? And what was there at the source of the great river? Why was it that a river could nurture so many elites, and a completely different cultivation system had even appeared?

They saw that as Xiao Gu charged into the black aura, there was very quickly only a bone left, and it was releasing green light, which resisted the corrosive ability of the black aura. It charged forwards.

However, Xiao Gu’s speed was also gradually slowing. This black aura exerted a tremendous pressure on it.

When even Xiao Gu could no longer bear it, and could only turn back, the great river had reached its source, and a massive black shadow appeared ahead.

That was... a corpse!
