Chapter 1086: Venting Anger

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was definitely a legend in the Scarlet Heaven Academy.

He had only entered the academy for a mere two years, yet he had already reached the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier. Moreover, he possessed an astonishing battle prowess, and he was perhaps a legendary five-star genius. His feats were even more astounding as he had not only fought frequently against the only child of Great General Zhao, but he had even had the upper hand when clashing with him. The empress had more so appointed him as a seventh-rank military officer.

Ling Han was the youngest seventh-rank military officer in the history of the Majestic Empire.

In fact, many students in the Eastern Institution lamented why Ling Han had entered the academy so soon. If he had entered the Scarlet Heaven Academy five years later, wouldn’t he have become a prodigy of the Eastern Institution?

Yang Shuang faltered for a moment before roaring, “Ling Han, you actually dare to barge into our Eastern Institution?”

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Release him and return the sword. Then we can speak about other things!”

“Haha, this person is really your friend?” Yang Shuang chortled loudly, and stomped onto Jin Zhihui’s face before saying, “What if I don’t?”

He wasn’t afraid of Ling Han, as he had a battle prowess at the late stage of the consummate level. If Ling Han fought against him, he would merely be seeking humiliation.

A cold glint flashed across Ling Han’s eyes, and he said, “I’ll cut off that leg of yours.”

Yang Shuang roared with laughter. ‘What an absolute joke!’

Yang Shuang used the sword to point at Ling Han, and said, “Ling Han, are you feeling a little too good about yourself? Do you really think that you’re invincible in this academy?”

Ling Han didn’t reply, instead striding toward Yang Shuang. His expression was dark, and his rage had almost become tangible, making it difficult for those around him to breathe.

“Beat him to a pulp!” Yang Shuang roared.

Ling Han was kidding, right? This was the Eastern Institution!

“Go!”

The students from the Eastern Institution all charged over. They had actually allowed Ling Han to swagger all the way from the Northern Institution to the main gates of the Eastern Institution! This was utter humiliation, and if the students of the Eastern Institution allowed him to return safely, there would be no need for them to cultivate any longer—they might as well buy a block of tofu and slap themselves to death.

A dozen or so fists instantly smashed toward Ling Han.

Ling Han activated his divine patterns of gravity with a thought.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The assailants were unable to get near him, and were immediately pressed flat onto the floor by the overwhelming force of extreme gravity instead.

Following the increase of Ling Han’s cultivation level, his divine patterns of gravity also became more powerful. At the very least, they couldn’t be withstood by those under the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

He continued forward, and students around him fell like dominoes. Not a single person managed to pose any real threat to him.

Unease gripped at Yang Shuang’s heart. He was already standing face to face with Ling Han, and there were no more obstacles between the two of them.

Theoretically speaking, his battle prowess was higher than that of Ling Han, so he shouldn’t have been feeling any unease. However, he was experiencing an indescribable feeling of irritation for some reason, and this made him especially anxious.

“Kneel down and apologize to Brother Jin. If Brother Jin is willing to forgive you, then that will be the end of this matter. Otherwise, I’ll have you know the meaning of the word regret!” Ling Han’s voice was dripping with malice.

“Bullsh*t!” Yang Shuang flared up in rage. He lifted his foot off Jin Zhihui’s face and immediately launched a kick toward Ling Han.

Ling Han also threw a kick.

Peng!

Their legs collided, and both of them stumbled backward.

Yang Shuang was stunned, and he stammered, “Y-you broke through to the high extreme!”

Not only that, but Ling Han’s power was actually on par with his! His head went numb with shock.

He had cultivation at the middle stage of the consummate level, and his power was identical to his consummate level. His battle prowess could also surpass one star. His opponent was only at the early stage of the high extreme, yet his power was already on par with his. What did this signify?

This signified that Ling Han’s power could surpass five stars!

On the Joint Peace Planet, five-star geniuses only existed in legends. It was possible that the empress was a five-star genius, though no one had ever proved this to be true. Right now, however, someone was actually able to surpass five stars with their power alone! How could Yang Shuang not be shocked?

‘Won’t your battle prowess surpass six stars if you learn a few more ultimate techniques?

‘Moreover, it’s only been two years, yet you’ve already reached the high extreme! How can one cultivate so fast?’

“Kneel down!” Ling Han extended his hands toward Yang Shuang.

“Never! Never!” Yang Shuang shouted as he counterattacked. He definitely couldn’t allow himself to be defeated by Ling Han.

Ling Han’s fists and palms continued to rain down—they were as powerful as mountains, and as fierce as flames.

He realized that he had underestimated his own battle prowess.

Before he knew it, his power had already reached a stage where it could surpass five stars. Add to that his divine patterns of gravity and divine patterns of flame, and his battle prowess was already powerful enough to surpass six stars.

Of course, this was before taking into account his Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow or the Fast Technique.

At his peak, his battle prowess was completely capable of surpassing seven stars!

In fact, he could even fight against a cultivator at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier in a fair battle! Taking into account his physique and recovery ability, it was entirely possible for him to claim invincibility in the Mountain River Tier!

Ling Han activated his Fast Technique, and said, “If I want to suppress you, then you can only be suppressed!” His strikes were swift and fierce, and as his fingers moved, Sword Qi swept through the air like swords flying from beyond the highest heavens.

Yang Shuang howled in pain as he was continuously struck by Ling Han’s attacks. Blood sprayed through the air, and although his wounds were all shallow, he still appeared to be in an extremely sorry state.

Even Senior Brother Yang was being trampled on now—how many people in the Eastern Institution could still oppose Ling Han?

Peng!

Ling Han finally beat Yang Shuang down with a punch. He snatched the sword from his hands before helping Jin Zhihui back up, and saying, “Brother Jin, are you okay?”

“I’m fine, my wounds aren’t severe,” Jin Zhihui replied as he crawled up. Several of his bones were broken, but this was nothing serious to cultivators. If one had good quality pills, such wounds could be healed in just a few days.

Ling Han nodded before turning back to Yang Shuang, and saying, “I said that I would cut off that leg of yours. You didn’t think I was joking, did you?”

“You dare?!” Yang Shuang trembled in fright, and said, “This is the Eastern Institution! The academy won’t let you off lightly if you commit such acts of violence!”

Shua!

Ling Han unsheathed the sword. There was a flash of sword light, and one of Yang Shuang’s legs had already been cut off.

“This is my friend. Moreover, this sword was also specially delivered over by my friend! You snatched my sword, so it’s only natural that I targeted you. I’ve already given the academy face by not slicing your head off! Don’t you know that it’s a serious crime to steal from officials of the Majestic Empire?”

Yang Shuang only remembered to howl in pain after being dazed for a moment. After listening to Ling Han’s reasoning, he felt even more gloomy and depressed.

Just as Ling Han had said, it was a serious crime to steal from officials of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. However, the matter of him stealing the sword could be severe or insignificant. After all, the sword hadn’t been delivered to Ling Han yet. If his battle prowess had been enough to crush Ling Han, would Ling Han still have had the face to ask for the sword to be given back? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The problem was, he had actually been defeated by Ling Han! That being the case, he could only swallow the huge loss of having a leg cut off.

Fortunately, regrowing severed limbs wasn’t anything too difficult for those who had reached the Immortal level. One wouldn’t be crippled as long as their life force remained uninjured.

Pa!

Ling Han slapped Yang Shuang across the face, and said balefully, “Did you think this matter would end so easily? I was merely punishing you for stealing my sword just then. Now, I’m helping Brother Jin vent his anger!”

Pa, pa, pa!

He continued to slap Yang Shuang across the face.

Pu, pu, pu!

Yang Shuang’s teeth were all knocked out, and his face was caked with blood. It was a truly devastating sight.

“Enough!” A youth dashed over at this moment, his face filled with intense displeasure.
