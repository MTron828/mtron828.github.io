Chapter 2110: The True Roc Heaven

Lu Hairong had a mysterious feeling of trust for Ling Han, and when he said that he could find the ancient battlefield, she didn’t feel the slightest hint of doubt at all. She directly followed his lead.

When entering the Roc Heaven, they didn’t forget to release Chen Shuangshuang. She would return to the Heavenly Saint Palace by herself.

Accompanying Ling Han and the others would be far too dangerous. However, if she were by herself, no one would pay attention to her at all.

Ling Han also wanted to immediately go to the Heavenly Saint Palace to visit his son. However, if the force of darkness managed to obtain the Source Power of heaven and earth, and used it to expand and stabilize the two realms’ passageway, the Celestial Realm would tread one step closer to destruction.

“Can’t we also invade that realm?” Ling Han asked.

Since that realm could assault them, why couldn’t the elites of the Celestial Realm launch a counterattack on that realm?

“Because they’re more powerful!” Small Tower replied.

This was a simple and clear-cut answer. Regardless of where one was, might would always be right.

“Just how powerful are they?” Ling Han asked.

“…In our world, there can only be a maximum of four Heavenly Venerates at any one time. Currently, there are three Heavenly Venerates. In that world… there are a total of seven Heavenly Venerates!” Small Tower replied. This was the brutal truth.

Seven Heavenly Venerates!

The gulf between their battle prowess was far too great.

Ling Han immediately shut up. If he wanted to save the Celestial Realm from danger, his only option was to become a Heavenly Venerate. Otherwise, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were only cannon fodder. They couldn’t even withstand a single strike from Heavenly Venerates.

“Are Heavenly Venerates truly this powerful?” he asked in curiosity.

“Perhaps 10 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings can block a single Heavenly Venerate. Moreover, they need to be the most top-notch Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.” Small Tower pondered for a moment before adding, “Take note, they can only block the Heavenly Venerate, not rival the Heavenly Venerate.”

Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could stand shoulder to shoulder with heaven and earth, while Heavenly Venerates were beings who were transcendent above heaven and earth. They weren’t subject to the restrictions of heaven and earth.

“In other words, even if this heaven and earth is destroyed, the Heavenly Venerates won’t be killed?” Ling Han suddenly asked.

“Correct,” Small Tower said with a nod. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. No wonder Small Tower and the large black dog would occasionally grumble about those old geezers not caring about the beings in this world. In reality, they wouldn’t be killed even if calamity befell the world. In fact, they could continue to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle in the other realm. That being the case, they naturally wouldn’t fight with their lives on the line.

“Stop, it’s right here,” Small Tower suddenly said.

“Stop, stop, stop!” Ling Han hurriedly shouted.

Lu Hairong stopped and let everyone down.

“Here?” she asked in slight surprise.

This was a harsh expanse of land, and there wasn’t even a single pebble in sight. How could the ancient battlefield be here?

“Small Tower?” Ling Han asked in his mind.

“There!” Small Tower said as it pointed in a certain direction.

After walking for a while, they came to a stop. The surroundings were still bare.

“Idiot! I already told you that the ancient battlefield has been pushed into the void. Only a passageway remains here, and one can enter this passageway to find that ancient battlefield.”

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu suddenly called.

Ling Han knew that if Xiao Gu wasn’t mimicking someone, he would only speak if he was enraged. If he was enraged, this often signified the presence of a cultivator who had adopted the other cultivation system.

Force of darkness!

The Celestial King Bone inside Xiao Gu’s body started to glow. One after another, numerous brilliant symbols lit up on his chest. He reached forward and tore at the void.

This was clearly empty space, yet under Xiao Gu’s hands, it was as if there genuinely was a wall that was being torn down.

Lu Hairong squinted her eyes, and said, “Regulations of Space.”

Apart from Celestial Kings who had obtained dao by practicing the Regulations of Space, ordinary Celestial Kings would only have enough time and resources to practice other great dao after reaching the Ninth Heaven.

Those from the Roc Palace naturally cultivated the Regulations of Space since they all possessed the bloodline of the Roc. Moreover, they possessed the corresponding cultivation techniques and secret techniques, and this was also a reason why they were so powerful. The Regulations of Space were more powerful than other Regulations.

However, Lu Hairong was shocked to discover that she couldn’t understand Xiao Gu’s Regulations of Space at all!

This signified that Xiao Gu’s cultivation level was higher.

She was extremely curious at this moment. While he was alive, which Celestial King had Xiao Gu been?

After a brief moment, Xiao Gu had already forcefully torn open a passageway to the void.

The space of the Celestial Realm was initially extremely stable. Even intense battles between Ascending Origin Tier elites could barely open a passageway to the void. However, Xiao Gu had succeeded.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu shouted with an expression of fury. With a leap, he directly entered the passageway.

Lu Hairong only hesitated for a brief moment before grabbing everyone and venturing inside.

It wasn’t long before the entrance to the passageway started to slowly knit back together. It was as if it had never existed.

Heaven and earth possessed a powerful recovery ability.

Boom, boom, boom!

In the void, waves of energy chaotically surged about.

There was indeed no physical matter in the void. However, there were waves of chaotic energy everywhere, and these waves of energy formed a terrifying gale. Even Ascending Origin Tier elites would be instantly torn into shreds by this gale.

Fortunately, they had the protection of a Celestial King. Their safety could be guaranteed.

Xiao Gu was leading them, and his body transformed into a streak of light as his speed grew quicker and quicker. In fact, even Lu Hairong started to struggle to keep up.

He was merely a bone, yet his might was still so overwhelming. This was incredibly astonishing.

While alive, just how powerful had this Celestial King been?

Fortunately, Lu Hairong was a Celestial King who was skilled in the Regulations of Space. Otherwise, if it were any other Fourth Heaven Celestial King, they definitely wouldn’t be able to keep up with Xiao Gu.

However, even with the incredible speed of the two Celestial Kings, they still spent an entire seven days and seven nights flying through the void. Only then did a small dot finally appear in their sight.

There was actually something in the void! Moreover, it hadn’t been obliterated!

After flying for another half a day, the small dot finally started to continually expand in size. It went from a small dot to a pancake, and finally from a pancake to an indescribably large continent.

“This is the true Roc Heaven!” Lu Hairong exclaimed in astonishment.

During that battle, the entire Roc Heaven had been pushed into the void. The current Roc Heaven had been rebuilt on an expanse of ruined land.

This was a Heavenly Realm, so it was naturally exorbitantly large. Even a Celestial King couldn’t capture this entire continent with their gaze.

Whoosh!

Xiao Gu was the first to land on the continent, and Lu Hairong hurriedly followed behind him.

‘Huh?’

Ling Han and the others were astonished to discover that there was no chaotic gale here.

“This continent has blocked the energy gale. Far too many Celestial Kings died here during that battle, and this place is a mass graveyard for Celestial Kings!”

Indeed, this place was a graveyard for Celestial Kings. Countless Celestial Kings were buried here, and their existence gave birth to countless possibilities.

Xiao Gu descended into a state of confusion. Because there had been no other matter in the void, the power of darkness had been as clear as the sun. After arriving here, however, the aura of Celestial Kings blotted out the sun. This caused him to lose his lead.

“Then we’ll search slowly,” Ling Han said with a smile.

However, just how difficult would it be to find a few people on such a vast continent?

“Try to cover every corner possible. Once I sense the Source Power of heaven and earth, I can naturally find the members of the force of darkness,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. This was their only option.

They started to wander around the continent. Fortunately, there was a Celestial King with them, so their speed was incredibly high. However, if they wanted to search every corner of the continent, this naturally couldn’t be done in a single sweep. They would need to sweep around billions of times.

After three entire years, Small Tower suddenly shouted, “Stop!”
