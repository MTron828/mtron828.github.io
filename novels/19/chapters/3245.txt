3246 Killing Hu Can

“In your dreams!” Hu Can sneered. “Today, I will kill all of you!”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The battle between the two became more and more intense.

Ling Han had kept a constant guard up against the other party’s power burst. The power of a Five Change of Blood Transformation Tier would give a sudden boost of power by more than twofold. That destructive power was absolutely terrifying.

However, Hu Can was incomparably calm. He actually did not let his blood and Qi boil the entire time.

“Ling Han, don’t worry about his boiling blood and Qi,” Butler Mu said, panting. “Previously, he relied on boiling blood and Qi to intensify my injuries. At least for three hours, it’s impossible for him to erupt again.”

‘I see.’

Ling Han nodded. It was no wonder that although Hu Can was enraged, he did not use his power burst.

“Old b@stard, so you don’t have any more trump cards!” He laughed.

Hu Can sneered. “So what? I’m a Five Change. My power is far above yours, and my endurance is also far above yours. If the battle persists, you’ll definitely die!”

“So what? I have a precious pig in my hand!” Ling Han said with a smile.

When the lecherous pig heard this, it immediately raised its head proudly. It was indeed a precious pig, extremely noble and valuable.

Hu Can raised his eyebrows, and his killing intent rose uncontrollably.

This pig!

Now, his hatred for this pig in fact surpassed his hatred towards Ling Han. In the ten minutes-long battle just now, this pig had been spitting saliva at him, and this was beyond his tolerance.

“Damn pig!” he said fiercely. He swore in his heart that after he killed Ling Han and the others, he would definitely slaughter this damned pig and eat it!

If it couldn’t be cut open, so be it. He would just steam it directly.

The two of them fought again. This time, Ling Han no longer had any misgivings, and naturally brandished his sword even more forcefully. However, Hu Can was still a Fifth Change, and he also held a Spirit Tool in his hand, so his battle prowess was not inferior to his at all.

The battle was still in a stalemate, but Ling Han was becoming more and more confident.

Actually, even if he didn’t use the little pink pig, his battle prowess wouldn’t be much inferior to Hu Can’s. After all, doing so would be equivalent to tying up one of his arms, limiting a portion of his battle prowess.

Firstly, the defense of this lecherous pig was simply heaven-defying, and could reduce Ling Han’s excessive consumption of power. Secondly, it was the ability to spray saliva. It was simply the strongest form of ridicule. Who wouldn’t fly into a rage after being sprayed with saliva by a pig?

Sure enough, Ling Han’s patience gradually paid off. In his rage, Hu Can desperately squandered his power, wanting to defeat Ling Han in one fell swoop. However, in the face of the lecherous pig’s invincible defense, this was just a waste of energy. Instead, Ling Han seized the opportunity to counterattack, adding a few more wounds to his body.

Moreover, it was naturally impossible for his defense to be perfect with his infuriated state. Ling Han’s insight had not declined, and his ability to catch flaws was naturally top-notch. After a few slashes, Hu Can had a few more injuries.

After fighting for a while more, Hu Can was finally reminded by the pain and no longer attacked blindly.

He realized that such a forceful attack was meaningless. Not only would it not be able to injure Ling Han, it would only deform his defense and consume his power.

But how could it be that he was going to leave just like that?

One had to know that he had been rude to an Extreme Bone Tier elite and had had improper thoughts about the beloved daughter of a City Lord. If word got out, it would be enough to kill him a hundred times over.

If he left now, he could forget about staying in the Dark North Nation in the future.

No, he didn’t want to be a savage that would be hunted.

Hu Can’s eyes were bloodshot. Kill! He had to kill all of them.

The Hu Clan had just been annihilated, and all his hard work had been wasted. He was already in a state of emotional turmoil, and now that he had been stimulated by the little pink pig’s saliva, his mentality had long been unbalanced.

There was only one thing on his mind right now, and that was to kill!

“Die, all of you!” Hu Can brandished his longsword crazily. His calmness disappeared in a flash, and he became even more violent.

Facing such a madman, Ling Han had no choice but to be careful. Otherwise, if he was really struck, the might of a Spirit Tool combined with the power of a Fifth Change would be enough to kill him.

Fight, fight, fight. The two of them continued to fight fiercely, their battle accompanied by blood.

Facing Hu Can’s madness, Ling Han was also unable to remain completely uninjured. He was also blasted a few times, and inevitably bled. However, compared to Hu Can, he was much better.

This was because he had the little pink pig to block the attacks, but Hu Can could only neutralize them on his own. In a head-on clash, how could he neutralize and dodge every attack?

More and more wounds appeared on Hu Can’s body, and blood flowed all over the ground.

As he had lost too much blood, Hu Can’s expression turned uglier and uglier. He revealed a look of fear.

If this continued, he would die.

He wanted to save face and take revenge. After his clan was destroyed, his emotions were on the verge of madness. However, once he was really about to face death, he was afraid.

Compared to his life, everything else was nothing. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He didn’t want revenge anymore. He didn’t want prosperity anymore. He just wanted to live well and spend the rest of his life in peace.

At the thought of this, he suddenly turned around and ran.

“I’ve been waiting for you!” Ling Han smiled, and with a wave of his left hand, he threw the fat pig towards Hu Can. He channeled Shuttle Steps, and his speed instantly soared, reaching the speed of sound.

Peng, the sonic boom exploded, and the surrounding grass immediately collapsed, while the river on the other side swept up huge waves.

The little lecherous pig let out a blood-curdling scream, but it unavoidably collided with Hu Can, causing Hu Can to stagger. This was something that Ling Han had smashed out with the force of 500,000 kilograms, so how could it not be powerful?

However, Hu Can made up his mind to escape. After steadying himself, he broke into a run again.

However, at this moment, he felt a chill at his back. Then, all the strength in his body seemed to have disappeared. It was difficult for him to even take a step.

He felt a pain in his chest and looked down. Yet, it looked normal.

Pu!

Ling Han pulled out the broken sword, and fresh blood instantly spurted out from Hu Can’s back.

If one was stabbed in his vitals by the broken sword, he would definitely die.

Hu Can slowly turned around. He looked at Ling Han blankly, his eyes filled with confusion.

…How did Ling Han catch up to him?

Impossible. Even if he was hit, he had the speed of sound, so how could Ling Han have caught up to him?

Peng, he fell to the ground, his life ended.

Ling Han put away the broken sword. He had long expected that someone like Hu Can would definitely be afraid of death, so he had been waiting for him to escape. Then, he would use Shuttle Steps to chase after him and give him the last blow.

Hu Can naturally would not have thought that Ling Han had already mastered a movement technique in just two days.

He was too smart for his own good.

Ling Han let out a long breath. A Fifth Change was truly difficult to kill. He could be said to have used up all his means, and only then did he use a loophole in the other party’s knowledge about him to kill him.

But when he turned around, he saw Butler Mu and Feng Ruoxian looking at him as if they were looking at a ghost.
