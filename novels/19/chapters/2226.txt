Chapter 2227: Eye

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At least two hours later, Ling Han finally released his hold.

He could feel stickiness on his face, and when he touched it, he discovered that his hand was actually covered with bloody scabs.

When he had been standing off against the heaven and earth’s willpower inside that creature, his physical body actually could not bear it any longer. Blood flowed continuously from his orifices, and that was why his whole face was covered in blood.

He shook his body, and not only was it his face, blood had also seeped out of his body all over, all congealing into bloody scabs, and almost turning him into a monster as well.

However, as he was sustaining the barrage of Regulations of a foreign creature, it was the same for that creature, yet it was not as strong as Ling Han, and had already turned into a corpse. Every single inch of its body had cracked apart, yet it was exuding a refreshing fragrance.

Actually, Ling Han had not been standing off against this creature, but rather the Regulations of this place, and the result was that he had barely managed to resist them.

After all, this was willpower of heaven and earth. The fact that he hadn’t been killed was already a display of his absolute strength.

“This is… Celestial medicine!” Lu Zhen suddenly exclaimed. He spread apart the body of that creature, and there was actually a tiny herb nurtured in its heart. It had born seven fruits, and the refreshing fragrance was exuded from the fruits.

Ling Han took it out for a look, and his brow involuntarily wrinkled in a frown. “This Celestial medicine should be corresponding to this space, so it would probably be very hard to benefit us if we were to ingest it.” He pondered for a while, and still passed two fruits to Lu Zhen and Mei Hua, “Just take it first and we’ll see.”

Lu Zhen and Mei Hua naturally would not refuse. No matter how strange it was, a celestial medicine was still a celestial medicine.

They did not dare say anything about how Ling Han had taken five fruits for himself, because this creature had been killed by Ling Han alone. Even if he had not given them anything, it would’ve been completely acceptable.

That was a celestial medicine, so giving them a portion was already extremely generous.

Ling Han stowed away the celestial medicine, as well as the corpse of this creature. He was very intrigued by this place, and planned to study it carefully.

They continued onwards, and arrived at their targeted area. Then, they began a careful observation, drafting the map.

“Young Master Han, come and look.” Lu Zhen suddenly ran over.

Ling Han walked off with him, and saw there was a small dark cave in one of the walls of the valley.

“That’s it?” Ling Han was surprised. What was so interesting about this?

“Young Master Han, patience,” Lu Zhen said.

After a long while of waiting,?hu, Ling Han suddenly felt a great pull, which sucked him towards that cave. He hurriedly channeled the power of Regulation, and his body immediately stopped. However, Lu Zhen did not have that kind of strength, and his body was rapidly falling forwards.

Thankfully, he had long since prepared himself. As he moved his body to get rid of the force, he prevented his body from falling.

However, this sucking force only persisted for a while, and soon disappeared.

“Strange!” Ling Han went to the cave mouth, and extended his divine sense inwards.

His divine sense entered for over 50 km, and there was not the slightest change with the cave mouth. It was extremely narrow, and when it reached over 500 km, this was already close to Ling Han’s limits. In this heaven and earth, his divine sense would also be greatly restricted.

He could still continue further, yet suddenly a feeling of danger rose up in him, and his divine sense abruptly returned inside his body like a subsiding tide.

A chill suddenly assaulted him. Ling Han felt as if he had been targeted by some dangerous thing. This feeling was extremely bad, causing sweat to break out on his forehead involuntarily, and his back was damp with sweat as well.

He looked again at that cave mouth, and all his hair was suddenly standing on ends.

An eye!

He saw an eye that was focused on him, emotionless and cold.

“Young Master Han!” Lu Zhen hurriedly approached, and also looked towards the cave mouth, but he did not see anything.

Ling Han waved a hand, and then glanced back at the cave mouth again. This time, he did not see anything.

“We leave immediately.”

Though Lu Zhen was slightly confused, they had more or less completed their mission, so he did not raise any objections. Moreover, it was useless even if he did object. How could he influence Ling Han’s decision?

They called Mei Hua over, and practically fled in a panic.

Only at the moment they stepped out of the valley did the chill in Ling Han’s heart gradually retreat.

He could be certain that that was definitely not an illusion.

Beneath this valley, a terrifying creature was hidden.

To cause such wariness from a First Secret monarch star like himself, it would definitely surpass the level of the Immortal Palace Tier.

An Ascending Origin Tier?

But didn’t this heaven and earth only permit beings of the Immortal Palace Tier?

No, this heaven and earth had just formed recently, and the Regulations were also evolving. In that case, what would be so strange about Ascending Origin Tier creatures coming into being? However, the Regulations had not been perfected, after all, so that creature was not able to emerge, and could only spy on them.

Otherwise, perhaps he, too, would not have been able to leave the valley just now.

…Of course, if he did not mind exposing the Black Tower, that Ascending Origin Tier creature would not be able to threaten him, either.

‘I have to improve my physique as soon as possible,’ Ling Han thought.

However, at his present level, the improvement of his physique was not something that could be accomplished as simply as being struck by lightning, but would rather need endless amounts of celestial medicines working together with the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to temper his physique. In other words, he needed money.

Money, money, money, he was really lacking money.

“Why have you guys come back?” Shen Chao appeared, his eyes sweeping over Ling Han and the others, a hint of displeasure in his expression.

“The mission is complete,” Ling Han stated calmly, and threw over the map that they had drafted.

Shen Chao grabbed it, and swept over it with his divine sense, yet he could not show any dissatisfaction, because this map had indeed been completed.

“I also have a matter to report to Lord Nie,” Ling Han continued.

Shen Chao immediately humphed. “You can report to me about whatever it is. Why do you have to skip over me to make your report to a higher official? Furthermore, is this map of yours accurate? It can’t be that you guys simply drafted it carelessly just to go through the motions, right?”

Ling Han frowned, and replied in displeasure, “I am not that idle.”

“You dare to quibble with me?” Shen Chao demanded menacingly, and his eyes immediately became dangerous.

Ling Han knew that the other man had a natural prejudice against students of Saintly Origin Academy, but knowing it was one thing. Why was there any need for him to humble himself in front of the other man? He stated calmly, “Aren’t you the one that is causing unnecessary trouble?”

“How dare you!!” Shen Chao shouted angrily, and suddenly moved to grab out at Ling Han.

He was a Fifth Secret monarch tier, and his strength was naturally world-shaking. Light of Dao blazed, as if he was a supreme overlord.

Ling Han was very strong. When he had been at Dividing Nine Souls, he had been equivalent to a First Secret Immortal Palace Tier, and now that he had further advanced into the Immortal Palace Tier, that was naturally equivalent to having formed his second Mystery Realm, but even if he was a monarch tier, that was only comparable to Third Secret, and there was still a very great gap between him and a Fifth Secret monarch tier.

Taking it head-on? That was only going to be suicidal!

Ling Han used Void Space, and manifested millions of himself.

Though he had split out the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, the brand of the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth had been left in his body, and the abilities he had grasped would not disappear. Instead, he could continue to deduce the secrets of the Source Powers through these brands.

Boom, Shen Chao’s grab completely missed its target.

Yet he only smirked coldly. That had only been a casual move of his, yet Ling Han had already used a powerful move. What did that signify?

In the outside world, it would not have much effect, but this was an independent zone. One could only expend the Regulations that were locked in their body, and this meant that every person’s battle prowess would be equivalent to a small pool. Once it was completely exhausted, they would be completely rendered useless.

At present, Ling Han could dodge his attacks as much as possible, but how long could he continue dodging for?

He moved mercilessly, wanting to push Ling Han to his limits as soon as possible.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
