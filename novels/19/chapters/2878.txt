2879 Outsider

When the red-haired man heard Qian Wang’s words, hope rose in his heart.

If he chose 10 pieces, what if he was lucky and all the pieces contained treasure, and the total value surpassed Qian Wang?

Sometimes, no matter how strong one was, he would still cry when he encountered someone with luck that was off the charts.

“Choose first,” Qian Wang said in an arrogant tone.

When he had still been a Celestial King1, he hadn’t even been able to see a Heavenly Venerate, but now he could be surrounded by Heavenly Venerates, and was treated with the utmost courtesy. This caused his favorable opinion of himself to spike sky-high.

Ling Han shook his head. This kind of person did not have the wisdom of Grandmaster Xuanlai. He could be willful and arrogant for now, but there was a 99% chance that he would die on the streets in the future.

“Sure,” Ling Han said nonchalantly as he casually walked around the vein of ore, and dug out 10 raw stones.

Qian Wang also started walking around. He walked back and forth a few times before finally choosing three raw stones.

The red-haired man and the others all shook their heads. There was definitely no chance now.

Look, the other grandmaster of raw stone had taken such a long time to make his choice, yet Ling Han had just randomly picked 10 stones. How could this be compared?

“Open the stone,” Qian Wang said calmly, putting on airs.

“Sure.” Ling Han began to cut the stone. His power was extremely strong, and he knew the contents like the back of his hand. Thus, in just a few breaths’ time, the contents appeared.

This was a Great Herb, green in color.

‘F*ck!’

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned. This luck was heaven-defying. A random stone could produce a supremely valuable medicine?

Hope was reignited in the red-haired man. Green Great Herbs were extremely precious. Even if Ling Han’s remaining nine raw stones were all useless, he might still be able to win with this Great Herb.

The mouths of Mi Wenbai and the rest twitched. So what if he was a grandmaster of raw stone? He was no match against such good luck, right?

Qian Wang’s mouth was half gaping. He wasn’t a first-generation grandmaster of raw stone like Grandmaster Xuanlai, but belonged to the generation of his disciples and grand-disciples. They had some skills in stone gambling, but their abilities were far inferior to Grandmaster Xuanlai’s.

He knew that there were treasures contained in the three raw stones he had chosen, but he had no idea what these treasures were.

Ling Han’s first move was a green Great Herb, completely disrupting his plans, and causing him to start panicking.

How could Ling Han care about him? He continued to cut another raw stone.

“Here’s another treasure!” everyone exclaimed.

The second raw stone still revealed a Great Herb, but the grade was slightly inferior to the first. It was only blue.

However, with two Great Herbs in front of him, Ling Han was practically unbeatable.

Mi Wenbai and the others were about to fall into despair. What kind of luck did Ling Han have? Wasn’t his luck a bit too good?

The third, fourth, and fifth raw stones were also cut one by one. They all contained Great Herbs. Not only did two green ones appear, but there was also a yellow one, which shocked and made everyone’s eyes turn bloodshot.

Qian Wang had already flopped onto the ground. Unless he unearthed three Heavenly Venerable Seals in a row, he would definitely lose.

However, Ling Han then unearthed four Heavenly Venerable Seals in a row, completely cutting off his hopes.

“I, I admit defeat,” Qian Wang said in a bitter tone. He looked meaningfully at Ling Han. This guy was definitely pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger2. He refused to believe that anyone’s luck was this good even if someone threatened to twist his head off if he did not.

This was already expected, but hearing Qian Wang admit defeat personally, everyone still felt a sense of absurdity about the whole situation.

Could it be that Ling Han was also a grandmaster of raw stone?

However, who didn’t know that it was impossible for a Heavenly Venerate to become a grandmaster of raw stone? That was absolutely impossible. However, no one would believe that Ling Han’s luck was so heaven-defying, either.

Ling Han smiled faintly, but didn’t act ruthlessly. He turned around, and said to Ling Jianxue, “What are you waiting for? Hurry up.”

The red-haired man and the others also came to their senses as if they had just woken up from a dream. Ling Han had won, so this vein of raw stone naturally belonged to them now, so they could start choosing stones.

“Wait!” However, just as they were about to move, they heard a voice that carried an extremely terrifying pressure.

Who was it?

Everyone turned around and saw two people walking over. One of them looked to be in his twenties. He had a handsome face and a slender figure. He emanated boundless light, and his breath was filled with the air of Primal Chaos. He was incomparably terrifying.

Meanwhile, the person beside him was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He seemed insignificant beside his companion’s aura, but everyone’s eyes were fixed on him.

This was because he was the grandmaster of raw stone that the red-haired man had invited previously, and Ling Han had driven him off in fury. They had not expected that not only had he returned, he had even brought an outsider with him.

Clearly, they did not come with good intentions.

“Who are you?” the red-haired man asked.

Mi Wenbai and the others, on the other hand, acted as if it had nothing to do with them. In any case, this vein of ore already belonged to Ling Han and the others, so they were happy to just sit by and watch the show.

Peng!

The response to the red-haired man was a punch from the young man. It was unstoppable, and sent the red-haired man flying.

“A mere Second Tier dares to be presumptuous in front of me!” the young man said coldly. His gaze swept over, and a terrifying aura spread out, causing everyone to involuntarily lower their gazes, not daring to meet his eyes.

“I’m Nalan De.” He retracted his gaze. “Everything here belongs to me. You people can get lost.”

Yet Ling Jianxue looked at the grandmaster of raw stone beside him, and said, “Grandmaster Hou, we agreed that you had to keep this a secret!”

Grandmaster Hou sneered. “You publicly humiliated me and want me to keep it a secret for you. How laughable.”

Peng!

The force of a punch surged over, and Grandmaster Hou was immediately turned into a rain of blood.

Ling Han retracted his fist, and casually dusted it off.

Hiss, this guy was really bold. He killed just like that, not giving Nalan De any face at all.

Nalan De’s expression darkened. He was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and could suppress everyone here single-handedly, but Ling Han actually dared to kill someone in front of him, and the man he had killed was one of his own at that, so how could he not be angry?

He said menacingly, “How dare you, you even dare to—”

Peng! He hadn’t even finished speaking when he saw Ling Han’s fist fly towards him.

“You’re courting death!” Nalan De humphed coldly, and threw out his own fist to meet the attack.

As he saw it, the power of his punch could instantly destroy Ling Han’s attack, and then continue to attack without any loss of power, blasting Ling Han into pieces.

Boom!

The two forces collided, but the result was completely different from what Nalan De had imagined.

The power of his fist had collapsed with a single blow, and the force of Ling Han’s punch was still surging over explosively.

‘What?!’

He turned pale with fright, and then looked at Ling Han. His entire body was glowing with the light of seals, and there were over 100 of them.

This was…

Boom! Power gushed over, and he was instantly blasted into a rain of blood. So what if he had been tempered by three fundamental powers? He couldn’t withstand a single blow at all.

One last thought flashed through his mind. These were combination seals, and there were shockingly many of them.

...

Nalan De was dead.

Everyone’s scalp went numb. So what if Grandmaster Hou was dead? He was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, after all, and the so-called grandmaster of raw stone was just an elevated status. However, Nalan De was a genuine Heavenly Venerate, and his strength was definitely far above everyone else’s. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to make everyone tremble with fear just by looking at him.

Such an elite could not even withstand a single blow from Ling Han?

Ling Han dispersed the Heavenly Venerable Seals and acted as if nothing had happened. Fourth Tier? This wasn’t the first time he had killed one of them.
