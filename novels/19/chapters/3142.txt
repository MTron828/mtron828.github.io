3143 A warship appears

However, the result was already out. The person who had killed the giant python was… Ling Han!

Who could have imagined this before? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Sima Rong was panting heavily, and the gaze he directed at Ling Han was filled with fury and confusion.

How could a Nine Meridians be so strong?

“Hahahaha.” Sun Jianfang laughed loudly. Ling Han had really done him proud this time, suppressing his peers and becoming number one.

“Humph, he merely took advantage of the situation,” Cao Cong said coldly, his face filled with displeasure.

Although he didn’t know how Sima Rong had broken through to Ten Meridians, nor did he know where he had learnt the four overlapping layers of power from, this was a person of Blue Feather City. Sima Rong had lost, so he was also embarrassed.

“Hehe, a Nine Meridians fighting against a Ten Meridians… If they win, what else is there to say?” Sun Jianfang slanted a sideways glance at Cao Cong. “Why don’t we wait until Ling Han advances into the Ten Meridians and have them fight again?”

These words rendered Cao Cong speechless. This was because once Ling Han reached the Ten Meridians, his power would definitely be able to suppress Sima Rong. At the same time, he would also be able to release his power which eliminated his greatest weakness.

Even if Sima Rong had four overlapping layers of power, it would probably be very difficult for him to win.

After all, all, under the crushing pressure of absolute power, even with four overlapping layers of power, he would still be defeated.

“A loss is a loss. Everyone, this Volcanic Fruit belongs to our Ancient Dao Sect. There’s no problem, right?” Sun Jianfang chuckled.

All the elders were speechless. They were all people who cared about their pride, so how could they take back their own words?

Moreover, the ones who truly made the decisions were the supreme king tiers of Twelve Meridians. They themselves didn’t need the Volcanic Fruit, so at most, they would only feel some discomfort and resentment, but wouldn’t feel the pain directly.

“Let’s go!” Ji Yuanlong waved his hand. He had the worst temper, and always liked to argue with others, but those with explosive tempers were also straightforward.

Everyone shook their heads, preparing to leave.

“Yi!”

They faltered for a moment before raising their heads to look at the sky.

A colossal shadow cast down, and a massive ship appeared in the skies. It was completely black in colour, and looked like a metallic monster.

The older generation had all seen planes with their own eyes, and the younger generation had also seen the information of flying vessels on the optical computer, and knew that there was something that could fly in the air without relying on wings.

However, aside from those with propellers, there were no other flying devices that could fly at such a slow speed. In fact, they could even hover in midair. Furthermore, no one had seen anything resembling propellers on this battle ship.

This battle ship wasn’t small. It was about 90 meters long, and even if placed in water, it was a large ship. As it floated in midair, it cast a huge shadow.

There was an emblem at the bow of the ship, and there was a five-clawed golden dragon drawn on it. It was vivid and lifelike, as if it could come to life.

Everyone was stunned. Ling Han was also stunned, because wasn’t this the warship of the Genesis World?

It could be driven by formations, and could be fast or slow, and could move or be still.

In this world, this was something that definitely should not have appeared.

Could it be that this had been dug out from an ancient site of the civilization of the last era?

Ling Han couldn’t confirm whether this was dug out from the ground or created after obtaining an ancient technique, but he definitely couldn’t underestimate it, because there were black cannon muzzles protruding from the body of the ship, giving him an extremely terrifying feeling of threat.

This battle ship slowly descended amidst everyone’s shock. Thankfully, this mountain peak was big enough. Otherwise, if it was any other mountain peak, it really might not be able to accommodate it.

After the warship landed, a floating ladder was thrown down from the bow of the ship, and people gradually walked down from it.

There were only ten people in total, and their leader was a woman who looked to be only in her mid-twenties. She was in the prime of her life, and her skin was so delicate that it looked like water could drip from it. Even if she was only covered with her hands, neck and face exposed, she still had a kind of captivating beauty.

She was dressed in a dark green tight-fitting outfit, completely outlining her voluptuous figure, especially her shapely bottom, over which the leather material was tightly stretched. The shape was completely obvious, as if she was a ripe peach.

She showed off her alluring grace, but the nine men behind her looked straight ahead, as if the person walking in front of them was not a woman at all.

“Sima Rong pays his respects to the Captain Lian!” Sima Rong rushed out, kneeling on one knee.

Hmm?

Seeing this scene, all the higher ups were stunned.

As a Ten Meridian king tier, he actually knelt down to pay his respects?

King tiers naturally had the pride of king tiers. How could they be so humble and subservient?

Cao Cong’s expression darkened. To a certain extent, a king tier of Ten Meridians could already represent a force. Now that Sima Rong had knelt down in front of others, it was equivalent to kneeling down together with the pride of Blue Feather City, so how could he not be angered?

“Sima Rong, what are you doing?” he asked harshly.

However, Sima Rong ignored him completely, and continued to kneel steadily.

The beauty in dark green attire glanced at Cao Cong, parted her bright red lips, and said, “To dare make a ruckus in front of me, what should the offender be punished with?”

“Execute the punishment,” the beauty in black said calmly.

“Yes.”

The man immediately walked out. Though he had been standing behind the beauty in black just now, like a bodyguard, the moment he stepped out, he was exuding a powerful aura, as if he had become a completely different person.

Cao Cong’s expression involuntarily changed slightly. This man was only in his thirties, but the feeling he gave off was filled with pressure.

Could it be that this person was also a top-notch king tier of Twelve Meridians?

The problem was that this man was only in his thirties, so how could he possibly be a Twelve Meridians?

“Old geezer, you’ve already lived for so long, yet you still don’t know how to control your mouth,” the man said coldly. With a bounce, he charged over.

Boom, he threw a punch, and instantly, a series of sonic booms rang out.

However, the speed at which the sonic boom spread couldn’t compare to his punch. He had just raised his hand, when his fist had already landed in front of Cao Cong.

Cao Cong humphed, and raised his right hand, blocking this punch.

Peng, the two of them clashed in close-quarter combat, but did not come into a solid contact. Instead, they stopped about three feet apart, as if there was an invisible wall between them that was blocking the both of them.

Power was released; this was a battle between king tiers.

Boom, the force reverberated, and the two of them took a few steps back at the same time.

This time, the expressions of Sun Jianfang and the others all became solemn. In this blow, though Cao Cong was not at a disadvantage, he similarly did not have the upper hand either.

Hiss, this man was actually a Twelve Meridians.

How was this possible?

Previously, the appearance of Sima Rong, a Ten Meridians, was already enough to stun everyone to the point of disbelief. Now, another thirty-year-old Twelve Meridians elite had appeared?

Heavens, what was wrong with this world?

“Desolate natives are indeed weak!” The man laughed loudly, and attacked again. This time, he was not just throwing a casual punch. Instead, multiple layers of light condensed on his fist.
