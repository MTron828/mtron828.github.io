Chapter 3394: The Nature of a Fierce Overlord

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Seventh Prince pondered for a moment, and said, “If Imperial Father doesn’t come out of seclusion in time, we will definitely lose this battle. However, we absolutely cannot fight to the death. If that’s the case, the human race will really perish. Therefore, we need to preserve our living power.” Ling Han was astonished. ‘What do you mean by that?’

“When the war begins, you will leave with me. I have already made arrangements. You can rise up in this chaotic world,” the Seventh Prince said.

‘You mean to become a deserter?’

Ling Han’s eyes widened slightly, and he looked at the Seventh Imperial Prince without saying a word.

The Seventh Prince smiled slightly. “Those who achieve great things don’t care about trifles. I don’t want to see the lives of people plunged into misery and suffering, but if it’s unavoidable, we definitely can’t rush forward when we know that we’ll die.”

Ling Han instantly understood.

This Seventh Prince was ambitious and capable, but he was not a benevolent emperor, but an ambitious and ruthless overlord.

He only cared about his own ambitions and aspirations. As for how many sacrifices he would have to make on this path, he did not care at all.

To work or cooperate with such a person, one really had to be careful. Who knew if they would suddenly be sold?

In the Seventh Prince’s eyes, people were ranked according to their values. If you had no value, you would be sacrificed, or sacrificed for greater value.

In that instant, Ling Han decided to keep his distance from the Seventh Imperial Prince. Otherwise, he might really be tricked one day.

“I believe… the situation will not deteriorate to such an extent,” he said.

“Optimism is a good thing, but blind optimism may get you killed.” The Seventh Imperial Prince patted Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “Think about it carefully. I still look forward to working with you and conspiring for a great cause.”

Ling Han smiled. He didn’t want to shed all pretense of cordiality with the Seventh Imperial Prince, but it was absolutely impossible for them to have a deeper level of cooperation.

He felt that the Seventh Prince was more and more terrifying. If he got too close, he might be dragged down with him.

Their paths were different, and they could not not work together.

“I’ll go back first. Think about it carefully.” The Seventh Prince turned around and left.

Telling Ling Han to think about it twice in a row meant that he still thought very highly of Ling Han. Unfortunately, Ling Han had already seen through his ambitious and ruthless nature.

Ling Han smiled, and saw the Seventh Imperial Prince leave.

He was now under house arrest. No one could come to see him at all. Even his optical computer could not connect to the Internet. It could be said that he had completely lost contact with the outside world. Only mighty figures like the Seventh Prince could enter this place.

“If I really wanted to charge out, would anyone be able to stop me?” Ling Han shook his head.

Time passed day by day, and the atmosphere in the Imperial Capital became more and more tense.

The deadline given by the Demon Race was getting closer and closer, but those mighty figures had yet to make a final decision. The Holy Emperor had been in seclusion the entire time. If the Demon Race army pressed down on the border, how could they withstand it?

The timid people were already prepared to move their entire family, but they didn’t know where to move to. Perhaps if they fled recklessly, they might bump into the Demon Race.

Everyone was in a state of panic. If the Holy Emperor did not appear, everyone would feel that they had lost their backbone and no confidence.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was calm and collected. He cultivated every day, studying formations and alchemy, and his days were extremely fulfilling.

Just like that, eight days passed.

The big shots held another meeting. This time, they did not call Ling Han over. It was said that only the few elder princes insisted on fighting, while the military and Council Chairman did their best to oppose it.

On the morning of the second day, a decision was finally made.

Fight!

Ling Han did not know how the Four Great Generals and Council Chairman had been convinced. Perhaps those few princes had all used force, and at least a few of them should have reached the Enlightenment Tier. It was naturally not difficult to “convince” the Four Great Generals and the others.

Since they had decided to start a war, they would mobilize all of their forces to resist the invasion of the Demon Race.

Ling Han was also notified that he was to join the army and take the lead.

Regarding this, Ling Han did not mind. Although he admitted that he had not done anything wrong, he was still the fuse of this war after all. It was not too much to be on the frontlines.

Instead, he was a little excited. He wanted to experience the power of the Demon Race.

The second-generation young masters of the Imperial Capital had also been mobilized. Most of them were students of the Imperial Capital Academy, and there were also those who had long since graduated. The Demon Race was too powerful, requiring the battle prowess of Extreme Bone Tier to resist, and they were the backbone of the forces.

Most people were pessimistic, but they also held onto a sliver of hope. That was that their Holy Emperor would come out of seclusion and turn the situation around single-handedly. Otherwise… this would really be courting death. So what if they could withstand the Demon Race for ten days or a month?

In the end, the sky would still collapse.

These noble soldiers gathered in the square. The Four Great Generals would mobilize them and then set off to the front lines.

When Ling Han arrived, he immediately received many hateful gazes.

In the eyes of most people, it was entirely Ling Han’s fault that they were standing here, and once they entered the battlefield, it was very likely that more than half of them would not return.

Who wanted to die? Especially these second-generation young masters. They lived a carefree life in the capital. War was originally an incomparably distant matter to them, but now that they had to face it all of a sudden, they were at a loss.

Ling Han didn’t say anything. Even if he told these people, even if it wasn’t for his own reasons, the Demon Race would still launch an invasion. It was just that the time might be a few days later.

At ten o’clock in the morning, everyone arrived. Those who were late would be sentenced to death. This was war, and there were no exceptions. No one could act like a big shot.

The Four Great Generals began to babble and say words to motivate and stir up their fighting spirits. On the battlefield, morale was very important.

If their morale was low, they might only be able to exert 30% of their battle prowess. However, if their morale was high, they might be able to exert more than their standard.

“Alright, set out!”

After the Four Great Generals explained everything, Yang Bai stood up and waved his hand. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as everyone was about to set off, they suddenly saw a black shadow cast down from the sky.

“What’s that?” Someone had sharp eyes.

“A warship?”

“Why is our warship there?”

Everyone was curious. This was because they would also mobilize all the warships in this battle and set off in unison. It was really too unexpected for a warship to appear at that location.

“It’s the Demon Race’s warship!” When the black shadow got closer, everyone saw it clearly and exclaimed.

Someone from the Demon Race came?

Why had they chosen to come at this time?

If they did not hand over Ling Han today, then the next step would be war.

Could it be that the Demon Race was full of confidence and believed that the human race would definitely lower their heads, so they sent out warships to directly bring Ling Han back?

How arrogant.

The warship was huge, but its speed was not slow. Soon, it arrived above the square, casting a huge shadow.

Hiss, this warship was about 600 metres long and 240 metres wide. It could be said to be a colossus. Such a huge entity could not even land on the plaza. It could only hover.

Xiu, a giant eagle flew out from the warship and descended rapidly..
