“The Meridian Guiding Pill,” Ling Han said calmly.

“Are you serious?” The man was wearing a goat mask, and his face could not be seen clearly. However, one could tell from his physique that he was a slender man.

His current expression was not visible, but judging from his tone, it should be filled with surprise.

Meridian Guiding Pills could be said to be extremely popular. It was said that some forces did not even use jade seeds when conducting transactions, but instead used Meridian Guiding Pills.

Was there a need to sell it on the black market?

The man was skeptical. Everyone knew that there were many fake goods on the black market. How could he guarantee that this was real?

“Let me see,” he said.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Sure.”

The goat-masked man picked up the bottle, and pulled out the cork. After smelling it, he couldn’t help but reveal an excited expression.

It seemed to be the real deal!

He immediately looked left and right as if he was a thief.

To obtain the Meridian Guiding Fruit in the Ancient Dao Sect? It was difficult.

Even a prodigy like Li Changdan could only get one Meridian Guiding Fruit every two years. It was even more difficult for others. Many people had not even gotten a single Meridian Guiding Fruit since they joined the sect.

As for the Meridian Guiding Pill, it was even rarer because… no one knew how to refine pills.

It wasn’t that no one had tried it before, but being tempered by the force of heaven and earth, the ingredients would only turn into charcoal.

Alchemy required natural talent.

The goat-masked man did have some status. When he had been adventuring outside, he had once bought a Meridian Guiding Pill at a high price. He had smelled and consumed it before.

Therefore, he was certain that the smell was genuine.

Of course, it was also possible that Ling Han had used a bottle that had once contained the Meridian Guiding Pill to deceive him. He did not immediately say that he wanted to buy it, but he was also afraid that it would be discovered by others. Thus, he acted like he was a thief.

He poured out the pill. There was only a green alchemical pill inside, emitting a faintly bittersweet smell.

It was real. It was definitely real.

The goat-masked man was now certain that this was the real deal.

“How much?” he asked, his voice trembling slightly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “150 jade seeds.”

He had originally wanted to price it at 200 jade seeds, but after thinking about it, the people here probably didn’t have such assets, so he decided to lower the price slightly. In any case, he already made a huge profit of 150 jade seeds.

Who asked him to be the Alchemy Emperor? It was like that in the Genesis World, and it was the same here.

“I’ll buy it!” The goat-masked man was overjoyed when he heard this. The Meridian Guiding Pill he had bought previously had cost him more than 200 jade seeds, and it had drained him of all his assets. And this was including the great harvest he had obtained from the ancient sites, added with an ancient artifact that he had excavated to trade for it.

150 jade seeds. He had really made a killing.

“You can only consume it yourself. If you sell it to someone else, then you don’t have to buy medicine from me in the future,” Ling Han said calmly. He was not a fool that he would allow others to resell pills and earn an exorbitant profit.

The goat-masked man was stunned. “Brother, you know how to refine pills?”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “My name is Han Lin. In the future… on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of every month, I might come here. If you want to buy alchemical pills, you can come and take a look.”

“Alright, alright, alright.” The goat-masked man hurriedly nodded. He leaned over, and whispered, “My name is Nie Yang. If you encounter any trouble in the sect in the future, feel free to look for me.”

He wanted to befriend Ling Han. Formation alchemists were extremely rare. Otherwise, why would he announce his real name?

However, he knew that what Ling Han had revealed was definitely a fake name. If the Ancient Dao Sect had produced a formation alchemist named Han Lin, how could he not have heard of him?

“Alright.” Ling Han nodded. He accepted Nie Yang’s jade seeds.

Nie Yang was just about to leave when he discovered that Ling Han had taken out another bottle and placed it on the ground.

Curious, he asked, “Brother Han, what alchemical pill is this?”

“The Meridian Guiding Pill,” Ling Han said calmly.

Pu!

Nie Yang spluttered. What? Another Meridian Guiding Pill?

No one disliked having too many Meridian Guiding Pills, and it was the same for the king tiers of Eleven Meridians. This was because the more meridians that were opened, the more difficult it would be to sense new meridians.

To say nothing of one Meridian Guiding Pill, even 10 or 20 wouldn’t be too much.

Nie Yang had only achieved Seven Meridians, and he was still five meridians away from reaching Twelve Meridians. Even if his luck exploded, he would still need five Meridian Guiding Pills to reach his peak. Therefore, his eyes immediately turned red with excitement.

“I’ll buy it!” he said resolutely, not bothering to distinguish the authenticity of the alchemical pill.

However, Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Each person is limited to buying one.”

Nie Yang was furious. How could there be such a rule?

It wasn’t easy for him to get such an opportunity. The people around him had not noticed them, but Ling Han had actually limited that each person was only allowed to buy one?

“I’ll buy two!” he pleaded.

Ling Han remained unmoved. Since he was the Alchemy Emperor, he naturally had his own rules.

Nie Yang thought for a moment, and decided to find someone to help him buy this pill.

He really did it. He walked to the side and said to someone, “Brother, I’ll give you 160 jade seeds. Go there and buy that bottle. It’s only 150 jade seeds. The extra 10 jade seeds will be your commission. How about that?”

10 jade seeds was already a huge sum of money, so that person was naturally moved. He turned to look at him.

Could this be a conspiracy?

“That person has some old grudges with me. I’m afraid that he’ll recognize my voice, so I’ll have to trouble you,” Nie Yang said. He really lied very easily.

“Alright.” That person agreed. In any case, it was no loss to him.

That person went over, and said, “150 jade seeds?”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded.

“I’ll buy it,” the man said, and looked at Nie Yang.

Nie Yang hurriedly took out a bag and handed it over. His heart was filled with apprehension, afraid that Ling Han would refuse.

However, Ling Han accepted the bag. He didn’t mind Nie Yang’s petty tricks, but he threw the pill bottle to the person who was purchasing it for him. He was the one who had set the rule, so it naturally couldn’t be broken.

“You can only consume it yourself. You can’t sell it to others,” he said, emphasizing this rule.

That person took the pill bottle, and originally wanted to give it to Nie Yang, but out of caution, he asked, “What pill is this?”

“The Meridian Guiding Pill,” Ling Han said casually. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At the side, Nie Yang almost stomped his feet in fury. He really wanted to shut Ling Han up.

“What?!” That person was shocked, and he hurriedly opened the bottle to take a sniff. He immediately became excited. This really was a Meridian Guiding Pill!

“Give it to me!” Nie Yang hurriedly stretched out his hand.

That person turned his body to the side and dodged him.

“Aren’t you a man of your word?” Nie Yang said balefully.

“This is the Meridian Guiding Pill. You deceived me first, and you still want me to keep my word?” That person sneered, and threw out a bag. “Here, I’ll return your jade seeds!”

As long as one had not reached 12 Meridians, who did not need the Meridian Guiding Pill?

Wanting him to give up on this with just 10 jade seeds? What a joke.

“This is not our agreement!” Nie Yang said coldly. “Hand over the item, or I won’t be polite.”

This was the Meridian Guiding Pill. How could he give up!
