Chapter 1174:

Being Nosy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Huh? Why did Sister Shui suddenly disappear last night?” Hu Feiyun asked with a strange expression the next morning.

Shui Yanyu was eating at that moment, and she instantly started to cough upon hearing this. She then glared at Ling Han with fury.

It was all his fault. He had called her over in the middle of the night to do those shameful things.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Children shouldn’t ask too many questions. Concentrate on eating your breakfast!”

Hu Feiyun puffed her cheeks. Why did they all treat her like a child? Big Sister did so, and Ling Han was also doing so right now. This made her very angry!

After breakfast, they continued on their way.

This place didn’t only contain eerie things like the Misty Soul Capturing Flower and Saintly Scarabs, but also contained all kinds of Godly medicine and treasures. If this weren’t the case, the Misty Soul Capturing Flower wouldn’t have attracted so many people in the first place.

The reason it had attracted so many people was because everyone thought it was a kind of Godly medicine.

They discovered several Godly medicines as they walked, yet it was a pity that they had come too late and the Godly medicines had already been plucked.

Some people had been rough, and they even destroyed the roots of the Godly medicines when they plucked them away. However, some people had been relatively careful, and they took care to leave the roots intact when they plucked the Godly medicines. This way, they could return to pluck the Godly medicines again after one century, two centuries, or even more centuries.

Ling Han didn’t beat around the bush, and he dug up all the roots that he saw and tossed them into the Black Tower. The effects of these Godly medicines would be maximized if they were placed in the Black Tower.

The smile on Ling Han’s face grew wider and wider. His harvest was truly bountiful. If he could reap such a yield every day, this trip would already be worth it.

However, his luck was fluctuating—on some days he would come across seven or eight Godly medicines, while on other days he would come across absolutely nothing.

Seven days passed by in the blink of an eye.

Ding, ding, ding, ding!

The sound of clashing weapons traveled over from the distance. In fact, they could even see bursts of divine light soaring into the sky. It was clear that an intense battle was raging in the distance.

Hu Feiyun’s interest was piqued, and she said, “Let’s check it out!”

Shui Yanyu, who wasn’t as curious as Hu Feiyun, said, “It’s best that we keep our noses out of other people’s matters.”

However, Hu Feiyun was already running toward the location of the battle, an excited expression on her face.

They hadn’t experienced any battles during the past seven days, and thus the Ninth King—who was extremely lively—was already barely able to contain herself.

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu exchanged a glance. They had no choice but to run after Hu Feiyun.

However, they weren’t afraid, either, as Sun Moon Tier elites weren’t able to enter this Mystery Realm. Ling Han was almost invincible, so at least they didn’t need to worry about their safety.

There was a field of scattered rocks before them, and after passing through it, the two battling parties appeared in their vision.

One group had seven people, and the other group was even larger, with 25 people. The larger group had formed an encirclement and trapped the group of seven inside.

“Hand the Nine Layer Divine Lotus over, and we can spare your lives!” a member of the encircling group said.

“Bullsh*t!” There was a seductive red-haired beauty among the trapped group of seven, and she was dressed in a particularly revealing manner. She was wearing a shoulderless upper armor that left her jade-like arms revealed, and in fact, even a portion of her voluptuous breasts could still be seen.

Her lower armor only reached halfway down her thighs as well, and her long and slender legs were clear for all to see.

However, her skin wasn’t white, but rather a tanned wheat color. An astonishing vitality radiated from her body, and she seemed much like a female leopard.

She humphed, and continued, “You guys haven’t attempted to kill us only because you’re afraid that we’ll destroy the Nine Layer Divine Lotus! However, you’ll definitely kill us once we hand it over.”

“Hahahaha!” The encircling group roared with laughter.

“There’s no need to worry, Leader Meng. The others will die, but you definitely won’t!”

Another person chuckled lewdly, and said, “I’ve heard about Leader Meng’s beauty for a long time. Won’t it be a massive waste if we can’t taste Leader Meng’s body?”

“Hehehe!”

“Hahaha!”

The members of the encircling group all laughed wantonly. This Mystery Realm was huge, so it was almost impossible for others to discover their depraved acts—even if someone did, they could simply kill them along with the victims.

“How detestable!” Hu Feiyun couldn’t watch on, and she drew her sword as she charged out, shouting, “Evil villains, eat my sword!”

The encircling group faltered slightly upon seeing her charge out by herself. After a moment, however, they all broke into laughter. She was just a young lady, so wasn’t she charging into a lion’s den?

“It’s another beautiful woman!”

“Just what we needed! There’s only one Leader Meng, so how long would we have needed to line up for? Even if three of us do her at the same time, we’ll still need to wait for seven rounds. Now that there’s another beautiful woman, we’ll only need to wait for three rounds!”

“Huh? Look over there, Boss, there’s another stunning beauty!”

Their gazes turned to Shui Yanyu, and they couldn’t help but drool in excitement. This woman was even more beautiful than the other two. Moreover, her seductive nature was one that could suck one’s soul. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

They would be willing to sacrifice 100 years of their life just to do this stunning beauty once!

“Ao!” They all howled in lustful excitement.

“Heh, you guys are dreaming!” Ling Han arrived before them in a flash, and calmly said, “I can spare your lives if you guys f*ck off by yourselves.”

Ling Han wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, and he didn’t know what had happened between these two groups of people, either. Thus, he didn’t want to massacre them.

A sturdy man who was around 30 years old walked over, and said, “Brat, you’re quite arrogant, aren’t you?”

His clothes were unbuttoned, revealing his large and round belly. His face was full of pudgy flesh, and he was currently holding a large saber. Strong killing intent radiated from his body.

“Thanks for your help, handsome guy. However, these people aren’t easy to deal with. It’s best that you take this chance to escape!” the red-haired beauty shouted.

“You’ve already stuck your nose into this matter, so how can you leave now?” a member of the encircling group said with a sneer.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “You’re nothing but a bunch of weaklings. What are you acting so smug for?”

“You’re seeking death!” A cold glint flashed across the big-bellied man’s eyes, and he seized the opportunity while Ling Han was talking to leap over and slash at him.

He used his full strength, and divine light radiated from his saber as divine patterns intertwined in the surrounding air. A frosty aura surged toward Ling Han.

Pu!

There was a flash, and the Divine Demon Sword had already appeared and slashed outward, shattering the saber into pieces. The Divine Demon Sword didn’t stop, instead continuing on its trajectory and slashing the big-bellied man into two.

Intestines burst into the air as blood sprayed everywhere.

Gasp!

Everyone was stunned. They were petrified by the power of his sword.

It was far too terrifying. How could the might of his sword be so domineering?

Weng!

The Divine Demon Sword hovered beside Ling Han, not a drop of blood on its blade. However, a frightening murderous aura radiated from its body.

Following the elevation of its level, the might that radiated from this Divine Sword was also becoming increasingly devastating. One had to realize that Devouring Metal could evolve to become Divine Metal. Even if it hadn’t reached that level yet, it was still many times more powerful than ordinary Godly metal.

The encircling group didn’t dare to underestimate Ling Han any longer. One of them solemnly asked, “Sir, you are?”

The members of this group all robbed others for a living, and they had spent some money as well as robbed some others to obtain the jade pendants needed for entering this Mystery Realm. They had obtained enough jade pendants for 25 members to enter.

None of them could be considered a prodigy, yet after countless years of cultivation, all of them had reached the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier.

In their minds, they would be invincible as long as they worked together.

However, Ling Han had killed one of them with a single stroke of his sword. This put them on edge, and they finally realized that such kinds of powerful prodigies genuinely existed in the world. The profound might of Ling Han’s battle prowess was far beyond their imagination.
