2946 Arrival of the Mighty Figures

Fortunately, Yue Borong was a Sixth Tier elite.

Thank you readers!

Even though his cultivation level was suppressed, his body had been tempered by five different types of fundamental power before. This was something that wouldn’t become weaker. Thus, he could easily withstand Ling Han’s attacks. It was just that he would feel a little uncomfortable.

Sixth Tier elites were far more powerful than Fifth Tier elites. Even though Yue Borong was at a huge disadvantage, he still had a chance to turn the tables on Ling Han.

If he could exhaust Ling Han’s Heavenly Venerable Seals, and if he still had some remaining, he could rely on them to overcome the gap in power between them. At that time, he could perhaps achieve victory.

Of course, he definitely couldn’t imagine that Ling Han possessed a whopping 300 or so Heavenly Venerable Seals. Thus, trying to exhaust his Heavenly Venerable Seals? Could he truly withstand Ling Han’s relentless attacks for so long?

Zhou Heng watched on, not showing any signs of wanting to interfere.

Since he didn’t interfere, Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Feng Wuding naturally couldn’t interfere, either. Otherwise, wouldn’t they be disrespecting a Sixth Tier elite?

Only when Yue Borong became bruised and battered did Zhou Heng finally say, “Ling Han, that’s enough. This is Lord Yue Borong, your senior!”

Ling Han stepped back, and said, “Understood, Senior Zhou.”

Everyone was rendered speechless. They were clearly doing this on purpose. Zhou Heng could have stopped Ling Han a long time ago, yet he insisted on waiting until Yue Borong was beaten to a pulp to stop him. His intention was as clear as day.

Yue Borong was extremely disheveled as he huffed and puffed. He was huffing and puffing in pure rage.

He glared at Ling Han, and it was as if flames were about to burst from his eyes.

This was utter humiliation! He was a mighty Sixth Tier elite, yet he had been viciously pummeled before so many people! How could he endure this?

However, what could he do?

Fight again? But he couldn’t defeat Ling Han! Ling Han was clearly at the Fourth Tier, yet he still couldn’t rival him.

Thus, he could only endure this.

Ling Han looked at Yue Borong, and said, “I’m truly sorry for offending you, Senior Yue.”

He even clasped his hands in apology.

Yue Borong’s expression was extremely dark. He had arrived with arrogance, yet he was now being forced to swallow his anger. This made him lose all his face. He took a deep breath. He definitely couldn’t allow himself to be manipulated by Zhou Heng and Ling Han. Right now, the most important thing was to indict Ling Han.

“Enough with the nonsense. I want to capture Ling Han, so what do you say?” he said as he looked squarely at Zhou Heng.

“I already said. Ling Han explained his situation to Senior Brother Lin, Junior Brother Chu, and me a long time ago. All three of us examined his mind, and we concluded that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it,” Zhou Heng replied calmly. However, his voice was incredibly firm.

Three Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates had reached a consensus on this, so who could change their minds?

“Zhou Heng, are you hellbent on shielding this traitor?” Yue Borong asked in a baleful voice.

“The investigation hasn’t finished yet, so don’t speak in such a categorical manner,” Zhou Heng said. He appeared especially calm and composed, and he continued, “In any case, Ling Han isn’t a traitor. He wasn’t in the past, he isn’t in the present, and he won’t be in the future.”

“Heh, Brother Zhou, are your words not a little too exaggerated?” someone said with a chuckle. They looked over, only to see a man walking over. No one saw where he came from, and it was as if he had always been here.

Zhou Heng involuntarily became tense, and he said, “Ten Thousand Shadows!”

The Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Venerate, a Sixth Tier!

“I’m also of the opinion that things and people can change,” another voice said. This was a white-haired old man. His body was covered in crimson scales, and there was also a three-meter-long tail protruding from his back.

“Golden Silk Moth!”

Zhou Heng’s expression became even more solemn.

The Golden Silk Moth Heavenly Venerate was also a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. It was said that his true body was that of a golden silk moth, and after becoming a Heavenly Venerate, he started to undergo a series of transformations. He became a snake, then a wolf, then a tiger, then an elephant, then a phoenix, and then a dragon.

If he transformed again, he would advance to the Seventh Tier and become the most powerful in the world.

This was a supremely powerful opponent, and even Zhou Heng didn’t dare to say that he could defeat him with confidence. After all, the Golden Silk Moth Heavenly Venerate was also a profoundly talented person who was only a small step away from advancing to the Seventh Tier.

The reason the Golden Silk Moth Heavenly Venerate appeared so old was because his golden silk moth cultivation method could truly cause him to die. However, when his corpse became a cocoon, what would emerge from it would be his body which had undergone seven transformations.

Thus, the older he looked, the more terrifying he would be.

“I also agree that we should capture him and carefully search his soul!” the Golden Silk Moth Heavenly Venerate said.

Zhou Heng suppressed his anger, and said, “The mind is extremely important, yet it’s also incredibly fragile. Searching Ling Han’s soul will inevitably damage his mind and affect his future growth.”

“So what? Is this not what we should do to weed out the spies of Hysteria?” Yue Borong asked.

‘Weed out you mom!’

Ling Han wanted to curse at him, yet he could only suppress his urge after seeing the signal in Zhou Heng’s eyes. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Since we’re unable to reach a consensus, we can only invite the Seventh Tier elites over,” Zhou Heng said, unleashing his trump card.

Not every Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate had the support of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. At the very least, Yue Borong, the Golden Silk Moth Heavenly Venerate, and the Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Venerate didn’t.

Zhou Heng released a special signal.

In just an instant, a terrifying aura descended from the sky.

A Seventh Tier elite had arrived.

This was naturally Lin Luo, and it was only one of his doppelgangers that had arrived. However, being a mighty Seventh Tier elite, even his doppelganger was powerful enough to suppress most Sixth Tier elites.

If Lin Luo’s true self arrived, even the unique environment here wouldn’t be able to suppress his cultivation. Seventh Tier elites had already jumped out from this world and truly achieved transcendence. Thus, they would be able to wield their full power no matter where they were, even in transcendent dimensions.

However, this was only a doppelganger, so it naturally couldn’t be so powerful. Its cultivation level was also suppressed to the Fifth Tier.

Everyone bowed, and said, “Our respects to Lord Lin!”

Even Zhou Heng, the Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Venerate, and the others bowed in respect.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates represented heaven and earth, represented true meaning, and represented all matter.

Lin Luo nodded in acknowledgment. However, he faltered just as he was just about to speak.

Weng!

More terrifying auras descended.

One, two, three…

They were all the doppelgangers of Seventh Tier elites.

Xin Fu, Chong Yan, and Shatter Mountains.

“Brother Lin, it’s better to capture him,” Xin Fu said.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han cursed in his mind.

He then looked at Xin Qihu. It was possible that Xin Fu had been called over by him.

Lin Luo glanced at him, and said, “I believe there’s a huge chance that Ling Han will be the key to comprehensively defeating Hysteria in the future. As such, we should put our absolute trust in him and help him reach the Seventh Tier as soon as possible.”

“Reach the Seventh Tier and help Hysteria attack us?” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said with a sneer. He had come from a different generation and different realm than Lin Luo, so he didn’t show an iota of respect toward him.

“There’s no need to say anything else. We already have a candidate who can defeat Hysteria, and that person is Feng Wuding!” he loudly proclaimed. It was as if he were rectifying Feng Wuding’s name.

It didn’t matter that he had been defeated by Ling Han. After all, Ling Han was Hysteria’s subordinate.

Thinking about this carefully, however, it was quite a hilarious proposition.

If Ling Han were genuinely Hysteria’s subordinate, then how could Feng Wuding defeat Hysteria if he couldn’t even defeat one of its subordinates?

Oh, he couldn’t even deal with an underling, yet he could kill the more powerful boss?

What an absolute joke!

“I say that we should kill him!” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan said in a baleful voice.
