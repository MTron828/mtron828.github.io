3142 Killing the giant python

Sun Jianfang remained calm and collected, and only revealed a faint smile. “That may not be the case. Everyone, why don’t you quietly take a closer look?”

Peng!

Ling Han unleashed his power, and his figure was extraordinarily fast.

“Yi, this kind of explosive power really does seem a bit like Ten Meridians.” Meng Ruining was the first to exclaim in surprise.

“Not necessarily. Some people are born with natural speed, so it wouldn’t be strange for the speed of a Nine Meridians to be comparable to Ten Meridians.”

“Hehe, if the Ancient Dao Sect could produce a young Ten Meridians king tier, that would really be too incredible.”

Everyone couldn’t believe it. It was already a miracle for such a young Ten Meridians king tier to appear once, so how could there possibly be as many as two?

“Just wait and see!”

Ling Han had already charged over. His iron fists clenched, and he used the Four Directional Fists. He delivered a heavy strike at the giant python.

Peng!

The giant python was currently engaged in a fierce battle with Sima Rong, so how could it bother about Ling Han? Instantly, it was hit head-on. Under the massive impact, it couldn’t help but be sent flying six meters away, flattening the rocks that protruded from the ground.

However, it was not made of copper and iron, after all. This friction caused it to shed a great many scales, and leave behind a considerable amount of blood.

Hiss, everyone inhaled sharply. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This was definitely power of a Ten Meridians. It had surpassed 30,000 kilograms, and had actually reached 50,000 kilograms.

“No, his power only exploded when his fist landed on the snake’s body.” Cao Cong immediately saw through the truth of the matter.

“In other words, he didn’t release his power.”

“By unleashing one’s power, he can hit his opponent faster and also effectively protect himself, avoiding the weakness of our physique, but he didn’t use it.”

“There can only be one reason for that—”

“He’s still a Nine Meridians!”

Everyone exclaimed in shock. This Nine Meridians could possess the power of a Ten Meridians, and it was a peak stage Ten Meridians at that. How could they believe this?

“The two are freaks!”

“Someone who has broken through to Ten Meridians before thirty years old, and has even cultivated four overlapping layers of power.”

“One of them looks to be only 20 years old. He’s clearly a Nine Meridians elite, yet he possesses the peak stage power of Ten Meridians.”

“Is this still the world of cultivation that we know?”

Sima Rong also raised a corner of his eyes. He was already 100% sure that he could kill the giant python, but Ling Han’s sudden intrusion caused him slight surprise.

What powerful strength.

When had a Nine Meridians become so awesome?

However, he wanted to compete with him with just that?

Without becoming a Ten Meridians, he ultimately couldn’t be called a king tier.

“You want to contend with me?” Sima Rong charged over. His target wasn’t the giant python, but Ling Han!

He had a strong confidence that he would be able to easily suppress his opponents even if it was a battle of two against one.

“Isn’t this the competition that we had previously agreed on?” Ling Han asked calmly. They were competing to see who would be able to kill the giant python first, so why was it that when it came to Sima Rong, for him to make a move was considered a fault?

“Humph, how could this hand be stretched randomly?” Sima Rong no longer attacked the giant python first, and merely attacked Ling Han repeatedly.

“So what?” Ling Han stepped forward without fear.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow. Ling Han was using the Four Directional Fists, while Sima Rong was still using that Break Dragon Flash, overlapping four layers of power, each layer reaching strength as high as 50,000kg.

Ling Han’s figure swayed, and he retreated nine steps consecutively. Then, he retreated another seven steps, and then five steps again, and only then did he manage to stabilize himself. Sima Rong, on the other hand, did not retreat in the slightest.

It could not be helped. Sima Rong was a Ten Meridians, and when he released his power, Ling Han’s punch had not landed on his body at all. Naturally, it could not possibly have any effect on him.

And under the stacked attacks of four overlapping layers of power, Ling Han retreated repeatedly, retreating three consecutive times before he managed to steady his footing.

“This brat… his conventional power is actually superior to Sima Rong!”

“That’s right. Otherwise, he should have retreated four times, and not three times.”

“Hiss, 50,000 kilograms of strength is actually not his limit!”

Everyone was stunned speechless. In this kind of exchange, though Ling Han was at a disadvantage, in terms of true power, Ling Han was slightly superior.

How could this be believed?

A Nine Meridians was actually even more powerful than a Ten Meridians!

Was this still a world that they knew?

Sima Rong’s eyes also narrowed. This was the first time that he felt threatened. A mere Nine Meridians had actually surpassed him in terms of raw power. If it was not for the fact that he could release his power, and if it was not for the fact that he still had four overlapping layers of power, wouldn’t he be at a disadvantage?

“If you don’t become a Ten Meridians elite, you’re still an ant in the end!” he said coldly. ‘So what if you’re freakish? In the end, you’re only a Nine Meridians elite. It’s impossible for you to win against him.’

And as long as he ingested that Volcanic Fruit, he would be able to charge up to Eleven Meridians. At that time, he would then kill Ling Han. Even if Sun Jianfang interfered, so what? Even if he couldn’t fight him to a tie, he would at least be able to retreat unscathed.

“Is that so?” Ling Han asked calmly. His fists moved, and every move he made was a head-on clash with Sima Rong.

However, this wasn’t just a battle between the two of them. The giant python also approached and launched an attack. In its eyes, Sima Rong and Ling Han were both enemies, so it naturally treated them the same. With a sweep of its tail, the two of them were attacked at the same time.

This had become a battle royale between three sides. Ling Han, Sima Rong, and the giant python had to fight two other opponents at the same time. This was not only dangerous, but also more exhausting.

“How long can you last?” Sima Rong sneered. He couldn’t release his power, so Ling Han could only take each blow head-on. The weakness of his physique would undoubtedly be exposed, and he definitely wouldn’t be able to last more than a few moves.

Ling Han ignored him. Aside from Brother Monkey, no one knew just how astonishing his vitality was. Though his whole body had gone numb from the attacks of Sima Rong and the giant python, he would recover in an instant.

Even if a wound was really left behind, the bleeding would very quickly stop and scab over.

This was a unique trait that he had obtained from the Divine Stone. He had once been the strongest Heavenly Venerate, so how could it possibly have no benefit at all?

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Ling Han was especially durable. Several hundred moves had already passed, and he could still keep up a defensive and an offensive. He wasn’t the first to collapse.

On the other hand, Sima Rong and the giant python encountered the biggest problem.

Their power was close to exhaustion.

It couldn’t be helped. Their power was stored in their meridians, and only when the sun first rose would they be able to sense the mystical power of heaven and earth. When they cultivated, they would either replenish their energy, or use the Spirit Gathering Formation to extract the power of the jade seeds.

But now, both of them could not do that.

This power could only be unleashed and there was no replenishment, so naturally, the more they fought, the less it would become. In the end, they would be exhausted.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was a fresh force, and his meridians had been opened wide enough, so he could store even more power than a Ten Meridians. Then, he would definitely be able to last longer than Sima Rong and the giant python.

Sima Rong could not believe it. He would actually be defeated in this manner?

He couldn’t accept this. A king tier of Ten Meridians was actually going to lose to a Nine Meridians. No matter what the reason was, this was a great humiliation, and he would be laughed at to death.

“Scram!” Ling Han threw a heavy punch. The advantage of the Four Directional Fists was that they could allow power to be steadily unleashed without any fluctuations in force.

Peng!

Sima Rong was instantly sent flying. After using all his power, he was actually not much stronger than an ordinary person.

Meanwhile, Ling Han charged toward the giant python. Peng, peng, peng! He threw nineteen consecutive punches. Although these weren’t overlapping layers of power, the speed of his punches was fast enough. Each punch landed on about the same spot, and the power of his punches wasn’t much weaker than that.

After nineteen punches, the giant python’s head was forcefully blown apart by Ling Han.
