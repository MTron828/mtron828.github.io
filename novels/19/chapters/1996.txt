Chapter 1997: Ji Wuming charges over

“Ugly, you’re about to be chased to death already, so what are you grinning at?” Hu Niu was never reserved with her words.

Yi broke into laughter. “I can’t kill it, but it can’t cause any harm to me, either.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Why don’t we work together?”

“Sure!”

At first, Ling Han had thought someone as proud as Yi would not agree to working together, but he had not expected that the latter would actually agree so decisively. This was slightly beyond his expectations.

But he was not the kind to dillydally, either. Immediately, he charged towards the skeletal fish with a battle cry.

“Niu comes too!” Niu released a deep roar, and similarly charged over.

The Empress was much prouder. Though she also charged out, she was incredibly aloof, and only released a harsh attack.

As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, she could only watch the excitement from the sidelines. The gap in strength between a fourth severance emperor tier and a monarch tier would show the most at this kind of time. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Peng!

Ling Han rushed forwards, and that skeletal fish immediately swept its tail towards him. Peng, he was sent flying backwards, completely incapable of mounting the slightest resistance.

Realization dawned on him. No wonder Yi was being chased all over this place. The battle prowess of this skeletal fish was indeed astonishing.

However, Ling Han’s physique was too tough. Only Heaven Soul Tier elites should be able to cause real damage to him within the Dividing Soul Tier. As for Earth Soul Tier? It was already extremely impressive if they could barely force him to bleed a little.

Ling Han charged back at the first instant. Drawing on the power of the Black Tower, he used spatial teleportation, and with a flash, he reappeared in front of the skeletal fish. The Divine Demon Sword was drawn, and it swept out in a slash.

With him taking the role of main military force, Ling Han restrained the skeletal fish’s attacks, while the others would take the opening to exert their full battle prowess, and pour down their attacks madly on this giant fish.

In terms of pure strength, the skeletal fish could overwhelm any one of the four of them, but when it was restrained by Ling Han, it would allow the Empress, Hu Niu, and Yi to completely display their terrifying battle prowess.

Even this skeletal fish that was as strong as Earth Soul Tiers could not hold up against such an assault, and began to break off multiple bone spikes.

But this skeletal fish was incredibly ferocious. It was not willing to retreat no matter what, and was determined to fight Ling Han to the death.

If it was a more normal Earth Soul elite, it would just have to shift its attack in a different direction, and kill the Empress and the others first. Then, it could come back and fight Ling Han slowly. At least, it could ensure that it would not experience a loss.

But this skeletal fish was a little stubborn. It would target whoever hit it the hardest. Thus, Ling Han had become the main target of its attacks. It was determined to kill Ling Han and devour him, and only then would it turn its head to deal with the others.

This had decided its fate of being slowly killed by Ling Han and his group.

“Hu, Earth Soul Tier marine creatures are truly hard to kill!” Ling Han couldn’t help but remark ruefully. If the Black Tower’s Time Stop could be used at will, that would be great. Even a peak-stage Earth Soul could be insta-killed, all easy and happy.

“Your defenses are really quite good.” Yi licked his lips, light shining brightly from his golden and silver eyes, almost filling the skies with their brilliance. “I probably can’t tear through your physique at this moment yet.”

Ling Han smiled slightly. It was indeed as Yi had said. Within the Severing Mundane Tier, there was definitely not a single person that could pose a threat to him.

...Aside from Ji Wuming.

This person was a reincarnated Celestial King, and could even compel Shu Yarong, who was also a reincarnated Celestial King, to attend to him with such an incredibly humble attitude. Just what amazing technique did a Ninth Heaven Celestial King possess?

Ling Han definitely could not be rash or careless, or he would be dead before he even knew it.

“Yo, everyone is gathered.” A clear voice rang out, and a carefree figure appeared, striding over as he stepped on the water ripples with a faint smile on his face. Who could it be if not Ji Wuming?

This man was really a lingering ghost. They were just talking about him, and here he was.

“Ugly, what do you want to do?” Hu Niu jumped out. This was the only person within the same cultivation level that had caused her to experience a loss, and just the look of him made her angry and want to pick a fight.

The smile at Ji Wuming’s lips widened slightly, and he said, “I am obviously here to take your lives to help me go further on the path to the pinnacle, trampling all over this heaven and earth. You all do not have to feel sorrow. To be able to contribute for me is contributing for the entire Celestial Realm. All descendants will remember all of you eternally.”

“Ugly people will do all kinds of things for attention!” the Empress rebuked him coldly, similarly bearing anger in her voice.

Ji Wuming’s eyes swept over them, and he smilingly said, “Your levels are too low, so you are completely unable to understand all that I do, and I have no intention of making you understand, either. All you have to know is that your deaths will not be meaningless!”

Xiu, he charged out. He was first heading straight for Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Though he had been as strong as Ninth Heaven Celestial King in his last life, and had surpassed the battle prowess he had had at this point in his last life, he was not the slightest bit conceited. Instead, he was incredibly practical.

To deal with a large number of enemies, he naturally had to tear an opening at the weakest point.

This could be considered completely opposite of what the skeletal fish had done previously.

...It should be known that Ji Wuming had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in his last life, and he had spent the late stages of his life on a certain battlefield of slaughter. So how plentiful would his battle experience, especially with being surrounded and attacked from all sides, have to be?

The moment he moved, he was directly aiming for the weakest link of Ling Han and his group.

Ling Han hurriedly stretched out a hand and pressed down, drawing Bewitching Maiden Rou into the Black Tower.

Against Ji Wuming, it was like fighting the skeletal fish they had faced previously, but his intelligence and battle experience exceeded that big guy who knew how many times, and his danger level was astonishingly high.

They had to be careful, careful, and more careful.

“Hehe!” Ji Wuming looked at Ling Han meaningfully. “Then I’ll just start from you! Though your power of Divine Fetus is not strong, I am determined to obtain the treasure you possess!”

He formed his hand into a claw, and pressed directly down on Ling Han. Shua, shua, shua, multiple lights of Regulations rippled out, a total of nine colours.

Instantly, Ling Han felt a tremendous pressure. HIs Godly bones popped loudly, as if they were about to break.

What a terrifying guy!

“Hei!” Ling Han exclaimed lightly. WIth a swipe of the Divine Demon Sword, he slashed over at Ji Wuming. He was using the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords.

“The fact that Little Yuan’s Heaven Destroying Nine Swords has fallen into your hands is no dishonor to him,” Ji Wuming said with a smile, his figure flying to the side without facing Ling Han head-on. Instead, he took the opportunity to charge towards the Empress.

Peng, peng, peng, he turned his clawed hands into fists, and shot out a consecutive series of seven punches. A circular seal would be blasted out with every punch, and they went off to suppress the Empress.

Though the Empress did her best to resist, the seven seals were incredibly frightening and indestructible. They actually suppressed the Empress forcibly, as if seven mountains were weighing down on her head, and she could not move in the slightest.

Ji Wuming revealed a smile filled with killing intent as he grabbed out at the top of the Empress’s head with his right hand.

Ling Han was shocked. So Ji Wuming was only pretending to attack him. His real target was the Empress.

He hurriedly pressed lightly on himself with his left hand, and exclaimed, “Exchange!”

Hong, Ji Wuming’s palm strike landed, yet he surprisingly discovered that the Empress’s figure blurred, and it was Ling Han that had replaced her.

The palm strike landed, multiple seals shining. The top of Ling Han’s head caved in, but it still did not shatter, and then he was sent flying.

This was Ling Han using the power of Space of the Black Tower, wherein he could exchange places with any person that he had placed a specific seal on, but the distance was limited.

He had placed spatial seals on the Empress, Hu Niu, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and even Bewitching Maiden Rou, and it was because of this that he had managed to save the Empress’s life just now.

Otherwise, should this palm strike land on the Empress, even if the Empress had nine doppelgangers to share the damage, she would still inevitably die.

What a freakish Ji Wuming!
