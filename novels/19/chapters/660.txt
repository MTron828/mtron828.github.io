Chapter 661: Snatching Stones

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Henyee

Everyone felt speechless.

An enemy they’d originally thought could only be dealt with using a roundabout strategy, but both Ling Han and Hu Niu chose a frontal strategy. Furthermore, it wasn’t a rash move to show their superior might, either, as their terrifying power was right there for them to see!

Ling Han wielded his finger like he was brandishing a sword, and delivered a slash in the direction of the skeleton monster.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu . Sword Ray swiftly slashed forth, accompanied by bright white lightning. The power of lightning had greatly increased the power of Sword Ray. One had to understand that the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven was a Mystical Power, and Ling Han had reached minor accomplishment level in body of lightning. How could it not be powerful?

The skeleton monster shook wildly from the electrocution, and the multiple flashes of Sword Ray sliced it repeatedly, leaving behind many slash marks on its bones.

In theory, this kind of monster was definitely not something that could be injured by a Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator, but who asked Ling Han’s battle prowess to have exceeded the level of the Spiritual Infant Tier? Sword Ray together with Thunderclap Ninth Heaven... his current battle prowess was worth one Star of the Deity Transformation Tier at least.

Similarly, after a dozen over moves, the skeleton was slashed to bits by Ling Han, and returned once again to the dirt from whence it came.

Rest in peace, Ling Han said internally, feeling slightly displeased because the Restore Heaven Academy actually used the corpses of powerful cultivators who had died who knew how many years ago as tools—from a certain aspect, what difference was there between them and the Thousand Corpse Sect?

Thinking about it closely, there really was not much difference between the two.

The Thousand Corpse Sect wanted to turn all the people of a whole realm into Corpse Soldiers, whereas the five great sects wanted to refine them all into an alchemical pill. They both wanted to destroy all life, so which one of them could declare themselves nobler?

They were birds of the same feather!

Ling Han picked up the strange stone. Indeed, it could not be stored away into the Black Tower or a Spatial Ring; it seemed like it had a life and will of its own. With a thought, he summoned the Rock Spirit and tossed the strange stone over to it.

The Rock Spirit sniffed it for a while before suddenly opening its mouth widely. With a crack, it had swallowed the strange stone, and began to chew on it noisily like how a human being would chew on a bone. The sound caused the others to feel a soreness in their gums.

That could actually be chewed on?

“Ling Han, why did you destroy the strange stone?” Qin Lian Yue gasped in shock after momentary shock.

“That’s right. That is something that could help you become a Core Disciple,” Li Zi Xian said.

Ling Han smiled softly, and said, “It’s all right. Anyways, there’s more of it, so we’ll just take things slow.” The Rock Spirit would only eat stones that could increase its power. Since it was fond of eating it, that proved that this stone was of use to it.

After the Rock Spirit finished eating, it leaned against Ling Han’s leg and rubbed its head against him like it was a little puppy. But its strength was really too tremendous; one rub was enough to shake even the earth itself, which was incredibly terrifying.

Thankfully, Ling Han had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, and possessed amazing strength himself. If not, with the Rock Spirit rubbing against him like that, he would have been sent flying, his bones and flesh shattered from the impact.

Everyone else inhaled sharply. This puppet was very intelligent. It would actually take the initiative to play cute. Furthermore, that strength was really terrifyingly powerful.

The Rock Spirit stared at Ling Han pitifully, its mouth open wide. If it was a human being, it would most probably be salivating by now.

Ling Han knew that this guy was remembering that brick, but that brick had disappeared along with Helian Xun Xue. Even he could not find it. He did not know what had happened that Sea Girl would actually leave without a word.

“Here, I’ll give you this too!” He threw the other strange stone over to the Rock Spirit as well.

The Rock Spirit grabbed it and immediately began chewing. Though this was completely incomparable to the “brick’, but every little bit counted. It was a waste to refuse when Ling Han had given the strange stone to it.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s mind. Since the first floor of the Black Tower was the Source of Earth, then could it nurture some kind of supreme strange stone to help the Rock Spirit increase its power? He immediately communicated with Small Tower and voiced the question with his divine sense.

“Yes!” Small Tower replied crisply.

Ling Han felt a bit like he was about to go crazy, and asked, “Then why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

“You didn’t ask,” Small Tower answered calmly.

Ling Han felt a violent urge to beat someone up, and said, “Fine, then. Then give me a few hundred or a few thousand stones.”

If Small Tower actually had eyes, it would definitely roll its eyes at Ling Han. It gave a humph, and said, “Black Tower is still being restored, so how could there be so much Chaos Power to be expended? It can only supply a single stone every month or so.”

One stone per month, then. It was better than nothing.

“Then how are the effects?” Ling Han asked.

“After eating three, that rock man can break through to the Spiritual Infant Tier. After six, it can break through to the Deity Transformation Tier,” Small Tower replied calmly.

F***, so awesome?

Ling Han could not help but feel depressed. He worked so hard at his cultivation, but the Rock Spirit need only to eat a few stones and its cultivation level would gradually soar. Such a comparison could really drive him to a death by anger.

Since it was so easy for the Rock Spirit to raise its level, Ling Han did not plan to feed strange stones to the big guy anymore. He laughed, and said, “Since you’re full, then do your work responsibly.”

“Ang!” the Rock Spirit pounded on its chest like a rampaging gorilla.

Everyone once again clicked their tongues in wonder. This puppet was really too human in behavior.

They continued their way, and soon, they again spotted white bones buried underneath the ground. This time, there weren’t that few in number, either. They crawled out from underground, and charged to attack Ling Han and the others.

They all used their respective strengths and began to add credit to themselves.

However, the skeleton monsters were really too powerful. A Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator would still have a chance with a roundabout strategy to take advantage of an opening to remove the strange stone, but Flower Blossom Tier cultivators would not even have the opportunity to get near to it, as they would soon be sent flying away by the terrifying aura.

... The first round was still all right. Even though Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators were powerful, the strange winds they suffered were even more powerful, and did not allow them too much of an advantage over their Flower Blossom Tier peers. But here, the power advantage that Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators had could be seen in full.

After all, the first test was to pick those young men and women with good talent and strong determination, but this test was to pick out the geniuses among geniuses, so, naturally, only the cream of the crop would be able to charge out of the ranks.

The Rock Spirit took the position of vanguard, and charged to attack those skeleton monsters. Yet it had just charged out when it was sent flying with a single punch, and shattered into a pile of rubble. Thankfully, its core was not broken, and it soon revived.

“Ai, you are really undependable!” Ling Han shot out himself, and Hu Niu gave an excited shout as well before joining forces with Ling Han.

The two great monsters now attacked together, and even the skeleton monsters could only bear their resentment. Within a few moves, they were shattered by their combined attacks, and the strange stones instantly dropped onto the ground.

This thing could not be stored away into the Black Tower, and could only be kept on one’s body, which made Ling Han very displeased as this seriously affected his image. Thankfully, this stone was only the size of his fist; otherwise, he would really go crazy. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After half a day, he already had over twenty stones on him. Even though the light exuding from the strange stones was not too powerful, with twenty of them together, it still made for a grand scene. They made him seem almost like a light source, which illuminated brightly this gloomy and dark place completely.

But this also made Ling Han into a live target. Soon, someone made a move against him, wanting to snatch away the stones, but the result was naturally that they were looted by Ling Han instead. Not only were the strange stones they had seized, even their Spatial Rings were taken and given to Ling Han as gifts.

One day later, they all stopped to rest, and took out ingredients to cook.

Suddenly, a young man dressed in green-colored robes appeared, an arrogant expression on his face as he coldly declared to the group, “Leave the strange stones behind, and you all can get lost.”
