1282 Battling the Sword Emperor

“Lady Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, do not be fooled by this evil demon!” these disciples all called out as they sent out a signal to summon their other companions.

The average power of the disciples of the Five Sects was very strong.

For people like them, who had only cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years yet had all advanced into the Sun Moon Tier, it was not because they had all awoken their bloodline, but rather because they had taken the Realm Pill... Of course, it was not complete, but the diluted version. Otherwise, there would not have been enough to be distributed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yet even so, the overall power of the Five Sects had seen a very large improvement. They were practically no inferior to any other force of the Heavenly Body Tier.

...Without reaching the Sun Moon Tier, they would not have dared to run over to the Two Realm Battlefield to hunt Ling Han down. If they were only in the Mountain River Tier, they definitely would have been going to their deaths.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden cuddled the little beast, and said, “You have said all you need to say. If you continue to blabber nonsense, I will definitely not be merciful!”

Her eyes were menacing. Since she had already severed her relations with the Five Sects, whoever made a move on Ling Han would be attacking her.

“Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, did you not call yourself the Ling Family’s Widow, and would only live for one person?” A bout of laughter rang out from afar. In a mere instant, a young man shot over at an extraordinarily fast pace.

He bore a sword that had an ancient air to it on his back, and exuded an aura that seemed otherworldly.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over this newcomer, and his eyes involuntarily narrowed.

The Sword Emperor!

10,000 years ago, there was a total of seven Heaven Tiers in the Lower Realm. They were known as the king tiers of that generation, and the Sword Emperor was ranked in the first place, above both the Setting Sun Saber Emperor and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. In their reunion 10,000 years later, the Sword Emperor had already advanced into the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Though he was not as incredible as the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, it was still very, very exaggerated.

The Realm Pill was indeed awesome, but what was more crucial was his own natural talent. Otherwise, why would those who had cultivated more tens of thousands of years, or even an additional several hundreds of thousands years, still be in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier?

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden looked towards this old rival from the past, her expression unchanging, and said, “Is what I do any concern of yours?”

As she spoke, a few more people rushed over. This time, they were much stronger, and there was no lack of elites in the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

“Hoho!” The Sword Emperor shook his head, appearing to be disdainful.

You praised yourself as being pure and untouched, but weren’t you still moved, and gotten ‘involved with another man?’

Ling Han naturally was unwilling to allow his wife be insulted, even if it was just a misunderstanding. He spoke up, “Sword Emperor, we have not met for 10,000 years. Do you dare battle me?”

Sword Emperor?

A great many people were confused. Whom was this evil demon talking to?

Yet the Sword Emperor felt his heartbeat quicken. He had taken this name when he was in the small world, but when he entered into the Immortal Realm, he took the initiative to remove this nickname and seal it away temporarily, restoring his real name.

Otherwise, if he still called himself the Sword Emperor in the Immortal Realm, wouldn’t that be attracting hatred? Was he complaining that he wasn’t dying fast enough?

How did this brat know?

Hold on, this brat was also called Ling Han, and furthermore... the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden was willing to become hostile with her sect for his sake... so could it be?!

A shocking guess rose up in his heart, but there was still a point of doubt, and that was: if Ling Han was that person, how had he passed the time of 10,000 years?

This thought merely flashed past, and he had already found his own answer.

Time Liquid!

Since the elites of the Five Sects had accumulated their disciples throughout the generations with this item, why could Ling Han not do the same? Very long ago, the Five Sects had once been conquered by Ma Duo Bao. At the time, their foundations had almost been severed, and the Time Liquid had also all been taken.

If Ling Han obtained the Time Liquid from this channel, then everything could be logically explained.

“You are... Ling Han!” The Sword Emperor stared at Ling Han.

Ling Han knew what he meant, and so said, “Hehe, after you requested that I concoct alchemical pills for you, I secretly learnt three sword techniques from you, sorry about that.”

When he said this, the Sword Emperor no longer had any doubts. This Ling Han was not only the criminal who had come through opening the sky, but was also the Alchemy Emperor from 10,000 years ago!

No wonder his rate of cultivation was so fast—with the best quality alchemical pills available to him every day, how could it not be fast?

“I never thought that you were actually someone that had long since died!” The Sword Emperor’s expression became menacing. “If I had known that you would’ve become such a big threat to the sect... I really should have killed you long ago!”

Though Ling Han was his equal in cultivation level 10,000 years ago, in terms of battle prowess... He really was a joke.

“Zhang Heng, do you want to die?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden flew into a thunderous rage, her killing intent even stronger than the Sword Emperor’s.

The Sword Emperor’s real name was Zhang Heng. After he came to the Immortal Realm, he took the name of Zhang Heng, no longer being called the Sword Emperor.

“Wife, allow me.” Ling Han restrained the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. He had long since wanted to battle once more with the Sword Emperor and the Setting Sun Saber Emperor. Now, the Sword Emperor’s cultivation level was above his, so it could not be considered as bullying him too much.

This ignited his fighting spirit.

“Be careful, he is a four-star genius!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said in a low voice. The reason why she had rushed to speak up for him was because she did not want Ling Han to fight the Sword Emperor.

Ling Han’s battle prowess was at the early stage of the consummate level at most, and he could fight someone in the middle stage of the consummate level, while the Sword Emperor was in the late stage of the high extreme, and was also a four-star genius at that, so his battle prowess was at about the late stage of the consummate level. His ultimate battle prowess still had a gap of one star.

This meant that Ling Han would definitely lose.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Don’t worry. I am still unable to beat you now, but as for this guy, hehe, he’s just a piece of cake!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden rolled her eyes. This guy was really petty. Didn’t she just suppress him a few times in the past? Did he have to keep those few times in mind constantly like this?

“Sword Emperor, come, let’s battle!” Ling Han challenged the Sword Emperor.

The Sword Emperor looked nostalgic, and said, “It has been a very long time since I have been called the Sword Emperor. However, there will be one day that I will let this name once again be known!”

What great ambition!

In the Immortal Realm, titles like King, Majestic Emperor, and Imperial Emperor could not be used simply like that, because the Royal Empire, Majestic Empire, and Imperial Empire existed. If you used it anyway, you would commit a taboo.

For example, if Zhang Heng was to call himself the Sword Emperor, then wouldn’t that be the equivalent of placing himself on the same level as Eternal River Tier? What would the Heavenly Body Tiers think about that?

A mere Sun Moon Tier wanted to climb over their heads?

That was purely courting death!

Now that Zhang Heng said that he would make the name of the Sword Emperor once again become known, it meant that he was confident that he could advance into the Eternal River Tier, and he deserved to be admired merely for this ambitious spirit.

Ling Han nodded. This was the Sword Emperor that he knew.

He said, “On the basis of our previous relations, I hope you can leave the Heaven’s Sword Palace and pursue your own path if you lose.”

“Haha, say this again after you beat me!” Zhang Heng drew his sword. Weng, a frightening murderous aura instantly soared into the skies. His fighting spirit and sword intent had fused together, forming a Divine Sword that seemed capable of even slicing apart the heavens.

Ling Han sighed internally. In mere terms of Sword Dao, the other’s level of mastery was indeed superior to his because of his “single-mindedness”—Ling Han was studying too many fields. Alchemy occupied a very large part of his concentration, and there was also a considerable number of other assorted fields.

However, precisely because of these assorted other fields, the present him was born.

Ling Han did not draw the Divine Demon Sword, but rather clenched his hands into fists. Divine patterns appeared on his fists, causing these two fists to grow continuously in size until they became almost like mountains.

‘I punch!’

He took the initiative to attack.
