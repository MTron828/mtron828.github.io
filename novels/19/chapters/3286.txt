Chapter 3287 - 3287: Everyone Gathers

The reason why the improved Qi Return Pills could be sold at such a high price was because there were few of them. However, after mass production, the price would definitely decrease, but he believed that it would not be difficult to sell them for a hundred thousand.

The key was how much the cost of the ingredients were.

As for the ingredients, it was about 17,000 Dark North Coins per furnace, and

the finished product was three to four pills. In theory, the cost of one pill was

about 5,000, but considering that only Ling Han could achieve a 100% success

rate, the cost would definitely rise.

According to a 50% success rate, the cost of ingredients would be 10,000, and the manpower would be counted as another 10 ,ooo. Then, the net profit would be 80,000, and Ling Han would get 40,000 even if he only took half of it.

Most importantly, Ling Han didn’t need to lift a finger. He could earn 40,000 for each pill sold, so he was naturally very pleased.

Moreover, there were also the improved versions of the Mystical Power Pill and the Meridian Exploration Pill. Although the price of each pill was lower, the demand was greater. He believed that the benefits would not be small.

This was only the beginning. He could still improve more pill recipes in the future.

Alright, there was no need to think about money for now. The problem now was spending money.

He was looking for the remaining seven main ingredients to concoct the antidote for the Soul Departing Pill. He already had an idea. As expected of the capital, as long as one had money, there was nothing that could not be bought.

Three days later, Xuanyuan Dingguo came to find him. They could set off now.

Ling Han asked Lian Xuerong to take care of Huan Xue for him while he set off alone. After thinking for a moment, he decided not to bring that little lecherous pig along. Although bringing this little lecherous pig along would increase his safety, it would also increase the factor of instability.

Forget it, let it continue to harm the female students of the academy and take advantage of them.

Ling Han and Xuanyuan Dingguo first arrived at the entrance of the academy to meet up with the others for this operation.

After a while, a burly young man arrived. He looked to be about 24 or 25 years old.

“Come, let me introduce you,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said. “This is General Vajra’s seventh grandson, Qin Xinghuo.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Brother Qin.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

No wonder his physique was astonishing. As the descendant of the General Vajra, he was definitely good at body refinement.

Qin Xinghuo wasn’t dissatisfied. Although Ling Han didn’t have much status, his potential was too great. He was known as the second Hong Tianbu, and his future achievements were limitless. Thus, it was normal for him to be arrogant.

He also nodded at Ling Han, and did not say anything else.

Ling Han knew that Xuanyuan Dingguo must have paid a price to get him a place on the group for this exploration into the catacombs. Otherwise, who would be able to bring more people without permission?

He looked at Xuanyuan Dingguo, who smiled at him.

“Don’t make eyes at me, the two of you. If you want to be gay, hurry up and get a room,” Qin Xinghuo said with a smile.

“That mouth of yours!” Xuanyuan Dingguo shook his head.

Logically speaking, Qin Xinghuo and Xuanyuan Dingguo should be from two different generations, but the two of them didn’t seem to care about seniority.

After a while, another person came. However, this was a charming woman.

Xuanyuan Dingguo immediately leaned close to Ling Han’s ear and said, “This is the granddaughter of General Moon Eclipse, Yin Xiujing.”

Ling Han nodded to himself. General Moon Eclipse was the only female among the Four Great Generals, and she also had the fewest offspring. After all, it was impossible for her to have children just out of boredom.

However, although she only had one son, this son had countless wives and concubines. He had given her many grandchildren, and this Yin Xiujing was one of the most outstanding ones.

“Try not to talk to her. This poisonous rose likes to seduce people and then step on them,” Xuanyuan Dingguo added.

Ugh.

“What, are you making things up about me?” Yin Xiujing walked over with a twist of her slender waist. Her figure was very hot, and the parts that should be slender were slender. Her small waist really could only be held in one hand, completely like the body of a snake.

However, she still had a peach-like butt. Every sway of her butt was seductive.

Xuanyuan Dingguo and Qin Xinghuo both deliberately turned their heads away. This was called out of sight, out of mind. Only Ling Han remained calm and composed with a faint smile on his face, and his gaze was neither avoiding nor evasive.

Yin Xiujing’s beautiful eyes couldn’t help but light up. Xuanyuan Dingguo and Qin Xinghuo could be considered old friends of hers.They had known about her personality for a long time, so she hadn’t been able to toy with the two of them. She was just worrying about how boring this trip would be, and now there was a newcomer?

Now, she did not have to worry about the long journey and having nothing to while away the time.

“Yo, so this is Ling Han?” she said with a smile, revealing a set of snow-white teeth, exuding a bewitching allure.

She was a natural vixen.

In the face of such flirtatiousness, nine out of ten men would definitely not be able to control themselves. However, Ling Han was used to seeing all kinds of beauties. Some were as cold as ice, some were as passionate as fire, and some were as cold as ice on the surface, but as passionate as fire when they were aroused. How could he possibly lose his composure in front of Yin Xiujing?

“Senior Sister Yin,” he said with a smile.

“Oh, why are you treating me like an outsider? Call me Big Sister,” Yin Xiujing said coquettishly, her voice filled with temptation.

Xuanyuan Dingguo and Qin Xinghuo looked at each other and thought to themselves, ‘Here she comes. She’s going to cause trouble again.’ However, they didn’t want to draw fire onto themselves, so they naturally didn’t have any intention of interrupting. In any case, Yin Xiujing knew her limits. At most, she would make people burn with desire, but they couldn’t vent it. She wouldn’t play until the other party was dead or crippled.

Ling Han merely smiled. What a joke. He was an old monster who had lived in the Genesis World for more than an epoch. How could he call such a little girl in her twenties Big Sister?

Even if the flow of time was different, it was still impossible.

The more Ling Han resisted, the more interested Yin Xiujing became. This was because after conquering Ling Han who was like this, she would also feel a greater sense of accomplishment.

“Hehehe, looks like I’m the last one.” Another young man appeared. He carried a thick and solid bag on his back.

“Eh, Tang Yue, you didn’t manage to borrow a spatial Spirit Tool?” Qin Xinghuo asked.

Tang Yue shook his head. “Don’t remind me. If my father refuses to lend me the spatial Spirit Tool, can I still snatch it?”

Ling Han took a look. Xuanyuan Dingguo, Qin Xinghuo, and Yin Xiujing didn’t bring any luggage. From the looks of it, they had probably borrowed a spatial Spirit Tool. Otherwise, even with their statuses, it would be impossible for them to obtain such a treasure.

With such a comparison, it could be seen how lucky he was.

“Alright, let’s set off,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said, also helping Ling Han out of his predicament, because Yin Xiujing was about to use all her tactics on him.

The five of them set off. Four of them were descendants of the Four Great

Generals, and no other person was qualified to be companions with them.

They still attached great importance to this operation. They didn’t even bring along their trusted aides because they didn’t want to share any of their gains. In addition, it was their abilities. If they weren’t strong enough, they would only be a burden. One had to know that the number of Purple Wasps in the cave was in the millions. Comparing their numbers with that number?

‘Haha.’

From this, it could be seen that Xuanyuan Dingguo had definitely paid a considerable price to bring Ling Han along, sacrificing a portion of the benefits that he was due.

Ling Han nodded to himself. Xuanyuan Dingguo was a person who knew when to advance and when to retreat. He was worth making friends with..
