Chapter 1375 Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree

Once upon a time, Azure Rain City had actually been an uninhibited mountain range.

However, at some point in time, the four major clans had decided to settle in this place. After countless years of development, this place had finally become a holy land for alchemy that attracted countless alchemists from all corners of the world.

As for the specific reason, it was because the entrance to the Medicine King’s Cave lay in this piece of land. Moreover, it was in order to hide the Treasure Forest Pavilion’s true foundation that Azure Rain City was built. Who could imagine that there existed the entrance to an ancient mystery realm under this city?

Ling Han and Zhang Feng were both asked to vow to never reveal the secret of the Medicine King’s Cave to others. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be allowed to enter.

Afterward, several mighty beings appeared. These were Eternal River Tier elites, and they used precious treasures to open the entrance to the Medicine King’s Cave.

Countless years ago, the ancestors of the four major clans had obtained the key to the Medicine King’s Cave. It was also because of this that the Treasure Forest Pavilion had been founded.

The entrance shimmered into being. This was a revolving light door, and only those who satisfied the entry conditions were allowed to enter. Otherwise, they would be rejected by the light door. At least even Eternal River Tier elites weren’t able to force their way inside. From this, it could be discerned that the owner of this Medicine King’s Cave had at least been a Genesis Tier Saint.

Moreover, taking into account the fact that the inheritances in the Medicine King’s Cave were all alchemical pills, it could be determined that the owner of this cave had at least been a level 17 alchemist!

His inheritances were naturally extremely precious.

Of course, it wasn’t only the Lin Clan that was entering the mystery realm right now. The three other major clans of the Treasure Forest Pavilion were also entering. According to the rules of the four major clans, the Han Clan would enter first this time, followed by the Lin Clan, and then finally the Shi Clan and the Huang Clan.

When it was the Lin Clan’s turn to enter, everyone entered in groups. The first group to enter was naturally the Beisha Branch. After all, they had won first place in the intra-clan competition. The second group to enter was the Anyuan Branch. This branch was led by Lin Zihong, who had a look of haughtiness on his face at this moment. It was as if the entire world were bowing before him.

Xiu!

Ling Han felt a tug on his body, and before he knew it, he had already arrived in some unfamiliar place.

This was a completely new world, where the air was suffused with the fragrance of medicines.

This was the first level of the Medicine King’s Cave!

Gazing around, he could see that this level was filled with rolling hills that were lush with medicinal plants. There were many people pacing back and forth among the medicinal fields, meticulously caring for the medicinal plants.

‘There are... actually people in this place?

‘Wait, no!’

Ling Han immediately shook his head. He activated his Eye of Truth and observed the people more carefully. In fact, these weren’t people at all, but instead a population of puppets. It was just that their appearance and demeanor were almost identical with real humans’.

Lin Yuqi appeared beside Ling Han, and explained, “The Medicine King’s Cave has nine levels, and each level has a supremely valuable medicine. However, this valuable medicine is incredibly difficult to obtain. This is because of the puppets that guard it. We’re only allowed to enter this mystery realm once every 100,000 years, so we have to rely on these puppets to maintain the medicine fields. Thus, we definitely can’t damage them.

“In other words, we have to obtain the supremely valuable medicine without hurting the puppets. This is a tremendously difficult task.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. If they obliterated all of these puppets, obtaining the medicines would naturally be easy. However, that would be killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Were they going to harvest the medicines once and never return again?

The four major clans had strict rules in place, stating that those who entered the mystery realm were not allowed to damage the puppets that guarded the medicine fields. This was an intelligent and far-sighted rule.

“However, the highest level that we’ve reached is only the eighth level. As for the ninth level... No one has ever been able to enter it before,” Lin Yuqi continued. “Judging from the medicines of the first eight levels, the ninth level definitely contains a pill recipe for a Saint Pill!”

After reaching level 17, alchemical pills could be called Saint Pills.

“Yuqi, in order to raise our efficiency, how about we lead a team each and each go our own way?” Lin Zihong immediately suggested. He had already endured for a long time, and he was already nearing the limits of his patience. He didn’t want to see the detestable Ling Han any longer.

Lin Yuqi couldn’t wish for a better idea, so she immediately nodded in agreement. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lin Zihong pointed at Ling Han, and ordered, “You, follow me!”

“No way!” Lin Yuqi hurriedly said. “He’s my person, so he’s got to follow me!”

Flames of fury blazed in Lin Zihong’s heart. ‘Oh, you two merely had a trip together, and yet he’s already your person?’

He humphed, and said, “Don’t forget what the branch leader said before we left! I’m the leader of this trip!”

Lin Yuqi shook her head in her mind. She naturally understood what Lin Zihong was planning to do. In fact, she was actually trying to save him!

Ling Zihong naturally didn’t know that Ling Han had even defeated Lin Feng with ease before. Moreover, Lin Feng’s strength was definitely no weaker than Lin Zihong’s.

“It’s my choice who I follow or don’t follow,” Ling Han said calmly. “I’m merely an honorary elder, but none of you can control me. Since we’ve entered this place, let’s each go our own way.”

After saying this, he immediately dashed forward, activating the Star Plucking Step and disappearing into the distance. He was as quick as lightning.

Because of his relationship with Lin Yuqi, he decided to give her face and avoid conflict with Lin Zihong again.

However, he wouldn’t tolerate the same threat three times. If Lin Zihong was insistent on seeking death, he wouldn’t mind being merciless and granting his wish.

Lin Yuqi couldn’t help but sigh in her mind. She knew that Ling Han was incredibly powerful. Thus, with him present, they would definitely be able to obtain a significantly more bountiful yield. However, who told Lin Zihong to be such a petty and narrow-minded person?

‘This is a good outcome too. At least they won’t clash with each other again.’

“Coward!” Lin Zihong said with a sneer. Since Ling Han had fled, there was no point splitting into two groups anymore. However, how could Lin Yuqi agree to this? In any case, it was Lin Zihong who had suggested splitting into two groups anyway.

Eventually, they still ended up splitting into two groups.

Lin Shuying and her branch members weren’t far away, and upon seeing this, a confident smile immediately appeared on her face. She wouldn’t mind taking advantage of their weakness and capturing Ling Han. After throwing down some words, she hurriedly left to pursue Ling Han.

However, how quick was Ling Han? Moreover, she had only just advanced to the Sun Moon Tier. So, how could she catch up to him? In the blink of an eye, she had already lost track of Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Ling Han continued to scan the medicine fields below him as he flew forward. If they were only ordinary Godly medicines, he wouldn’t waste his time harvesting them. After all, there was already a huge amount of these Godly medicines in the Black Tower.

After a few hours, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. A tree that was almost 30 meters tall had appeared before him. This tree was as dazzling and crystal-like as an emerald, and its trunk was a peculiar purple-red in color. Moreover, the crown of this tree opened up like an umbrella, making it appear extremely attractive and beautiful.

Of course, it wasn’t the peculiar nature of this tree that stopped Ling Han in his tracks. Rather, it was because this tree was an extremely rare Level 10 Divine Tree!

This was the Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree.

This type of Divine Tree was extremely peculiar. In the beginning, it would blossom and produce fruits in 1,000,000 years. However, these fruits would only be Level Two Godly medicine. Following this, it would blossom after another 2,000,000 years. However, at that time, the fruits would be Level Three Godly Medicines.

Then, its fruits would reach level four after 4,000,000 years, and then level five after 8,000,000 years. Eventually, the fruits would become Level 10 Godly Medicine after some 200,000,000 years.

At each stage, the trunk of the Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree would be of a different color. Only after blossoming nine times would its trunk become purple-red. Afterward, it would blossom and produce fruits once every 200,000,000 years, for a total of nine times. After nine times, the Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree would wilt and die.

It was because of this that the Divine Tree was called the Purple Jade Nine Dao Tree.

This was a Level 10 Divine Tree, so the fruits that it bore were naturally Level 10 Divine Fruits.

Right now, the Divine Tree was full of fruits that still appeared a little unripe. Perhaps it would take several million years for these fruits to ripen. However, to Ling Han, uprooting this tree and planting it into the Black Tower was the best way to go!

“Fortunately I left by myself. Otherwise, that bewitching woman would definitely stop me from uprooting this tree,” Ling Han said with a smile. “The Medicine King’s Cave was only discovered by the Treasure Forest Pavilion, and it’s not as if they actually own this place, so I won’t be going too far by uprooting and taking this tree.”
