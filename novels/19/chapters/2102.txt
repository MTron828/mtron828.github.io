Chapter 2103: A dark secret technique

It was not that Yang Xiao had never come into contact with secret techniques. There were some secret techniques that could allow one to experience a burst of three to four times their usual battle prowess, but all those required you to induce self-harm, or would cause very great aftereffects in your future.

But a boost of battle prowess by 10 times… was too much. There was no secret technique that could accomplish that.

“Brother Si, you’re kidding, right?” Yang Xiao asked. If there really existed this kind of secret technique, it would be much, much too awesome.

“Xiao Cheng.” Xiao Cheng waved a hand.

Immediately, a youth walked out, and cupped his hands in obeisance towards Xiong Si. “Lord Si!”

Xiong Si nodded, and asked Yang Xiao, “You know of Xiao Cheng, right?”

Yang Xiao nodded. Xiao Cheng was that person that had entered into a conflict with him all those years ago. Though hundreds of thousands of years had passed since then, it was as if it had just happened yesterday to him.

“Hehe, why don’t you guys have a spar?” Xiong Si asked with a smile.

“Young Master Yang, please!” Xiao Cheng took a few steps back, and went into position.

Yang Xiao revealed an arrogant expression. At that time, he had only just advanced into the fourth severance, and Xiao Cheng had stagnated at fourth severance for who knew how many years. He had polished his battle prowess to an incredibly strong extent, but even then, so what? He had still been defeated at his hands!

That was because he was a king tier, and was invincible among his peers.

Presently, he had reached the peak-stage fourth severance, and it was even more impossible that Xiao Cheng was a match for him. He only needed 10 moves, no, three. Within three moves, he would be able to suppress his opponent.

‘Huh?’

A possibility flashed through his mind. Could it be that Xiao Cheng had taught Xiao Cheng the secret technique to increase one’s battle prowess? Th-th-th-this, how could this be?

If even such a character like Xiao Cheng could learn such a profound secret technique, what justice was there left in this world?

He thought thus in his heart, and also slowly went into position as well. “Then let’s exchange a few moves.”

Xiu, Xiao Cheng immediately moved. He shot out a punch, and there was no wave of Regulations, yet it was like a darkness was approaching to swallow him up, possessing endless might.

“What?!” Yang Xiao was shocked, and hurriedly shot out his own fist to greet the incoming strike.

Peng!

The two fists crashed into one another, and a shock wave surged out from where the two fists collided, spreading out in all directions in the main hall. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xiong Si chuckled, and pressed out with his right hand.?Weng, a massive sphere of darkness appeared, trapping all the impact from this shock wave within.?Weng, weng, weng, energy surged out madly, but the dark sphere was still not destroyed.

He was a Yin Soul super elite, so it was naturally no big deal for him to disperse the shock wave from a fourth-severance-level battle.

Teng, teng, teng.?Both Yang Xiao and Xiao Cheng took seven steps back consecutively, and then steadied their footing respectively.

In this exchange, they had come out in a tie.

Yet Yang Xiao paled in shock. How could this be possible? There had clearly been no changes to the other’s cultivation level. He was still at the peak-stage fourth severance, and it was impossible that he could suddenly acquire the aptitude of a king tier—if he really had had that kind of natural talent, he would have long since been taken in as disciple by some great sect. Wouldn’t that be much better than being a local tyrant and scoundrel here?

But why had Yang Xiao only managed to battle his opponent to a tie?

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, he was already capable of suppressing the other, and now he had reached the peak-stage fourth severance. Logically, he should have been able to easily overcome his opponent, but why had they come out in a tie now instead?

A tenfold boost of battle prowess?

Hiss, this could allow an ordinary cultivator to become a king tier!

Then if he learned it, would he be able to make the leap from king tier to emperor tier?

His heart beat wildly. If he was an emperor tier, he would be able to become a core disciple, and if he was even more powerful, and leaped into the ranks of monarch tiers, there was a chance that he could become a Holy Son!

Holy Son!

The moment he thought of these words, his scalp had become numb from excitement. What disciple did not want to become a Holy Son? This was a symbol of status, and also represented supreme glory, and was also a recognition of strength.

As for anyone that became a Holy Son, as long as they could continue living, there was not one that did not eventually become a Celestial King.

Xiu, Xiao Cheng charged over again.

Peng, peng, peng, peng.

?The two men continued to battle intensely. Yang Xiao discovered to his shock that Xiao Cheng had indeed increased his battle prowess by 10 times, no, it was more than 10 times. Furthermore, there seemed to be no limits unlike ordinary secret techniques, such as it could only take effect for a short period of time.

“Stop,” Xiong Si called out loudly, pressing down his hands, and both Xiao Cheng and Yang Xiao stopped.

“My dear brother, how is it?” Xiong Si looked at Yang Xiao smilingly, looking like he was absolutely certain that the latter would bite the bait.

Yang Xiao’s heart beat wildly, and he could not care any longer about whatever pride he should have as the disciple of a great sect. He hurriedly exclaimed, “Brother Si, please teach me.”

Xiong Si was internally pleased with himself. Though fourth severance was not even worth a mention in his eyes, he still felt very pleased when having a disciple of a great sect to adopt such a humble attitude in front of him. He clapped a hand onto Yang Xiao’s shoulder. “My good brother, what relationship do we have? Whatever I have, I will naturally share with you!”

“Thank you, Brother Si!” Yang Xiao was really quite grateful. He had never realized that the leader of a gang of scoundrels could actually be so pleasing to his eyes.

“Actually, the cultivation of this secret technique is very simple. You only have to believe in a deity,” Xiong Si explained calmly.

“As simple as that?” Yang Xiao naturally did not believe it.

“If my dear brother does not believe me, you can immediately try it. However, let me be frank. The matter of this secret technique definitely cannot be told to another person,” Xiong Si said solemnly.

Yang Xiao nodded, but he did not take it seriously.

Wasn’t that natural? If he possessed such a secret technique, how could he possibly teach it to another? He would definitely monopolize it! Only an idiot like Xiong Si would actually teach it to others. Had his head been kicked by a donkey?

“Come, dear brother, come, let me first bring you to pay your greetings to the honored statue of the Deity.” Xiong Si slung an arm around Yang Xiao’s shoulders, and they left.

***

Yang Xiao had been gone for three days and three nights, and it was only on the morning of the fourth day that he returned.

Chen Shuangshuang was naturally curious where this senior brother had gone, but Yang Xiao only said that he had been to a gathering of friends, gotten drunk, and forgot about the time, and that was his explanation for his absence.

Ling Han felt a little strange. Hadn’t this guy already arranged his plans to put on a show of playing the hero to save the beauty? Then, he should take advantage of the opportunity so that things wouldn’t be too late. Why had he disappeared for as long as three days?

At first, Ling Han had thought that after he returned, Yang Xiao, too, would return not too long later. If he had known, his divided soul should have stayed there for a while longer.

“Come, Junior Sister, let me bring you somewhere fun. Then, we will set out to return back to the sect tomorrow,” Yang Xiao said smilingly, a darkness hidden within the depths of his eyes. However, it was concealed very, very well, and even Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu had not discovered it with their insight.

It was unfortunate that Xiao Gu was not here, as he had gone to find someone new to mimic. Otherwise, he would probably be able to tell that something was off.

Chen Shuangshuang could not refuse Yang Xiao’s enthusiasm, and thus agreed to go together. They went to a valley. It was completely filled with blue mulberry trees, and looked like an expansive blue ocean at first glance. It was indeed very beautiful, and even the Empress, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and Bewitching Maiden Rou liked it very much.

Hu Niu naturally was the unusual one. She was yawning in boredom. She would rather eat a few more chicken drumsticks than waste her time here.

What was so fun about this? Weren’t they just blue tree leaves?

Just at this moment, the mulberry trees swayed, and seven men all dressed in different styles walked out of the forest. When they discovered the Empress and the others, their eyes immediately widened as they stared.

Such beauty, too beautiful!

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. No wonder I have heard the magpies cry the moment I woke up this morning, so there would indeed be something pleasant happening today.[1].” Among the seven people, a young man dressed in green robes clapped his fan as he surveyed the Empress and the other women.

Of course, his focus was placed on the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou. After all, the three women were the most beautiful, and their features were also the most distinguishing.

The rogues were here?

[1] In Chinese culture, the magpie is called 喜鹊, of which the first character is related to words such as like and happiness, and superstition has it that they are bringers of happiness and good fortune.
