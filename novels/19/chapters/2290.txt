Chapter 2291: Youth

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

The silver vulture gave a violent screech as it instantly folded its wings and swooped down. Its wings cut through the air like sharp blades, creating a vacuum in its surroundings.

It was as quick as lightning.

“Go to the cavern entrance!” Ling Han shouted. At the same time, he grabbed Hu Niu and the others as he immediately dashed away.

The others all faltered briefly before immediately coming to their senses. They also ran back to the cavern entrance.

The silver vulture forcefully beat its wings, changing its rapid dive into a quick glide. It then extended its claws, grabbing at Ling Han and the others. It was truly a powerful Holy Beast. It was clearly still dozens of meters away from them, yet the permeation of its terrifying might was so overwhelming Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

that they felt as if their skin were about to tear.

Only Ling Han was unfazed. His cultivation level had fallen, yet his physique hadn’t become weaker. It was still incredibly powerful. In fact, he could face this attack head-on and still remain unfazed. How could he feel uncomfortable with the mere might of the Eighth Lotus Holy Beast alone?

The arrival of the silver vulture’s attack was imminent.

Peng!

However, its entire body was blasted back by the wind, and it couldn’t put up any resistance at all.

In the face of that terrifying wind, even a cultivation of the Eighth Lotus was useless.

Everyone roared with laughter. Not only had they escaped from great danger, but they had even caused that silver vulture to become so disheveled. They had exacted revenge, and this filled them with delight.

After a while, the silver vulture composed itself, and violently swooped toward them again.

Peng!

However, when it arrived in the region of the violent winds, it was instantly grabbed by the air currents and sent flying into the distance. It instantly vanished from sight.

“Big bird, why don’t you come again, huh?!” Hu Niu waved her arms at the large vulture, provoking it to attack again.

“Come on, we’re waiting for you here!” the others also shouted in a mocking tone.

The silver vulture circled in the sky. However, it didn’t make any reckless moves to attack them again. It had already developed deep apprehension for those powerful winds.

It attempted to attack them several more times, yet it ultimately chose to give up. With a flap of its wings, it flew into the distance.

Ling Han and the others didn’t dare to let their guard down. Instead, they remained alert, afraid that the large vulture would suddenly return again. After waiting for three days, and seeing no sign of the large vulture in the sky, they finally descended the mountain and set off again.

This time, however, they didn’t dare to fly through the sky. Doing so would make them a huge target.

They traversed across the land, but it wasn’t long before everyone trained their gaze on Ling Han. This was because his entire body was red, making him stick out like a sore thumb against the snow-covered land.

Ling Han chuckled in response. With a single thought, his skin instantly became snow-white.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others were all astonished. Even though changing the color of one’s skin was extremely easy, ordinary monarch tiers were far too proud to do such a thing. Changing one’s own appearance was naturally a humiliating act.

However, before they had even complained, Ling Han had already taken the initiative to change his own skin color. This was absolutely astounding.

‘What they didn’t know was that Ling Han’s identity as a demon was already a disguise in the first place. Thus, he naturally couldn’t care less about changing his skin color.

“This person knows when to yield and when not to yield. How terrifying.’

Even though they didn’t fly, their speed was still insane, and they arrived at the foot of the mountain in no time. Their vision was still filled with endless snow. Although they were all at the Severing Mundane Tier, if they stayed here for too long, they would still feel a spine-chilling cold.

They headed away from the mountain, and after walking for around 10 days, they finally exited the snowy plains. They saw an expanse of lush green before them, and this rejuvenated their spirits.

The snowy plains had transformed into a boundless stretch of grassy plains. Along with it, their mood also brightened up.

They continued forward, and the grassy plains also remained unchanging. In some places, the grass was only an inch long, while in other places, it would reach almost a meter in height. In fact, there were even places where the grass would become several meters tall. It was much like a miniature forest.

After walking for so many days, they finally decided to stop for a rest. After all, they had come across a Holy Beast before, so it was best to remain vigilant.

As such, they chose to rest amid a patch of tall grass. They would use the grass as a natural camouflage.

They made the most of every minute to rest. After traveling for so many days, they indeed felt slightly fatigued.

“Hmm?

Everyone was suddenly astonished by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.

“I’s a person!” they immediately exclaimed. This could be determined by them thanks to the pattern of the footsteps. The being only had two legs, so this pretty much eliminated everything apart from humanoid beings.

Perhaps someone had arrived here before them?

They all shook their heads. This was extremely unlikely. After all, they had only arrived here after removing the corpse that had blocked the entrance to the cavern. Of course, they couldn’t discount the possibility that someone had shrunk down in size, and created a small gap to enter.

“They’re close!”

They all prepared for battle. Judging by the speed of the person, their cultivation level wasn’t high.

Whoosh!

A figure soared past overhead, allowing them to observe them clearly. This was a youth who was only 15 or 16 years old. He was shirtless, and even though he wasn’t tall, his body was firm with muscles.

He was from the Angel Race, and he had a pair of wings on his back. However, these wings were pitifully small. At full stretch, they only measured a mere 60 centimeters across. Surprisingly, however, there was also a pair of horns on his head. This was clearly a unique feature of the Demon Race.

The youth held an iron trident in his right hand, and the golden wrist guard on his forearm also reflected the dazzling light.

Ling Han and the others immediately understood why this youth was fleeing. This was because a gigantic silver wolf was bounding after him, attempting to capture him.

However, they immediately calmed down. This wolf was only at the Fourth Leaf of the Fifth Lotus. In other words, they could defeat it with a single glare.

However, the youth was only at the Second Leaf of the Fifth Lotus, which put him at a huge disadvantage against the wolf. He was naturally no match for it.

After the youth and wolf passed, they all stood back up. With their cultivation, concealing themselves from this person and wolf was no difficult task.

They exchanged glances, and they could all see the astonishment on each others’ faces. This was because this youth was clearly too weak to have entered from that cavern entrance on the snowy mountain.

This was an indigenous person!

Just where in the world was this place?

They followed the youth, and they were in no hurry to interfere.

The youth continued to flee, yet his speed was no match for the wolf’s. The distance between them grew smaller and smaller. In less than 15 minutes, the wolf arrived behind him, and it swiped at the youth’s exposed back with a stretch of its right paw’s claws.

Right at this moment, the youth let out a loud roar as he stamped his right foot and suddenly turned around. He faced the gigantic wolf, and violently thrust his iron trident forward.

The wolf extended its claws to block, yet it actually failed to push the trident aside. It was as if the youth’s strength had instantaneously grown by a great amount.

Pu!

The trident stabbed the wolf’ left eye, sinking deep into its skull.

Peng!

The wolf counterattacked, sending the youth flying. However, it had no energy to continue pursuing him. Instead, it continued to jump around, with blood spraying from its left eye. It howled in grief.

Pu!

The trident finally fell out, and the wolf used its remaining right eye to search for the youth. It wanted to kill him.

However, even though the wolf didn’t see Ling Han, it saw the dozen or so other people.

It had suffered severe wounds, and even its brain had been heavily wounded. As such, how could it still think properly? Upon seeing people, it immediately lunged over with no hesitation at all.

“P*ss off!” a monarch tier shouted.

Pa!

The wolf instantly transformed into a cloud of blood..
