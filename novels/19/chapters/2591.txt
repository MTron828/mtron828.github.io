Chapter 2592: Interrogation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘That’s right!’

Zhao Shuang’s eyes lit up. Thinking about it carefully, how many second-generation young masters could still rival his status?

There were a few, but only a very measly few.

In this sense, he truly needed to express his gratitude toward the killer. This person had eliminated many of his opponents, allowing him to act even more wantonly among the second-generation young masters.

“Oh, indeed! We actually failed to realize this!”

“Hahaha! Brother Zhao is about to become a peerless individual!”

“We need to wholeheartedly thank that killer.”

“Hopefully he assassinates a few more people, allowing Brother Zhao to become the most powerful young master.”

Everyone roared with laughter. If Zhao Shuang became the most powerful young master, their status would naturally soar as well.

Zhao Shuang’s mood immediately improved. He had been extremely worried over the past few days, afraid that the killer might appear in his room at any moment. However, thinking carefully, not a single assassination had occurred in the past six months after the lords had marched off to battle. It was clear that the culprit was also under a lot of pressure, and didn’t dare to act so wantonly anymore.

With this in mind, Zhao Shuang immediately felt at ease. He raised his glass and started to drink with everyone else.

Ling Han had initially wanted to act after Zhao Shuang finished his feast. However, these people were far too profligate, and they continued to drink with no end in sight. They showed no signs of ending the feast.

With the energy of Celestial Kings, they could drink for 10 years straight without any problem.

Ling Han gave up on waiting. He had already familiarized himself with this residence. There was only a single Seventh Heaven Celestial King standing guard, and this person was indeed powerful enough to be his opponent. However, Ling Han was confident that this Celestial King wouldn’t notice anything out of the ordinary if he acted now.

Ling Han silently activated the Regulations of Space, sealing off the entire hall. This way, he wouldn’t need to worry even if he caused a huge ruckus. The Seventh Heaven Celestial King wouldn’t be able to detect any abnormal fluctuation.

After finishing his preparations, Ling Han materialized in the hall.

“Huh?”

Ling Han’s sudden appearance caused everyone to falter. However, in the next instant, they all stared at him with their faces ashen and their mouths agape.

Li Long!

They had just been speaking about him, and now he had truly arrived. In fact, they had just been wishing for him to kill a few more second-generation young masters, thereby allowing their “Brother Zhao” to become the sole leader of this generation. However, they had instead brought this misfortune upon themselves.

“L-L-L-Li Long!” someone stammered, their lips quivering in terror.

“Guards!”

“Save me!”

Commotion instantly broke out, with everyone screaming for their lives. They all knew that they were no match for Ling Han. Thus, they could only ask powerful elites to come over to save them.

Ling Han paid no heed to this. With his divine sense enveloping the area, he could easily grasp the situation inside the hall. Here, the most powerful Celestial King was only at the Second Heaven. Moreover, they were only an emperor tier. In other words, he could kill them with a single thought.

“L-Li Long, what do you want?!” Zhao Shuang asked as he forced himself to calm down. He needed to buy time so that the Seventh Heaven Celestial King could rush over to save them.

Ling Han smiled faintly, saying, “I’m here to ask you a few questions.” He sat down before turning to the trembling maidservant next to him, and saying, “Please pour me some wine, thanks.”

The maidservant shuddered before hurriedly pouring Ling Han some wine.

She was born in the Celestial King Graveyard, and because she was only at the Severing Mundane Tier, she was treated like mud in this place.

In Ling Han’s eyes, however, she was nothing more than an innocent person. Thus, he treated her with respect.

“What do you want to know?” Zhao Shuang asked, his voice becoming increasingly calm. However, only he knew just how violently his heart was beating.

After drinking a glass of wine, Ling Han stood up, and said, “There are too many people. All of you, enter.”

He reached out, grabbing a person and tossing them into his Spatial Celestial Tool.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. Li Long was finally revealing his murderous nature!

They needed to flee!

They screamed in fear as they rushed toward the exits. However, when they reached the door, they were horrified to discover that there was seemingly an invisible wall blocking their way. They couldn’t leave the hall no matter what.

‘What’s going on?!’

Why couldn’t they leave the hall? And why wasn’t the Seventh Heaven Celestial King coming to save them?

They were already screaming their lungs out! Were the people outside deaf?

Ling Han casually reached around, grabbing Celestial King after Celestial King and tossing them into his Spatial Celestial Tool after sealing their cultivation. After a dozen or so times, only the maidservants, dancers, and Zhao Shuang remained.

Zhao Shuang was collapsed on his chair. He wanted to move, but he was so petrified that he couldn’t even move a single finger.

Ling Han reached over again, sealing Zhao Shuang’s cultivation and tossing him into his Spatial Celestial Tool as well. He then turned to the maidservants and dancers with a smile, saying, “Sorry for frightening you all.” With a flash, he vanished without a trace.

“Aaah!” At this moment, piercing screams instantly cut through the entire Zhao residence.

Whoosh!

The Seventh Heaven Celestial King immediately dashed over. However, fury instantly spread across his face when he saw the scene before him. Terrifying killing intent coursed through his body.

***

Ling Han arrived at a hidden place in the city before entering his Spatial Celestial Tool, where he started to interrogate Zhao Shuang.

Zhao Shuang was trembling in fear, and no tears were forthcoming even though he wanted to bawl.

This was truly karma. He had still been wishing for Ling Han to kill more second-generation young masters so that he could become the one-and-only, and Ling Han had indeed snuck over again. However, Ling Han’s target was him.

If he had known this, he definitely wouldn’t have wished for such matters.

Ling Han patted Zhao Shuang’s shoulder, saying, “I have a few questions for you.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Brother Long, please ask away,” Zhao Shuang hurriedly said. As long as he could live, he wouldn’t mind abandoning his temperament as a second-generation young master. He was willing to become an obedient dog.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “How much do you know about Brahman Celestial Flowers?”

“Huh?” Zhao Shuang was astonished. He hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would actually ask about this.

“Huh what? Hurry up and answer me,” Ling Han said with a glare.

“The fruits of Brahman Celestial Flowers are the main ingredient for refining Ascending Dragon Pills. They’re incredibly valuable,” Zhao Shuang hurriedly replied.

‘This simple?’

“That’s all you know?” Ling Han said in disappointment.

Upon seeing the murderous glint in Ling Han’s eyes, Zhao Shuang’s heart involuntarily jolted. He hurriedly added, “Brother Long, I can bring you to where my father cultivates Brahman Celestial Flowers.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Perhaps you want the Celestial King guarding that place to kill me and then rescue you?”

Zhao Shuang had indeed been thinking about this. After all, Brahman Celestial Flowers were far too valuable. Thus, even though his father had gone off to war, he had still left a trustworthy and powerful subordinate to guard the herbal garden. He definitely couldn’t risk any accident.

However, upon hearing Ling Han’s words, he hurriedly shook his head. In fact, he shook his head so hard that it was as if he were about to shake it off his neck. “I wouldn’t dare to! How could this underling dare to have such thoughts? Brother Long, you’re overthinking things.”

Ling Han retrieved a pill, and tossed it to Zhao Shuang. “Swallow it.”

“Brother Long, what pill is this?” Zhao Shuang asked with a bitter expression.

“A poisonous pill, of course,” Ling Han answered calmly.

“Huh?” Zhao Shuang had already been about to swallow the pill. However, upon hearing Ling Han’s words, he immediately stopped his motion.

“This is a slow-acting poison,” Ling Han said. “Swallowing it won’t kill you right away. However, you’ll only have three days. Once three days pass, if you don’t get my antidote, you can only pray to the gods.”

Zhao Shuang was no fool. He naturally understood what Ling Han meant. If he dared to pull any tricks, perhaps Ling Han would be killed. However, Zhao Shuang would definitely be killed as well!

“I understand, I understand!”
