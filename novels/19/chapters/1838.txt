Chapter 1839: Where Do You Rank Among the Sea of Prodigies?

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. After a while, he finally said, “Abandoning their body thousands of times simply to reach a state of perfection in the Severing Mundane Tier?”

The large black dog nodded in confirmation. “Although the ultimate purpose of cultivation is to comprehend and grasp the great dao, 10,000 people crossing the same sea might yield 10,000 different methods. Cultivation is no different.

“You might be severing the same heaven and earth, yet the difference between you and someone else can still be unimaginably great.

“I’m aware of a freakish prodigy who severed a branch of the great dao each time he severed the mundane. After reaching the fifth severance, he would abandon his physical body and resurrect to sever more branches of the great dao. After reaching a point where he couldn’t sever any more branches of the great dao, he finally decided to advance to the Dividing Soul Tier.”

Ling Han was stunned upon hearing this. Just what kind of freak was this?

“Isn’t it often said that one’s original body is the best? Even if it’s not a Divine Fetus, isn’t it best for one to keep their original body?” Ling Han asked.

“That’s indeed the case,” the large black dog said with a nod. “However, if you become a Celestial King in the future, you’ll be able to perfectly fuse with your body even if it isn’t your original body. Anyhow, if you’re not confident in becoming a Celestial King, then what’s the purpose of going to so much trouble?!”

‘This... makes sense!’

Ling Han was delighted upon learning this, and he said, “After reaching the fifth severance, I’ll also abandon this body to cultivate for several more lifetimes.”

“Impossible!” the large black dog immediately refuted. “Firstly, your body has been tempered by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so it can’t be abandoned anyway. Even if your physical body is destroyed and you possess someone else, your dao will have been severed. At that time, you won’t be able to advance any further.

“You practice a different cultivation technique, and this has determined that you can’t follow the same path.

“Secondly, there’s not enough time for you. It’s integral that you reach a state of perfection with each mundane that you sever. Even if your severances aren’t as comprehensive as that freak’s, you can slowly make up for this in the future. In any case, the difference won’t be too great.

“The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll is the most powerful physique tempering cultivation technique in the entire world. By practicing it, you won’t be weaker than anyone else!”

Ling Han’s heart shuddered. The large black dog even knew about the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll? Just what kind of relationship did he have with the owner of the Tower of Three Realms?

“Who is that freakish prodigy? Where is he now?”

The large black dog glanced at Ling Han before calmly saying, “You’ve heard of him before.”

‘I’ve even heard of him before?’

“Who is he?”

“The Imperial Void Celestial King!” the large black dog said. He paused for a moment before continuing, “I’m fairly sure he was already at the eighth heaven back then. Moreover, he was only a single step from reaching the ninth heaven. Right now, it’s extremely likely that he’s already advanced to the ninth heaven.”

‘Gasp! A ninth heaven Celestial King!’

Ling Han recalled what Cheng Fu had told him. Back then, the Celestial King of the Cheng Clan had also been an incredibly freakish being. In the end, however, he had vanished after being defeated by a group of Celestial Kings. After that, the Imperial Void Celestial King had stepped forward and erased the entire Cheng Clan.

If the Imperial Void Celestial King had truly become a ninth heaven Celestial King, how would Ling Han exact revenge for the Cheng Clan?

“Is the Imperial Void Celestial King from the Sealed Emotion Palace—”

Ling Han was just about to ask a question, yet his mouth was quickly covered by the large black dog’s paw. He was stopped from continuing his question.

“Brat, if you don’t want to die, don’t casually throw these titles around. Once you mention them, you’ll trigger the detection of those old monsters. Regardless of where in the Celestial Realm you are, their divine sense will still possess the ability to instantly appear before you!” the large black dog exclaimed. His spittle sprayed all over Ling Han’s face.

In fact, Small Tower had also warned him about this before. The titles of some supreme beings couldn’t be casually mentioned.

‘Hang on... The Imperial Void Celestial King is already a ninth heaven Celestial King, yet the large black dog didn’t become so worked up when I mentioned his name. Why did he become so worked up when I mentioned the Sealed Emotion Palace? I can only assume that there’s an even more powerful individual in the Sealed Emotion Palace.

‘A paramount ruler among the ninth heaven Celestial Kings?’

Ling Han didn’t ask any more questions. Judging by the large black dog’s expression, it was as if he wanted to completely seal his mouth. As such, how could he continue to ask about this topic?

Small Tower had also mentioned this to him before. If he wanted to know about these matters, he would at least have to become a Celestial King.

There were nine heavens in the Celestial King Tier, and advancing to each subsequent level was as difficult as ascending the heavens!

The three of them ascended the volcano, and the large black dog continued to tell them about the Heavenly Fire Celestial King.

In the past, this place had indeed been a powerful sect. However, it was a shame that the Heavenly Fire Celestial King had passed away. The powerful sect disbanded after that, and all of its disciples left. This place then transformed into a burial ground for the Heavenly Fire Celestial King.

This was because the Heavenly Fire Celestial King still had a mission: he wanted to refine himself and return to a state of origin so that he could help someone in the future.

However, time was an eternal enemy, and the large black dog and the other friends of the Heavenly Fire Celestial King either died or became severely wounded. As time passed, no more powerful elites stood guard at this burial ground. It was also because of this that the Thundercloud Celestial King, Purple River Celestial King, and other Celestial Kings entered here and engaged in an earth-shattering battle to fight for Divine Metal.

However, none of them discovered the secret of the Heavenly Fire Celestial King. More precisely, even after their death, the arrangements of eighth heaven Celestial Kings weren’t something that measly first heaven Celestial Kings could discover and understand.

After learning this, Ling Han finally understood the history and origin of this mystery realm.

Anyhow, it wasn’t long before they reached the peak of the volcano. The large black dog told the Empress to stand in the distance, after which he started to chant at the crater of the volcano.

Weng!

A veined pattern lit up on the ground, stretching all the way from the crater to the foot of the volcano. A second veined pattern then lit up, followed by a third, a fourth... and all the way until the 108th.

Boom!

A brilliant radiance soared into the sky, and it was as if the entire volcano was about to fracture and collapse.

The volcano shuddered violently.

Peng, peng, peng!

Countless Blood Dragon Stones were spat out from the volcano at an even quicker rate. This was a truly magnificent sight.

Far away in the canyon, everyone was stunned upon seeing this.

Such an astonishing phenomenon had never occurred before.

‘Is this because of Ling Han?’

If it was because of him, that would be far too unfathomable. After all, even Immortal Palace Tier elites couldn’t enter that region. As a measly third severance cultivator, how could he trigger such an incredible commotion? However, if it wasn’t because of him, this kind of phenomenon had never occurred before, so why would it only occur after Ling Han entered that region?

Closer to the volcano, Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but retreat in disarray. The fire particles among heaven and earth had suddenly become wild and chaotic, so much so that she couldn’t withstand them even with her Flame Control Technique. She had no option but to retreat.

Fortunately, she had obtained an astonishing number of Blood Dragon Stones. As such, it wouldn’t matter even if she were forced to leave the mystery realm now. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom, boom, boom!

The volcano descended into chaos, throwing columns of scorching lava into the air. However, in an eerie sight, these columns of lava didn’t fall from the sky. Meanwhile, the 108 veined patterns glowed with an increasing brilliance as they seeped further and further into the ground.

The earth trembled, and the volcano surprisingly grew taller and taller. In an unfathomable turn of events, the volcano then started to hover in the air.

Ling Han and the Empress yelped in astonishment. This was because the volcano was only a small corner of a rising figure!

A colossal figure crawled up from the ground. This was a humanoid figure, and there was a single horn protruding from their forehead. Right now, boiling lava was still flowing from this horn. This was a colossal human who appeared as if they could connect heaven and earth. In fact, just their horn alone could already pierce through the clouds. As such, how tall would they be if they fully stood up?

The giant stood up, and he radiated with a domineering might as he peered down at the earth. His aura was surging, and those before him had no option but to prostrate themselves.

Eighth heaven Celestial King!

“Old friend, we finally meet again,” the large black dog said with emotion. “It sure was relaxing for you to leave first. You’ve left all of the troublesome matters to Grandpa Dog! However, who told Grandpa Dog to still be alive? I have to do what I have to do!

“Rest assured, I’ll definitely burn and offer Celestial King Ling Miao’s panties to you. Back then we couldn’t peep on Celestial Maiden Ling Miao bathing, so I can only offer her panties to you now. That will allow you to finally rest in peace.”

The large black dog continued to murmur, and it was all about his debauched adventures with the Heavenly Fire Celestial King. Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace as he listened on. He started to suspect that it was because of their incredible debauchery that they had been punished by the heavens.

“Brat, come here!” the large black dog suddenly shouted.
