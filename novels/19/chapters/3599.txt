Chapter 3600: Extreme Flame Valley

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Li Xingchen looked meaningfully at Ling Han before saying, “Your courage is truly commendable. However, gathering the Five Elements Crystals will take an incredibly long time. You had best prepare yourself mentally, and set a time limit. I’ve heard that there was once a prodigy who spent several hundred years to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill. When the pill was successfully concocted, he was also close to death. The pill instead benefited another.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Brother Li. I’ll remember it.”

Li Xingchen gave him a map. It was not made of paper, but rather was a Spirit Tool. With the injection of his Spiritual Power, he would enter into a three- dimensional space. There would be mountains, rivers, and seas, realistic and life-like.

“I’ll give it to you. It’s not worth much anyways,” he said.

Was this a mockery of Ling Han’s stinginess?

Ling Han was very shameless, and pretended that he had not heard anything. Who asked that he was indeed poor now, and his cultivation level was also low? What could he offer to compensate the other?

—There was, but that was too precious.

“Brother Li, I owe you a favor,” Ling Han said seriously. He wouldn’t just come once, but the second time he came to the Moonlight Planet, he must have already stepped onto the Celestial Path, or even Cauldron Forging Tier, or Core Formation Tier.

Li Xingchen waved his hand, and said, “Don’t. I’ve gifted you this map to sever the karma between us. From now onwards, you can pretend that you’ve never seen me before. I’m afraid that you’ll hit me again!”

With that said, he leaped up and fled.

Ling Han glanced at the little loli, and the little loli also looked back at him. The two of them pointed at each other at the same time, and said, “It’s all your fault. You scared him off.”

After saying this, the two of them laughed loudly. Ling Han was shameless, and this little girl was definitely thick-skinned as well.

Ling Han released the seven babies, and the nine of them followed the map. They had landed at a very coincidental location, only a mere two days’ journey away from the place where the power of the Five Elements was the densest — this naturally was calculated based on Ling Han’s speed.

That was a valley that was burning with flames, and was called the Extreme Flame Valley.

In the Extreme Flame Valley, there were a great many fiery creatures formed from the essence of fire. They were born in the Extreme Flame Valley, and were also bound here, unable to leave forever.

Two days later, the nine of them arrived at their destination.

“What a powerful suppression from heaven and earth.” The little loli immediately called out, “I can’t even use my Spirit Tool anymore!”

“This place can only unleash power on the level of the mortal plane.” Second Baby used her ocular technique to observe, “The great power of heaven and earth is suppressing it, forming a natural formation… yi, that’s not definite. It’s possible that it’s man-made, but it must be created by a Formation Grandmaster.”

Ling Han nodded. It was also because of this that the Five Elements Crystals had become so valuable. This was because no matter how high one’s cultivation level was, one could only unleash battle prowess of Mystery Realm Tier when they came here. They wouldn’t be able to increase their efficiency at all.

Of course, perhaps Saints and Ancestral Kings could ignore the suppression of heaven and earth if they came, but what Saint or Ancestral King would do such a thing?

Moreover, how many Saints were there in this world?

As for Ancestral Kings? That was an invincible great emperor that could only appear once in an era, so it was even more impossible.

“That’s good too. Then I won’t have to worry about anyone harming me in the valley,” he said with a smile.

“Let’s beat them up!”

“Rob them!”

The little loli and the seven toddlers all raised their arms and cheered, appearing to be extremely excited.

Ling Han placed his hand on his forehead. Was it really right to bring them out?

They continued to advance. The heaven and earth’s suppression became more and more powerful, and they kept feeling as if there were invisible shackles weighing down on them. However, they didn’t experience any substantial change.

This was because only elites above Celestial Path would truly be restricted. They were too weak, and could ignore it even if they were restricted.

The Extreme Flame Valley was very large, and one could see the scorched earth all around them before even walking into the valley. It was mainly black in colour, but red flames could be seen flickering from time to time.

A person appeared ahead of them. He stumbled over, and when he saw Ling Han and his group, he looked pleasantly surprised. He stretched out his hand and said, “Water, water, I want water!”

Ling Han’s eyes swept over him, and couldn’t help but feel stunned. This person was really too skinny, as if he was skin and bones, his eyes almost popping out of his head.

He took out the water sack and handed it over. After the man took it, he hurriedly drank. The sack of water was quickly emptied, and the effects were immediately apparent. His shrivelled face was flushed and full.

But a strange thing also happened. There was steam rising from his body, and very soon, that face shriveled up again, as if the moisture had completely evaporated.

“Water, I want more water!” That person shouted at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. This was obviously useless. There should be powerful flames burning inside this person’s body. No matter how much water he drank, it would only evaporate, and would not solve the problem at all.

“I said, give me water!” the person roared, his eyes baleful and menacing, filled with killing intent.

Boom!

He pounced out, throwing a punch at Ling Han.

Ling Han casually shook his hand, and that person was sent backwards.

Beneath the Celestial Path, how many people were still his match?

“Ah—” That person released a terrible scream. Boom, his whole person had turned into a ball of raging flames, burning fiercely, and very soon, he had been burnt into charcoal.

“Ling Han, he only asked for some water from you. Even if you don’t want to give it to him, you don’t have to burn him to death, right?” The little loli shook her head, then said after some thought, “Killing and burning, killing and burning, so that means burning someone to death.”

Ling Han’s expression darkened, and he said, “I wasn’t the one who killed him. Moreover, I didn’t set him on fire either.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The little girl rolled her eyes at him, “Hehe, I’ll just believe that he self-combusted.”

Second Baby looked at it with an eye technique, and said, “There’s a powerful fire essence in this person’s body, and it couldn’t be suppressed just now. It exploded from the inside out, instantly burning him to death.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Look, this is what professionalism is. Learn from her.”

Second Baby giggled, “Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that Father had made a move.”

F***, this bunch of brats.

“Looks like this Extreme Flame Valley is really a very dangerous place,” Ling Han said. “That person should have been collecting fire essence in the valley, but after a long battle, his body was also slowly corroded by the fire poison, and in the end, he burned himself to death.”

“I’m not afraid,” Fourth Baby said. “This place is really comfortable.”

“I hate it.” Fifth Baby’s expression was filled with disgust.

One of them was of the element of fire, while the other was of the element of water. They just happened to have two completely different feelings about this place.

“Let’s go. The sooner we finish, the sooner we can pack up.”

Ling Han brought the babies and the little loli into the valley. Instantly, he saw multiple flaming creatures roaming around in the valley. Some were in the form of beasts, like goats, tigers, panthers, some were in the form of humans, and some were in the form of birds, but they could only glide a certain distance in the air.

These flaming creatures seemed to have a fixed area of activity, and would not cross over the border. Thus, even if Ling Han and his group appeared, not a single flaming creature attacked them.

Right until Ling Han took a few more steps forwards, and saw a flaming tiger suddenly pounce towards him.

Peng, Ling Han destroyed it with a single punch, and a spark instantly appeared on the ground.
