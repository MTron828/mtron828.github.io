Chapter 2215: A special Mystery Realm

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Past, present, and future are Eternity, while Everlasting is superior to Yin and Yang,” Small Tower said calmly. “Refining the 11 Mystery Realms with Regulations of Time can allow transcendence of past and present and linking to the future.”

Ling Han sighed. “I don’t know the details, but this is very awesome in short, right?”

“Of course!” Small Tower declared proudly.

“Can Hu Niu and the others also construct 11 Mystery Realms?” Ling Han asked again.

“Yes, there is no rule that says a Fourth Severance cannot attain Dividing Nine Souls. However, without even attaining the Fifth Severance, wanting to attain Dividing Nine Souls would naturally be as difficult as ascending to the heavens,” Small Tower said. There wasn’t the slightest change in its tone, and this was also the reason why Ling Han was unwilling to bicker with it. It was basically a dead person, so it wouldn’t get angry at all.

“Then, would there still be hopes of becoming a Heavenly Venerate?” Ling Han asked hopefully.

Small Tower scoffed, and said, “Even if you can cultivate the Fifth Severance, Dividing Nine Souls, and 11 Mystery Realms to the pinnacle, whether you can or cannot become a Heavenly Venerate will still depend on luck! Throughout the ages, there have been innumerable prodigies. Do you think that there were few people like you—there were indeed very few, but at least one would appear every epoch. Yet how many of them had actually successfully become Heavenly Venerates?”

Ling Han nodded. In this heaven and earth, even if there would be miracles due to the invasion of the Foreign Realm and rise of new prodigies, this number should only be one.

Throughout history, there has never been a previous case of two Heavenly Venerates emerging in a single epoch. In fact, after a Heavenly Venerate came to being, the next Heavenly Venerate would only emerge after at least 10 epochs.

“Then, after leaping out of this heaven and earth, perhaps Luan Xing and Hu Niu may also be able to become Heavenly Venerates,” Ling Han murmured to himself. Otherwise, even if they cultivated both Dividing Nine Souls and 11 Mystery Realms, it would still be useless.

Perhaps, the cultivation surroundings of the Foreign Realm were more exceptional, and did not have such harsh demands that one had to be fully equipped with the Fifth Severance, Dividing Nine Souls, and 11 Mystery Realms to be able to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“This is a dangerous thought,” Small Tower said solemnly. “Though the Tower of Three Realms is a Heavenly Venerable Tier treasure that has surpassed Regulations, it was still forged in this heaven and earth, and only would it be effective in this heaven and earth.

“In the simplest example, your present 10,000x acceleration effects would not be effective in the Foreign Realm.”

Very simple, a different heaven and earth meant different Regulations.

“For the sake of strength, I have to make an attempt.” Ling Han’s stand was very firm. Though the heaven and earth had broken their own rules, and allowed the Dragon’s Gate Mountain to descend ahead of time, the existence of Heavenly Venerable Tier was unrecognized by the heaven and earth. If there was a gap, it should be impossible to advance into this cultivation level.

“All right, let’s just set this aside first. At present, the priority is to break through to the Immortal Palace Tier.”

Ling Han went out, and made some inquiries to find out which Mystery Realm would allow him to use the Regulations of Time to construct the Mystery Realms of the Immortal Palace Tier.

However, progress was extraordinarily rough. If he wanted to construct the Mystery Realm with Regulations of Fire, he could go to the Burning Mountain, Demonic Flames Valley, and the like. If he wanted to break through with Regulations of Lightning, he could go to the Divine Lightning Lake, Mad Clouds Swamp, and so on.

But the Regulations of Time were the strongest Regulations in the world, and could be invincible before Celestial King Tier. It was not a problem of having few of this kind of Mystery Realm, but rather they did not exist at all.

“How stupid. Since I said that the Mystery Realms should be formed through the Regulations of Time, I naturally know this place, and you actually do not ask me. How dumb,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up after Ling Han’s multiple failed inquiries.

Ling Han couldn’t help but curse, and exclaimed, “Would you have died if you had spoken earlier? Furthermore, since you said I should break through with the Regulations of Time, why did you not tell me the location at the same time?”

“What would be about that then, right?” Small Tower countered very shamelessly.

“All right. I won’t drop myself to your level. Now tell me, where is that Mystery Realm?” Ling Han asked.

“Under normal circumstances, you would never be able to find it for your whole life,” Small Tower said. “Time is the most mysterious Regulation, and the heaven and earth would not permit anyone to touch it. Only Celestial medicines can draw on this Regulations, and be ingested by humans for comprehension.”

“…Then how can I enter into abnormal circumstances?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“You would need to concoct an alchemical pill that allows your soul to transmigrate through time, and only then would you be able to enter into that Mystery Realm,” Small Tower replied.

Ling Han was curious, and asked, “It would be my spirit entering, but I am supposed to form my Mystery Realm inside my body. Would that be of any use?”

“Of course!” Small Tower scoffed, appearing disdainful. “What you need is only the Regulations, and Regulations are formless. What does it have to do with your physical body?”

There was such a way too?

“Then what is the alchemical pill?” Ling Han asked.

“You are not qualified to concoct it yet, because that needs an Eighth Refinement,” Small Tower replied.

Eighth Refinement!

Ninth Refinement was the limit of Spirit Refinement, and only a Five-Star Grandmaster could achieve that, and this alchemical pill actually needed Eighth Refinement to be effective. The requirements could be considered extraordinarily high.

“I am presently at Seventh Refinement, and Eighth Refinement… How long would that take?” Ling Han couldn’t be sure, either. Grandmaster Zi Cheng could also be considered an extraordinary prodigy of alchemy, but even over tens of billions of years, he still had not attained Eighth Refinement.

“Then, I will try to achieve Eighth Refinement first!”

Ling Han entered into the Black Tower, and began burying himself in alchemy. In any case, there was a channel of business for all the alchemical pills he produced, so he could get new medicinal ingredients for another round of concoction, forming a positive cycle.

It could not be denied that Liu Jun, having been accepted as a disciple in the Saintly Origin Academy, was indeed quite strong in alchemy.

At least, in the concoction of Three-Star alchemical pills, his success rate was as high as 50%, and that was with the basis of Fourth Refinement, which was extremely shocking.

However, because of this, he had received a lot of criticism from Ling Han.

“Too stupid. Only a 50% success rate, you wasteful idiot!” Ling Han couldn’t help but kick him a few times again. “Look here, the Water and Moon Pill is concocted like this.”

Liu Jun was naturally defiant. He was indeed no match for Ling Han in battle, but in terms of alchemy, Ling Han was far from being a match for him, either!

And he actually said that his 50% success rate was too low?

F***, if even that was considered wasteful, what wouldn’t be considered wasteful?

50% success rate, added with Fourth Refinement, what did that signify?

WIth the money for one portion of ingredients, he could earn 30 times the profit!

But as he saw how Ling Han proficiently started the fire and opened the cauldron, Liu Jun was immediately stunned.

This bringer of calamity was actually an alchemist as well? F***!

The more he watched, the more shocked he was. That was because Ling Han was actually really concocting the Water and Moon Pill. This was a Three-Star alchemical pill.

These movements… Too proficient, too amazing; even he could not help but want to imitate his movements.

Time passed unknowingly, and Ling Han smacked the cauldron. The pill had actually been completed.

Only then did realization dawn on Liu Jun. As it turned out, he had been staring at Ling Han concocting an alchemical pill, and as long as three months had passed without his awareness.

Just how focused had he been that he would overlook such a long time having passed?

“Perfection level!” He also forgot whether he would be hit by Ling Han again. He ran over to check on the alchemical pill that had been concocted, and was stunned yet again, looking at Ling Han with a practically reverent gaze.

‘You are too f***** awesome, aren’t you?’

Ling Han gave him another kick. “Don’t be a hindrance here.” He then began Spirit Refinement.

First Refinement, Second Refinement, Third Refinement… Seventh Refinement!

Liu Jun’s eyes were wide and bulging. This scene was really too full of impact.

Seventh Refinement, he actually could achieve Seventh Refinement.

When he knew Ling Han was a Three-Star Alchemist, he was already numb with shock, but Ling Han could actually achieve Seventh Refinement. What did that mean?

He was a Four-Star Grandmaster!

Brother!
