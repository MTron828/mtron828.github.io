The moment the defensive formation technique broke, the totem naturally sent out a warning to those in the Imperial Palace at the first opportunity.

Hence, Feng Po Yun, the Rain Emperor, Murong Qing, Helian Tianyun, and the others all rushed out, and added with a large number of soldiers, they surrounded the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

Was this bullying them just because they were a nation without a monarch? They actually dared mock them like this!

“Humph, allow me to crush this wretched vessel!” Helian Tianyun had a fiery temper. Though he looked to be less than 10 years old, the air he exuded was shockingly at the Immortal level. He punched out, and it transformed into a roaring black dragon that shot out towards the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

“Awoo...” A gigantic Demonic Beast appeared, and with a claw of its paw, the black dragon was shattered. It went incredibly easy. “Hahahaha, I, the Asura Demon Emperor, have once again returned!”

‘What!?’

Helian Tianyun and the others were all astonished. They naturally knew who the Asura Demon Emperor was. Not long before Ma Duo Bao had opened the sky, he had even come here with the people of the five sects to attempt to kill Ling Han so he could snatch away the latter’s fated opportunity.

Hadn’t this guy been subdued by Ling Han? Why had he now appeared here again? Furthermore, he had become so powerful that he could easily disperse even an attack from Helian Tianyun!

It had to be known that though Helian Tianyun had just broken through to the Immortal level, he had cultivated up to the Shattering Void Tier in two lifetimes. When Ling Han opened the skies, his power had reached 14 stars, and after opening the sky, as a subject of the Great Ling Empire, he had also been rewarded by the heaven and earth. Though his good fortune was not as much as Ling Han’s, he had still been given a boost of an additional two stars.

In strength alone, he had already reached 16 stars. That kind of foundation was too deep and resounding, so the moment he advanced into the Mountain River Tier, his battle prowess would be able to exceed four stars, which was incredibly frightening.

Yet the Asura Demon Emperor managed to easily disperse a full-power attack from him; then, how powerful had this demon become?

More importantly, since he appeared, then what about Ling Han? Could it be that he had been murdered?

Pa!

Just at this moment, a tall, slender figure appeared. He raised a hand and gave a sharp knock on the head of the Demon Wolf. “What are you strutting around for?”

“Hehe, this Little Asura has returned to our homeland, and so had gotten a bit carried away. Please forgive me, Master!” The Demon Wolf that had been so majestic moments ago abruptly became an obedient puppy, waving that huge tail of his madly, “pander” written all over his face.

F***, he had really changed faces too fast, hadn’t he!

“Fourth Brother!”

“Your Majesty!”

“Master!”

“Young Master Ling!”

“Ling Han!”

Feng Po Yun, Ding Ping, Can Ye, and the seven Kings as well as the various guardians all exclaimed in surprise. As it turned out, Ling Han had returned!

“Big Brother! Second Brother! Third Brother!” Ling Han quickly ran over, and embraced Feng Po Yun and the others.

Even though this group of men would not shed tears easily, they could not help but break out in tears now. Yet, at the same time, they were laughing loudly, which caused Shui Yanyu, who had followed outside, to look out curiously because she had never seen this face of Ling Han.

This was the real Ling Han, wasn’t he? In the Imperial Capital, where he was unfamiliar and all alone, he had been wearing a mask, and closed off his heart. He had only let go of his facade at this moment, and showed his truest face here.

She looked on gladly. The more pleased this man was, the happier she was as well.

“This is...” Everyone had spotted Shui Yanyu, and had also sensed the powerful air she was exuding. That was a suppression from a superior level, a limitation that no genius could possibly step over.

She was just like Helian Tianyun, at the Immortal level!

“Oh, she is my wife, Shui Yanyu,” Ling Han introduced, smiling.

Shui Yanyu was both embarrassed and pleased. However, there were too many people here, so she was too embarrassed to pinch Ling Han. She merely gave a slight bow, and said, “Yanyu meets Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother!” Just now, she had watched Ling Han call out to Feng Po Yun and the others, so she was naturally aware that these three men were Ling Han’s sworn brothers.

“Yi, then what about me?” Helian Tianyun was displeased now. ‘I am f****** in the ancestor’s rank, so why has she not greeted me?’

“Don’t mind him, he’s just a shameless old man pretending to be young.” Ling Han shoved Helian Tianyun aside, causing the latter to yell out in anger. Ordinarily speaking, Ling Han should also call him an ancestor. ‘Damn it, damn it!’

“Madam!” Ding Ping called out loudly, slightly hesitant to look upon such a beautiful madam.

Ling Han swept an eye over him, and said, “Not bad. I have just left for over a year, and you have already cultivated until the Spiritual Infant Tier! This time, I will give you private lessons again, allowing you to advance into the Immortal level before I leave!”

“Fourth Brother, are you leaving again?” Feng Po Yun muttered.

Ling Han broke into a smile, and said, “This time, not only I will leave. You all leave with me, Brothers. I have already established some foundation in the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, and I presently need you all to lend me a helping hand, Brothers!”

Feng Po Yun and the others were greatly pleased. They were all proud and powerful figures in their own right, each one of them an incredible genius. How rare was it for someone to be able to cultivate all the way up to the Shattering Void Tier in a small world? They, too, longed to make their way in the Immortal Realm. It was only because Ling Han had been taken away as a hostage that they had to protect the Great Ling Empire on his behalf.

Now that Ling Han had established some foundation, they were naturally pleasantly surprised.

“Fourth Brother, you are really incredible. I thought that I would have to stay here for more than a century to be able to see you again.” The Rain Emperor laughed. This was not an overboard compliment. It had to be known that appearing in the kind of place that the Immortal Realm was, it was a given that Ling Han would have to start over from zero.

Only Shui Yanyu was the clearest about the amazing accomplishments that Ling Han had made in this last year or so. The fact caused her heart to ripple and her eyes to become tender.

“Come, come, come. Fourth Brother, tell us what you have gone through in the last year!” Murong Qing pulled on Ling Han. “Oh, right. What cultivation level are you in now?”

This attracted everyone’s curiosity. After all, the most crucial thing for cultivators was still cultivation level.

Everyone here was his trusted comrade, so there was nothing that Ling Han felt the need to hide. Hence, he replied, “The peak stage of the medium extreme.”

Pu!

Helian Tianyun abruptly choked. Only he had advanced into Immortal level in this place, so he was naturally aware how difficult it was to advance in the Mountain River Tier. Putting aside the peak stage of medium extreme, even if Ling Han was only in the peak stage of the low extreme, it would have been inconceivable!

It should be known that even he was only in the early stage of low extreme, and there was practically not even a sliver of improvement since he broke through.

There was nothing that could be done. His cultivation resources could not catch up. In this place, how would he have been able to obtain True Origin Stones or various Immortal level Divine Pills?

“You brat are a freak, you have always been,” he exclaimed. Just imagine, the fact he had lived two lives was already awesome enough, yet he was still no match for Ling Han.

Shui Yanyu, though, was surprised. She naturally knew that Ling Han had come by opening the sky, and she had also heard Ling Han speak of the origins of those close to him, so she knew that these people did not have Immortal level background.

But even with that, Helian Tianyun still managed to advance into the Mountain River Tier. This was too inconceivable. If she told this to others, probably no one would believe her.

For them to be able to come by opening the sky in a small world, there were truly a number of super geniuses gathered here!

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Come, let’s speak as we walk.”

The four brothers, along with Helian Tianyun and Ding Ping, were those closest to Ling Han. As they drank wine, they heard Ling Han talk about his experiences in the last year and so. They all felt overwhelmed by emotions, wanting nothing more than to immediately charge out into this boundless Immortal Realm themselves to make their way in this world and have their own adventures.

When Ling Han had finished his account, Feng Po Yun and the others also talked about the recent situation in the Great Ling Empire. Restlessness was secretly brewing!
