3113 The Little Maid Shows Her Might

Everyone exclaimed in surprise.

Who would have thought that a maid would suddenly move, and even manage to block Zhang Baichuan’s fist?

Unbelievable, this was really unbelievable.

Naturally, there were people who recognized Zhang Baichuan, and knew that he was a Two Meridians cultivator. Even if they didn’t recognize him, once they saw him attack, they would be able to roughly determine his cultivation level.

Even if they couldn’t distinguish anything, as long as they knew that Zhang Baichuan was a sect disciple, they would know that it meant that he had opened up his meridians and possessed extraordinary strength.

How could his attack be blocked by a maid?

Could it be that this maid was also a cultivator?

Judging from her slender figure, she was definitely not the type with astonishing brute force. It could only be said that she had cultivated “mystical power,” and could stand against Zhang Baichuan.

No wonder Ling Han’s attitude was so proud. He didn’t even bother to duel with Zhang Baichuan. Just look, the latter couldn’t even deal with Ling Han’s maid.

On second thought, this maid was a cultivator, so her status was naturally much higher than “Xiaomei.” How could Zhang Baichuan and Xiaomei be allowed to insult her?

The status of a cultivator surpassed ordinary people, so they naturally couldn’t be disrespected.

Huan Xue’s heart was currently beating rapidly. She hadn’t thought much about it just now, but when she saw Zhang Baichuan “launch a sneak attack” at Ling Han, she was afraid that Ling Han would be injured, so she couldn’t help but jump out.

It wasn’t until this punch had been delivered that she realized what she had done. Nervousness and excitement filled her heart, making her tremble slightly.

However, it was only for a moment before she made up her mind.

There was no need for Ling Han to make a move at all. This kind of trash would dirty Young Master’s hands, and she could settle it instead.

Zhang Baichuan’s mouth also widened in disbelief.

This woman was a cultivator?

This maid?

F*ck! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Was it so fun to pretend to be a maid to fool others?

Otherwise, if he had known that Huan Xue was a cultivator, how could he have possibly mocked her?

He did not reflect on his actions at all. He felt that it was all Ling Han and Huan Xue’s fault. They were playing the pig to eat the tiger, deliberately messing with him.

“Ha!” He roared and charged forward.

Huan Xue also shouted and charged forward fearlessly.

Peng, peng, peng. The two of them exchanged blows. In just a few moves, Huan Xue’s position became very passive.

It couldn’t be helped. She had just begun cultivating, so she didn’t have any actual combat experience. She had already forgotten the moves she had learned in the battle, and only knew how to swing her fists.

This naturally meant that she was full of flaws, and it consumed a lot of her stamina.

Ling Han opened his mouth, and said, “Just treat it as a normal practice of fist techniques. What’s there to care about this kind of trash?”

When Huan Xue heard this, she instantly calmed down. In her heart, Ling Han was a god.

Since her god said that the person in front of her was just trash, what was there to be nervous about?

Her punches immediately followed the normal practice, and there were no more obvious flaws.

Zhang Baichuan was furious. He had actually been called trash by Ling Han. He really wanted to deal deftly with Huan Xue immediately, but he realized that this was just a wonderful idea.

Once Huan Xue calmed down, her attack power was actually quite terrifying.

Although she was a woman, her willpower was incomparable. She was not afraid of clashing with Zhang Baichuan at all. Even when her fingers were broken, she acted as if it was not her fingers that had been broken.

However, Zhang Baichuan was not so ruthless to himself. As the injuries on his body increased, he finally could not take it anymore. He hurriedly jumped out of the range of the battle, and wanted to stop.

However, Huan Xue didn’t agree. ‘You dared to sneak-attack my young master, so how could you get away so easily?’

She chased after him, her fists swinging nonstop.

Zhang Baichuan could only run, not daring to face her head-on.

Seeing this scene, everyone sighed with emotion.

“That person is Ling Han, right?” Someone recognized Ling Han. After all, when Ling Han had “appeared” back then, many people had gone to see him. This person had jumped out from the Divine Stone, so who wouldn’t be curious about him?

“Yes, that’s him.”

“It’s only been a month, but he already seems very impressive.”

“It can’t be helped. Don’t you know that Lord Sect Master gave him a Meridian Guiding Fruit?”

“It’s two Meridian Guiding Fruits, okay?”

“Pei, it’s three.”

“No wonder he could fight Zhang Baichuan. So he has advanced to Two Meridians.”

“En, as long as one can sense his meridians, one month is enough time for him to advance into Two Meridians.”

“Comparisons are really infuriating. I only get one Meridian Guiding Fruit every four to five years.”

“Furthermore, Lord Sect Master actually sent a disciple of Two Meridians to be Ling Han’s maid?”

“What favoritism!”

Everyone sighed with emotion. They naturally did not believe that Huan Xue was a maidservant, but rather that she was some junior sister of the sect that had been sent to protect Ling Han.

“Huan Xue, come back,” Ling Han said. There was really no need to waste time on a nobody like Zhang Baichuan.

Huan Xue immediately stopped and retreated to Ling Han’s side.

“Stretch out your hands,” Ling Han said.

Huan Xue stretched out her hands, and three of her ten fingers were dislocated.

Ling Han pressed her fingers back into position one by one, and cracking sounds rang out.

Huan Xue gritted her teeth, and didn’t say a word. She only broke out in cold sweat from the pain.

Fortunately, they were only dislocated, and everything would be fine once they were pushed back into place.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han strode forward, and Huan Xue hurriedly followed.

Seeing the two of them disappear around the corner, everyone looked at each other, their hearts palpitating in shock.

“However, Ling Han’s cultivation time is too short. At most, he’s only a Three Meridians. That is completely insufficient in the sect.”

“I heard that a few veteran senior brothers and senior sisters want to mess with him this time. He will definitely suffer today.”

“Hehe, let’s just wait and see the show.”

Everyone followed him in. As for Zhang Baichuan and Xiaomei?

No one cared.

This world never sympathized with losers. The victors would take away all attention, and the losers could only lick their own wounds.

Ling Han entered the main hall, and saw that it was truly magnificent.

From the outside, it looked like an ancient building, but the interior was extremely modern. It was the same style as before the great change that had happened more than 100 years ago. The marble floor tiles were covered with thick carpets, and there was no sound at all when one stepped on them.

Oil paintings hung all around on the walls. Most of them were probably fakes because most of the real ones had probably been destroyed in the chaotic era of the past.

Unusually, there was a huge photo hanging in the middle of one wall. It was of a young girl. She was quite good-looking, and exuded an incomparably arrogant aura.

This was the main lead of today, He Miaoyin.

It seemed that this girl was quite narcissistic.

The hall was filled with youngsters holding tall wine glasses in their hands and walking back and forth. There were also attendants shuttling through the crowd, holding trays filled with wine glasses in their hands. The guests could take a glass as they walked past.

There was music playing, but no musicians could be seen. It was something called a music player. It could store sound and play it at any time. Of course, there was a prerequisite for this—electricity.

“Junior Brother Ling!” Li Changdan appeared. He was tall and slender, and his temperament was outstanding. It was as if he had a halo above his head. No matter where he stood, he was incomparably dazzling, and attracted the attention of countless people.

His eyes were sharp, so he quickly spotted Ling Han, and strode over.

Like a cluster of stars surrounding the moon, Li Changdan was surrounded by everyone, completely suppressing Ling Han in bearing.
