Chapter 1095: Stone Statue Army

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu walked for a while, and after making sure that there was no one nearby, Ling Han waved his hand and let the Rain Emperor and others out of the Black Tower.

However, he didn’t let everyone out. Can Ye, Zhu Wu Jiu, and his other followers remained in the Black Tower to cultivate. Their cultivation level was still too low, so there would be no benefits even if they came out. Thus, it was naturally better for them to place their focus on cultivation.

Only five people left the Black Tower⁠—Feng Po Yun, the Rain Emperor, Mu Rong Qing, Helian Tianyun, and Ding Ping. The Asura Demon Emperor was in the body of a puppet wolf right now, so he couldn’t be counted as a person. Anyhow, he was a being from the Netherworld to begin with, so he had never been a human anyway.

“So, this is the large tomb among the stars?” The Rain Emperor and the others were all astounded. This place was completely different from their imagination, and seemed almost no different from the Joint Peace Planet. It was just that the Spiritual Qi here was thinner, though the life essence here was astonishingly abundant.

“Mm-hmm!” Ling Han nodded, and said, “This is the interior of the large tomb. Its size is indeed incredible.”

“Hehe, since we’ve arrived here, how about we each go our own way!” There was a glimmer in the Rain Emperor’s eyes, and there was a strong fighting spirit exuding from his body.

“Mm-hm!” Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing both nodded in agreement.

“I say we travel together. That way, it’s easier for us to look out for each other!” Ling Han felt that this place was dangerous, and there were also far too many elites present. The Rain Emperor and the others had broken through to the Immortal level, and they also possessed the ability to fight above their cultivation level. However, there was still a great number of people who could easily defeat or suppress them.

“Fourth Brother, we’re all more inclined toward nurturing ourselves through battle,” Feng Po Yun said with a smile. “Cultivating in seclusion isn’t the right path for us!”

Ling Han faltered for a moment, and then slowly nodded.

His three brothers were all supreme prodigies, especially the Rain Emperor, who had once been a ruler. How could such people stay under the wings of others? They were all proud people, so they naturally had to walk their own path.

“Fine. When the time comes, we’ll meet up at the exit.” Ling Han wasn’t a hesitant person, either.

“Fourth Brother, take care!” Feng Po Yun and the others said. They all headed off in their own directions.

“Huh? They’ve all run away that quickly?” Helian Tianyun scratched his head, and said, “Since they’ve all gone, I won’t stay here to ride your coattail, either. Little Ling, till later.”

He also left in a different direction.

“Master...” Ding Ping was also itching to head off on his own.

Ling Han couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “You... break through to the Immortal level first. When you succeed, I’ll also allow you to train outside by yourself. Now, however, you can remain honest and stay by my side.”

“Understood!” Ding Ping instantly conceded.

The three of them also chose a direction. This was an expanse of plains, and there wasn’t a single notable landmark in the surroundings to help one discern their bearings. Thus, their aim was merely not to retrace their own path.

This place was desolate, and there was no life on the plains. There were no rodents or rabbits, and there wasn’t even grass or other plants. It appeared as if this was a barren land.

This was especially strange. There was no Spiritual Qi here, but ordinary beings didn’t need Spiritual Qi, no? In any case, the life essence here was shockingly abundant, so shouldn’t this place have been thick with greenery and filled with animals? Why was it a desolate expanse of barren land?

They continued forward for almost a day.

“Huh?”

Ling Han was the first to cry out in surprise. There was a sea of people before them, and it looked as if they were an army standing in formation. Just one row of the formation already had a few thousand people. If he cast his eyes over a few more rows, the amount of people would number in tens of thousands.

“Master, what’s wrong?” Ding Ping asked hurriedly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han activated his Eye of Truth, and the look of astonishment on his face became even more intense. This was because the sea of people before them actually wasn’t consisting of people, but stone statues!

“Let’s move faster!” he shouted.

“Ok!” Ding Ping hurriedly nodded. However, he was only at the Shattering Void Tier, so how could his speed compare to Ling Han’s and Shui Yanyu’s? He was instantly kicked in the rear by an impatient Ling Han.

Xiu!

He flew toward the stone statues.

“Master...!” he wailed in anguish.

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at Ling Han. If others had such a talented disciple, they would definitely treat him like a treasure. However, Ling Han was completely different, and he was always thinking of ways to torment his disciple. Anyhow, the speed of Ding Ping’s cultivation was clear for all to see, and if Shui Yanyu didn’t work harder, it was extremely likely that she would be surpassed by him.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and he grabbed onto Shui Yanyu as he said, “Disciple, your master is merely testing your reaction speed. However, your performance has disappointed me greatly!”

Peng!

Ding Ping fell headfirst into the ground, directly getting stuck in it. He pulled his head out, only to find that he had already landed before the large army. This gave him a fright, and he hurriedly put on a cautious expression. Only after a short while did he realize that these were actually just stone statues.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and Shui Yanyu had already arrived. The Asura Demon Emperor followed closely behind them.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the army, and said in surprise, “There are at least 1,000,000 stone statues in this stone statue formation!”

“Are these grave goods 1 ?” Shui Yanyu asked curiously. Although this formation of 1,000,000 stone statues was astonishing, the great elite who was buried here was at least at the Eternal River Tier. That being the case, this formation of 1,000,000 stone statues appeared ordinary in comparison.

“Probably. There are 1,000,000 people to accompany him, so he won’t be lonely in the afterlife.” Ling Han shook his head, and continued, “Alas, even invincible elites can’t escape death. Is there truly no one who can remain undying for all eternity?”

Although the lifespan of Genesis Tier cultivators was incredibly long, there was still a limit, after all. They could only live for a maximum of four billion years.

This was a terrifyingly large number, yet it was nothing compared to eternity. There would eventually come a day where everything was laid to rest.

“Huh? There’s a stone tablet here.” They walked left for a while, only to find a stone tablet that measured nine meters tall standing before the stone statue formation. There were words engraved on the stone tablet. These were not blurry, unlike the ones at the main entrance. Instead, they were crisp and clear.

“Those who believe they are invincible can challenge this formation!” Ling Han read.

“Should we walk around or challenge the formation?” Shui Yanyu asked. Heavens knew what this stone statue formation was. It was best not to put themselves in danger.

Ling Han was just about to speak, yet he suddenly faltered, saying, “There’s movement ahead!”

They all leaped up, only to see a group of people entering the stone statue formation from 300 meters to their left. Meanwhile, the stone statues that had been rigid and unmoving surprisingly started to move, launching attacks toward that group of people.

Right now, those people were engaged in an intense battle.

“Puppets!” Ling Han and Shui Yanyu cried in unison. They were quite familiar with these kinds of beings now.

However, there had only been thousands of puppets on Earth’s Core Island, most of which were only at the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier. Meanwhile, the puppets here were all at the early stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. They possessed a frightening battle prowess.

The strength of the challengers wasn’t great, and they were kicked out of the formation after a short while. They were all bruised and bloodied, with wounds covering their entire bodies.

“Let’s walk around,” a person said. This suggestion was quickly accepted by the others, and they all started to walk around the stone statues. The stone statue formation was only around one kilometer wide, yet it was incredibly deep. Thus, it was entirely possible that the number of stone statues numbered over millions.

The group of people involuntarily stole a few extra glances at Shui Yanyu when they passed by. It seemed like some of them wanted to cause trouble, yet after glancing back, these people frantically increased their speed and left.

Ling Han looked back, only to see Xia Wuque and his followers casually walking over. The group of people from before were most likely scared off by Xia Wuque.

Xia Wuque smiled faintly, and said, “Hehe, we meet again! The fate between us is indeed strong!”

However, he was also a little puzzled. There had only been Ling Han and Shui Yanyu before, so why was there suddenly a cultivator at the Shattering Void Tier and a puppet wolf with them?
