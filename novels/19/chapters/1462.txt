Chapter 1463 Seeking Life in the Midst of Death

“He’s done for!” the cultivators exclaimed as they shook their heads.

However, they were genuinely impressed that he was able to withstand that devastating heavenly tribulation until now. What Ling Han was facing was the fury of heaven and earth! The power of humans was limited, yet the power of heaven and earth was unlimited. As such, how could he withstand the punishment of heaven and earth?

Not a single person thought that Ling Han wasn’t a prodigy. However, even so, there was little more that he could do. Before the might of heaven and earth, even Genesis Tier Saints had to bow their proud heads. If this weren’t the case, Saints should have been able to resist the fateful cycle of life, sickness, and death; they should have been able to transcend the Regulations of heaven and earth.

However, not only did Saints have a limited lifespan, but they even had to face their own form of tribulation—Immortal’s Tribulation[1]. If they failed to withstand this, their life force would be mercilessly severed.

This was enough to prove that heaven and earth could kill whomever they wanted. Once the will of heaven and earth was set, no one could possibly seek to change it.

In any case, who told Ling Han to obtain such a great opportunity, advancing two minor levels at once? Now that he was facing a twofold heavenly tribulation, he had no option but to die with bitterness and regret.

Moreover, who would have imagined that Ling Han’s great opportunity would wound up becoming his great disaster?

However, some people were extremely glad to witness his misfortune. Since they were unable to become a powerful king tier themself, they took great joy in witnessing the death of those powerful king tiers. In fact, they yearned for everyone more powerful than themselves to be killed. That way, they would finally be able to make a name for themselves.

“This doesn’t seem right! This brat isn’t destined to die so young!” The large black dog stopped chasing and biting people, standing up on his hind legs and clasping his front paws behind his back. An enigmatic aura emanated from him, and it was as if he were pondering a profound question.

However, the sight of his iron underwear completely ruined his solemn and profound airs. Anyhow, he immediately revealed his true colors anyway, shaking his head and saying, “Forget about it. Whether he lives or dies has sh*t to do with Grandpa Dog.”

Ling Han’s situation was becoming direr and direr. His heavenly tribulation was becoming increasingly powerful, and even with the protection of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, the speed of his recovery was still far slower than the speed at which he was getting wounded. From his head to toe, it was almost impossible to find any piece of unshattered bone.

However, he was still fighting, determination and tenacity in his eyes. He would never give up. He would fight until the last moment.

He had already summoned his Divine Demon Sword long ago, this sword radiating with a brilliant celestial light as it resisted the attacks of the tribulation. Even though it was only a Level 11 God Tool, it was radiating an aura that could sow apprehension in one’s heart. It possessed a wisp of might that should have only existed in Celestial Tools.

Under the tempering of the twofold heavenly tribulation, the Divine Demon Sword was also able to undergo a comprehensive qualitative improvement.

Ling Han continued to circulate drops of Indestructible True Fluid, speeding up the process of his recovery. However, the effects of the Indestructible True Fluid would decrease significantly when used in quick succession. It wasn’t long before he consumed all 10 drops of Indestructible True Fluid.

However, the twofold heavenly tribulation was still attacking him without mercy.

Kuang!

A bolt of lightning arced down, severing one of Ling Han’s arms. Godly blood sprayed into the surroundings. However, this blood was full of vitality, and it provided nourishment to the piece of land that it fell on. The plants and trees in this area instantly grew with renewed vigor, shooting up 30 or so meters.

Kuang!

Another bolt of lightning descended, severing one of Ling Han’s legs. Similar to before, a large swathe of land in the distance was transformed into an Elysian-like area. Countless Godly medicines sprouted and grew, many of them reaching Level nine or even Level 10.

Kuang!

This bolt of lethal lightning struck Ling Han’s neck, almost ripping his body into two. Blood exploded from his body and rained down on the surrounding lands, providing the entire abyss with vitality and nourishment. The abyss transformed from a land of desolation into a land of lush greenery.

Kuang!

Heaven and earth were merciless, and they launched the killing blow.

Pa!

Ling Han was blasted into ashes.

This time, Ling Han hadn’t actively shattered his Godly bones. Instead, he had genuinely been blasted into pieces.

‘He’s done for... A supreme king tier was killed just like that...’

This was a king tier who could rival the power of Gu Daoyi!

“Brilliant!” Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi both sneered in delight. They had both been screwed over by Ling Han before. Even though they had reached the peak again, they had both fallen to the floor of the abyss again because of the “hanging dog” incident. In the end, they had failed to receive any benefits.

Upon witnessing the death of Ling Han, they were naturally beside themselves with delight. It was as if they had eaten some sweet honey.

With Ling Han dead, his heavenly tribulation naturally started to dissipate as well. However, just as the dark clouds started to dissipate, they immediately started to converge together again.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was confused by this sudden change. Perhaps heaven and earth wanted to mutilate his corpse?

However, not even a single fiber of Ling Han’s being was remaining. So, how could heaven and earth mutilate his non-existent corpse?

Boom!

They suddenly saw a burst of flames materializing in the sky. This flame then frenziedly spread throughout the sky, a figure gradually appearing from within it. This figure rapidly took shape before eventually stepping out.

‘It’s Ling Han!’

‘Holy f*ck!’

Everyone opened their eyes as wide as they could upon seeing this, their heads completely numb with shock.

‘He was clearly killed by heavenly tribulation, with not even an iota of his body remaining. In fact, even his tribulation had started to dissipate... so how has he come back from the dead?’

Ling Han slowly stepped forward, the boundless flames being absorbed into his body as he did so. His spirit and vitality were elevated to the extreme.

Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, Rising From The Ashes!

There was a solemn expression on his face. This was his most powerful trump card, so what would he do if he were still unable to withstand this twofold heavenly tribulation?

Kuang!

The tribulation continued to unleash violent strikes against him, the bolts of divine lightning becoming more and more powerful. This twofold heavenly tribulation had already lasted for almost two entire days. However, after unleashing a furious bolt of divine lightning, Ling Han’s heavenly tribulation suddenly came to a stop, not unleashing any more attacks. Instead, the dark clouds dissipated, revealing the sun and bright sky that rested behind it.

The terrifying heavenly tribulation had finally come to an end!

Ling Han was riddled with wounds, and he heavily plonked down onto the ground. As strong as his willpower was, he still couldn’t help but feel as if his body were about to collapse.

Everyone gazed at him with respect and admiration in their eyes. In fact, there was even a hint of fear. It was as if they were looking at a freak, not a person.

He had died, yet then come back to life again. Who had ever witnessed such an astounding scene before?

Ling Han furrowed his brows. In order to overcome the heavenly tribulation, he had revealed his most powerful trump card in front of everyone else. As such, he would lose the element of surprise in the future. Fortunately, he still possessed another trump card. That was, of course, the Black Tower. It was even more indestructible than the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

In addition, he hadn’t revealed the secret of the Nine Heavens Flame, either. This was a trump card that was no weaker than the Black Tower.

“Gu Daoyi, come battle me!” Ling Han shouted as he stood up.

The battle between Gu Daoyi and Empress Luan Xing had already reached a critical and intense stage. Moreover, Gu Daoyi was enjoying the advantage!

Although Empress Luan Xing was astonishingly powerful, she still couldn’t overcome the tremendous power of Gu Daoyi, especially since he possessed a Divine Fetus. If it weren’t for the brick in her hands, perhaps she would have already been defeated long ago.

How could Ling Han watch on as his wife was being ruthlessly attacked?

Gu Daoyi stopped his attacks and turned around to gaze at Ling Han. There was a wary look in his eyes.

Even he would struggle if he were attacked by both Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing.

“You want to battle against me?” he asked in a menacing voice.

“Although husband and wife are one, I won’t bully you this time. Let us battle, one against one!” Ling Han extended his arm, preparing to battle. Although he was bathed in blood, his aura instantly rose explosively at this moment.

“A mere ant like—”

Peng!

Gu Daoyi was still expressing his disdain, yet Ling Han had already launched a punch toward him, forcing him to instantly swallow his words. He hurriedly retreated 900 or so meters.

‘Again?!’

Gu Daoyi was beside himself with fury. This was exactly the same as before. He had wanted to mock and ridicule Ling Han, yet his words were forced back into his mouth by Ling Han’s attacks every single time. He couldn’t string together a single complete sentence.

“Detestable!” Gu Daoyi gave up on trying to ridicule Ling Han. He was going to kill Ling Han!

“Mystical Power of Ten Lives!”

The Mystical Powers of all his lifetimes were unleashed one after another. In the end, they all combined to form a devastating combination attack. Nine other clones of Gu Daoyi then appeared, each representing one of his past lives. Attacking in unison, they unleashed the 10 Mystical Powers which then surged toward Ling Han.

This time, he was attacking while at his full power. Moreover, he even had a Saint Tool in his hands. He was tremendously powerful.

Ling Han smiled calmly, not hiding his own power, either. He immediately unleashed heaven’s might, forcefully suppressing Gu Daoyi’s power by two stars. At the same time, he slashed down with his Divine Demon Sword, sending brilliant celestial light into the surroundings. Raising his hand, boundless rays of divine light instantly shot outward, their brightness so great that the spectating cultivators could barely open their eyes.

The cultivators in the second stage had mastered the Sun Physique with just a wisp of the Sun Stone’s power. However, Ling Han had been cultivating inside this Sun Stone. Thus, the sum of the benefits received by all of the other cultivators was negligible before the benefits that Ling Han had received. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was also because of this that he had been able to advance from the early stage of the high extreme to the peak stage of the pinnacle level. In fact, if it weren’t for the immense difficulty presented by the barrier to the Eternal River Tier, Ling Han could have advanced even further.

However, if he had genuinely broken through to the Eternal River Tier, he would have been met with a threefold heavenly tribulation. If that had been the case, he definitely would have been killed.

Gu Daoyi couldn’t help but feel vexed.
