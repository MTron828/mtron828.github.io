Chapter 3428: Battle of Spiritual Powers

Translator: Henyee Translations ] Editor: Henyee Translations

When the Heavenly Pattern Jade hit its target, there would be no ‘after’. Pa, Lu Ge’s fist shattered, then his forearm shattered, his whole arm shattered. The Heavenly Pattern Jade was unstoppable, and once again smashed into Lu Ge’s neck. Instantly, his head turned into a shower of blood.

The destructive power of a blunt weapon delivered at nine times the speed of sound was indescribably terrifying.

Peng1 Lu Ge collapsed to the ground, already becoming a headless corpse. The skin on his upper body was also completely shattered. This had been forcefully torn apart by a terrifying force, and he was badly mangled. It was a tragic sight.

Everyone was dumbfounded, completely incapable of reacting.

This strike had insta-killed a Five Inscriptions!

What kind of concept was that? With such might, even an Enlightenment Tier elite would have a very high chance of being killed if they faced it head-on.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s pupils contracted rapidly, almost forming into a single point. He said darkly, “Spiritual Power Tool!”

As expected of the Seventh Imperial Prince, he had good insight.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “That s right.

As he spoke, Sixth Baby had already scrambled back with the Heavenly Pattern

Jade on her shoulder.

The Seventh Imperial Prince stared at the jade for a while, then asked, “This is

Heavenly Pattern Jade, right?”

Ling Han nodded again.

-Very good. With the strength of my Spiritual Power, combined with this Spiritual Power Tool, it is not impossible to kill even Mystery Realm Tier elites.” The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded, an expression of greed appearing on his face.

This was the material for a Two Star Tool, and even he couldn’t help but be tempted.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You’re thinking too much.”

■■Do you really think that with Absolute Fairness, I can’t do anything to you?” the Seventh Imperial Prince said leisurely.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless, as the Seventh Imperial Prince was also skilled in spiritual power. Moreover, it was extremely likely that his spiritual power was superior to Ling Han’s. After all, the Seventh Imperial Prince had sacrificed an entire city to forcefully push his spiritual power to the level of Great Accomplishment.

Of course, this level of Great Accomplishment he was talking about was definitely below the Celestial Path.

“Go!” The Seventh Imperial Prince raised his finger slightly. Shua, a cold light swept past, and a bright sharp sword shot rapidly towards Ling Han. There was still golden energy entwined around the tip of the sword.

Seven times the speed of sound!

Ling Han’s heart clenched. This strike from the Seventh Imperial Prince did not seem to have reached the speed at which he had thrown out the Heavenly Pattern Jade. However, the Seventh Imperial Prince had not used any mystical power or physical power either. This was an attack of pure Spiritual Power. If he was purely using Spiritual Power to control a weapon, then it should only be five times the speed of sound – Spiritual Power and actual power overlapped, and the speed was not calculated in terms of one plus one, but rather would be considerably inferior.

Even so, if the Seventh Imperial Prince first threw his sword, and then used Spiritual Power,, how many times the speed of sound would he be able to reach?

More than ten times was a sure thing.

If the flying sword approached at ten times the speed of sound, would he be able to dodge it?

Ling Han’s figure moved, dodging this strike, while he shook his head internally. If it was ten times the speed of sound, then with the present distance of 33 meters between the two of them, there was definitely no way he could dodge.

Then what could he do?

Though the Seventh Imperial Prince did not have the Heavenly Pattern Jade, when the flying sword struck at ten times the speed of sound, its destructive power was also incredibly terrifying.

What was his trump card was actually something that the other considered his strength?

Ling Han searched for a countermeasure in his mind. He instantly had a preliminary idea.

Since… he could use his Spiritual Power to speed up, why couldn’t he slow things down then?

The Seventh Imperial Prince smirked coldly, and with a wave of his hand, another flying sword shot towards Ling Han.

Ling Han didn’t dodge. Instead, he used his Spiritual Power to wrap around the flying sword and slow it down when it was 15 meters away from him.

The flying sword weighed about 1.5kg, but with the boost of seven times the speed of sound, the impact it created was extremely shocking. Thankfully, Spiritual power was formless and would not be injured by sharp weapons. Otherwise, if he had wrapped his Spiritual power around it rashly, he would definitely be severely injured.

However, with the continuous obstruction of the spiritual power, the speed of the flying sword finally slowed down. When it reached Ling Han, it was only left with three times the speed of sound.

He then stretched out his hand to pluck it, and grabbed hold of the flying sword.

“I’ll give it back to you!” Ling Han tossed out the flying sword, and then accelerated it with his spiritual power. Xiu, it reached eight times the speed of sound.

The Seventh Imperial Prince sent out a punch. Pa, the flying sword instantly dropped down from the air.

This wasn’t because his punch had been so powerful, but rather because he had also used his Spiritual Power to slow down the speed of the flying sword. Then, combined with the power of Enlightenment Tier, he had shaken the flying sword down.

“Without Absolute Fairness, how can you be a match for me?” the Seventh Imperial Prince said proudly. This time, he raised his hand and tossed a sword out. Xiu, the flying sword turned into a streak of light, its blade blazing.

This wasn’t because it was entwined with high-level energy, but because the speed of the flying sword had broken through ten times the speed of sound, and created a fierce friction with the air, forcibly burning the sword’s blade red. Eleven times the speed of sound, or even twelve times the speed of sound, it was completely impossible to dodge.

Ling Han could only use his spiritual power to form a heavy net to continuously block the attacks. The speed of the flying sword finally dropped to around seven times the speed of sound, and was still astonishingly fast. However, Ling Han had already swung his fist, which was entwined with the energy of Stone, boosting his defense.

Peng!

The fist crashed into the sword, and the flying sword was instantly sent flying. This wasn’t Heavenly Pattern Jade. It weighed only about 3kg. Otherwise, if it smashed towards Ling Han at seven times the speed of sound, it was guaranteed that Ling Han’s bones would immediately break. Even if the energy of Stone was wrapped around it, it would be useless.

Even so, blood was still dripping from his fists. The Seventh Imperial Prince had wrapped high-level energy around the flying sword, greatly increasing its destructive power.

Ling Han raised his hand to take a look. Thankfully, his bones had not been shattered.

“En?” The Seventh Imperial Prince was slightly surprised. He had not thought that this blow would be so easily dispersed by Ling Han. “I used the Blood Divine Crystal to push my spiritual power to Great Accomplishment level, and you are actually only slightly weaker than me. How do you cultivate?” This was naturally because Ling Han had the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Every night, he would go in and take a nap, and his Spiritual Power would soar. Of course, Ling Han also paid a lot of attention to training during normal times. Whether it was refining pills or setting up formations, it was actually a way to train his Spiritual Power.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “So what if you have sacrificed so many innocent people? You have only made yourself bear the burden of sin.

“So what?” The Seventh Imperial Prince smirked coldly, “For the sake of my grand ambition and dominance, what could not be sacrificed? As long as I inherit the throne, I will definitely do better than my Imperial Father!” He was brimming with confidence. This was because Chen Fengyan had been cultivating in seclusion for at least 10 months in the past year. He had only spent two months in the government, yet he had already allowed the Dark North Nation to become peaceful and prosperous. If it were him, a great ruler, the empire would naturally become even more prosperous.

Ling Han shook his head, “I had initially thought that you were an ambitious and ruthless character, but from the look of things now, you are nothing but a selfish vile character.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Impudence!” The Seventh Imperial Prince humphed, and with a wave of his hand, shua, another sword shot out.

One strike followed by another. Shua, shua, shua, he shot out thirteen flying swords in a single stroke.

This was incredibly terrifying. Every flying sword possessed eleven times, twelve times the speed of sound. Though there was a difference in speed due to the order they had been thrown out, it was really pitifully small.

Ling Han unleashed his Spiritual Power and wrapped it around them again. Weng, weng, weng! One after another, the flying swords seemed to have entered into a swamp, and their speed instantly slowed down. They were sent flying by Ling Han, one after another, but Ling Han’s fists had also become bloody..
