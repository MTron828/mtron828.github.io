Chapter 319: Lord Bao

The plump young man moved extremely fast, and if Ling Han did not still have a sliver of the divine sense of the Heaven Tier, he would definitely have discovered the trick the young man had played. However, with his sharp eyes, this fake Whatever Sphere could not have possibly deceived him.

“Come, come, come. Because you look pleasing to my eyes, I’ll just ask for ten Origin Crystals.” The plump young man came closer, and extended the ball towards Ling Han.

Ling Han received the ball, and said, smiling, “How about if I explode you, then I wouldn’t have to pay a single Origin Crystal. While that would mean one less time I can use this, it is still a rather profitable bargain.”

The plump young man laughed and said, “My tanned brother, you are really a great joker.”

Ling Han gave a flick of his fingers, and the ball shot quickly towards the skies.

The plump young man could not help but follow it with his eyes and raised his head to look at the skies.

Ling Han moved to grab the hairpin on his head, and said with a smile, “I don’t want that Whatever Sphere. I only want this hairpin on your head.”

The plump young man was shocked and hurriedly raised his right hand. Weng , instantly, an intricate pattern of designs on his sleeve lit up, forming a gentle white light which blocked Ling Han’s attack.

He experienced a slight tremble, and Ling Han could not help but take two steps back. He only felt a numbness in his right hand—there actually appeared spiderweb-like cracks on his hand, from which blood was seeping out, forming beads of blood on his hand.

But when he circulated the Indestructible Heaven Scroll, the wound immediately healed, and he was instantly unscathed again.

“Yo, so you’re an expert!” The plump young man came back to his senses and stretched open his hand to catch the ball that Ling Han had previously thrown. Pa , unfortunately he had initially wanted to act cool, so he had not looked up at the skies at all. Who would have guessed that he had estimated wrongly, and the ball heavily dropped onto his head.

“Aiyo!” He quickly stretched out his hands to cover his head, and his cool image was instantly ruined.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Just from the outfit you’re dressed in, no ordinary sect would be able to afford to develop you, so why have you come all the way here to trick little kids?”

“Ai, I won’t deceive you. I’m just strong in appearance but weak in reality. If it wasn’t because I had this outfit as support, when I encounter an expert like you, wouldn’t I have the tables turned on me and be robbed? As the saying goes, if one is travelling around the country, one has to do two jobs at once and attach equal importance to each,” the plump young man chattered endlessly, without the slightest embarrassment from being caught red-handed.

“Hehe, how should I address you?” Ling Han patted his shoulder.

“As the saying goes, if one is travelling outside, you have to depend on friends. My surname is Ma, and my name is Duo Bao. Others call me Lord Bao, but because we’ve hit it off so well, you can just call me Big Brother Bao,” the plump young man declared casually.

“I say, Little Brother Bao, we’re considered friends, and as the saying goes, you could stab knives at both sides for a friend. But I don’t really need you to pierce yourself with a knife. However, this belt doesn’t look bad, so why not just give it to me!” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Ah pei!” Ma Duo Bao instantly jumped. “You are really greedy. How much have I paid just to get this Black Jade Belt? Furthermore, I am Lord Bao, or Big Brother Bao, not Little Brother Bao!”

“Your surname is Ma, so why don’t I call you Bao Ma!” Ling Han patted his shoulder, and continued, “This pair of shoes are not too bad either, and from what I can see, our feet are about the same size, so why don’t we exchange shoes?”

“No way!” Ma Duo Bao rolled his eyes. “I say, how can you be even more two-faced than me?”

“Don’t wrong me, I am very pure,” Ling Han replied in a deadpan voice.

“Pure your sister!” Ma Duo Bao hurriedly ran off, and as he ran, he continued to say, “Don’t waste the precious time I have to earn money. I’m going to go and con a few more idiots!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Pa, pa, pa . By the time he had said his last words, there was already no sign of him.

Ling Han’s expression tensed slightly. This young man was very unusual. From head to toe, whatever he wore were all Spirit Tools, and he himself gave Ling Han the feeling that he couldn’t see through the former at all. The current world of martial arts was prospering, and not only were geniuses appearing endlessly like spring bamboo right after a shower, but so monsters and freaks were coming out successively.

He did not believe that he was the only one who had noticed that Ma Duo Bao was covered in Spirit Tools, but this brat was still living smoothly like a fish in water, so he had to have some tricks of his own that even those in the older generation did not make a move against him.

A smile curled up the corners of Ling Han’s lips. He had now changed his appearance. Even if he entered the Black Tower in public or use the Demon Birth Sword, who would have any idea who he was? Of course, if he could avoid using them, that was best. The most important thing now was to first get hold of the Thunder Battle Armor and create trouble at the Winter Moon Sect while he was at it.

Ling Han returned to his original spot and was just planning to rest for a moment when he saw a young man dressed in purple come over. There were more than ten people following behind him, and he carried himself with such arrogance as if his eyes were growing on his forehead.

“Hey, brat, during the trial tomorrow, just join our Zhao Alliance and become my underling,” the purple-clad young man said, as if he was merely making a statement.

“Come and thank our Lord Zhao quickly. Otherwise, for a brat that is going solo like you, that would definitely be delivering yourself up to die!” One of his lackeys instantly started flattering.

“Brat, do you know how many famous geniuses have appeared this time around? Do you know of the Little Overlord Spear, Yang Chong? He’s going to participate tomorrow as well. There’s also the Sword of Justice, Bai Ming, and that’s someone who has been praised as being able to split apart a mountain with a single strike!” the others added.

“If you meet with these people, your only fate would be death. That’s why we have gathered in a group—only if we stay united by Lord Zhao’s side would we be able to survive.”

“You don’t have to think about the top 100. Even the Winter Moon Sect would be sending their young elites to participate, so it’d be fine as long as we can enter into the top 10,000. After another five years, those of us who have still not yet reached thirty years old would naturally be able to participate in the trial next time, and at that time, we can compete for a good ranking.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Your plans are quite good. However, a bunch of trash united together is still trash. I’m sorry, but I have no plans to work together with trash. That would lower my standing.”

“Insolence!” These guys shouted in their anger and were just about to make a move on Ling Han, but were stopped by that purple-clad young man.

“It is strictly forbidden to make trouble at this moment. Whoever creates trouble will be disqualified, and in serious cases, they would even be killed on the spot!” the purple-clad young man rebuked sternly. He turned to look at Ling Han, and said with a smirk, “Tanned brat, you will submit to pressure only after turning down our request. Heng, make sure we don’t meet tomorrow. If I don’t rip out all the bones of your body, then my name is not Zhao Ri!”

A flash of killing intent flickered in Ling Han’s eyes as well, and he said calmly, “If you are so desperate to seek your death, I would not mind killing a few pieces of trash.”

“Heng, let’s go!” Zhao Ri led the others away, and headed elsewhere to collect lackeys.

There were many people like that who were ensuring their positions with both money and ability. That was because it was not safe enough to simply buy plaques. The trial would last for three days, and if they were targeted by a powerful elite and subsequently robbed, then wouldn’t that be a complete waste of their money?

As a result, those with the slightest bit of intelligence had begun to seek out lackeys. After all, there was strength in numbers, and others would not easily dare to assault them if there were many of them gathered together.

Ling Han was all alone by himself, and so was naturally continuously targeted by others who wanted to pull him into their camps. After all, “the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier” was not considered weak anymore, and among the young generation, could be considered quite powerful.
