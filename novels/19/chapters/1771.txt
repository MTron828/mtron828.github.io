Chapter 1772: Playing a Piece

Fu Gaoyun enjoyed music, and this was something that everyone was aware of. Thus, it was also extremely easy for his followers to flatter him. They simply needed to ask him to play a few pieces, and this would definitely delight Fu Gaoyun to no end.

However, now was different. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After being led astray by Ling Han, Fu Gaoyun seldom played his guqin anymore. This was because he would involuntarily recall Descending Lotus Flowers each time he tried to play a piece. In the end, he would go completely astray and start playing the Descending Lotus Flowers instead.

As a young master of the Fu Clan, how could he play such a tasteless piece?

Thus, asking him to play a piece or two wasn’t flattering him anymore. Instead, it was offending him.

“Yeh, that’s right. Young Master Yun, why don’t you play a piece of two,” someone else said in encouragement.

How could they know about the trauma in Fu Gaoyun’s mind? Thus, they all started to encourage him to play a few pieces.

Fu Gaoyun couldn’t withstand their enthusiasm, so he could only retrieve his guqin and forcefully calm himself down. Many days had passed, and with his powerful mindset, he had naturally walked out from that crooked path already. However, the condition was that he didn’t think of Ling Han. Otherwise, his tune would definitely go astray again.

‘I won’t think about it! I won’t think about it!’

He closed his eyes and placed his fingers onto the guqin. Clear and spring-like sounds instantly flowed out from his instrument.

Objectively speaking, Fu Gaoyun was indeed extremely talented in music. Of course, this was fairly inevitable. After all, having lived long enough, and having enough talent, what couldn’t one become skilled at as long as they put in the effort?

Everyone swayed their head in intoxication.

Regardless of whether they truly enjoyed music or not, they definitely had to act as if they did at this moment.

Meanwhile, Ling Han yawned in boredom. He didn’t have a single artistic bone in his body, and if he had the spare time, he would rather cultivate or research alchemy than waste his time listening to music. He smiled at the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and a mischievous thought was already forming in his mind.

He extended a finger and started to lightly tap the teacup before him. This was none other than the tune of Descending Lotus Flowers.

This sound was extremely soft, yet almost everyone present was at the Severing Mundane Tier. As such, how could they not hear it? However, most of them didn’t mind, as the sound was truly very soft. Yet, it was a completely different situation for Fu Gaoyun.

His eyes were closed, and his mind was completely focused. To him, listening to himself playing the guqin was a great source of enjoyment. At this moment, however, a familiar tune suddenly crept into his mind.

‘D-Descending Lotus Flowers!’

There was a ring, and the tune of his piece immediately started to change. Fu Gaoyun almost choked upon hearing this.

‘No, I’m not going to listen! I’m not going to listen!’

He hurriedly repeated this in his mind, yet the more he repeated it, the clearer that faint sound became. In the end, it transformed into a roaring river that surged through his mind. In the end, his fingers also started to go astray, and he started to play Descending Lotus Flowers instead.

Everyone faltered upon hearing this, and they couldn’t help but exchange confused glances. They could all see the puzzlement and awkwardness in each others’ eyes.

What in the world was Young Master Yun playing? Why did it sound like the story of a beggar?

“Forget about it! Forget about it!” Fu Gaoyun said. He finally came to his senses, and he immediately pushed his guqin away. His expression was as if he had endured great humiliation.

Meanwhile, everyone else was wearing strange expressions. They wanted to laugh, yet they didn’t dare to. They wanted to speak, yet they also didn’t dare to. They felt as stifled as could be.

“Hahahaha!” However, Ling Han immediately roared with laughter. He was the culprit, and he also dared to admit that he was the culprit.

Facing Ling Han, Fu Gaoyun could only shake his head in exasperation.

“What’s so enjoyable?” a young man asked as he walked over. He was stumbling a little, and his steps were slightly uneven.

“Brother Cheng!” everyone immediately said in greeting.

This person was Cheng Zhong, a member of the Cheng Clan, one of the most powerful subordinate clans of the Fu Clan. Thus, Cheng Zhong’s support was incredibly important to Fu Gaoyun. Of course, it was still difficult to say who would become the next clan leader of the Cheng Clan. It wasn’t necessarily certain that Cheng Zhong would become the future clan leader.

Because of the Cheng Clan’s power, it was only natural that everyone treated Cheng Zhong with respect. In fact, even Fu Gaoyun had to give him face.

“Cheng Zhong, what’s wrong?” Fu Gaoyun asked casually.

Cheng Zhong shook his head, and replied, “Don’t mention it. I was bitten by a dog.”

‘What?!’

Everyone almost spat out a mouthful of tea upon hearing this. After all, this was far too ridiculous!

What was Cheng Zhong’s cultivation level? He was at the middle stage of the fourth severance! At the same time, he was also the most powerful follower of Fu Gaoyun. However, an elite such as him had actually been bitten by a dog? If word of this spread, they would definitely be mocked to death!

Meanwhile, Ling Han wore a strange expression upon hearing this. Why did this sound so familiar?

“How is that possible?” Fu Gaoyun asked in astonishment. However, he immediately saw the funny side of this, and he asked, “You’re so powerful, so how could you have been bitten by a dog?”

“Sigh!” Cheng Zhong sighed loudly before saying, “I don’t know what happened, either. I came across Fu Zhengtong when I was heading over, and seeing him running away in disarray, I casually asked how a dog like him had been wounded. However, a large black dog suddenly leaped out from nowhere, and it viciously bit at my bum. It bloody hurt like hell!”

Everyone was astonished upon hearing this. He had been bitten just like that?

He was at the fourth severance!

With this information, Ling Han could already confirm that this was the act of none other than the large black dog! Strange... Why had that detestable dog suddenly run over here? Whom did it want to screw over now?

“When did such a beast appear in the Heaven Departing City?” Fu Gaoyun asked in puzzlement. “Did some powerful being obtain a new immortal beast pet, but not eliminate its wild tendencies yet?”

“No!” Cheng Zhong said with a shake of his head. “That large black dog was even wearing a pair of iron underwear, and it was so dazzling that it almost blinded me! It was a horrible sight!”

Pu!

Someone finally couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of tea.

“Come, sit over here and calm down first,” Fu Gaoyun said. It was hard to seek revenge after being bitten by a dog. After all, they couldn’t go over to bite the dog, could they?

Cheng Zhong hurriedly shook his hands, and said, “No need, no need!”

How would he dare to sit? His bum was hurting like crazy!

Everyone grinned in their minds. This was a fairly hilarious encounter. Of course, it was a miserable encounter for the person who was involved.

“I’ve gathered everyone here today not only to touch base, but also to discuss an important matter.” Fu Gaoyun raised his hand and signified for silence. “The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm is about to open, and we need to determine who’s going to enter.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up at the mention of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

This was most likely the ruins of some ancient great sect. When discovered in the past, there had even been a piece of Divine Metal inside, and this had triggered an earth-shattering battle between three Celestial King Tier forces.

From that point onward, no other rare treasures had appeared in the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, but some powerful forces would still occasionally send some people over to try their luck. However, such situations were relatively rare.

To the Fu Clan, however, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm was an incredibly important resource. This was because the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm produced a kind of matter called Blood Dragon Stones. These Blood Dragon Stones were extremely helpful in raising the cultivation level of those at the Severing Mundane Tier, and they could even strengthen one’s divine sense, and help them build a solid foundation for advancing to the Dividing Soul Tier.

From time to time, they would also find some lost cultivation techniques and celestial techniques in this Mystery Realm. Once perfected, these cultivation techniques and celestial techniques could potentially even reach the level of the Immortal Palace Tier or Ascending Origin Tier. These were incredibly freakish techniques.

Anyhow, because of the earth-shattering battle that had occurred inside the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, there were currents of extremely terrifying auras suffusing the entire mystery realm. However, once every 30,000,000 years, a volcano inside the mystery realm would erupt, temporarily suppressing the wild and terrifying auras. During this time, cultivators would be able to enter.

Moreover, apart from lava, this volcano also produced Blood Dragon Stones.

Even so, one would still need to wear outer garments that were specially made from scraps of Blood Dragon Stones if they wanted to safely enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Otherwise, their fate could only be death. However, these outer garments were extremely rare, and their effects would also weaken with the passing of time. Thus, they were essentially single-use items.

That being the case, only a limited number of people were allowed to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.
