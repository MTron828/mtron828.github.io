2706 Great destruction

The giant egg cracked, and there was a person that was contained within, curled up in a fetal position with his arms around his knees.

‘Sorry for this!’ Ling Han said inwardly. He delivered a stab with the Divine Demon Sword, which sank directly into that person’s forehead.

The Heavenly Venerate Tool unleashed its might, so that person naturally could only die immediately.

There was no empathetic grief from the heaven and earth, because this person had already left the threshold of the Celestial King Tier, and become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. The heaven and earth would not feel the slightest pity at the passing of such an existence.

Ling Han walked over to the next giant egg, and did the same.

His efficiency was very high. The Divine Demon Sword was invincible, and these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were still in the strengthening process, so they did not have the ability to fight back at all. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Though there were tens of thousands of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates here, with Ling Han’s strength, just how long would it take him to make a round in this place?

Pa, pa, pa! One after another, the giant eggs shattered, blood seeping out of them, and turning this place into a living hell.

Most importantly, Ling Han had even exerted time-acceleration effects on himself, so his speed was naturally even more astonishing.

In just less than two hours, most of the giant eggs here had been shattered.

“You, what are you doing!” The extremely furious voice of Desolate Moon rang out. Boom! A flash of light sliced towards him.

Ling Han did not dodge, his right hand continuously striking out with the Divine Demon Sword. Pu! Another Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was soundlessly killed by him, and Ling Han threw a punch backwards. Peng! That light that had sneaked up to him was instantly shattered.

“You!!” When Desolate Moon saw Ling Han’s true face, his fury blazed even hotter.

Originally, he would have long since completed his mission, but because of Ling Han’s escape from the Celestial King Graveyard, he had no choice but to relocate those Celestial Kings on a great scale, so the process of advancement for these Celestial Kings was interrupted.

Fortunately, because he was well-prepared, it was not impossible for him to continue the process. Throughout these many years, the majority of Celestial Kings had already advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Just when it looked like he was about to succeed, Ling Han had come again.

This time, the destruction he had caused was irreversible. Just look at those eggs; just how few of them were left?

Only 100 at most!

Damn it, damn it. For the sake of this day, just what great efforts he had committed, and just how much energy had Hysteria exerted? Yet now, it was all ruined by a puny Celestial King.

In his rage, Desolate Moon wanted to make a move, but when he suddenly recalled the domineering force of that punch from Ling Han, he couldn’t help but suppress this urge.

Desolate Moon had not seen Ling Han for tens of millions of years, and this young man who had not even been worth a mention in his eyes all those years ago had already matured to the point that even Desolate Moon could only look up at the height the other had attained. A single punch had easily destroyed his attack; this was too powerful.

With a single thought, Desolate Moon made his decision immediately. Opening his mouth, he released a cry.

This cry was extremely shrill. Pa, pa, pa, pa! One after another, the giant eggs actually shattered.

They had not been shattered by his cry. Instead, it was the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that lay within awakening after they heard this sound wave.

This kind of interruption caused their evolution to stop completely. It was impossible that they would have any further room for improvement in the future, but if he did not awaken these people, they could only be killed by Ling Han one after another.

“Kill him!” Desolate Moon pointed at Ling Han.

Instantly, those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates set their eyes on Ling Han. Xiu, xiu, xiu! They shot out, charging towards Ling Han.

Ling Han only swept a glance over, and inwardly counted the number of these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

102.

If there were only 10 of them, Ling Han would face them even if it meant that he would be injured. A sweep of the Divine Demon Sword would be able to kill at least half of them. However, over 100? He shook his head mentally; forget it.

While he could indeed kill a few Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with a single strike, letting over 100 attacks land on him would guarantee that even his physique would be blasted into bits in an instant.

…About 100 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could possibly kill a single Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. What about around 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates then?

It was possible that even a genuine Heavenly Venerate could be killed.

Ling Han retreated.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! These Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had received a command, and would thus loyally execute it. They all set out in swift pursuit of Ling Han.

“Kill him, you must kill him!” Desolate Moon exclaimed in fury. If Ling Han could not be killed, how was he to explain this to Hysteria?

The plan was definitely ruined now. Indeed, around 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could cause some damage, but how could it be compared with tens of thousands of them?

Killing Ling Han could only be considered as a tiny part of the revenge.

Ling Han ran swiftly. This space was very big, enough to allow over 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates to unleash their attacks completely. It would be too disadvantageous for him to battle here.

He ran, and the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates chased after him.

This mountainside was extraordinarily huge, just like a plain. After running for a long while, Ling Han finally saw the end of it. There was actually a canyon here, but the top of the canyon was the dark body of the mountain. It was covered by lava, which spread out like a cobweb.

When he arrived in this canyon, there were seven people that were blasting madly here.

Without even thinking about it, Ling Han knew that these people were all the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates here, because they were all bare and naked.

A’mu and the others were in the canyon!

This scene had naturally appeared in the memory images that Du Shiyi had given him. Ling Han released a battle cry, and charged towards that canyon.

Behind him, the 100-plus Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were still rapidly chasing him.

Sensing Ling Han’s arrival, the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that were attacking the canyon together all turned around, sending an attack his way.

Ling Han turned and diverted, and did not take these attacks head-on to avoid being caught up with by the larger number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates behind him.

Thankfully, there were also violent attacks blasting out in the canyon, allowing Ling Han to rush in easily.

Perhaps these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates did not care who entered at all. What was more important was that nobody left alive.

Boom!

A larger number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were attacking madly, wanting to rip apart this entire canyon.

Fortunately, though the mountain rocks could not withstand the violent force of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tiers, they seemed to have a life of their own. Very quickly, they would grow out again, and their recovery speed was extremely quick.

Precisely because of this, A’mu and company managed to avert disaster, and defend themselves for countless years.

“Ling Han!”

Seeing that the person who had rushed in was actually Ling Han, A’mu and Can Yue both exclaimed. This was too unexpected.

“Hey, guys,” Ling Han said with a chuckle, waving a hand in greeting.

“Now is not the time for you guys to reminisce!” someone said. He had a wine gourd in hand, which was spraying out green light. This light was very amazing, being capable of even blocking the attack of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

Only then did A’mu and Can Yue come back to their senses. They hurriedly joined the ranks of defense against the invasion of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han glanced at them. With him, there were a total of eight people here. Only one of them was a woman, and from Du Shiyi’s memories, he knew that her name was Liu Ziyan.

These seven people were all peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, their Evolution Index either 11 or 12. They had come here so that they could obtain a trigger for their breakthrough to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Otherwise, even if they possessed Heavenly-Venerable-Tier treasures, they could not possibly have lasted this long.

Unfortunately, the treasures in their possession were not Heavenly Venerate Tools, after all. There would ultimately come a time when they would be exhausted completely, and then they would be overwhelmed by the battle prowess of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

“What are you looking at? Move!” one of them shouted. If it had not been to help Ling Han come in, they would not have had to release such powerful attacks, which meant that they were now extremely strained.

This man’s name was Du Ba.

Ling Han chuckled. “You should be more polite to your savior.”

Savior?

Du Ba was close to madness. As Ling Han arrived, he brought over 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with him, causing the pressure on them to multiply a good many times over. What kind of savior was this?

Yet A’mu’s heart jolted. “You’ve encountered Du Shiyi?”
