Chapter 3574*. Grandmaster of Divination

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Grandmaster, apologies for the disrespect.” The young man hurriedly stood up, and bowed towards Ling Han, “This young master, this humble one’s surname is Niu, and my given name is Jianhua. Grandmaster, since you can tell that this humble one is plagued by bad luck, do you have any way to resolve

it?”

Ling Han pretended to ponder for a moment, trying to whet his appetite. Then, he said, “Forget it. Since we’ve met, it’s fate. I’ll help you gam some insight.” -Many thanks, Grandmaster!” Niu Jianhua was overjoyed. These few days, he was really about to cry from this indescribable bad luck.

At first, he had planned to go to the Imperial Capital for a trip, but in the end, his mood was completely ruined by all the unfortunate events that had happened on his way there. Though he had still gone, with a beauty in his arms, he did not feel anything at all. In the end, he even received that strange look from her, as if she was saying, ‘If you don’t have that kind of ability, why did you come to the brothel?’

This hurt a man’s heart too much.

Thus, he definitely had to drive away this bad luck, at any expense.

Ling Han was counting on his fingers, looking unfathomable, but in the eyes of the four old men, they felt that Ling Han was just putting on an act.

After a while, Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Strange, truly strange! Going by the divination image, I actually managed to predict that you are not from this place! Sigh, looks like I am still not skilled enough. If you are not from this place, could it be that you are a ghost? Hehe, Young Master Niu, I am really sorry for the boast earlier.”

But when these words were said, Niu Jianhua and the four old geezers all gaped widely, looking like they had seen a ghost.

Wasn’t it? He could actually predict that they were not from this place!

-If Ling Han admitted frankly that they were visitors from another planet, they would instead become suspicious. Perhaps, Ling Han was that sneaky thief.

However, Ling Han’s expression now was as if he had made a mistake, and this instead caused these five people to believe him without a doubt. This guy really grasped the skill of divination.

This was an elite; he was too skilled.

Niu Jianhua hurriedly tried to persuade him, and said, “Grandmaster,

Grandmaster, it is not that you are not skilled enough in your studies. You have really calculated correctly.”

Ling Han was instantly “shocked”, and retreated continuously, “You guys, are you really ghosts?”

“How could we possibly be ghosts!” An old man immediately said with a dark expression, “If you continue to spout nonsense, I will pluck out your tongue.” F***, to say that they were ghosts right in front of their faces, how could he insult others like that?

Niu Jianhua glared angrily at the old man, “Shut up. If you don’t speak, no one will think you are mute!”

The old man wanted to refute or explain, but when he saw Niu Jianhua’s baleful expression, he forcibly swallowed the words that were at the tip of his tongue. Niu Jianhua looked towards Ling Han, and said, “A servant does not know the rules. Grandmaster, please do not lower yourself to his level.

“You ghosts, after you’re dead, you still think distinguish the noble and lowly?” Ling Han was still spouting nonsense, infuriating the four old geezers so much that they blew their beards and glared at him. You’re the ghost here, your whole family are ghosts.

Niu Jianhua laughed loudly: but a moth suddenly pounced into his mouth, causing his laughter to stop abruptly as if someone had suddenly slashed him. He coughed repeatedly, but that moth could not be spit out no matter what.

Could he not be so unlucky?

-Grandmaster , we are not ghosts, but have come from another planet. That is why you managed to predict that we are not from this place,” he explained in a raspy voice, fearing that Ling Han would be scared to death.

Only then did Ling Han become “suspicious”, “Is that true?”

—I really admire myself. My acting skills are too amazing.

Niu Jianhua nodded, “Of course it is.”

“You’re talking about the people who live on those stars in the legends? Ling

Han pointed at the sky.

“Of course!” Niu Jianhua regained some of his pride, and said, crossing his arms over his chest.

Ling Han shook his head repeatedly, and said, “You people are indeed ghosts. How can such a small star possibly accommodate people?!” He put on an innocent expression.

“I’m not lying to you. The stars are so small because they’re too far away,” Niu Jianhua explained, feeling an indescribable gloom in his heart. If it was not for the sake of expelling bad luck for himself, he wanted to smack Ling Han to death. This country bumpkin was really foolish, “We come from the Hundred Victory Planet, a great planet of cultivation,, and the ancestor of our Niu Clan is an elder of the Star Dragon Sect, a Spirit Transformation True Lord!

Oh, Ling Han nodded internally. He had finally uncovered the origins of these people.

He still appeared doubtful, “Is it really another star?

“Of course!” Niu Jianhua nodded, then said impatiently, “Grandmaster Ling, do you have a way to get rid of my bad luck?”

Ling Han pinched his fingers and mumbled for a while, then said, “I can’t immediately resolve your bad luck, but I can use a technique to help you get out of this dilemma as soon as possible.”

Though Niu Jianhua was slightly disappointed, he still looked pleased, and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble Grandmaster.”

Ling Han mumbled something under his breath, and observed the large bump on the back of Niu Jianhua’s head. After a while, he said, “I have already gathered all your bad luck into this large bump. It will disappear as the bump dissipates, so there is no need for you to worry.”

Was this real?

Though Niu Jianhua was a little desperate, he was not an idiot, after all. He looked at Ling Han doubtfully. He had recovered with just a few moves?

Why did it feel like this guy was outright lying?

“According to my observations, this big bump will disappear in about two to three days. If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try,” Ling Han said with a smile.

—Previously, when he had moved, he was afraid of killing him, so he had not used too much force. Niu Jianhua naturally recovered very quickly.

Thankfully, he had encountered Ling Han at this time. If it had been two days later, the swelling would have dissipated, and the Yin Qi of the broken piece of the tombstone would naturally have dissipated as well. What other bad luck would there be?

“Then please stay by my side these two days, Grandmaster. If there is any sudden change, Grandmaster Grandmaster would also be able to move in time,” Niu Jianhua said calmly. He had already made his decision. If it was really as Ling Han had said, that he would get rid of his bad luck in two or three days, then he would definitely treat Ling Han as an esteemed guest.

But if Ling Han was lying to him, humph, then he would become hostile and merciless, and let Ling Han know what it meant to be in so much pain that he wanted to die.

Ling Han looked at the four old geezers’ fierce expressions, and said with a shrug, “Looks like I don’t have any other choice?”

“It’s good that Grandmaster understands.” Niu Jianhua nodded.

At night, they rested. Early in the morning of the second day, Ling Han woke up early to welcome the rising sun to cultivate. Because he was just a sliver away from the peak stage of Seven Inscriptions, he was done in less than ten minutes.

When the four old men saw this, they all showed expressions of disdain.

This was really a country bumpkin from a remote and desolate place. He was only dabbling in cultivation, and actually wasted such a rare amount of cultivation time.

If it was not for the fact that they were trapped by the barrier of cultivation level, and could not advance any further, they would definitely be cultivating in earnest at this moment.

In the eyes of these guests from another star, Ling Han’s image naturally became much weaker.

After breakfast, they continued on their way. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yi, are you guys also going to the Primordial Sect?” Ling Han asked, pretending to be curious.

Niu Jianhua laughed in spite of himself, “Also? Could it be that you want to participate in the martial arts competition?

What a joke, this kind of weakling.

Ling Han nodded, “Of course. I am aiming for the first place.”

Pu, Niu Jianhua and the others all laughed loudly..
