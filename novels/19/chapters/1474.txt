Chapter 1475 Resolution

What, Ren Feiyun was going to make a move?

He was at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, and was who knew how many thousand times stronger than the 13 elites previously! If he moved, that would definitely be a completely one-sided obliteration. Even if Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing were in their prime, even if their number was a hundred times over, they would not be able to sustain a single blow from him.

Initially, there were a few Eternal River Tier elites planning to make a move, but when they saw Ren Feiyun appear, they all dismissed that idea.

A big shot had appeared, so what need was there for others to interfere?

Ling Han’s figure wavered. He was really at the end of his rope. He did not have Rising From The Ashes, and did not have the Indestructible True Fluid to instantly heal his injuries, so all the injuries he suffered were real.

He was defiant; he was unyielding. He wanted to fight to the end.

Ren Feiyun smiled slightly, and said, “Don’t worry, I am not here to battle with you two. It is not my style to use my strength to bully others.” He swept an eye over the gathered masses, and continued, “This ends here.”

What, Ren Feiyun was actually not here to suppress Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing, and instead was here to help the two of them!?

This... was unimaginable!

Still, a big shot had appeared, so even if the others were dissatisfied, so what? Did they dare to say anything in disagreement?

There were only a mere four of such big shots the likes of Ren Feiyun in the whole eighth campus, and every single one of them was an overlord that could look down proudly on the rest of the world.

“Ren Feiyun, do you want to break the tradition?” A slow voice rang out, and a figure appeared out of thin air. It was a middle-aged man, and there was actually a silvery fish fin growing out of his back. His hands were also webbed, and it could be confirmed that he was a Demonic Beast that had taken human form, his original form being a fish.

“It’s Senior Brother Cai!”

“Cai Miao, Senior Brother Cai!”

Everyone exclaimed. This was another big shot, a peer of Ren Feiyun. Furthermore, he had entered into the Martial Arts Academy at an even earlier time. His seniority was higher than even that of a great many of their teachers, and he had strong abilities. It could be claimed that aside from the Tranquil Heart Saint, no one could control him at all.

“Traditions can vary for different individuals. Naturally, they can also be abolished for different individuals,” Ren Feiyun said calmly, though there was a powerful determination penetrating through his tone.

“Oh, are you still bearing a grudge against me for forcing you to squeeze into the dog’s hole those years ago?” Cai Miao said, his voice low, but his words were piercingly painful.

Though they were both big shots now, Cai Miao had entered the Academy earlier than Ren Feiyun, and when Ren Feiyun had come here as a new student, it was precisely Cai Miao playing host, delivering a sharp, direct blow right at the prodigies of that time, ripping their pride to absolute pieces.

Thus, there was actually lingering animosity between the two great big shots.

Ren Feiyun was still calm and unperturbed. “At the time, my abilities were inadequate, and I could not resist. However, this time... hehe, if you want to make these two yield, you have to go through me first.”

“Old Four Ren, you have gone too far!” Another big shot appeared. He had a tough and stocky build, and was actually three meters tall. He truly had the head of a tiger. When he spoke, he spat out heavenly bodies as if he could swallow the moons and stars just by opening his mouth.

This was the oldest big shot in the eighth campus. He was not a Demonic Beast, but was rather a unique creature birthed by the heaven and earth, yet none knew what kind of creature he actually was even till today.

This person’s name was “Qi”. Because it was difficult to address him by only a single word, after he entered into the eighth campus, he was gifted a name by the Tranquil Heart Saint, and was called Qi Tian.

Anyways, he was very strong, extremely strong.

And now, two big shots had appeared in opposition of Ren Feiyun.

Ren Feiyun was unafraid. Since he had made his choice, he naturally knew what he would be facing. He was still calm, and said, “I have gone too far? I have not gone too far, I have only moved on. What need is there to inflict the humiliation I have previously suffered on every generation of new students? Let us just do away with such rules!”

“Nonsense!” Qi Tian uttered coldly. “Not even the Saints have ever objected to this rule, so what right do you have to doubt the existence of this rule!”

“Get lost!” Cai Miao rebuked. The relations between himself and Ren Feiyun had always been poor, and now, he did not have anything polite left to say.

The last big shot did not appear. She was the only female among the four great big shots. Her name was Yu Susu, and her achievements in the field of formations were the highest. She was also the one who was the most favored by the Tranquil Heart Saint, who had implied that he wanted to pass on his teachings to her.

Then, in Yu Susu’s absence, two against one, Ren Feiyun was still at an absolute disadvantage.

Ren Feiyun shook his right hand, incredibly confident and at ease. “Then let’s settle this with a battle!”

He had also expressed his determination to be absolutely unyielding.

“Ren Feiyun, you are too arrogant!” Cai Miao moved, and shot out a palm strike. Boom, dark clouds rolled out in the skies, and a heavy downpour descended. And the frightening thing was that the rainwater was filled with corrosive effects. Should anyone stand under this rain, wounds would definitely appear on his body, and even a defense of Origin Power was unable to stop it.

This was the strength of the big shots. If I were to cover the skies, all would be dark and without light.

Ren Feiyun delivered a palm strike as well. His fingers flowed, and billions of formation patterns flickered.

Boom!

The two great big shots exchanged a blow, and even the whole Academy shook. Even if there were protective formations carved by the Saint, the Academy almost collapsed.

“Humph!” Qi Tian also moved, and worked together with Cai Miao to suppress Ren Feiyun.

The rules of the Academy could not be broken, and it could not start from their eighth campus, either!

The three big shots fought fiercely. The others did not even have the qualification to interfere. If a single shock wave swept over them, it was enough to make an elite in the high extreme of Eternal River Tier throw up blood.

Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing both stepped back. Their fighting spirit blazed, and there was a powerful rage in their hearts.

They had not trifled with anyone, yet were forced to climb into a dog’s hole. If they resisted? They would be suppressed!

‘Why?

‘Why did I have to suffer such humiliation?’

The two of them were both incredibly proud people, and would rather die than bend to the will of others!

If they were really no match for them, they would rather turn around and leave, and withdraw from the Martial Arts Academy.

And now, when they saw Ren Feiyun fight for their sake, they were both touched and furious, and also felt a powerful sullenness.

The three big shots engaged in an earth-shattering battle royale.

“Stop!” A soft exclamation was heard, yet brought with it a supreme air of might and dignity.

Boom, the battle between the three big shots came to a sudden and abrupt halt. In the face of this voice, even if they joined forces, they were still unqualified to resist.

Because this was the Tranquil Heart Saint!

Previously, it had only been a small-scale conflict, so the Tranquil Heart Saint could overlook it, but now that the three great big shots were in a mighty battle, he could no longer ignore this. If they were really allowed to continue fighting, even the eighth campus could possibly be razed to the ground.

“We accept the Saintly Decree!” everyone exclaimed with reverence.

Saints were aloof and remote, and could create a world with a single thought, or destroy a world with a single thought. They could not be disrespected in the slightest.

“Step down, all of you!” the Tranquil Heart Saint said calmly, but this was a conclusion to today’s matter.

They were not allowed to make any further noise, or it would be equivalent to disobeying the Saintly Decree.

“Yes!” everyone replied with another bow, and retreated respectively.

However, before he left, Cai Miao cast an eye on Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing, and said, “Old Four Ren, you can protect them for a while, but will not be able to protect them their whole lives! It is impossible that the rules of the Academy will be broken for you, and will not be possibly broken for them, either!”

After he said this, he left proudly, and did not take Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing’s reactions to heart at all. In his eyes, the two of them were ants in the first place, so what need was there for him to be concerned about them?

Empress Luan Xing was supporting Ling Han, and Ling Han had practically lost all his strength, weakly leaning on the empress, and allowing her to help him enter the great doors. He turned around to look at the dog’s hole, his eyes menacing.

He would remember this grudge!

Then, his eyelids became heavy, and he soon passed out.

When he came back to consciousness, he saw that he was already lying on a bed. The majority of his injuries had healed. Even without him actively channelling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, it still had a very strong healing effect.

“You’ve woken up,” the empress said as she entered the room, a beautiful smile on her face.
