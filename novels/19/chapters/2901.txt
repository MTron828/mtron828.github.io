2902 Successful deduction

This was not impossible, because Ling Han already had the seal before and the seal after in the sequence, and he could use their resonance to deduce the middle one—deducing Heavenly Venerable Seals was a compulsory course for elites with cultivation level of Third Tier or higher, but if he imagined it without any reference, it would be too difficult to accomplish.

The level of difficulty currently experienced by Ling Han was much lower. Furthermore, he also had the experience in repairing Heavenly Venerable Seals. The might of millions and millions of Powers of Dimension within his body was definitely more beneficial than what other Heavenly Venerates had.

However, before Ling Han went into seclusion, he had also heard quite a bit of news, such as that the grandmasters of raw stone had suffered retribution, given that revenge was a dish best served cold. A large number of grandmasters of raw stone had been killed, and the reason was that they had been too arrogant previously.

Currently, grandmasters of raw stone were trash, so which Heavenly Venerate would still care?

In the past, you actually dared to show your dissatisfaction to the Heavenly Venerates, and in fact even ordered them around?

Had you no idea what kind of existence a Heavenly Venerate was? Even the heavens had to respect them.

With the exception of a crafty old fox like Grandmaster Xuanlai, who knew how to conduct himself, and was still living very comfortably, the group of raw stone grandmasters had suffered a huge blow. Their rise to fame had been sudden, and their fall was also shockingly fast.

In the end, relying on others to raise one’s status wasn’t reliable. Only one’s own strength would truly matter.

Ling Han shook his head, and did not take it to heart. He began his seclusion.

He observed his mind and activated the Powers of Dimension in his body. The two series of Heavenly Venerable Seals glowed, and there was a faint connection between them.

One set was ninth-grade seals, while the other set was eighth-grade seals. There was only a single seal missing in the middle to completely connect them together. This was the first thing Ling Han deduced. If he could produce this seal, then how terrifying would his boosted power be with that set of ninth-grade seals and nearly one-third of the set of eighth-grade seals?

Weng, weng, weng, the infinite Powers of Dimension within his body shone, causing his mind to seemingly have become the Void, illuminating the heavens.

Streams of Primal Chaos Qi gushed out from every cell, and turned into a vast ocean around him. Every strand of Primal Chaos Qi was extremely heavy. If not for Ling Han’s existence, a single strand of Primal Chaos Qi would be able to destroy a low-level dimension.

Ling Han’s mind was empty, but his enlightenment was as resplendent as fireworks. It made him feel as if he could see the birth and development of the entire Genesis World. The six fundamental powers were the foundation—they were everything, and the Heavenly Venerable Seals were a tool that could communicate with the fundamental powers.

It was unknown how many years had passed when Ling Han’s body trembled, and he suddenly opened his eyes. There were no whites in his eyes, nor were there any black pupils. There was only an expanse of Primal Chaos, exuding a strange aura.

It was not Heavenly Venerable Tier, but it was definitely not weaker than the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

He jolted again and woke up from this strange state. A joyous expression appeared on his face.

He had finally deduced the first eighth-grade seal, and it radiated within his mind.

‘Come, my super combination seals.’

Weng, 144 symbols were channeled at the same time. At first, Ling Han was filled with anticipation, but a look of bewilderment immediately appeared on his face.

His strength increased by 262 times.

That didn’t seem right.

His eighth-grade combination seals could already increase his strength by 257 times. Then, further connected with the complete ninth-grade combination seals, the increase in power should definitely exceed 300 times.

Why was it so low?

This was because the ninth-grade seals couldn’t be combined with the eighth-grade seals, and it was as if one was just channeling irrelevant Heavenly Venerable Seals; no matter how many there were, only the most powerful Heavenly Venerable Seal could be effective.

In Ling Han’s case, this was the most powerful set of combination seals displaying its might.

This was strange; the Heavenly Venerable Seal he deduced had to be correct. Otherwise, it would be impossible to increase the power of the eighth-grade combination seals. But why couldn’t it be combined with the ninth-grade combination seals? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Could it be that he needed a complete set of eighth-grade combination seals?

Ling Han decided to continue deducing. He only needed two, and they both had adjacent Heavenly Venerable Seals to resonate with, so deducing them was still not too difficult.

He went into seclusion again.

Time flew by, and it was unknown how many years had passed. Ling Han comprehended the second eighth-grade seal, and connected the original two sets of eighth-grade seals together. The increase in power instantly exceeded 400 times.

He didn’t stop, and continued to deduce the last eighth-grade seal.

Time was meaningless to him as once again countless years had passed, and Ling Han awakened for the third time.

Eighth-grade seals, set complete!

‘Come on, come on.’ Ling Han couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation. ‘This time it ought to work, right?’

He channeled all the ninth- and eighth-grade seals. Weng, all 222 Heavenly Venerable Seals lit up in unison. Peng, the secret chamber where he was cultivating in seclusion immediately exploded, and a terrifying power shot into the sky, breaking through the sealed barrier of this dimension and piercing into the Void.

After the passing of so many years, there weren’t many people left here, but there were some people who were still hopeful after all and were exploring. There might still be some raw stones left behind.

However, at this moment, everyone felt a chill in their heart. Looking at the pillar of light soaring into the sky, everyone with cultivation level below the Heavenly Venerable Tier knelt down, and even the Heavenly Venerates themselves felt their hearts race. The seals within their bodies were automatically channeled, cheering excitedly, as if they wanted to submit to that pillar of light.

A complete set of Heavenly Venerable Seals surpassing a first-grade seal was too terrifying.

However, Ling Han was not happy, because he discovered that the two strings of Heavenly Venerable Seals could not display their might at the same time.

His power had increased by an astonishing 999 times, but this was the power of the eighth-grade seals. The ninth-grade seals were completely ineffective.

How strange.

He had already gathered all the eighth-grade seals, so why couldn’t he combine them with the ninth-grade seals?

Was it impossible to combine them at all, or did he have to gather all the Heavenly Venerable Seals before they could take effect?

If it was the former, then there was no need to mention anything else. If it was the latter, then the time required to collect them would be unimaginably long, and in fact, there might never be a day when this goal could be completed.

Ling Han stopped channeling the Heavenly Venerable Seals, and slowly nodded.

Lin Luo had divided all the Heavenly Venerable Seals into nine levels. It seemed that it wasn’t just because of the difference in the increase in power, but also because they had their own characteristics. This was the only way to distinguish them.

See, eighth-grade seals were adjacent to ninth-grade seals. They could resonate and sense each other, but they can’t take effect at the same time.

Ling Han had nothing to be dissatisfied with. He now possessed a complete set of eighth-grade combination seals, and his power could be increased by nearly 1,000 times. This was too terrifying. Even if he were to encounter Xin Qihu again, he was confident that he could fight to his heart’s content.

“Time to go out and take a look.”

When he came out of seclusion, the Empress and the others were already waiting for him, and the time they had been waiting had shockingly reached 30 billion years.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be shocked. He didn’t seem to have spent much time, so how could 30 billion years be gone just like that?

“Let’s return to the Flaming Frost Realm,” the Empress said gently.

“Have the others all returned?” Ling Han asked.

...

“Yes. Second Brother, Jianxue, and the others have already returned.” The Empress nodded. After 30 billion years, her cultivation level had also reached the late stage of the Third Tier, and such speed was already considered fast. After all, there was no longer any supply of Great Herbs.

“Alright, we’ll go back as well.”

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and all the women entered the Celestial Guest Residence. Then, he began to shuttle through the Void.

More than 10 years later, he returned to the Flaming Frost Realm. Immediately, he received a message from Meng Dong.
