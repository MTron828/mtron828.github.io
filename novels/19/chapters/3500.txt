Chapter 3501: Visit of the Third Imperial Prince

Translator: Henyee Translations I Editor: Henyee Translations

Previously, Ling Han could be so fast because he had only been copying the first inscription, so there was no need for him to consider it. Naturally, his “brush strokes” was speedy and skilled.

However, after copying the whole first inscription, he would have to construct new strokes himself.

This stroke was not just a simple sketch, but was completely different from the previous one million strokes, and this stroke was the understanding about heaven and earth, and appreciation of dao.

Ling Han’s cultivation level was so low, and he had even started off at the height of 1,000,000 strokes. Thus, it was truly as difficult as ascending the heavens.

He wracked his brains, but could not think of how he should draw a new stroke. He had indeed drawn a few more strokes, but it was completely ineffective. It was the same as before, so it was equivalent to a waste.

What a headache.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. There were innumerable dimensions in his body, and every dimension was an independent world. Could he learn from this?

His execution ability was incredibly shocking, and he naturally began immediately when he thought of it.

Another stroke.

He used life force as ink, adding a new stroke.

It worked!

Ling Han was overjoyed, because in this world, he was still a rookie, and his understanding of Dao could be considered extremely superficial, but in his inner world, he was the invincible Heavenly Venerate, and his appreciation of Dao had surpassed all else.

In fact, he himself was a world, and he was also the one who decided the Regulations.

Again, again, again.

New strokes were added, and they were all his understanding of great dao. However, just as Ling Han was feeling elated, the improvement of his level of being suddenly slowed down.

There was no more time. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He hurriedly mustered his remaining courage, and seized the last bit of time to inscribe.

Merely three minutes later, this breakthrough was over.

He had inscribed a total of 1,030,000 veined patterns, and they were all different.

Too bad, Ling Han thought. If he had been able to comprehend earlier that he could use his comprehension of the inner worlds as a stroke, he would at least be able to push the number of veined patterns up to 1.1 million.

Next time, he would definitely improve greatly next time.

He looked inside himself, and the two “one” characters reflected each other’s brilliance.

“Thankfully, it’s not two, or it would be too awkward,” Ling Han mocked.

“Father, you have to bring us out to play next time!” The children all ran over complaining that Ling Han hadn’t played with them these two months.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said with a nod, “Sure, sure, sure.”

He rested for a day, then ran to the Foreign Affairs Department.

Even if he and Princess Bixiao weren’t here, the operations here was still very smooth. Hu Er and the others sent out a summons for surrender to all the sects, but there were very few responses. Some were just using a delaying tactic, not willing to surrender, nor did they want to offend the Dark North Nation. Some refused tactfully, and the majority were like stones thrown into the sea, completely ignored.

As the saying goes, resort to courtesy before resorting to force. Previously everyone had been all smiles, without any anger, and did not damage the ’ harmony between them, but now, it was clear that they could not do that.

Ling Han decided to personally pay them a visit. Perhaps, he could raze one or two forces to the ground, and let the other forces take a look that they would not just speak empty words.

Coincidentally, Princess Bixiao also came out of seclusion.

She had not been able to step onto the Celestial Path. This was the gulf between Celestials and mortals. The gulf between the levels of beings was too great so it was very normal that she had not succeeded in just one attempt. After all’ the present heaven and earth environment had not completely returned to normal. However, she should not be too far from success. Even if she had not succeeded, she was still exuding an otherworldly air, like a celestial maiden.

“Y1, you seem to have become a little stronger,” Ling Han said.

Princess Bixiao was proud, and she said, “Although I didn’t succeed in breaking through, I accidentally awakened some of my Primitive Age bloodline. My level of being has still improved to a certain extent. I’ll accumulate some more power, and I’ll definitely succeed next time.”

Ling Han gave her a thumbs up, “As expected of my little dear.”

Princess Bixiao shot out a kick, “What did you say?”

Ling Han raised his hands, and said, “I was just joking.”

Princess Bixiao’s beautiful eyes moved, and suddenly, she smiled beautifully “If you are willing to teach that fist technique to me, I can consider taking you as my husband. After all, you are unmarried, and I am unmarried. With your natural talent in cultivation, you are just barely worthy of me.” Ling Han couldn’t help but wear a strange expression. ‘Who said I’m not married?’

I already have many descendants!

He shook his head with a smile, “Say, Your Highness, could it be that you have gone mad, to actually say such words?”

“Hehe, if you want to court me, show me your sincerity.” Princess Bixiao ignored his teasing.

Ling Han was surprised. Princess Bixiao’s interest in the Demonic Monkey

Fists was even above the Three Styles of the God of War.

Was it because she was also a member of the Monkey Race?

When he recalled that Princess Bixiao had been transformed from a monkey, Ling Han felt an indescribable curiosity. If this princess was completely naked would she also be covered in fur?

Cough, cough, this was really too indecent. No, no.

Ling Han held back from activating his eye technique. Otherwise, just the ordinary clothes that Princess Bixiao was wearing would not be able to block his gaze at all.

“This time, we’re going to the Highest Splendor Sect.” Ling Han took out a map, and tapped his finger strongly on a spot.

Princess Bixiao glanced at him, and said, “Highest Splendor Sect? The sect master of Highest Splendor Sect is a crafty old fox. While replying, he said that he admires the prosperity of our Empire, he also said that the journey is too far, and there are too many forces blocking the way, and they did not manage to overcome them to reach us.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then let’s go personally, and see how this old fox will continue to refuse.”

Princess Bixiao nodded, “Indeed, we should make an example of them, and let those who are waiting and hesitant know that the heavenly authority of our Empire cannot be violated.”

“Then, we’ll set out tomorrow.”

“All right.”

The two of them had just settled on a big matter, when they saw a man run in quickly, and said, “Reporting to the two Department Chiefs, the Third Imperial Prince has arrived.”

Ling Han glanced at Princess Bixiao, and said with a smile, “Take a guess. Is he here to court you, or is he here to ask for a back door?”

Bixiao glared at him, her expression unfriendly.

“Invite him in.” Ling Han nodded at the errand boy.

The Foreign Affairs Department was only accountable to Chen Fengyan alone Though there was no clear official position, their status was transcendent. Thus, Ling Han had absolutely no need to humble himself to those Imperial Princes, and he was not capable of doing such a thing either.

If Chen Fengyan hadn’t elevated the status of the Foreign Affairs Department to such a high level, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t have accepted this job. After all, wouldn’t that just be causing trouble for himself?

In a short while, the errand boy led the Third Imperial Prince into the Main Hall.

“Your Highness, long time no see. Your beauty is even more beautiful than in the past.” The moment the Third Imperial Prince arrived, he tried his best to curry the favour of Princess Bixi.

Princess Bixiao faced him calmly, neither warm nor cold.

After the Third Imperial Prince spoke for a while longer, he finally turned to look at Ling Han. He frowned, and said, “Ling Han, you are really putting on airs. I have come here, and not only have I been left out for a very long time, I even have to come personally to see you!”

“Hehe, do you really think that the surname of this world is Ling?”

‘Tsk, he is attacking just like that?’

Ling Han was presently enjoying the favour of the Emperor, so who would dare offend him? However, the Third Imperial Prince was different. Firstly, he was a noble descendant of the imperial family, and secondly, the matter of Princess Bixiao was also a thorn in his side. Thus, there was absolutely no way that he would treat Ling Han nicely..
