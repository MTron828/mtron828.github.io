Chapter 1422 I Can“t Tolerate This

empress luan xing stood proudly, unafraid even though heavenly tribulation was about to befall her. she merely scanned the surroundings with a baleful expression in her eyes.

point star city had already been conquered, so the totem of the majestic empire had naturally disappeared as well. since she couldn’t detect the power of the nation, she was naturally aware that the chaotic stars majestic empire had already fallen.

however, she couldn’t care less about this.

what she cared about was the people!

the empress’ gaze stopped on ling han. upon seeing his blood-soaked figure and wounded life force, she couldn’t help but feel pained and furious.

needless to say, ling han had definitely participated in the bloody battle and become wounded in order to protect her and prevent her from being disturbed.

moreover, she knew that ling han possessed the black tower, this spatial god tool being his most powerful defense. as long as he hid inside it, even saints wouldn’t be able to find him!

however, for her sake, ling han had resolutely guarded the stone door without retreating.

what more could a woman ask for?

an air of primal chaos shrouded the empress’ face. however, everyone here was a heavenly body tier elite, so who couldn’t see through this thin mask? they... all felt boundless jealousy!

who had ever witnessed the empress gazing at a man with such a pained and caring expression before?

even qu qiuxue and the others cursed in their minds. ling han and ding li’an hadn’t been lying to them! the empress genuinely had a close relationship with ling han! however, the question was, how had they developed this relationship? one had to realize that the empress and ling han had only met each other less than 10 times.

however, little did they know that the empress was a member of the nine snake tribe, meaning that she could separate nine clones from her main body. one of them had already become acquainted with ling han long ago. moreover, in the end, the empress had even been locked together with ling han and almost been forced to copulate with him. in fact, she had almost reverse-raped ling han.

the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor naturally saw empress luan xing’s shifting expression as well. rage instantly welled up inside them. this was a rage 10 times more intense than they had ever experienced before. no, 100 times, 1000 times, 10,000 times!!!

they had already felt uneasy when hearing ling han refer to empress luan xing as his wife before, yet upon thinking of the empress’ personality and demeanor, they had concluded that ling han was merely experiencing unrequited love. after all, how could such an aloof and noble empress fall for a man?

even if she did fall for a man, it should have been them.

however, reality gave them a shocking slap across the face. that caring and loving look instantly shattered their hearts. no, even their balls were shattered...

however, how could rulers such as them have glass hearts? their disappointment quickly transformed into a raging killing intent.

‘so what if you have feelings for him? as long as i kill him and capture you, we can slowly make love and cultivate your feeling for me.

‘kill, kill, kill! i must kill that young man!’

the two emperors were boiling with killing intent. although they had gone all out in an attempt to kill ling han just then, they had only done so out of fear of ling han’s frightening potential. now, however, their killing intent was born out of jealousy. even if ling han were a defenseless weakling, they would still do everything in their abilities to kill him.

boom!

they resolutely attacked, not holding back even though the empress was already present.

the reason for this was simple. heavenly tribulation was about to descend, so how could empress luan xing help ling han? even if she successfully overcame heavenly tribulation, that would already be half a day later. at that time, ling han would already be an ice-cold corpse.

“you’re seeking death!” empress luan xing roared. she stared daggers at the two emperors, killing intent exploding from her body.

she waved her right hand.

boom!

the four heavenly bodies behind her started to undulate. these four heavenly bodies were no different from those at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier, yet the aura that emanated from her was 100 times—perhaps even 1000 times—more powerful than that of the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor.

‘heavens! the two emperors have already reached the peak stage of the heavenly body tier, so how can she be so much more powerful than them?’

peng! peng!

the two emperors were sent flying back in unison, their faces as white as a sheet and clouds of blood exploding from their bodies.

“are you okay?” however, empress luan xing didn’t so much as glance at them, her eyes remaining fixed on ling han the entire time. there was a pained expression on her exquisitely beautiful face.

‘f*ck! f*ck! f*ck!’

qu qiuxue and the others could barely believe their eyes. meanwhile, the elites of the eternity sky majestic empire and jade drop majestic empire were all going wild with jealousy. who hadn’t heard of the empress’ beauty before? now that they had witnessed her beauty, they realized that she was even more beautiful than words could describe. after all, their imaginations of her beauty hadn’t even reached one-ten-thousandth of her true beauty!

however, such a stunning beauty was actually expressing care for another man? her caring expression was enough to make them go crazy!

‘that brat... he’ll die a wretched death!

‘however, how is empress luan xing so powerful? she’s far too powerful!’

ling han smiled, and replied, “everything’s okay as long as you’re okay.”

‘f*ck! you’re still being lovey-dovey?! are you not afraid of being killed sooner?’

the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor had already been tremendously jealous. upon seeing this show of tender love, it was instantly as if this jealousy had been further rubbed into their faces. this was truly a horrible feeling. already severely wounded, they couldn’t help but instantly vomit mouthfuls of blood upon being stabbed in the heart like this.

empress luan xing nodded, and said, “those who hurt you... i’ll make them pay a heavy price!”

ling han nodded in reply. after empress luan xing advanced to the pinnacle level, he was confident that she would be invincible, at least within this galaxy. thus, he naturally didn’t need to tell her to be careful and such.

meanwhile, qu qiuxue and the others lamented in their minds. ’empress, can’t you see us? you can’t only have an eye for him! at least give us a fleeting glance and thank us for our hard work, please?’

however, if the empress acted as such, would she still be the empress?

kuang!

at this moment, a bolt of lightning arced down, directly striking at empress luan xing’s head.

the empress casually raised a hand.

pa!

the bolt of lightning was forcefully crushed into oblivion.

‘f*ck! are my eyes deceiving me?

‘that’s heavenly tribulation! yet, she can crush it with a single strike? is she still human?’ Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

however, ling han’s eyes instantly lit up. empress luan xing definitely wasn’t advancing to just the early stage of the pinnacle level. rather... she was advancing to the peak stage of the pinnacle level!

how could one reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level in one step?

this was naturally as a result of her nine clones. while others could only advance once, she would be advancing 10 times. as such, was it surprising that she was advancing to the peak stage of the pinnacle level in one step?

right now, she possessed a power that was equivalent to the early stage of the low extreme of the eternal river tier. that being the case, wouldn’t facing heavenly tribulation at the early stage of the pinnacle level be a walk in the park? her strength was already 1000 times more powerful!

kuang! kuang! kuang!

divine lightning continued to descend, one bolt after another. this was incredibly terrifying, yet more terrifying than this was empress luan xing. using her fists, she easily shattered every single bolt of divine lightning.

the elites all became numb with shock, cold chills shooting down their spines.

they had never seen someone overcome heavenly tribulation so easily before—of course, this was because they had never seen ling han facing heavenly tribulation. if he didn’t use tribulation to temper his godly bones, they would be nothing more than a light massage to him.

“you people invaded my territory. this, i can allow!

“you people slaughtered my citizens. this, i can endure!

“however, you people actually attempted to hurt him! this, i can’t tolerate!”

empress luan xing was bathed in divine lightning as she said this, yet she slowly walked toward the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor, ice-cold killing intent on her beautiful face.

whom was she kidding? she could tolerate people invading her territory and killing her citizens? however, what did the empress’ comparison highlight?

ling han... he was more important than her territory and citizens!

these words were torture for the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor. meanwhile, qu qiuxue and the others all wore extremely strange expressions. they had fought to the death, yet they were nothing in the eyes of the empress!

they had all shed blood for the majestic empire, so why did only ling han receive care from the empress?

sigh!

‘by saying this, aren’t you afraid of bringing grief to your citizens? oh, that’s right, the chaotic stars majestic empire has already ceased to exist...’
