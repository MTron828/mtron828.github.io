Chapter 755: Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

Ling Han’s thoughts raced as he said, “Might I ask what senior is called?”

Zi , the stone statue’s lighting flickered and shot towards Ling Han.

“Junior, I’ll teach you a lesson first to let you know that you should respect your seniors!” the voice said.

Ling Han greeted it with a punch and activated the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, fighting lightning with lightning.

Zi, zi, zi , the lightning burst, its dazzling light interweaving.

Pa , Ling Han was sent flying and hit the wall hard, and then bounced back. This was surprising, as the impact was of the Heaven Tier, but there was no trace on the wall, which showed its firmness.

“Hm?” the voice uttered in surprise. “Junior, you’re quite strange. You’re obviously just in the Deity Transformation Tier, but your battle prowess reached the Heaven Tier, and your physique also reached this level. Tsk, tsk, this is very rare, even in... it’s also very rare!”

Very rare?

Ling Han was shocked. Very rare meant that someone else could also reach such heights.

Who was this mysterious being... at least, the Earth Dragon Sect specialized in physical arts, and Jia Ming was a genius that was hard to come by in ten millennia, claiming to have the highest ancestral blood, but his physique was only comparable to same tier rare metal, which was far from rivaling Ling Han’s.

“And this little girl!” The voice paused slightly. “To be able to withstand the aftershock of the battle as if nothing had happened is absolutely inconceivable! Strange, strange, a mayfly realm can actually produce such geniuses?”

“Senior, what’s the meaning of a mayfly realm?” Ling Han asked.

“Obviously it’s your extremely tiny world,” the voice said. “This Lord is Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire—remember This Lord’s feared name, it’s the strongest in the world!”

Ling Han scoffed inwardly. Weren’t you maimed, then escaped here, suppressed by someone? Or else, why would he need to search for some treasure? The world’s strongest? Keep boasting! However, his expression was unchanged as he said, “So, it’s Senior Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, may I ask why our place is a mayfly realm?”

“Without even real stars, suns, and moons, what is it if not a mayfly realm?” Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire sneered. “Alright, less superfluous talk, hurry up and find the treasure for This Lord. As for this little girl, leave her. This Lord will take her as a disciple!”

“Pah, Niu doesn’t want to!” Hu Niu made a face.

“This Lord is really strong! No, This Lord is the strongest, so acknowledge This Lord as master. There are great benefits!” It was like Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was fooling a child.

Thunder and fire!

Ling Han clearly understood. The lightning river and fire river outside were produced by Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, and judging from this point, Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was indeed very strong, at least able to rival the Shattering Void Tier. Moreover, judging from his tone, he was obviously not a person of the vast lands.

An almighty being in the divine realm? No wonder he talked so big.

“Trapped here, relying on a broken stone statue to talk, how strong can you be?” Hu Niu said disdainfully.

“Wayaya!” Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was greatly infuriated, his furious divine sense interweaving and lasting for a long time. After a long while, he finally said, “This Lord will recover previous strength someday, and when the time comes, This Lord will kill all elites of the highest heavens, and all will prostrate in worship at the feet This Lord!”

Ling Han interrupted, “Senior can perhaps tell us about the divine realm?”

“Divine realm? Hahahaha!” Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire laughed loudly and sneered. “Why should This Lord tell you? Youngster, bring these treasures here, and This Lord will tell you everything you want to know!”

“To ask for some treasures in exchange for a few questions, Senior really doesn’t know how to do business. Not doing it!” Ling Han refused at once, paused shortly, and said, “However, I might as well listen. What treasures does senior need?”

Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was irritated. A mere Deity Transformation Tier junior dared to bargain with him? But, unfortunately, he was the one who needed a favor, was he not? He snorted, and said, “This Lord needs these four things: True Dragon’s Horn, Heavenly Phoenix Feather, Crimson Spirit Blood, Purple Valley Divine Metal!”

Pah!

The corner of Ling Han’s mouth twitched. Why don’t you steal them...

Which of those four things weren’t the world’s finest divine items? The key was that would the vast lands even have these divine items?

Take True Dragon’s Horn for example—although Helian Xunxue was a descendant of True Dragons, she only had a shred of their bloodline and was infinitely far from True Dragons. Even the master of the four seas, the royal Ao Family only had somewhat richer bloodline, which was still infinitely far away from a True Dragon’s.

The three other things were all no inferior. Not to mention that Ling Han was just a small Deity Transformation Tier warrior, even Shattering Void Tier elites had no way to obtain them. So, first, he couldn’t win, and second, he couldn’t find it!

“Hehe, This Lord’s not asking you to find it immediately. It couldn’t possibly be found in this desolate place. However, when you go to the divine realm in the future, you’ll have the chance to obtain it. This lord will wait for you,” Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire went on.

No kidding, looks impossible to leave the way you look. Could you go for a stroll if not wait?

Ling Han laughed mischievously, and said, “Then what exceptional Mystical Power will senior reward me with?” If this Mystical Power was really kickass, then after he obtained those divine items, he really could consider doing this business.

“This lord will send you a sliver of divine sense, and let you see the Mystical Power’s power,” Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire said. Xiu , a small luminous spot flew out from the stone statue and stopped before Ling Han.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless. Carefully observing it for a while and making sure that it was indeed containing a memory, he finally extended his finger and pressed at it. Weng , inside his consciousness, a scene of battle immediately appeared.

A man whose face couldn’t be seen clearly was engaged in a fierce battle. His opponent was a sword user, whose sword lights were piercing and extremely terrifying.

Their countenances couldn’t be seen clearly because of a layer of mist around them, but Ling Han had a feeling that Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was this person, and not the sword user.

Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire suddenly unleashed his might. Four arms actually grew out of his body as if he’d turned into an octopus. The six arms activated mystic arts at the same time as if he’d turned into three people.

Ling Han was astonished. Although he also grasped many Mystical Powers and mystic arts, at least, Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow and Earth Overturning Seal couldn’t be executed simultaneously. However, if he could have four more arms, it would be completely different.

Six arms moved and activated five mystic arts at once, instantly suppressing that swordsman.

“How is it, this is Immovable Deity Metal Body Mystical Power. This is only the first tier, and cultivating further, the entire body can also enlarge, and the power of a swipe would be unstoppable!” Thunder Fire Heavenly Emperor said with an enticing tone. “This Lord spent tremendous effort and almost died in a historic site to find this exceptional Mystical Power!

“Want to learn it? If you want to learn it, then bring those four divine items, and This Lord will teach you!”

Learn it? He very much wanted to learn it!

Even if it was only the first tier that transformed the body into one of six arms, it was still extremely practical. Being able to unleash many Mystical Powers simultaneously, its value... was too great!

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Okay, I’ll do my best to find those four divine items! But, Senior, my current strength is too weak. Can you impart some divine art first to increase my chances, or else, if I really die, it’ll also be a loss for Senior, right?”

It was rare to meet such a powerful existence, so the benefits obviously had to be taken.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
