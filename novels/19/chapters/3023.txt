3024 Going to cause trouble

The five ultimate elites of Seventh Tier were giving up their responsibilities?

When Ling Han found out about this, his first reaction was naturally disbelief. The survival of this Genesis World was related to every single person. So what if they were as strong as Seventh Tier? Without the heaven and earth and universe, even if they never died, so what?

Moreover, it was extremely likely that Hysteria would possess the ability to kill Seventh Tiers after devouring the entire Genesis World.

The destruction of the Genesis World from the last era had torn Extermination into pieces, and the spirit of a Seventh Tier ultimate elite had been destroyed as well.

Then, after engulfing the Genesis World, Hysteria would definitely possess this ability as well.

How could Seventh Tiers be safe?

How could Chong Yan and the others not have thought of this? They actually left the Realm Battlefield “willfully.” Wasn’t this allowing Hysteria to advance even faster?

Could it be that because Feng Wuding had died, they had given up on themselves because they thought that no one could deal with Hysteria?

The possibility of this was too small.

Being able to advance to the Seventh Tier, which of them wasn’t a person with a firm willpower? As long as it was not yet the moment of true death, no matter how hopeless they were, they would still fight to the end.

Moreover, as long as the Genesis World wasn’t destroyed, perhaps a true savior would emerge?

This was far too strange. Ling Han couldn’t accept this.

Then, did the five ultimate elites have other plans?

Had they joined Hysteria?

This didn’t seem like it. What benefits could there be from cooperating with Hysteria? Moreover, if Chong Yan and the others had really leaned towards Hysteria, they should have restrained Lin Luo and the others. Why had they only retreated out of the Realm Battlefield?

There was something strange about this.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. The five ultimate elites had exited the Realm Battlefield, so could Hysteria’s advance still be stopped? How was the situation in the main battlefield right now?

If the main body of Hysteria couldn’t be stopped, and they merely relied on the Profound Negative Realm’s own power as resistance, then at most tens of thousands of years later, not even an epoch, the realm would definitely fall. This would also mean the death of the entire Genesis World.

Ling Han’s first reaction was to head to the main battlefield to battle Hysteria, but he immediately dismissed this kind of impulse.

He couldn’t, he was still only a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate. Without a true undying and indestructible body, wouldn’t he just be going to the main battlefield to die?

No matter what, he had to advance to the Sixth Tier and further improve his defense. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to withstand even a single blow from Hysteria. That was practically a joke.

But how was Ling Han supposed to advance into Sixth Tier as soon as possible?

En, since Chong Yan and his group had returned, shouldn’t he go and “play” with them?

Previously, it had been these five people that kept causing him trouble. Now, it should be his turn to take the initiative.

Although he wasn’t truly undying and indestructible now, only Hysteria could penetrate his defenses. As for others, even Seventh Tiers would only be dumbfounded, and there was no reason for him to be afraid of them.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before deciding to wait.

If he just charged over like this, it would be the result of “you being unable to wound me, and I would not be able to wound you, either.” At most, it would only be a verbal battle, and that would not be very interesting.

But now that the five ultimate elites had returned, would they not establish their own force? Would they just stay on their lonesome?

Ling Han did not believe that Chong Yan and the others would be so pure-minded with such scant desires. If that was really the case, then he could only accept it and seek them out for a fight.

Thus, he sat down again, and waited to see if there would be any changes.

After all, it was only a rumor that the five ultimate elites had withdrawn from the Realm Battlefield. It hadn’t been confirmed yet.

Ling Han continued to deduce the Heavenly Venerable Seals. As usual, every time he deduced a new seal, he would come out to walk around, move around, and “communicate” with the women.

In a flash, 1,000,000 years had passed.

It was no longer a rumor that the five ultimate elites had exited the Realm Battlefield. Instead, it was a fact. This caused a commotion among the higher-ups. In fact, there were even some who expressed fear for their own safety.

Some forces had already begun packing up and leaving. They were going to go through the passageway of the two realms, to the other end of the Genesis World. Then, even if Hysteria really devoured the Genesis World, they would definitely be the last to die.

Ling Han shook his head. Traversing between dimensions was no joke. There were some places where energy storms lay, and only those who were Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tiers or Heavenly Venerable Tiers could pass through. Furthermore, there were countless dimensions, and it was unknown how long it would take to reach the other end.

In any case, this was none of Ling Han’s business.

He had found out that Chong Yan and the others had indeed established their own respective places of enlightenment, and actually began taking disciples.

This caused Ling Han to be at a loss.

It wasn’t like Hysteria had been destroyed, and the world had become peaceful. So, why were Chong Yan and the others so relaxed?

Had their heads been kicked by a donkey? They were actually establishing places of enlightenment and taking in disciples?

Ling Han pondered for a moment before deciding to set off immediately to visit their places of enlightenment. Firstly, he wanted to see what was going on, and secondly, he wanted to know what the five of them were planning.

There was something strange about this. Something very strange.

After some thought, he decided to delay it for tens of thousands of years. That was because he had already deduced 110 sixth-grade seals, and was only one away from deducing the whole set.

Ling Han continued to cultivate in seclusion, communicating with the heaven and earth, connecting with the Void, and grasping the power of life. Though he had only managed to grasp it superficially, the speed at which he deduced Heavenly Venerable Seals was considerably faster now.

Ling Han’s mind continuously experienced enlightenment, as if it had been reborn.

Another 30,000 years passed, and he came out of seclusion.

Success.

With a thought from him, the 111 sixth-grade seals were channeled, instantly increasing his power by 3000 times.

Ling Han entered into the Void, and shot out a punch. Boom! The Void trembled, and a vacuum as long as 5000 km was instantly created in the energy storm in front of him. After a long while, the energy storm started moving again, filling up this area.

“Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, if the five of you don’t master a few more first-grade seals, I’m afraid you can only be suppressed by me.”

When they found out that Ling Han was going to move, everyone was overjoyed, expressing their desire to go with him to “play.”

Ling Han was rendered speechless. He was not going to play. The place of enlightenment of five ultimate elites was no place to play around in, right? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, it had really been a long time since he had brought everyone traveling with him.

Forget it. He brought everyone with him, and took them all into the Celestial Guest Residence. Then, they set out.

There was no need to rush. Every time they reached a new place, they would stop for a sightseeing tour. Thus, after 17 years, Ling Han finally arrived at the place of enlightenment of Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

This place was called Shatter Mountains’s place of enlightenment, but because it shared the same title as Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, no one directly called the name of the place of enlightenment. They all referred to it simply as “place of enlightenment.”

Ling Han settled everyone down at a very far location. If he began fighting with Shatter Mountains, who knew how much terrifying damage would be caused.

He brought his disciples with him, as well as Little Qing, Small Rock, Rabbit, Old Ginseng, and the large black dog. This lineup could also be considered quite strange.

If it was just this few people, he would be able to send them all away before the battle with Shattering Mountains began, and there was no need to worry that there would be any problems.

“Ao, ao, ao, Grandpa Dog is going to do something big!” The large black dog stood on his hind legs like a human, his iron underwear reflecting cold light as he swayed back and forth.

“Grandpa Dog, please protect me!” Rabbit grabbed onto the large black dog’s thigh, and rubbed its head against the large black dog’s iron underwear.

“Shoo, shoo, shoo, or Grandpa Dog might want to eat a spicy rabbit’s head!” The large black dog swung its behind around.

“Grandpa Dog, do you want to piss? Why don’t you just piss on the ground?” The old ginseng wore a vulgar expression.

The large black dog almost jumped up in anger. ‘Why do you want me to pee? Could it be that you want to plant yourself in the ground to absorb nutrition?’

“Get lost! Grandpa Dog doesn’t want to pee!”

The old ginseng wore an astounded expression as he asked, “A dog can’t change its habit of peeing, right?”

“The saying is ‘a dog can’t change its habit of eating poop!” the golem corrected[1]. Dumbly, it even boasted to the large black dog, “Grandpa Dog, Big Rock is right, right!”
