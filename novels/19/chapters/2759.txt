2760 Not interfering

Everyone shook their head.

Just because Yu Wudi had a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate for a father backing him up, he had gathered accomplices to bully Ling Jianxue. How could he have imagined that the latter, too, had a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate for a father? See, the latter’s old man had come to get vengeance. Could this be blamed on Ling Han?

Who would have no temper when his son was being bullied right under his nose?

“You are not at the Second Tier!” the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate spoke up. His voice was filled with certainty.

!!

A Second Tier was definitely not like this, and he was very sure of that.

If he wasn’t a Second Tier, then which Tier was he?

Everyone was curious. Ling Han had just exchanged a single blow with the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate, and had not fallen into any disadvantage at all in terms of strength. At the very least, he should be a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, right?

Ling Han smiled. “No.”

The Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate was filled with confusion. The other party had clearly not extracted the fundamental power of the Genesis World, and was capable of matching him purely with his own strength. In fact, he was even slightly superior, so the other’s cultivation level definitely had to be Third Tier and above.

But the problem here was, why hadn’t he used his full power?

‘To get revenge for your son, you are already creating such a big commotion in the martial academy. What other reservations would you have?’

Could it be?

His eyes flickered, and a possibility rose up in his mind, causing his whole body to tremble.

“Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” he blurted out.

When these words fell, a wave of commotion arose among the crowd.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate? How could that be? What kind of massive joke was being played here?

Was there any Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate that was capable of matching a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?

‘Heh.’

The problem here was that this massive joke had been blurted out by the mouth of the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate, a genuine Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

How could he be mistaken? Was his insight inferior to theirs? Would he deliberately try to scare them with such alarming words?

Ling Han had no intention of hiding the fact. He nodded. “That’s right.”

“You are Ling Han, that Ling Han from an epoch ago?” the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate continued. He could recall now. An epoch ago, he had still been a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, and he had heard that a fierce guy had arrived at the first spatial plane, and had easily charged his way into the general leaderboard.

At the time, the Crimson Clouds had been thinking that when Ling Han advanced into Heavenly Venerable Tier, and entered into the second spatial plane, he would take a good look at this newly rising star.

But in the end… Ling Han had disappeared.

However, Wu Haoyang, who had shared fame with Ling Han, emerged as a new force and soared in status. By now, he was already a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, equal to Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian. Together, they were called the Three Kings, and were characters that even the Crimson Clouds could only look up at with admiration.

Originally, it had been thought that Ling Han could only serve as a background for Wu Haoyang, yet everyone had never imagined that he would have appeared once again after so many years had passed.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could match a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate; then when he reached Fourth Tier… hiss!

The Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate did not dare think further. Just how strong would this lord become in future?

“Ling Han, this is the martial academy, after all. How about you take a step back?” he persuaded.

Firstly, he had a favorable opinion of Ling Han’s future prospects, and secondly, Ling Han had also used strength to show that he possessed the ability to match a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate and become his equal. Naturally, the actual Heavenly Venerate was willing to stop putting on airs.

Yu Wudi and Cheng Feiwen were both extremely depressed. They were the victims here, and the man was actually persuading the culprit kindly right in front of them?

Ling Han shook his head. “Impossible. Today, I will definitely make the criminals pay the price!”

‘You are the real criminal here!’ Yu Wudi and Cheng Feiwen were both shouting mentally, yet they could only emit moans with their mouths due to the pain.

Ling Han continued to drag the two of them forwards, and the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate’s expression was ugly.

He should stop Ling Han, but he had just come for his shift to oversee the martial academy, and he was the only Heavenly Venerate in the whole martial academy. He knew himself—he was no match for Ling Han, so how could he manage to stop him?

If he stepped forwards to pester Ling Han, that would only be asking for his own humiliation. There might be ground-breaking news of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate being outmatched by a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

In his eyes, his reputation was far more important than the lives of Yu Wudi and company.

If they died, that would be it. In any case, the Crimson Clouds had already tried to stop Ling Han; it was just that he had not managed to succeed.

“Brother Ling, behave yourself!” the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate said solemnly, then turned, and left. He would report this matter to the higher-ups. As for how Ling Han would be dealt with in the future, that would have to depend on the will of those powerful figures.

He had left… Left!

Everyone’s mouth was wide open, unable to speak.

‘Aren’t you here to oversee the martial academy? Now, someone is committing a crime in public, and you are actually not interfering at all?’

“It is not that Lord Crimson Clouds does not wish to interfere, but rather… This man is too strong, so even Lord Crimson Clouds cannot subdue him!” Someone revealed the truth of the matter.

“Ling Han, Ling Han… Lord Crimson Clouds has said before that this is a character from an epoch ago.”

“Ah, I remember now, there was indeed a fierce guy an epoch ago! Have you guys seen the names of Zhang San and Li Si on the Eternal Stone? That had been left behind by Ling Han!”

“Also, it is said that when he was at the Realm Battlefield, he had only taken over a dozen thousand years to charge into the top 100 of the general leaderboard. He is definitely extremely freakish.”

“You guys know Wu Haoyang, right? In the past, Ling Han had fully suppressed Wu Haoyang, and claimed the honor of being the strongest of that era.”

Gasp!

Everyone inhaled sharply. It might be very abstract to speak of other matters, but Wu Haoyang’s great reputation was too prominent. He had only used 1.2 billion years to become a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, but it was too difficult to complete the step from Fourth Tier to Fifth Tier, and that was why he had been staying at Fourth Tier all this while.

He was the strongest prodigy in all of history, and together with Xin Qihu and Lin Youlian, the three were collectively known as the Three Great Heavenly Kings. In the future, it was possible that they could attain Seventh Tier, and were the hopes of the Genesis World.

And in the past, Ling Han… had been slightly superior to even Wu Haoyang, so it was naturally understandable how he could be so freakish. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han was expressionless. He walked in the martial academy, and found the people that had bullied his son one after another.

Some had not gotten the news yet, and he managed to capture them right in their abodes. Some of them had received the news and fled, but there was absolutely no way they could manage to flee from Ling Han. He captured them, and took them back to the martial academy.

There were already as many as 12 people that were tied up in the chains, and these were all the culprits that had ganged up on Ling Jianxue previously.

...

Aside from Yu Wudi, Ling Han hung the other 11 people up. Then, he stomped on Yu Wudi, his foot crushing the other’s face.

In the Celestial Realm, this man could still have been considered Ling Han’s match, but now he was no longer qualified at all.

“Ling Han, just because your cultivation level is higher than mine, you are bullying me. What is so impressive about that? When my father returns, he will definitely behead you!” Yu Wudi cried out loudly, his eyes spitting fire.

Ling Han nodded. “I have some debts to settle with Imperial Void as well. If he returns, I will kill him.”

“You…” Yu Wudi’s demeanor involuntarily weakened. Even the Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate was no match for Ling Han, and the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate had not advanced to the Second Tier very long ago, so there was even less chance that the latter could be a match for Ling Han.

“Let me ask you, do you regret?” Ling Han asked.

Yu Wudi did not dare to speak tough anymore. He definitely had to yield for the moment, so he nodded. “Yes.”

“Do you know the error of your ways?” Ling Han asked again.

“I was wrong.” Yu Wudi was very well-behaved.

“Good.” Ling Han nodded. He tapped out a finger. Pa! One of Yu Wudi’s arms instantly exploded, turning into a rain of blood.

“Ah…” Yu Wudi screamed out in pain, and almost passed out. Originally, he had thought that submitting would make Ling Han spare him, but clearly, he had thought wrong.

...

Yet Ling Han did not have the slightest sympathy. He tapped out another finger. Pa! Yu Wudi’s other arm exploded as well. Ling Han did not stop at all. After another tap of his finger, Yu Wudi’s legs exploded, one after the other.

There were people watching them, and none of them dared to make a noise.

This guy was too ruthless, wasn’t he? Just because Yu Wudi had beaten Ling Han’s son, Ling Han actually dared to execute punishment in full public in the martial academy like this. Was he planning to execute a thousand wounds on Yu Wudi while he was alive?

In the future, they definitely could not become enemies with Ling Jianxue…. no, they had best hide as far away as possible when they encountered anyone by the surname of Ling.
