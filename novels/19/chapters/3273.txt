Chapter 3274 - 3274: Super Shameless

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What was the meaning of Ling Han’s random words?

The eruption of the Blood Transformation Tier only lasted for ten minutes.

It turned out that Ling Han was only stalling for time when he spoke to him just now. His intention was to directly waste the explosive period of his blood and Qi boiling.

Fuck, how could you be so devious? How could you be so unscrupulous?

Shameless! Too shameless!

Hu Yang was so angry that he couldn’t speak at all. Ling Han was a prodigy, and a fellow student from the same academy. How dare he use such a dirty trick!

However, it was too early to celebrate. Even if he can’t boil his blood and erupt, how can Ling Han possibly be his match?

“Shameless scoundrel, do you think that I can’t deal with you just because I don’t have any explosive power?” he said balefully. He still possessed nearly

1.5million kilograms of strength, which was almost twice as much as Ling

Han’s.

This doubling of power was definitely not as simple as two people joining forces. Moreover, although Ling Han’s movement technique was admirable, he could also choose not to use his power. It wasn’t like he couldn’t afford to exhaust it.

“If you don’t apologize to Senior Sister Lian, I’ll beat you until you’re convinced!” Ling Han attacked, launching an attack at Hu Yang.

Only now did everyone understand the meaning of what Ling Han had just said, and all of them secretly thought how truly evil he was, actually thinking of such a method to exhaust one of Hu Yang’s trump cards.

However, thinking about it again, Ling Han was only in the Meridian Opening Tier, so it was already unfair for him to fight Hu Yang. Why should he have to foolishly face him head-on?

From the start, he was forced to use such underhanded means.

Besides, wasn’t Hu Yang the one who took the initiative to stop? Who could he blame?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han and Hu Yang engaged in a great battle. This time, Hu Yang did not unleash his full power. Although he still held an absolute advantage in terms of power, when faced with Ling Han’s floating movement technique, his overwhelming strength was actually unable to play a decisive role.

In other words, if Hu Yang did not use his ultimate move, at this rate, he would never be able to defeat Ling Han.

Of course, the reverse was the same. The initiative was still in Hu Yang’s hands.

Soon, it would not be like this anymore.

Ling Han thought to himself. He captured the frequency of Hu Yang’s attacks, then channeled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, and suddenly threw a punch.

This was the Demonic Monkey Fists, and when used by the current Ling Han, it was as if he had transformed into a Primitive Age Demonic Monkey, capable of splitting the heavens above and subduing the earth below. In addition to the overlapping of 20 layers of power, he possessed incomparably terrifying destructive power.

Moreover, this power overlap was adjusted according to the frequency of Hu Yang’s attacks.

Hu Yang met the attack with his own, but the power disintegrated layer by layer, as if it was useless.

BANG!

Ling Han’s fist smashed over, and Hu Yang’s entire body was sent flying.

Instantly, the entire venue fell silent.

In a head-on confrontation, a Meridian Opening Tier elite sent a Fifth Change elite battling with all his might flying—even if Hu Yang didn’t boil his blood and Qi, this was still an unbelievable miracle.

Hu Yang was sent flying. He landed heavily on the ground, but he immediately got up, his expression changing drastically.

He was actually sent flying by Ling Han. It wasn’t because he had underestimated his opponent. In contrast, it was while he was facing him head-on.

There was no doubt that this matter would spread throughout the academy by tomorrow at the latest, and he would become a complete laughing stock. In the future, he would also become a stepping stone in Ling Han’s first legend.

No, he couldn’t lose. He didn’t want to play such a role.

He spat out a mouthful of blood. That attack just now had indeed injured him, but he was a Fifth Change cultivator after all. This kind of attack wasn’t enough to severely injure him.

Hu Yang spread his arms, and his hands turned into claws. Black light flickered on his fingertips.

Ling Han tensed. The other party had used a martial arts technique.

Just take the Demonic Monkey Fists for example. It could stack up to 108 layers of power. How shocking was its power?

“To be able to force me to use the Destruction Claw, you can be proud of yourself,” Hu Yang said balefully.

Ling Han cracked his knuckles, producing a crisp sound. He was not afraid to fight.

“Myriad Annihilation!” Hu Yang leaped over, and pressed out with his claw, forming numerous afterimages that suppressed towards Ling Han. Ling Han used the Demonic Monkey Fists, and charged towards Hu Yang.

BANG!

The fist and palm collided, and a loud thunderous noise erupted. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s body shook, and he staggered back.

He raised his hand and saw a few bloody holes on his fist. Although it was not deep into his flesh, it had already touched his bones.

The power of Hu Yang’s claw was astonishing!

Ling Han shook his hand. Thankfully, his bones were hard. Otherwise, it was very likely that his bones would have fractured.

It was indeed very powerful.

“Hmph, you have no idea what price I paid to cultivate the Destruction Claw!” Hu Yang said proudly. “Ever since I was five years old, I’ve been inserting my fingers into a box filled with iron thorns every day. Do you know how painful that is?”

“Every time it’s over, I soak it in medicinal juice to quickly heal the wound.”

“Like this, day after day, year after year, I practiced for twenty-two years!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Not bad, your perseverance is quite impressive.”

From Ling Han’s point of view, it would take tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of millions of years for anyone to cultivate a cultivation technique in the Genesis World. In contrast, Hu Yang only used 22 years to attain this level of strength. Well, it was probably a long time for his standards.

It couldn’t be helped. This world’s martial arts had just begun to flourish, and the lifespan of a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator was only about 200 years.

Hu Yang was very displeased with Ling Han’s answer. He humphed, and said, “You don’t seem to think much of it, so I’ll let you experience the true power of the Destruction Claw!”

He charged over, his claws dancing as he launched a fierce attack at Ling Han.

Since he knew the power of the Destruction Claw, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t take it head-on. Instead, he activated Shuttle Steps, and his body floated as he continuously dodged.

He secretly sighed. His body refinement had not reached its peak. Otherwise, why would he be afraid of the Destruction Claw?

“Do you think that I can’t do anything to you just because you’ve pulled away from me?” Hu Yang said with a cold smile. Shua shua shua shua, he continuously struck out with his claws, then his Qi shot out, transforming into claws visible to the naked eye that covered the sky and earth as they rushed towards Ling Han.

This was the Destruction Claw. Even if it was just a burst of energy, it was still filled with destructive power.

Ling Han’s figure swayed, dodging the opponent’s attack. He struck out with the Demonic Monkey Fists, seizing the opponent’s opening to counterattack.

However, the two of them had already distanced themselves from each other. With their high speed, the chances of their attacks hitting each other were very low.

The two of them clashed like this. It looked like neither of them could do anything to the other, but everyone knew that this battle had become a protracted battle. Whoever could last longer would obtain victory in the battle.

Who would have thought?

A Meridian Opening Tier elite was actually able to force a Fifth Change elite to such a state.

Speaking of which, Hu Yang really felt very wronged. If he had channeled theALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Destruction Claw when his blood and Qi was boiling, then he believed that Ling Han would not have been able to dodge at all. That attack speed was simply too fast.

Thinking of this, everyone couldn’t help but remark how Ling Han was two-faced.

However, the mystical power reserves of the Meridian Opening Tier could not compare to that of a Fifth Change elite. The final result would definitely be Hu Yang’s victory..
