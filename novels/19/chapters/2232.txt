Chapter 2233: Failure

This white skeleton… It seemed like the Creator’s hand had slipped when He had been creating new beings. He had wanted to remold this thing that had been half-created, but after He kneaded it a few times, He changed His mind again, and decided to give it life.

Thus, it was ugly and strange, and words could not be used to describe just what exactly it looked like.

Ling Han swept an eye over it. The bones of this skeleton were very disorderly, clearly having been pieced together from the bones of a considerable number of different corpses.

“Be careful, Young Master Han,” Lu Zhen reminded him. “These skeletons are manifested from the corpses of elites from the Foreign Realm, and have a sliver of intent that has not been destroyed by the heaven and earth yet. Though those with higher cultivation levels have already been wiped out by the Celestial Kings, they are still relatively powerful.”

Ling Han nodded. Since Nie Heshan assigned them to train here, he was sure that this skeleton should reach the Immortal Palace Tier—or rather, there would be Immortal Palace Tier skeletons appearing.

This monster was not a living creature, and its cultivation level could not be distinguished. Only in battle would they find out the exact details of its battle prowess.

Ling Han strode forwards, approaching this skeleton.

“Hiss, hiss!” This skeleton released a strange sound, then suddenly waved its arm, and bones about three meters long slammed towards Ling Han.

Ling Han moved.?Peng, he exchanged a blow with this skeleton. That skeleton’s figure was immediately sent backwards from the impact, and Ling Han’s body trembled, feeling a sharp stabbing pain in his eyes, as if blood was about to drip from his eyes.

He couldn’t help but feel surprised. The battle prowess of this skeleton was actually not very strong, only slightly stronger than Fourth Secret, but when it struck, its attacks carried the violent air of this place, dealing a considerable blow to Ling Han’s divine sense.

No wonder Nie Heshan had told them to come train here. It would indeed be very effective for training purposes here.

Hu, the white skeleton boasted extreme toughness, and immediately brandished another arm to slam Ling Han.

Ling Han leaped, and struck consecutively, endlessly barraging the white skeleton.

Peng, peng, peng, under his endless wave of attacks, multiple cracks appeared on the bones on the skeleton, just like a spider’s web.

Kuang, with another heavy punch, the skeleton finally crumbled, its bones falling all over the ground.

Yet Ling Han immediately fell into a seated position. Though he had gained victory, the aura that the skeleton had carried in its attacks was endlessly blasting towards him. Some had already entered his body, and was presently causing havoc within. He had to expel it immediately, or it would become a huge problem.

It took him a day and a night to finally expel this murderous aura from within his body. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This was not the Regulation of Slaughter, but rather the defiance, anger, and other emotions left by cultivators of the Foreign Realm after their death. It could be fatal.

Ling Han wiped away the sweat on his forehead, yet discovered to his surprise that his cultivation level had actually increased slightly in just this one day and night.

At first, he was confused, but then realization dawned on him.

These elites of the Foreign Realm were indeed extremely strong, concealing great power in their bodies. Even after death, this power had not completely dispersed, and ground by the heaven and earth here, this power had become something that could be absorbed by the cultivators of this realm.

However, it was not just anyone who could easily absorb this power. It also carried the murderous aura of elites from the Foreign Realm within, and one had to be able to bear the barrage of this murderous aura to be able to absorb this power.

“As much as possible, kill these skeletons. It will be very beneficial,” Ling Han said.

Mei Hua and the others all nodded. Actually, they had long since known that killing the skeletons here would be very beneficial, but they had been following Shen Chao’s lead previously, so what chance would they have had to move? Any rare skeleton they encountered would be divided among the natives.

They continued onwards, and their luck wasn’t too bad. Less than half a day later, they encountered another skeleton, and this one was an Earth Soul Tier at that.

This kind of skeleton contained too little power within them, and Ling Han couldn’t be bothered, so he simply had Mei Hua and the others move instead.

They successfully destroyed this skeleton, and obtained the benefits within.

Ling Han laid out a formation around them, and then left by himself to search for new skeletal monsters.

In this one month, he had destroyed 14 skeletons in total, but there were only eight among them that were at the Immortal Palace Tier, while the other six were Dividing Soul Tiers. At first, Ling Han had not wanted to kill them, but these skeletons kept bothering him, so he could only move to kill all of them.

It was better than nothing, and he might as well take them.

His cultivation level had also increased visibly, reaching the middle stage of the First Secret. This kind of progress rate in the Immortal Palace Tier could be considered astonishingly rapid.

He returned to meet up with the rest. When all members of the 17th camp had arrived, whether it was Hu Niu, the Rain Emperor, the Empress, or the others, they had all improved clearly. Unfortunately, there were limited numbers of skeletons here, and they needed a very long time before they would be nurtured back into existence again, while there were too many people from Clear Heaven Pass, so they needed to take their turns in batches.

It was said that only a few limited people had the privilege to endlessly train in this place.

For example, Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, Hong Huang, and Jia Lan, the four supreme monarch tiers from the Saintly Origin Academy, as well as the two Monarch Stars from the borders, Aili Na and Xing Chenyue.

Logically, Ling Han and the Rain Emperor should also be able to get such treatment, but the Eternity Celestial King who had previously said that he would take care of them seemed to have forgotten them completely, and they could only cultivate just like the others, which restricted the progress rate of their cultivation level.

Would a Celestial King be forgetful?

Probably not. In that case, the fact that the Eternity Celestial King had not raised the positions of the two of them should have some other meaning.

“The poison has finally been completed!” Ling Han smiled slightly.

He, the Empress, and the others entered once more into the neutral zone, and began to release the poison from that cave mouth. However, on the outside, these seven poison pills were all shining brilliantly, filled with a refreshing fragrance, appearing completely like Celestial pills.

To disguise the effects of the poison pills, Ling Han had really gone to much effort.

“We must succeed. I spent countless of my Star Stones on this.” Ling Han felt a slight heartache.

Even if it was poison pills, they were still Four-Star pills, so their cost was naturally extremely high.

Ling Han threw the poison pills in, and as a sucking force surged out,?hu, the seven poison pills were immediately sucked into the cave, instantly disappearing without a trace.

The five of them then sat beside this cave, waiting for the poison to take effect.

However, the ground suddenly trembled after a while, as if an earthquake was happening.

Yet the five of them did not panic, but were instead overjoyed. This meant that the poison pills had taken effect, and that was why that powerful existence would be rampaging around. It was close to death. However, after another while, the tremors stopped, and a frightening aura surged out of the cave mouth, filled with vitality and shockingly strong.

“Oh no, not only did the monster not die, it has instead become even stronger!”

“Could it be a venomous beast that does not fear poison, but would instead turn poison into its own power, and increase its cultivation level!”

Ling Han and the others were all astounded. This was greatly beyond their expectations.

They had gone out for wool, but come back shorn!

“No!” Ling Han immediately shook his head. “Poison is called poison because of Regulations. When one gets to the bottom of the matter, there is not much difference between the Regulations of Poison and Slaughter, Time and Space.”

The Empress deduced many things from this, and immediately understood Ling Han’s thought process, and said, “But in this neutral zone, Regulations have been broken, and the Regulation of Poison could possibly become Regulation of Wood, which is instead filled with powerful vitality and life.”

“So when we used our poison pill to kill this monster with poison, not only did it have no effect, it instead caused it to become even stronger!”

Hu Niu clapped her hands once, and declared, “Then, we will use a tonic to poison it to death!”
