Chapter 3572: Hong Tianbu’s betrayal

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Imperial Princes had all been punished by the Holy Emperor, and they would not be able to leave their residences for the next three years. This naturally caused a heated discussion in the Imperial Capital.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel rueful. Ling Han was really lucky, always managing to avert danger.

Yi, he couldn’t be Chen Fengyan’s illegitimate son, right? Otherwise, why would he dote on him so much?

This was the latest news, and very soon, another explosive piece of news spread out.

Hong Tianbu entered the Nine Spirit Sect, becoming the disciple of the Nine Spirit True Lord.

When the news spread out, the Imperial Capital was shaken.

Although the Primordial True Lord and others founding sects and recruiting disciples was extremely normal, Hong Tianbu’s identity was too sensitive.

He was one of the twin prodigies of the Imperial Capital, and incredibly high hopes had once been placed on him, and that was the case even now.

However, he had become a disciple of the Nine Spirits True Lord.

This was betrayal!

However, at this moment, Hong Tianbu was far away in the Nine Spirit Sect, so who would be able to charge over and execute him?

Furthermore, Hong Tianbu was a prodigy among prodigies, and should be able to become an elite of Celestial Path very soon. Then, unless the Holy Emperor moved personally, not only would anyone that went not be able to succeed, he would instead lose his life.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes turned towards the Foreign Affairs Department and Ling Han.

Firstly, the matters of sects were under the authority of the Foreign Affairs Department. As the Chief of the Department, Ling Han naturally had the responsibility and duty to hunt down this kind of traitor.

Secondly, Ling Han and Holy Emperor were collectively known as the Twin Prodigies of the Imperial City. If there was anyone below the level of Holy Emperor that could match Hong Tianbu, then who else could it be but Ling Han?                              5

Thus, there was this kind of public opinion in the Imperial Capital, strongly requesting Ling Han to move out, and capture Hong Tianbu for trial.

With the encouragement of those with ulterior motives, this kind of cheers was earth-shattering.

If this kind of traitor was not eliminated, would the Foreign Affairs Department still have the face to exist?

“Ling Han, there must be a mastermind behind all this,” Princess Bixiao said resolutely.

Ling Han nodded. It was most likely those Imperial Princes. They couldn’t leave their homes, but how could it be that they didn’t have subordinates to use?

“Don’t worry about that. No matter what others say, the initiative is still in my hands,” he said very calmly.

Princess Bixiao breathed a sigh of relief. She was really afraid that Ling Han would run over to where the Nine Spirits True Lord was in a moment of impulse. Though he was very extraordinary, faced with a Spirit Transformation True Lord, it was really unknown how he would die.

“However, there will be a battle between Hong Tianbu and I sooner or later. I still have to go to this Nine Spirit Sect,” Ling Han continued.

Princess Bixiao was instantly rendered speechless. Even if Ling Han could stand against Hong Tianbu, how far was the gap between him and a Spirit Transformation True Lord?

Going to the Nine Spirit Sect would only be courting death.

“No rush, no rush. For the moment, I will not go to the Nine Spirit Sect,” Ling Han guaranteed.

However, after only two days, a change took place.

The Primordial Sect suddenly released news that a martial arts tournament would be held, inviting all the young prodigies of the world to participate. If one won first place, they would be rewarded with a Star Origin Fruit, and even if they didn’t win first place, as long as they performed well, they would have a chance of being taken in as a personal disciple by the Primordial True Lord.

What was a Star Origin Fruit?

This was a Two Star Celestial medicine, and its effects were to cleanse one’s body and improve the essence of one’s life!

If it was given to those below Celestial Path, under the condition that their cultivation level remained unchanged, the shackles in their bodies would be unlocked, which was equivalent to increasing their ability to battle against those of the same cultivation level. This was a fundamental change. And if it was given to those above Celestial Path, they would also be able to push aside the shackles that they had not been able to unlock previously, and improve their foundations by a certain amount.

However, the upper limit of the Star Origin Fruit was the Cauldron Forging Tier. If a Core Formation cultivator took it, it would have no effect at all Otherwise, this would not be TWo Star Celestial medicine, but rather Three Star or Four Star Celestial medicine.

Even so, those who had gotten the news were all incredibly excited.

Celestial medicine! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

To say nothing else, just these two words alone were enough to make one’s heart beat wildly, and make one unable to control himself.

Furthermore, this effect was practical. It would increase one’s essence, unlike increasing cultivation level, which could be achieved with some time anyways. Ling Han was naturally tempted as well, and immediately decided to take a trip.

“Don’t be rash. Just look at the rules. Participation is limited to those below Celestial Path.” Princess Bixiao advised. This guy was really worrisome. She had just advised him not to go to the Nine Spirit Sect, and now, in the blink of an eye, he was going to the Primordial Sect.

This was the territory of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, so you’re a bit too bold, aren’t you?

“Now, how many people don’t know that you are practically invincible against those below Celestial Path, yet they still chose to host such a martial arts competition? Could it be that they are deliberately gifting you a treasure?” Ling Han nodded. He had killed a disciple of the Primordial True Lord. It was not impossible that the Primordial True Lord would deliberately target him. However, in his opinion, the Primordial True Lord indeed wanted to use this opportunity to find some outstanding saplings to take as disciples.

Thus, this was killing two birds with one stone. Even if Ling Han had not taken the bait, the Primordial Sect would not have wasted a Star Origin Fruit for nothing.

Ling Han had no reason to miss out on this kind of treasure. Furthermore, he also had a stubborn streak. The more others wanted to harm him, the more he wanted to trample all over this trap.

Of course, he definitely couldn’t just run over like this. Openly walking over would be equivalent to walking right into a trap.

He could change his identity, and when he obtained the Star Origin Fruit and returned, he could then reveal his identity. That would be equivalent to giving the Primordial True Lord a resounding slap in the face.

Just thinking about it made him feel slightly excited.

However, how was he supposed to change his identity?

Ordinary disguise techniques definitely wouldn’t work, but what if he changed the density and distribution of his muscles?

Ling Han returned to his bedroom on his own, and began to experiment in front of the mirror.

He moved his muscles slightly, and his appearance instantly changed. “However, these eyes of mine will still exposeme.” Ling Han frowned. Eyes were the window to one’s soul, especially when his Spiritual Power was strong His eyes were extraordinarily bright, possessing an indescribable grace. He forcibly bound his Spiritual Power, and the effects were immediately apparent. His eyes became dim. Though they were still filled with sharpness, they were completely different from how they had been previously.

“It should be possible,” Ling Han murmured. “However, I have to control my muscles at all times. I have to be careful with every word and smile, and I can’t give myself away.”

“En, from now on, my name is… Can Ye.”

He was completely incompetent when it came to names, so he couldn’t be bothered to think of a new name, and directly used the name of an acquaintance.

Continuously training in front of the mirror, he had to remember his own appearance. Otherwise, the slightest change would reveal a flaw. Additionally, when he was talking and smiling, his expression would change. What kind of appearance should he show?

He trained endlessly, and spent a whole day’s time. Finally, he could do it. With a single thought, he would immediately change into the appearance that he wanted, and every time, it would be exactly the same.

Additionally, it was the voice. This was easy, as long as the frequency was changed, the voice would naturally change.

And that was that.

Ling Han went to look for Princess Bixiao, and when he knocked on the door, he also changed his appearance.

Princess Bixiao opened the door, yet saw a complete stranger standing at the door. She couldn’t help but look surprised, “Who are you?”

“Tsk, you don’t even recognize me anymore?” Ling Han asked in his original voice.

Ling Han!” Princess Bixiao exclaimed in astonishment..
