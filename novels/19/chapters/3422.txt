Chapter 3423: Palace of Sacrifice

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Neither side was engaging in gang fights. Instead, they were fighting one-on-one, taking turns, as if they wanted to use this kind of method to decide the ownership of this palace, or decide the ratio of treasures.

Ling Han looked around, and discovered a few powerful beings.

Four Enlightenment Tier elites!

The Jin Clan had two, and the Lu Clan had two. However, the two from the Lu Clan were both old, while the Jin Clan had one old and one young.

Ling Han nodded. This was more like how the hidden clans should be. Otherwise, if they didn’t even have some young elites, how could they have the nerve to call themselves the heirs of the civilization of the last era?

After watching their battle, though Ling Han admitted that his battle prowess was inferior to these four people, they couldn’t be considered prodigies at all.

It was just that their cultivation level was extremely high. If it was a battle of equal cultivation levels, they would only be mediocre.

This should be because the hidden clan had grasped a large amount of cultivation resources, which allowed their cultivation level to advance by leaps and bounds.

Ling Han thought for a moment in his mind. If he used Absolute Fairness, would he be able to defeat these four people in ten minutes?

The answer was affirmative, but the problem was, these four people had to choose not to flee, and fight him to the death inside the formation.

However, this was too difficult. When their cultivation level was suppressed, how could these four people not run?

There was only a diameter of 30 meters, and Ling Han wanted to defeat four people at the same time. This was a little difficult.

Once they exited the formation, they would be able to waste time, and drag things out until the formation was exhausted. At present, Ling Han was still unable to defeat an existence of Enlightenment Tier.

Thus, if he made a move, he would definitely have to defeat all four of them with thunderous force.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. He would first charge forward and destroy one of them, then quickly chase after the second person. This should be possible. Then, he would use the Heavenly Pattern Jade to destroy one… and then the seven babies could kill another.

His eyes lit up. Why was he only thinking about himself?

Which of the babies didn’t have the ability to battle above their cultivation level? As long as their cultivation level was the same, they were all fierce.

En, four opponents was completely no problem. Even if it was eight, they could fight one-on-one, er, provided Seventh Baby didn’t suddenly fall asleep.

With this in mind, Ling Han was now completely confident.

He turned his gaze to that palace. Unlike the others, it stood erect at the highest point of the cliff, as if it was about to reach the skies. The palace doors were also different from the others. They were tightly closed, and there were two Bi’an standing guard at the doors, exuding a vicious might, as if they were living creatures?.

“Sixth Baby, see if you can enter,” he said.

“Alright, Father.” Sixth Baby moved out, and then there was no more movement.

No one could capture her course. Perhaps she was still in the same place, or perhaps she had already entered into the palace.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel lucky. Thankfully, Sixth Baby didn’t have the same problem as Seventh Baby. Otherwise, if she would fall asleep on a whim as well, no one would have been able to discover her. She would definitely be lost.

After a while, Sixth Baby returned.

It was actually like this — pa, a bright red fruit appeared out of thin air and fell onto the ground. Then, Sixth Baby said, “Father, there’s a sacrificial altar inside, and there are a lot of tributes placed on it. However, there are layers of formations protecting it, so I can only reach what is at the bottom.”

The invisibility of Sixth Baby had a unique trait. If she wrapped around something completely, it would also possess the characteristic of invisibility. Not only could it not be seen, it could also pass through walls.

How was it going to be wrapped?

The smaller items were grabbed by hand, and the larger ones were stuffed into her mouth.

Ling Han looked at the fruit. It was the size of a walnut, and with Sixth Baby’s small hand, there was absolutely no way she could grab it. Looking at the drool on it, he was absolutely sure that this had been carried out by Sixth Baby’s mouth.

It was fine. He just had to wash it.

“This is an Earth Spirit Fruit.” Second Baby glanced at it, “It can improve one’s physique. Theoretically, as long as there are enough Earth Spirit Fruits, it can improve the physique of an ordinary person to the level of Pseudo Divine Physique.”

Ling Han knew what a Divine Physique was. Not only was the speed of cultivation astonishingly fast, but by nature, they had grasp of a Mystical Power. However, Divine Physiques were generally born, and although they could also be created postnatally, they were far inferior to the an Innate Divine Physique.

And this fruit could allow one to reach the level of Pseudo Divine Physique?

This was indeed extraordinary.

“Father, we’re all born with Divine Physique, so this Earth Spirit Fruit can only be eaten by you.” Eldest Baby picked up the fruit and sent the pervert pig flying with a kick. This guy ahad ctually crawled over silently, wanting to secretly eat the fruit.

However, didn’t it think that with its fat figure, it would have to rest for three steps for every single step it took? Its purpose was naturally seen through with a single glance.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before placing the Earth Spirit Fruit into the gourd. He could eat this later, so there was no hurry.

On the other side, the battle between the Jin Clan and the Lu Clan had also ended. They seemed to have reached some kind of agreement, and joined forces to walk towards the great doors of the palace.

Ling Han was just about to make a move, when he was stopped by Sixth Baby.

“Father, watch first, hehe.”

Sixth Baby was still quite dependable, so Ling Han did not move as he was told. Instead, he watched on patiently. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The members of the Jin Clan and Lu Clan arrived at the entrance of the palace hall, and began to study how to open the great doors, but after a few attempts, a strange light flickered. The two stone Bi’an that were standing guard at the doors actually “came back to life”.

Xiu, xiu. The two stone Bi’an immediately pounced towards the crowd, instantly causing great chaos.

“What’s going on?”

“Why did stone statues suddenly move?”

“Ah, so powerful.”

Caught off guard, several people were instantly injured and sent flying.

Fortunately, the four Enlightenment Tier elites from the two clans all moved at the same time, suppressing the two stone Bi’an.

The stone Bi’an’s cultivation level was only in the Enlightenment Tier, so the situation immediately calmed down.

The advantage of the human side was that they had two more Enlightenment Tier elites, and the stone Bi’an’s advantage was that they were not living beings, but rather made of stone. They had no vital points at all, and were unafraid of attack.

The battle between the two sides was incredibly intense.

Ling Han saw it clearly. At first, the four Enlightenment Tier elites kept their techniques to themselves, but after being forced into desperate straits, they had no choice but to use their ultimate moves. The three old men had only boiled their blood and Qi, but the young man directly drew out a Talisman Weapon, which turned into a war elephant, battling fiercely with the stone Bi’an.

That was a Mystery Realm Tier-level Talisman Weapon, right? The moment it was unleashed, it had the absolute upper hand, and very soon, suppressed a stone Bi’an.

The three old men worked together, and after some effort, they finally suppressed the other stone Bi’an as well.

Ling Han saw very clearly that this stone Bi’an was powered by a formation, but the might of this formation was definitely not comparable to how it had once been. Thus, the stone Bi’an’s battle prowess was only limited to Enlightenment Tier.

Otherwise, with there being a Heavenly Pattern Jade and a Two Star Spirit Tool, how could it be that the formation used to guard the sacrificial palace could only unleash the cultivation of Enlightenment Tier?

In the civilization of the last era, those below the Celestial Path could not be considered elites at all. How could it be that the formation laid out here was only used to guard against a few mere thieves?

“Father, let’s do it.” Eldest Baby was in high spirits, and her violent nature was already flaring up.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “All right!”

He leaped out, and the seven children followed behind him, majestically walking forwards.

However, in the eyes of others, this lineup was indescribably comical.
