1395 The Eleven Tigers of the Wang Clan

The Wang Clan were not residents of this town, but rather came from a large city.

The ancestor of the Wang Clan, Wang Hao, was merely over 2,000,000 years old at present, and he had already reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. In the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, this was already considered a first-grade force—Heavenly Body Tier naturally was the top-grade force.

Ordinarily, the higher the power, the fewer the children. This was because his essence had condensed, and added with the fact that cultivation itself was something that went against natural law, and he would receive a backlash from the heaven and earth, it was very difficult to leave behind descendants.

Many people would find it difficult to leave behind a child even after 10,000,000 years, and this was not the slightest bit strange. But this ancestor of the Wang Clan did not have any concern about this aspect. He had a total of 11 sons, and each of his sons was especially fertile as well.

These 11 sons were also extraordinarily talented in cultivation. Nine of them had advanced into the Sun Moon Tier, and the youngest two sons were only slightly inferior to their elder brothers. They were named the Eleven Tigers of the Wang Clan.

This time, all Eleven Tigers of the Wang Clan had mobilized and raced over here to compete for the treasure. However, because the treasure had not yet appeared, only five of the Tigers had taken part in the stakeout, while the remaining members of their group stayed in the town to preserve their strength.

The Eleven Tigers moved out, and brought with them a great many juniors so that they could come and gain some insight. The person who had harassed Jiang Qiaoling, and had had his balls destroyed for the attempt, was a direct grandson of Wang Chuanxi.

His grandson had been castrated, so how could Wang Chuanxi bear with that? He had immediately charged over.

He was not a rash person, but Ling Han’s aura was not apparent. It was as if he was an ordinary person. However, he could tell the cultivation levels of those beside him with a single look—they were merely in the Mountain River Tier. Then, since he was mixed in with these people, he obviously had to be in the Mountain River Tier as well.

****, a small character of Mountain River Tier also dared to trifle with their Wang Clan?

Ling Han cast an eye over him, and then withdrew his gaze. Wang Chuanxi was only in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, and was not even qualified to interest him regarding making a move. He waved him off dismissively, and said, “Discipline your own juniors well, or he won’t get off as easily next time.”

Wang Chuanxi involuntarily flew into a rage. ‘You are too arrogant, aren’t you!’ He swept a sinister look over Ling Han’s group, and said, “Humph, since you are all so stubborn, then I will kill all of you. This woman... shall become my grandson’s maid!”

He pointed at Jiang Qiaoling. All of this had been because of this b****!

She really did not know what was good for her. To gain the interest of his grandson was her good fortune, and she actually dared to refuse him, and even wound him!

He was without scruples, and immediately charged over. In his eyes, this was merely a group of Mountain River Tier weaklings. He would be able to kill them with a single move.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “If I made a move on you, others would say that I am being a bully.” But when it was time to move, he would not hesitate in the slightest, either. He pointed a finger, and pu, Wang Chuanxi immediately exploded, turning into a shower of blood.

He waved his hand again, and the shower of blood had burnt to nothing, becoming energy that returned to the heaven and earth. It was as if this person had never existed in the first place.

“You’re so strong, Founder!” Jiang Qiaoling quickly sucked up to Ling Han.

“That is thanks to Grandpa Ginseng’s teachings.” The old ginseng jumped onto Ling Han’s shoulder and boasted shamelessly.

“It’s been a long time since I have had some ginseng soup,” Ling Han stated deliberately.

The old ginseng clearly knew that Ling Han was joking, but was still so petrified that all the beards on his body stood on end. He quickly ran to stand on Jiang Qiaoling’s shoulder, not daring to stay beside a demon king like Ling Han.

He, and that little girl in the Celestial Realm, were all super gluttons. There was really nothing that they did not dare to eat.

The Seventh Tiger of the Wang Clan had been killed. This was big news, and immediately caused a great commotion in the town. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Master, we got the treasure!” After a while, Chen Ruijing and the others returned. He held a completely black wooden sword. It looked like a stick that was used to stir the coal. There were a great many nicks in it, and he could not tell how this was a treasure in the slightest.

“You all just managed to snatch this thing?” Ling Han couldn’t help a muscle twitching in his cheek.

“Master, even though this item looks very common, none of us managed to snap it in half,” Jiuyao said.

Ling Han was surprised. He snatched out at midair, and the wooden sword flew into his grasp. He casually waved it, and pa, a table was instantly shattered into pieces by the impact.

However, Ling Han frowned.

It had not been severed by the wooden sword, but rather had been because he had focused his power and directly shattered the table into collapsing. It could only be said that this wooden sword was indeed very sturdy. At the very least, it could bear Ling Han’s strength.

Ling Han tried to break this wooden sword, but this time, he was really stunned. With his strength, he actually could do absolutely nothing to it.

Merely for this reason, it could be called a treasure. At least it was sturdy enough.

“Let go of the treasured sword!”

“Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother!” At this time, two groups of people arrived at the teahouse at the same time.

“Yi, Old Six, Old Eight, Old Nine, why have you all come here? Did you get the news?”

“Damn it, Old Seven has been killed!”

“What?!”

Coincidentally, these two groups of people were all from the Wang Clan, just that one of the two groups was participating in the competition for the treasure and had just now raced here, whereas the other group were people that the Wang Clan had left behind to take care of things. After they found out that Old Seven[1] had been killed, all of them had raced over to avenge him.

Only Ling Han’s group was present in the teahouse, so it was too easy to identify them.

“Hand over the treasured sword, kneel down, and accept your death, and we can allow you a quick death!” the First Tiger of the Wang Clan declared balefully. They had been tyrannical for over 1,000,000 years, and this was the first time one of their brothers had been killed. This caused him to fly into a thunderous rage.

He was already in the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, and was only slightly inferior to his old father. He had enough confidence to be overbearing.

“Who do you think you are? You dare to speak this way to my master!?” Chen Ruijing was the first to step out.

The Tigers of the Wang Clan couldn’t help but be surprised. That was because Ling Han’s aura was reserved, and he looked very ordinary, so how could it be that he had a disciple in the Sun Moon Tier? But so what? Whoever touched a member of the Wang Clan, death was his only destiny!

At this time, even more people ran over. They were those who had taken part in the competition for the treasure and had failed. When they found out that Chen Ruijing and the others had brought the treasure here, they naturally chased them all the way here.

“Hand over the treasure!” At least a few hundred people shouted. Furthermore, there were more and more people making their way here.

They had got hold of the treasure and still did not rush to hide. They actually sat down boldly to sip tea here; something must have gone wrong with their heads.

“If you want the treasure, just come and get it. I will play with you all,” Jiang Yuefeng declared very showily, and even unfolded his paper fan. He was truly very dashing. No wonder he had managed to charm a large number those many years ago.

“Kill them!” Everyone did not hesitate. Though the majority of them did not even know what the treasure was, the word ‘treasure’ was enough motivation for them to put their lives on the line.

Chen Ruijing and the other disciples all charged out. If there was trouble, it was natural that it would be them disciples to do the work for their master.

Ling Han did not make a move. With his present abilities, he could subdue these people in a single instant. This was a good chance for his disciples to gain some experience.

“Stop!” A deep voice rang out, bringing with it a supreme air of assertiveness.

It was like a bolt of lightning flashing across a clear sky. Immediately, everyone was intimidated and stopped. Even Chen Ruijing and the others looked be struggling. They wanted to resist this kind of command, but their actions could not be controlled.

This was a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Otherwise, he would definitely not possess such intimidation.

A figure appeared, his eyes focused on the wooden sword in Ling Han’s hand. He asked, “Sir, could you part with the treasure?”

When these words were said, everyone, including the Ten Tigers of the Wang Clan, were stunned into open-mouthed shock.

This was a supreme elite of Heavenly Body Tier, and he was actually so polite?

[1] To clarify: the seventh brother in terms of seniority.
