Chapter 1965: Power of belief

Another month later, Ling Han finally stopped.

It was not because they had reached the summit, but rather that the slope had become level and flat here. He did not need to advance by gripping the steep angles of the mountain rocks any longer.

The three women also reluctantly released their hold. Clinging onto Ling Han was something that they could get addicted to. It was easy for them to lose themselves in his masculine smell.

Especially in the case of Bewitching Maiden Rou. This was her first time being in such intimate contact with Ling Han. Her face had directly flushed red, and her alluring eyes were as soft as water, indescribably cloying and sweet.

Ling Han sighed in relief, and said, “You guys are really quite heavy. In the future, you guys would really have to lose weight.”

While he had advanced very fast, it did not mean that the weight he had to sustain had become any less. It was only that his willpower was strong, and he had forcibly suppressed his weariness.

What woman liked to hear someone say that she was heavy, especially when the speaker was their lover? Hence, Ling Han was ganged up on by the three women, and after a bout of soft punches and kicks, the four of them finally continued on their way.

There was no mountain path here. The craggy mountain rose and fell in succession, every mountain rock was strangely shaped and bizarre.

Amidst a ringing cry, a Celestial Crane appeared, its wings flapping in the air. There was actually a person born on its back. His brows and beard were completely white, and he looked quite sage-like. The speed of the Celestial Crane was very fast, and in a few flaps, it had already disappeared at the summit.

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks, and could see shock in each other’s eyes. What was going on here? A Celestial Crane had actually appeared in this natural Mystery Realm?

“Huh?!”

The four of them exclaimed in shock at the same time because the craggy mountain rock around them had actually disappeared, and a wide, long path of white jade had appeared in front of them, winding all the way to the mountain summit.

Even while standing here, it was as if they could see a majestic palace at the summit. Its walls were bronze, and exuded an indescribably imposing air, seemingly capable of suppressing the heaven and earth and time.

In fact, they could even see that there were a great many people on the mountain path, worshiping on the whole way, as if they were the most faithful of believers. They would kowtow three times with every step, and were advancing to the summit at an extremely slow pace.

With every bow, the bronze palace seemed to brighten a slightest bit more. Though this kind of chance was very negligible, Ling Han and his group, being either monarch tiers or emperor tiers, could still feel this kind of change.

“This is power of belief,” Hu Niu said. “Belief is also a type of energy, and is a power that is unique to the world, and would not be controlled by great dao. Even though a single believer’s strength is weak, gathering the power of belief of thousands, of millions of believers would also effect a qualitative change.”

Ling Han nodded. “Something like power of the nation?”

“Not really, because power of the nation would require establishing a nation first, and using the totem as a medium to gather the power of the citizens.” Hu Niu shook her head. As the heir of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force, who also had the brand that had been left behind by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, her knowledge base was very broad and wide.

“The height of belief far surpasses power of the nation, and power of the nation would mean a feeling of belonging to this nation, while belief is about the individual, which is completely different.

“However, the power of belief, too, has its weaknesses. Why would believers want to believe in you?” Hu Niu paused. “That is because believers would encounter dilemmas, and at that time, they would ask the target of their belief for help. If they do not get any response, the believers may lose faith.

“It may be very, very hard for a believer to encounter a dilemma in 100 years, but once the numbers are increased, that would be great trouble.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Going by the looks of things, this was definitely the place of enlightenment for a Celestial King before, but a great battle happened one day, and everything was destroyed, turning into the model of the Three Blooms Valley.”

“Afterwards, the power of heaven and earth began to transform this place, and thus the present Three Blooms Valley came to be,” the Empress continued.

“Hence, everything is only an illusion. It is the image of prosperity that was left behind from countless years ago, when the place of enlightenment of the Celestial King still existed,” Bewitching Maiden Rou also said.

As she spoke, the majestic mountain path and those faithful believers also disappeared all of a sudden.

After all, this was only a fragment of the long passage of history, and had long since died, only available for later generations to reminisce.

Ling Han and his group sighed slightly. At the time, that Celestial King was at least Seventh heaven, and he should have been immortal for eternity, but now he had completely vanished in the long passage of history, and even his name was known to no one.

Even Celestial Kings were like this, then what true immortality was there? How could one truly cast away the bonds of life and death, and exist for eternity?

“Yi!” Hu Niu began to wrinkle her tiny nose again. “So fragrant!”

“Another Celestial medicine?” Ling Han asked. He naturally was incredibly confident in the little girl’s sense of smell.

Hu Niu leaned her head to one side, and after some thought, she said, “It should be Celestial medicine, but it is a little strange.”

“What’s strange about it?” Ling Han asked.

“I don’t know how to say it. Anyways, it is just very strange.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “Whatever the case, let’s search for it first.”

It was still Hu Niu leading the way. Not too long after, both Ling Han and the Empress also smelled the fragrance that was unique to Celestial medicine. A single sniff was enough for them to know. Their spirit instantly resonated with the great dao, and was not something that could be replaced by any other substance.

They went off in search of the fragrance, and very soon, they found a mountain cave that was incredibly dark.

The fragrance of the Celestial medicine originated from within the mountain cave.

“Smell of blood.” Hu Niu wrinkled her little nose again, showing a ferocious expression. She was especially sensitive when it came to things like killing intent.

Was it because those that had previously reached this place had conflicted over the Celestial medicine, which had led to a major battle?

“Everyone, be careful.” Ling Han strode forwards, heading to the cave entrance. Now that they were already here, there was naturally no logic in giving up halfway. He naturally would have to take a look.

The Empress and the others also followed, but they circled around once inside, yet discovered nothing.

The herbal fragrance was there, but there was no sign of the Celestial medicine.

“Perhaps it has already been taken.”

“Let’s go.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The four of them shook their heads, exited the mountain cave, and continued their way towards the summit.

When Ling Han and his group had completely vanished, a person walked out of the mountain cave. It was Ji Wuming.

His eyes flickered, and he murmured, “All four of them are Divine Fetuses. If I can swallow them, my Divine Fetus would definitely be able to improve further. Too bad, those three are not easily trifled with, especially that little girl. She should be the reincarnation of an old friend.

“Forget it, let’s catch enough fish here first, and then think of a way to swallow the Divine Fetuses of those four people.

“En... someone else is coming!”

A menacing expression appeared on his face as he slowly retreated into the mountain cave. The refreshing fragrance of Celestial medicine drifted out vaguely.

A male figure streaked past, and then suddenly stopped. His eyes were fixed on the mountain cave, showing an overjoyed expression.

This was a monarch tier of the Wide Prosperity Heaven, ranked 13th, and he had astonishing strength.

Inside the cave, vision would be affected, and the space was also limited. If someone lay in ambush to launch a sneak attack, that would be an extremely terrible thing that could happen. But he smiled proudly, and strode forwards boldly.

As a powerful monarch tier, what was there for him to fear?

Peng!

He had not entered for too long when the sounds of intense battle were heard from within the cave. The mountain rock here was frighteningly tough, and even a battle between Severing Mundane Tiers couldn’t cause any damage. There were only terrifying storms of energy continuously barraging out of the cave’s entrance.

However, it had only taken a while, and the cave returned to a state of peace. Ji Wuming walked out, a sliver of blood at the corners of his lips. However, with a lick of his tongue, it was wiped off cleanly.

He showed a smile of satisfaction. “I am only missing nine top-tier Divine Fetuses, and my Heaven Seizing Fortune Technique will reach Great Accomplishment.”
