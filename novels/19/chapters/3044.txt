3045 Confidence

Right now, the dimensions within Ling Han’s body were filled with vitality as more and more life forms emerged, despite them being only the most ordinary beasts and birds. Not to mention entering the era of cultivation, even intelligent life forms had yet to appear.

Ling Han was unable to guide the process. Although they were his, the dimensions were self-contained. He could only choose to use the Power of Dimension to nurture the growth of the dimensions.

He estimated that the dimensional growth rate was at least 100 times faster than his own cultivation speed.

This was extremely terrifying.

Originally, he had wanted all the dimensions to advance to high-tier high-level dimensions, which would require hundreds of epochs. However, a few epochs would be enough now.

Of course, the duration of a few epochs was also incomparably excessive to Ling Han.

If things were to continue developing according to the current situation, the entire Genesis World would definitely be devoured by Hysteria in less than an epoch.

However, Ling Han was beginning to have doubts.

Previously, he agreed with the World’s Will’s perspective that no matter how much he cultivated, he would never be able to catch up to Hysteria.

This was because Hysteria had never stopped cultivating. It had already devoured four transcendent dimensions. What did this mean? Just these four dimensions would provide Hysteria with powers of 40 Seventh Tiers at peak stage. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Coupled with the fact that Hysteria itself had transformed into a dimension, and it had naturally reached transcendent level a long time ago after so many years had passed, it would have the powers of 50 peak-stage Seventh Tiers at the very least.

You were improving, but Hysteria was also improving, so how could you be able to surpass it?

However, as Ling Han grasped more and more secret codes of life, he became more and more convinced that he had an extremely high chance of surpassing Hysteria.

Once he completely grasped all the secret codes of life, he would become a Genesis World himself. Moreover… he would have more transcendent dimensions than the current Genesis World.

Where did such confidence come from?

Void.

The development of dimensions would require a source of power, right?

However, this source was not the current Genesis World, but the Void.

The Void was infinitely large, so much so that it could even accommodate the Genesis World of the last era and have a lot of room left. But, what was there in the Void?

Fundamental power.

With it as support, if Ling Han were to compete with Hysteria, it wouldn’t be about who started first, but about the rate of absorption of this kind of energy.

Of course, if one started quickly, they would definitely have an advantage, just like Hysteria. Now, it was truly the number one elite in the world. With its strength alone, it could suppress more than 10 ultimate Seventh-Tier elites and simultaneously contend against a transcendent dimension while completely having the upper hand.

“I can definitely catch up!”

Ling Han clenched his fists. What he needed the most now was more secret codes of life, and this required him to find more people having a sphere of light in their minds.

This couldn’t be rushed. They could only wait for the good news.

Ling Han continued to cultivate in seclusion, deducing the Heavenly Venerable Seals. This was equally important as it could allow him to possess even greater battle prowess in a situation where the original power of his opponent was the same as his.

Every time he deduced a Heavenly Venerable Seal, Ling Han would stop and spend some time with his family. Furthermore, there was also Ling Kang’s growth, so he had to accompany him properly. With regards to his first two children, he had actually missed a lot.

Unfortunately, when children grew up, many things weren’t up to the parents.

Ling Kang soon left home and traveled everywhere.

Ling Han didn’t stop him, but condensed a doppelganger to accompany him instead. If his son really encountered an irresolvable crisis, he would naturally make a move.

Although it was only a doppelganger, it had the strength of a Sixth Tier. Would it be unable to protect his son?

After 900,000,000 years, Ling Han had deduced all the fifth-grade seals. If they were channeled together, the increase in power would be as high as 4,000 times.

On the other hand, the dimensions in his body were also growing robustly. Although they had not reached the level of a high-tier high-level dimension, they had made some progress—compared to a total of 10,000 steps, they had probably taken the first step by now.

The entire process would take several epochs. It wouldn’t be any faster, unless Ling Han could obtain more secret codes of life.

As Ling Han worked even more diligently to produce the testing devices, he also cultivated endlessly. Right now, he didn’t need to care about the dimensions within his body. His cultivation speed was extremely astonishing under the boost of several hundred Heavenly Venerable Seals.

After staying for a while longer, he could no longer sit still.

“Let’s go and take a look at Shatter Mountains.”

After hearing his decision, everyone had strange expressions on their faces.

“Little Han, could it be that you and Shatter Mountains truly love each other?” The large black dog stared at him in bewilderment. “This is truly an illness, and it needs to be treated quickly. Don’t worry, we won’t give up on you!”

“Get lost!” Ling Han gave him a kick.

He wanted to know if Shatter Mountains had managed to escape from the Realm Battlefield. Furthermore, he had also decided to go to the Realm Battlefield to have a good fight with Hysteria this time.

“Let’s go, let’s go. You must bring us along this time,” the large black dog goaded.

“That’s right. We can’t miss out on the chance to witness such gay love radiating all over the place,” the old ginseng also chimed in.

“Let’s go, let’s go together.” Rabbit also jumped in excitement.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Alright, all of you can come along.”

Compared to the last time when he had gone to find Shatter Mountains, his current strength hadn’t just increased by more than 10 times—it was probable that even if Chong Yan and the other five ultimate elites were to join forces, they still wouldn’t be his match.

Ling Han brought everyone with him and set off, arriving at the place of enlightenment of Shatter Mountains for the fourth time.

F*ck!

Even Ling Han was slightly stunned. Just how thick-skinned was this Shatter Mountains to actually build another place of enlightenment?

Would the old bastard die if he didn’t open a place of enlightenment?

Ling Han shook his head, and reached the peak of the mountain with a single step.

Upon seeing Ling Han, all the Celestial Kings trembled in fear. They naturally still remembered that Ling Han had barged in and waged war against Shatter Mountains more than 100,000,000 years ago. After that, Shatter Mountains had disappeared for an extremely long time.

Although Shatter Mountains had returned later, his expression was extremely unsightly, allowing them to easily guess that he had definitely suffered a huge loss.

Now, Ling Han was here again.

“Old scoundrel Shatter Mountains, your grandfather is here again. Stop hiding, quickly come out and play!” the large black dog shouted at the top of his lungs, while physically hiding behind Ling Han. After all, Shatter Mountains was a Seventh Tier ultimate elite, so how could he be taken lightly?

Hong, driven by the power of a Heavenly Venerate, this sound reverberated in all directions, with great momentum and rapid speed.

A moment later, a cold snort was heard, and a peerless elite walked out.

Of course, it was Shatter Mountains.

He glanced at the large black dog. Although he didn’t use much power, the large black dog couldn’t help but shrink back under the powerful pressure.

“Old bastard, why are you glaring at Grandpa Dog?” The large black dog glared back. While trying to appear fierce when he was in fact cowardly at heart, he stuck his head out from behind Ling Han. “If you continue glaring, I’ll dig out your damn eyes!”

“You’re courting death!” Shatter Mountains snorted coldly. Was the world in reverse now? Even an anomaly of the Second Tier dared to roar at him?

Boom! Without any hesitation, he launched a palm strike towards the large black dog.

“Little Han, save me!” the large black dog cried out.

Of course, Ling Han wouldn’t hold back. Not only would the large black dog be in trouble, but the old ginseng, rabbit, rock golem, and the others would also be implicated in this attack.

He flicked his finger. Pu, a powerful force shot into the sky, and a hole instantly appeared in the huge palm strike of Shatter Mountains.
