Chapter 1164: Not Interested

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I’m not interested,” Ling Han answered without a moment of hesitation.

Gai Yongsi faltered for a moment before saying, “Senior Brother Han, don’t you want to consider it for a little longer?”

“Is there something wrong with your ears, or is there something wrong with your brain?” Ling Han asked.

Gai Yongsi was flabbergasted. Had he not explained clearly just then? He had said that he was inviting Ling Han to join the Gao Faction on behalf of the young master!

“Do you know how magnificent the Gao Faction is?” He felt that he had to explain further, and so he continued, “Lord Gao Fang, the faction leader, is the fourth disciple of the Venerable Trinity. Moreover, he’s a super-elite at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. In fact, there’s a great chance he’ll advance to the Eternal River Tier in the future!

“Gao Huang, the young master, is also an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. He’ll definitely become a Heavenly Body Tier paragon in the future!”

Ling Han almost burst into laughter. Equating a Heavenly Body Tier elite to a paragon?

Ludicrous!

He shook his head, and said, “Are you done yet?”

“Han Lin, don’t be an ungrateful wretch,” Gai Yongsi said harshly. “You have to realize that Young Master definitely won’t take no for an answer!”

“I’m so scared!” Ling Han said with a smile.

Gai Yongsi was furious. This person actually dared to tease Gao Huang’s name1? He humphed, and said, “If you offend Young Master, it will be difficult for you to take even a single step in the Majestic Heaven Sect! Young Master has only cultivated for 300,000 years, yet he’s already reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. He can definitely break through to the Heavenly Body Tier within 1,000,000 years!”

This was indeed astonishing.

Although 300,000 years seemed like a long time, those at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier already had lifespans of 400,000 years. Meanwhile, the maximum lifespan of Sun Moon Tier elites could reach 4,000,000 years. Thus, reaching the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier in 300,000-odd years was definitely impressive.

However, Ling Han didn’t think much of it. One could indeed be labeled a prodigy if they reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier within 300,000 years. This was quite an astonishing feat, after all. However, in the Majestic Heaven Sect, achieving such a feat wasn’t all that outstanding.

Because this place didn’t lack prodigies.

If Gao Huang’s father hadn’t been a Heavenly Body Tier elite, he wouldn’t necessarily have reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier so quickly. This was similar to Zhao Lun, who was talented, but not the most talented in the world. However, he still managed to reach the Sun Moon Tier within 1,000 years.

Life would be a lot easier if one had a powerful father. However, even though Gao Huang had reached the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier already, it would be almost impossible for him to break through to the Heavenly Body Tier.

If one wasn’t talented enough, it would be impossible for them to reach the Heavenly Body Tier even if they were trained by Heavenly Body Tier elites.

However, the Majestic Heaven Sect had only been founded tens of thousands of years ago, and Venerable Trinity had spent all of his time battling on the Two Realm Battlefield before that. Thus, it was possible that his nine great disciples had battled alongside him. If that was the case, perhaps Gao Huang had also participated in battle before. As such, it was possible that he was indeed quite talented.

Ling Han waved a hand, and said, “Okay, you’ve said everything that you wanted to say, so you can take your leave now. Go on, see yourself out.”

Gai Yongsi shook in anger. This brat was truly arrogant and supercilious!

“Y-you’re far too arrogant.” he stammered angrily. “You’ll definitely regret this... Just wait and see!”

Ling Han’s expression became cold, and he said, “You dare to threaten me?” He turned to Shui Yanyu, and asked, “Wife, this dumb c*nt came to my house and threatened me, so what do you say I should do?”

“Beat him to a pulp, of course!” Ling Han answered his own question before Shui Yanyu could even reply. He flashed a wicked smile at Gai Yongsi. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“D-don’t act recklessly!” Gai Yongsi felt a cold chill run down his spine.

“No need to be so modest!” Ling Han immediately captured Gai Yongsi. Then, loud thumps started to reverberate around his residence as he beat him to his heart’s content.

Ling Han was genuinely ticked off. This was his residence, yet this person had run over and demanded that he become someone else’s underling. After being rejected, he had even dared to threaten him. Wasn’t he asking for a beating?

“Y-y-you... Don’t forget that I’m a member of the Gao Faction!” Gai Yongsi shrieked through his anguished wails.

“I’ll beat you into submission!” Ling Han laughed loudly as he continued to pummel Gai Yongsi.

Lackeys such as Gai Yongsi naturally didn’t possess much backbone. He started to beg for mercy after a while, and he wailed that he wouldn’t dare threaten Ling Han ever again.

Ling Han finally stopped, and said, “I’ll break your dog legs if you ever dare to set foot inside my residence again, understood?”

Gai Yongsi nodded frantically, and said, “Understood! Understood!” His only wish at this moment was to escape from this “demonic lair”.

“Haha, f*ck off then!” Ling Han tossed him out of his residence.

Gai Yongsi stumbled and rolled as he hurriedly crawled up from the ground. He didn’t dare speak another word, and he only turned around after running for a good 100 or so meters. He had initially wanted to throw down a threat, yet a cold chill gripped at his heart when he saw Ling Han’s face. He swallowed the words that were already at the tip of his tongue before turning around and fleeing as quickly as he could.

“How boring!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

Shui Yanyu also shook her head, and said, “Even if you wanted to refuse, couldn’t you have done it in a less offensive manner?”

“I couldn’t contain myself. Just looking at his smug face made me want to beat him,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

Shui Yanyu sighed. She also knew Ling Han’s temperament. However, it was because of his confidence and pride that he was able to improve in leaps and bounds.

“Be careful,” she said.

Ling Han was already a seed, so the sect definitely had high hopes for him. Thus, they definitely wouldn’t allow others to target him too much. It was just that he had to be extremely careful outside the sect.

However, Ling Han had the Black Tower, so protecting himself couldn’t be any easier.

Shui Yanyu felt much more at ease upon thinking of this.

Ling Han left his palace and headed to the town that sat at the foot of the mountain. He wanted to see if there were any higher-grade pill recipes.

Everything was in place now, and he was only missing high-grade pill recipes that would allow him to refine divine pills and earn boatloads of money.

He arrived at the town, and after walking around for a while, he saw the words “Mo Clan Establishment”.

‘Is it that Mo Clan?’ He had been ambushed by several elites before and ended up drifting through the galaxy. It was thanks to his encounter with a Mo Clan’s starship that he had been able to make it to the Flying Cloud Planet. He walked into the store.

A store attendant walked over, and greeted, “Sir, are you looking for anything in particular? Our store has everything, from God Tools to Divine Pills. Or perhaps you’re looking for tool refining materials or alchemical materials? As long as you request it, there’s nothing that we can’t get you!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Are there any pill recipes?”

“Pill recipes?” The store attendant’s expression revealed that he was somewhat troubled.

Due to the special nature of cultivation techniques, pill recipes, and formations, they were rarely ever taken out and sold.

“Are there none?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“How is that possible!” the store attendant said hurriedly. “However, there’s only an extremely limited amount, and they’re all especially dear.”

“Price isn’t an issue,” Ling Han said. He had sold many pills before he left, so he was genuinely not short on money right now. However, there were a lot of places where he needed to spend money—he had several brothers, disciples, and also a lover. Which of them didn’t need cultivation resources?

Most importantly, he needed an exorbitant amount of Godly metal to raise the level of his Divine Demon Sword. How expensive was Godly metal?

“I can’t decide myself. I need to report it to the manager of the store.” The store attendant didn’t dare to sell the pill recipes himself.

“No problem!” Ling Han said with a nod.

It wasn’t long before an elder at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier walked out. A smile appeared on his face when he saw Ling Han, and he said, “Oh, it’s Young Master Han!”

Ling Han was slightly puzzled, and he said, “You know who I am?”

“Naturally. Young Master Han is a rising star of the Majestic Heaven Sect,” the elder complimented. “If I’m unaware of such matters, how can I do business? That’s right, you wanted to buy pill recipes?”

“Correct,” Ling Han said with a nod.

There was a glimmer in the elder’s eyes, and he said, “This might be rude, but may I ask if you’re planning to refine pills yourself?”
