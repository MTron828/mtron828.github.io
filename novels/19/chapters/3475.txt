Chapter 3476: Nine Candidates

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The throne rose into the air.

Xiu, the Essence Nurturing Gourd on Ling Han’s waist was suddenly pulled down by a mysterious power, falling towards the summit.

Ling Han wanted to haul it back, but his body was bound to the throne by a powerful force, so he could only call out, “Eldest Baby, take the gourd and descend the peak first.”

“All right,” Eldest Baby said childishly, running over to catch the gourd.

Ling Han didn’t need to worry. If anyone wanted to snatch it by force, then in a battle of equals, Eldest Baby wouldn’t lose to anyone.

The nine mountain peaks emitted blazing light at the same time, as if they were creating a world of their own, with boundless brilliance.

In the skies, a palace appeared, floating in midair just like that, exuding a boundless aura.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The previous eight thrones also flew towards the palace in the skies.

The nine thrones gathered together, and then landed on a massive plaza in front of the palace. It was paved with white jade-like stone, and could practically be considered reflective.

Ling Han felt his body relax.

Previously, after ascending to the throne, this chair had developed a powerful suction force on him, anchoring him to it. However, losing his freedom for a short while was not a bad thing, because he could sense the astonishing energy that the chair was exuding towards him, improving his physique in all aspects. This was not increasing his cultivation level, but rather improving the essence of his life force, which had many benefits.

Unfortunately, when the restraints of the throne on him disappeared, this kind of improvement also disappeared.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head, and he looked towards the other eight thrones. These people had all sat on them for at least a few days, so how many benefits had they obtained?

He stood up, and stepped onto the plaza.

The other eight people were the same as well, and stood up respectively. Since the benefits were already gone, what meaning was there to continue sitting? Ling Han’s eyes swept over, and saw two familiar faces.

Hong Tianbu and Princess Bixiao.

The other six people were completely unfamiliar to him, and he didn’t recognize any of them.

“The fifth summit is really weak. Someone has only emerged victorious after we have waited for so many days,” a man said disdainfully. He had the head of a tiger, and his ferocious might was overwhelming.

“It allowed you to enjoy the benefits for a few more days, are you still not satisfied?” An incredibly sturdy man asked smilingly, the black and white around his eyes on his bear’s head drawing the attention of others.

“Pei, there’s only a total of three days, and there won’t be any benefits after that. It’s not like you don’t know,” the tiger-headed person scoffed, his eyes fixed on Ling Han, having a terrifying viciousness. “A mere Extreme Bone Tier actually won. Just what kind of trash are those at the fifth peak? No wonder they’re so slow!”

“Hu Taifeng, he is Ling Han,” another man said. A pair of massive wings sprouted from his back, and his feet were bare. Upon a closer look, those were basically a pair of claws, exuding a coldness like fine iron.

Ling Han’s eyes turned cold. The Demon Race had four great prodigies, Hu Er, Hu Taifeng, Xiong Bao, and Ying Pokong. Then, corresponding to each of them, this tiger-headed person must be Hu Taifeng, the bear-headed person was Xiong Bao, and the bird-headed person was Ying Pokong.

The Demon Race was indeed powerful. It was not just empty words that they could crush humans below Celestial Path, and added with Princess Bixiao, they had already occupied at least four places. Furthermore, it was said that Hu Er was even stronger, so he definitely would not be squeezed out.

He swept an eye over the group of eight, his gaze locked on an indescribably handsome man.

This man was so handsome that even women would be envious. If he was dressed in women’s clothing, he would definitely be an exceptional beauty. He had a kind of beauty that surpassed gender, and could be considered both handsome and beautiful.

Hu Er.

‘Why so sure?’

That was because he had a pair of furry ears, as well as a tail that stuck out, but this did not affect his charm in the slightest.

Hu Er, the top elite of the younger generation of the Demon Race, a Mystery Realm Tier.

Ling Han didn’t know who was stronger between himself and Princess Bixiao, but if the two of them were to fight now, it would be a fair battle, and he would definitely lose.

Even if he had really advanced into Seventh Extreme, or even stepped onto Inscription Tier, it was still impossible for him to be a match for a Mystery Realm Tier elite at present.

Well, just the Demon Race alone had taken up five spots, and added with him and Hong Tianbu, there were only two people whose identities were still unknown.

He looked over. The two of them were a man and a woman respectively. The man had a slender figure, and should be a pure human. He was also very handsome, but with Hu Er there, probably no one would dare call themselves a handsome man.

There was also a woman. Er, to say nothing of whether she was beautiful or not, just her figure alone was enough to scare anyone to death.

Strong.

She was at least as sturdy as four Ling Han’s added together. One of her arms was as thick as a normal person’s thigh, and there were only two pieces of animal hide wrapped around her, revealing a large part of her skin. However, it was obviously impossible to attract anyone’s attention. This kind of “beauty” was still something to be avoided. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

There was also a spiked club slung behind her back, and her eyes were like copper bells, as if she would strike anyone that she did not like with her spiked club.

“Have you guys realized that there is an additional mark on your wrist?” Ying Pokong did not continue to be conflicted about the issue of Ling Han. That was because according to rumors, this brat had an unclear relationship with Her Imperial Highness, the Princess, and was not someone that they could simply gossip about.

“That’s right. What is this thing? I can’t even see it now.” Hu Taifeng nodded.

Ling Han also lowered his head. Just now, when he was descending from the throne, he had indeed discovered that there was an additional mark on his wrist. It disappeared in a flash, and added with the fact that he had obtained the cultivation technique from the mural, he had already been given two “stamps”.

“Who cares!” Xiong Bao looked at Ling Han, Hong Tianbu and the other humans, “If you ask me, let’s kill these four humans first!”

“All right, the candidate for Young Dragon can only belong to us, the Demon Race. Humans, step aside.” Ying Pokong nodded.

Hong Tianbu stood, arms crossed behind his back, and said calmly, “If you want to die, just make your move.”

These simple words were filled with intimidation.

Princess Bixiao waved a hand, and said, “We’re still unclear about the situation inside. Let’s enter the palace first.”

“Yes, Your Highness!” Xiong Bao, Ying Pokong, and Hu Er all nodded. They were very respectful in front of this Demon Race princess. Even Hu Er bowed slightly to express his respect for Princess Bixiao.

“Let me introduce myself. I’m Wu Lidong,” the lanky human said.

“I am Mei Hua,” the sturdy woman said as well. Her voice boomed like thunder, and she even patted her chest, causing waves to ripple.

‘It must be muscles,’ Ling Han said with absolute certainty, as he mocked, ‘Have plum blossoms done any offense to you? Why do you have to make things difficult for plum blossoms? If you do this, I’ll have a different opinion of plum blossoms in future.?’

“Ling Han,” he replied.

Hong Tianbu, meanwhile, was proud, as if it was beneath him to associate with them.

“Who is that guy? He looks so conceited,” Mei Hua covered her mouth with her hand and asked quietly. However, her voice was only slightly softer than an ordinary person’s holler.

Hong Tianbu naturally heard it very clearly, and he couldn’t help but frown slightly, a sliver of killing intent circulating within him.

Ling Han chuckled, “A conceited guy.”

“Ling Han, are you seeking death?” Hong Tianbu asked coldly.

Ling Han immediately shouted exaggeratedly, and said, “Bixiao dear, someone is trying to murder your husband!”
