1391 Large Black Dog

Looking closely, this was indeed a dog. A large black dog that was countless times larger than ordinary dogs.

The old man’s hand came into contact with the large black dog, triggering a burst of dazzling light and causing nine brilliant halos to surge from its body. The large black dog shuddered and instantly stopped snoring.

It opened its eyes, appearing dazed at first. Then, upon seeing the old man, a tense look flashed across its eyes.

“You scared the sh*t out of Grandpa Dog! What the hell!” The large black dog suddenly jumped up and raced away. However, the ninth level was far too small, so he immediately crashed into the boundary and was sent reeling back.

“My dog!” The old man continued to reach over to stroke the large black dog.

“Holy sh*t! Save me! What the hell!” The large black dog continued to avoid the old man, running in circles around the level. However, he was far too ginormous, and the space in the ninth level was far too limited. It wasn’t long before he ran a full circle around the level and caught up to the human skin old man from behind.

“I’ll shrink!” The large black dog shook his body and instantly started to shrink in size, becoming as large as a normal dog. His fur bristled as he frantically fled from the old man.

Ling Han couldn’t help but cluck in amusement. The old man had relentlessly harped on about his dog, and sure enough, there truly was a dog here.

The old man continued to pursue the dog. He had grasped the Regulations of space, so he could cover dozens of kilometers in a single stride even though he didn’t appear very quick. He reached over to grab the tail of the large black dog.

“Save me!” the large black dog exclaimed upon seeing Ling Han. He immediately dashed toward Ling Han.

Killing intent oozed from the old man, and he said, “You dare to steal my dog?” Tears of blood rolled out from his empty eye sockets. This was a petrifying sight.

‘Motherf*cker! I’m innocent!’

Ling Han immediately started to flee from the large black dog.

However, the large black dog was far too evil, and he continued to chase after Ling Han.

“F*ck! Sh*tty dog, why are you following me!!” Ling Han shouted.

“What is life without exercise? Running can keep one healthy,” the large black dog said seriously. It was clear that he didn’t feel any guilt at all.

‘Fine, this is another degenerate being.’

Ling Han really wanted to facepalm. Why couldn’t he come across more normal beings?

“Return my dog!” Tears of blood were streaming down the old man’s face, each drop that splattered to the ground transforming into a lake of blood. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before this level became a sea of blood.

“Sh*tty dog, that old man is clearly your owner! Hurry up and leave with him!” Ling Han exclaimed.

“Pei! You’re a sh*tty dog! Your entire family consists of sh*tty digs! If you want to follow him so badly, then please go and do so! I have no relationship with this human-skinned monster!” the large black dog shouted in a strange voice. Meanwhile, he continued to run as fast as the wind.

This large black dog was truly a special breed. He was only at the Heavenly Body Tier, yet his speed was no slower than Ling Han’s.

“F*ck that dog!” Ling Han was speechless, and he could only continue to flee from the large black dog.

“Woof! You want to f*ck me? See how I bite you to death!” The large black dog immediately widened its maws and bit toward Ling Han, catching Ling Han’s leg. “Owww! Stinky brat, what in the world are you made out of? Why are you as tough as Divine Metal?”

Ling Han bared his teeth in pain. His physique was indeed tough, yet this large black dog was also a very special breed. His bite had actually caused him to feel slight pain! “Sh*tty dog, let go of me! Let go of me!”

“Grrrr, I’m going to f*ck you to death! No, bite you to death!” The large black dog was a dog who would harbor grudges for a very long time.

Ling Han frantically shook his leg, and shouted, “Sh*tty dog, let go! The old freak is catching up!” The large black dog was incredibly heavy, and this greatly affected his speed. However, the grip of this dog was truly astonishing, and he couldn’t be shaken off no matter what.

“I’ll let go if you pay me a compensation of 10,000 pieces of Divine Metal!” The large black dog made an exorbitant demand.

“F*ck off!”

Ling Han felt that he was already very good at swindling people. However, compared to this dog, he was like a man of great morals. Even the old ginseng and rabbit couldn’t compare to this large black dog.

As the saying went, there were skies beyond skies, and there were mountains beyond mountains.

The blood tears of the old man had already formed numerous lakes around the ninth level. Moreover, they were starting to connect together now, transforming from numerous small lakes into one large lake. At this rate, it would only be a matter of time before the entire ninth level was covered in a sea of blood.

Not only that, but these bodies of blood were also extremely terrifying. Ling Han didn’t dare to run over them at all. With just a single glance, he could already sense the harrowing murderous aura that was emanating from the blood. This blood could definitely dissolve him in an instant.

He ran through the air, yet the large black dog’s incredible weight was significantly slowing him down. It was as if he were running with a mountain on his back.

“Sh*tty dog, I’m about to get serious!” Ling Han threw a punch toward the large black dog, even imbuing the power of heaven’s lightning in his strike.

“Freak!” The large black dog hurriedly let go of him in fright. He was indeed strong, yet he was still afraid of being struck by heaven’s lightning. He would be severely wounded even if he wasn’t killed.

Anyhow, how could a human wield heaven’s might? If he wasn’t a freak, then what was he?

Ling Han activated the Star Plucking Step and tried to keep as far away from the large black dog as possible. However, if he genuinely ran out of options, he would immediately enter the Black Tower. He naturally couldn’t sacrifice his life for the sake of keeping the Black Tower a secret.

However, the large black dog was truly evil, still continuing to pursue Ling Han. Meanwhile, the human skin old man chased after the two of them.

The blood lakes merged and drowned out the entire ninth level.

The old man was far too powerful, and even the palace of the ninth level was unable to withstand his power. The walls of the palace were rapidly eroded amid the tumultuous sea of blood.

“Has the time... already arrived?” a childish voice suddenly said. This voice slowly reverberated throughout the entire level.

The old man immediately stopped, and the hair of the large black dog all stood on ends. Meanwhile, Ling Han wore a very strange expression. He realized that he had been swept up in some very mysterious matter.

‘Why me again?’ RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A column of light burst from the palace, immediately evaporating the sea of blood. The desolate land appeared before them once more.

“Who are you?” the human skin old man asked.

“You should be asking, ‘who am I’,” the childish voice replied. However, there was haughtiness in this voice, and it was as if it belonged to some transcendent and paramount god.

“Who am I?” the human skin old man asked in confusion.

“You’re the sheet of skin that I shed in my fifth life,” the childish voice replied. However, this reply sent chills down Ling Han’s spine.

Ling Han had initially thought that the old man had been ruthlessly skinned after coming across some supremely powerful enemy. However, judging by this reply, he was a sheet of skin that had been voluntarily shed. Moreover, it was shed in the fifth life of this person...

‘This person has already lived for five lives?

‘Hang on, there are nine levels in the Medicine King’s Cave... Could it be that this person created a new level with each life that he lived?

‘Moreover, the nine Heavenly Origin Dao Fruits are all fused with something. Gasp! Perhaps they’re fused with the body or divine sense of this person?!

‘Nine nines return to one... What kind of freak is going to be born in this life?’

“So... that’s how it is!” the human skin old man murmured. He sat down, bursts of brilliant light pulsating around his body. He was returning to dao[1].

He had only remained alive due to his two obsessions—he wanted to know who he was, and he wanted to find his dog. Now that he had found his dog and learned of his identity, these obsessive thoughts naturally evaporated into nothingness. As such, it was only natural that he’d return to dao. After all, he wasn’t a genuine living being.

Ling Han felt as if he were facing a great enemy. It was extremely likely that this mysterious person had already lived through nine lives. However, where had he obtained so many Reincarnation Flowers from? How did he manage to live one life after the next?

“Heh, young man, you’re overthinking things,” the childish voice suddenly said. “I managed to live one life after the next due to my own strength and power. However, I could only live for 1,000,000 years in each of my previous lives. After planting and cultivating the spirits of my nine previous lives, I managed to nurture the true body of my 10th life. During this life, I’ll definitely stun the world and rewrite history!”

[1] “Returning to dao” essentially means accepting death.
