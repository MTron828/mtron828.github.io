Chapter 1783: Bewitching Maiden Rou

Fu Gaoyun naturally wouldn’t believe him.

Bewitching Maiden Rou had very great airs. It was rare that she was willing to invite someone to see her, yet you directly ignored the messenger. Who would pay you any further regard?

However, Fu Gaoyun would not say these words right in front of Ling Han, and could only smile bitterly. Thanks to Ling Han, he had already seen Bewitching Maiden Rou once. Though he still wanted to see her a second and third time, he had still seen her, after all, so there was no need for any regrets.

Yet, a while later, the woman in white was seen coming back.

This time, her face was plastered with a smile, and when she saw Ling Han, she curtsied slightly, and delicately said, “My name is Jingyue. Previously, I have offended Young Master. Please do not remember my fault, Young Master! As long as Young Master is willing to forgive me, you may beat or scold me as you like.”

Fu Gaoyun’s mouth suddenly gaped widely, his eyes wide, stuck in complete disbelief.

This was the personal female attendant of Bewitching Maiden Rou, and she really could be considered very proud. She did not even pay much regard to him, an heir of the Fu Clan, but now actually said that Ling Han could beat her or scold her as he liked. This was too much of an exaggeration, right?

Gasp!

He was also a smart man, and so immediately realized that the cultivation technique that Bewitching Maiden Rou had taken out for them to restore was extraordinary. Otherwise, he could not have imagined any reason that Bewitching Maiden Rou would have this female attendant bow her head.

Later, he definitely had to tell Ling Han that he should not just be occupied with restoring the cultivation technique, but would have to memorize this cultivation technique completely as well; it was too important.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “Without rhyme or reason, why should I beat or scold you?”

“Young Master...” The woman in white directly knelt down, and lowered her upper body. From Ling Han’s position, he could clearly see through to the stretch of snow white at her collar, as well as those two slightly rounded parts. Though only a bit was revealed, it would linger in memory, and fill a man with the urge to see even more.

Hoho, she was using a charm technique on him?

Ling Han closed his eyes, not even wanting to speak any further.

“Young Master, I really recognize my mistake!” When the woman in white saw this, her expression changed repeatedly.

Previously, when she had returned to make her report, she had been reprimanded by Bewitching Maiden Rou, who commanded that she definitely had to be polite to Ling Han, and she was to invite him over at all costs. But she was still very defiant, and thought that she only had to use her charm technique, and Ling Han would definitely give in to her obediently.

This time, she knew that she had completely read Ling Han wrongly, and was so scared that she began to repeatedly kowtow. “Young Master is a magnanimous man, so please spare me!”

Peng, peng, peng. Her forehead knocked endlessly on the floor boards, creating a very loud sound.

Ling Han was amenable to coaxing, but not coercion. Since she had already bowed her head and admitted her fault, and furthermore, it was only disdaining him for a short while previously, he did not bother about her too much. His slender figure rose, and he said, “Fine then. I will go meet with your sect’s Holy Daughter.”

Fu Gaoyun couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up mentally. Usually, it would only be others that would be begging to meet Bewitching Maiden Rou. When had it been that Bewitching Maiden Rou would turn around to beg someone to meet her?

Impressive.

The Empress walked over. She, too, wanted to meet this Bewitching Maiden Rou, and see how she compared with herself.

At first, the woman in white wanted to stop her, but after taking a look at Ling Han, she obediently closed her mouth.

It was best not to offend Ling Han now.

The four of them flew over to the Purity Sect’s battleship together.

On the great ship, there were a great many women patrolling. Because the woman in white was leading them, none of them called them to a halt and asked their business. After boarding the vessel, they soon arrived in front of the largest room inside.

“Please wait for a while,” the woman in white said. She delivered a knock on the doors to the room, and a languid voice rang out from within after a while. “Come in.”

This voice was very low, but it could be clearly heard. It was like being scratched by a kitten, causing an itch in the heart of anyone who heard this voice.

There was no need to see the actual speaker. Merely this voice alone could enchant the senses, and cause one’s mind to be filled with endless fantasies. What kind of enchanting beauty was this?

The woman in white pushed the doors open, and then extended her hand to Ling Han and his companion to show them the way in.

Fu Gaoyun was the first to enter, while Ling Han and the Empress walked in together. The moment they entered, they saw a woman who was presently lying on top of a massive rattan chair.

She was wearing a pale yellow long skirt, her complexion snow white, and her beautiful face was astonishingly exquisite. Compared to the Empress, she was only slightly inferior. However, her eyes were really too seductive, as if they had a life of their own, or as if they could talk and showed her soul, causing one’s heart to beat faster.

Since she was lying down, she naturally was not wearing shoes or any socks. She revealed two beautiful dainty feet that were as smooth as jade, her toenails all pink. That was not because she had painted them, but due to their natural appearance.

However, most of the beautiful legs were hidden within her long skirt, and only a small bit was revealed. Yet, it was more enchanting like this.

And Ling Han could confirm through this one look that she was definitely a great beauty. Though her beauty was inferior compared to Hu Niu and the Empress, the charm technique that she had cultivated greatly increased her personal charm, so in truth, she was not too far behind, either.

No wonder that whether it was Fu Gaoyun and other such young king tiers, or elites from the older generation, they all wished to keep her as their mistress. If Ling Han had still been a lonely bachelor, he, too, might’ve begun to fiercely court this woman as well.

But now? He withdrew his gaze, his eyes clear.

He sat down with the Empress, their hands still holding together. This was practically a torture to singles.

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but feel surprised. It was not that she had not seen men pretend to be reserved in front of her, but which one of them had been truly reserved? Hadn’t they all just wanted to deliberately draw her notice, and were just taking the opposite route? She had seen many men of this type, so she was unperturbed by their tricks.

But Ling Han did not appear to be putting on a pretense of reservedness. His eyes were too frighteningly clear. Otherwise, no matter how much he pretended, she would still be able to see ***** in his eyes. Just take Fu Gaoyun, who was sitting by his side, as an example. Though he was a king tier of the present generation, he was still unable to conceal his desire.

“So this is Ling Han, Young Master Ling?” Her face bore a faint smile, not as proud as the Empress, nor as clingy as Hu Niu, yet it contained strongly her personal charisma in her expression.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I am Ling Han.”

“I heard that Young Master Ling helped Young Master Fu to restore that incomplete chant?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

Ling Han did not want to bother wasting time on trivialities with her, and said, “If you want me to help you restore the entire technique, I can. Take out that cultivation technique, and allow me to study it slowly.”

This...

Bewitching Maiden Rou showed a hint of hesitation.

She had obtained that cultivation technique in coincidental circumstances, but because it was unbearably incomplete, she did not dare to cultivate it rashly. Otherwise, the consequences would be extremely severe. The higher the grade of the celestial technique, the more dangerous it was.

But she had a feeling that this cultivation technique was very extraordinary.

She did not mind taking out a single page for others to study. In any case, it was only a single page. No one could possibly infer the previous contents or the contents after through this one page, but if she took out the entire cultivation technique, that would have too many implications.

But if it could not be restored completely, it would be useless even if she guarded the cultivation technique firmly.

Thus, after a long moment of thought, she still nodded slowly, and said, “All right!” She glanced at Ling Han, slightly angry. This guy actually didn’t even want to bother talking with her, and instead wanted to immediately begin restoring the cultivation technique. She was really about to die from fury!

What an insensitive blockhead!
