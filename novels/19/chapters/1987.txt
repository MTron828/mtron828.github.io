This was really too shameless.

Just to show off his superiority in front of Ma Tongguang, Ling Han actually had people come to act as his admirers. This was really shamelessness without any lower limit.

Ma Tongguang smirked coldly. Did Ling Han think that just because he had found someone to put on an act, Ma Tongguang would fall for it?

He was really too dumb, and too naive.

He swept an eye over these “actors”. They were all very young, and they were all only One-Star Alchemists. They did not have any weight to speak of.

Tsk, couldn’t you find someone with some more weight to put on the act?

“Grandmaster Ling!” Ma Tongguang had not finished this thought when he saw yet another person walk over. He was similarly very young, but the badge worn on his chest showed that his identity was a Two-Star Alchemist.

Ling Han nodded smilingly. In the past, he had given a lecture, and explained the basics of alchemy, benefiting who knew how many people. Even Three-Star Alchemists were very grateful to him, and called him grandmaster, which was proof of Ling Han’s prestige.

However, it was easy for others to remember Ling Han, but if Ling Han had to remember each and every one of these admirers, that would really be too hard. Furthermore, he had not deliberately made the effort to memorize their names, either. At that time, he had left after he had finished his lecture, and did not use this chance to establish a prestigious reputation for himself.

“I am Sun Feng.” This young man hurriedly introduced himself. “After I listened to Grandmaster Ling’s lecture, I have been filled with gratitude towards Grandmaster Ling. However, I have not had the chance to express my thanks towards Grandmaster Ling. I had not thought that I would actually be able to come to the Yang Soul Ocean together with Grandmaster Ling this time. It really is my honor.”

“Brother Sun.” Ling Han smiled slightly at him.

“No! No!” Sun Feng hurriedly said very humbly, his tone bearing excitement. Being able to gain the recognition of his idol really made him too elated.

Yi, this act was really quite real!

Ma Tongguang saw this, and couldn’t help but smirk internally. He had just thought that the previous actors did not bear enough weight, and he had not expected a second one had immediately come over.

Fine then, just continue with your pretense.

“Master Ling!”

“Master Ling!”

“Master Ling!”

“...”

More and more people spotted Ling Han, and all came over, greeting Ling Han warmly. Furthermore, those that could garner a nod from Ling Han all looked extremely excited, appearing to be incredibly pleased.

From the initial more than dozen people to several dozens of people, to over 100, and then several hundred... There was practically an ocean of people surrounding Ling Han. In fact, Ma Tongguang and Lu Xianming had even been pushed out of the crowd.

F***, what was going on here?

Ma Tongguang was a little blank. With the memory of a Celestial, he naturally remembered clearly just how many people had boarded the warship, and he was certain that there was not one person among them that had disembarked from the warship.

It would have been easy to set up one or two actors, but several hundred to over 1,000 would be difficult.

Moreover, these people were all peak-stage Severing Mundane Tiers.

Ma Tongguang suddenly realized that he had underestimated Ling Han. This Holy Son of Alchemy City did not seem like an ordinary character.

Perhaps it was not that he had underestimated Ling Han, but had rather underestimated the entire Eastern Celestial Realm, and had thus thought that anyone coming from this place was lowly and lacking in ability. He only had to show some of his domineering aura, and he would be able to make them submit to him easily.

The truth had proven that a few prodigies would emerge from a place, and there would be a rare few individuals that were stunning without compare.

Viciousness flashed through his eyes.

Ma Tongguang was fond of taking in prodigies, and the prouder they were, the more challenging they would be to him. However, when someone had reached an extent capable of posing a threat to him, he would no longer bear the intention of taking them as subordinate. Instead, he would erase them without mercy.

Ling Han seemed to have this kind of tendency.

What made Ma Tongguang even more uncomfortable was the fact that there were more and more people coming over to pay their greetings to Ling Han. In fact, they were not just Two-Star Alchemists. Even a few Three-Star Alchemists had come over, all of them gray-haired and aged, suffering the torture of the Immortal’s Tribulation. If they did not break through to the Dividing Soul Tier, the end of their lifespan would be close at hand.

Three-Star Alchemists!

Ma Tongguang finally lost his calm composure. He was indeed an alchemy prodigy. He had practiced alchemy for less than a million years, and had already become a Three-Star Alchemist. In fact, this was something that even a considerable number of Four-Star Alchemists could not have hoped to do in the past.

But to have a Three-Star Alchemist bow down to him in worship?

Sorry, this was a completely impossible feat. All of them were of the same level, so who would come and bow to him?

The world of alchemy did not have a rule that stated that others should come to bow to you because you were a prodigy.

Yet Ling Han had accomplished this!

This caused envy to rise up in Ma Tongguang’s heart, and his killing intent blazed.

‘Die!’ he declared internally, completely dismissing the thought of taking Ling Han as subordinate.

He had to erase Ling Han, and it had to be done as soon as possible, at all costs. Otherwise, when Ling Han went to the Western Celestial Realm, who knew if mighty figures of alchemy would take note of Ling Han, and thus take him in as disciple. By then, it would no longer be possible to get rid of Ling Han.

No one would dare.

Lu Xianming caught sight of the changes in Ma Tongguang’s expression, and smirked internally.

He had long since predicted that Ma Tongguang had only been carried away by his own wishful thinking. In the end, he would still turn hostile to Ling Han, just like how Lu Xianming had once done. However, at the time, his heart had been too soft, and he had not dealt a fatal blow at the first instance. In the end, when he was about to rise in revolt, Ling Han’s victory was already established, and he was too late.

He hoped that Ma Tongguang would definitely not follow in his footsteps this time.

Ling Han became a center of focus. As long as they were alchemists, they would come to greet him. Even if there were some among them that had not gone to participate in the celebration, they had still heard a retelling from others later. They, too, were very grateful to Ling Han, and as word spread, Ling Han’s reputation became more and more resounding.

Fortunately, alchemists were ultimately rare and few, and there were even fewer that just happened to be at the peak stage of the Severing Mundane Tier. A few days later, peace returned to Ling Han.

“Brother Ling, you are more awesome than I am,” Yan Xianlu said sincerely. “In the past, though I have been called the strongest of the young generation of the Calm Peace Heaven, with countless people admiring me, that was only just limited to the Calm Peace Heaven, but you have already reached the extent of the entire Eastern Celestial Realm, Brother Ling.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “It is just a coincidence.”

“Niu’s Ling Han is the best!” Hu Niu declared cheerily without the slightest bit of reservation as she clung onto one of Ling Han’s arms.

“Brother Ling is indeed awesome. However, the Three Capitals Heaven can be ranked in the middle echelon in the Eastern Celestial Realm, and has countless prodigies,” Yan Xianlu said solemnly. “Their strongest prodigy is called ‘The Madman’, and his real name is Lu Heng. He is well known as a maniac of cultivation. The moment he gets into a fight, he is completely oblivious to all else. It is said that there is not a single person in the Three Capitals Heaven that does not fear him.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel intrigued, and said, “Then, I really would like to meet him.”

Yan Xianlu was first startled, and then smiled in spite of himself. “I should have thought so. Brother Ling is that type of person.”

In truth, he himself was that kind of character too. However, he had gone on a trip to the Wide Prosperity Heaven, and had found out that he really was a frog at the bottom of a well. Thus, he faced them as a competitor, no longer the high and noble king waiting for those inferior to him to issue challenges he had once been.

Since they had the free time now, Yan Xianlu began to speak of some “glorious” affairs of Lu Heng.

When Ling Han heard this, he was sure that Lu Heng’s name, ‘The Madman’, was definitely not rashly given. He indeed was incredibly crazy. This was a monster that lived on battle.

“Hey, hey, hey, have you heard?!” someone suddenly exclaimed in a high voice.

When someone said these words, he had to be certain that others did not know what he was going to say, so he could satisfy his vanity, making everyone look towards him.

True enough, when everyone looked over, that person showed a proud smile, and said, “The latest news, the Madman has just been defeated.”
