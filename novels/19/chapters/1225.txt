Chapter 1226: Arrival of the Level Seven Alchemist

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The appraisal quickly returned a result.

Alchemy skills and appraisal skills were two different matters. Even Level One alchemists—or non-alchemists, for that matter—could be skilled in appraising alchemical pills. This simply required one to have a good understanding of alchemical pills.

Ling Han had achieved a resounding victory!

He Jingyun’s Explosive Thunder Pills barely reached six stars, while Ling Han’s reached a whopping nine stars.

It wasn’t perfect, but that was because Ling Han hadn’t used the Three Fire Guide. After all, he didn’t want his disciples to guess his identity yet.

He Jingyun looked completely demoralized. He had lost, and lost in emphatic fashion, no less. The gulf between him and Ling Han was huge.

“Please!” Ling Han said with a smile.

‘You’ve lost, so it’s time for you to crawl out of this street.’

He Jingyun humphed before turning around to leave. He was too embarrassed to stay here.

“Oi, oi, oi, use all four limbs, not just your two legs,” Ling Han said.

He Jingyun glanced back, and said in a proud voice, “You want to make me, a Level Six alchemist, crawl out— Aaah!”

Before he could even finish his sentence, Ling Han had already walked over and lifted him up, forcing him to spread his arms and his legs. He couldn’t break free from Ling Han’s grip no matter what. He couldn’t help but feel shocked. One had to realize that he was at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, which was the same cultivation level as Ling Han’s. Yet, he couldn’t even resist?

“I hate dishonest people the most!” Ling Han flung him to the floor, and said, “It was your own suggestion, so you’ve got to abide by it even if it means eating sh*t!”

“If you dare to touch even a single hair of mine, believe me, the Treasure Forest Pavilion will crush you into pieces!” He Jingyun said in a threatening voice. If he had to crawl on the street in public, that would be humiliating not just for himself, but also for the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Oh no, I’m so scared!” He then kicked He Jingyun, and shouted, “Crawl!”

He Jingyun obviously wasn’t willing to do so. If he crawled, he really wouldn’t be able to show his face anymore.

“What the f*ck are you? Are your promises farts from your mouth?” Ling Han continued to stomp on He Jingyun’s face as he spoke. However, He Jingyun finally became “tough” for once, sticking his head between the cracked tiles in the floor. He was going to cower from Ling Han’s attacks.

Although having his face stomped on wasn’t anything glorious, it was at least still better than crawling along the street in public.

“Grandmaster Ling, it’s about time you stopped,” Alchemist Hu and the others said in persuasion.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Fine! Which of you is going to crawl out of the street for him? I’ll let him go if any of you volunteer.”

The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion all exchanged a glance. They then shook their heads in unison. What a joke—He Jingyun cared about face, so why wouldn’t they care about face too?

“Hurry up and call for reinforcements!”

They attempted to keep Ling Han in check as they waited for the Treasure Forest Pavilion’s reinforcements.

Ling Han didn’t mind this. Even if He Jingyun didn’t crawl out of this street, he would still lose all face after being stomped on by him.

After a while, the reinforcements from the Treasure Forest Pavilion finally arrived.

“Stop!” a cultivator shouted. There wasn’t a hint of medicinal smell on his body, so he definitely wasn’t an alchemist. Two complete Suns and Moons materialized behind him, signifying that he was at the peak stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

“Fine!” Ling Han answered cooperatively. However, he continued to stomp on He Jingyun aggressively.

“I told you to keep your hands off him!” the elite shouted in rage. He reached over and grabbed at Ling Han.

Ling Han swung his fist in reply, smiling, and said, “I did keep my hands off him. However, you didn’t tell me to keep my feet off him.”

Peng!

Their strikes collided, and Ling Han suddenly sunk down. His power was on par with the late stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, though this was still 10 times weaker than the peak stage. However, his physique was incredibly powerful, so he was completely unaffected by the strike.

Meanwhile, his foot was still resting on He Jingyun’s body. The force of their strikes instantly coursed through him and traveled into He Jingyun’s body.

Pa, pa, pa!

The tiles on the floor exploded into smithereens, and He Jingyun’s body instantly disappeared underground. Even his shadow couldn’t be seen.

“You...!!” The elite flared up in rage. He was a protection officer at the Treasure Forest Pavilion, and although his strength wasn’t in the top echelon, he should have still been able to crush Ling Han, who was only at the early stage of the Sun Moon Tier.

However, the reality was completely different from his expectations.

“Heh, want to come again?” Ling Han said as he swept his gaze around. This elite wasn’t the only backup that had come. Among the reinforcements from the Treasure Forest Pavilion, there were also several alchemists who had clearly been involved in alchemy for too long. In fact, the medicinal smell on their bodies could even be seen.

This medicinal smell formed an aura that steamed behind their bodies, much like a dense mist.

“Young lad, you’re not going to tell me that you’re a Level Seven alchemist, right?” an elder said with a humph. There was a disbelieving look in his eyes.

Although Big Trade City was very large, it was only a small city from the perspective of the entire Imperial Empire. This was evident when looking at the surrounding forces. The most powerful force near this city, the Cloud Phoenix Sect, merely had an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Thus, the most skillful alchemist assigned to this Treasure Forest Pavilion branch was only a Level Seven alchemist. Level Eight alchemists would occasionally come here to refine some pills depending on the branch’s needs. After all, there were only a few elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier in this place, so there was no need to refine too many Level Eight Divine Pills. If they refined too many, whom would they sell them to?

This elder’s surname was Li, and he was one of the three Level Seven alchemists who remained stationed at this Treasure Forest Pavilion branch. He had already stagnated at this level for almost 2,000,000 years, and it was extremely likely that he would never become a Level Eight alchemist. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, he was very senior, so he was naturally very conceited.

Right now, it was possible that this young lad—who was heaven knew how much younger than him—was a Level Seven alchemist. How could he not be jealous?

Ling Han chuckled in scorn, and said, “Old geezer, all your years of experience may as well have been wasted on a dog! You’re unable to improve, yet you’re becoming jealous of others. This is very bad!”

“You!!” Alchemist Li almost exploded in anger, and chided, “You have no respect for your elders! Despicable!”

“No respect?” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “We’re all Level Seven alchemists, so how is there any notion of seniority relevant? Respect is earned, not demanded!”

“Fine, this elder will have a match with you!” Alchemist Li roared. He was so furious that even his white hair billowed in the air. It was as if he wanted to swallow Ling Han alive.

“As you wish!” Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Do you want to bet anything?” He looked at He Jingyun—who was still under his foot—as he asked this.

A string of curses raced through He Jingyun’s mind.

Alchemist Li humphed, and said, “If you lose, immediately piss off out of Big Trade City—forever!”

“Fine! If you lose, then please piss off out as well!” Ling Han said calmly.

“Grandmaster Li!” The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion hurriedly urged him to rethink his wager. This young man was far too freakish, and his skills were especially profound. Making such a wager was far too rash.

“Humph, you people don’t trust my skills?” Alchemist Li asked. There was a look of intense displeasure on his face as he glanced at the others.

The people from the Treasure Forest Pavilion all wiped the sweat off their forehead. They had all witnessed Ling Han’s abilities before, and this young man couldn’t be judged according to his appearance and age. His alchemy skills were simply unfathomable.

‘If you’re defeated, won’t you lose all face?’

“Brat, show me what you’ve got. Today, I’ll let you know the importance of age and experience!” Alchemist Li started to provoke Ling Han.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Seeing as you’re so old, I’ll choose my pill first. I’m going to refine the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill.”

Pu!

Alchemist Li instantly spluttered loudly.
