Chapter 3546: A series of traps

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

This should have been arranged by Hong Tianbu, aiming for his Void Beast hide, Heavenly Pattern Jade and the broken piece of tombstone.

Heh, as expected, the person who understood him the most was still his

enemy.

Hong Tianbu could be considered a strong opponent. His natural talent in cultivation was extremely high, his luck was extremely good, and his intelligence was always present.

Interesting.

Ling Han resolutely gave up on the idea of attacking, and thought that it was fortunate that Hong Tianbu’s plans weren’t any more vicious. If there was only one Mystery Realm Tier here, he would have deliberately lured him into attacking, and have a large number of elites spread out in the surroundings. Then, it was really possible that he would fall for it.

“… I say, why did you pull the two of us over?” The three of them were conversing.

“That’s right. Don’t forget, you are the bait.”

“F***, I can’t forget the scene of Ma Qiuling being knocked unconscious. That brat has a treasure that can hide himself. What if I die? If I die, whatever treasure there is would have nothing to do with me.

“But you can’t call us over arbitrarily, right?

“That’s right.”

“Hehe, why don’t we exchange? Which of you two will stand guard here? I’ll go to the back.”

When Ling Han heard this, he couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. It wasn’t that Hong Tianbu hadn’t thought of this, but rather that these people had screwed up on their own!

What a vicious guy. He had already predicted Ling Han’s intentions. He knew that Ling Han would even dare to make a move if he encountered a single Mystery Realm Tier all alone. Who asked him to have a stomach full of anger?

But if he made a move, he would really have fallen into Hong Tianbu’s trap.

Poisonous, this was really poisonous.

At least, Ling Han wouldn’t be able to sell his companions or allies like this, but Hong Tianbu did so without hesitation. It was unknown how he had deceived others in the past, deceiving even a Mystery Realm Tier elite.

It was only now that this Mystery Realm Tier was scared now that he had thought about it. That was why he called over companions that he was close to, and Ling Han just happened to encounter him.

Xiu, a figure flashed, and Jin Yulu leaped over. Her expression was filled with displeasure, “What are the two of you doing here? Aren’t you going back?” Ling Han was in no mood to continue watching, and quietly retreated. He felt a powerful pressure. If he was strong enough, so what if this was a trap? He could completely force his way in. In front of absolute strength, wouldn’t all schemes and plots be as weak as if they were made of paper?

Strength! Strength! Strength!

Ling Han quietly passed through this area. Then, he undid the Void Beast hide and stuffed the Essence Nurturing Gourd into it. It was not convenient to travel with this item wrapped around him. After all, it was not attached to his body, so if he ran too fast, he would expose himself.

He was just about to leave, when a strong sense of danger suddenly rose up in him. Without hesitation, he pushed the perverted pig backwards.

Pu!

An attack shot over, and landed on the lecherous pig. However, though the lecherous pig was weak in battle, its defense was invincible, at least under Celestial Path. No, this was not defense, but rather a kind of absorption ability, that could completely disperse all the power of the attack that was coming towards it.

However, it hurt like hell!

The perverted pig screamed in agony, tears streaming down his face. Ling Han turned his head, and saw that Hong Tianbu was standing behind him.

There was a sword in his hand, and the tip of the sword was presently piercing into the lecherous pig’s body, but it could not penetrate any further.

Hong Tianbu’s expression was filled with disbelief. He had failed to kill Ling Han with a single strike?

Shua, he delivered another strike.

Ling Han didn’t care about anything else. He activated the Imminent Skyline and instantly disappeared.

Peng, after using the Imminent Skyline for the second time, he crashed into a mountain peak, which even caused a nosebleed.

He gritted his teeth, and as he ran madly, he began to reflect on himself.

Hong Tianbu’s mind was truly meticulous. He knew that the previous trap could have been seen through by Ling Han. Thus, he had hidden himself further behind.

In this way, if the trap in front took effect, it would only be a matter of time for him to rush back. If Ling Han hadn’t fallen for it, then he should be able to rest easy now that he had reached this place. If he travelled as usual, then it should be a sure thing for him to launch a sneak attack on Ling Han.

Ling Han was filled with self-blame. He clearly knew that Hong Tianbu was a malicious person with extremely high intelligence, so how could he still be careless?

He had still underestimated Hong Tianbu. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Thankfully, he had kept a safety measure, and did not stuff the perverted pig into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Otherwise, even if that sword strike had not hit his heart, it would have still caused him serious injury.

This was the price of carelessness.

Ling Han took out some medicine and rubbed it on his nose. He reflected deeply on his actions. He definitely could not have the slightest bit of carelessness or think he might get off lucky when taking risks in such a dangerous place.

After reflecting on his errors, Ling Han continued his journey.

Previously, in his panic, he had gone astray, and when he returned to the main path, he once again used the Void Beast hide to make himself invisible. In this place, it could be said that he was surrounded by enemies, so he had to be careful.

At present, no one would care about his identity as the Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Department. They all wanted to kill him and snatch the Divine Stone.

After returning to the “right path”, Ling Han continued to climb the mountain. When night fell, he was still on the road, planning to rest during daytime. If he reversed his activities like this, his safety would be greatly increased.

Early the next morning, he stopped and began to cultivate. After that, he rested.

Yi?

The power of heaven and earth was incredibly vigorous, as if it possessed vitality. He merely drew on it lightly, and endless power surged into his body.

Was it because the heaven and earth environment had changed drastically again, or was it because this was on the Ethereal Peak? Were the power of heaven and earth here even richer?

Forget about it.

Ling Han channeled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, and together with the supplementary cultivation technique from the stone wall, stimulated the expansion of the meridians in his body.

This efficiency was too astonishing. In half an hour’s time, Ling Han’s cultivation level had improved greatly.

At this rate, there was no need for any treasured medicine at all. At most, in half a month’s time, he would be able to reach the peak stage of Four

Inscriptions.

Ling Han’s heart beat wildly. If he could maintain this kind of speed, then in a month, he would be at the peak stage of Five Inscriptions. One and a half months later, he would be at the peak stage of Six Inscriptions. If he broke through to Seven Inscriptions, then wouldn’t he truly possess the strength to stand against Mystery Realm Tier?

He was filled with anticipation. These few days, he had been hunted and targeted, and he had long since been filled with anger.

He was going to counterattack!

During daytime, he would duck into the Essence Nurturing Gourd and rest. He only had to find a hidden place to hide the gourd, and it could be claimed to be extremely safe.

At night, he came out again, and began his journey.

Yi?

He had not walked too long, when he discovered a bonfire ahead of him, surrounded by a great many people.

Hong Tianbu, Jin Yulu, and the others all sat by the bonfire.

There must be treasures here!

Ling Han thought. Otherwise, with Hong Tianbu’s pride and arrogance, how could he have possibly mingled with these people?

He approached slightly, preparing to eavesdrop on the conversation of these people.

However, these people were all spouting nonsense, and there weren’t any important points in their conversation, which made Ling Han extremely bored, just as he was about to leave, and find out for himself, these people changed the topic, and finally spoke of what he wanted to know.

As it turned out, these people had discovered an Ice Origin Stone here. The Ice Origin Stone was not a Divine Stone used to build the Celestial Foundation, but rather a treasure used to assist in cultivating. It could gather the power of heaven and earth.

The reason why the power of heaven and earth here was incredibly dense was because of the Ice Origin Stone..
