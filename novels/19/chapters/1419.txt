Chapter 1420 Rising From The Ashes, Strong Reinforcements Finally Arrives

‘what?!’

everyone’s jaw slowly dropped open. in the beginning, ling han had been severely wounded even when facing the attack of just one of the emperors, yet right now, he was completely uninjured after withstanding the combined attack of the two emperors? the elites could barely believe their eyes.

after the might of the attack swept past him, ling han’s arms immediately dropped to his side. this kind of defense drained his energy at a rate dozens of times—perhaps even 100 times—quicker than normal. with his current abilities, he could only block a maximum of three attacks from eternal river tier elites. against those at the pinnacle of the heavenly body tier, he could block 100 or so attacks with little difficulty.

the jade drop emperor and eternity sky emperor exchanged a glance. they could both see the immense astonishment in each other’s eyes.

they... definitely had to kill this young man!

the two of them attacked in unison again, fire and water combining to form a formidable attack.

ling han’s physique was incredibly powerful, and during normal times, he wouldn’t have needed to use origin power to block such attacks. however, in order to channel the indestructible heaven’s scroll to its peak strength, he had no choice but to consume his origin power.

boom! boom! boom!

he was struck again and again, forcing him to stumble back in retreat. at the same time, his origin power was also consumed at an astonishing pace.

“the brat’s about to run out of energy!”

“humph, it’s finally come to an end!”

everyone breathed a sigh of relief. they had never come across an elite at the medium extreme of the heavenly body tier who was so difficult to kill before. moreover, ling han was only pushed to his limits because of his resolve to guard the stone door. otherwise, it was very likely that he could break through their encirclement and flee.

“die!”

the two emperors had never experienced such a strong urgency to kill someone either. they launched their final attack.

ling han was facing certain death!

pa!

the attack landed, and ling han could only resist with his physique. he had already consumed all of his origin power. however, how could he block this attack with just his physique alone? moreover, he didn’t have the energy to activate tide of the ages, either. under the devastating might of the attack, his godly bones crumbled and his divine sense shattered.

‘haha, he’s as dead as can be!’ Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

the elites almost burst into rapturous applause. if ling han hadn’t had the weakness of empress luan xing, they definitely wouldn’t have been able to kill him today.

the word “lust” was topped with a “knife”[1]. their ancestors hadn’t lied to them!

boom!

ling han’s divine sense had shattered, yet there was still a spark of twinkling light. after a short moment, this spark of light suddenly burst into a ball of furious flames.

the level of this flame was far too high, and even the expressions of the two emperors changed drastically. they involuntarily stepped back in retreat. in their eyes, this ball of flames was even more terrifying than the flames of death. if they were inflicted with the flames of death, at least they would still be able to resist. however, if they came into contact with this ball of flames, they would definitely be incinerated into ashes in an instant.

these were immortal flames; these were the reincarnation flames of the immortal phoenix!

boom!

the ball of immortal flames danced in the air, no one daring to near it.

the cry of immortal phoenixes could be heard as the ball of flames rapidly grew larger. at the same time, the regulations of heaven and earth enveloped these immortal flames, allowing a complete divine sense to rapidly materialize. materializing immediately afterward was ling han’s physical body.

he walked out from the immortal flames, not a single wound on his body. moreover, he was spirited and full of energy, clearly having returned to the peak of his powers.

‘holy motherf*cker!’

everyone was stunned into silence.

‘both your body and your mind were destroyed, yet you’re still able to revive? are you still f*cking human?!’

at this moment, a sense of helplessness gripped at everyone’s heart.

regardless of how heavy his wounds, ling han had still been able to recover. now, however, he had performed something even more miraculous. his body had clearly been obliterated, and his divine sense had clearly been shattered, yet he was still able to revive and appear before them, full of energy as if nothing had ever happened. what the actual f*ck?!

was it... genuinely impossible to kill this person?

fear spread through their minds, and they couldn’t help but consider this possibility. ling han’s actions and feats had already defied all the rules of normality. thus, they wouldn’t be surprised even if someone told them that ling han was invincible and undying. moreover, ling han had not only returned to the peak of his powers after rising from the ashes, but the effects of his previous demonification had also been completely eliminated.

“heh, this old man isn’t late to the show, is he?” there was a hearty laugh as a slightly hunchbacked old man appeared before them. four heavenly bodies hovered behind him, all of them equal in size.

peak stage of the consummate level of the heavenly body tier!

however, there were still lengths of chain wrapped around the old man, causing him to appear extremely strange. looking closely, one could further tell that these chains weren’t actually real chains. rather, they were intangible chains that had been branded into his body.

xu ran!

ling han couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. “senior, you’ve finally arrived!”

xu ran chuckled upon hearing this. he had also had a mental battle with himself before finally deciding to come over. if he were at the peak of his powers, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid. however, his cultivation was sealed now, and it was fair to say that his situation was similar to that of the notionless saint. he also appeared powerful yet was actually weak in reality.

in any case, ling han finally had a powerful reinforcement by his side!

the morale of the elites from the two majestic empires had already dropped significantly. now that an elite at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier had come to reinforce ling han, they more so felt an urge to retreat.

anyhow, it was impossible to kill this brat, so what was the point of fighting against him? moreover, they had all seen the effects of the flames of death. this was a flame that couldn’t be extinguished and would combust their life force until they died. none of them wanted to die!

“there’s nothing to worry about. this person’s cultivation has been sealed, so he’s nothing more than trash!” the eternity sky emperor immediately announced. he had even become suspicious of the notionless saint, so how could he not sense the true ability of someone at the same cultivation level as himself?

“indeed,” the jade drop emperor said with a nod.

“heaven and earth are just, and even saints can’t escape the fate of death, much less you!” the eternity sky emperor pointed at ling han, and continued, “i refuse to believe that you can rise from the dead again!”

ling han wore an expression of disdain, saying, “you can try if you want.”

however, he immediately started to lament in his mind, saying, ‘wife, until when are you going to cultivate? i can’t hold on for much longer!’

“you’re definitely going to die today!” the eternity sky emperor announced in a booming voice. his voice was imbued with his willpower, and this was an announcement of his resolve.

the emperor had spoken, and this was an imperial decree!

“i beg to differ!” a cold voice suddenly said from the sky. this voice was filled with a boundless sense of domineering haughtiness.

boom!

a figure descended from the sky.

peng!

a shock wave burst into the surroundings.

pa, pa, pa, pa!

numerous heavenly body tier elites collapsed to the ground. what was more terrifying was the fact that they couldn’t crawl back up! this person possessed an overwhelming aura of dominance, one that could pressure their willpower onto the brink of collapse!

this... how could one possess such a domineering aura?

a look of disbelief spread across ling han’s face. however, he was delighted as he exclaimed, “second brother!”

this person was none other than the rain emperor!

“haha, fourth brother!” the rain emperor stood tall and proud, the aura emanating from him surprisingly at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier!

however, it was only at the early stage, not the peak stage.

this didn’t matter, however, and ling han was simply over the moon to reunite with him. “second brother, as expected! you came across a great opportunity!” back at that time, the rain emperor had suddenly vanished in the yellow spring mystery realm, and ling han had speculated that he had received the inheritance of an eternal river tier elite. however, that had merely been speculation, after all.

now that the rain emperor had finally appeared before him, it was only natural that ling han was beside himself with delight.

“haha, i indeed came across some great opportunities,” the rain emperor said with a nod. “i had already returned to the great ling empire, and i especially hurried over here after hearing their accounts.”

“i’ve troubled you, second brother,” ling han said apologetically. this wasn’t supposed to be a battle for the great ling empire, yet he had somehow ended up making it one.

“we’re brothers, so there’s no need to say such things!” the rain emperor said. he then turned to the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor, and said, “you two are trying to kill my fourth brother?”

the eternity sky emperor and jade drop emperor were both extremely pissed off. ‘what’s with your attitude? why are the people beside ling han all so arrogant? aren’t there any ordinary people beside him?’

right now, there were two elites at the consummate level of the heavenly body tier beside ling han. although ling han hadn’t reached this level himself, he had already proved that his battle prowess couldn’t be judged based on his cultivation level alone.

were they still going to battle?

of course they were!

if they missed this opportunity, could they still kill ling han in the future? moreover, there were a plethora of secret techniques on ling han that they were hell-bent on obtaining.

“you want to die? then come and battle me!” the rain emperor said in a domineering manner. he wasn’t afraid of the two emperors in the least.
