Chapter 2522: Off to defend my wife

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Prospective Partner Ceremony? Haha, are you talking about that drinking party hosted by Xuan Ying? When did it become a Prospective Partner Ceremony?”

“Oh, I heard the members of the martial academy say that this drinking party would be called a conference of cultivation, but in truth, it is a Prospective Partner Ceremony. There is a mighty figure in the martial academy that thinks that everyone should not just be focused on cultivation, and should find some time to find a partner as well.”

“That’s true. We people are too excellent. Previously, we have concentrated fully on cultivation, and did not have the idle time to be concerned about any romantic affairs. By now, ordinary women would not be worthy of our notice at all, and probably only the empresses here would be worthy of us.”

“Brother Ding, let me tell you. Even Goddess Luan Xing would be going.”

“What, Goddess Luan Xing is also going!”

“Of course. Because of her, a few extraordinary beings would also appear at the same time, such as Gu Heyi, Xiao Yingxiong, Miao Hua.”

“Hiss, these monsters?”

The sound of the “conversation” between the two transmitted continuously, allowing Ling Han to grasp it.

It could not be helped. The jade seal was a container, and whoever sent out a message through divine sense would be heard by others who had contact with the jade seal. Originally, this was meant to make it convenient for others to share ideas, and was not supposed to be used for idle conversation.

A thought flashed across Ling Han’s mind—the Empress would be attending the Prospective Partner Ceremony?

He could not believe the Empress would do such a thing even if it killed him. Even if he really had died, with how proud the Empress was, she would not deign to go, either. She was the type to have men kneel down and look up at her while she slowly made her choice.

The Empress was probably kept in the dark. Her main reason for attending this drinking party was for the sake of discussing cultivation.

Then he could only go and take a look for himself. Otherwise, what was he to do if someone snatched his wife?

......

Those two people were just talking about the drinking party when the direction of their conversation naturally turned towards the beauties of the martial academy.

Because the martial academy had existed for a number of epochs, even if there were slightly fewer female prodigies, after so many years, a great many female prodigies had also been accumulated, and there would naturally be exquisite beauties among them.

An extremely small number of them advanced to become Heavenly Venerates, but the majority had only progressed until the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier. There were some among them that were still cultivating in the martial academy, and some that were traveling all around, looking for opportunities that would allow them to break through to that cultivation level which they yearned for.

There was also a ranking of beauties in the martial academy that had listed the most beautiful women throughout the ages. In fact, there were even other time-differentiated ranking lists, with a range of 10 billion years.

Actually, it was also the same for male prodigies. Only a rare few had become Heavenly Venerates, and the majority was still stagnating on the level of Ninth Heaven.

The men also had rankings, but what was being considered was naturally not their looks, but rather strength.

For example, in the latest ranking of strength, the one at the very top was not Heavenborn, but rather Gu Heyi, Xiao Yingxiong, and the others. They were already in the Sixth Heaven.

To be accepted as students by the martial academy, they would have to be monarch tiers at least, and those that could be ranked in the upper echelons were even more likely to be Monarch Stars. In fact, they would have to be freaks with Evolution Index that reached 11 or 12.

Gu Heyi, Xiao Yingxiong, and Miao Hua were such freaks that even Heavenborn had no choice but be ranked inferior to them.

Of course, this was because they had suppression through their superior cultivation level, and in terms of a real battle of equals, it was definitely Heavenborn that was stronger, or he would not have ranked so highly on the Eternal Stone. It should be known that the names of Xiao Yingxiong and the others were not ranked on it.

…It was also possible that they could not be bothered with this kind of ranking.

Ling Han developed some understanding. All in all, the pressure on him now was very heavy. Even if there weren’t 10,000 people that desired his wife, there had to be 8,000. Furthermore, they were all the super geniuses of the martial academy.

‘Right, off to defend my wife,’ Ling Han thought as he continued to pluck the essence of various fist techniques.

A day later, he left the library, and returned to his accommodations, where he began to meld these fist techniques together.

While his ability of deduction could not be compared to Wally’s, it was definitely in the highest tier. With the time acceleration effects, boundless enlightenment rose up inside him.

However, after two days had passed in real time, he had no choice but to stop.

The drinking party was about to begin.

He changed his clothes so he would appear more alert. However, he naturally would not be showing his real appearance. He was sure that the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others would still be able to recognize him, even if it had been a million years since they parted.

He looked again and again at the mirror, and when he felt he was handsome enough, he pushed open the doors and left.

When the two people from before had conversed, Ling Han had also found out where this drinking party would be held. Thus, he headed there directly after he exited from his place.

The drinking party was hosted by a person called Xuan Ying. He was a veteran prodigy, and going by the time-different rankings of 100,000,000 years, he was someone from the last two generations, and had long since reached the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

There were not many students that did not leave after attaining Ninth Heaven. That was because the majority would follow Heavenly Venerates to battle with Hysteria outside the realm. Though they would only be minor characters, and it would be extremely dangerous, the possibility of gaining enlightenment in such extremely dangerous circumstances would also be slightly higher.

It could be said that the majority of Heavenly Venerates had broken through in the Realm Battlefield.

Actually, Xuan Ying had also gone to the Realm Battlefield before, and had now come back for a “rest.” While he was at it, he had taken heed of the idea of some powerful figure in the martial academy, and decided to host a drinking party so he could get to know these “little brothers and sisters,” and fill them in on the cruelties of the Realm Battlefield.

His abode was located midway on a peak. Though it was also in the martial academy, there really was a far distance. Even if Ling Han raced madly with all his might, he would only be able to arrive after probably two hours, at least.

Tap, tap, tap, a sound rang out from behind him.

Ling Han was surprised. Though he was not running at full speed, his speed was already overwhelming, and someone actually managed to catch up to him.

He turned his head, and saw that it was a carriage that was nearing him quickly, and it was actually being pulled by a dragon!

Dragons were the strongest of Immortal Beasts. They were incredibly powerful creatures, and it was said that they could become Celestial Kings upon birth. With merely this fact alone, what other race could compare in this world?

Hence, dragons were also extremely proud beings.

Ling Han had never seen Celestial-level dragons in the Celestial Realm before, because the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had turned the Ancestor Dragon into a precious tool, while other dragons had basically perished in the war against the invasion of the Foreign Realm. Similarly, it was the same for the Phoenix Race as well. The Ancestor Phoenix had similarly died in the hands of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

This was his first time seeing a great Celestial King Tier dragon, but it was actually playing the role of steed. This caused Ling Han some amount of surprise.

Xiu, the dragon soared past, and the carriage also passed him by. The body of the carriage was heavily covered with seals. Clearly, this was no ordinary item, either. Otherwise, how could it be able to sustain this kind of speed? It would have long since broken apart.

“Idiot, come on and chase me!” A head stuck itself out of the carriage window, yelling at Ling Han in provocation.

Originally, Ling Han would not have taken it to heart even if he had been surpassed. He would only muse ruefully how his first encounter with a great Celestial King Tier dragon would actually be like this, yet he had not expected that he would be mocked even when he was just going his own way.

The other party was a man, and he was very young. He laughed loudly, and when he said his piece, he sat back down in his carriage.

The inner space in the carriage was very lavish, with thick carpets laid out on the floor. Aside from him, there was another purple-robed young man that was sipping wine. Seeing that he had withdrawn his head, this person held the stem of the wine cup gingerly, and asked calmly, “Young Master Zhuo, is this really good?”

“What’s bad about it? A mere Third Heaven Celestial King that does not even have a means of transport, what kind of important person could he be?” this man countered. His name was Zhuo Kai, and he had a prestigious identity. His grandfather was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

Though it did have the attachment of the word “Pseudo,” so he had not advanced into the invincible cultivation level, as long as there was the slightest link to Heavenly Venerable Tier, could that not be awesome enough?

Thus, Zhuo Kai was naturally arrogant. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The purple-robed young man was just about to speak when he spluttered out all the wine in his mouth with a sudden?pu.
