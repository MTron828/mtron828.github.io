Chapter 1344 Stepping forward bravely to protect master

The formation moved, forming an evil spirit as tall as 300 meters, its malicious aura soaring sky-high.

“Destiny Sword!” Ling Kongcheng meanwhile drove the ancestral weapon to slash down at Ling Han.

Shua, in the skies, the ancestral weapon shone and became 30,000 meters long. It slashed down with a sword light, extremely brilliant and blinding.

All the members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace were smirking coldly. The ancestral weapon and the Great Protective Formation showed their might at the same time, boosting each other’s power. That might would be able to match the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier, which could practically be considered another type of the Heavenly Body Tier, which would be enough to crush any Sun Moon Tier.

This brat might be freakish, but he was too arrogant. He actually dared charge boldly into their ancestral grounds; wasn’t that practically courting his own death?

Sword light and the evil spirit attacked at the same time, exuding a frightening aura.

Ling Han’s feet moved, and he easily dodged all the attacks. He had even drawn the attacks towards where the people of the Heaven’s Sword Sect were, causing both Ling Kongcheng and Yang Jin to break out in a cold sweat.

They were the controllers of the ancestral weapon and formation, and it would naturally take a lot of their concentration and effort to control these two objects that had such powerful and frightening might.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

One attack landed after another, and a massive commotion rang out in the city, causing those mortals who did not know the truth to be greatly puzzled. What was going on with the Heaven’s Sword Palace? In their memories, the Heaven’s Sword City had never experienced being invaded by an outside force.

However, there were also more and more elites of the Heaven’s Sword Palace gathering. As long as they had reached the Sun Moon Tier, they all raced over here. Mountain River Tiers could only watch the battle from afar, whereas those below Immortal level had temporarily left the Heaven’s Sword Palace to avoid being impacted by the shock waves from the battle. That would lead to definite death.

A beautiful woman appeared, and called out anxiously to Jiang Qiaoling, “Qiao’er!”

Beside her was a handsome man. He had a little ‘badness’ in his handsomeness, yet one would still be enchanted by his charisma.

Jiang Yuefeng!

Ling Han recognized him with a single glance. This flashy disciple of his was still as dashingly handsome as he had been. That kind of charm that had a little bit of ‘badness’ in it was something that would most easily attract women.

“Father, Mother!” Jiang Qiaoling hurriedly raced over, and threw herself into the beautiful woman’s arms. The latter was a noble daughter of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, and her name was Chen Di.

Chen Di quickly embraced her daughter with deep concern as she asked, “Qiao’er, are you injured?” When she knew that her daughter was together with a bringer of misfortune like Ling Han, she almost fainted in her anxiety.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuefeng frowned. He was looking at Ling Han, his eyes confused.

This man was actually called Ling Han as well, and had come from the Lower Realm, causing a very huge wave to rise up in his heart.

“Father, this uncle says he’s your old friend, and he knows the Cold Wind Palm!” Jiang Qiaoling spoke fast, and blurted out everything in a single instant.

‘What?!’

Jiang Yuefeng was instantly stirred up. Only his master and fellow disciples knew the Cold Wind Palm, and this man was also named Ling Han and had come from the Lower Realm. These three important facts added together caused him to come up with a very bold deduction.

He took a few steps forwards, and loudly asked, “Sir, who was the one who taught you the Cold Wind Palm?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I learnt it on my own, but as for yours, I was the one who taught you.”

Jiang Yuefeng received a shock, yet he shook his head repeatedly, and said, “Impossible! Impossible! My master has passed away, don’t think that you can impersonate him!”

“Is that right?” Ling Han smiled, and casually spoke of some events that had happened when he had taken Jiang Yuefeng as disciple. Though those were all unremarkable small matters, they were also only known to only Ling Han and Jiang Yuefeng. Not even his other three disciples knew of them.

“Ma-Master!” Jiang Yuefeng instantly knelt down, tears streaming down his cheeks.

Meanwhile, Jiang Qiaoling had paled. She had indeed not guessed wrongly—this was really that Ling Han! And she actually used her father’s master like a shield, and had called him an uncle all this while. If her father found out, he would definitely beat her bottom black and blue.

“En?” Chen Jin and Ling Kongcheng were both stunned[1]. They naturally knew some information about Jiang Yuefeng. He was a prodigious disciple, after all.

However, Jiang Yuefeng had been brought to the Immortal Realm 10,000 years ago, and Ling Han had come through opening the sky only 20 years ago. How could the timing match?

Time Source Fluid!

They immediately had this thought in their hearts. This was a divine item that could seal off vitality and allow one to pass thousands of years. Unfortunately, it was only effective for those below Immortal level. However, if that was not the case, they would not be qualified to obtain this object even with their abilities.

“So he is a remaining evil element!” Chen Jin smirked coldly. “We did not find you and kill you 10,000 years ago, leaving a great danger for us at present!”

“Kill!” Ling Kongcheng’s eyes were cold as well. More and more elites were arriving and collectively controlling the ancestral weapon and formation. Not only did this take off a lot of pressure from the two of them, it also increased the might of the ancestral weapon and formation greatly.

“Evil Spirit Servile Sword!” Ling Kongcheng roared loudly. That evil spirit actually gripped the divine sword from the skies, and ruthlessly slashed down on Ling Han.

This was the perfect merging of the ancestral weapon and the Great Protective Formation, which could boost their might to the true apex.

It was so close to the apex that it was equivalent to the early stage of the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Stop!” Jiang Yuefeng stepped out bravely, not caring for how weak he was, and stood in front of Ling Han. He stretched out his arms, exhibiting the courage that said, ‘if you want to kill my master, you have to kill me first’.

“Yuefeng!” Chen Di hurriedly stepped out as well, also regardless of the danger she would face.

“Father, Mother!” Jiang Qiaoling did not hesitate as well, and jumped out too.

“Damn it!” Chen Jin roared in fury, and hurriedly pointed a finger at that evil spirit. The might of the sword slash delivered by the evil spirit was immediately forced to one side, missing Ling Han, and landed on the ground nine meters beside him, giving rise to dust and sand that filled the air. A crack appeared in the ground, spreading out in all directions like a spider’s web.

This was equivalent to the attack of a Heavenly Body Tier; its destructive ability was too powerful. Even if there was a great protective formation here, it was useless.

“Chen Di, Qiao’er, come back quickly!” Chen Di called out harshly. Though Jiang Yuefeng was also his great-great-great-grandson-in-law, since he was not of their lineage, he could be punished and killed. He was already filled with the intent to kill him.

“No!” Chen Di shook her head, and begged, “Ancestor, please don’t hurt Yuefeng!”

“Don’t harm my parents!” Jiang Qiaoling also stretched out her arms, acting aggressive and overbearing.

“Qiao’er, Chen Di, the two of you go back!” Jiang Yuefeng commanded seriously. He could not possibly stand by and watch as his master was ganged up on and killed, but he similarly was unwilling to see his wife and daughter implicated in this matter as well.

“Yuefeng!” Chen Di wept, only shaking her head continuously.

Jiang Yuefeng felt like his heart was being cut apart, yet his expression was cold. He had no regrets, even if he would die.

Without Ling Han, he would have long since died.

Yet Ling Han smiled, and said, “Yuefeng, you have gotten yourself a good spouse.”

Jiang Yuefeng smiled bitterly. Things had already reached this point, yet his master was still so composed. This ability to keep himself calm was something he admired, but it did not change the present situation in the slightest!

“Old Chen, sorry!” Ling Kongcheng humphed, and began to control the evil spirit again to slash out at Ling Han. Not only would this strike hit Ling Han, even Jiang Yuefeng and the others would not be able to escape.

In the face of the survival of the sect, what was kinship worth?

Chen Jin sighed, but closed his eyes.

Boom, the divine sword descended!
