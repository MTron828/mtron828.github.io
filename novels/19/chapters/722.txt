Chapter 723: Well Done

Translator: Henyee Editor: Henyee

“Want to fight?” Ling Han asked laughingly. He had now mastered the art of coupling toughness with gentleness where they complemented each other to create an ideal mix. He was completely fearless even if Jia Ming was a whole cultivation tier above him.

“Hmph, it’s not a fight, but my executing you!” Jia Ming retorted with a prideful air. So what if the secret techniques mastered by Ling Han were superior to his? In the end, without attaining a certain cultivation level, and without attaining the level of major accomplishment in the secret techniques, he could still totally crush Ling Han.

“Then let’s have a fight!” Ling Han naturally was not afraid to fight.

“Handsome Little Brother, what are you fighting over?” It was at this moment that a sweet and charming voice rang out. The terrifying aura struck unsuspectingly, making everyone feel as if there was a rock pressing down on their chests. It was so difficult to bear that it made one only wanted to spit out blood.

The throngs of people couldn’t help but part, and there, amidst the crowd, one could see a tall and slender yet well filled-out figure of a beautiful lady. She sat upright with her legs laid out horizontally atop the body of a huge demonic lion. The demonic lion was so imposing and fiercely powerful that it was alarming. Its entire body was covered in scales, akin to those of a dragon’s, and its presence was even more terrifying as if it could shake the stars and constellations off the skies with just a roar.

In reality, it could indeed accomplish such a feat as it was an existence of the Shattering Void Tier.

The Lunar King had arrived.

“This, This... who is this? With such overly terrifying presence... My heart is about to explode!”

“Moreover, what an astonishing beauty! Look at that bosom, it is so voluptuous that I definitely would not be able to hold it in with one hand. Wouldn’t it be great if I could just have a touch?”

Pa!

Someone had cast lustful looks upon the Lunar King, and unwittingly spoke those lewd thoughts aloud. Immediately, his whole head exploded, leaving the headless body to rock and sway a few times before falling down with a loud crash, thoroughly dead.

When the others saw this, they were all overwhelmed with shock, staring at the Lunar King with deep fear.

That was because she had stretched out her long, slender, and fair hand, her finger pointed at that person, so evidently she was the one who had killed him.

The problem here was not whether that person’s strength was strong or not, but rather the majority of the people here all possessed very powerful backgrounds. Making such an unbridled attack, aren’t you afraid that it would give cause to disaster?

Only a handful of people knew that this particular mistress was in fact at the Shattering Void Tier. There was no need for her to fear anyone in this realm! Furthermore, for him to have dared to have the audacity to utter such lecherous words to an elite of the Shattering Void Tier, shouldn’t he be killed?

Even if he was a true disciple of the Heaven’s Sword Sect or the Absolute Saber Sect, he would have definitely died in vain.

How could the Shattering Void Tier tolerate such humiliation?

The Lunar King approached riding on the demonic lion, and even Jia Ming, who was totally clueless about what it was like to be filled with respect and awe, took a few steps backward, unable to equal the Lunar King’s aura.

His future achievements were a different story, but at least at present, he totally could not compare with the Lunar King.

“I won’t allow you to have any ideas on Hu Niu’s Ling Han!” Hu Niu waved the Dragon Fang Shears as she roared at the Lunar King.

The Lunar King could not help being dazed for an instant. “You have actually obtained the Dragon Fang Shears? What rarity, wasn’t it claimed to be unattainable? Even I was not able to obtain it those years ago... Pei, if I had wanted to obtain it, how could it be possible that I would fail!”

Her beautiful eyes swept across as she remarked, “The lot of you have all used the Stone of Martial Intent, I presume? Hahahahaha, just telling you, I had once left my name inscribed on that stone tablet, the 99th place in all the history of this realm!”

Ling Han’s group were snickering secretly—at present, this master’s name had actually been already struck off from the list. The sudden emergence of three super geniuses, Ling Han, Hu Niu, and Jia Ming, all at the same time had immediately forced down the Lunar King’s name.

The Lunar King was still unaware of this, and looking upon the odd expressions on everyone’s face, asked, “You don’t believe me? Kitten, lead the way, let them have a look at my name!”

The demonic lion was already made completely submissive, truly as if it was just a kitten; it carried the Lunar King to the front of the Stone of Martial Intent.

The Lunar King, apparently filled with pride, pointed her finger at the Stone of Martial Intent and said, “At that time, only I and His Majesty made it onto the list. The other seven kings all merely managed to trigger red light, and absolutely could not compare with me— yi, where did my name go?”

She stared fixedly at the Stone of Martial Intent. Where was her name on the 99th place? Even in the 100th place, she also did not see it.

“After such a long time, this piece of lousy stone has malfunctioned?” she mumbled.

“No, it has been forced down by others already.” Ling Han opened his mouth. “At the very beginning, I did indeed see the Lunar King’s name on the 99th place.”

“What, who would dare to force down my name?” The Lunar King became indignant at once, directing her line of vision to the list as she searched upwards. Very quickly, her gaze fell upon Jia Ming’s name. Immediately, she snapped in a murderous manner. “Which fellow is named Jia Ming?”

Shua , everyone’s gazes settled unwaveringly upon Jia Ming at the same time. It was a conditioned reflex. Words from the mouth of an elite of the Shattering Void Tier would draw out one’s subconscious reactions and influence one’s will.

The expression on the Lunar King’s face instantly turned dangerous as she cracked her fingers, making popping sounds. “So you’re the guy, how dare you force down my name from the list. Tell me, should I chop you into three or five pieces?”

The color drained from Jia Ming’s face. No matter how capable he was, to challenge an elite of the Shattering Void Tier was beyond his capabilities. Furthermore, that person had also made it into the list on the Stone of Martial Intent before. And now, she had even attained the battle prowess of the Shattering Void Tier, which was deemed as nearly achieving the ultimate battle prowess that the Stone of Martial Intent predicted. How formidable was that?

Even if all the prodigies of the Earth Dragon Sect that had been sealed were to appear at the same time, even the strongest among them could not possibly match her.

In a flash, the Lunar King’s expression turned extremely dark as she questioned, “What you mean is that I am very old already?”

“Senior—”

“Senior your sister!” The Lunar King leaped down from the demonic lion’s body, and charged towards Jia Ming, beating him up fiercely. With her strength, she naturally overpowered Jia Ming and thrashed him heavily.

Ling Han was laughing inwardly. The Lunar King was exceedingly sensitive about age, and even Ma Duo Bao, an emperor, was also beaten up. He actually dared to call her senior and even especially emphasized the age gap between the two. He had really run straight into the sharp end of her spear.

Jia Ming felt very wronged, but he could not open his mouth to refute at all. He was beaten by the Lunar King till his nose was bloody and his face was swollen. He felt he has totally become a punching bag; his only fate was to be brutally abused.

Only when the Lunar King was feeling somewhat appeased after beating him did he groan earnestly as he covered his face. “Senior, not only I have made it into the list, there’s also Ling Han and that little girl!”

“Senior?” The Lunar King’s rage which had calmed down with much difficulty surged forth once again. Which part of her looked like a senior to him?

Hit again! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Peng, peng, peng , after a heavy thrashing, the Lunar King smacked her hands and felt her mind and spirit had eased. She looked towards the Stone of Martial Intent, and said, “Which places are the both of you at that you can also surpass me— f***!”

She had caught sight of Ling Han’s and Hu Niu’s names, and they were ranked at the second and the first place, respectively!

Jia Ming looked on and couldn’t stop the corners of his mouth turning into a sneer. He ranked on the 51st place and was already beaten up so badly. Since the two of them ranked first and second, could they still stay alive?

“Hahahaha, you actually made His Majesty, that egoistic maniac, drop into the third place?” The Lunar King suddenly burst into hearty laughter after staring dazedly for a while. “I am about to laugh myself to death. That fatty claimed his battle prowess was unparalleled with such extreme pomposity that he even gave himself a title of ‘first’. Unexpectedly, he has actually been forced down to the third place already. Wahahahaha, I really want to go back and get a look at the expression on that fatty’s face now. I will definitely make him lick my shoes! Well done!”
