1402 Completely Stupefied

Who was this? He dared to be so outrageously bold that he had even caused the ancestor of the Lu Clan to come out.

“Ling Han?”

“What, Ling Han’s come back?”

“Ling Han is still alive?”

When they knew that this “culprit” was Ling Han, everyone bore a strange expression. It was not new information that Ling Han was the type to cause trouble. He made an enemy of Sha Yuan and Zhao Lun, and dared to even offend two Great Generals in the Heavenly Body Tier, so it was completely nothing unusual for him to now anger the ancestor of the Lu Clan.

However, this was an excitement they definitely had to see.

The news spread like wildfire, and more and more people moved out, heading in this direction. And when the news reached the residence of the Great General Sha, an endless killing intent surged out immediately, causing the surrounding area to become extraordinarily cold.

Sha Yuan had died in Ling Han’s hands, but Great General Sha had not even managed to avenge his son when the Majestic Heaven Sect had been destroyed, and Ling Han had also disappeared. All these years, Great General Sha had thought that Ling Han was dead, but now he actually found out that Ling Han had come back alive, so it was natural that his killing intent would blaze.

Though Sha Yuan was not the most outstanding of the Great General Sha’s sons, he was not someone that could be easily killed just like that, either.

Xiu, the Great General Sha flew out. When a Heavenly Body Tier was enraged, even the formation that protected the Imperial Capital trembled greatly. The Left and Right Ministers and the remaining six Great Generals were also alerted.

Of course, because the transmission of news was slightly slower, long before the Great General Sha had moved out, the ancestor of the Lu Clan had already led his clansmen and arrived at the restaurant.

“Ling Han, you’d better come out and accept your death!” the juniors o the Lu Clan called out loudly.

At this time, Ling Han had already finished eating. He sat calmly on the upper floor, and he just happened to be clearly seen through one of the human-shaped holes. He waved a hand casually, and pa, those juniors each received a slap. They were all sent flying, all of them unconscious.

This naturally was because Ling Han had gone easy on them. Otherwise, if a Heavenly Body Tier moved, not just Mountain River Tiers would definitely not be able to survive it, even Sun Moon Tiers would be obliterated in an instant.

The ancestor of the Lu Clan was furious, and he shouted, “Ling Han, you are too bold. You actually dare to humiliate my clansmen in front of me.”

“Old man, if you continue to make noise, I’ll beat you too,” Ling Han stated calmly. Since things had reached this point, he decided to simply let go, and just let the trouble continue to its end.

The ancestor of the Lu Clan was so furious that he smiled instead. Not only had he lived to such an old age, he was also an existence in the peak stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. How many were there in the whole Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire that could beat him?

At most, there were only 20!

It couldn’t be helped. The Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire had been established for only a short time, and did not have much background. How could it be compared with the Eternity Sky and Jade Drop Majestic Empires?

“Junior, come down, I really want to teach you what it means to respect your elders—”

Pa!

The ancestor of the Lu Clan had not finished what he meant to say when his face had already severely been slapped.

“Oh, what do you want to teach me?” Ling Han asked calmly. He had not even approached, and was still sitting high up on the upper floor of the restaurant. Then, he delivered another slap. Pa, pa, pa. The ancestor of the Lu Clan had no way to resist at all, and was on the receiving end of repeated slaps.

His face had immediately turned red and swelled. His teeth flew out one after another, blood covering his whole face.

However, the physical pain was practically negligible. The ancestor of the Lu Clan had already gone blank with shock.

How could he only possibly be in the Sun Moon Tier if he could play with him as he liked like this!

His heart trembled violently, and a realization that he could not believe at all surged up in his heart. Though he was absolutely unwilling to face it, the truth itself was slapping him in the face.

A Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Ling Han was actually in the Heavenly Body Tier!

Heavens, for the sake of currying the favor of the dog of a great elite in the Heavenly Body Tier, he actually went and offended another Heavenly Body Tier. How stupid was that?

But who could have imagined that the country bumpkin that had come from opening the sky those years ago had become a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier in an instant when just these few years had passed?

No one could have possibly imagined that, and they would not dare to imagine such a possibility, either!

Not only was the ancestor of the Lu Clan completely stupefied, all the others were gaping widely, yet could not emit the slightest sound.

Heavenly Body Tier, this was definitely a Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Xiang Chengyun was about to cry. If you had f****** advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier, you should have said so. After becoming this kind of elite, he dared not even have the slightest bit of envy. Even if the Left Minister himself had arrived, he would have to treat him respectfully.

He had offended a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, so the Left Minister would definitely turn his back on him. What kind of eyes did he have? How could he possibly do the jobs that he had been assigned well with such poor insight?

“A great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier!” The beautiful eyes of the noble daughter of the Lu Clan shone brightly. This was the kind of husband that she dreamt of!

There was a dead silence. Only the sound of the continuous slaps that the ancestor of the Lu Clan was receiving could be heard, appearing very sharp to the ear. More importantly, a Sun Moon Tier was strong, especially when they were defended by Origin Power, so their skin was naturally thicker and stronger than even the city walls, so there was a very powerful impact when it was being slapped.

The well-known figures of the younger generation all arrived. There was Li Weiwei, Ji Yun’er, as well as Luo Ba, Lin You, Ma Xing, and Cheng Haofei, and Zhao Lun had arrived as well. His face was completely dark, shock and terror filling his eyes.

Ling Han had actually advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier!

Just think, at that time, he had repeatedly insulted Ling Han, and had even wanted to kill the latter. All this was because he had a father in the Heavenly Body Tier standing behind him, which caused him to do as he liked and act without any scruples.

But now?

Ling Han had become a Heavenly Body Tier, and now it was Ling Han’s turn to act without any scruples. Even if he killed him, what of it?

Could a great elite of Heavenly Body Tier be insulted? What a joke!

“Ling Han, you’ve come back?” Li Weiwei called out loudly. “You meanie, I thought you had died.”

Ling Han withdrew his hand with a smile, and said, “Long time no see.” Previously, he had cooperated with Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er for business, and they could be claimed to have had a very cheerful partnership.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden immediately gave a humph, and asked, “Which girlfriend is this of yours again? Why have I never heard you talk about her?”

Meanwhile, Chen Ruijing and the others snickered secretly on the side. They could be claimed to know the temperament of this missus of theirs very well. Her character was unyielding, and she was not prepared to turn a blind eye on anything objectionable.

“Humph!” A heavy pressure suddenly approached, causing everyone’s hearts to be filled with a powerful fear. It was as if in the time for a mere thought, this place would become a bloodbath. Not a single person would be able to remain alive.

A figure appeared, his whole body enshrouded in a chaotic aura, though it was not very dense. His appearance was still visible. He was completely dressed in military attire, had a square face, his appearance majestic, and exuded an aura of dignity and imperiousness. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Sha Jing, the Great General Sha!

Xiu, another incredibly powerful being appeared.

Zhao Jianbai, the Great General Zhao!

Quickly, a third elite appeared. He was dressed in scholarly attire, and appeared very clean-cut and quiet.

The Left Minister, Li Cheng.

Three great elites of the Heavenly Body Tier had arrived all at once. This was the strongest level of power of Joint Peace Planet. Though these three people had not reached the consummate level, since they had advanced into this cultivation tier, they had the qualification of being a small world by themselves.

The Left Minister looked at Ling Han. His initially unruffled, assured expression immediately disappeared completely.

Ling Han, it was actually Ling Han!

This guy had actually advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier, and had done it so quickly at that!

He knew that Ling Han’s natural talent in cultivation was astonishing, but he had thought that even if Ling Han’s fortune was nature-defying, he would need at least one to two million years to be able to step into this cultivation level, and there were too many things that could happen in these one to two million years. Ling Han himself was also an extreme and troublemaking character as well. Thus, the Left Minister had been unwilling to allow his beloved daughter be too close to Ling Han.

Yet he had never imagined this!

The Left Minister felt his face flushing hotly as if he had just been slapped harshly.

What poor vision had he had!
