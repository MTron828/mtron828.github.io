Chapter 1437 Rank Three King Tier!

In the Immortal Realm, heaven and earth were great. However, Saints were the greatest.

Few Saints would give face to others. However, perhaps even fewer people could give face to Saints.

Thus, Ling Han quietly bragged to himself in his mind. However, this was all he could do. If he were more powerful, he could have done as he pleased. He could have killed Liu Juntian without giving face to the Dīpankara Saint or fearing him.

‘Power, power, power... In the end, everything revolves around power...’

The spectating king tiers were all speechless with shock. Although Liu Juntian wasn’t the highest-ranked among them, he was the only rank two king tier present. This meant that he was the most powerful among those at his cultivation level. Yet, before Ling Han, he had almost been defeated in the blink of an eye. With this comparison, it was evident just how terrifying Ling Han was.

This king tier was far too freakish!

Liu Juntian crawled up, his expression dejected and traumatized.

He had always known that the Dīpankara Saint had left a wisp of his aura inside his body. This aura would save his life if he ever came across any fatal danger. However, this was both a protection and a test. He had once been brimming with confidence, certain that the wisp of aura would still be with him when he entered the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy.

Now, however, his confidence had been brutally shattered.

The wisp of aura had disappeared, and he had undoubtedly disappointed the Dīpankara Saint. This also signified that he had already “died” once.

“The martial arts academy competition in 20 years... I’ll return to defeat you!” After saying this, Liu Juntian descended the mountain, not glancing back even once.

He was a person of great fortune, and he had once obtained an incredible cultivation technique. However, practicing this cultivation technique was full of dangers. In fact, even a king tier such as him would face the risk of death. Thus, he had never practiced this cultivation technique before, planning to only begin after he entered the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy and had the supervision of the Star Sand Saint.

Now, however, he had decided to immediately enter seclusion and cultivate. He would master this cultivation technique in 20 years, thereby giving him the power to wash away today’s humiliation.

He, Liu Juntian, was a king among kings!

Ling Han shook his head. In terms of battle prowess among those at the same cultivation level, Liu Juntian was no more powerful than the Stone Emperor or North Emperor. Meanwhile, Chi Huangji was perhaps even a tad more powerful than him. Being as vast as the universe was, there was absolutely no shortage of prodigies.

There was a flash, and Empress Luan Xing had already stepped forward. She raised her hand and rapidly pointed at a few people. “You, you, you...” After pointing at all the people, she said, “It’s time to eat stones.”

They genuinely had to eat stone?!

The king tiers singled out by Empress Luan Xing all wore awkward expressions on their faces. They had indeed said that they would eat stones if Ling Han won. However, who would have thought that he would actually win?

If they ate a stone before the others, what face would they still have?

All of them remained silent and unmoving. Anyhow, there were so many of them, so what could Empress Luan Xing do if they resisted? Would she dare to challenge all of them at once?

Killing intent started to ooze from Empress Luan Xing. She was an incredibly proud individual, and she had also been an empress for 1,000,000 years. Her decree was the decree of heaven. So, who dared to oppose her?

She wouldn’t mind going on a killing spree.

A man in green flew over, and said, “Heh, this celestial maiden, why don’t we make a bet.”

There were three streaks of white-veined patterns on his forehead. However, these veined patterns didn’t affect his appearance, instead making him appear even more profound. He was a beautiful man, an incredibly handsome man.

“Why don’t we have a sparring match. If you win, I’ll force these people to obediently eat dirt!” he said with confidence and haughtiness.

The 10 or so king tiers who had lost their gamble with Empress Luan Xing were all enraged. If they teamed up, who in the Heavenly Body Tier could block them? Yet, this person dared to say that he would force them to obediently eat dirt? Where was his courage coming from?

“I’m Zhu Yue,” the man said. There was adoration in his eyes as he gazed at Empress Luan Xing. This was a woman who could capture one’s soul without even needing to reveal her true appearance. Thus, he couldn’t help but feel love and adoration for her.

A smile appeared on his face, and he continued, “If I win, however... why doesn’t this celestial maiden show me her true appearance? What do you say?”

Empress Luan Xing was infuriated upon hearing this. The projection of a large snake slowly materialized behind her, a single horn on its head even though it was clearly a snake. Like a True Dragon, its body was coiled, an astonishing might radiating from its body. “If you lose, you can eat stones alongside them!” Empress Luan Xing said in a menacing voice.

Zhu Yue laughed heartily, and replied, “Deal!” With a single thought, several heavenly bodies instantly materialized behind his body. Counting carefully, it was clear that there were a whopping four heavenly bodies, each of them covered with ancient words that continuously flowed over their surface. However, it was seemingly impossible to identify what these ancient words said.

Consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I reached the pinnacle level in both the Mountain River Tier and the Sun Moon Tier,” Zhu Yue said proudly. “Now, I’ve reached the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Who’s powerful enough to oppose me?”

His words sent a wave of commotion through the king tiers.

‘What? A third rank two king tier has appeared?’

There were only 30 or so king tiers present! Since when had rank two king tiers become so commonplace?

However, it was no wonder that Zhu Yue was so haughty. He was a rank two king tier on top of being at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier! Who at the Heavenly Body Tier could be his opponent? Only rank three king tiers would be able to surpass him. However, was this possible? Even among Saints, only a rare few individuals had been prodigious enough to become rank three king tiers.

According to rumors, the Star Sand Saint was one such supreme king tier. Meanwhile, his nine disciples were all rank two king tiers.

Thus, those who entered the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy would at least need to be rank one king tiers. If one wanted to become the personal disciple of the Star Sand Saint, they would at least need to be a rank two king tier. However, the Star Sand Saint was going to pass on his inheritance this time, so the requirement for his disciple would only be higher. Perhaps one would need to be a rank three king tier to have any chance.

This requirement was incredibly high. There were only four major tiers from the Mountain River Tier to the Eternal River Tier, yet one would need to have reached the pinnacle level in three of these major tiers. Such a requirement was insane enough to have the majority of king tiers shake their heads and sigh.

Meanwhile, Zhu Yue couldn’t help but feel haughty. Originally, he wasn’t one to show off and act arrogantly. However, the appearance of Empress Luan Xing had caused him to change his mind. Like a peacock displaying its feathers, he was eager to display his talents to capture the heart of the beauty.

‘How is it? Do you understand the might and power of this brother now? Hurry, show me your adoring and worshipping gaze.’

Boom!

Empress Luan Xing lashed out, the universe seemingly collapsing as her palm pressed down.

Zhu Yue’s expression changed drastically. The might of this palm was far too terrifying. In fact, even the flow of his blood was stopped, a cold chill shooting through his body. The terror that befell him was as if he were lurking near hell’s gates.

He made a symbolic attempt to block. However, the unstoppable power of Empress Luan Xing surged over, immediately blasting him backward. He was like a grasshopper trying to stop a carriage—useless and hopelessly overpowered.

Peng!

His body arced through the air before heavily crashing into the ground with a beautiful pose.

‘This...!’

Silence instantly fell over the king tiers. The only sound remaining was that of heavy breathing.

‘Zhu Yue is a rank two king tier! Moreover, he’s also at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier! How was he sent flying by a single slap?

‘This woman... She’s at the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier!’

What did it matter if one had reached the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier and Mountain River Tier? If they came across someone who had reached the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, their fate could only be described in one word—defeat. This would be the case even if the latter person hadn’t reached the pinnacle level in the previous two tiers. Of course, this was unless both of them had reached the Eternal River Tier. At that stage, the person who had reached two pinnacle levels would definitely be more powerful than the person who had only reached one.

The higher one’s cultivation, the more difficult it would be to reach the pinnacle level. As such, most king tiers would only reach the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. It was also because of this that rank two king tiers were incredibly rare, and rank three king tiers... Well, throughout the hundreds of neighboring galaxies, only the Star Sand Saint had successfully become a rank three king tier.

Gasp!

She had even reached the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, so it was extremely likely that this woman had also reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier and the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Rank three king tier!
