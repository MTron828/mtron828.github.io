Chapter 1980: Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood

This bolt of lightning had descended far too suddenly. Moreover, its might was overwhelming, and just its aura alone was enough to chill one to the core.

At the very least, Ling Han was certain that he would have been killed if he had been struck by this lightning.

“This is heavenly tribulation!” Ling Han exclaimed.

Even though this bolt of lightning had descended from above them, it had eerily avoided them in a mysterious manner.

There could only be a single reason.

This was heavenly tribulation, and it would only target a certain individual. Thus, as long as others didn’t interfere, it wouldn’t attack them regardless of how close they were to the target. Of course, if heavenly tribulation sent shards of rocks flying everywhere, the heavens naturally wouldn’t take responsibility for those who were wounded by these rocks.

However, none of them had ascended to the next level, so why was heavenly tribulation suddenly descending? Moreover, it was such a devastating heavenly tribulation.

“Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood!” they exclaimed in unison.

Only this wondrous matter would attract tribulation after tribulation. If it weren’t being blazed by flames, it would be suffering the wrath of lightning. Thus, this sudden and unexpected heavenly tribulation could only point to a single thing. It was almost certain that the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood had been struck by lightning again. Just then, they had only witnessed a sliver of the shock wave.

“If that’s the case...”

They looked up, only to see a vast expanse of clouds and mists.

Ling Han took a deep breath and gathered all of his strength. He then drew his Divine Demon Sword, and unleashed a slash at the sky.

Boom!

A burst of sword light arced through the sky, brimming with a tumultuous and murderous aura.

The clouds and mists were violently ripped apart, revealing an expanse of clear blue sky. As if they possessed life, however, the clouds and mists started to rapidly squirm and fuse, causing the sky to become gray and hazy again.

However, that short instant was already enough for Ling Han and the others to see clearly.

There was an indescribably colossal tree in the sky, and they were currently standing under the crown of this tree.

No wonder an arc of lightning had crashed down. As it turned out, they were standing right under the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood.

This was truly a case of looking for light under a lamp’s shadow—they had been searching for the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood right under its shade.

“Judging by the shape of the tree’s crown, the main trunk should be over there...” Ling Han said as he pointed in a certain direction.

“Mm-hm, let’s go.”

The four of them set off in that direction. Surprisingly, it took them seven entire days to finally arrive before a pitch-black wall.

Standing before this wall, one would realize that this wall wasn’t entirely straight. Instead, there was a slight curve to it. More precisely, this was a circular wall. However, it was far too large, so from close up, it looked much like a flat wall.

This was the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood!

When they finally discovered that they were standing under the crown of the tree, perhaps they had already been traveling under it for several days. Yet, they had still needed to spend another seven days to finally reach the base of its trunk. This was a direct reflection of the colossal nature of this tree.

With the trunk of the tree being so colossal, could the crown of the tree be small?

Ling Han reached over to place his hand on the tree trunk.

Crackle...

An arc of white lightning immediately shot over.

Peng!

Ling Han was sent flying back.

Hu Niu hurriedly ran over, and asked, “Ling Han, are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Ling Han replied as he picked himself up. Even though he said this, his entire body was still trembling. The arcs of lightning on this Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood couldn’t be underestimated. Even though they weren’t powerful enough to kill him, they could still cause him to tremble uncontrollably, and make him feel extremely uncomfortable.

“Come, everyone give it a try. Let’s see who can obtain this Source Power of heaven and earth,” Ling Han said.

Ling Han wanted to obtain this Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood, yet he definitely wouldn’t be greedy about it. He would give others a chance to try their luck.

In any case, Source Powers of heaven and earth could only be obtained by those fated to it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Empress and the others all nodded in reply. They distanced themselves from each other before facing the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood.

Regarding how to obtain this treasure, this was completely up to each individual. Moreover, this was an extremely rare opportunity. After all, who knew when this Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood might soar through the sky and tunnel through the earth to leave?

Ling Han also walked over, channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll as he did so. Since this was a Heavenly Venerable Tier cultivation technique, one which was transcendent above all dao, it would theoretically be very attractive to Source Powers of heaven and earth.

Weng!

All four of them lit up with a brilliant glow. Symbols of the great dao started to materialize on their bodies, yearning to achieve resonance with the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood so that they could receive its acknowledgment.

However, the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood remained completely unresponsive. It was much like an ordinary tree, to which any expression and effort from them would be futile.

However, Ling Han and the others didn’t give up. As long as the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood remained here, they would still have a chance.

In any case, how could a Source Power of heaven and earth be so easy to obtain?

They continued to try. Several days passed, and a dense pattern of veins surprisingly started to glow on the tree.

‘There’s a reaction!’

Ling Han and the others were delighted. They started to hurriedly pour more effort into their attempts.

Xiu!

A streak of light suddenly slashed over from behind them.

Ling Han humphed before jumping up and replying with a fist.

Peng!

The streak of light instantly shattered into pieces. However, the veined patterns on the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood also stopped glowing. At the same time, the tree and earth also shuddered slightly, and it was as if the tree were about to uproot itself and fly away.

Ling Han was infuriated upon seeing this. He looked over, only to see six people standing there.

It was Shu Yarong and the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

They were truly like evil spirits that followed him around. Moreover, Ling Han’s efforts had also been rendered futile by them. Not only that, but the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood had even shown signs of fleeing.

Ling Han wasn’t opposed to competition. However, he sorely detested this kind of toxic competition.

Not long ago, he had already killed Ma Lugang in a fit of rage. Now, these people were directly trampling on his bottom line.

“You’re seeking death!”

Ling Han charged over in rage. Since they dared to interfere, they were naturally prepared to accept his wrath.

Boom!

Wings of flames unfurled behind Ling Han, and with a flap, he already arrived before Shu Yarong and the others. He drew his Divine Demon Sword, and immediately unleashed the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords.

Whoosh!

Bursts of sword light blazed into the surroundings.

Shu Yarong humphed as she replied with a palm strike.

The others also unleashed their attacks. With Shu Yarong keeping Ling Han occupied, they could wantonly attack to their heart’s content.

“So that’s how you want it?” Ling Han said with a cold chuckle. He activated his fire-element Divine Fetus, immediately summoning a column of light from the sky. This column of light enveloped him, and it was impossible to describe the might that was radiating from this light.

“Damn it! Hurry up and retreat!” Shu Yarong yelled in a frantic voice. She immediately shot back in retreat.

“Can you truly flee?” Ling Han asked in a cold voice. He unleashed the full power of his Divine Fetus.

Boom!

With him as the center, a wave of flames swept into the surroundings. Like a roaring fire dragon, these flames instantly caught up to Shu Yarong and the others.

This was the most powerful attack of his Divine Fetus. Even though Ling Han could only unleash one such attack in a short period of time, the might of this attack was truly astonishing.

The wave of flames gradually died down, revealing Ling Han’s figure. His hands were clasped behind his back, and only a single person remained standing before him.

It was naturally Shu Yarong.

However, she was also in a sorry state, and much of her clothing was already destroyed and in tatters, revealing much of her snow-white skin. In fact, one could even see glimpses of her behind, waist, and chest. However, numerous symbols flashed across her skin, and these symbols covered her body as if they were clothes.

She was panting in exertion, and a lot of her silky black hair had already been singed. She no longer wore an expression of nobility and calm, and she instead appeared as disheveled as could be.

As for the other five prodigies... They had all been exterminated!

Shu Yarong threw her head back and roared at the sky. Her beautiful face was filled with wild rage. The Wide Prosperity Heaven had initially been brimming with prodigies. However, many of them had been engulfed by Ji Wuming, and now more of them had been killed by Ling Han. Almost all of them were now dead. This caused her to feel wild with rage.

This was a calamity for the Wide Prosperity Heaven, and it would definitely take them countless years to recover this vitality.

“Naive junior, you’re actually showing such wanton disregard for the bigger picture!” Shu Yarong said in a baleful voice. In her eyes, everything was for the sake of fighting against the storm of darkness. Thus, none of the top-notch prodigies could die. In fact, it would be best if they could all grow to become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

By slaughtering these prodigies, Ling Han was essentially slaughtering the future of the Celestial Realm. This caused Shu Yarong to boil with killing intent.
