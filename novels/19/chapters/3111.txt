3112 Apologize

“Even if you can’t find a partner, there’s no need to find a maid, right? Aren’t you ashamed to bring her to such an occasion?” the young man continued mockingly.

His female companion also said, “Ugly ducklings are ugly ducklings, after all. They can’t change even if they wear the clothes of a princess.”

“Hahaha.” This wasn’t the main hall of the banquet, but because it was the peak period of the banquet, there were still quite a few people around. When they heard this, they all burst into laughter.

However, because they did not know Ling Han’s identity and background, everyone only smiled and watched the show. No one wanted to stand out. Who knew if Ling Han was pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger?

Huan Xue’s strength had increased, but her mentality was far from being able to keep up with her boost in strength. Faced with such ridicule, her first reaction was that she had embarrassed Ling Han, causing her to lower her head in discomfort. Her feet could not help but retreat, as if as long as she could distance herself from Ling Han, she could draw a clear line between the two of them.

“Apologize!” However, right at this moment, she heard Ling Han’s shout, and her heart trembled.

“You want me to apologize?” The young man pointed at himself, and couldn’t help but laugh. “Who do you think you are? Don’t you know respect for seniority?”

He had never seen Ling Han before, so there was only one possibility. Ling Han should be a new disciple.

Then, according to the rules of the Ancient Dao Sect, the first to enter the sect was considered the elder disciple, and the strong were to be respected. Why would he need to care about Ling Han’s anger?

Moreover, he also wanted to show off in front of his female companion. She was a young lady from a wealthy family in the town. Her family was in the food business. Although she wasn’t a cultivator, she was very rich. Marrying her would be of great help to him in the future.

Ling Han looked at him, and his gaze was very cold. “I’ll say it again. Apologize!”

“Haha, let alone once, so what if you repeat it 10,000 times? Do you know who I am, Junior, Brother!” He stretched out his hand, wanting to poke Ling Han in the chest.

Ling Han reached out, grabbed the other’s five fingers, and then twisted them.

“Ah…” The young man immediately let out a blood-curdling scream. As the saying went, the fingers were connected to the heart, and the pain immediately went straight to his heart.

Huan Xue saw this, and couldn’t help but tear up again. She was extremely touched.

“Young Master!” she said softly, wanting to call out to Ling Han. She was afraid that Ling Han would be at a disadvantage.

Ling Han turned his head and smiled at her. Naturally, he would not let it go. How could someone as protective as him watch the people around him just suffer quietly?

“What are you doing? Hurry up and let go!” the young man’s female companion hurriedly said. Who would have thought that Ling Han would suddenly make a move?

It had to be known that this was not only the Ancient Dao Sect, but also He Miaoyin’s birthday banquet. If they caused trouble here, wouldn’t they offend the He family?

Ling Han looked towards her, and said, “Apologize!”

‘Wh-what?’

The woman couldn’t help but retreat. Although Ling Han’s expression wasn’t terrifying at all, that cold and emotionless look made her feel a chill rise from the bottom of her heart.

Pa!

Ling Han slapped her across the face. A streak of blood flew, and the woman was already sent flying by his slap. Her hair was completely messed up, and there was a clear palm print on her left cheek. There was blood at the corner of her mouth.

Everyone drew a sharp intake of breath. This lord was truly overbearing. The other party had only mocked him a little, and he already slapped her.

‘Don’t you know that this is He Miaoyin’s house? Don’t you know that today is He Miaoyin’s birthday?’

“Apologize!” Ling Han continued, his voice cold and emotionless.

The woman was about to go crazy. She had suffered such a slap, yet she still had to apologize?

Ling Han tugged at the young man. “Ah!” As the young man cried out in pain, he moved closer to the woman and slapped her again.

Pa, the slap rang out crisp and loud.

“Apologize!” Ling Han said again.

“I-I’m sorry!” The woman admitted defeat and cried.

“Not to me, but to her.” Ling Han pointed at Huan Xue.

The woman’s mouth was half-open, and her face was filled with unwillingness. He wanted her to apologize to a servant?

Then how would she be able to hold her head up again in the future?

Pa, the third slap was delivered.

The woman finally understood that she had met a god of calamity who did not know what it meant to have tender feelings for the fairer sex.

“I’m sorry,” she said to Huan Xue.

Only then did Ling Han stop staring at her, and picked up the young man in his hands. Pa, pa, pa, he first slapped him three times, and then said, “Apologize.”

That young man’s face was filled with resentment. After being humiliated by Ling Han like this, he had completely lost his dignity. In the future, could he still hold his head high?

Pa! Pa! Pa!

Ling Han didn’t care. If the man wouldn’t apologize, fine, he would slap him until he did.

Ling Han’s refusal to talk reason finally made the young man feel fear. He had a feeling that he would be beaten to death.

He was depressed. No matter what, he was still a Two Meridians cultivator, but because he had underestimated Ling Han too much, he had actually been taken down before he could even make a single move. This made him unwilling and dissatisfied.

“I’m sorry!” He gritted his teeth.

Pa, Ling Han slapped him again, causing the young man’s mouth to half-open. He felt as if his heart was filled with ***.

‘Didn’t I f*cking apologize?’

“You dragged on for too long, so I need to add some interest,” Ling Han said calmly.

‘F*ck, there was such a thing?’

The onlookers all thought to themselves that if their strength was inferior to this person’s, they absolutely could not become enemies with Ling Han. Otherwise, they would be in dire straits. This guy was truly overbearing.

But on the other hand, wasn’t it the couple who had asked for it?

Did Ling Han offend them?

Ling Han shook his right hand, and the young man was thrown out, landing heavily on the ground.

The young man got up. He was still a gentleman, so he first checked on his female companion, and asked, “Xiaomei, are you alright?”

“Alright?” The woman pointed at her face. “You call this alright? Zhang Baichuan, are you still a man?”

Of course, the young man was Zhang Baichuan. His face was ferocious as he gritted his teeth, and said, “Xiaomei, don’t worry. I’ll definitely avenge you!”

He turned to face Ling Han, and said balefully, “I want to duel with you!”

Gasp!

Gasps rang out all around them.

In the sect, everyone would naturally spar with each other to increase their actual combat experience. However, when they were sparring, no one would be ruthless. If they injured or even killed someone, they would definitely have to pay compensation.

However, a duel was different. One was responsible for his own life or death.

From the moment he opened his mouth, Zhang Baichuan declared his intentions of a duel. It was obvious that he was too angry.

Ling Han glanced at him, shook his head, and strode off.

“You don’t dare?” Zhang Baichuan roared.

“You’re not worthy,” Ling Han said calmly.

“You!!” Zhang Baichuan was infuriated. He chased after Ling Han with a quick step, and aimed a punch at the back of Ling Han’s head.

Ling Han didn’t make a move. In fact, his steps didn’t change in the slightest.

Zhang Baichuan couldn’t help but smile. ‘You’re so arrogant. Do you really think I won’t dare to make a move?’ Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was about to land a solid punch, a fair and tender fist suddenly swung over to meet his fist.

Boom! He was instantly knocked back, and he felt his blood boil.

Zhang Baichuan focused his gaze, and couldn’t help but stare. He saw that behind Ling Han, there was a young girl maintaining her posture of having delivered a punch.

It was Huan Xue.
