2717 River of blood

Weng! A spiritual attack was shooting towards Ling Han.

He was unafraid. His body was like Divine Metal; spiritual attacks no longer had any effect on him.

Pu! With the strike of his sword, one of the tentacles of the octopus monster was immediately severed, as if it was made of tofu.

It was so easy for him because he held a Heavenly Venerate Tool, but no one else had had such a great stroke of luck to have been able to forge a Heavenly Venerate Tool when they were in the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier or even Ninth Heaven.

Peng, peng, peng! Countless blows landed on the octopus’s tentacles, yet it only caused the octopus monster’s skin to sink slightly, and did not cause any open wounds.

Of course, there were also some that were very strong, and delivered forceful strikes with various Celestial Tools, which also caused the octopus monster to bleed.

This was only a monster, yet was capable of matching at least a dozen Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. This battle prowess was truly astonishing.

The octopus monster became ferocious, several hundred of its tentacles waving around at the same time. Peng, peng, peng! Immediately, this caused massive damage. There were buildings that were instantly destroyed, and there were also some people that were whipped flying. If they were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, all the bones in their body would be directly shattered from the force.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and retreated immediately. With the Empress and the Rain Emperor present, he had lingering worries. After all, the two of them were only peak-stage Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings. It was too dangerous. He could not charge too far away from them.

Thus, he decided to just play bodyguard for the two of them, but he would not interfere immediately when the two of them encountered danger. Instead, he would only interfere secretly when they were at risk of instant death. Furthermore, this was not complete resolution of the danger, but rather turning their deadly situation into only a dangerous one.

Only then would it be effective training.

Under the combined force of several dozen Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, this octopus monster was soon dealt with, but there were more such monsters inside the city. There were mushroom clouds rising all around them.

“Attention, the Hothead Ox Monster is here!”

Right after this was announced, peng, a large bang rang out suddenly from the city wall. It was like some colossal creature had heavily crashed into the wall.

Fortunately, this city wall was sturdy enough, and had not been blasted through.

“Be careful, here it is again!”

Peng! Another large bang resounded. Not only was the city wall moaning, even the ground was trembling.

What the heck was this?

After more than 100 times, a massive hole was actually created in the city wall with a boom behind Ling Han, and he saw a gigantic black ox charge into the wall. Slightly less than half its body already went through.

But after this collision, the large black ox was also knocked unconscious. It was as if it was already dead.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ling Han delivered a stab with his sword. Pu! The tip of the sword sank into the large black ox’s forehead, going in all the way until the sword hilt. Heavenly-Venerable-Tier destructive power penetrated through, and this large black ox immediately died for good.

However, when Ling Han pulled out the sword, he saw that the large black ox actually started moving.

Could it be that it had risen from the dead?

The large black ox’s body was whipped out in a flash, and a massive foot that was covered in white fur appeared in the hole that had been created.

Ling Han came closer, and saw that this was a colossal snowman. It grabbed the large black ox with a hand, holding it like a toy1.

And behind this snowman, there was a troop of tightly packed monsters as far as the eye could see, and they were charging over. Though waves of light were being shot from the city wall, killing the majority of these monsters, the follow-up troops were relentless, as if there was no end to them.

“Zhi!” Three small monsters appeared above the wall. They looked like macaques, and stretched out tiny claws. They were only about three feet tall as well, and their blood-red eyes focused on Ling Han.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! They quickly pounced, their speed impressive.

Ling Han shook his head, and told the Empress and the Rain Emperor to step forwards. These were just three little Ninth Heaven monsters, and there was no need for him to fight personally.

Battle, battle, battle. There would be people wounded continuously and endless people collapsing. Blood spread all over the ground. Most came from Hysteria’s troops, their blood being black, but there was also a portion that came from the defenders.

Fortunately, this wave of battle only lasted three days, and no large-scale troops appeared after that. The limited number of soldiers that had slipped through the net began to retreat.

Everyone pursued them for a while before retreating into the city.

After a major battle, there was a need to make proper adjustments.

Furthermore, this battle had only persisted for three days. According to experience, this could only be considered as a part of foreplay. The upcoming battles would be even crueler. Thus, no one dared to take a risk and penetrate the front line deeply, as no one wanted to die so easily like this.

The Empress and the Rain Emperor had both sustained considerable injury, and this was also because Ling Han had not completely resolved the danger for them. However, traversing the border between life and death like this, both of them could vaguely feel that they could just touch the doors to the Ninth Heaven.

After the great battle, what was the most important was naturally repairs and recovery.

Because the city wall was key to the defense against the invading troops, the damaged places would have to be repaired at the first opportunity. Otherwise, should Hysteria’s troops attack again, the damage caused would really be too great, and they could only surrender this barrier by then, and retreat to the next one.

The repair works had only been completed for five days, and Hysteria’s troops had already launched their second wave of attack.

Ling Han still did the same as before, mainly focusing on training the Rain Emperor and the Empress. Aside from that, he would only interfere when any monsters threatened the city’s defense.

However, this assault still lasted only three days.

“It is only three days again. These are all minor skirmishes.”

“But the more it is like this, the more frightening the final storm that is brewing will be.”

“I hope the great storm will come sooner, or who knows how much more terrifying damage will be caused.”

Everyone was frowning. Previously, it had happened that there had been a series of 11 small assaults, and the giant assault that had brewed over that time had caused the deaths of several hundred Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, as well as countless Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Hopefully, the great assault that would detonate this time would not be as terrifying as that. That was several hundred Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates; just how many true Heavenly Venerates would they have been able to become in future?

This was a great loss to the Genesis World, but for Hysteria, it was only an expense of a bit of time.

The minor assaults were still continuing, one wave after another, but the great offensive that everyone was anticipating and fearing did not appear, causing their nerves to become more and more on edge.

Ling Han had no time to bother about these things. Under this kind of pressure of life and death, the doors to the Ninth Heaven were about to open for the Empress and Rain Emperor.

Perhaps it would be this time, or it might be the next.

However, after nine small waves of attacks, the final great assault was imminent at last.

A colossal troop of monsters assaulted. Though the strongest was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, the advantage in numbers was extremely obvious. A great number of monsters charged past the city wall, and an intense melee unfolded.

This battle created a river of blood, and lasted for a whole month. In fact, there were a great many Heavenly Venerates that rushed in to join the battle ranks as reinforcements. Though their battle prowess would be restricted, they were still considerably stronger than the average Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Furthermore, even if they could unleash power on the level of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, it was still good to have an additional soldier, wasn’t it?

Fortunately, they ultimately managed to defend the barrier, and stabilized this line of defense, even if it came at the price of a great many elites dying.

For Ling Han, the greater piece of good news was that both the Rain Emperor and the Empress could break through now! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They made some slight preparations, and then both of them broke through, advancing to the Ninth Heaven, both of them now standing at the pinnacle of the Celestial Path.

At this time, this was a rare time of relaxation for the city. Going by the usual pattern, there would be a number of years of peace after a great battle. After all, Hysteria also needed time to accumulate its troops.

Thus, banquets would be held one after another. A considerable number of prodigies would be invited in turn, and they could use this opportunity to converse and socialize, improving the relations among them.

Ling Han also received an invitation, but the person who had issued the invitation was Lou Tianqian.
