Chapter 2483: Who’s the Clown?

“Please wait, Friend Buddhist Cloud!” a Celestial King suddenly exclaimed, blocking his path.

He was a middle-aged man who had an innocent and handsome expression. There was a single ribbon of iridescent light around him, signifying that he was a First Heaven Celestial King.

A First Heaven Celestial King dared to block a Third Heaven Celestial King?

The Buddhist Cloud Celestial King faltered for a moment before saying, “Perhaps you recognize this brat, so you’re stepping forward to speak for him?” He was only willing to stop because this Celestial King belonged to his force. Even though he was only at the First Heaven, he still had to give him some face.

The First Heaven Celestial King smiled, and said, “Of course not. However, he’s only a First Heaven Celestial King, so I feel like there’s no need for Friend Buddhist Cloud to personally deal with him.”

These words fed the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King’s ego, and made him feel extremely satisfied. His chubby cheeks shook as he laughed loudly, and he said, “Alright, then retrieve this brat’s head as a present for Friend Dark Frost!”

“Gladly!” the Celestial King said with a slight bow. Before a Third Heaven Celestial King, he still had to maintain a certain level of respect.

The Dark Frost Celestial King saw all of this, yet he showed no signs of stepping forward to interfere. In fact, he was eagerly waiting for the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King to be humiliated. That way, he would be forced to stand on his side.

The Ninth Descent Celestial King also smiled faintly, yet he also didn’t step forward to stop the conflict. He was curious to find out just how powerful Ling Han had become.

The First Heaven Celestial King stepped forward, a cold and baleful expression in his eyes as he gazed at Ling Han.

He was called Liu Xi, and he had originally come from the Celestial Realm. He was only a king tier, and he had come to the Celestial Path in search of a rare opportunity. The first few times he had come, he had adventured in the outskirts of the Celestial Path, leaving before the 10,000-year limit expired. The final time he had come; however, he had recklessly adventured deeper, following others across the sea. Nonetheless, even though he succeeded in crossing the sea, he failed to become a Celestial King within 10,000 years. Thus, he was unable to teleport away.

He was trapped here, yet the heavens suddenly shone favor on him, allowing him to find and ingest a Celestial medicine that greatly improved his cultivation aptitude. After several billion years of difficult cultivation, he finally broke through to the Celestial King Tier.

Thus, Liu Xi greatly detested prodigies. In any case, he couldn’t leave this place anymore, so he decided to specifically target outsiders in order to soothe his disappointed heart.

......

Ling Han shook his head, looking back and asking, “Who wants to battle him?” First Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t elicit his desire to do battle.

The Rain Emperor, Ji Wuming, Hu Niu, and the others all shook their heads. They couldn’t be bothered fighting a First Heaven Celestial King. There was no fun and challenge at all.

Ling Han involuntarily sighed. Since no one volunteered, he had no option but to step forward himself. After all, who told him to jump out first?

However, Liu Xi didn’t understand this dynamic, and he thought that these people were afraid of him. He couldn’t help but roar with laughter. He leaped forward, summoning the Great Dao of Fire and transforming it into a blade that slashed down at Ling Han.

“A measly new Celestial King dares to act so wantonly? Let me teach you some discipline!”

He dashed forward, and he was truly very nimble. He instantly arrived before Ling Han.

Ling Han raised his hand, completely ignoring the flaming blade. His hand pierced through the flames and directly latched onto Liu Xi’s chest, slamming him to the ground.

Peng!

Liu Xi was instantly smashed into the ground, with stars spinning before his eyes.

He faltered for a brief moment, and when he finally wanted to crawl up, he discovered that there was a humongous weight on his chest, preventing him from moving. Looking down, he realized that there was a foot on his chest. Moreover, it was this foot that was preventing him from moving.

At this moment, his memories came flooding back.

Gasp!

He had been defeated in a single strike!

When this thought flashed through his mind, he felt so embarrassed that he wanted to die. Just then, he had still been boasting with arrogance, saying that he would teach Ling Han some discipline. Now, however, he had been defeated in a single strike.

A genius idea suddenly occurred to him, and he immediately pretended that he had been knocked unconscious. He cocked his head and fell limp to the ground.

The Celestial Kings were all astonished upon seeing this. Even though Liu Xi wasn’t especially strong, he was still a First Heaven Celestial King, after all. Even those at the peak stage of the First Heaven wouldn’t be able to defeat him with such ease.

“It’s due to the difference in their aptitude,” a Third Heaven Celestial King said.

The other Celestial Kings nodded in agreement. Ling Han was most likely a prodigy among the outsiders. Perhaps he was a monarch tier, or maybe even a rumored monarch star. Because of this, he was able to easily defeat a First Heaven Celestial King as a newly advanced Celestial King.

However, the Third Heaven Celestial Kings thought nothing more of this. Regardless of how freakish Ling Han was, he would still be limited by his cultivation level. At most, he would only possess a battle prowess at the early stage of the Second Heaven. It couldn’t be any higher.

Another Celestial King stepped forward, and said, “Humph! Hurry up and release him!” There were two ribbons of iridescent light around him, and it was clear that he was a Second Heaven Celestial King.

Since he was willing to step forward, he was naturally confident that he could achieve victory. With a cultivation at the peak stage of the Second Heaven, could he not defeat a First Heaven Celestial King?

The Third Heaven Celestial Kings all nodded in satisfaction. This Celestial King was called Ma Dang, and he was extremely renowned among the Second Heaven Celestial Kings. Many people believed that he would eventually advance to the Third Heaven. This was only a matter of time.

“Since Ma Dang has stepped forward, he’ll be able to handle all of them with ease,” a Celestial King remarked.

“Heh, there’s no need to waste too much effort on these younglings. What I’m curious about is, why did they dare to charge over? I refuse to believe that there’s no one supporting them in the background.”

“Indeed. There’s definitely a scheme behind all this.”

The Third Heaven Celestial Kings all nodded in agreement. Prodigies who could become monarch tiers or even monarch stars were no fools. They clearly knew that this was a dangerous location, yet they still insisted on charging over head-on. There was definitely someone supporting them. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Perhaps they were being directed by the other Third Heaven Celestial Kings?

As they discussed this, Ma Dang launched his first attack.

He remained standing in the same spot, and he simply made a tapping motion with his finger.

Boom!

A ginormous meteor crashed down from the sky, crashing toward Ling Han. It carried with it the Great Dao of Earth, and it yearned to crush Ling Han to smithereens.

Not only that, but the earth around Ling Han also changed drastically. The gravitational force increased immensely, and just this alone was enough to push ordinary First Heaven Celestial Kings to tears in despair.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t have any reaction to this. However, it was impossible for Liu Xi to continue feigning unconsciousness. He instantly started to wail in agony. However, because he was being stepped on by Ling Han, he was completely unable to move. He could only flail his arms and legs as blood gushed from his mouth.

.

It was indeed difficult for Second Heaven Celestial Kings to kill First Heaven Celestial Kings who were intent on fleeing. However, Liu Xi was rendered immobile by Ling Han’s foot now, so how could he flee?

Staring at the fast-approaching meteor, Liu Xi was so terrified that his face became green with terror. If he were struck, he would suffer severe wounds even if he weren’t killed. He would definitely end up in a miserable state.

‘F*ck! If you want to die, then go die yourself! Why drag me along?!’

Liu Xi wanted to cry, yet no tears were forthcoming. At this moment, he truly regretted his decision to step forward. F*ck! A Third Heaven Celestial King had already stepped forward, so why had he insisted on snatching the job?

As he stared at the meteor in the sky, all of his past experiences flashed before his eyes. If he were given another chance, he would definitely become a carefree Celestial King. Just how relaxing and enjoyable would that be? What was the point of thinking about all this useless sh*t? Even though he wouldn’t be able to leave the Celestial Path, First Heaven Celestial Kings were still powerful enough to wander around as they pleased. In any case, even if he returned to the outside world, there would still be Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings above him. As such, what standing would he have?

He truly shouldn’t have given in to greed. He truly shouldn’t have participated in this mess.

However, it was a shame that it was already too late to have any regrets.

‘Hmm? Hang on!’

Liu Xi was already about to close his eyes to await his inevitable demise. However, he suddenly discovered that the meteor in the sky was traveling at an incredibly slow speed.

‘Perhaps time slows down when someone is about to die?’
