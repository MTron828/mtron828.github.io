Chapter 1015: Demonic Snake King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Demonic Snakes started to attack.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Their attacks varied greatly, with some snakes spitting water pellets and other snakes whipping their tails. There were also snakes that rammed the flotsam with their bodies. Anyhow, their goal was all the same, and that was to push Ling Han and the other survivors off the wreckage and into the sea.

Once they fell into the sea, the Demonic Snakes would be able to transform them into food with ease. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Now that it had come to this, none of the cultivators dared to hide their abilities anymore. Otherwise, they really would be seeking death. They all unleashed their full battle prowess.

Although Ling Han didn’t need to worry about his safety, it would still be extremely troublesome if he were to sink to the seabed and have to walk back to shore. Thus, he also unleashed his full strength, using his body like a bow and his Origin Power as arrows as he attacked the snakes in the distance.

He didn’t use the arrows that were forged from Godly metal, yet he was still able to unleash a battle prowess of five stars.

One had to realize that Ling Han’s cultivation level had already reached the early stage of the medium extreme. After an elevation of five stars, his battle prowess was now on par with the middle stage of the medium extreme. As such, the Demonic Snakes with a cultivation level under the high extreme were all insta-killed by his arrows.

This couldn’t be helped. The Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was too fast, and those weaker than Ling Han didn’t have any chance of dodging it at all. Their only choice was to be insta-killed.

Although cultivators were generally afraid of close-quarter combat, they would still only maintain a distance of around seven or eight meters when they fought. This distance could maximize their battle prowess. However, this distance was nothing compared to the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

As a result, no one could compare to Ling Han when it came to the efficiency of slaying enemies.

When Yang Tiecheng saw this, he decided that he might as well only defend and not attack. He would ensure the safety of the wreckage they were on, while Ling Han would freely unleash his most powerful attacks.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu!

The arrows whizzed out one after another, causing huge damage and many deaths among the nest 1 of snakes.

Peng!

The seas instantly parted as a gigantic Demonic Snake slithered out. The patterns on its body were surprisingly silver in color.

“Demonic Snake King!” Yang Tiecheng’s expression instantly became grim.

Shua!

The Demonic Snake King opened its jaws as it appeared and spat a large water pellet at Yang Tiecheng.

This water pellet was no slower than Ling Han’s Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, and it arrived before Yang Tiecheng’s body almost as soon as the Demonic Snake King spat it out.

“Hah!” Yang Tiecheng poured all of his power into his fist as he punched at the water pellet.

Peng!

His fist collided with the water pellet, yet the tremendous force sent him flying hundreds of meters back. Only then did he fall into the sea with a plop.

‘Even the powerful Yang Tiecheng is no match for the Demonic Snake King?’

Everyone was stunned by this sight. Were they all going to die here?

Peng!

A figure surfaced from the sea. This was none other than Yang Tiecheng, and his legs became a blur as he sprinted across the water surface. He was pushing himself to the extreme, and cold sweat was pouring down his face.

The gravity field enveloping this sea was tremendously powerful, meaning that one would need to expend huge amounts of Origin Power if they wanted to resist its pull. Thus, Yang Tiecheng had paid a huge price even though he had only covered a short distance of a mere several hundred meters.

There was nothing he could have done about this, either, as sinking to the bottom would have been as good as dying.

Dozens of giant snakes instantly dashed toward Yang Tiecheng. However, he was a three-star genius on top of being at the consummate level right now, so he was able to kill a snake with each punch that he threw. The air around him instantly became misty with blood.

The Demonic Snake King was enraged, and it immediately slithered back into the sea. When it resurfaced, it was already in front of Yang Tiecheng’s body. Its head was held high as it prepared to spit another water pellet.

“Go!” Ling Han fired another arrow. However, not only did he locate the Demonic Snake King’s weak point with his Eye of Truth this time, but he even activated his divine patterns of flame to increase the might of the arrow.

Even the Demonic Snake King didn’t dare face this attack head on.

Pa!

The Demonic Snake King swatted the Origin Power arrow aside with its tail, yet Yang Tiecheng had already seized the opportunity to escape from before it. He leaped through the air and landed on a wooden plank. Although this plank was small, it was enough to let him catch his breath. The wooden plank bobbed up and down in the sea.

The Demonic Snake King was furious, and it whipped its head around to glare at Ling Han with its lantern-sized eyes. A frosty aura radiated from its body.

Apprehension gripped Ling Han’s heart. The Demonic Snake King was incredibly powerful, and it was probably infinitely close to reaching the Sun Moon Tier. It was because of its overwhelming might that Ling Han felt a cold chill shoot through his body.

Its attack was definitely going to be earth-shattering.

“It was this brat that attracted the attention of the Demonic Snake King!”

“Push him into the sea! Otherwise, we’ll all be dragged down along with him!”

Luo Wu and Fan Yong were also on the same piece of wreckage, and right now, both of them were staring daggers at Ling Han.

It was evident that the Demonic Snake King had its eyes set on Ling Han. Under its powerful attack, the other people on the wreckage would also be affected. However, if they pushed Ling Han off, they would still be able to hold onto their dear life for a little while longer.

As long as they lived, there was still hope that they could survive until the next large ship came. At that time, they would be freed from this precarious situation.

“Why don’t you two jump off?” Ling Han asked coldly. These two people were truly selfish to the extreme. They were already facing such an ordeal, yet the two of them still persisted in causing internal conflict.

“In your dreams! We’ll send you on your way now!” Luo Wu and Fan Yong reached out in unison. They had come here to kill Ling Han anyway, and they had only held back because they had been afraid of the others before. Now that their lives were in danger, what more did they care?

Both of them were elites at the high extreme, so the might of their attacks was naturally astonishing.

Ling Han humphed as he activated his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique. His target was Fan Yong, yet a barrier of light unexpectedly materialized on his body, forcefully blocking his spiritual attack.

Fan Yong roared with laughter, and sneered, “Hahahaha! Young Master bestowed me with this rare treasure that can defend against divine sense attacks! Moreover, it’s a treasure that’s been refined by a great elite at the Heavenly Body Tier. You didn’t expect this, did you?!”

It was a pity that the Divine Sword was with Zuo Xiao right now, or he would have been able to cut Ling Han into two.

This didn’t matter, though, as he and Luo Wu would definitely be able to blast Ling Han into the sea.

Peng!

The two of them attacked in unison, and, sure enough, Ling Han was directly pushed off the wreckage of the ship. He fell into the sea with a plop.

“Ling Han!” Shui Yanyu yelped in astonishment, and jumped into the sea after him.

“Stupid woman!” Fan Yong couldn’t help but curse upon seeing this. However, his expression was relatively dark. He knew how obsessed Zhao Lun was with this woman. Zhao Lun was determined to make her his wife once he advanced to the Sun Moon Tier.

However, there was a 99% chance that Shui Yanyu would die in this sea now, so how were he and Zuo Xiao supposed to explain this to Zhao Lun?

He didn’t have the spare time to mull over this thorny problem now, as the Demonic Snakes had already started to launch a new wave of ferocious attacks.

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

Although there were few beings on both sides, they were all Immortals at the Mountain River Tier, and they were all equivalent to bodies that gathered the essence of heaven and earth. The blood that they shed possessed overwhelming vitality and power, and the nearby seawater was all dyed a bloody red.

This attracted countless weaker fish, but also attracted beings that were more powerful than them at the same time.

A large flat fish appeared; its two eyes were surprisingly located on only one side of its head. Its speed was incredibly quick, and it spread its jaws open as it surfaced from below the sea. At least a dozen giant snakes instantly disappeared into its mouth.

It was a terrifying Demonic Beast at the Sun Moon Tier!
