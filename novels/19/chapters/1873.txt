Chapter 1874: Strongest attack

Under the ice, the movements of the majority of Zhao Qingfengs slowed, and only the original was practically unaffected, continuing to launch his offensive on Ling Han.

But without the support of many Murderous Shadows, the might of this attack was only that.

WIth a strike from Ling Han, peng, Zhao Qingfeng was sent backwards.

“Competing with doppelgangers, come then!” Ling Han exclaimed lowly, and his life force was unleashed, three Battle Beasts walking out from within his body.

Flames turned into the Vermillion Bird, water took the form of the Azure Dragon, and lightning became Zhu Li, and they were all Immortal Beasts of Immortal Beasts[1].

Comparatively speaking, Zhu Li was considerably smaller. It could not be helped—the Source Power of lightning was not qualified to compete with the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water in a contest of Source Powers.

The three Battle Beasts appeared, and instantly roared simultaneously, exuding an aura that could suppress all the heavens for eternity.

“My gods!” On the spectators’ seats, someone grabbed their head, shivering uncontrollably. “Are these really Battle Beasts that have been manifested? Why do I feel like they could insta-kill me with a single blow!”

“Me too,” someone beside him said in a shaking voice. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The moment these three Battle Beasts appeared, at least 99% Severing Mundane Tiers trembled, and even emperor tiers paled, feeling a humiliation that they could not accept.

...They couldn’t even match these three Battle Beasts.

It was enough that they could not match Ling Han. Both he and Zhao Qingfeng were super freaks, but this was only a technique that Ling Han had cast, and they couldn’t hold up against even that, which was something they could not accept at all.

Finally, Zhao Qingfeng looked serious. He, too, discovered the might of these three Battle Beasts.

They were really very strong, and a coldness that made it seem as if he could be killed at any second rose up in him.

However, this kind of coldness did not make him afraid in the slightest. On the other hand, he became incredibly excited. When he went berserk, his only wish was to kill, whether the one being killed was another or himself. Of course, as he was alive even now, it would only be others that were killed.

“Hahahaha!” He laughed madly, multiple seals of great dao appearing on his body. His fighting spirit had taken solid form, and soared straight into the skies.

“Materialize!” he shouted, and the 99 Murderous Shadows turned back into murderous aura, which then materialized into a gigantic human figure.

“Charge!” He charged towards Ling Han, while the Murderous Aura Figure met the three Battle Beasts.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

By now, the battle was divided into two different areas, with Ling Han battling Zhao Qingfeng, while the three Battle Beasts were fighting the Murderous Aura Figure to death.

The battles on both sides were incredibly intense.

Blood splattered. Even if Ling Han’s physique was incredibly tough, it was still inevitable that his skin would be split, but with the toughness of his Godly bones, these were only light injuries. Zhao Qingfeng was not much better off. The Bronze Physique’s defenses also had a limit, and after this limit was surpassed, he, too, would suffer injury.

The two supreme prodigies were both covered with wounds. They had really met a match. It was rare that they could encounter an opponent that could allow them to go all out in battle like this.

...While they could also go all out in a battle against Dividing Soul Tier, they would not have that feeling of pressure as if they were walking on a tightrope, so that would not have the slightest benefit in improving their battle prowess.

“I have found your weakness!” Zhao Qingfeng bared his mouth in a grin. He delivered a series of stabs, the angle of his strikes incredibly tricky, intending to pierce through the boneless parts of Ling Han’s body, and damage Ling Han’s internal organs.

After fighting for so long, he was naturally clear that the toughness of Ling Han’s bones was not something that he could breach, but his skin was not as tough as that. As long as he could avoid the bones, he would be able to inflict a fatal injury on Ling Han.

Ling Han merely humped. If the divine physique that had been cultivated through the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll could be dealt with like that, what right would it have to be ranked above Celestial King Tier techniques?

Wanting to damage his internal organs? Easier said than done!

However, his blood and flesh were too heavily damaged, which would also cause a very serious injury to him, and he could not truly ignore it.

“Ling Han, I am already tired of this!” Zhao Qingfeng declared loudly. His bronze-like body exuded a dazzling brilliance, and his fighting spirit and vitality were burning to the pinnacle.

This state could not be maintained for long. He needed to immediately kill Ling Han, and then gain his breakthrough amidst the slaughter.

“Heaven’s Will Guillotine!” he exclaimed lowly. Boom, his whole person had vanished, and what replaced him was actually a gigantic bronze guillotine. The blade of the guillotine was shockingly his neck connected to his head.

Weng, an indescribable aura rolled out. Ling Han felt as if his whole body had been set rigidly in place, and an indescribable reverence rose up from the depths of his heart. It was as if this guillotine was executing punishment on behalf of the heavens, and he could only accept the punishment without protest.

The bronze guillotine flew over whilst Zhao Qingfeng proudly proclaimed, “I am Heaven’s Will itself!”

This was his strongest secret technique, the strongest attack that drew on the Divine Fetus.

No matter how much of a prodigy you were, you ultimately would not be able to escape being sentenced by heaven’s will.

Your only fate would be death!

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared, and instantly swept away all the negative feelings in his heart. However, the might of this guillotine was indeed frightening. It was really possible that it had approached the level of Yang Soul Tier.

But so what?

The guillotine opened, and harshly chopped out at Ling Han.

Weng, the Regulations of the Great Dao rippled out, celestial light streaking through.

“Not good!” Lu Xianming immediately stood up. Just now, even if there were defensive formations in place, his spirit had still been influenced by the Heaven’s Will Guillotine. He actually hadn’t reacted at the first instant, and only when the guillotine blade chopped down did he finally come back to his senses.

Oh no, Ling Han was dead.

His expression was full of bafflement. Someone being capable of fighting a close battle with Zhao Qingfeng—how hard would it be to find this kind of martial arts prodigy? But now? He had actually been eliminated by Zhao Qingfeng.

Sighing, he slowly sat back down. Since he had already died, it was only a waste of emotion to think further of him.

Meanwhile, Sun Dong yelled out in excitement. He had finally been killed. Now, his a*s could finally be comforted.

Cheng Fengyun was also incredibly elated. After commenting for so many days, his judgment had finally come true for once, which made him practically weep in joy.

Bewitching Maiden Rou and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, meanwhile, were despondent. Though cheers rang out like thunder from all around them, they couldn’t hear the slightest bit of it.

In the end, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was not as confident in Ling Han as the Empress. Otherwise, the Empress would not possibly be worried in the slightest.

As the celestial light dispersed, that guillotine blade was still placed at Ling Han’s neck, but the strike could not go through at all.

They could all see Zhao Qingfeng’s face was filled with shock. This had surpassed his imagination.

He had drawn on the strongest attack of his Divine Fetus. It contained a sliver of Celestial King Tier Regulations, and actually still did not manage to sever Ling Han’s neck and behead him. This was extremely inconceivable.

The cheers in the arena came to an abrupt halt.

What was going on here? He didn’t die even with that? Not only did he not die, he actually did not spill even the slightest drop of blood?

Sun Dong was astounded. Cheng Fengyun was shocked, and a feeling of having fallen into a trap rose up in him.

Ling Han showed a smile, and said, “So this is your strongest move? Nothing impressive!”

He actively channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. To say nothing of Zhao Qingfeng, even if Yan Xianlu himself was here, even if he was a fifth severance, he could not possibly kill Ling Han.

...The defense of the present Ling Han was at least at Yin Soul-level!

“You should take a strike from me too!” Ling Han stated calmly. The power of the Fire Divine Fetus was unleashed, and boom, boundless flames surged out. It was as if a massive explosion had taken place in the whole arena, making everyone widen their eyes as if they were blind. They could not see anything clearly at all.

When the light of the flames washed away, another figure had appeared in the arena. That was an elder that had a tall build, and like an eagle picking up a chicken, he had picked up a person in his hand, and that was Zhao Qingfeng.

His limbs were drooping weakly, and it was unknown whether he was dead or alive.
