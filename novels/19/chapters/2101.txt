Chapter 2102: The old pattern of playing a hero to rescue the beauty

Ling Han chuckled. This person’s hypocrisy really could not be more obvious.

He did not care, though. In any case, he had already decided to make things difficult for this guy, so he could put on a fake act as much as he liked.

They exited the forest, and began heading towards the Roc Heaven.

Lu Hairong did not appear, because Hu Niu had already used a secret technique to communicate with her, and said that their group would be heading directly to the Roc Heaven later, so there was no need for her to worry.

Originally, it was impossible for Lu Hairong to agree, but she suspected that a traitor had appeared within the Roc Palace, and she, as a Celestial King, was instead a bigger target.

If Hu Niu went with Ling Han on one path, and Lu Hairong went on another path, the latter would definitely be able to draw away an extremely large amount of the Four Seas Palace’s attention, paving the path for Hu Niu’s return to the Roc Palace—Ling Han was the heir of?that lord, so she still had considerable trust in Ling Han’s ability to ensure their safety.

And precisely because of this, Lu Hairong did not appear again, but instead followed them from the shadows. When they were about to reach the Roc Heaven, she would leave alone to draw away the attention of the Four Seas Palace.

There was no need to rush their journey to the Roc Heaven. Instead, there was a Transference Portal that crossed Heavens which could save a great amount of time.

There were not many such Transference Portals that crossed Heavenly Realms, because only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings that were versed in the Regulations of Space could set them up, and there were not many such beings in the entire Celestial Realm.

The Roc Heaven was named after the Roc Palace, which showed how prosperous and powerful the Roc Palace had once been that they had been able to occupy the territory of a whole Heavenly Realm. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Unfortunately, the Source Beast, the Roc, had long since disappeared in the passage of history, and the last Imperial Empress of the Roc Palace had died in an ambush, and they were presently undergoing trial and hardship. Perhaps the Roc Heaven would be changing its name after a few more epochs.

On the journey, Yang Xiao continued to show off, relating the history of every place they went. He did have skill at this, being able to tell a story in a pleasant and captivating manner, and fascinating his listeners, and Chen Shuangshuang would continuously nod at this.

Ling Han saw all this happen, and thought that if he did not hurry up and deal with Yang Xiao, his daughter-in-law would be gone.

Thankfully, Chen Shuangshuang was not just insensitive towards Ling Jianxue alone, but was the same towards everyone. Seeing Yang Xiao to curry favor with her so obviously, anyone with the slightest bit of intelligence should have been able to distinguish his intentions, but she only laughed and chuckled cheerily, being astonishingly insensitive.

True, if it could’ve been settled with just some sweet-talking, Ling Jianxue would have long since sweet-talked her into becoming his wife. Why else would there be so much hassle?

Over a dozen days later, they arrived at Wind Capital City, and found an inn to stay in. They would wash away the dirt from the journey, and set out again after some rest. The Transference Portal that crossed Heavenly Realms was located in Wide Western City, which was at least another month’s journey away from here.

At night, Yang Xiao departed quietly. He had previously come here before, and befriended a gang of scoundrels.

And now, it was time for him to make use of this connection.

Ling Han broke into a faint smile. The Xuanyin Source Water Divided Soul walked out from his body, and tailed Yang Xiao, while his original body continued to play mahjong with the Empress, Hu Niu, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was serving tea and water from the sidelines, completely behaving like a little wife.

Wind Capital City was also a large city. Yang Xiao flew all the way, crossing mountains and seas, and after more than six hours, he finally arrived at a small village.

“Young Master Yang!”

“Young Master Yang!”

“Young Master Yang, long time no see.”

When they saw Yang Xiao, the villagers all greeted him respectfully. He was an heir of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. He only had to say one casual word, and their Vicious Bear Gang would be completely destroyed overnight.

Yang Xiao bore a slightly reserved smile. In the past, when he had come to Wind Capital City, a conflict had risen up between him and the Vicious Bear Gang because of a minor matter. However, when the Gang Leader of Vicious Bear Gang, Xiong Si, found out about his origins, he immediately brought valuable gifts to him as settlement for their dispute.

Xiong Si was a Yang Soul elite, yet lowered himself to address Yang Xiao as brother, which made the latter feel very respected, and they had also gradually become good friends.

“Is Brother Si here?” he asked.

“Yes! Yes!” A gang member hurriedly led the way, bringing Yang Xiao to a manor. Very soon, they arrived at the main hall, and there was presently a show of song and dance. A banquet was presently being held.

“Hahahaha, my dear brother Yang!” A tall and well-built man walked forwards to greet him. He really was like a vicious bear given human form. It was the present master of the Vicious Bear Gang, Xiong Si. He spread out his arms to embrace Yang Xiao.

“Brother Si!” Yang Xiao also spread out his own arms to greet him.

The two men exchanged a greeting hug for a while, and then released each other.

“My good brother, why do you have time to see your Brother Si today?” Xiong Si asked with a smile.

“There is a matter that I would like to ask for your help in, Brother Si.” Yang Xiao was not reserved, either.

Though Xiong Si’s cultivation level far surpassed his, he did not have much reverence towards Xiong Si, because the former was only the leader of a gang of scoundrels. Even if he was strong, so what? How could he compare to Yang Xiao, who was a proper and noble disciple of a great sect?

“If you have trouble, go ahead and tell me. As long as it’s doable, Brother Si would definitely not refuse.” Xiong Si clapped a hand on his chest, displaying a heroism that reached to the clouds.

“It really is just a small matter,” Yang Xiao said. He smiled. “I like a girl, but that girl doesn’t seem to have much affection towards me yet, so I would like to ask Brother Si to help me arrange a good show of the hero rescuing the beauty.”

“Haha, I understand, I understand!” Xiong Si laughed loudly, patting Yang Xiao’s shoulder. “All beautiful women love heroes. I will definitely send out someone to perform as perfectly as possible so that my dear brother can put on a majestic and mighty display as a hero.”

“If there was some other scene, it would be even better.” Yang Xiao considered for a moment. “For example, the people that Brother Si sends could drug that girl with some aphrodisiac or something.”

F***, this guy was really quite despicable.

Xiong Si thought this in his heart, but the smile on his face became brighter. “Sure. Of course, no problem at all.”

Yang Xiao showed an expectant expression. Tomorrow, when Chen Shuangshuang was assaulted by the evil tyrants, he would interfere when she was in the most danger, saving Chen Shuangshuang, which would definitely make her heart beat faster for him.

And afterwards, when the aphrodisiac took effect, he would pretend to use all sorts of excuses, yet in the end, the matter would be settled, and then it would be too late to change anything, so how would he need to fear that Chen Shuangshuang wouldn’t be dead set on him in the future?

To deal with this kind of insensitive woman, there was definitely a need for extreme measures.

Ling Han stood on the roof. This divided soul was manifested from the Xuanyin Source Water. When he withheld his aura, he would be no different from a drop of water. To say nothing that there were a few Yang Souls beneath him, even if there was an Immortal Palace Tier, there was no way the latter could discover his presence.

So that was the case.

Ling Han chuckled, and changed his plans of charging downstairs to eliminate a vile character like Yang Xiao. It was better for him to let Chen Shuangshuang see clearly the latter’s true nature. With such a comparison, she would be able to tell how valuable Ling Jianxue’s fondness for her was.

Sigh, he was really going to a lot of trouble for the sake of his son.

Ling Han turned, and he soon disappeared without a trace with a leap.

“My dear brother, I have recently obtained a secret technique, and have been thinking of finding a time to contact you so we could study it together, and it just so happened that you have come today,” Xiong Si said.

“Oh, what kind of secret technique?” Yang Xiao asked carelessly, not taking it to heart at all.

What kind of secret technique could a gangster actually have?

Yang Xiao was an heir of the Heavenly Saint Palace, and any celestial technique that he had would be considered a supreme secret technique by countless other forces.

Xiong Si chuckled. He could see the other’s disdain, but did not refute this. He only said, “This secret technique can allow one’s battle prowess to instantly soar 10 times over.”

“What!?” Yang Xiao immediately leaped to his feet, appearing incredibly stunned.

‘A tenfold boost of battle prowess, are you kidding me?’
