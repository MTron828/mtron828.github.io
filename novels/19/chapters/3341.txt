Chapter 3342: Demon Race

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Brother Wolfs cloak exploded, revealing his true appearance, yet it caused everyone to gape widely.

What did they just see?

Was this a human?

If Brother Wolf was wearing a cloak, no one would say that he didn’t look human, but once the cloak was taken off, there would be a huge difference, because he actually had the head of a wolf!

Not only that, his whole body was furry, and his five claws were sharp, exuding a cold light.

No wonder his entire body had been wrapped in a cloak just now, and it looked like those he had injured had been scratched by sharp claws. That was because this was the truth.

“What? It’s actually a wolf!”

“But how can a wolf speak?”

“Moreover, no matter what, he looks like a human!

Everyone exclaimed in shock. Who would have thought that among the envoys of the Yue Empire, there was actually a wolf… a wolfman?

Ling Han was also astonished. ‘Have you f*cking developed intelligence?’ However, even though a Blood Transformation Tier Demonic Beast had undergone a massive leap in level of being, it shouldn’t have been able to stand on its hind legs and speak human language, right?

He asked directly, “What medicine have you taken that you can actually speak. “Yi, how did you know I ate the Transformation Fruit?” This wolfman asked curiously.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I don’t know. You were the one who told me.” The wolfman rubbed his furry head, and couldn’t help but look annoyed. As it turned out, he had let the cat out of the bag.

Ling Han shook his head and said, “Although you look human, your intelligence still hasn’t improved.”

“Damn it, don’t think that you’ve won!” the wolfman roared loudly. His whole body began to swell, as if he had been pumped full of energy, becoming a whole size larger and broader.

His blood and Qi boiled, and he entered a state of explosive power.

It was really different.

Ling Han didn’t unleash his blood and Qi. He only had one chance to unleash his power, and this would last for 10 minutes. Moreover, this wolf-man clearly wasn’t worthy of him unleashing his power.

He unleashed his Shuttle Steps, and his speed soared to two times the speed of sound. It wasn’t difficult for him to dodge the attacks of even an Extreme Bone

Tier.

The speed of the two of them was extremely fast, as quick as lightning, making it difficult for the eyes to catch sight of them.

As everyone watched, they were all dazzled.

Previously, when the wolfman had not been boiling with blood and Qi, he was able to dodge the attack of Man Hongsheng, who was in his explosive state, but now that he had exploded, he was completely unable to hit Ling Han. With such a comparison, it could be seen just how strong Ling Han was.

Hiss, who was this masked man? He was too powerful, wasn’t he? It should be known that even Hong Tianliang had lost to this man.

The wolfman repeatedly failed to hit Ling Han, and couldn’t help but roar, “Human, are you a rat? Why do you only know how to run?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and thought, ‘You didn’t encounter that Demonic Rat from the hunting ground. If you still dare to say this after seeing this Demonic Beast, then I’ll really respect you for being a man.’

He ignored him, and after drawing out the distance between them, he brandished his fists repeatedly.

Pu, pu, pu! The force hit the wolfman’s body, but not even a single hair was knocked off.

“Foolish human, after I have unleashed my full power, not only did my power and speed rise explosively, but even my defense also rose explosively. How can your boiling blood and Qi compare?” the wolfman said proudly.

Everyone was indignant. This wolfman would say “you humans” time and again at the drop of a hat. It was completely releasing powerful moves to attract

animosity.

“This big brother, hurry up and kill this Demon Wolf. I’ll treat you to some wine,” someone shouted at Ling Han.

“I’ll treat you to a drink too.”

“From now onwards, you are my friend.”

“I’ll introduce my sister to you.”

Ling Han glanced at the person who wanted to become his brother-in-law, and couldn’t help but shudder. ‘Please, your face is so fierce, and you’re as sturdy as a large rock. It’s really hard to imagine how your sister looks like.1 -Die!” The wolfman brandished his claws, and instantly, multiple streaks of dark light adhered to the force of the blow, sweeping towards Ling Han. An attack that was imbued with high-level energy was incredibly terrifying.

However, what use was it if he couldn’t hit his target?

Ling Han humphed, “Do you think that only you can do it?”

He also used his Spiritual Power to communicate with high-level energy, and a layer of golden energy immediately enshrouded his hands. Boom, he threw a punch, and the golden energy added with the force blasted out.

The wolfman brandished his claws in an attack. Peng, the two energies collided, and blood immediately splattered from the wolfman’s hands.

Seeing this scene, even Young Master Hu looked shocked.

This meant that the high-level energy that Ling Han stimulated had surpassed the wolfman.

How was this possible?

How could a mere human be so strong?

Hong Tianliang’s mouth was also wide open in shock.

Ling Han had actually also mastered high-level energy? And it was that awesome?

This was the only thing he was proud of, but now?

His pride was once again crushed. What part of him could compare to Ling Han?

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and shot out a series of punches. Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu! The force of his attacks roared madly, and golden light intertwined.

The wolfman’s current strength surpassed Ling Han’s, but his speed was still only more than double the speed of sound, not two times. This meant that Ling Han could easily dodge his attack, but as for the attack that Ling Han delivered?

It would be extremely difficult!

There were some that he could dodge, and there were some that he couldn’t. Furthermore, the force that was imbued with golden energy was indestructible, and could easily tear through his defenses. Just like that, he was only injured and unable to fight back. Just how sullen did this make him? The wolfman roared in fury, but this did not change the fact that he was being beaten up madly.

However, his toughness was very strong. It was as if he was a born warrior. If he didn’t fight until he was exhausted, and if he didn’t fight until only the last drop of his blood was left, he would definitely not collapse.

Even Ling Han couldn’t help but feel slightly impressed. However, he showed no mercy, defeating the wolfman with a crushing force.

Peng, the wolfman flew out of the tournament stage, and lay on the ground, unable to stand up again.

Admiration was one thing, but they were on different sides, so there was naturally no reason for Ling Han to go easy on him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Good one!”

“Beat this b@stard to death!”

“Who asked you to be so arrogant!”

Everyone was cheering. Previously, the wolfman had won many battles, suppressing them so much that they could barely breathe. Now that Ling Han had defeated the wolfman, they were naturally cheering in joy.

“Little Wolf!” The cloaked people scrambled out one after another, carrying the wolfman back. When they discovered that he had only suffered some superficial injuries, and had passed out from exhaustion, they immediately relaxed.

“Who are you?” A cloaked person jumped onto the tournament stage, “Take off your mask!”

He did not give Ling Han any chance to argue. He stretched out a hand, and the cloak instantly fell to the ground.

This was still not a human. Though he looked very much alike, he had a goat’s head, and two small horns, which exuded the coldness of metal.

The Yue Empire… was it a Majestic Empire made up of Demonic Beasts? Ling Han immediately shook his head internally. He was a dignified human, the essence of intelligence, so how could he possibly submit to a Demonic Beast?

“If you can defeat me, you can naturally remove my mask. Come at me with your own strength!” he stated calmly.

-What an arrogant human!” The goatman appeared to be very furious. With a bounce of his feet, peng, he exploded with astonishing speed.

Yi, he was obviously a Blood Transformation Tier elite, but why had his speed reached two times the speed of sound?

Ling Han clenched his hand into a fist, and shot out a punch at the other. Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and both of them were sent backwards, and it was hard to tell any difference between their power.

“Again!” the goatman roared. He threw a punch, no, a hoof, that was enshrouded in a layer of dusky energy..
