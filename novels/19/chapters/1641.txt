Chapter 1642: Saint!

Even if there was only a single step separating the Eternal River Tier and Genesis Tier, as someone who had personally experienced it, Long Yushan knew very well just how very difficult it was to breach this step.

She herself could be considered extraordinarily talented. Not only was her natural talent astonishing, her ancestral bloodline was thick, but even so, she had still spent 2,000,000 years’ time to get from the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier to Genesis Tier.

Over a dozen years...

Gasp!

She could no longer see through Ling Han. Not only could she not distinguish his cultivation level, she could not distinguish his age, either. She only knew that he was especially young. That vitality that burned as brightly as a furnace was practically enough to kill over half the elites in this world.

This was really not fearing someone who didn’t know what was what, but fearing to be compared. In front of Ling Han, who else would dare call himself a prodigy?

Her eyes drifted, and turned to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint. Involuntarily, she was even more stunned.

Another two Saints!

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also incredibly young, while the Notionless Saint was the opposite. Though his vitality was also very exuberant, an aged feeling seeped out from his soul. He should be one that had been reborn through possessing the body of another. That was why the age of his body and spirit were completely different.

“My three friends!” Long Yushan did not dare to put on any airs of seniority, and greeted Ling Han and his companions with clasped hands.

Though she had witnessed Ling Han kill a Saint before, and she knew that she could not treat him like any normal Eternal River Tier, Saints naturally had the pride of Saints. Just like the Saint Kings of the various Forbidden Lands, it was only after Ling Han had become a Small Saint that they began to finally address him as “friend”, acknowledging his identity and status.

The Notionless Saint and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden returned the greeting. Seeing that Ling Han seemed to be very polite to her, they were naturally filled with goodwill towards her as well.

Yet Long Xiangyue was watching dumbfounded. Why had Aunty called all three of them as friends?

Wait... Could it be!

She did not dare believe it, and exclaimed in shock, “Ling Han, you have broken through to the Saint Tier?”

Pu!

Those who had heard her exclamation in the area suddenly spluttered in laughter.

This little girl was really ignorant. She had to have popped out of some unknown corner under a rock, actually thinking that that young man was a Saint!

What a joke, just how many Saints were there in the whole Immortal Realm? Furthermore, which one of them did not have gray hair? Without cultivating until looking like they were about to die, how could they possibly become a Saint?

...This was the impression that the majority had of Saints. They were either old men or old women. If you were not old, how could you have possibly become a Saint?

And Ling Han was clearly astonishingly young in appearance. His cultivation level was indistinguishable, but his vitality was exuberant. What part of him looked old in any way?

“En.” Ling Han nodded. With his present strength, he no longer had to fear anyone in the Ancient Realm.

“That’s great!” Long Xiangyue exclaimed, clapping her hands, and felt pride fill her whole heart.

The man that she had her eye on naturally had to be as extraordinary as this.

“Little girl, do not be deceived!” someone spoke up, and advised her, “There have been many conmen recently, and they claimed to be either elites themselves or the descendants of some great force. Actually, they are all unknown nobodies who are professionals at conning others out of their wealth and tricking young girls.”

Long Xiangyue was furious. They actually called Ling Han a conman? Pei, she actually wanted Ling Han to trick her, but the latter didn’t want her at all.

She was not an unreasonable person. The other had only advised her with good intentions, so she did not show her temper. She only pretended she had not heard him, and ignored him completely.

“Ling Han, you’re so great!” She looked at Ling Han, stars almost visible in her shining eyes.

“Silly girl!” The man that had advised her previously couldn’t help but shake his head repeatedly. Tsk, such a pretty little girl would actually be so dumb to be tricked by another, and would still think the latter was innocent.

“Oh, a Saint? Why don’t I ask for some guidance from you!” A young man strode out with an expression of great pride on his face while raising a brow at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Long Xiangyue, and Long Yushan.

His meaning was clear. Look, he was the person that rightfully deserved their admiration!

“This person is the seventh young master of the Yang Clan, right?”

“Precisely, he’s Yang Ming. He is said to have reached the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier 3,000 years ago. Initially, he should have a chance to enter into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, but an unforeseen event happened in the Yang Clan, and that was why he lost that chance. Otherwise, with Yang Ming’s natural talent, he definitely would be qualified to become a disciple of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy.”

“Hiss, a disciple of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy? Then doesn’t that mean that he would have a chance of becoming a Saint?”

“Of course. All the disciples of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy have potential to become Saints.”

The passersby all murmured softly. There were definitely some among them that recognized that young man as they called out his identity, which was extremely illustrious.

...There was a consensus in the several hundred galaxies in the surrounding area, and that was if anyone could enter into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, he was definitely a prodigy among prodigies. In future, even if he could not become a Saint, it was a sure bet that he could advance into the Eternal River Tier.

Was that not awesome enough? Just how many Saints were there in the whole Immortal Realm? On average, there was only one per galaxy.

Below the Saint Tier, the next strongest would be Eternal River Tier. In future, Yang Ming would definitely be stronger than all the rest, and weaker than only Saints, which was enough to make others extremely envious!

“Yang Ming!” There were already a few women screaming in a besotted fashion. They waved their hands, wanting nothing more than to throw themselves into his arms.

Yang Ming stood arrogantly, his nose raised so high that it was pointing skywards.

“Just look, this is what a young elite is like, having the bearing of a king tier.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. With his present strength and status, he really had no interest to drop down to the level of this kind of “junior”. He only asked Long Yushan, “Should we enter together?”

“All right!” Long Xiangyue hurriedly agreed as if she was afraid that Long Yushan would object.

Long Yushan couldn’t help but sigh internally. She naturally could tell her niece’s intentions, but Ling Han did not look like he bore the same feelings in the slightest. This was destined to only be a one-sided crush.

She had to find a chance to talk with Long Xiangyue. She could not allow her to endlessly sink into a hopeless romance like this.

“Let’s go!”

They set off, wanting to enter into the ancient site.

“You!!” Yang Ming couldn’t help but stomp in fury. He immediately caught up with them with a single step, and grabbed at Ling Han’s shoulder. “Mr. ‘Saint’, let us have a spar!”

Ling Han slightly released the aura of a Saint. Pa, Yang Ming immediately collapsed on the ground, heavy drops of cold sweat dripping down his forehead. He felt as if he had just passed by the gateway to hell, his body trembling madly.

“S-S-S-Saint!” he uttered in a shaking voice. This definitely was the aura of a Saint Tier. Because he had already reached the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier, even an Eternal River Tier could not possibly scare him to such an extent with a mere wisp of his aura.

Pu!

Many people in the area spluttered. They stared with shock and gaping mouths, as if they were dead fish.

Saint?

Really a Saint?

‘Impossible!’

But how could it be that Yang Ming would blurt this out without thinking? He was a young king tier in the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. If he blurted nonsense, how would he be able to face others in future?

Gasp!

How could there be such a young Saint?

Yang Ming couldn’t help but kneel down, and respectfully paid his greetings to Ling Han. He actually dared have ideas about a Saint’s woman! That he had not struck him dead with a single palm strike was really being merciful to the extreme!

“G-greetings, Saint!” He prostrated on the ground, using a most humble posture to express his remorse.

Ling Han had not planned to drop down to his level in the first place, so he simply waved him off casually.

Only then did Yang Ming dare to stand back up. He was filled with gratitude towards Ling Han. He had never thought that there would be such an easy-going and amicable Saint.

“Stand right there!” Ling Han and his companions were about to set off again when they heard a sharp shout, and they saw that the young man that had previously fled in a sorry state had come back. There was a middle-aged man that had the cultivation level of the Heavenly Body Tier beside him. He was releasing his aura without reservations, appearing to be very arrogant.

“You dare to even make a move on a member of our Tong Clan, are you all tired of living?” the middle-aged man called out sharply.
