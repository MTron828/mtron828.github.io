Chapter 997: Wishful Thinking

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han ignored Sha Yuan’s offer.

He was indeed in desperate need of more True Origin Stones. Although he had just earned 4,000,000, he only had a measly 10,000 left after spending a vast majority of the money during the auction. Moreover, he had actually wanted to bid on a few more items, yet his lack of money prevented him from doing so.

After all, he still had to leave some True Origin Stones for cultivation, right?

At any rate, regardless of how desperate he was, he definitely wouldn’t teach the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to others. Even if he wanted to, he had no way of teaching it. This was because the level of this cultivation technique was far too high.

Sha Yuan didn’t lose his temper upon seeing Ling Han’s lack of response. Instead, he clapped his hands, and said, “Dong Yue, Mei’er, you two go over to entertain my friend!”

“Understood!” the two females replied sweetly. They slowly walked to Ling Han’s sides and were just about to lean into his body.

Ling Han frowned and made a pushing motion with his arms, causing the two females to slide backward.

“What, are you not satisfied?” Sha Yuan was slightly surprised, and he explained, “Dong Yue and Mei’er are the most popular girls in Fragrant Pavilion. Not only are they beautiful like flowers, but their cultivation levels are also at the Mountain River Tier.”

With the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire’s huge population, the term “beautiful” was in fact quite ordinary. One in 10 females could be considered beautiful, while one in 100 females could be considered exceptionally beautiful.

It could be said that beauties were not rare or special in this Majestic Empire.

However, beauties at the Immortal level were much rarer.

It was a barrier, and even with the resources of the Immortal Realm, only very few people could advance into the Immortal level. Thus, this pavilion was also quite capable, seeing as they were able to hire two beauties at the Mountain River Tier to accompany guests.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If Brother Sha has nothing else to say, then please excuse me for taking my leave!”

“What’s the hurry?” Sha Yuan said quickly. However, a hint of displeasure flashed across his eyes as he spoke. ‘You’re a mere ant from a small world, yet you actually dare refer to me as brother? Pei!’

He still wanted to obtain Ling Han’s cultivation technique, though, so he forcefully kept his emotions under control.

He smiled, and said, “You still don’t know, right? Dong Yue and Mei’er’s techniques are dream-like!”

Ling Han was stunned. ‘Is this really a f*cking Great General’s son? Why does he seem like a pimp? He’s even talking about their techniques! He’s truly drunk...’

He immediately stood up. Even if he was desperate, he still wouldn’t touch females from brothels.

“You’re not satisfied with them?” Sha Yuan still thought that Ling Han was merely repulsed by the two females’ identities. He chuckled, and said, “Ling Han, as long as you’re willing to give me the cultivation technique, I can even consider giving my four maids to you. To tell you the truth, all four of them are still virgins!”

Seeing so many beauties by Ling Han’s side, Sha Yuan believed that Ling Han was merely a lustful person. As such, he would definitely be captivated by beauties.

As if they were puppets, Liu Ying and the three other females’ expressions didn’t change.

Ling Han sighed in his mind. ‘How sorrowful!’

However, he didn’t have the time or patience to deal with others’ matters, and he immediately replied, “A noble person doesn’t seize that which is owned by others. Now, please excuse me!”

“Ling Han!!” Sha Yuan’s expression became stern, and he said, “Don’t test my patience! Don’t think for a second that you can look down on everyone just because you have the support of the Ninth King! Don’t forget, you’re merely an ant from a small world!”

“Thank you for your reminder!” Ling Han said emotionlessly. His impression of Sha Yuan had already fallen to rock-bottom.

Truth be told, although Zhao Lun would seek revenge for the smallest of grievances and was also extremely domineering, he still seemed to be much more impressive when compared to Sha Yuan.

The nine sons of a dragon were all different 1 . Sure enough, even Great General Sha wasn’t exempt from this. Apart from his relatively strong talent in cultivation, Sha Yuan was really no different from ordinary rich playboys.

Sha Yuan raised his voice, and said, “Ling Han, this is the final warning!”

Ling Han ignored him and calmly walked away.

Peng!

Sha Yuan heavily slammed the table, sending glasses flying and causing wine to flow down the tables.

“Young Master Sha!” Dong Yue and Mei’er both leaned over and called at him seductively.

If it was any other time, Sha Yuan would definitely have been all smiles as he embraced them in his arms and let his hands roam over their bodies. Now, however, he humphed angrily as he pushed both the females to the floor.

“You really think that the Ninth King will be attracted to someone like you?” His voice became cold, and he said, “Liu Ying, keep a close eye on him. Immediately report back to me if he makes any moves.”

“Understood!” Liu Ying half knelt as she accepted Sha Yuan’s command.

Ling Han shook his head as he walked out of the pavilion.

Exchanges were supposed to be done on a basis of mutual agreement, much less one that entailed a secret technique. Wasn’t it normal for him to reject such a request?

This rich young master had probably never experienced such kind of rejection before, nor did he accept others’ refusal of his requests.

Ling Han immediately entered the Black Tower after returning to the Academy.

“Small Tower, how do I plant this?” Ling Han retrieved the seed of the Reincarnation Tree.

“I’ll cultivate a piece of land first!” Small Tower’s voice was quite serious, which was completely different from normal. This made Ling Han realize that the seed of the Reincarnation Tree was tremendously valuable even in the eyes of Small Tower.

Boom!

Small Tower was the true ruler of the Black Tower, and under its manipulation, a piece of land that was brimming with spiritual energy was quickly cultivated.

One had to realize that no matter what Ling Han had planted before, Small Tower had always been half-hearted and indifferent. Right now, however, it was actually personally cultivating a piece of land to plant the seed. This made it abundantly clear just how much Small Tower valued this seed.

“Your luck is truly through the roof,” Small Tower said. “The Reincarnation Tree is a supremely precious treasure. Strange. Why does this place have a Reincarnation Tree?”

Ling Han opened the pouch and found a seed that was the size of a broad bean resting inside. Its body was full of circles, and looking closely, one would realize that these circles were infinite in number.

Ling Han only looked at it for an instant, yet he already felt as if he had expended all of his mental energy. A layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.

No wonder this seed could be appraised as a Reincarnation Tree even on the Joint Peace Planet, where the overall cultivation level was relatively low. It was indeed very peculiar and impossible to fake.

“Plant it,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han tossed the seed into the newly cultivated land, after which Small Tower cast some special force to act on the piece of land. The land instantly started to glow with mysterious multicolored light. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Done. All we have to do is wait patiently now.” There was a hint of exhaustion in Small Tower’s voice.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Thanks for your hard work!”

He exited the Black Tower, and started to examine his Cloud Piercing Shuttle. He obviously had to learn how to control this item before they set off.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle was only three or so meters long. It was sleek and silver-white, and it looked much like a silver shuttle 1 . Thus, its internal volume was naturally small, with only two people being able to fit on each row and only two rows in total.

This was no problem for Ling Han, as he had the Black Tower, which was equivalent to having limitless space.

After a short while, Ling Han finally understood how to control the Cloud Piercing Shuttle.

He then informed the Academy that he was about to leave for a mission.

This was a necessary process, especially since Ling Han had another identity—he was the emperor of the Great Ling Empire. He was a hostage right now, so he needed to receive approval before he could leave the Imperial Capital. Otherwise, it would be seen as a provocation to the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

Two days later, he received approval from the Academy.
