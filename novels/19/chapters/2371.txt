Chapter 2372: Forced away

When one had reached the height of Celestial King Tier, who did not just have the Dao of Heaven and Earth in their hearts, with their only purpose just to become the strongest?

Shang Zhiwei was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Though she was not the most powerful existence in the world, there were but a mere three or four people that could surpass her. Yet, for the sake of being with her beloved, she did not hesitate to fuse herself with Heavenly Dao.

What was even more touching was the truth that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had already died, and only left behind a weak sliver of divine sense in the realm. Rather than calling him still alive, it would be more accurate to say that he was a slave, forever trapped here.

However, Shang Zhiwei had still chosen to fuse with Heavenly Dao without the slightest hesitation.

This kind of love was to be respected, and to be pitied as well.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable sighed. “Zhiwei, is it worth it?” He could not do anything, and could only say this.

He could interfere with the two Heavenly Venerates because Heavenly Venerates were not recognized by the heaven and earth in the first place. He had only intensified the strength of the backlash from the heaven and earth. However, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was still in the system of the heaven and earth, so he could do absolutely nothing.

Because he had long since died, and what was left behind now was only a sliver of thought.

Even Ling Han was incredibly moved. Because of Hu Niu, he had always felt conflicted about Shang Zhiwei, yet now he felt that this woman was truly worthy of the greatest admiration. However, if it was he, he would definitely be unwilling for his own women to end their lives in such a manner.

However, no one could stop Shang Zhiwei. Flames were burning on her whole body. This was her actively burning her life force. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King was destroying herself, so who would dare approach? If they were implicated, that would definitely mean death. Only a Heavenly Venerate could ignore those flames.

But now the three great Heavenly Venerates were fighting intensely, and not one of them could possibly make a move to stop her.

Boom, Shang Zhiwei had completely burned up, turning into a flame, which finally dispersed in the realm. However, before fusing with Dao, there was not a sliver of pain or reluctance on her face. Her expression was only filled with love. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Several epochs had passed, and she was actually able to see her beloved once more. This kind of great joy exceeded all else.

She was tired, and only wished to lie in the arms of her beloved, never waking up.

Crack, the heaven and earth grieved, expressing their sorrow at the passing of a Celestial King.

“Silly girl! Silly girl!” The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was incredibly rueful. He stretched out his hand, and forcefully captured Shang Zhiwei’s dispersing spirit.

Even if she was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, her Dao would be destroyed once she died. She would disperse completely, not leaving behind the slightest bit of trace of herself in this realm.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was going against the heavens. He had forcefully gathered Shang Zhiwei’s spirit, and then conformed it with heaven and earth.

Though it was forever impossible for Shang Zhiwei to come back to life, she would also never die. She would exist spiritually in the realm, being by the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s side for eternity.

From everyone’s perspective, this was an incredibly unfortunate matter, but as Shang Zhiwei saw it, perhaps this was the best conclusion for her.

No matter how big the realm, how powerful she became, and how strong she was, without the company of her beloved, what meaning was there to it?

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had also exerted his strongest efforts. He could not revive Shang Zhiwei, and could only make it so that her spirit would eternally be left in the realm.

He shook his head, but Shang Zhiwei could not manifest. She was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and was not qualified to leave behind an imprint of herself in the realm.

On the other side, the battle of the three great Heavenly Venerates was also gradually reaching boiling point, and also caused the targeting from the heaven and earth to become even more frightening. This was not the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable causing trouble, but rather that their destructive power was really too terrifying.

All of a sudden, the three great Heavenly Venerates all stopped. If they continued fighting, they would all be done for. It could not be helped. Who asked them to all be First Tier Heavenly Venerates. As long as they had not surpassed the heaven and earth, they would still be restrained by the heaven and earth.

“From today onwards, whoever dares to target this brat will be making an enemy of me!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was incredibly domineering, his eyes passing over the great Celestial Kings, filled with threat.

“And as for the two of you…” He looked at Sealed Emotion and Jiuwu. “If the two of you dare to target this brat again, I will kill every single one of your line!”

“Are you threatening me?” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable asked menacingly. He had been angered.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le scoffed. “So what if I am? If you dare make a move on this brat, I dare to eliminate your line. So what if you are unconvinced or displeased? I don’t care!”

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s expression instantly appeared very ugly. Since having become a Heavenly Venerate, when had he been threatened like this? When they had reached heights that they did, they were all working for the sake of transcendence, so how could they possibly care about other matters?

But it was a different story for the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, who looked like an absolute ruffian.

The problem was that this kind of threat was extremely effective.

Whether it was Sealed Emotion or Jiuwu, they both had their descendants and heirs. Though beings like them did not attach too much importance to kinship, who would be willing to really have their whole line eliminated?

Furthermore, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was really very strong. Only when the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate worked together were they able to stand against him, which made this kind of threat even more realistic because Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had not said that he would spare the two of them.

‘…Damn it, how has this guy’s strength soared so greatly?’

“However, I can also give the two of you a chance to kill him.” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s words took another turn. “As long as they are not superior to this brat by more than two minor levels, anyone can make a move on him. I will definitely not interfere.”

When these words fell, Ling Han couldn’t help but grit his teeth. He knew that the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was trying to temper him.

However, this Heavenly Venerate had a really high opinion of him, to actually give the allowance of two minor levels.

It should be known that it was not that the Celestial Realm did not have Monarch Stars. For example, if Ji Wuming was superior to Ling Han by two minor levels, just how powerful would his battle prowess be?

However, no one knew that Ling Han’s most powerful strength now was not his cultivation level, but rather his Body Art!

Under the tempering of the power of heaven and earth, his Body Art had already far surpassed his cultivation level. Even a supreme monarch star like Xue Ge could only be pummeled at his hand. They wanted to kill him with an advantage of just two minor levels?

Unless the other was also as much of a freak as he was, and had long since touched the power of heaven and earth, this was impossible. Even a freak like Ji Wuming could not do so.

If it was a Heavenly Venerate that had reincarnated, and was cultivating from the very beginning again, then it would be possible.

But how could it be that a Heavenly Venerate would reincarnate and cultivate from the beginning just for the sake of killing Ling Han? Wasn’t that a joke?

“Sealed Emotion, Jiuwu, do you agree?” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le asked, his dominance soaring.

Both Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate were speechless. The two of them joining forces only managed to barely match Wu Le, and even if the Green Flames Heavenly Venerate, who had not showed himself all this while, was added into the equation, the three great Heavenly Venerates indeed would able to suppress Wu Le together, but it would be completely delusional if they intended to kill this man just like that.

When strength had reached the level that the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had reached, aside from a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, who else would be able to detain him?

They could only leave to seek out Green Flames, and discuss the matter before making their next move.

The two great Heavenly Venerates wore an expression like they had eaten a dead child. They each nodded lightly, turned around, and ripped a hole in space, leaving.

…They would definitely send their most outstanding disciples to kill Ling Han. Additionally, they would also find Green Flames Heavenly Venerate as soon as possible so that the three of them could cooperate to deal with Wu Le. Otherwise, when the passageway of the two realms reopened, who knew what kind of problem Heavenly Venerate Wu Le would cause again?

They were incredibly anxious, wanting to transcend, and with this priority in mind, anything else could be discarded. They could sacrifice anything for the sake of this.

As they watched the two great Heavenly Venerates actually leaving dejectedly, everyone was in extreme disbelief.

These were Heavenly Venerates, supreme beings, and they had actually been forced away!

Was the world about to change?
