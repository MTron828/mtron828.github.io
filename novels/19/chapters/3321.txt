“Bullsh*t!” Hong Tianliang couldn’t help but curse.

He was confident that he was already invincible in Blood Transformation Tier. Yet, Ling Han actually said that there were three ways to defeat him?

“First.” Ling Han activated Shuttle Steps, and his speed instantly soared to twice the speed of sound.

Under such high speed, even after his blood boiled, Hong Tianhang still couldn’t touch a corner of his clothes.

After flying at high speed for three minutes, Ling Han stopped, and asked,

“How is it?”

Hong Tianliang was rendered speechless. He had not thought that Ling Han would be able to burst out with such high speed. In fact, Ling Han could still maintain such speed. In this way, Ling Han would completely be able to survive his burst of power, causing him to have wasted his trump card.

This was what he was thinking, yet his clawed hand didn’t stop. Instead, it continued to slash at Ling Han.

“Second!”

Ling Han exclaimed, and also began to boil his blood and Qi, greeting the incoming attack with a punch.

Peng!

In the clash of terrifying power, Hong Tianliang was instantly sent flying, his fingers twisted.

“In the first place, my strength has already crushed you!

Ling Han’s mystical power was even stronger than Hong Tianliang’s, and under the boiling of his blood and Qi, his mystical power had increased threefold, further enlarging the gap in power between him and Hong Tianliang.

Thus, if Hong Tianliang fought him head-on, he would only be seeking his own suffering, or even seeking his own demise.

Peng! Hong Tianliang crashed to the ground, feeling his confidence also fall to rock bottom, shattering into pieces.

He was confident that he had cultivated a special technique that could sweep aside all Blood Transformation Tier elites, but in front of Ling Han, the seemingly invincible technique couldn’t even withstand a single blow.

“Thirdly, I think I still have to reserve it. There’s no need to use it on you,” Ling Han said calmly.

The third method was naturally Spiritual Power. The nine flying swords were now Ling Han’s trump card, capable of killing even Extreme Bone Tier elites, what more a Second Change Blood Transformation Tier.

Of course, strictly speaking, he still had a fourth trump card, and that was formation technique. In future, it would become Ling Han’s second trump card, and he would not reveal it now.

Hong Tianliang laughed tragically. He had never thought that he had suffered so much in the last few months, and almost died a few times, which allowed his abilities to improve greatly, but who would have thought that he was still inferior to Ling Han.

He didn’t care what Ling Han’s third method was. As he saw it, it should be a Spirit Tool. Being able to kill Extreme Bone Tier elites, it was naturally capable of suppressing him.

Actually, he also had a powerful Spirit Tool, but if he defeated Ling Han with the help of a Spirit Tool, it was impossible for him to recover his confidence. Moreover, Ling Han also had a Spirit Tool, so it wasn’t certain that he would win either.

He had lost, and lost again.

Hong Tianliang got up and walked back the way he came, his figure very bleak. Ling Han sighed. He really wanted to advise everyone not to treat him as a target to be surpassed and compared. Otherwise, they would only be beaten bloody and battered.

And in the outside world, similar exclamations of surprise arose.

This result was really beyond everyone’s expectations. Who would have thought that Ling Han would actually be so powerful? He had easily defeated Hong Tianliang.

“As expected of the second Hong Tianbu!”

“Do you guys think that Ling Han would be able to break through to the position of number one prodigy that Hong Tianbu holds in the future?” “This is absolutely impossible. Hong Tianbu is a freakish prodigy who can suppress the heavens. There is only one such prodigy in this world.” “That’s true. Ling Han has only defeated Hong Tianliang. He should still be too far away from that person.”

“To say nothing else, that person is already in the third level of Extreme Bone Tier. It’s said that his battle prowess is comparable to Inscription Tier. What kind of concept is that?”

“If he really encountered Hong Tianbu, he would be able to crush Ling Han with a single finger.”

Everyone reached a consensus, and that was there was absolutely no way that Ling Han would be able to match Hong Tianbu. He wouldn’t even be qualified to compare to the latter.

Ling Han found a blind spot in the surveillance, and entered into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. He had a good sleep, and while he was at it, absorbed the energy inside the gourd, improving his body in all aspects, especially spiritual power, which Ling Han now had high hopes for.

A night passed, and Ling Han exited the gourd. He didn’t cultivate. His mystical power had already reached the pinnacle of First Change. All he needed to do now was stabilize his cultivation level, and there was no further room for improvement.

He continued to search for Extreme Bone Tier Demonic Beasts. Although he was currently ranked first, without a continuous increase in credits, he would still be caught up by others.

Half a day later, he found the third Extreme Bone Tier great beast. This was a goat, but it had a single black horn. Its whole body was covered with long silver fur, and it looked very majestic.

Ling Han exchanged blows with it, yet he was defeated. He didn’t even have the chance to summon his flying sword before fleeing in a sorry state. He even boiled his blood and Qi.

The goat chased for a good few minutes, and only then did it give up. It turned around and went back the way it came.

F***, this goat was at least a Third Extreme. It was too powerful.

That black bear was a Second Extreme, and was already incredibly hard to kill. A Third Extreme would definitely be even harder to kill.

Just leave like that?

Ling Han shook his head. He had made a decision.

He would break through to Second Change.

After advancing into the Second Change, his strength would definitely increase. The changes to his mystical power and physical power would be very small. He had only unlocked the upper limit for further improvement, but his spiritual power would increase explosively.

Come on then. After these few battles, Ling Han also felt that his cultivation level was stable enough.

He found a blind spot in the surveillance, entered into the Essence Nurturing Gourd, and began to break through to the Second Change.

This was the elevation of the level of being. Ling Han discovered that there seemed to be countless chains in his body, and the elevation of his cultivation level tore through these chains, thereby achieving the leap in the level of being. He found a chain, and began to charge. Very soon, this chain was torn apart, but this was still not enough to complete the Second Change. Thus, he continued to tear off another chain.

Qiang, qiang, qiang! Loud sounds rang out from within his body, and the chains fell off, releasing his life energy, which rushed towards a higher level.

In this process, his life force force was also being expended rapidly. Ling Han hurriedly ingested the Vermillion Fruit to strengthen his life force, so he could maintain this kind of expenditure.

The chains continued to break free, and his level of being also continued to leap. Meanwhile, the number of Vermillion Fruits also continued to decrease. When Ling Han ingested seven Vermillion Fruits, his momentum finally slowed down.

Second Change.

Next, he would have to accumulate power for a very long time before he could unleash a burst of power, and continue to improve his level of being.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In terms of power, Ling Han’s power had improved slightly. This was only unlocking the upper limit, but his spiritual power had improved greatly. This was closely related to his level of being.

He exited the gourd, and began to experiment.

Xiu, the flying sword shot out at an incredibly fast speed.

“3.5 times the speed of sound!” Ling Han’s eyes lit up. Then, he threw it out with his hand again. Spiritual Power accelerated it, and this time, it reached 4.5 times the speed of sound.

Although its speed had only increased by 0.5 times the speed of sound, it was already very, very difficult to increase it by a dozen percent or so on the basis of such high speed.

“Let’s battle!”

Ling Han charged back in excitement. This time, he was definitely going to defeat that goat and roast it whole..
