Chapter 2363: You are?

Ling Han and the women returned, but the four of them very soon left their quarters together again.

Hu Niu, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou were about to break through.

In the remote wilderness of the mountains, the three women broke through respectively, while Ling Han continued to extract the Void Particle Energy from within that scroll, pushing his physical power further upwards.

A day later, the three women had completed their breakthrough one after another, and advanced into the Ascending Origin Tier. They were now one step closer to the Celestial King Tier.

They were in no rush to return. Ling Han had the three women continue attempting to absorb the energy inside the mysterious scroll, but they had not truly come into contact with the power of heaven and earth yet, and even with Wally’s “cultivation technique,” they still did not have the slightest idea how to go about it.

It was just like an artist that had never seen a tiger before. No matter how the tiger’s appearance was described to him, there was no way he could draw a life-like tiger.

Ling Han could only sigh in pity, but it was fine. As long as the three women could become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, there was still a chance that they could absorb the essence energy of the Genesis World, thus stepping into the ranks of Heavenly Venerates.

Both Hu Niu and the Empress would definitely become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, but it was not so certain for Bewitching Maiden Rou. However, Ling Han had no plans to turn her into their main contributor of battle prowess, either.

In a flash, 13 years had already passed. Ling Han continued to use Void Particle Energy to temper himself, already cultivating his Body Arts to the pinnacle of this cultivation level. According to Wally, his present Vitality Index was 4,424 points, already exceeding the Third Leaf of the Ninth Lotus by a great amount.

And after waiting for so many years, the commotion that rose up from kidnapping the human slaves finally quieted down. The two Ancestral Kings returned once more to their usual routines, and did not continue to stand guard day after day, night after night.

Ling Han found another chance.

When that sliver of divine sense of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity left once more, which he even confirmed with Wally, he immediately executed his operations.

This time, he was even stronger, so the speed at which he kidnapped them was naturally faster. After merely over an hour, he had taken all the humans into the Black Tower without alerting anyone. He returned casually.

However, when he had traveled halfway, he suddenly discovered a white figure had appeared ahead of him!

This was a person, but his features and even build could not be discerned at all. He was clearly just standing right there, so this was extremely bizarre.

He should be an elite.

Could it be that his previous actions had been witnessed by this person? Yet why had he waited here for Ling Han, then?

“Young man, you are very brave!” this figure said.

“I don’t know what you are talking about.” Ling Han’s heart steadied. As long as Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was not here, there was no one that could discover the Black Tower inside his body, so they naturally would not be able to catch him red-handed.

A thief had to be caught in the act. Ling Han could completely push the blame off of himself, and deny everything.

The white figure laughed loudly, and after laughing for a very long while, he finally said, “Young man, why have you kidnapped so many humans?”

Ling Han’s heart clenched, but he showed nothing in his expression as he replied, “I don’t know what nonsense you are blabbering!”

“I saw you take those humans into your Spatial God Tool with my very own ‘eyes.’ Don’t say that I saw wrong; that is impossible!” the white figure said.

Instantly, killing intent rose up in Ling Han’s heart. In the first place, he was enemies with the Foreign Realm. Since this person had discovered his secret, the only option was to kill him.

Xiu, Ling Han charged out, summoning the Divine Demon Sword directly. He delivered a sword strike, but it was soundless and negligible, not releasing the slightest bit of light, but accompanied by his astonishing physical power, it could unleash a terrifying destructive power.

The sword strike swept out, and Ling Han passed through the white figure. With how sharp the Divine Demon Sword was, it actually did not cause the slightest bit of damage.

“Yi, you are indeed a very lucky brat, to actually have gained a Celestial Tool!” The white figure appeared slightly surprised.

Yet Ling Han was even more stunned. The other party said “Celestial Tool,” and not “ancestral weapon.” What did this signify?

“Devouring Metal, right?” The white figure laughed. “This kind of Divine Metal has a strong ability to grow, and Divine Metal is not its strongest. In the future, it could be forged into a Heavenly Venerable Tier Tool.”

What astonishing insight!

Ling Han was shocked. Could it be that the precious Tools of Heavenly Venerates were all forged from Devouring Metal? Otherwise, “Please reading on N?WNOV?L.0?G”Divine Metal would be the final result; how would they find a material that was even stronger than Divine Metal?

“No need to be nervous, no need to be nervous. If I bore malicious intentions towards you, how could I possibly be speaking with you here?” The white figure laughed, and actually turned around to comfort Ling Han. However, his next words caused Ling Han to break out in a cold sweat. “You come from the Celestial Realm, right?”

Ling Han’s first reaction was to activate the Black Tower, and then flee immediately with the three women, but something instinctively told him that he should not be so rash.

Though this person’s features were hidden, he possessed an intimidatingly strong aura. If this kind of being had wanted to target him, he would not have given him the chance to activate the Black Tower at all. He would have long since attacked.

“Who are you, Senior?” Ling Han did not admit nor deny it.

The white figure laughed, and then sighed slowly as he said, “Like you, I, too, come from the Celestial Realm!”

Ling Han’s heart trembled as he asked, “Could it be that Senior is one of the earliest people to be brought into the Foreign Realm?”

“Something like that,” the white figure replied, his voice slightly bleak.

Ling Han was shocked. Then the other had surely been in the Foreign Realm for a considerable number of epochs by now; he had to have had a very difficult time.

“Tell me, brat, why have you come here?” the white figure asked.

Ling Han’s thoughts raced. There was definitely no way he could be so trusting. This person did not even show his face, and he was supposed to believe him? However, intuition told him that he should speak the truth.

Firstly, the other had indeed discerned his true identity, so there already would not be much meaning if Ling Han planned to deceive him by saying he was a guest from the Celestial Realm.

He considered for a moment, and only then related how he had been compelled by the Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm, and thus could only flee to the Foreign Realm.

After the white figure heard this, he sank into silence, and after a long while, he finally said, “Jiu Wu and Sealed Emotion, they are indeed still as cold and heartless as they had been. For the sake of their own transcendence, they have already abandoned everything.”

Ling Han’s heart throbbed wildly. Hearing the tone that the white figure spoke in, he seemed to be on the same level as Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

A Heavenly Venerate of the Celestial Realm?

He suddenly startled. This guy couldn’t be the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, right?

Everyone said that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had faced off against nine Heavenly Venerates on his own, resisting the nine Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm, and had even used his own body to crash into the connecting point of the two realms in his state of severe injury, granting peace to the Celestial Realm for a considerable number of epochs.

However, what if this guy had not died, and had even been captured and brought here by the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm?

No, no, if he was really the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, how could he stand here completely nonchalant like this?

“Dare I ask for Senior’s title?” Ling Han asked cautiously, though he was filled with anticipation. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hehe, a good many epochs ago, I did indeed have a title, and that was Wu Le.” The white figure laughed, but Ling Han could discern the bitterness in his laughter. After he finished laughing, he paused, and repeated, “Heavenly Venerate Wu Le!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered. This white figure was actually a Heavenly Venerate, and a Heavenly Venerate of the Celestial Realm at that?

This was completely illogical!

“Come, I will relate the exact details of the matter to you. I, too, need your help in this matter, or I would not have taken such a great risk to meet you,” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le said. “If you cannot accomplish this task, the Celestial Realm will really be done for.”
