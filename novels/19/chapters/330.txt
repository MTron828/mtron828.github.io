Ling Han was very freakish, but the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier was a shortcoming after all. His battle prowess could rival nine stars in the Spiritual Ocean Tier, but encountering the ten-starred purple-clothed youngster, he was still the side weaker by a level.

Within a few moves, he was at a disadvantage, only guarding.

However, this still stupefied Jian Ao Cheng and the purple-clothed youngster.

Since when could first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier’s be this ferocious?

In Jian Ao cheng’s eyes, killing intent was burning. If such a freak raised his cultivation to the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, wouldn’t he be able to instantly kill him? No, such a prodigy had to be quickly eradicated.

He liked to battle prodigies because the feeling of crushing prodigies was extremely pleasant—definitely not because he could lose.

The purple-clothed youngster roared repeatedly, one move more vicious than the previous, but Ling Han’s battle prowess was only weaker than him by one star; how could he possibly take Ling Han down by exerting a bit more strength? Besides, Ling Han still had too many trump cars that he hadn’t revealed.

If possible, Ling Han truly wanted to slaughter Ao Jian Cheng. He should be one of Ao Feng’s cherished children, and killing him would definitely make Ao Feng feel distressed for a while. However, Ling Han felt that a mental spirit always followed Ao Jian Cheng.

That formidable Winter Moon Sect’s cultivator was paying close attention to Ao Jian Cheng at every moment, and the instant Ling Han unleashed the Demon Birth Sword, it would definitely draw that person over.

Ling Han shook his head. He could only contend relying on his own strength.

“I underestimated you!” The purple-clothed youngster stopped, but did not to stop the battle. He took out a sword behind his back that gleamed like autumn water. On the blade were lines of fabric patterns, totaling nine; it was a Spirit Tool.

“Resuscitate!” He shouted lightly. Weng, weng, weng, the lines of fabric on the blade were activated one by one, glowing; however, only eight were lit up, the ninth line of fabric refusing to work.

“Making me use Long Brow Sword, you can feel proud even when you die!” The purple-clothed youngster smiled with air of arrogance, leaping out with his sword and slashing towards Ling Han. Hu , the Spirit Tool split apart the air and four flashes of Sword Qi danced all together, extremely scary.

Ling Han frowned momentarily, then just turned to run without saying another word.

If he wanted to beat the purple-clothed youngster, he had to use the Demon Birth Sword and the Mysterious Three Thousand. However, once the Demon Birth Sword was used, under the sensitivity of the Qi, the divine sense on Ao Jian Cheng would definitely realize.

That couldn’t happen!

Once he charged into the Spiritual Ocean Tier, his strength would have a shocking surge. Why was it necessary to fight desperately here?

“You want to run?” The purple-clothed youngster snorted, hurriedly breaking into pursuit.

Ao Jian Cheng displayed his movement technique and followed behind. Ling Han was too freakish—if such a prodigy wasn’t quickly eliminated, it simply would make him unable to rest or eat in peace.

However, who would be able to catch up to Ling Han who used Shadow Wind Movement Technique once he activated it?

Hu Niu was one, but for the Spiritual Ocean Tier practitioners, one had to be naturally gifted with movement techniques or have related bloodline abilities; otherwise, if they said they wanted to catch up to Ling Han who used the Shadow Wind Movement Technique, they didn’t really mean it.

However, after running for a few minutes, the difference between the two was pulled apart by a whole lot. Ao Jian Cheng took over the purple-clothed youngster, but the distance between them and Ling Han was still widening.

After chasing for a few more minutes, Ao Jian Cheng could only stop with disappointment, for Ling Han already disappeared from his field of vision.

He couldn’t help but harbor resentment; he should’ve personally attacked earlier, dealing Ling Han a fatal blow and giving him no chance to escape! But who would’ve thought that he who was in the first layer of the Gushing Spring Tier not only had nature-defying battle prowess, but also speed that could make others gape.

...He hadn’t witnessed Hu Niu’s speed, or else he’d definitely suffer a mental breakdown.

“Senior Brother Jian Cheng, did you kill...” The purple-clothed youngster arrived, and thought to ask Ao Jian Cheng whether he’d killed Ling Han, but as soon as he spoke, he knew something was off; Ao Jian Cheng’s expression was quite unsightly.

“Hmph!” Ao Jian Cheng’s expression was full of killing intent. He swore he definitely wouldn’t let Ling Han off the next time.

***

After Ling Han ran for a while, his figure flashed and entered the Black Tower.

It was time to break through.

Once he stepped into the Spiritual Ocean Tier, he’d sweep across the desolate lands. So what if there was someone in the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, he couldn’t destroy them without using the Demon Birth Sword.

The Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf was still alive, but heavily injured. It woke up and immediately bared its teeth, roaring angrily and revealing its viciousness.

“Still vicious?” Ling Han hurled a slap and the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf was instantly shocked to death. He waved his hand, and the beast wolf’s blood was completely extracted, adhering to his body.

Several drops of blood were actually silver, as if mercury condensed into a ball.

This was Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf’s blood essence, and the sign of a king; there were only a few drops. Don’t be bitter about the small amount—only after reaching the Shattering Void Tier would one’s blood turn fully silver, and flinging one drop of it could kill someone in the Flower Blossom Tier.

Ling Han absorbed the essence, turning it into vigor that nourished his body.

The blood was drying up at a rapid pace, turning into a scab stuck on his skin. The color of it was extremely light as the essence within had all been absorbed.

Ling Han felt like his body was going to burst. Absorbing the blood essence of a beast king at the Spiritual Ocean Tier was greatly beneficial to him.

However, this wasn’t enough!

Ling Han waved his hand again; the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf instantly broke into parts, each bone separated, fluttering midair. One drop of white bone marrow immediately emerged from the bone.

Blood and bone marrow were the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf’s true essence.

Normally, the bones needed to be continuously boiled and simmered for at least a day and a night before the bone marrow could become soup; however, inside the Black Tower, there was no need for such trouble. Ling Han only had to raise his hand to do it.

He opened his mouth. Xiu, xiu, xiu, the bone marrow’s essence instantly flew into his mouth and was swallowed by him.

Weng , the Five Elements Chaos Lotus vibrated slightly as Origin Power flowed violently inside, sending the bone marrow’s essence to every corner of his body and strengthening his bones and muscles.

“More spirit medicine!” Ling Han waved his hand; stalk after stalk of spirit medicine was pulled from the ground, lining up in front of him.

He chose some spirit medicine that strengthened his physique and compacted his origin from the spirit medicines he harvested at the Devil Sky Mystery Realm and the Winter Moon Sect’s medicinal garden. He pressed with his right hand and the liquid medicinal essence was instantly extracted.

Ling Han opened his mouth and swallowed like a whale.

Hong , his entire being was like it turned into a pill furnace. Inside his body were several types of spirit medicine and the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf’s bone marrow and blood. He turned his body into a pill furnace, refining these essences and nourishing his body.

He felt as if he would soon explode.

‘It wasn’t enough, it hadn’t reached the limit,’ Ling Han thought to himself. He would break through at the instant his body reached the limit, compacting his fundamentals to an unshakable degree.

Hong, hong, hong , wave after wave of energy detonated inside Ling Han’s body. His skin cracked and streams of blood poured out, but his eyes were still shining; he almost touched the door of the extreme.

Pa, pa, pa, his skin continued to crack open. Even the Rock Cliff Body couldn’t tolerate the violent energy wreaking havoc inside his body.

At this moment...!
