2857 Three raw stones

There was treasure in this raw stone, but… it was actually an earthworm!

Really, this raw stone was only the size of a fist and completely red in color. It was covered with a dense network of veins laid out in a pattern.

Was this considered a primitive beast?

Ling Han rubbed his chin. Would this eventually become an Earthworm Heavenly Venerate in the future?

After some thought, he still picked up this raw stone. A raw stone that contained a primitive beast was extremely rare. Even if it was not for the sake of this gamble, he was also interested to play around with it.

In any case, he had already glanced through all the raw stones here, so it was definite that he could win.

A day later, the two of them had chosen their three raw stones.

“I will open them myself,” Bao Fengyu said. He preferred to personally open his own stones—the scene of cheers from all the people around him when precious treasures were revealed excited him greatly.

Ling Han did not mind either way, and he said to the stonecutter next to him, “You help me open.”

“Yes, Milord.” The stonecutter hurriedly nodded. He was only the equivalent of Ascending Origin Tier. In front of a Heavenly Venerate, he was an existence that could not be any more negligible.

“Open this one first.” Ling Han pointed at that raw stone that contained a blue-colored Great Herb.

The stonecutter started, and Bao Fengyu started moving as well.

Though raw stones were not very hard, it was also a task of labor for an Ascending Origin Tier. Hence, the stonecutter was moving very slowly, while Bao Fengyu’s movements were fast. Layer after layer of stone was scraped off, and a hint of blue was revealed very soon.

“Is it Divine Metal?” someone asked. If it was Divine Metal, then it would be worthless.

“It’s not Divine Metal; it’s a Great Herb!” Someone’s eyes immediately focused.

Bao Fengyu showed a hint of pride, and sliced a few more times. As expected, the shape of a herb could just be vaguely seen.

“That really is a Great Herb.”

“It has to be admitted that he does indeed have some skills; he is worthy of being called a grandmaster.”

“He is Niu Buqun’s senior brother, after all, the most senior disciple of Grandmaster Xuanlai.”

Everyone was musing ruefully. Bao Fengyu might be proud, but he did have the right to be. At least he could enjoy outstanding social status and become a respected guest of Heavenly Venerates in this dimension before the raw stones were completely mined.

Very quickly, this Great Herb was unearthed, and it was completely blue in color.

“Though it is only blue in color, it is still impressive.” Everyone shook their head. Some wanted to offer bids, yet they were convinced by others not to. That was because this was stone gambling. Before this ended, who knew whom this Great Herb would ultimately belong to.

The stonecutter was much slower, and he had only just scraped off the outermost layer of stone after quite a while.

“Yi, there’s treasure here as well,” someone called out.

“That’s very normal. This is the high-grade area. The chances of encountering treasure are very high, but most of the time, it is actually still Divine Metal.” Someone beside him shook his head.

“True.” The person from before no longer thought this was anything strange, and decided to just wait and see.

Everyone was watching them, and even if Bao Fengyu’s expression was filled with pride and nonchalance, he stopped his movements, and directed his attention to the other side. And Niu Buqun even stretched out his neck to look. He really could not afford to lose.

“Green?”

“Is it green-colored Divine Metal?”

“Or a green-colored Great Herb?”

Everyone could confirm that this was definitely not a Heavenly Venerable Seal, but whether it was Divine Metal, a Great Herb, or a primitive beast, it still could not be distinguished yet.

Cut, cut, cut. That stonecutter sliced carefully, and scraped off layer after layer of stone, revealing even more of the contents.

“It is a Great Herb!”

“It is a green-colored Great Herb!”

“Heavens!”

Everyone exclaimed in surprise; this really was coincidental. Bao Fengyu had just unearthed a Great Herb, and Ling Han did as well. Furthermore, there was no need to compare the two. Green was better than blue, and this was something that everyone knew very well.

In the first round, it was Ling Han’s victory.

Bao Fengyu’s expression was slightly livid, but he was not too concerned. He had deliberately decided this sequence of stonecutting, and the objects that would be unearthed from the remaining two… would be even better.

He did not say anything, and continued his stonecutting.

Very quickly, enough of the stone had been scraped off, revealing yet another color that was not grayish white.

“It is a green-colored Great Herb!” someone exclaimed.

Bao Fengyu was proud of himself. Did everyone think that he could not pick out any treasures?

Ling Han merely smiled, and as the stonecutter slowly and carefully did his work, a color that was not grayish white was also revealed here.

“Green!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yi, it can’t be, right?”

Everyone faltered. Just now, Bao Fengyu had unearthed a blue-colored Great Herb, and Ling Han had immediately countered with a green-colored Great Herb, which was just slightly better. Now, Bao Fengyu had unearthed a green-colored Great Herb, yet it was possible that Ling Han had unearthed a hint of green, which meant that his odds were still slightly better.

Could it be so coincidental twice?

No, no, no, how could there be so many coincidences in this world?

But if Ling Han had deliberately arranged the sequence like this, that would have been even more frightening. This meant that not only did Ling Han know the raw stones that he had chosen like the back of his hand, he was also very aware of his opponent’s cards as well.

But was that possible?

These were raw stones, and even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates could not possibly see through them.

Everyone was staring intently, wanting nothing more than to kick that stonecutter aside. ‘You are too f*cking slow!’

“I’ll do it!” A Heavenly Venerate could no longer hold back. Scrambling forwards, he pushed the stonecutter aside, directly using his hand like a blade to slice through the stone.

The power of Heavenly Venerable Tier was naturally sharper than Divine Metal, and this was the hand of a Heavenly Venerate at that, so he naturally could control it at will. Very quickly, a green-colored Great Herb appeared.

...

“It really is!” Everyone couldn’t help but wear a strange expression.

This had been deliberate; this was definitely deliberate.

“Yi!” The Heavenly Venerate that had opened the stone showed a hint of surprise. “This is not a Great Herb for improving cultivation level!”

“Ah?” Everyone gasped again. Then what was it?

Bao Fengyu and Niu Buqun both sighed in relief. Were they about to reverse their situation now?

“This is a saintly medicine for healing injuries, which is even rarer!” that Heavenly Venerate said.

“What?” Instantly, many people’s eyes became bloodshot.

Though Heavenly Venerates were said to be respected by even the heavens, in truth, their existence was not condoned by the heaven and earth. Hence, when a Heavenly Venerate suffered injuries, they had to heal their own injuries. No medicine would be effective, because Heavenly Venerates had surpassed Regulations, so how could medicines that were still within the range of Regulations be effective?

But in this separated dimension, celestial medicines had wilted who knew how many years ago, yet had been mysteriously sealed in stones, absorbing the fundamental powers of the Genesis World for countless years, which allowed them to be capable of advancing the cultivation level of cultivators.

And the even rarer Great Herbs could heal the injuries sustained by a Heavenly Venerate.

It was true that Heavenly Venerates could recover injuries automatically, but what time would they have for self-recovery in battle? Thus, the value of this kind of Great Herb was amazing, superior to that of other green-colored Great Herbs.

...

That Heavenly Venerate reluctantly handed this Great Herb to Ling Han, and couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Ling, would you mind parting with a leaf?”

Ling Han smiled. “Let’s talk about this later.”

That Heavenly Venerate nodded. The competition had not yet ended. He was too anxious.

“Senior Brother, what should we do?” Niu Buqun looked towards Bao Fengyu, so nervous that cold sweat was dripping down his forehead.

Bao Fengyu’s expression was livid, and he exclaimed, “What is the rush? There is still the last piece!” He did not believe that Ling Han’s third raw stone would still be able to surpass his. He definitely would be turning the tables on Ling Han.

He moved, and began to cut into the last raw stone.

Bao Fengyu was filled with confidence. The third raw stone would definitely reveal some extremely rare treasure. His insight would definitely not be mistaken.

However, as white stone scraps flew, the stone continuously shrank in size, but not a single bit of thing was revealed.

Finally, this was proven to be a scrap stone.

Bao Fengyu’s mouth was half-gaping, his expression extremely complicated and very hilarious.
