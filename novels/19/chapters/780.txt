Chapter 781: Show of Strength

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Shortly, several powerful figures appeared, and although they retracted their powerful presence, they still revealed silhouettes of sun, moon, and stars as their eyes opened and closed—terrifyingly shocking.

They were definitely Shattering Void Tier powerhouses.

“Xun Xue!” the man in the middle said. Wearing a multi-colored embroidered robe, he was tall and well-built, with two small buns on his head that looked as if horns that were about to grow out. It was an obvious characteristic of a dragon’s descendant, but not everyone was like this. For example, Helian Xun Xue, who didn’t have any defined dragon race’s characteristics, but her bloodline was considerably pure and strong.

“My respects to the king!” Helian Xun Xue bowed. Not to mention that the other party was Helian family’s chief and her father, the Shattering Void Tier alone commanded respect. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han pondered, and said, “I am Ling Han, respects to the north sea Helian family’s seniors!”

The Helian Family didn’t clearly express whether they accepted him as a son-in-law, so Ling Han obviously wasn’t willing to be enthusiastic to a cold crowd, but intended on taking things step by step instead. You guys were the one who invited me to come, so release a friendly signal.

“Hmph!” Except for Helian Rong, the other five people glanced at Ling Han, revealing displeased looks.

It was this man who destroyed Helian and Xianyu’s cooperative relationship—he truly deserved to be killed!

Helian Rong nodded, and said, “Let’s talk after we enter the room.”

The six people turned, while Helian Xun Xue signaled at Ling Han with her eyes, and followed behind them.

Ling Han pulled on Hu Niu’s hand and walked forward while saying in low voice, “Would your father lure us in and then lock up and beat us?”

Although his voice was low, Helian Rong and the other five were powerful, and couldn’t possibly not hear it; their faces twitched, and they had an urge to give Ling Han a sound thrashing.

Helian Xun Xue also appeared awkward, glaring at Ling Han. This guy was actually still fooling around... If she didn’t have a son with him, she really wanted to give him a fierce whipping.

The group walked into a hall, where many people were already seated; many more people were still on their way, young and old. The seniors had seats, while the juniors could only stand in the surrounding, but there were also exceptions—a few youngsters full of martial spirit received seats that were quite near the front.

They should be the leading figures of Helian family’s next generation if they could qualify to be bestowed with a seat.

Ling Han took a glance. The majority of these youngsters were in the Deity Transformation Tier, but there were two that advanced into the Heaven Tier but were somewhat older. It couldn’t be discerned from their looks, but judging from their Qi and blood, they should be forty to fifty years old—it couldn’t be judged very accurately.

“Xun Xue, you ran from the marriage without permission, do you know your crimes?” an old man suddenly opened up with an intense interrogative tone, his voice rumbling.

A show of strength?

Ling Han came out boldly with a smile, and said, “Everybody, this time, we, husband and wife, accepted the invitation and came to the sea race, to discuss the matter of the settling, so why suddenly mention Xun Xue? If that’s the case, we can only turn around and leave.”

“Outrageous human, you dare to be impudent in front of this old man!” the old man shouted furiously. He was a Shattering Void Tier elite, and with his fury, his aura rippled and instantly made many people feel oppression in their chests; even their flesh was about to rupture.

Ling Han was unafraid. When he and Helian Xun Xue rushed here, Helian Rong and the other five Shattering Void Tier elites personally greeted them, and although Helian Rong didn’t say any words of welcome, it was a sort of declaration of position, a considerably high standard and treatment.

Thus, it could be thought of as them playing good cop bad cop, white and black. They were showing good will previously, and now someone was playing bad cop, giving Ling Han a show of strength... if Ling Han didn’t come out boldly, he would obviously be looked down upon. Seeing his own wife being reprimanded and refusing to confront it, what good was there keeping such a man?

Ling Han said indifferently, “If Helian royal family does not welcome us, then we’ll just leave.”

“Coming here, you think you can leave just because you say you will?” another Shattering Void Tier powerhouse spoke up. He looked only forty, his figure surprisingly stalwart, and his height reaching over three meters; he looked like a small mountain standing there—shockingly oppressive.

Ling Han swept a glance at him, and said, “Oh, you want to stop us? Come, attack, let me see the powerfulness of the sea race!”

If he kept yielding, then he would only let the Helian Clan think he was easy to bully, and in the following negotiations, he would only be at an absolute disadvantage. So, he also wanted a fight to give Helian Family a show of strength.

“Haha, you want to challenge this general?” That giant couldn’t help but laugh. It was definitely the best and most arrogant joke he had ever heard—a mere Deity Transformation Tier dared to challenge a Shattering Void Tier elite.

“You don’t dare? If you don’t dare to, then don’t be pesky, it’s not like you’re one who has the right to make decisions!” Ling Han said coldly.

F*ck, this brat’s too arrogant!

Many people were in a violent rage. In their eyes, the human race represented “weakness,” and now the weak dared to provoke the strong, obviously making them both surprised and infuriated.

Too detestable.

That giant wasn’t from Helian royal family, but he was one of the king’s seven generals, surnamed Yu. Xuanyu was also a large family, a clan that adhered to the Helian royal family, and the strongest elite in the clan was Yu Jianshan, with cultivation of the third layer of the Shattering Void Tier.

Helian royal family had a little over thirty Shattering Void Tiers, which included these adhering forces, and in Helian Family’s alone, there were roughly twenty Shattering Void Tier elites, which was also an extremely surprising thing.

Before coming here, Helian Xun Xue already analyzed the various great forces of the sea race, so Ling Han didn’t lack understanding of them. The reason why Helian royal family could have so many Shattering Void Tier elites was because of the existence of ancestral blood, making it relatively easier to advance to this tier. Secondly, they were descendants of the dragon race and had longer lifespan, living three times longer compared to the human race at any tier.

The possibility of breaking through was obviously a little higher with more time, especially three times the time, which could create endless possibilities.

Besides, human Shattering Void Tier elites only had roughly one thousand years of lifespan, but the sea race’s royal family reached up to four thousand years. With three more generations of accumulation, how could there not be lots of Shattering Void Tier powerhouses?

“Haha, human junior, if you can take one of this general’s move, this general will allow you to talk!” Yu Jianshan laughed from extreme anger.

The other people didn’t speak and tacitly approved of Yu Jianshan’s method, which clearly was to give Ling Han a hard time. Of course, they also wouldn’t do too much to Ling Han. Firstly, they indeed wanted to confirm the truth about the settling, and secondly, they suffered enough at the hands of Yi Shuang Shuang, so they wouldn’t dare be too unbridled, either.

“Third Ancestor, there’s no need for you to personally attack, allow me!” A man who was also stalwart jumped out, pointed at Ling Han, and said, “I am Xuanyu family’s Yu Zihe. Human, await your death!”

Seeing Yu Zihe jump out, some of Helian Family’s people instantly frowned.

Shattering Void Tier elites knew more or less about the settling and knew the purpose of inviting Ling Han over, so no matter how furious they were, they’d attack with proper restraint. However, the settling involved too much, and they didn’t dare let the juniors know. Any leaks... could incur the calamity of the clan’s destruction!

Yu Zihe was part of the masses that didn’t know the truth, and although he was only in the Deity Transformation Tier, he reached the ninth layer and his battle prowess was terrifying, comparable to low-level Heaven Tier. If he accidently beat Ling Han to death, the matter would also be grave.
