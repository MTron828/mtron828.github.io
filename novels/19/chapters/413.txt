Chapter 414: Primal Chaos Source Rock

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Great, now it was even livelier with all sorts of demons and beasts showing up.

“Dreg of Thousand Corpse Sect, how dare you to come here, you court death!” A Flower Blossom Tier elite attacked, swatting at Rong Huan Xuan.

Everyone had the right to execute a disciple of such an evil sect no matter how high or low; even if Rong Huan Xuan had the title of an alchemist, it would be the same. It could be inferred just how despised and resented the Thousand Corpse Sect was. Even after a millennium, the sight of this sect still gave people the urge to kill.

“Gagaga, want to kill this lord? You’re still ten millennia too early!” Rong Huan Xuan laughed loudly, but he only paid lip service as he immediately wormed into Three Lives Corpse Casket.

His main body was certainly undying but his flesh was too fragile, only at the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier; he couldn’t possibly resist a Flower Blossom Tier warrior’s attacks.

Weng! Weng! Weng!

The attacks landed on the Three Lives Corpse Casket, and instantly, this Spirit Tool was activated. Vein-like lines shined as if the entire casket was coming to life. Shua , a pillar of light surged out and turned into a skeleton soldier with a pike in hand, thrusting towards the Flower Blossom Tier elite.

Pu , with a spear thrust, the Flower Blossom Tier’s left shoulder was penetrated!

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned.

That was a Flower Blossom Tier warrior, but he couldn’t even block an attack. If he hadn’t evaded in time, his heart might’ve been shocked. It was too terrifying... what sort of treasure was that, being able to suppress even Flower Blossom Tier opponents?

However, some people looked towards Ling Han with strange gazes, because Ling Han also struck it once earlier—why did nothing happen at all?

The sword in the youngster’s hand... could it actually be a high tier Spirit Tool?

Ling Han also gasped in surprise inwardly. Both were tenth tier Spirit Tools, but Three Lives Corpse Casket was too kickass. Hiding inside the casket, one would not only have invincible defense, but also have thorns attached to oneself—whoever hit it would be out of luck.

More importantly, Three Lives Corpse Casket could also move on its own like a carriage, it was very convenient.

However, If Ling Han was made to hide in a casket... he definitely wouldn’t do it.

“Three Lives Corpse Casket! That’s Three Lives Corpse Casket!” Elder Nine Clouds’ eyes brightened up. Thousand Corpse Sect had three priceless treasures, which were the Demonic Noise Saber, the Pond of the Underworld, and... the Three Lives Corpse Casket!

However, the Pond of the Underworld wasn’t a Spirit Tool, but an inherited land of Thousand Corpse Sect. It was also a holy place for cultivation—cultivating inside for a year could equal one year on the outside. But its location was unknown since several millennia ago.

Today, the Demonic Noise Saber was grasped by the current sect master. Followed by the appearance of the Three Lives Corpse Casket, it meant two out of three prized treasure appeared—was appearance of the Pond of the Underworld still something distant?

Was the Thousand Corpse Sect going to prosper?

Elder Nine Clouds was mad with excitement. If he could obtain the Spirit Tool that could accommodate living things from Ling Han, the Thousand Corpse Sect could enter its golden age, even surpassing the dynasty several millennia ago.

Rong Hua Xuan laughed eerily­ and said, “This lord won’t play with you guys anymore. Once this lord obtains the Primal Chaos Source Stone and refines it as this lord’s body, the entire world will tremble under this lord’s clutches!”

Primal Chaos Source Stone? Was it the black stone?

The question flashed across Ling Han’s mind as he attacked unhesitatingly once again. He definitely wouldn’t allow Asura Demon Emperor to obtain the black stone. The Thousand Corpse Sect could still be suppressed no matter how strong they were, but Asura Demon Emperor? That was a god spirit, and once his battle prowess fully recovered, the vast lands would face calamity.

“Insolent boy, when this lord’s cultivation is recovered, this lord will kill you first!” Rong Huan Xuan yelled angrily, steering the Three Lives Corpse Casket and charging into the Demonic Qi.

No one dared to stop him as the misfortune of the Flower Blossom Tier earlier was still in front of them and no one wanted to share the same fate.

Ling Han chased swiftly after, and Hu Niu naturally charged into the Demonic Qi as well. The two instantly disappeared from everyone’s sight. The Demonic Qi was not only dense enough to block vision, but also had a strong effect of cutting off divine sense; consequently, even Flower Blossom Tiers immediately lost the trace of the three people.

At this moment, everyone only thought of two words: damned idiot!

That was Demonic Qi; couldn’t it be seen that even Flower Blossom Tier elites weren’t willing to be contaminated? What were a few small Spiritual Ocean Tier and Gushing Spring Tier warriors trying to do by running into it?

The Flower Blossom Tiers carried out a fierce battle again, unleashing their attacks at the demonic ape—these were separate matters.

“Boy, don’t think that this lord will fear you just because your tier is higher than this lord’s!” Rong Huan Xuan’s voice came from within the casket. He was only at the ninth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier and couldn’t possibly rival Ling Han. “When this lord refines some primal chaos Demonic Qi and increases in cultivation, retrieving the Primal Chaos Source Rock, your life will be taken as blood sacrifice for this lord’s rebirth!”

“Oh, that Primal Chaos Source Rock or whatever can make you stronger?” Ling Han said indifferently.

Rong Huan Xuan snorted and said,” This lord transformed from a sliver of the world’s primal chaos Demonic Qi and suffered for not having flesh, which was why this lord was suppressed for several millennia and split into nine parts. However, Primal Chaos Source Rock and this lord are of the same source as one of the world’s toughest matter. This lord only has to refine it into a body—who in the world would be able to rival this lord then? Haha, when the time comes, this lord’s flesh will be invincible, equipped with overwhelming demonic psychic powers! All will become this lord’s slaves!”

This old monster was so honest all of a sudden, even revealing his trump card. Thinking again, he actually didn’t reveal any secrets, saying only where he came from but not how to annihilate him.

No wonder that several millennia ago, his body could only be dismembered then suppressed; he wasn’t a living thing in the true sense, but rather a manifestation of Demonic Qi.

Rong Huan Xuan didn’t simply boast, as he was in the process of absorbing the Demonic Qi. Weng, weng, weng, the presence he emitted was strengthening; although it was still at the Gushing Spring Tier, it could clearly be sensed that his tier was improving extremely quickly.

Ling Han sighed... why did he always encountered monsters?

Ideas flashed across his mind; with the protection of the Three Lives Corpse Casket, he definitely wouldn’t be able to stop Rong Huan Xuan’s tier increase. However, where did the Demonic Qi in this land come from? There was definitely a black stone that released the Demonic Qi, but it was suppressed by the large mountain and could only spread through the ground into the forest. Now, it was as if it turned into an ocean.

If he retrieved the black stone, or the Primal Chaos Source Rock in Rong Huan Xuan’s words, then everything could be taken care of.

Ling Han decided on spot and pulled on Hu Niu to leave, beginning to search for the land where the Demonic Qi originated.

He asked Small Tower about Primal Chaos Source Rock and Demonic Qi. Small Tower unexpectedly knew the relationship between the two, telling him several secrets—if Asura Demon Emperor really absorbed the Primal Chaos Source Rock, then he at least wouldn’t be killed on those vast lands as Primal Chaos Source Rock was too hard.

However, this didn’t seem to make a difference. Asura Demon Emperor was originally a ball of Demonic Qi, but couldn’t he still cause disasters for millennia even after being split into nine parts?

Demonic Qi was like the vast ocean. Ling Han’s divine sense couldn’t be spread out and black spots already began to appear on his body. The divine sense was the same, no longer clear as water, but instead filled with violent impulses.

In contrast, Hu Niu was perfectly fine, but an indistinct light appeared in her dantian, as if a vein-like pattern had been lit up. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The little girl was much more freakish than he was.

He flashed into the Black Tower and immediately summoned the power of the Black Tower to dispel the Demonic Qi in his body. His skin returned quickly to normal at a visible speed and his divine sense opened up, clear and immaculate.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower again. With the experience of resisting the black stone, he could survive for several minutes even within such dense Demonic Qi.

“Niu Niu, lets’ race to see who can find a rock like this.” Ling Han smiled at Hu NIu as he dangled a small black stone in his hand.

“Okay!” Hu Niu immediately said in a crisp voice, appearing very excited as she shot out. “If Niu wins, Niu wants to eat three roasted chicken drumsticks!”
