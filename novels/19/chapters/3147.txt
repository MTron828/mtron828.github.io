3148 Dark North Nation

Ling Han looked at these nine people, and asked, “Have you all suffered like that before?”

“Sigh!” The Twelve Meridians king tiers all sighed.

“Who would not times when they had misbehaved?” a large man in green said.

It was no wonder that when these people had followed Lian Xuerong off the battle ship, they were all as obedient as children. As it turned out, they had all been harshly taught a lesson, leaving behind a strong psychological scar on them.

He really couldn’t tell that this aloof woman had a side to her that was as beautiful as peach flowers?

“Additionally, welcome, brother, to join our Xuanqing Banner.” Wang Feng opened his arms to Ling Han and hugged him tightly.

The others all stepped forward to embrace Ling Han. They then introduced themselves.

These people were actually very simple and sincere, causing Ling Han to slowly change his mindset. Originally, he had hated these people very much.

As for Sima Rong, he was in a miserable state. Though Lian Xuerong didn’t reprimand him, everyone knew that their Banner Lord hated being deceived the most. She didn’t flare up now because Lian Xuerong held Sun Jianfang in high regard and could not spare the time to punish him now.

In the first place, the warriors all looked down on boot-lickers like Sima Rong. Naturally, no one wanted to plead on his behalf. They only treated him as empty air, just passing him by, and did not even cast a second look at him.

Sima Rong was despondent. He had been assigned a mission when he returned to Blue Feather City this time, acting as a pawn and scout, mainly to find out about the outstanding talents of the various forces. And what happened in the end? There was obviously a super genius like Ling Han, but because of his jealousy, he had almost been buried.

How could Lian Xuerong spare him?

Flee.

He thought to himself that nothing good would happen if he stayed, and he was already a king tier of Ten Meridians, so where couldn’t he go?

However, just as he was about to descend the mountain, he saw the bald man block his path with a grin, “Where do you think you’re going?”

This was an elite of Twelve Meridians!

Sima Rong flopped onto the ground. He couldn’t run away even if he wanted to, so he could only wait for punishment in fear.

Ling Han didn’t immediately dive into the pool. The water was still filled with strong poison, and even a Ten Meridians Demonic Beast couldn’t withstand it. If he jumped in like this, it was very likely that he wouldn’t be able to come out again.

It would be better to wait. In any case, the battle ship would only be started a month later, and return to Huju City.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Ling Han asked Wang Feng and the others for guidance, and gained a good understanding of the Dark North Nation.

The Dark North Nation originated from the extreme north of the Celestial Sea Planet. After the drastic changes in heaven and earth, it rapidly rose up, and soon swept aside all opposition, continuously expanding its territory.

Why was the Ancient Dao Sect completely unaware of the existence of such a colossal force?

It was very simple, because after the great change of heaven and earth, the wilderness was filled with Demonic Beasts, and the communication devices were also broken. People could not walk too far, and what they knew and heard was limited. It was only now that the expansion of the Dark North Nation had reached them that they suddenly realized that there was actually such an incomparably powerful force outside.

The Emperor of the Dark North Nation was surnamed Chen, but no one knew his name. This was an honorific, and ordinary people were not qualified to know. And what cultivation level the Emperor of the Dark North Nation was at was even more unknown.

In any case, he was the number one elite of the Dark North Nation, and it was highly possible that he was also the number one elite of the Celestial Sea Planet.

Wang Feng and the others actually didn’t know much either. They were only in their thirties now, and had been born and grew up in Huju City. Afterwards, they practiced martial arts, and joined the army in order to get by. Afterwards, after a lot of screening, they finally joined the Xuanqing Banner.

There were about 10,000 people in the ordinary army of Huju City, and the most outstanding people would be chosen to join the special teams of Xuanqing, Dihuang, Tianhuo and Yunmo.

Any one member of these teams would be a king tier of Ten Meridians.

Their mission was basically to eliminate the Demonic Beasts within the borders of the nation. This kind of recruitment mission was only done occasionally, and was not much different from a holiday to them.

Sun Jianfang soon came out, his face filled with excitement.

He called Ling Han over, and seriously advised Ling Han to let go of everything that belonged to the Ancient Dao Sect. Compared to the greatness of the Dark North Nation, it really wasn’t worth mentioning.

The old geezer’s attitude changed so quickly?

Ling Han, on the other hand, didn’t care much. He had only entered the Ancient Dao Sect for a few months, so it was naturally impossible for him to have any sense of belonging. He only thought that Sun Jianfang was worthy of respect, considered Nie Yang a friend and gained a little maid.

Previously, he had asked Nie Yang for a favor. When he returned, he would inform Huan Xue that she would come over with the soldier that was heading to the Ancient Dao Sect.

After staying for a few days, the poison in the pool finally dissipated. Ling Han leaped into the pool to see if the Volcanic Fruit had ripened.

The moment he fell into the water, he immediately shivered. It was really cold, almost freezing his blood.

He hurriedly channelled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique. Instantly, a heat circulated in his body, dispelling a portion of the coldness.

It was still very cold, but it was finally tolerable.

He dived to the bottom of the pool, and the water pressure rapidly increased. Thankfully, the Volcanic Fruit was growing on the cave wall that was about 30 meters deep in the pool. The water pressure at this position was nothing to Ling Han.

It hadn’t matured completely yet, and it would probably take another five days.

Then let’s just wait.

Ling Han floated to the surface. Huala, water splashed in all directions. He suddenly discovered that even Lian Xuerong was actually at the side of the pool, and this liquid instantly sprayed towards her.

Weng, this beauty raised her hand, and instantly, an invisible wall formed around her, blocking the liquid.

“Apologies, I didn’t see Banner Lord,” Ling Han said apologetically.

Lian Xuerong was not an unreasonable person. She was not angered, but rather threw out a book, and said, “This is a cultivation technique created by His Imperial Majesty, the Xuanhuang Technique. I will now bestow you with the opportunity to cultivate this technique. If there is anything you do not understand, you can come and find me at any time.”

Sure enough, “proper” forces all had cultivation techniques. Otherwise, relying on fist techniques to absorb the mystical power of heaven and earth was really too inefficient.

Ling Han accepted the cultivation technique, and Lian Xuerong turned around and left.

Sima Rong knelt at the side, so jealous that flames were about to burst from his eyes.

He had travelled the world a few years ago, and coincidentally, when he was battling fiercely with a Demonic Beast, he was rescued by Lian Xuerong’s team. He stayed with this team for a period of time, and received some benefits, which allowed him to advance into Ten Meridians.

Afterwards, he was ordered by Lian Xuerong to return to carry out his mission.

However, after so long, he had never been taught any cultivation technique.

This damn brat stole everything from him!

Sima Rong gritted his teeth. He had been punished to kneel here for a month, but ten days had not even passed, and he already felt like he could not hold on any longer.

If looks could kill, then Ling Han would definitely have been killed by him many times over. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han cast a glance at Sima Rong, but was completely unconcerned. He followed her, and said, “Banner Lord —”

“What is it?” Lian Xuerong stopped in her tracks, a sliver of coldness in their eyes. If Ling Han pushed his luck and made some unreasonable demands, then she would teach Ling Han a good lesson.

“Does Banner Lord possess any information about formations?” Ling Han asked.
