Chapter 1244: Invincible Sword Might

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

For Sun Moon Tier forces like the Heaven’s Sword Sect, their strongest beings would only be at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, those who were at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier were also integral members of the sect. In fact, they could even be regarded as the pillars of the sect.

Now, however, they had been killed as if they were mere ants. Countless millennia’s worth of training and resources had disappeared in a flash.

The elder had a reason to be furious. He opened his hands, and three Suns and two Moons materialized behind him, radiating with a boundless murderous aura.

He was at the middle stage of the high extreme.

Peng!

Ling Han replied with a fist, yet he was instantly sent flying. There was a difference of two stars between them, and it was truly too great to overcome. A cloud of blood erupted from his body. Luckily, his Godly bones were strong enough, and wouldn’t be broken so easily.

“Good one, brat!” There was a look of immense shock on the elder’s face as he stared at Ling Han.

He was two minor levels above Ling Han. Theoretically speaking, this was a difference of eight stars. Ling Han should have definitely been insta-killed by him. However, although Ling Han was no match for him in terms of power, he was merely injured, and not killed. In fact, his injuries weren’t even severe.

How could he accept this?

“No matter how strong you are, you still won’t escape death today!” the elder said coldly. He had an overwhelming advantage over Ling Han. Thus, even if he couldn’t insta-kill him, he could still kill him if he landed a few more blows on him.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I don’t see why not!” He retrieved an Explosive Thunder Pill and tossed it into his mouth.

Pa, pa, pa!

Lightning instantly arced around his body, and his power increased explosively.

Explosive Thunder Pill—this was a pill that could raise one’s battle prowess by two stars!

Ling Han shook his arms and legs. He felt like his body was full of energy.

The Explosive Thunder Pill was a Level Six Divine Pill. Theoretically speaking, it could raise the battle prowess of an elite at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier by two stars. However, the higher one’s cultivation level, the lower the increase in battle prowess.

Right now, Ling Han’s battle prowess had already soared to the peak stage of the medium extreme. In other words, the Explosive Thunder Pill hadn’t been able to raise his battle prowess by two stars. Instead, it had only been able to raise it by one star and a bit. However, this was still very terrifying. His power had increased tenfold.

“Come again!” He charged toward the elder from the Heaven’s Sword Palace. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them continued to exchange blows. In terms of power, Ling Han was still inferior to the elder. After all, there was still a difference of one star.

The elder regained his confidence after a while, and said, “Haha, young man, the earlier you die, the earlier you’ll be able to enter the afterlife. Hurry up and end your futile resistance! Let this old man send you on your way. That way, you’ll at least die a less painful death!”

The pill didn’t seem to help his opponent too much.

“Don’t get excited too early!” Ling Han activated the power of heavenly tribulation, and a wisp of heaven’s might instantly surged from his body.

“What?!”

The color instantly drained from the elder’s face. This overwhelming might caused even his heart to constrict.

How could someone unleash such a devastating might? This was far too terrifying! It was as if he were standing before heaven and earth. A sense of boundless fear and awe rose from the bottom of his heart. Before such an immense aura, his power instantly plunged tenfold.

Their power... was on the same level now.

“How is this possible?!” the elder yelped in astonishment.

Ling Han smiled faintly. Apart from him, who else could leisurely study and analyze heavenly tribulation? Who else could comprehend the Heavenly Dao? When others endured their heavenly tribulation, they all had to unleash their full power. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s physique was a level above his cultivation. Thus, he could remain calm and relaxed even amid his heavenly tribulation.

“Old geezer, accept your death!”

Although the elder was astonished, he didn’t become panicked. His opponent did indeed possess all kinds of techniques. However, their power was still at the same level at this moment. So, what was there to be afraid of?

“You’re still 10,000,000 years too young to kill me!” the elder said with a humph. He unsheathed a sword and slashed at Ling Han.

He was an elder of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, so he was naturally an elite in the Sword Dao. Moreover, the sword in his hand was a Level Seven God Tool. He had nurtured this sword for countless years, and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was one with the sword. Their combined might was greater than the sum of their individual might.

As his sword swung forward, nothing about him seemed old. Instead, he was like a panther leaping through the air. A profound sword intent radiated from his body, and it drew on the great might of heaven and earth as it slashed toward Ling Han.

“Is that so?” Ling Han said with a cold smile. He unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword.

Weng!

His sword dazzled brilliantly as it unleashed a formidable might. One had to realize that the Divine Demon Sword had also experienced heavenly tribulation several times. Moreover, it was nurtured by Ling Han’s martial intent day and night, causing it to also be engraved with heaven’s might.

Although it was only a Level Five God Tool, its might far exceeded this level. It was like Ling Han—its battle prowess couldn’t be determined by its level.

Once the Divine Demon Sword appeared, the sword in the elder’s hand instantly lost its luster.

After all, the Divine Demon Sword was forged from Devouring Metal, a supreme material that could evolve to Divine Metal in the future!

The elder truly started to panic at this moment. His opponent’s sword was far too vicious. In fact, it caused a sense of terror to grip at his heart.

Ling Han unleashed his Lightning Sword Technique at the elder.

The elder hurriedly parried, yet Ling Han’s sword technique was both quick and powerful. This exhausted him in no time, and he felt as if he would be killed if he made any mistake.

His body was drenched in cold sweat. It was as if he were treading the fine line between life and death. One mistake, and his life would come to an end. A boundless chill gripped at his body. Right now, all he wanted was to flee from this godforsaken place. He wanted to return to the sect, where he could ask a great elite to kill this young man.

However, the longer they battled, the bolder Ling Han became. The might of the Divine Demon Sword had given him a pleasant surprise. ‘As expected of something that can evolve to Divine Metal in the future. Not only is it malleable, but it’s also immensely powerful.’

It was as if the Divine Demon Sword had originally been at or even above the Genesis Tier. He simply needed to unlock its potential with his power. By doing so, he would be able to unleash a devastating might.

His Divine Sword possessed the potential to soar through the heavens; who could withstand its power?

Pu, pu, pu, pu!

Blood sprayed through the air, and the elder was drenched in blood as waves upon waves of Sword Qi slashed toward him. This was the true might of the Divine Demon Sword. The Sword Qi that it unleashed would transform in tens of thousands of sword projections, each of which was deadly.

The elder was cornered, and he couldn’t help but shout, “Who on earth are you? Why are you targeting the Heaven’s Sword Palace?!”

Ling Han almost burst into laughter. ‘Has your head been trampled by a donkey? It was clearly you people who targeted me first. Why are you twisting the facts?’

He shook his head, and said, “Since you’ve asked, I really do have great animosity toward the Heaven’s Sword Palace. One day, I’ll erase this sect from the face of the Immortal Realm!”

The elder was stunned. His opponent really did have animosity toward the Heaven’s Sword Palace?

“I’ll tell you before you die. I’m from the Lower Realm!” Ling Han said coldly. His attacks became even quicker as he spoke, and he sent tens of thousands of sword projections toward the elder.

Each sword projection was equivalent to the full-power strike of Ling Han, so how could the elder withstand them?

“Y-y-you’re Ling Han! Aaaah...!” A person suddenly flashed into the elder’s mind. However, he was instantly sent flying by the sword projections, with both of his arms being sliced off. Columns of blood spurted into the air.

However, it was as if he hadn’t felt this, and he simply stared at Ling Han in shock. There was an incredulous look in his eyes.

Everyone in the Five Sects knew of Ling Han. He had opened the sky and ascended to the Immortal Realm, destroying the Five Sects’ operation of countless years in the process.

However, only a few years had passed, so how had this person advanced from the Shattering Void Tier to the Sun Moon Tier? Moreover, his battle prowess was far too astounding. He was clearly at the middle stage of the low extreme, yet even the elder wasn’t his opponent.

Such a formidable enemy was actually lurking right under the Five Sects’ nose!
