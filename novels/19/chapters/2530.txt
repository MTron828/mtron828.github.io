Chapter 2531: Messing around again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han ran out, and sensed for Zhuo Kai’s aura. Then, he immediately flew out.

Though this was the martial academy, it was really, really too huge. One would not be able to see a structure or a few passersby once every short distance. No, no, no, there were only two to three abodes constructed on a single peak at most here, and passersby were incredibly few and far between.

The great dragon carriage had naturally been taken by Zhuo Kai. Thus, he was traveling very quickly, but Ling Han’s speed was even faster. As he traveled rapidly, not too long later, he saw that great dragon pulling the carriage behind it and galloping swiftly ahead of him.

Ling Han channeled the Regulations of Space, and in a few bursts of teleportation, he rapidly closed the distance between them.

The great dragon was still a Celestial King, for better or worse. Immediately, it sensed that something was off. It turned its head, and discovered that Ling Han was actually approaching aggressively. Involuntarily, it couldn’t help but shudder, and its four legs became weak. It hurriedly stopped, trembling in fear.

It had developed a healthy fear of Ling Han from being beaten. Furthermore, it had witnessed how hardcore Ling Han’s tastes were. What if he pushed the dragon together with some tiger or male bear as well? Then, how would it be able to face others in future?

“Milord!” This dragon sent out a message through divine sense, trying its best to curry favor with Ling Han.

Ling Han felt disdain. His impression of dragons was that they should be noble and proud, soaring above the Nine Heavens. How could they possibly be so materialistic?

“Why have we stopped?” Zhuo Kai opened the door of the carriage and walked out. When he discovered that the great dragon was actually playing dead and not moving at all, he was instantly angered, but when he spied Ling Han out of the corner of his eye, he couldn’t help but shake, and showed an expression that contained both fury and fear.

He naturally held a deep hatred for Ling Han, who had caused him to become the butt of everyone’s jokes. However, at the same time, he was also afraid of Ling Han. Underneath absolutely crushing strength, he feared that he would be messed around with horribly again.

“Young Master Zhuo, what is it?” Another person walked out. Who else could it be but that purple robed young man, Wu Shi?

He, too, spotted Ling Han, and his expression involuntarily turned livid. He recalled that matter of the past that he could not bear to look back on. He wanted nothing more than to dig a hole to bury himself in. At the same time, he also longed to rush forth and kill Ling Han.

But in the end, he shut his mouth, and did not say a word.

Ling Han cracked a grin. “I think that the Crimson Bright Fire Pill is not too bad. Could you bear to part with it and gift it to me?”

Zhuo Kai almost cursed loudly. The reason he had taken out this alchemical pill was so he could find someone to deal with Ling Han. If Ling Han snatched it from him, what had he done then? Pleasing his enemy with a gift?

He could not be a fool like that.

“If I refuse… could it be that you will snatch it from me!” Zhuo Kai exclaimed harshly, but it was clearly just putting on a tough act.

Ling Han shook his head. “No, no, no. I would have only picked up an alchemical pill from the ground, and definitely would not have stolen it from anyone. You can’t frame me, or I will beat you up everytime I see you!”

Zhuo Kai was confused. Could anyone pick up a Crimson Bright Fire Pill from the ground?

He had barely finished the thought when he felt his vision blue.?Peng, a fist had already struck him, and then?peng, peng, peng, the clothes that he was wearing once again exploded into bits after a series of heavy punches. His Spatial God Tool had also been beaten till it burst, and that Crimson Bright Fire Pill naturally fell onto the ground.

Only now did Zhuo Kai know what Ling Han meant with his earlier words. He couldn’t help but explode in fury. Ling Han had really gone too far; he would definitely complain to his great-grandfather, and ask his ancestor to step out and suppress this evil villain.

Then, it finally sank into him to cover himself, and he hurriedly covered his lower half.

Ling Han shook his head. “Looks like you haven’t given up on your malice. You should get another treatment. Er…” He looked towards Wu Shi. “What was your name again?”

Wu Shi made no reply, but merely kept his guard up.

“Hehe, don’t be nervous. You can be the husband this time.” Ling Han moved, and grabbed out at Wu Shi.

Though Wu Shi resisted with all his might, how could he possibly manage to defend himself? He was easily captured by Ling Han, and with a surge of power, he, too, once again became naked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No!” The two men were both shaking their behinds, releasing anguished wails.

Ling Han chuckled. He first threw Zhuo Kai onto the carriage, and then threw Wu Shi in as well so that the two of them were laid out on top of one another. Then, playing the same trick, he tapped a specific point on each of them, causing them to roar in pain as they began to twist their bodies rhythmically.

Instantly, the carriage began to sway.

Ling Han even closed the carriage doors very nicely. The great dragon was spying on Ling Han quietly, and when it saw how Ling Han’s eyes turned on it, it hurriedly turned back round in fear.

“Stay here obediently, or I will slaughter you next time and make you into a stew!” Ling Han threatened.

The great dragon hurriedly nodded. It could tell by how Ling Han’s eyes were shining, and by a glint of drool at the corner of Ling Han’s lips, that this was a glutton that could not be more obvious. This was not just an empty threat.

Ling Han picked up the Crimson Bright Fire Pill, then turned, and left. When the drinking party was over, everyone would also see the “carriage s*x.”

He returned to Xuan Ying’s abode, and sat together with the Empress. At this time, Xuan Ying just happened to be talking about matters of the great Realm War, which soon captured Ling Han’s attention.

This was different from what he had imagined.

Hysteria had taken the form of a dimension. Thus, what it had launched was a Realm War. Its main power was focused on suppressing the Flaming Frost Realm, but it was too strong. A single thought could create innumerable elites.

Thus, all the elites were actually battling with the divine sense of Hysteria.

The strength of Hysteria had already surpassed the range of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. It was a genuine overlord of a dimension. Furthermore, it had devoured a considerable number of other dimensions—and merely three of them had already been transcendent dimensions. It was really, really too strong.

Ling Han himself had once been the overlord of a realm, and clearly remembered how he only had to have a thought, and he could form any kind of being he wished at the time—as long as their overall power did not surpass the maximum limits of the realm.

Hysteria was naturally capable of this as well. Furthermore, it was even stronger. There were many that had reached the level of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate among the elites it had mobilized. More importantly, it was a dimension itself, so its power was endless. It was fine no matter how many Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates died as it could mobilize endless numbers of them.

Of course, aside from Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, there were also Fifth Tier and Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates. In fact, there were also Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, and they formed a great army. Their main priority was to attack their defense lines, and start a massacre after entering into Flaming Frost Realm.

The strength of a dimension greatly depended on the beings of this dimension. If the Flaming Frost Realm was massacred, Hysteria would be able to easily devour this dimension.

The Realm Battlefield was extremely dangerous, and the slightest wrong move could result in death. However, at the same time, it was also filled with opportunities because as long as one could manage to kill Hysteria’s creations, they could obtain benefits from the corpses left behind, which would stimulate the boost of one’s cultivation level, and even help him to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

This was also why a great many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would go to the Realm Battlefield. Of course, the number of Celestial Kings that had died in battle was also shockingly high, but for that sliver of hope, even more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings ventured there one after another.

Ling Han anticipated venturing there greatly, but that place was the most dangerous place that only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be worthy of setting foot in. If he went there now, it would completely be an act of suicide.

He had best wait for a while longer.

Ling Han suppressed his impulsive urge. Subsequently, Xuan Ying took charge of the drinking party, and encouraged them to socialize among themselves, and see if they could encounter someone they liked.

“Let’s go.”

The Empress tugged on Ling Han’s hand, and the two people left the abode. They then went to the Empress’s accommodations.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was not here. She had her own abode, and was presently in a state of seclusion, attempting to break through to the Third Heaven. Thus, Ling Han had no plans to disturb her. And in Hu Niu’s case, she had already left the martial academy, and she probably would not be returning anytime soon.

“That is a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and his title is Earnest Meditation,” the Empress informed him.

Ling Han nodded. He took out the Crimson Bright Fire Pill. “I want to study this alchemical pill, and if I could trace its composition through analysis… Oh, right, where’s Wally?”
