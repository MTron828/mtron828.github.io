2771 Easily killed

Zhuo Bing appeared, standing proudly in midair.

He had the same thought as the Imperial Void. He wanted to dispose of Ling Han when the latter was about to enter the Realm Battlefield, or there would be some problems.

Although it was only minor trouble, why suffer it if it could be avoided?

“Brother Zhuo, you take down that villain, and then join hands with me to suppress this weird woman,” the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate said.

Zhuo Bing nodded. Originally, he couldn’t have cared less about a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, but the Empress was so powerful that he also became curious, wanting to know the reason.

For them, improving their cultivation level and increasing their strength actually surpassed everything else in importance—even their own sons couldn’t compare.

Zhuo Bing looked at Ling Han coldly, and a cold smile appeared at the corners of his mouth. In his point of view, a cripple was naturally easy to capture, even if there was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King by his side to protect him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Would you believe that I can send you flying with one slap?”

Zhuo Bing didn’t want to bother responding at all. The current Ling Han could only show off his ability with his mouth. Was there a need for Zhuo Bing to argue with a cripple?

He stretched out his hands to grab Ling Han.

Boom! Endless power condensed and turned into a giant dark golden hand, upon which seals that surpassed Regulations appeared. These were Heavenly Venerable Seals, but there was no way to manifest them. They were indeterminate and difficult to grasp.

With a single palm strike, he wanted to take down Ling Han and Bewitching Maiden Rou together.

Ling Han shook his head, and countered with a palm strike. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Boom! Similarly, endless power condensed and transformed into a massive golden hand that met Zhuo Bing’s hand.

In that single exchange of blows, the giant dark golden hand instantly exploded, while the golden palm didn’t stop, but continued on its course towards Zhuo Bing.

“What?!”

Zhuo Bing turned pale with shock. Wasn’t Ling Han a cripple? How could he have such formidable strength? ‘Are you kidding me? If he is considered a cripple, then what does that make me? A major cripple?’

Before Zhuo Bing could finish his thought, the giant hand was already close to hitting him.

Zhuo Bing quickly dodged, but it was too late, so he could only protect his body—to be exact, the attack hit his face because this palm strike was aimed at it.

Pa! The slap landed, and he was sent flying immediately.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! It was unknown just how many mountains he had broken along the way, but Zhuo Bing had only one thought in his mind: ****, what kind of a cripple was this person? He was a f****** Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Zhuo Bing was terrified to the core, so much that he didn’t even spare causing trouble for Ling Han a thought; his only thought was to run away.

Run; the farther he could get away from this “crippled” Ling Han, the better.

In this life, he would no longer believe the claim that Ling Han was crippled—this was a scam, sh*t!

Zhuo Bing steadied his body, and was about to turn around and run, but was shocked to see another big hand grabbing him. “I said that I would send you flying with a slap, didn’t I?”

It was none other than Ling Han!

Zhuo Bing only felt his heart severely constrict. Fortunately, a Heavenly Venerate would have at least this bit of composure. He remained calm in the face of danger, and just barely stretched out his hand to block the strike. As long as he could catch his breath, no matter how serious the injury, he didn’t care—he only wanted to escape.

Pa, he attempted to parry, but his arm seemed to be made of noodles, and was absolutely unable to withstand the strike. Ling Han’s hand drove straight in and grabbed his chest.

He was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, yet was not able to even withstand a single blow!

As for the current Ling Han, his Intent Realm had reached perfection, and he had the power of all the dimensions in the Genesis World in his body. How terrifying would the eruption of such power be?

He could possibly rival a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han grabbed Zhuo Bing. He shook his right hand several times. Under the violent impact, Zhuo Bing’s bones were smashed to pieces, and he had completely lost all his battle prowess.

Ling Han took another step, and instantly returned to the valley.

Of course, the current valley had completely disappeared, flattened by the battle prowess of two Heavenly Venerates.

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was fighting fiercely with the Empress. He didn’t realize that Zhuo Bing had been sent flying with a slap just now. Seeing a figure flying towards him, his only thought was that Zhuo Bing had already taken down Ling Han.

He laughed loudly. “Brother Zhuo, so you have taken down that brat?”

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate turned his head, and his expression suddenly became extremely interesting.

What in the world was going on?

Apparently, Ling Han, who ought to have been captured without a fight, was holding Zhuo Bing with his hand, while Zhuo Bing was dangling limply like a dead dog.

He had to be seeing things.

A cripple had taken down a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, and in such a short period of time?

‘That has got to be a lie.’

In that moment of distraction, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was struck nearly head-on by the Empress, which sent him retreating for several kilometers, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth—one had to pay the price for one’s own negligence.

However, he took no notice of it at all, and just stared blankly at Ling Han, as if he was seeing a ghost.

Ling Han smiled. “You’re extremely disappointed and shocked, aren’t you?”

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate finally calmed down, and said, “You weren’t crippled!”

So this was all a smokescreen to deceive him.

Ling Han shook his head. “Don’t think too highly of yourself. I disdain stooping to that level.”

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate pondered. “You were indeed crippled before, but now not only have you recovered, but your strength has improved?”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded.

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate turned around, and was about to tear a rip in space to leave.

Even Zhuo Bing, someone stronger than him, was defenseless, let alone him.

He even wondered: if the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable made a move, could he do anything to Ling Han?

Run, run back to the Realm Battlefield.

...

It was just that the Imperial Void had obviously overestimated his own ability, or underestimated Ling Han’s strength. Peng! The space that he had just torn apart immediately shattered, and a big hand stretched over, grabbing his neck.

It was Ling Han!

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate turned pale in shock. Although he had seen that Zhuo Bing had been taken down by Ling Han, and concluded that Ling Han’s strength had to be superior, he hadn’t directly witnessed it. It was only now that he knew how strong Ling Han was.

In other words, he now knew how overwhelming would the suppression of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate against a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate be.

Pa, he was powerless to resist, and eventually fell into Ling Han’s hands.

He only felt anger and resentment. In the past, when he had wanted to kill Ling Han, it had just been a simple matter as easy as turning his hand over, but now, even if he had become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, he wasn’t Ling Han’s match at all.

He regretted it; he regretted it so deeply.

“Feeling regret?” Ling Han smiled. “Heh, what you should feel regret for is why you didn’t make any contribution to the Celestial Realm back then, and why you insisted on bullying me, which led to consequences that you are facing now. Everything that has happened… You asked for it!”

“Brat, kill me as you wish, but don’t even think that I will bow down to you!” the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate shouted. Having become a Heavenly Venerate, he had to be a person with a firm will. How could he be spineless?

“Okay.” Ling Han nodded, and with a shake of his left hand, all the bones in Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate’s body were smashed to pieces.

He put both his hands together again. Peng! The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate and Zhuo Bing crashed into each other, and became a bloody mess. Both of them were mushed together, which was deserving of them after having joined forces for once.

...

Ling Han casually threw down the corpses of the two Heavenly Venerates. In his eyes, the Imperial Void was merely a small character. The two people whom he really remembered were the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate. The Green Flames Heavenly Venerate was fine, because she didn’t become enemies with him after all, and even crossed paths with him once, so he didn’t have any strong animosity for her.

The one man and two women continued to forge ahead, heading towards the Realm Battlefield.

What made Ling Han wonder whether he ought to be happy or disappointed was that no one else came out to attack him anymore.

“Did they believe that I wouldn’t be able to escape death when the Imperial Void and Zhuo Bing made a move, and thus did not even bother to make another move, or are these two people the only ones who insisted on putting me to death?” Ling Han murmured.
