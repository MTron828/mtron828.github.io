2976 Fighting For The Core of the Dimension

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains laughed coldly as he struck out once more.

All the Seventh Tiers from the Genesis World of the last era were here now. And with just Lin Luo and Bai Fan, how could they be stopped?

Ling Han was a dead man.

Lin Luo struck, but was blocked by Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan. Meanwhile, Bai Fan’s blow was stopped by Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper.

Who else was there?

Weng! A figure appeared out of nowhere, punching back at Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s giant hand, and causing it to disintegrate immediately.

This… was another Seventh Tier?

Yes, it was Xin Fu.

Ling Han was shocked. Why would Xin Fu help him?

Back in the Realm Battlefield, Xin Fu had always accused him of being a traitor. Moreover, Ling Han was an old rival of Xin Qihu. As such, Xin Fu was the least likely Seventh Tier to help him out.

However, events did turn out as such, and Xin Fu actually was helping Ling Han out at a very crucial time.

“Xin Fu!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains barked angrily. He never understood him all this while. Xin Fu had clearly been antagonistic to Ling Han on the surface, yet he was helping them out time and again. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was utterly confused.

Xin Fu smiled. “A moment has passed. Should you all not be returning now?”

“Hmph, if I don’t kill that brat, I swear that I am less than a man!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains declared. It was absolutely humiliating for him to have had his doppelganger destroyed by Ling Han.

“Die!” He struck out, but this time he wasn’t sending a palm strike from afar—he was directly going after Ling Han.

Chong Yan guarded against Lin Luo, Big Dipper guarded against Bai Fan, and Half Moon guarded against Xin Fu. Who else was there to save Ling Han?

“Let me have a go at it!”

A cheerful laughter resounded as a slender figure appeared out of nowhere and charged straight at Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

Boom! Both sides struck out, generating a terrifying energy shock wave from the clash.

The mystery person flew backwards from the blast, but Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s blow was stopped as well.

Who… was this person?

Everyone looked at the figure, and couldn’t help revealing expressions of shock.

Soon, their surprise was replaced with a sense of astonishment and excitement.

What did it mean for Zhou Heng to be able to stop this blow?

It meant that he was now a Seventh Tier. Otherwise, no matter how strong a Sixth Tier could be, there was no stopping an attack from a Seventh Tier.

It was clear that Zhou Heng had just broken through to the Seventh Tier, which was why his power was weaker. However, Seventh Tiers were indestructible, so what did it matter if his power was weaker?

Even though everyone knew it was a matter of time before Zhou Heng would break through to the Seventh Tier, they were still shocked to see that he had actually done it.

Another Seventh Tier was born to the Genesis World. This was naturally something to rejoice about.

“So what if you’ve broken through to the Seventh Tier? I can still defeat you with one hand,” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said coldly. He wasn’t lying. Even though Seventh Tiers were indestructible, there was still a great difference in strength.

“What if I join the mix then?” Chu Hao’s voice echoed as he slowly approached. His body was wrapped in flames, just like an invincible being.

“You broke through to the Seventh Tier as well!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s expression finally changed. He had never expected this to happen. In just a little over 10 billion years, there were two who broke through to the Seventh Tier outside of his knowledge.

Chu Hao smiled, and said, “Senior Brother Zhou and I are but newly inducted juniors in front of Friend Shatter Mountains. This is why we’ve so boldly decided to team up and receive some teachings from Friend Shatter Mountains.”

Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s expression was gloomy. If it was just Zhou Heng or Chu Hao, he would be confident of defeating them easily.

The problem was that there were two of them now. Even though both of them had just broken through to the Seventh Tier, and their battle prowess had yet to reach the peak, their strength was still at an equal rank with his. How could he possibly take such a situation lightly?

‘Can I still kill Ling Han?’

Difficult! Much too difficult!

All he wanted was to kill a puny little Fourth Tier. Why did it have to be so hard?

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains no longer attacked. Even though they still had a slight advantage on the surface, it was only a matter of time before Wu Zhihong and Heavenly Venerate Blood Rainbow would show up as well. They were the ones who would be at a disadvantage by then. As such, it didn’t matter if they continued to attack or not.

Shua! At this moment, a massive black figure appeared out of nowhere, bringing forth an indescribable pressure. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hysteria!

There were only two Seventh Tiers fighting against Hysteria then. How could they possibly stop the number one elite?

Hysteria’s intent was clear. It wanted to eliminate every single person present with a single blow.

This was no bold claim. Hysteria was much too powerful. If there was another tier above the Seventh Tier, then that would make Hysteria an Eighth Tier. The only reason Hysteria was momentarily stopped was because Seventh Tiers had an indestructible body, and could use superior numbers to their advantage.

Everyone else posed no threat at all, so who could stop Hysteria?

Lin Luo and the other Seventh Tiers all shouted as they attacked the giant tentacle.

Peng!

As both sides clashed, a terrible energy storm erupted. That was not something even a Sixth Tier could get involved in, and they all hurriedly escaped the chaos. Ultimately, Hysteria’s attack was blocked.

Ling Han witnessed everything with his own eyes, and couldn’t contain his shock.

He had a rough idea of how powerful a Seventh Tier was, and yet even with 10 of them joining hands, it was only enough to block a single blow from Hysteria. Hysteria was simply too powerful. It was no wonder that the coalition army was consistently beaten back by it.

Boom, boom, boom. The intense battle erupted, and Hysteria exerted its full force, with nothing to be concerned about.

Against such an elite, not even Ling Han could muster up any resistance. The best he could do was run, run and run as far away as he could from the center of the battle.

Wu Zhihong and Heavenly Venerate Blood Rainbow had also arrived by then, and all 12 Seventh Tiers joined hands to combat Hysteria.

Under the terrifying explosions, the final vestiges of the Flaming Frost Realm were soon ripped to pieces as well. A bright light suddenly shone, illuminating the cold dark world.

The core of the dimension!

Everyone was taken aback at first, but they soon came to their senses.

Before this, it had been near impossible for one to get close to the core of a transcendent dimension, as it would be able to manipulate the entirety of the energy of heaven and earth. This was much too terrifying. Even though a Seventh Tier had an indestructible body, there were still limits to their strength, and they would be blocked outside.

But now, the Flaming Frost Realm was practically gone. So what if the core of the dimension was still here? There was nothing for it to work with anymore. And since it couldn’t manipulate the energy of heaven and earth, it could only be used to nourish the strength of cultivators.

Naturally, even though the core of the dimension was in a “weakened” state, it was still not something anyone could get close to. They had to be a Heavenly Venerate at least, otherwise they would be crushed to bits instantly by the intense energy.

‘Take it.’

Everyone clearly knew that their objective here was the core of the dimension. Now that the treasure was in sight, why would they still need to be courteous?

The fight for the core of the dimension began. No matter who it was, they were going all out to try and escape with the core of the dimension.

However, the energy storms here had formed a natural barrier. Moreover, the area around it was in complete chaos. Everyone could only watch in vain as the ball of light danced in the air, unable to get close.

Naturally, Ling Han was pulling all the stops to take it as well.

Rightfully, there shouldn’t be anyone to contend with him. However, Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the rest were still out to get him, and would launch an attack at him from time to time. Even though they weren’t seriously attacking, how could Ling Han possibly risk taking it lightly?

As the chaos ensued, a black figure appeared out of nowhere. Bang, bang, bang. Wherever she went, the people nearby instantly burst into bits. Sixth Tiers were also no exception.

She charged straight at the core of the dimension with no one able to stop her.
