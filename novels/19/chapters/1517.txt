1518 This new student is so fierce

“Enough, this is not the eighth campus.” Ren Feiyun stood between them. “Don’t let others make fun of us!”

Only then did Qi Tian and Cai Miao humph and let go of their aggression.

Though traditions could not be abolished, the reputation of the eighth campus was similarly important. If they burst into an internal conflict in public, then even they would be ashamed.

Big shots such as Ren Feiyun and Qi Tian also attempted to open the chest, but they were all unsuccessful. It was not that they didn’t have enough power, but rather that their physique still lacked a bit. The Second in the World who boasted of having impressive physique was determined to use brute force. In the end, he used too much force, and burst a hole into his pants, causing everyone to erupt in laughter.

His physique was strong enough, but his power was still a little short, and in the end, he did not succeed.

And precisely because he had been close to succeeding, he managed to open the chest slightly. A sacred golden light surged out, causing him to exert more force and try his best. In the end, after he transformed into a barbaric bear, he directly tore his pants.

No one laughed at the Second in the World. He had already done something that even the big shots did not manage to do. Furthermore, it also allowed the others to see some hope—this chest could indeed be opened!

Additionally, that light was so sacred and grand. If it was claimed that there were no supreme rare treasures hidden within, no one would believe that!

“As long as their physique is close to Second in the World but stronger, they would definitely be able to open this chest.”

“But this kind of person... Does he exist?”

Everyone shook their heads. There were many people with high cultivation levels here, but there should not be a single person whose physique had reached the level of Second in the World.

“Ling Han!” a new student suddenly called out.

“That’s right, there’s Ling Han!” another new student exclaimed.

The seniors might not be aware, but the new students had all personally witnessed the fierce battle between Ling Han and the Second in the World. They had crashed into each other a few hundred to over a thousand times, and in the end, even a wild bull like the Second in the World could not help but admit defeat.

That was proof that the strength of Ling Han’s physique was superior to even the Second in the World!

“But Senior Brother Ling’s cultivation level is more or less the same as that of the Second in the World, and the Second in the World was not able to open the chest, so most likely, Senior Brother Ling won’t be able to, either.”

“Humph, Senior Brother Ling has defeated Second in the World, so who knows, he may be able to!”

“That’s right. Who knows if he can if he hasn’t even tried?”

Everyone went off in search, and soon focused their eyes on Ling Han.

“Junior Brother Ling, come give it a try.” A senior beckoned him over.

How could Ling Han be willing to? If he opened the box, allowing others to know that it was completely empty inside, would Gu Daoyi still come?

“Humph, and he still calls himself first among the new students; he doesn’t even have the courage to try!” someone scoffed. It was unknown whether he was trying to deliberately belittle Ling Han, or trying to spur him into trying out.

These words were not pleasant to hear. Ling Han cast one look one that person, and said, “If you want to act wretched, no one can control you. But if you bite others madly like a crazy dog, then you are simply asking for a beating!”

That person did not belong to the eighth campus. Though he was a senior, and usually should not have much conflict with Ling Han, he just happened to dislike Ling Han. He scoffed, “This Junior Brother, you have been very popular recently!”

His name was Bian Du, and he had entered into the academy 1,000,000 years ago. When he had entered, he ranked 39th, but through these years, the original ranking of the 100 had already changed greatly.

Some had died when they had been exploring ancient sites, while others had faced setbacks. Meanwhile, he belonged to those who had improved. His rank had risen up from the 39th place all the way to the eighth. Thus, he also had a very high opinion of himself.

Now, even the big shots were not able to open the chest, but there were actually so many people that thought Ling Han was good enough, which made him feel a little jealous. Ling Han had actually avoided being taken down a notch, and had not crawled through the dog’s hole, which made him very envious. With these two factors added together, they resulted in him deliberately mocking Ling Han.

Ling Han stood up. In any case, Gu Daoyi had not arrived yet. He had nothing to do at the moment, so why not pass the time with a fight? “Oh, are you envious?”

“Haha!” Bian Du laughed coldly. “My cultivation level is the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and in terms of strength, I rank eighth among the new students from the last batch. Is there any need for me to be envious of you?”

“Then why are you blabbering so much!” Ling Han waved him off dismissively. “Just go somewhere you’re actually wanted.”

“You’re asking for a beating!” Bian Du shot out. In the academy, there was no ban on spars among students, what more here. If it was not for the fact that there were outsiders here, even if he killed him, so what?

Those from the eighth campus shook their heads. None of them were optimistic about Bian Du’s chances.

What a joke; Ling Han had already used strength to prove that no one beneath the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier was a match for him. ‘You are only in the medium extreme; aren’t you simply asking to be thrashed?’

But no one went to remind Bian Du. In a conflict between two campuses, they would naturally be helping someone from their own campus. After all, the conflict between senior and junior students was an internal affair, and would be resolved behind closed doors.

Ling Han moved. He shot out a punch very casually.

Bian Du smirked coldly. ‘You actually dare to look down on me like this; you will be crying later.’

“Sigh!” On the side of the eighth campus, there were already a great many people sighing.

“Don’t take it to heart. Ling Han is just a newly enrolled student; isn’t it very normal for him to lose to a senior brother from a previous batch?” The people from the other campuses were all saying such things. In their opinion, wasn’t it something very normal for a new student to lose to a senior?

“We are not sighing for Ling Han, but rather for Bian Du!” Someone from the eighth campus snickered. “I hope Senior Brother Bian won’t be too seriously wounded.”

Pu!

Those from the other campuses all spluttered in laughter. What kind of joke was that? There was a whole gap of a minor level between these two people. Even if he was a rank three king tier, so what? Bian Du was also a king tier himself.

‘You guys from the eighth campus are really jokers!’

Bian Du also heard this bit of idle gossip. It had been transmitted through divine sense, so its speed was fast enough. He couldn’t help but become furious. His hands formed claws, and grabbed out ruthlessly at Ling Han. He decided to tear off Ling Han’s arms by force so everyone would know that the so-called number one of the new students was not enough in front of the seniors, especially in front of him.

He should be the one who would be the focus of everyone’s attention. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The punch blasted over, an upright and frontal attack.

Bian Du slashed out a claw. He wanted to first sever this arm of Ling Han’s.

Peng!

The fist landed. Bian Du paled; his attack was as frail as a piece of paper in front of the other attack. The punch continued on without any hindrance, directly landing on his chest.

How was this possible?

Bian Du gasped internally, but his whole person was already sent flying with the force, just like a kite with a broken tail.

Seeing this scene, everyone was speechless.

Though many seniors had heard that Ling Han had gotten the first place in the competition among new students this time, and the great battle he had had with Gu Daoyi was frightening, and was rumored to have gone to the extent of the consummate level, did anyone actually believe that?

Unless they saw it with their own eyes, who would believe that two people who had just broken through to the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier would be able to possess battle prowess on the level of the consummate level?

It had to be that the new students were too ignorant and exaggerated it. Furthermore, the more rumors spread, the more would naturally be added onto the original story. Who knew, if it continued to spread for a few more years, these two people might be rumored to have battle prowess of Saints.

But now, one punch from Ling Han was enough to defeat Bian Du. This was not just mere rumor, but something they witnessed with their own eyes.

Oh, how was this new student so terrifying!
