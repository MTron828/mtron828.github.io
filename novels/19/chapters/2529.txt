Chapter 2530: Forced to retreat

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Fight your sister!

Xiao Yingxiong almost cursed out loud. Previously, though he had defended himself with his full effort, it had not caused even the slightest ripple. He had still been beaten terribly.

Another fight?

“We will enter into the third level of the great formation and battle again!” Xiao Yingxiong declared darkly. He was not willing to take advantage of Ling Han, either, because Ling Han was precisely in the Third Heaven.

“All right!” Ling Han agreed decisively.

They entered into the formation once more, and then immediately began another great battle.

This time, Xiao Yingxiong clearly had a better fighting chance. That was because the Third Heaven was indeed Ling Han’s true cultivation level, and he no longer had the advantage of suppression on cultivation levels.

However, merely in terms of Regulations, Ling Han could match Xiao Yingxiong, and in terms of Body Art, he was slightly superior. With these two factors combined, it was equivalent to having two Ling Hans joining forces to fight Xiao Yingxiong.

Was this something that Xiao Yingxiong could match?

In only a few hundred moves, he was defeated once more. His face that had originally been swollen had now become even more unbearable to see.

“Someone has come out!”

“Is it still Li Si?”

Outside, everyone could see a figure flash by, and reacted with shouts.

It was… Ling Han!

Everyone felt a ruefulness that came out from having their expectations fulfilled. This guy had won again.

Xiao Yingxiong also came out in quick succession, and the sorry way he looked now elicited involuntary laughter.

His expression was dark, the fighting spirit in his eyes burning brightly. After two battles, he naturally realized that aside from the power of Regulation, Ling Han still had Body Art, and the latter would not be suppressed by the Nine Deaths Formation.

However, because Ling Han himself was a Third Heaven, his Body Art also had an upper limit.

If he made a move now, he would be able to suppress Ling Han easily. However, firstly, the martial academy had its rules, and secondly, even if he defeated Ling Han by using his superior cultivation level to suppress him, that would be an unjust battle. What was the point of it, then?

Enter into the fourth level of the great formation to battle again?

Xiao Yingxiong could not bring himself to say this. That would be equivalent to admitting that he was no match for Ling Han in a battle of equal tier.

He looked meaningfully at Ling Han. If Ling Han’s Body Art could improve alongside his cultivation level, it would be eternally impossible that he would be able to match Ling Han in a battle of equal tier, but if that was not the case, it would naturally be a different story.

“Humph!” He left with a flutter of his sleeves. His pride caused him to choose the option of fighting Ling Han again when the latter had progressed further.

“This junior brother, what is the point of putting on a pretense? Tell us your real name!” Gu Heyi said to Ling Han. His face wore an amicable smile, as if he would never get angry.

“A true man never changes his name, regardless of the situation. My name is Li Si,” Ling Han declared smilingly.

Finally, Gu Heyi showed a hint of displeasure. Though he has always been amicable, it did not mean that he had less pride than any other person. On the contrary, this kind of display of humility was only a way to show how proud he was.

Miao Hua also looked furious. “Do you think that just because we are three cultivation levels higher than you, we cannot deal with you?”

“If you’re not happy about it, I’ll see you in the third level of the great formation. In a fair battle, I will suppress every single person who comes to meet me,” Ling Han declared, returning a tit-for-tat reply.

‘Do you guys dare?’

Both Gu Heyi and Miao Hua frowned slightly. Their battle prowess was on equal level with that of Xiao Yingxiong. Even if they were confident that they were stronger than the latter, it would not be too big of a difference. However, Ling Han had not taken too much time to defeat Xiao Yingxiong. Clearly, he had a crushing advantage in terms of strength.

If they battled rashly, it would indeed be unwise.

They decided to first pay a visit to Xiao Yingxiong. The latter had battled twice with Ling Han, so he should have gained some intel on Ling Han.

The two of them did not speak, but rather turned and left at the same time.

Awesome, a Third Heaven Celestial King actually forced Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings to retreat, and these two were two of the top three on the Battle Prowess Board of this term at that.

Everyone was very excited. After today, another, new prodigy would emerge in the martial academy. The level of his freakishness surpassed the extent of Gu Heyi and Miao Hua. He should probably be comparable to Heavenborn, right?

They all returned to Xuan Ying’s abode, and continued the Prospective Partner Ceremony.

However, after the previous major events, everyone’s interest had greatly declined.

“Bastard!” A furious roar rang out as Zhuo Kai shot out like an arrow. He looked here and there, his eyes practically spitting fire in his fury. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was a great humiliation. He had actually had his clothes torn off, and lay on top of a man who was completely naked as well. Furthermore, they had been moving and rubbing against each other at that. Just the mere thought of it caused a feeling of incredible disgust to rise up in him.

More importantly, this scene had even been witnessed by his pals. He knew what kind of personality these two people had. They would definitely broadcast it everywhere. Thus, his “scandal” would definitely be known to everyone by now.

He hated Ling Han, who was the culprit behind all this, to death.

“You!!” He soon discovered Ling Han, and immediately shouted loudly, “I want you to die!”

The Empress was furious, and pointed at Zhuo Kai menacingly. “You lowly wretch should die 10,000 times over!”

Only now did Zhuo Kai see the Empress, and involuntarily withdrew his aura. The Empress’s presence was so strong that he could not even raise his head.

However, his fury was too strong. Very soon, he returned to a state of rage as he promised, “Whoever can kill him for me, I will give them 100,000,000 Star Stones.”

Everyone only acted as if they had not heard anything. As disciples of the martial academy, as well as Celestial King Tier monarch tiers and monarch stars, who would care about 100,000,000 Star Stones?

Zhuo Kai also knew that this was the wrong place to show off his wealth. These people were not his lackeys who would scramble to do his bidding if he only gave them some Star Stones. He thought for a moment, then took out a jade box, and said, “This is a Crimson Bright Fire Pill, which can greatly increase the cultivation level of Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings and below. It can save 10 billion years of hard cultivation, at least.

“Whoever kills that man, this Crimson Bright Fire Pill will belong to them.”

Instantly, a great many people looked tempted.

Having the ability to save them 10 billion years of hard cultivation was extremely astonishing. Who wouldn’t be tempted?

But the problem here was, firstly, that no one dared commit murder in the martial academy, and secondly, just how many people would be able to match Ling Han?

Thus, though everyone felt very tempted, there was still no one who stepped out.

Zhuo Kai was stunned. He was not an idiot, after all. Upon deeper thought, he knew what he had done wrongly. He declared, “Whoever gives him a good thrashing, this Crimson Bright Fire Pill can be bestowed on them too.”

“Cease the nonsense!” A cold humph rang out, and Xuan Ying spoke. He was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but there was actually someone causing chaos in his abode. What would that make him then?

Zhuo Kai raised his head and glanced at him. Then, clasping his hands, he said, “Greetings, Lord Xuan!” He did not show too much respect, because his great-grandfather was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Even though he had only just taken a single step further than a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the distance that this step breached was astonishingly wide.

“Lord Xuan, could you give me some face?” he asked.

The others almost burst into laughter. A mere Third Heaven Celestial King actually dared to ask a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to give him face. He really had no sense of self-awareness. Only a profligate young master like Zhuo Kai could do something like that.

Even Xuan Ying couldn’t help but laugh. Shaking his head, he said, “To think that Senior Zhuo actually has a descendant like you, who knows if there would come a day when you would bring shame to his name.”

He waved a hand dismissively. “Go on.”

Boom, a great power surged out, and Zhuo Kai involuntarily retreated continuously, finally stopping only when he had retreated out of the abode.

He glared angrily at the great doors, but did not enter again.

Since a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had spoken and moved, if Zhuo Kai still did not know what was good for him, it would only be seeking his own suffering.

However, he was definitely not going to let this go.

He turned around furiously, and strode off.

Ling Han immediately whispered into the Empress’s ear. “I’ll be back in a while.” Since Zhuo Kai actually had such a precious item like the Crimson Bright Fire Pill, he definitely could not allow the former to just leave like this.
