Chapter 2162: Ungrateful Cheng Clan

Once Ling Han asked, Ling Yueyan[1] immediately frowned.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Dongxing hurriedly asked.

Ling Yueyan seemed like she wanted to say something, but then hesitated.

“Your elder brother is no stranger. What on earth happened?” Yue Hongchang asked as well.

With the repeated questioning, Ling Yueyan finally answered, “It’s Yifeng.”

“What’s wrong with Yifeng?” Yue Hongchang questioned closely. This Yifeng had the surname of Cheng, and was Ling Yueyan’s husband, as well as the son-in-law of the Ling Clan.

Ling Yueyan answered, “Yifeng said that the Roc Palace has been destroyed, and there is an unspeakable relation between our Ling Clan and the Roc Palace, so he wishes to sever our matrimonial relation to prevent the Cheng Clan from being implicated as well.”

“What!?” Ling Dongxing was immediately furious, and slammed a hand fiercely on the table.

To attain this matrimonial union with the Ling Clan, the Cheng Clan had been extremely humble, and it was also Cheng Yifeng who was the most versed in speaking sweet, pleasant words, such that he had successfully enchanted Ling Yueyan, who had been inexperienced and completely naive.

Actually, Ling Yueyan had had too many options at the time. Who knew how many clans had strength that was far superior to the Cheng Clan’s, yet Ling Yueyan had still ultimately chosen Cheng Yifeng.

The Cheng Clan was a Severing Mundane Tier force. In the Roc Heaven, it was naturally a negligible—to the point of being unnoticeable—force, but no matter how small they were, they were still stronger than the Ling Clan, so why had they gone to so much effort just to get a connection with the Ling Clan?

Naturally, it was because they had their eye on the colossal giant standing behind the Ling Clan, the Roc Palace.

The Cheng Clan’s choice had brought them great benefits. After becoming in-laws with the Ling Clan, the Cheng Clan had obtained a considerably valuable dowry from the Ling Clan, and their clan’s grand elder had even broken through to the Dividing Soul Tier due to this!

But now?

The Roc Palace had been destroyed by the Four Seas Palace, and the Cheng Clan feared that they would be eradicated as well by the Four Seas Palace, so they naturally chose to draw a clear dividing line between themselves and the Ling Clan. However, the Cheng Clan’s level was too low, so it was also late when they received the news. Only now had they finally reacted.

…If the Four Seas Palace wanted to call them for an accounting, how could they have possibly waited until today?

In brief terms, since the Ling Clan no longer had value for exploitation, and could possibly cause detrimental effects on the Cheng Clan, they naturally abandoned this burden immediately.

“What does the Roc Palace being destroyed mean?” Yue Hongchang wore a strange expression. Wasn’t it false? Hu Niu was still standing here.

“I’m not sure, either.” Ling Yueyan was a little dazed. They were all too cut off from recent news.

Ling Han interrupted, “A great change has indeed happened in the Roc Palace.”

“But that bastardly brat should not have left Yueyan at this time, either. What does he mean by that?” Ling Dongxing slammed his hand loudly on the table. His daughter had actually been left, so he was naturally enraged.

“This should not be Yifeng’s own intentions. He must have said so because his clan compelled him to.” Ling Yueyan was still speaking up on behalf of her husband.

Ling Han waved her off, and said, “Sister, let’s go on to the Cheng Clan, and meet with Brother-in-law.”

Ling Yueyan instantly looked troubled. Some time ago, when Cheng Yifeng returned to the Cheng Clan, he never came back again. She could not hold herself back today, and thus went to the Cheng Clan. In the end, Cheng Yifeng chased her away, and said that he wanted to sever their matrimonial relations.

Additionally, there were still a great many people in the valley that belonged to the Cheng Clan. They came here because they had their eye on the resources of the Ling Clan. After all, Hu Niu definitely could not be stingy with Ling Dongxing and his wife. Furthermore, the cultivation resources beneath Celestial medicines really could not be considered much.

These people would also immediately retreat back to the Cheng Clan. After all, the Ling Clan would no longer gain any more benefits from the Roc Palace, so what was the point of staying behind any further?

“This…” Ling Yueyan said hesitatingly. Her heart was still siding with her husband, and hoped that the latter would change his mind, and come back to her.

“Attention to all members of our Cheng Clan, pack up immediately, and return to our clan!” Right at this moment, a person was heard calling out loudly in the valley, his voice rolling out like thunder.

“Yes, Elder Taiheng!” the members of the Cheng Clan all called out in answer, and began packing up. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

They had already gotten all their gains, and now planned to run?

Ling Han humphed, and immediately raced out. His eyes swept around, and he saw that a man was standing in midair. HIs hands were crossed behind his back, a proud expression on his face.

Ths was an elder of the Cheng Clan, someone along the lines of an elder of a sect. His name was Cheng Taiheng, and he was a second severance. This kind of cultivation level was not much in the Celestial Realm, but in this small valley, where the strongest elite was only at the Genesis Tier, he naturally was qualified enough to look down on the people of the valley in contempt.

“Shameless villains can all get out. However, whatever of our Ling Clan that you have used and eaten, return them wholly!” Ling Han declared.

“And who are you?” Cheng Taiheng looked down from his lofty position, looking down on Ling Han.

Because Ling Han had sealed his own aura off with the Source Powers of heaven and earth, no one below Celestial King Tier could possibly see through the depths of his cultivation levels. Cheng Taiheng naturally would consider Ling Han beneath him. The Ling Clan was only supported by the Roc Palace, so how could they have any kind of elites or talents.

In the valley, the members of the Cheng Clan had gradually packed up their belongings, and were preparing to leave.

“Elder Taiheng!” Cheng Zilong leaped out, and knelt down on one knee in front of Cheng Taiheng. “This person has humiliated me before, so please seek justice for my sake, Elder!”

“En?” Cheng Taiheng showed a slight expression of surprise. Cheng Zilong was the most outstanding clansman in the younger generation of the Cheng Clan, and it was precisely because of this that he had been sent here—the cultivation resources that he could obtain here were far superior to what he could gain in the Cheng Clan,

Yet Cheng Zilong was actually outmatched by Ling Han?

‘Impossible!’

However, anger immediately caused him to forget this fact. In any case, the Ling Clan was completely negligible, so what need was there for him to take it to heart? He humphed, and his eyes turned onto Ling Han as he said, “How dare you, to actually dare make a move on one of the members of our Cheng Clan!”

What Ling Han hated the most was ungrateful traitors, and more importantly, the Cheng Clan had gone too far. They had exploited his younger sister to obtain the resources from Roc Palace, and now that Roc Palace had fallen, they couldn’t even wait to separate themselves from the Ling Clan, and even a wife could be thrown aside.

F***, he could not tolerate this.

“I will give Cheng Yifeng three days to kneel with every step he takes, and come seek forgiveness from my younger sister. However, I will slaughter the entire Cheng Clan until no one is left alive!” Ling Han declared coldly. If he had not seen the expectant expression on Ling Yueyan’s face, and knew that she was completely besotted with Cheng Yifeng, he wouldn’t even bother.

All ungrateful traitors should all just be killed.

“Hahahaha, where has this arrogant madman come from, he really has no idea of his own weight!” Cheng Taiheng smirked coldly.

“Elder, please seek justice for me!” Cheng Zilong hurriedly begged once more.

“All right!” Cheng Taiheng suppressed the slight doubt in his heart. It was definitely impossible that the Ling Clan had any kind of elite. He stretched out his right hand, which moved to cover Ling Han.?Weng, Regulations manifested in a gigantic inky black hand, which grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t bother to move, and only breathed out towards Cheng Taiheng.

Whoosh!

Wild winds blew madly, and that black gigantic hand instantly shattered in the wind, and the great gust did not slow its speed, and immediately rushed towards Cheng Taiheng.?Shua, shua, shua.?The hurricane winds were as sharp as blades, and the flesh and blood from Cheng Taiheng’s body was visibly scraped off cleanly, leaving behind only a skeleton, and then the skeleton itself was also shattered.

When the wild winds had passed, Cheng Taiheng’s whole person had vanished completely.

Deathly silence descended.

That was Cheng Taiheng, a grand second severance elder, and he had actually been killed with the breeze someone had breathed out.

This… monster, he had to be a monster!

Cheng Zilong’s whole body shuddered, and an indescribable chill rose up from the depths of his heart as his legs involuntarily trembled.

[1] Longer names like this one and others in the first several hundred chapters of the novel were divided into three words, and we followed this in recent chapters as a reminder that they’re the same people. Now, however, we will switch back to surname + first name (that is two words) style. Why the difference? Two words is the style used in mainland China when using pinyin. Three (sometimes four, I believe) words are used in places like Singapore. We have basically used the wrong style at the start.
