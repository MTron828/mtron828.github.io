3101 Rules of the Black Market

The man sneered, and said, “The black market only allows business. You are not allowed to use force. Do you want to die?”

Nie Yang couldn’t help but feel stifled.

After the development of the black market, there were all kinds of rules. Fighting and causing trouble were strictly prohibited. Anyone who disobeyed would be ganged up on by the masses.

Although Nie Yang was at Seven Meridians, and had a grandfather at Eleven Meridians, he didn’t dare to act so recklessly.

He could only hatefully pick up the bag on the ground. Since the other party knew that it was a Meridian Guiding Pill, it was clearly impossible for him to take it back.

“At least you know what’s good for you!” that person said coldly.

Ling Han took out a third bottle, and placed it in front of him.

“Hey, what kind of medicine is this?” the man asked.

“Meridian Guiding Pill.”

“Sell it to me!” That person was pleasantly surprised. It was only 150 jade seeds per pill. Even if he didn’t use it himself, he could still turn around and resell it for a high price.

What a fool. What a huge fool.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Each person is limited to a single purchase.”

“Hey, are you an idiot? In any case, you’re selling medicine. Isn’t it the same who you sell it to?” that person shouted.

Ling Han glanced at him, and said, “Since it’s my medicine, I can sell it to whomever I want. Do I need you to tell me what to do?”

“You…!!” That person was furious. He pointed at Ling Han, and couldn’t help but want to attack.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You dare to make a move here? Do you want to die?”

The man was stunned. These were the words that he had used with Nie Yang just now. He didn’t expect to receive retribution so quickly.

“Hahahaha!” Nie Yang burst into laughter. This was too satisfying.

That person looked at Ling Han coldly, and asked, “Are you really not selling?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You do indeed need medicine, but it’s not the Meridian Guiding Pill you need, but medicine for your ears. There’s obviously something wrong with your hearing.”

“There’s something wrong with his brain as well,” Nie Yang said unhurriedly as he added another stab.

That person trembled with anger, and said coldly, “Good, good, good. You’re really bold! I’ve already remembered your voice. As long as I find your voice somewhere else, I’ll teach you a lesson!”

Ling Han deliberately hugged himself. “I’m so scared!”

It had been many years since he had been threatened like this, and it gave him a sense of novelty.

“Just you wait!” That person turned around and left.

Ling Han shook his head. Both of them had only bought a Meridian Guiding Pill, but why was the difference between them so great?

“What? There’s a Meridian Guiding Pill here?” The commotion from before was a little loud, and it immediately attracted the attention of the people around them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sell it to me!”

“No, sell it to me!”

There was not enough to go around, which immediately caused a commotion.

“First come, first served. Each person is limited to buying one,” Ling Han said.

“I’m the first. I’m the first.”

Because the black market had its own rules, no one dared to mess around. These rules had been established for a long time, and no one dared to break them.

Therefore, although the Meridian Guiding Pill was very tempting, no one dared to break the rules, cut in line, or use force.

After selling a total of six bottles, Ling Han took out the seventh bottle, and said, “This is the last one.”

“I offer 160 jade seeds. Sell it to me!” Someone took the initiative to raise the price.

“I offer 170!”

“180!”

This seemed to have become an auction, and everyone raised their offers.

However, Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’ll sell as many of my medicines as I want. I won’t accept any bargaining, and I won’t raise the price, either.”

He sold the seventh Meridian Guiding Pill to the next person in line. 150 jade seeds—no more, no less.

Some people secretly called Ling Han a fool. Wasn’t this simply refusing money? However, some people admired Ling Han. In the present day, there were not many people who could adhere to their principles.

Ling Han dusted off his behind and stood up. He had already earned enough jade seeds, and it was time to spend them.

He scanned the stalls one after another. There were indeed many strange things here.

Most of them were damaged weapons. It was said that they had been dug out from ancient ruins and had once possessed immeasurable power. However, because they were damaged now, they could no longer unleash their power.

However, in terms of sharpness, they were much better than what the current craftsmanship could produce, and their sturdiness far exceeded that of Earth Element Iron.

Ling Han suppressed his curiosity; he wanted to find the Spirit Gathering Formation first.

If his own strength was insufficient, what would it matter if he had a powerful weapon?

Ling Han had always firmly believed that his own strength was the true path to take and the foundation for everything else.

There really was a Spirit Gathering Formation here, and Ling Han inquired about the price. The asking price was 20 jade seeds.

Was this cheap?

Not cheap at all.

One jade seed was enough to buy a slave. 20 jade seeds was definitely a huge sum of money. Moreover, this Spirit Gathering Formation only had seven formation foundations. As for the materials… They were extremely crude as they only had to be inscribed in ordinary steel.

However, it wasn’t as if there was nothing special about it. Ling Han could sense a faint energy emanating from the formation foundations and from the formation patterns carved in them.

According to the seller, each Spirit Gathering Formation could be used about three times before the formation foundations would collapse.

When using it, one had to fill in 10 to 100 jade seeds at a time. The more jade seeds there were, the better the effect.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and bought nine Spirit Gathering Formations. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to buy a few more, but that the seller only had nine available for sale.

The mission was completed, and Ling Han left.

He still had many jade seeds in his possession, but all of them needed to be used for cultivation. He couldn’t waste them.

After returning to the sect, he found a place to change his clothes before returning to his residence.

He rested for a short while, and then it was time that the sun rose.

Ling Han stood up and began to practice his fist techniques.

Huan Xue also woke up very early. She had to prepare breakfast for Ling Han.

After she was done, she went to the courtyard to watch Ling Han practice his fist techniques.

Half an hour later, Ling Han retracted his fists. The sun had already risen, and there was no longer any effect even if he continued practicing.

However, he still had the Spirit Gathering Formation.

Ling Han started to set up the formation foundations. When he saw Huan Xue standing at the side, he asked, “Huan Xue, do you want to cultivate?”

“Ah?” Huan Xue was stunned. At first, she revealed a look of longing. Then, she shook her head. “I’m not cut out for martial arts.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “As long as you have perseverance, determination, and a bit of luck, nothing is impossible.

“In the future, I’ll prepare a few Meridian Guiding Pills for you.”

“Thank you, Young Master,” Huan Xue said. However, she only thought that Ling Han had said it offhandedly to make her happy. What a joke. Meridian Guiding Pills were so precious that one was valuable enough to buy several of her.

Ling Han saw this, but did not say anything else. This girl did not know that he was the Alchemy Emperor. Refining pills? Heh, it was no big deal for him.

“Young Master, have some breakfast.”

Ling Han nodded. After breakfast, he activated the Spirit Gathering Formation and continued to practice his fist techniques.

Weng, the formation channeled, and the formation patterns on each formation foundation suddenly lit up. Meanwhile, the jade seeds beside the formation foundations began to emit a dense mist, as if they were burning.

This formation didn’t draw on the terrain or heaven’s might, so it didn’t need to be set up at a specific location. The energy used to power this formation came completely from the jade seeds.

Ling Han practiced his fist technique, and immediately felt another surge of power surge into his body.

Awesome!
