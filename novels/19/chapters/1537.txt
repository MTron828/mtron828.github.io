Chapter 1538 A torrent of abuse

This was very strange. In the desolate and cold galaxy, a man stood in your path, and hailed you down for a chat like he was your next door neighbor.

But this was the galaxy here!

A Saint from the Hu Clan, Ling Han immediately confirmed internally. Aside from this Forbidden Land that was expert in prediction, he did not offend any other Saints. If it was claimed that it just coincidentally happened to be some other Saint that had stopped him in his path on a paltry whim, he truly would not believe that.

He exited the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, and put the Cloud Piercing Shuttle away into the Black Tower with a wave of his right hand. Then, he looked at that young man. This man was really frighteningly young. His brimming vitality could not be faked. He was filled with youthful energy that seemed like it could tear a hole into the skies.

“From the Eight Stones Forbidden Land?” Ling Han asked. Since he had come to hunt him down, there was naturally no need for him to be polite.

He very much despised this kind of hypocritical and murderous character.

This young man naturally was Hu Feng. He was still smiling. With the lofty position of a Saint, especially one that had walked out from a Forbidden Land, he naturally would not take to heart the resistance of a mere ant.

However world-shakingly you were cursing, what person would take the mad chirping of a bird outside his window seriously?

He broke into a smile, and said, “Since you know that I have come from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, you must be the one I am looking for.” He paused, and continued, “My name is Hu Feng; you may address me directly by my name.”

This was really humility to a certain extent. A high and noble Saint actually allowed an Eternal River Tier to address him directly by name; just how amiable was he?

It was too deliberate; what a fake.

Ling Han shook his head internally. If the large black dog was here, he definitely would have innumerable negative and derisive words to spout. Too bad, this damn dog was glad to be in his proper surroundings in the academy, and simply did not leave with him.

Of course, Ling Han did not want to bring it along, either. Wasn’t that just looking for his own discomfort?

Ling Han smiled as well, and said, “My name is Ling Han. You, too, can address me directly by name.”

When Hu Feng heard this, a muscle involuntarily twitched in his cheek. He was a Saint, and if he allowed others to address him directly, that was him being humble and amiable. But even an Eternal River Tier like you dared act like that? F***!

‘I gave you an inch, and you plan to take a mile!’

His tone darkened, as he said, “You killed a member of our Hu Clan, and you think you can flee?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han smiled instead, and said, “I will try my best, and will absolutely not disappoint your expectations.

Hu Feng felt another muscle twitch in his cheek again. Those words from him were naturally filled with sarcasm, yet Ling Han actually answered him directly. ‘You think I hope that you can flee? Then what kind of trash would a Saint like me be, not being capable of apprehending even an Eternal River Tier?’

He was only wary that Ling Han still possessed the Saint King blood essence. Though he was sure that the latter should only have a single drop, and had already used it, it was best to be sure.

He was a very careful person.

There was no rush to make a move. Without the Saint King blood essence, where could he flee to?

“Just use whatever tricks you have,” Hu Feng stated calmly.

Ling Han had very sharp senses, and added with the fact that he had spent a long period of time with such great caustic characters like the large black dog, the old ginseng, and the rabbit, he was expertly skilled at grasping the hearts of others. He laughed, and said, “Though you put on a very amiable act, you are actually testing out the waters to see if I still have any Saint King blood essence. If I didn’t, you would probably immediately turn hostile, right?”

He had hit the nail on the head.

Hu Feng’s expression did not change. He still had that level of subtlety in him. Though he had been cultivating in the last millennia and more, he was naturally extremely intelligent and very strong in self-discipline to be able to advance into the Saint Tier so quickly.

He chuckled, and replied, “You are but a mere Eternal River Tier; what right do you have to act insolent in front of me?”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk.” Ling Han shook his head, “If I have to be honest, you are simply cheap! Your own clan’s senior has been killed by my hand, and you f******* still act so friendly. F***, I have never seen trash like you! If you had been my grandson, I would have broken your wretched leg a long time ago!”

This, this, this, this...!

Hu Feng was dumbfounded. This ant actually dared to hurl abuse at him! Cheap? Trash? Wretched leg? No matter how well he could act, he would not be able to tolerate that. If he could still bear having someone point directly at his nose and throw insults at him, wouldn’t he be a tortoise!

“How dare you!” Finally, he could not hold back from moving; even his expression was slightly twisted in livid fury.

If anyone from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land was here, they definitely would be filled with disbelief. That was because Hu Feng had lacked youthful temper since childhood, and had been called an “immovable boulder”. Even if the heavens collapsed in front of him, his expression would not change. When they had been playing when they were children, even if someone had snatched his toy away, he would not even cry or make a fuss.

But now, even the boulder had been angered, and lost all his composure. This was practically unimaginable!

As the saying goes, one would be the product of his environment. Who were those beside Ling Han? They were beings like the large black dog, the old ginseng, and the rabbit—if one stayed long enough with them, and they were really intent on angering you, they definitely were capable of driving you to mad fury.

Ling Han had already channelled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Boom, when this strike landed, he was sent flying thousands of miles away. The galaxy did not form any kind of resistance for him. If he had not taken the initiative to stop, he could continue to fly all the way, and would only stop when he crashed into some meteor or star.

“En?” Hu Feng was involuntarily stunned. This man actually managed to endure a blow from him?

This was nature-defying! This was nature-defying!

The Star Sand Saint had only said that Ling Han killed Hu Yingmu by channeling a drop of Star Sand Saint King blood essence, and concealed that wager that had been previously made. Thus, neither Hu Feng nor Hu Yingmu knew what terrifying height Ling Han’s defenses could attain.

This definitely was not the might of a Tool, but the ability of this person himself.

What kind of cultivation technique was this?

Hu Feng’s eyes abruptly lit up. As the prodigy of a Forbidden Land, he naturally knew a great turmoil had Eight Stones Tribe leaving the Celestial Realm.

But in comparison, the Eight Stones Tribe could not be considered as top tier among those forces that had been exiled. It was said that there were even Celestial Kings that had died in that kind of war. The Heavenly River King had obtained this kind of inheritance, and that was why he managed to rise up in such a short period of time, and became able to challenge the Forbidden Lands.

This brat had to have obtained the treasures that the Heavenly River King had left behind. In fact, he had already successfully cultivated the techniques from within. Otherwise, how could he possibly be capable of blocking the blow from a Saint?

Immediately, his greed blazed. He made another move, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han could not dodge, and could only channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to endure another strike. Boom, golden light emanated from his whole body, and he was like an undefeatable war god. He again successfully blocked this blow. He gritted his teeth internally. This Hu Feng was even more powerful than Hu Yingmu. He had only suffered two blows, and the Origin Power inside his body was already completely exhausted.

He laughed loudly. “What Eight Stones Forbidden Land, what damn Saint, you can only do so much! Little Feng, I’m not going to stay around to play with you. Next time, I will come again to teach you a lesson.”

As he said this, he directly entered into the Black Tower.

The moment he entered into the Black Tower, he flopped onto the ground, gasping out in pain.

Hu Feng’s second strike had still caused him some level of damage, causing even his Godly bones to crackle and pop as if they were about to break.

“Going by the look of things, I may not be able to take a full-power blow from a Great Saint.” Ling Han sighed. The so-called strike from a Saint was only limited to a Medium Saint.

The Heavenly Body Tier corresponded to a Small Saint, whereas the Eternal River Tier corresponded to Medium Saint.

If that kind of complaint was heard by others, they would definitely be strangling him in fury. F***, aside from a freak like you, what Eternal River Tier in this whole world could survive a blow from a Saint?
