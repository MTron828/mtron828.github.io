Chapter 1251: The Stronger the Enemy, the Stronger I Will Be

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han involuntarily laughed. In this world, there did not exist one person in the same cultivation level that could kill him within three moves.

This Ao Ziyun was only in the low extreme, and his aura was slightly stronger than Ling Han’s, so he was either in the late stage or the peak stage.

“You are very confident. Only stepping on those like you is interesting,” Ling Han said.

Ao Ziyun coldly replied, “Humph, even if you do not die within three moves, I will still teach you a lesson!” He had been enraged by Ling Han. The latter actually said he wanted to step on him. Did he even know what his status as a prince of the Black Dragon Race represented?

He moved, and delivered a palm strike. A humongous black dragon’s claw immediately descended from the skies, pressing down on Ling Han. Weng, weng, weng. Multiple divine patterns appeared, interweaving into frightening black flames.

Black dragons were skilled in using fire. This was a supreme divine flame, and would be able to burn anything.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. He was a descendant of the True Dragon?

Powerful, he was indeed very powerful!

He had a feeling that if he allowed the other to burn him like this, even one with a physique like his would be forcefully turned to ashes. Of course, this was definitely not something that could be accomplished in a short while. No matter what, it would have to take 10-15 days.

However, it was still capable of doing so, after all.

For example, if there were a few more people with considerable abilities to entrap him, then these black flames would be greatly effective.

Indeed, he could not underestimate the people in this world!

Ling Han flicked a finger, and used the Lightning Sword Technique. Xiu, xiu, xiu. Immediately, Sword Qi swept forth, sweeping out towards that dragon claw.

Pu, pu, pu, pu. Sword Qi swept over madly, and cracks rapidly appeared on that claw. Then, it collapsed, being forcefully shattered.

Ao Ziyun couldn’t help but be slightly surprised, and said, “I had not thought that you would really have some ability!”

“Hehe, if I didn’t have a bit of ability, I would not dare to roam around here,” Ling Han replied calmly.

Realization dawned on Ao Ziyun, and he asked, “You are also here to participate in the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering?”

‘What Two Realm Prodigy Gathering?’ Ling Han muttered internally, yet showed nothing of his thoughts on his face, and asked, “You as well?”

“Of course. If I am unqualified, who else would be?” Ao Ziyun asked proudly.

“I forgot to tell you, I rather dislike arrogant people like you,” Ling Han said.

“So what about it?” Ao Ziyun smirked coldly. “Then just let me first test the waters, and check whether you are qualified to participate or not!”

He moved once more, attacking Ling Han again. It was still another palm strike that had turned into a dragon claw. However, this time, the whole claw was entwined with black flames, and it was like a monster that had been nurtured by the heaven and earth, ready to destroy this world.

Ling Han breathed in a mouthful of air, and then suddenly blew it out.

Hu, a wild gust of wind blew, sweeping over that dragon claw. Instantly, the fierce flames were forcefully extinguished, only leaving behind a barren dragon claw that was still determinedly pressing downwards. However, the power of the attack had lessened greatly, and it no longer posed a threat.

Involuntarily, a muscle twitched in Ao Ziyun’s cheek. ‘You did that on purpose, didn’t you? And you call me arrogant? You blew out a breath of air and easily extinguished my divine flames, so aren’t you even more arrogant?’

However, this brat really could not be underestimated. That black flame was his bloodline talent, and added with the fact that he had fused in Regulations of the heaven and earth, it should not be something that could be blocked by someone who was only in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

It should be known that he was a cultivator of the Netherworld Realm that could kill a great many in the high extreme of Sun Moon Tier with his black flames. All of them were unable to fight off the might of the black flames. He had not thought that they would instead be blocked by someone who was similarly in the low extreme.

He was matched by one in the same cultivation level. What did that mean?

That the other was also a king tier!

A powerful fighting spirit rose up in Ao Ziyun. His cultivation level was actually higher than Ling Han’s as he was in the peak stage of the low extreme. If he could not very quickly suppress this opponent, then wouldn’t that mean he was inferior to him?

“Humph, how could there possibly be geniuses in the Immortal Realm that could equal me?” he said, smirking coldly. He leaped up and charged out. This time, he had gotten serious. A black dragon was soaring furiously behind him, boosting his aura incredibly.

Hong, he stimulated a burning black cloud. Wherever it passed, the ground would be burnt to the point of cracking. The rocks that protruded would be turned into nothing.

Ling Han was unafraid. He used the Star Plucking Step and headed towards the other party. As he shot out a fist, it brought supreme forcefulness with it. ‘Who cares if you are a dragon or a worm? In front of me, you would only be suppressed.’

Peng, peng, peng, peng! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two clashed. Two fists endlessly crashed into each other, every impact causing the whole heaven and earth to pale in color.

They were obviously merely in the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier, yet this might would make one suspect that this was actually the deadly clash between two great elites of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Little Han, use more force. Shatter every bone in this brat’s body, and we’ll be feasting on dragon ribs today!”

“Grandpa Ginseng is already craving for food, wanting to drink the ****** fresh blood of the Netherworld jerk!”

Rabbit and the old ginseng cheered on Ling Han from the sidelines, yet these two guys were really horrible, their words extremely insulting.

Ao Ziyun was both shocked and furious.

As an elite, he was naturally capable of listening in on all directions even in the midst of battle. The old ginseng’s and Rabbit’s words naturally did not escape his ears. They actually said they wanted to dine on his dragon ribs? This bunch was really detestable.

Yet Ling Han’s abilities also stunned him.

In the Two Realm Battlefield, the Regulations were extremely muddled because of the clash between the two Realms, and would cause a cultivator’s battle prowess to fall greatly. Yet this kind of weakening ability applied to both sides. If I became weaker, so would you. Furthermore, in this place, the Regulations of the Netherworld should be slightly stronger. In theory, he should be slightly better off than Ling Han in being weakened.

Yet the two of them were actually tied!

He was obviously two sub-minor levels higher than the other. This was suppression on the level of two stars of power. Furthermore, he was at an advantage in terms of location as well, and even then, they were at a draw. Then if this had been a place where the Regulations of the two Realms were equal, wouldn’t he have lost?

Yet he did not know that Ling Han possessed Demonic Essence, and could adapt to the Regulations of both Realms, and was not the slightest bit weakened. The one at a disadvantage was actually just himself, but because he did not know, he couldn’t help but be filled with a powerful wariness of Ling Han.

How was this being from the Immortal Realm so freakish? He was actually able to fight himself to a draw even with the power gap of two stars between them?

It should be known that he was also a super genius that had cultivated the Mountain River Tier to the true pinnacle.

“Quite strong, but still not enough!” Ao Ziyun was naturally not about to give up so easily. With a loud shout, he no longer stuck to competing with Ling Han in mere strength, but rather used a secret technique, causing his battle prowess to spike madly.

Ling Han countered each move using his fingers like a sword, and used the Lightning Sword Technique. Sword Qi danced, both fast and vicious.

You were strong, but so was I. It was really hard to decide who was stronger between the two of them.

Not just Ao Ziyun was stunned, even Ling Han himself felt secretly rueful. There were indeed innumerable prodigies in this world. It should be known that this was only a passageway of the two realms, and in the Immortal Realm, there were uncountable such passageways.

If he encountered this kind of genius in any Two Realm Battlefield, then how many prodigies would there be in the entire Netherworld?

However, in a battle of equal levels, he was the true invincible one!

Ling Han was filled with confidence because his biggest strength was his spirit and physique, and it was still far from the point when they would be clashing in these two areas. The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll should be the highest level secret technique in the Celestial Realm. He had been forcefully instilled with power from the Black Tower, and had thus slowly mastered it comprehensively. He absolutely did not believe that there was any technique that could match it in the Immortal Realm.

“Dragon’s might!” Ao Ziyun exclaimed. Weng, the image of the black dragon behind him instantly exuded a terrifying might. Even those in the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier would possibly feel a coldness from this might, thus causing their battle prowess to greatly decline.
