When he touched on the subject of the Shattering Void Tier, Na Zhi Yan seemed to have regained his confidence. He said, “Human Race’s Sir, even if your battle prowess is monstrous, you are still only in the Flower Blossom Tier after all. There is no way that you would be able to match the Sea Race of our Northern Sea. Furthermore, I am under the command of a lord from one of the general clans to come here to retrieve an ancient object. I shall leave upon retrieving it. Us members of the Sea Race dislike land, and will definitely not invade the land masses.”

These words were quite believable. At least, Ling Han had never heard of the Sea Race in his last life. Obviously, they each minded their own business, and did not make any attempts to trespass onto each other’s territory.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Has your brain been kicked by a donkey? In the territory of our Human Race, you still ask me not to meddle in the business of others?”

Na Zhi Yan instantly felt cold. It was one thing how powerful the Sea Race was; the problem now was that he had fallen into Ling Han’s hands, and whether he lived or died was completely at the latter’s whim. He quickly said, “I know my mistake. I know my mistake.”

What a humiliation; an elite of the Flower Blossom Tier would actually act so humble.

Though people could not hear what Ling Han and Na Zhi Yan said, simply looking at the submissive, servile display that Na Zhi Yan was putting on, they were aware that he now wanted nothing more than to lick Ling Han’s shoes.

Disdainful!

“General clan, those that have Heaven Tier cultivators?” Ling Han rubbed his chin, then asked curiously, “Since your Sea Race is so powerful, why did they send someone like you?”

Na Zhi Yan was feeling very depressed. The martial arts level of this Desolate North was not that high; even “someone like him” should be strong enough to do as he liked. He said, “I am one of the Sea Demon Race, and am naturally proficient at bewitching. That lord from the general clan has no desire to create any great uproar, because that mineshaft is too strange. If there were many members of the Sea Race who died there, it may even attract the attention of the Royal Clan.”

“Then what exactly is the object that you seek?” Ling Han asked.

Na Zhi Yan hesitated slightly, then said, “It is said to be a vial, but I am not very sure.”

“What is it used for?”

“I don’t know, either. All I know is that the lord values it very much and has commanded me to do things quietly, but I must definitely obtain that vial.”

“Is the way you do things considered quiet?” Ling Han humphed, but when he thought about it, there was no communication between the seas and land—no matter how many people died on land, what relation did it have with the Sea Race? They would not care at all, so in this aspect, Na Zhi Yan had really been doing things quietly.

“Sir...” Na Zhi Yan said pitifully. His battle prowess was definitely considered top-tier in the Desolate North, but among the Sea Race, he could only be barely considered a strong cultivator. Thus, he did not have that kind of powerful aura, nor did he have the unyielding personality of a true elite cultivator.

In other words, he was soft.

Ling Han gave it some thought, then said, “You stay here with me for a while!” He knocked Na Zhi Yan unconscious with a single palm strike, then withdrew him into the Black Tower.

Because of this member of the Sea Race, who knew how many humans had died? Ling Han naturally would not let him go so easily. However, he still wanted to ask Na Zhi Yan for some more information about the Sea Race, and thus had no plans to kill the latter as of this moment.

Seeing a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator so easily dealt with by Ling Han, everyone’s hearts were filled with anxiety. If Ling Han wanted to kill them, that would merely be as easy as flipping his hand over. Flower Blossom Tier cultivators had transcended mortality, and were inconceivably powerful.

Ling Han looked at Bo Wen Lin, smiled, and said, “Master Bo—”

“No! No!” Bo Wen Lin waved his hands quickly. If he was actually addressed by an elite cultivator of Flower Blossom Tier cultivator as Master, that was obviously like grilling him on top of an open fire.

Ling Han said in displeasure, “Master Bo seems to like cutting off the words of others.”

Bo We Lin really felt like dying. He simply did not want Ling Han to address him respectfully; what did he do wrong again? But when Ling Han said that, how could he dare to talk back? He merely shut his mouth obediently.

“Come with me to see the Fire Emperor,” Ling Han said, smiling.

Bo Wen Lin instantly hesitated. ‘It can’t be that you’re in the mood for some murder and want to kill even the Fire Emperor, right?’

“Yi, didn’t Master Bo say that you would follow me wherever I go? I remember very distinctly those were your exact words,” Ling Han said, smiling. “The thing I hate most is those who go back on their words. Do you want me to hate you?”

Hu Niu bared her teeth, killing intent soaring. Whomever Ling Han hated, she was very willing to use her little fists to smash him into pieces.

With two Flower Blossom Tier cultivators staring at him, what else could Bo Wen Lin say? He could only say, “I am willing to go with you, Sir!”

Ling Han smiled, then said, “Let’s go then.”

After the three of them left, the others finally gasped in relief. All of them could feel a layer of cold sweat on their backs. The pressure exuded by Flower Blossom Tier cultivators was really too terrifying; such beings were on a completely different level from them.

“That powerful cultivator seems to be deliberately picking on Bo Wen Lin; how did Old Nine of the Bo Clan offend him?”

“That can’t be, right? If he really committed an offense, that elite cultivator needs only a finger to squish him to mush.”

“I know, Bo Wen Lin’s son had previously made a move against that elite cultivator, yet was killed in the process. Old Nine of the Bo Clan would naturally not let things slide, so he ran over to hunt down the elite cultivator, which is what led to the events after.”

“I see!”

“Looks like we all have to discipline the juniors in our own clans so that they won’t inexplicably offend a powerful cultivator. That could really lead to death and ruin for the whole clan!”

“That’s right!”

They all sighed ruefully, and Ling Han had succeeded in his scheme. He was not simply torturing Bo Wen Lin for fun, but was also using him to set an example so that these great clans that were used to being arrogant and condescending reflected on themselves and their own actions.

In the wider world, there would always be someone stronger and more talented than themselves, so they should not be too arrogant in their ways.

Getting back to the subject, Ling Han and the others were heading towards the Imperial Palace. They did not walk too fast, so by the time they arrived at the Imperial Palace, the entire Imperial Palace had entered into a state of emergency. There was a terrifying array already activated, as if they were prepared to face some great enemy.

“Halt!” someone yelled loudly. “This is an important place of Fire Country, and it is forbidden for outsiders to enter!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I have something to say to the Fire Emperor. Tell him to come out, and we can all speak peacefully. Don’t make me resort to force. In truth, I am one who dislikes using force and violence very much.”

The corner of Bo Wen Lin’s mouth twitched involuntarily, and he secretly mocked in his heart, ‘Then who was that guy whose motto was ‘to use violence to enforce submission’?’

“Leave immediately.” Another voice transmitted from the Imperial Palace. Now, everyone was well aware of how powerful Ling Han was. Who would dare shut down the protective array? Without the defenses provided by the array technique, how could they be able to stop an elite Flower Blossom Tier cultivator? Even if that old emperor of Fire Country came, there was still a chance he might not be able to protect all of them.

Ling Han clapped a hand onto Bo Wen Lin’s shoulder, smiled, and said, “Do you all recognize this person? I will give you the time for ten breaths, and if I still do not see the Rain Emperor by then, I will kill this guy.”

Bo Wen Lin instantly shivered. How could the Fire Emperor possibly risk his life and appear for his sake? He was definitely going to die.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I am only joking around with them.”

Bo Wen Lin sighed in relef, thinking, ‘I am really going to be broken from being played around by this guy.’

“I will only cripple your four limbs,” Ling Han continued.

“Ah!” Bo Wen Lin was again scared, and could not help but shudder again.

“Ai, you really don’t know how to appreciate jokes. Forget it, I won’t tease you anymore. It would be better if I just went straight ahead to break through the array technique and met the Fire Emperor directly.” Ling Han looked ahead, activating the Eye of Truth. He began to observe this array technique in search for any weak points.

By now, he was at least a Fifth Tier Array Technique Master. It was not possible for him to lay out a Sixth Tier array technique now, but if it was merely to unravel one, it would be a piece of cake. After all, there was no one disturbing him now, so he could proceed with a calm and serene mindset.
