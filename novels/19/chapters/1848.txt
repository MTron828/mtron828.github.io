Chapter 1849: I’m a very easygoing person

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “Don’t misunderstand. I am only passing by, and have not seen anyone. I will leave once I’m finished eating.”

Lu Xianming smirked coldly, and said, “Since you are so stubborn... apprehend him!”

He still wanted to find out what had happened to his subordinate. Thus, he did not issue the command to kill Ling Han.

“Yes!” The seven subordinates obeyed, immediately moving to surround Ling Han.

Ling Han continued to eat, and said, “I really have no malicious intent. Your person may have seen a pretty girl pass by, and thus followed her. What does it have to do with me?”

“Don’t be so flippant!” The seven people charged over, all drawing their weapons, and blazing with killing intent. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han was completely unconcerned. These people were all only in the Severing Mundane Tier. To say nothing of the fact that they were only normal severances, even if they were king tiers, or even emperor tiers, he would not be afraid in the slightest.

The seven people besieged him, while Ling Han only dodged. After all, he had eaten their food, so he had to give them some courtesy. Furthermore, he also discovered that he had been screwed over by someone else.

Chen Si must have been killed—even if he hadn’t died, he would not have been much better off, either. That was why he could easily make his way here, but the culprit clearly did not bear any good intentions towards Lu Xianming. He had deliberately allowed him to come here, so his motive could not be any clearer.

He was bait, used to attract the attention of these seven guards, and as for later...

Xiu!

A flash of sword light suddenly rose up from under the ground, lifting Sword Qi that was a whole 3,000 meters long. A murderous aura spread out, as if a prehistoric wild beast was born.

This was an assassin who had used an unknown method to approach. Even Ling Han had not discovered that he had been lying in ambush all the while here, and the other party had taken this prime opportunity to unleash an attack.

Lu Xianming humphed, his expression showing his thoughts—”as expected”.

One was in the open to draw attention, while the other would be launching a sneak attack from the shadows. Did they think such tricks could fool him?

Shua

, a sword slashed over. There were multiple deep green patterns on the sword’s blade. That had been soaked in strong poison, and were about to become symbols of great dao. To say nothing of an open wound, even mere contact with the skin would be deadly.

Lu Xianming made his move. With a clink, a crescent blade had appeared in his hands, and blocked this blow. A strong clash of Regulations took place, and they instantly swept out wildly towards the surroundings like a tsunami.

Teng, teng, teng. Lu Xianming couldn’t help but retreat continuously. The other’s battle prowess was very strong. At least, he was not much inferior to himself.

Just at this moment, shua, another flash of sword light actually shot out from the ground. A figure also appeared behind it, controlling its blade to pierce Lu Xianming’s back.

This blow was really very timely and on the spot. This was precisely the instant when Lu Xianming’s defenses were at their weakest.

“Humph!” Yet Lu Xianming was completely unruffled. With a point of his right hand, weng, an aura of light immediately appeared, forming a shield around him.

Peng!

When the sword light arrived, it was blocked by the shield of light, but as the second sneak attacker shouted a battle cry, the sneak attack’s power instantly soared 100 times over. Innumerable cracks appeared on the shield of light, and then it shattered and crumbled.

“Scram!” Lu Xianming had already gotten his breath back, and the crescent blade in his hand struck out.

The second sneak attacker’s feet tapped lightly on the ground, and his figure retreated, dodging this blow.

Shua, a third flash of sword light rose up, and this time, it had shot out from Lu Xianming’s left side. A third sneak attacker popped out.

This time, Lu Xianming’s expression really changed.

One time, two times, and now three was his limit. Though the last two sneak attacks seemed to have taken a long time, they had actually happened at almost the same time. Even if Lu Xianming was a prodigy of cultivation, he had still used up all his tricks in the face of these two sharp sneak attacks.

And now, his Origin Power had not recovered yet, while his protective measures were used up, but a fatal blade was again piercing towards him.

He knew what kind of sword this was. “Shattering Spirit Herb” was rubbed on the blades, and if one was stabbed with it, not only would the physical body be destroyed, even the spirit would in fact be immediately corroded. It really was incredibly vicious.

Was there no way for him to escape from this crisis?

Looking at the blazing sword light, and how it had arrived at his chest, a bitter feeling rose up in Lu Xianming’s heart.

‘Coming from the same roots, why are you in such a rush to kill me?’

“Hey, hey, hey. You guys can go ahead and kill each, and I won’t care about that, but don’t use me like a shield to bear the blame for you guys.” With a flash, Ling Han had already stepped in front of Lu Xianming, and stretched out a hand to grab the poisoned sword.

“Don’t touch it, there’s poison!” Lu Xianming hurriedly communicated this message through divine sense. Verbal communication clearly wouldn’t make it in time.

Ling Han merely acted as if he had not heard. Pa, he had grabbed the sword’s blade in one go, and said, “I’m talking to you here! Don’t you know that it is very impolite to ignore the questions of others, especially when this person is your victim at that!”

“Die!” The third sneak attacker’s eyes flickered with viciousness. ‘To actually grab the poisoned sword with a bare hand, you clearly are dead!’

Who asked you to insist on barging in and ruining their business? Just as it looked like their target was about to be killed, but someone actually came in and interfered. If they didn’t kill you, how were they supposed to vent their hatred?

“Kill!” The other two sneak attackers also returned in attack. All of them were filled with anger towards Ling Han. Initially, this was a perfectly flawless assassination, but now all their efforts had come to nothing just because of an outsider.

If they had known that this would have been the result, they really wouldn’t have used him as bait.

The seven guards immediately charged back after a moment of being stunned. This time, they naturally were not charging towards Ling Han.

“You, how... how are you completely fine!” The third sneak attacker stared at Ling Han dumbly. ‘Are you a monster? Your bare hand is holding a poisoned sword, and you are actually completely unscathed.’

Ling Han wore a strange expression, and countered, “Why wouldn’t I be completely fine? Do you know how to chat here? Cursing someone with death the moment you open your mouth, nobody does that.”

‘Holy! F*ck!’ The third sneak attacker was about to go crazy. How could there be someone like this? ‘Are you an idiot?’

He hurriedly pulled his sword and retreated. There was no point to drag things out with this weirdo. The priority here was Lu Xianming, Lu Xianming!

Ling Han’s hand burned with the Nine Heavens Flame. This was Celestial King Tier-level entity, and with the support of such great dao, how could the poison possibly infiltrate his body?

He gripped the sword, as immovable as a mountain, so how could the other man manage to draw his sword back?

“Hey, don’t be so excited. Just see how I, the victim, aren’t excited, so I have no idea what you are so anxious about.” Ling Han appeared calm and unruffled. “Come, give me an explanation. Why did you throw the blame on me? Is it because you thought that I am an easy target to bully?”

‘You are an easy target to bully? Easy to bully my as*!’

The third sneak attack presently really wanted to cry but had no tears. They really shouldn’t have trifled with Ling Han. This was essentially a maniac, and was a maniac that was incredibly strong at that.

The battle royale began. The two sneak attackers stood against the seven guards. Putting aside the matter of the art of assassination, these two sneak attackers really weren’t all that strong. Their strength lay in unleashing a deadly blow once they had snuck near enough to their target.

Once it became a head-on confrontation, their strength was just that.

Lu Xianming did not make a move. He merely watched that farce-like conversation between Ling Han and the third attacker,

“I am a very easygoing person. As long as you compensate me with something like Godly metal—of course, it has to be Level 20; I will also accept Pseudo-Divine Metal—then I can write off what happened just now,” Ling Han said with utmost seriousness.

“My dear friend, help me apprehend these three people, and I will offer you a satisfactory payment.” Lu Xianming suddenly spoke up.

“No, no, no, we, too, will be willing to make an offer!” The third sneak attacker hurriedly called out. He already had a deep understanding of Ling Han’s strength. Merely the magnificent feat of him grabbing the poisoned blade with his bare hand had already scared him out of his wits.
