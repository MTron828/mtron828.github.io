Chapter 2264: Appearance of the Imperial Void Celestial King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

That Ascending Origin Tier elite brought Ling Han to a large palace.

This great palace was really too majestic, with Light of Dao enshrouding it, and emanating an air of utter dominance.

Ling Han was sure that this great hall had to be a precious treasure.

He channeled the Heaven Deceiving Technique, concealing his own aura. More importantly, it was to conceal the existence of the Black Tower. There were a great many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings here.

Led by that Ascending Origin Tier, Ling Han entered into the great palace.

When they arrived here, the back of that Ascending Origin Tier elite involuntarily bent as he revealed a cautious look, seeming like he did not even dare to breathe too heavily.

This was natural. There were many Celestial Kings seated in the great palace, and several Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were seated loftily on the other end of the great palace, as if they were immortal gods.

“Han Lin, you have accomplished great service for the Celestial Realm!” The Eternity Celestial King spoke first, his voice resounding strongly, and possessing supreme austerity.

This was his true self. What had appeared at the Saintly Origin Academy was merely a sliver of divine sense from him, a manifestation, and could not be compared with his true self at all.

Ling Han appeared extremely modest, and bowed slightly towards the Eternity Celestial King. “Thank you for your praise, Lord Eternity.”

“It is indeed a merit that will not be erased for ages,” another Celestial King said. All those that could speak at this moment had to be Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Her title was Thousand Words, and she was one of the rarer female Celestial Kings.

“Hehe, the saying is true. Throughout history, heroes have emerged from the youth.” A Celestial King dressed in Dao robes stroked his beard and smiled slightly. His title was Cloud Void, and he naturally was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

The Celestial Kings were not stingy with their praise. Aside from the fact that Ling Han had killed a great many elites from the Foreign Realm, his own natural talent of cultivation was also extremely valued by the Celestial Kings.

“I propose that we nurture this boy as much as possible,” the Eternity Celestial King said. He had a very high opinion of Ling Han, “With the natural talent of this boy, added with the Eternity Celestial King, it is possible that he could surpass the limitations of the Regulations, and become a Heavenly Venerate.”

Heavenly Venerate!

The Celestial Kings all looked solemn. This was an existence that was superior to Regulations. Even in the entirety of the Celestial Realm, there were only three such overlords.

“I agree,” the Everlasting Youth Celestial King immediately said. He was close friends with the Eternity Celestial King.

“I agree as well.” The Treading Clouds Celestial King expressed her own stand as well.

“I disagree!” Right at this moment, a figure appeared at the doorway of the palace, casting a long shadow, and emanating a boundless pressure on the Celestial Kings.

“Imperial Void!” The Eternity Celestial King’s eyes narrowed as he spat out these words.

Instantly, Ling Han’s heart jolted as he looked towards this person.

This was a youth, who looked to be no more but 16 or 17 years old, but his sideburns were already snow-white, revealing an air of age. He was clearly just one person, but standing there, he was like an immovable god that no one could possibly surpass.

Powerful, extremely powerful!

Ling Han had a feeling that even if he was still in the neutral zone, it would not be easy for him to kill this person. This was an instinct that could not be described, but Ling Han was absolutely certain about it.

The Imperial Void Celestial King, an overlord among the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, an existence that could definitely be ranked into the top 10, or even the top three.

Small Tower had once said that when the Imperial Void had been in Severing Mundane Tier, he had repeatedly crippled his own cultivation level and started again, right until he could deliver no more strikes to the heaven and earth, and only then did he advance into the Dividing Soul Tier.

This kind of being was probably endlessly close to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

No, no, no. There was still a very large gap between him and the Heavenly Venerable Tier, Ling Han immediately corrected mentally, but the latter was truly just a step away from Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Even Celestial Kings like Eternity Celestial King would probably not last 100 moves against him.

This was the personal disciple of a Heavenly Venerate, and was extraordinarily powerful.

“What do you mean?” the Everlasting Youth Celestial King asked.

The Imperial Void Celestial King strode in, a frightening aura surging out. All the Celestial Kings in the palace were intimidated by him, and actually fell completely silent. He stated calmly, “I think that this boy should hand over the Origin Magic Cube!”

When these words fell, all the Celestial Kings immediately rose in a storm of protest.

It could be said that Ling Han had performed a great service for the Celestial Realm, but the first words from the Imperial Void Celestial King were actually to demand that Ling Han’s strongest treasure was to be taken from him. Wouldn’t this just be bitterly disappointing the rest?

If they acted in such a manner, who would still be willing to work for the Celestial Realm?

The Imperial Void Celestial King continued, “I have already touched the edges of the Heavenly Venerable Tier. I have certainty that if I had the Origin Magic Cube, I could break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier within the next 100 million years.” He paused, and then continued, “If I become a Heavenly Venerate, I will definitely be able to push our enemies out of our borders, and guarantee that the Celestial Realm will be safe for millions and millions of epochs.

“Tell me, does the slightest bit of selfishness underlie my actions?”

Ling Han was speechless for a while. The Imperial Void Celestial King clearly wanted to take the Origin Magic Cube for his own, yet still spoke of it in such a grand, noble manner, as if his cause was just and righteous. It had definitely surpassed the upper limits of shamelessness.

The Celestial Kings exchanged looks, appearing very hesitant.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was an absolute prodigy in his youth, leading a whole era. Just the fact that he had delivered strikes to the heaven and earth until he could not anymore in the Severing Mundane Tier was a clear show of some traces of his freakish genius.

Furthermore, when he advanced into the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, he had also become the highest grade of elite. There were at most only 10 that could be his equal, and he could even rank in the top three; his superior strength truly shook the past and shone in the present.

If it had to be said that there was anyone in this world that would be most qualified to become the next Heavenly Venerate, the Imperial Void Celestial King was definitely one of them.

To be honest, after the Imperial Void Celestial King obtained the Origin Magic Cube, how high would be his chances of advancing into the Heavenly Venerable Tier? Probably very high. This kind of existence was really just a line’s breadth away from the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and the Origin Magic Cube was the stepping stone that could push open the doors to this final stage.

The importance of a Heavenly Venerate was really much, much too great. The reason why Clear Heaven Pass had been guarded with such difficulty was because they did not have a Heavenly Venerable Tier standing guard here. Otherwise, there would be endless Regulations they could channel, and even if the Celestial Realm’s side only had a single Heavenly Venerate, he could be treated like three, five, or even 10 Celestial Kings.

‘If the Imperial Void becomes a Heavenly Venerate..’ everyone thought, ‘it would only need 100,000,000 years, and the situation of the Celestial Realm would be improved by an unknown number of times.’

With such thoughts, quite a number of Celestial Kings were moved. As they saw it, the importance of the Celestial Realm naturally far surpassed the benefits of one or two people.

The Imperial Void Celestial King turned to Ling Han again, and said, “Youth, hand over the Origin Magic Cube. I will not mistreat you, and I will take you as a disciple. In the future, it is not impossible that you, too, would be able to touch the borders of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han smirked coldly. He had long since had a stomach full of anger, and it finally exploded as he demanded, “Dare I ask Lord Imperial Void, where is your master?”

The master of the Imperial Void Celestial King was naturally the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, and Ling Han’s words were very direct in meaning—it was not that the Celestial Realm did not have any Heavenly Venerates. Your master was one, but had he stepped forward and done anything for the sake of the Celestial Realm?

Even if you became a Heavenly Venerate, so what? Would you really work for the benefit of the Celestial Realm?

If there was only one Heavenly Venerate, without great determination, would you be able to block the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm that numbered at least in the dozens?

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had become a coward, so how could Ling Han trust that the Imperial Void Celestial King would be an exception?

That was right. Ling Han had complete confidence in himself, and was certain that even if he did not have the Origin Magic Cube, he would still be capable of becoming a Heavenly Venerate, though it was possible that the process would be more complicated and troublesome. Hence, he could afford to let go of the Origin Magic Cube.

The problem here was there was absolutely no way he was going to hand it over to the Imperial Void Celestial King.

The Imperial Void Celestial King actually did not get angered, but instead smiled. “Youth, you are really quite brave! However, whatever I want, there has never been anyone that can refuse me!”

He moved directly, grabbing out at Ling Han.
