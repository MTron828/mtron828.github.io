2704 The Azure Ghost Celestial King appears

On a matter of great principles, the top-tier prodigies all knew their priorities.

It was like that for Xiao Yingxiong, and so would it be for Du Shiyi.

However, after Ling Han was discovered, three of the people that had been pursuing Du Shiyi immediately broke off from the rest, and began to set out in pursuit of Ling Han.

Du Shiyi was anxious. He knew that Ling Han was very freakish, but without reaching the Ninth Heaven, there was no possible way he could match Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tiers, but how could it be that he could still turn around to save Ling Han?

He could only deliver a strike, which streaked towards those three people that had split from the rest, trying to create an opportunity for Ling Han to escape.

Out of the three people that had split from the rest, one of them just happened to be the Azure Ghost Celestial King. He sent out a palm strike, and pa! Du Shiyi’s attack was immediately and very easily destroyed.

This was the strength of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed slightly. Though the Azure Ghost Celestial King had presently advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, his battle prowess was not much stronger than a peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier’s.

He had indeed been tempered by the fundamental power of the Genesis World, but the volume seemed to be especially little. Thus, in terms of Body Art, he had only attained the height of Regulations. However, with the combined power of Body Art and Regulations, his battle prowess naturally would have increased as well.

This kind of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could only be considered as someone who’d just newly crossed over into this threshold.

‘En, I myself would be able to fight 10 of such Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates alone,’ Ling Han thought. Then, he sent a message to Du Shiyi. “Brother Du, come towards me.”

‘Come towards you for what? Do you think that two, no, four people would be able to match these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates?’ Du Shiyi, too, knew that these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could only be considered to be at the lowest tier of this cultivation level, but even if they were at the bottom, they were still Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. Furthermore, they had an advantage in numbers as well, so they definitely could not be opposed with brute power.

As strong as Du Shiyi was, he would only be able to match four to five peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings under normal conditions, and how many top-tier elites were there here?

“Ling Han, don’t be stubborn. Leave!”

As he said this, Du Shiyi did not stop moving at all. Furthermore, because the distance between them was getting farther and farther, the message he sent through divine sense had also become vague and indiscernible.

Ling Han shook his head. Du Shiyi actually did not believe in his battle prowess.

Right at this moment, the Azure Ghost Celestial King and his companions had also reached Ling Han. All of them had cold expressions, while their eyes were filled with killing intent. Not the slightest sliver of emotion was seen in their gaze.

They had experienced a great breakthrough in strength, but they had also become mere puppets, left only with the instincts of slaughter and bloodshed.

When Ling Han saw that Du Shiyi had disappeared from sight, he knew that there was no time for him to delay. He then drew the Divine Demon Sword. After so many years, the Divine Demon Sword had also recovered considerably, and was the size of his palm now.

“Die!” Ling Han charged out, the sword light transforming into a brilliant, majestic light.

The Azure Ghost Celestial King and the others all met his blow with a punch of their own, showing no fear.

‘Idiots!’

Even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate might not dare to directly take on a Heavenly Venerate Tool with his physical body. The damage caused would be too great; to take a strike from a Heavenly Venerate Tool head-on was an extremely and extraordinarily stupid move.

Yet the Azure Ghost Celestial King and company had all lost the ability to make judgment that a normal person would have. They could only battle instinctively, and faced with a flash of sword light… what was there to be afraid of? What would a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate have to fear?

Pu, pu, pu! The Divine Demon Sword swept out, and the Azure Ghost Celestial King and the others were all immediately slashed in half.

They were unable to withstand even a single strike!

Ling Han was also feeling slightly rueful. When he had first entered into the Celestial King Graveyard, any of these three people would have been able to easily destroy him with a single move, yet now he had killed the three great elites with a single strike. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You guys wait here for me,” Ling Han said to the large black dog and Wally.

“Okay.” The large black dog naturally wouldn’t stubbornly insist on going with Ling Han, and Wally was even less likely to do something unnecessary.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and golden light surged from his body, turning into supreme seals. These were seals that had surpassed Regulations, but had not reached the level of Heavenly Venerable Seals yet. Peng! Exerting force with his legs, he shot directly into the air.

In the skies, waves of heat intertwined together, and the destructive power was not much inferior as compared to the lava itself. Furthermore, because they were all intertwined together, there was no blind spot at all. Actually, this was an even more dangerous place than the ground.

But Ling Han ignored it. With the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll protecting his body, he presently had defense that was close to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Even Regulations of the highest level could no longer wound him.

He set out in swift pursuit.

Ordinarily, since Du Shiyi had started off earlier than Ling Han, there was practically no chance that the former could catch up to him. However, who asked Du Shiyi to go somewhere that the terrain was very unique, and one would not be able to run straight, and had to continue traveling on a crisscrossing path?

This gave Ling Han a chance of catching up.

Because he had already lost track of Du Shiyi, Ling Han feared that they would be going in opposite directions. Thus, as he traveled, he continued to observe the tracks that were left behind along the way. Only once he could confirm that there was no mistake did he set off at full speed.

About an hour later, Du Shiyi and those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that were pursuing him once again appeared in Ling Han’s vision.

WIth a tap of his foot, Ling Han stepped on the air. Peng! His whole person shot out, descending.

Tong!

He landed, and did not distinguish where he was at all. He directly dropped into the lava, and instantly created a splash of lava that was several hundred meters tall. Practically this whole area of lava had been splashed out from the impact.

This commotion was so great that Du Shiyi and the others couldn’t help but turn to look at him. When they discovered that this person was actually Ling Han, Du Shiyi was instantly dumbfounded.

How could it be Ling Han?

How could he possibly have such great speed?

Why had he run over?

Even if he was loyal, that was not the right way to show it!

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Brother Du, you ran too quickly, and made it very tiring for me to chase after you.”

Du Shiyi could only gape, and did not know what to say in response.

Yet those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that had pursued him would not just stand blankly there. It was true that they were only left with the instincts to battle, but this also meant that they could completely ignore anything surprising. Xiu, xiu, xiu! They all charged towards Du Shiyi.

Du Shiyi wanted to flee, but it was already too late. He could only take it head-on. He circled his hands, and he unleashed his full power with a loud shout.

Peng!

A heavy bang rang out, and Du Shiyi was instantly sent flying. Just when it looked like he was about to fall into the lava, a figure flashed. Ling Han had long darted out, catching the back of his robes just in time.

“Ling Han, leave me be. Run; it is more important to report the news!” Du Shiyi uttered, coughing up blood. Having survived after sustaining a blow that was practically the combined power of so many Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, he was indeed deserving of his reputation as one of the big shots of the martial academy, an overlord of Ninth Heaven.

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Brother Du, just rest on the side, and see how I will kill all enemies in my way!”

He placed Du Shiyi on a floating rock, and then turned to look towards those Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

These Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates showed no respect. To say nothing of the fact that Ling Han was only in the Ninth Heaven, even if they were facing a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, they would still continue their charge without the slightest hesitation.

Thus, they all moved.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.

Du Shiyi could no longer bring himself to watch. It was clear that death was inevitable for Ling Han, and with the serious injuries that Du Shiyi had now sustained, he, too, would not be able to escape. He felt great regret. He feared that he would have to disappoint A’mu and the others.

Shua! A sword light flashed past, dazzling the skies, and also causing everything else to fade with its brilliance.

Du Shiyi couldn’t help but narrow his eyes, and when he opened them again, he could see that seven out of the 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates had actually already fallen. Either their heads were severed, or they had been cut in half.

‘This…!’

Ling Han had killed seven Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with a single strike?

No matter how weak these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were, they were still Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. They were stronger than even the strongest Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

A light flashed through Du Shiyi’s mind, and he exclaimed, “You, you have broken through to the Ninth Heaven!”

Aside from this, there was no other possible explanation.

Since Ling Han had already started killing, he naturally would not continue to hold back at all. He continued his charge, and he soon killed the other three Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates as well. However, after the battle, his face was also extremely flushed, and he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

How could having 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates attacking him at the same time be just a game?
