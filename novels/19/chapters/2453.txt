Chapter 2454: Negotiations

Hui was secure, knowing that he had backing. He was brimming with confidence.

He was determined to get all of their blood. Why did he only choose Monarch Stars? Not only was it because they had powerful battle prowess and could withstand the sea of insects, it was also because only their blood would be effective for him, and could help him deceive the heaven and earth so he could leave this place.

Thus, he did not hesitate even if he would risk being severely injured by the Heaven and Earth Origin Stars. This was something that could be slowly healed from, but if he missed this opportunity, just when would he have another chance when there would be so many Monarch Stars gathered together?

“Then let’s battle!” Huo Furong declared coldly.

If they were to battle outside, their chances of victory would actually be even lower. The water vines would only have to damage their ship, and just allow the ocean to deal with them.

If they battled here, they would still have some hope. After all, this was inside Hui’s body; his battle prowess would definitely be affected.

Ling Han sighed, and took out the Dimension Scroll. “Hui Hui, you had better not force me?”

“Oh?” Hui looked towards Ling Han, a sliver of fury flickering in his eyes.

Ling Han actually dared call him Hui?Hui1?

“So what if I force you?” Hui asked, appearing very disdainful.

Ling Han broke into a grin. With a thought, he activated Wally’s model. Instantly, he began to extract the energy inside the Dimension Scroll.?Weng, his body glowed, and a frightening power surged out, presently erasing the poison in his body at a rapid rate.

One was the most fundamental Void Particle Energy of the Genesis World, while the other was the poison of parasites in the body of some Celestial Herb on the Celestial Path. Just how wide was the gap between their levels?

Countless times over!

......

Hence, when this energy surged out, the poison in his body rapidly melted like snow that was met with blazing fire.

Kuang

, a sudden clap of thunder rang out, but did not appear above the cave. Instead, it was at a more distant location.

Hui immediately paled in shock. Others might not be able to see it, but it was very clear to him. Dense clouds were spreading out above his body, with lightning flashing and blazing. A terrifying heavenly tribulation was presently building up.

Just what level had this tribulation attained?

He only had a feeling that if he was struck even once, he would definitely be done for.

But he hadn’t broken through to the next cultivation level, nor had he done anything that would anger the heaven and earth, so how could there possibly be a heavenly tribulation targeting him?

No, no, no, it was not targeting him; it was targeting Ling Han!

Just because Ling Han was inside his body, the moment he experienced the heavenly tribulation, the latter would think that Hui was covering for Ling Han, and what was the consequence of interfering in a heavenly tribulation? Being struck by lightning as well!

He was going to be forced to undergo the tribulation.

“Stop! Stop now!” Hui quickly called out loudly. If this heavenly tribulation really formed, then everyone here would die, and he would be no exception, either.

Ling Han naturally couldn’t possibly allow a Heavenly Venerate Tribulation to really form. He stopped extracting the energy inside the Dimension Scroll and smiled calmly. “Now, I think we have the need to negotiate, right?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Hui was speechless. After a while, he asked, “What do you want?”

Ling Han smiled calmly. “First, you have to ferry us across the great ocean.”

“And then?” Hui asked.

“Secondly, you have to let us go, of course.”

Hui immediately refused. “I can only let you go alone, at most.” He needed the blood of these Monarch Stars. Otherwise, he would have no way to change himself and leave the Celestial Path. In his eyes, this was a cage, imprisoning him forever in here.

Ling Han shook his head. “No, you can only detain these two people at most.” He pointed at Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong. They were the descendants of the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. He couldn’t be bothered to care about their lives.

Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong were both enraged. ‘F***, you are really too underhanded, aren’t you?’

But they did not flip out. Instead, they chose to follow Ling Han and the others all the way through. In this way, they would be able to escape together.

“No, at least five.” Hui shook his head. Five was the lowest limit. If there were less than five, there would be no way he could modify himself.

Ling Han shook his head. Aside from Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong, the others were not so evil that he could use them as sacrifices. He once again extracted the energy inside the Dimension Scroll, and caused the thunderclouds to roll out, increasing his persuasiveness.

Yet Hui had firmed his resolve. “I have already lived long enough, and have no wish to stay trapped in this damn place any longer. Thus, if I cannot leave this place, there is no difference whether I live or die!”

Really?

Ling Han could not confirm it. Logically, Hui had just dealt with the disaster in his body, and should be presently looking forward very much to a wonderful life ahead of him. However, in the process of a Herb Spirit ascending Dao, who knew if they had had their brains burnt out as well.

He continued to absorb the energy inside the Dimension Scroll, and in the instant right before the heavenly tribulation arrived, he stopped.

Hui did not speak, and was using this means to express his determination, his resolve in leaving this place.

He had to have predicted that Ling Han had no wish to die, either, and that was why he had the confidence to be so firm.

However, this had really hit Ling Han’s sore spot.

Ling Han thought for a while, and then said, “You only need blood essence; it is not a must that you want our lives. Hence, we can all surrender some blood essence to you so you can achieve your goal.”

Hui was silent, and nodded after a while. “All right.”

Ling Han looked towards the rest, and when he saw them nodding as well, he nodded, and said, “We have reached an agreement on the second condition. Now, the third, and final, condition.”

“Speak,” Hui said. His expression was very livid. In his mind, he should have been able to overwhelm all of them, yet now was forced into negotiations, which made him feel very gloomy.

It should be known he had played with them in the palm of his hand previously, so naturally he felt an indescribable feeling of superiority. Yet now, this sense of superiority had been shattered, and this was a very large gap.

Ling Han said, “I need celestial fruits as well.”

He did not say “we,” because this was what he had earned through his own strength. There was no need for him to share with others.

“How many?” Hui asked after a moment of silence. These celestial fruits were what he had nurtured himself originally, and were of no use to him at all. However, now that he had already ascended Dao, giving out celestial fruits would be equivalent to wounding his own vitality. Naturally, he was not very willing.

Ling Han thought for a while. “20.”

Hui almost broke out into curses. ‘These are celestial fruits; do you think they are cabbages? And you actually want 20? 20 your sister.’

“One!” he declared coldly.

“That’s too few!” Ling Han shook his head. “More.”

“Two,” Hui said after a pause.

“Some more.”

It was like Ling Han and Hui had become businessmen. One was calling out exorbitant prices, while the other was not willing to budge a single bit. After haggling for a long while, they finally settled on a deal—seven.

“One for her, one for him, one for her…” Ling Han pointed at Hu Niu, the Rain Emperor, and the others. He took one of the seven celestial fruits for himself, while the rest were given to Hu Niu, the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou, the Rain Emperor, Ji Wuming, and Huo Furong, respectively.

He had given one to Ji Wuming because Ling Han hoped that the former could be stronger and catch up with him, and in the case of Huo Furong, it actually was due to the same reason as well. However, Huo Furong was incredibly strong on her own, with an astonishingly high Evolution Index.

Both Dongfang Rui and Xuan Rong were very envious, but how could it be that they would ask for celestial fruits from Ling Han?

“All right, take us to the coast.”

Hui did not say a single word. He turned and left, his figure disappearing like foam. Though he could still leave the Celestial Path, according to the agreement, the process was bumpy and rocky. It had not been as smooth as he had imagined, which made him very displeased.

Seven months later, Hui appeared again, and said, “We’ve reached the coast.”

They left, and with Hui leading the way, the labyrinth was naturally no issue. Very quickly, they arrived at the cave entrance from before. After walking out, they could see the bright crimson sun hanging in the skies, which lightened their spirits as well.
