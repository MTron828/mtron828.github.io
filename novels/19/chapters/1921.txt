Chapter 1922: A true monarch tier

“Yan Xianlu, you are too arrogant!” Shan Jitong revealed an expression of anger.

Though Yan Xianlu indeed had a well-known reputation, and was known as the strongest in the Severing Mundane Tier, they were all monarch tiers here, so how could the gap possibly be so wide that two people would have to join forces to be able to match him?

He was arrogant to the point of ignorance.

Yan Xianlu stood with his hands crossed behind his back, calmly asking, “Whether it is arrogance or not, won’t you find out once you make your move?”

“Brother Yan, what boldness!” Lao Song said smilingly, his smile very alluring. Merely in terms of appearance, this face really made it seem like he was actually a woman in disguise. He raised a hand, his little finger slightly raised. “However, Brother Yan, you should never seek to be embarrassed!”

Shan Jitong, on the other hand, did not object now. His reputation no longer needed to be strengthened through victories in battles. Thus, even if he did join forces with Lao Song against Yan Xianlu, so what? Who would dare doubt his worth as a prodigy?

He was only teaching a person with overwhelmingly soaring confidence a lesson.

“Then, Yan Xianlu, come!” Shan Jitong was the first to move. Xiu, he turned into a streak of shadowy light, and appeared in front of Yan Xianlu with a flash. Then, he shot out a punch.

Though this was only a punch, it had raised the great aura of the heaven and earth. It was as if this fist the only remaining existence in the whole heaven and earth as it moved to suppress Yan Xianlu.

Lao Song moved as well. Pushing out an arm, he turned it into a silver snake. It clearly bore fangs, yet did not make anyone feel that it looked twisted and ugly. Instead, it exuded a sacred might.

The silver snake moved, yet took the lead even while starting slower, moving to wrap around Yan Xianlu.

Pa, the silver snake coiled around Yan Xianlu’s body, and suddenly constricted around him, wanting to forcibly squeeze him into pieces. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Brother Yan, you have underestimated your opponent too much!” Lao Song’s alluring gaze flickered with fury. That was because Yan Xianlu had not countered at all, and allowed the silver snake to constrict around his body, showing a strong contempt for his opponent.

Yan Xianlu only smiled faintly, and when Shan Jitong’s fist blasted over, he finally stretched out a hand calmly. He freed himself from the snake, and greeted the blow with a punch of his own.

Boom!

A shock wave rippled out, surging out in all directions. Then, it was followed by another, and yet another. At least about 100 shock waves spread out in all directions in the form of blazing light, presenting a majestic sight.

Both Shan Jitong and Lao Song were astounded.

Shan Jitong was stunned. A careless punch from Yan Xianlu had parried his own attack, and furthermore, he was at a slight disadvantage at that. He had been sent flying. While he did not suffer any injury, the inferiority of his battle prowess could not be any more obvious.

As for Lao Song? He was well aware of how frightening it was to have the silver snake wrapped around one’s body, but Yan Xianlu had easily struggled free just now, as if that was not an image of the Source Snake, but merely a piece of rope that had not been tied too tightly.

However, their expressions became considerably more livid.

That was because Yan Xianlu was facing both of them at the same time. In a battle of two against one, he was still relaxed and carefree. In fact, he had the upper hand, even. How could they be able to accept that?

They were.... monarch tiers!

Monarch tiers overlooked the Nine Heavens, looking down on the mortal world, high and noble, so how could they lose?

“The two of you should go out and take a look,” Yan Xianlu stated calmly. “With how big the world is, there are as many prodigies as clouds. The two of you are overly subjective, and disregard the outside world. Do you think that you are invincible among your peers now that you have become monarch tiers?

“There are also differences in strength among monarch tiers!”

When he said the last words, his radiance shone brilliantly. That drive and that divine might could not be concealed.

He, Yan Xianlu, King of the Celestial Path, was the true monarch!

Both Shan Jitong and Lao Song were captivated. Though they had only exchanged blows once, though they still had world-shaking ultimate moves that they had yet to use, when one had reached the heights that they had, it was apparent who was stronger the moment they clashed.

Yan Xianlu was indeed the strongest in the younger generation of the Eastern Celestial Realm.

To say nothing of strength, just this domineering demeanor was nothing that they could compare with, making them actually feel an urge of wanting to serve him, and follow him as he conquered the world.

They were shocked. As high and noble monarch tiers, how could they possibly want to follow another? But this kind of urge could not be suppressed no matter how hard they tried.

“Ling Han! Ling Han!”

Right at this moment, a voice rang out from below them. Though it was very rushed, there was an indescribably pleasant ring to it.

Yan Xianlu was surprised. He naturally knew who Ling Han was, but who was this woman?

There was great dao as a barrier here, and he could not use his vision to its fullest. He could only see a vague figure. However, this figure immediately became clearer. Suddenly, an astonishingly beautiful young girl fell into his range of sight.

She was truly beautiful, and also pure and delicate.

How could there be such a beautiful, such a pure woman?

Even with Yan Xianlu’s Dao Heart, he still trembled slightly. Then, he immediately regained his wits. Before reaching Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, he would not consider any matters outside of cultivation.

Yi, this woman... He had definitely not invited her!

Though there were many that had come this time, all of them had been carefully selected by Yan Xianlu. There was definitely none that could masquerade and mix in with those he had invited. With his memory, he naturally remembered clearly whom he had invited and what they looked like.

Moreover, he had not seen this young girl at the foot of the mountain, either.

...What superb speed!

He was immediately stunned. The young girl had definitely set off later than them, yet actually arrived just a little bit later than them. This strength was truly impressive.

Strange, how could he possibly be unaware that such a prodigy had emerged?

Both Shan Jitong and Lao Song also bore the same thoughts. To be capable of arriving just a bit later than them, this strength was truly astonishing. And while the Eastern Celestial Realm was shockingly colossal, and it was impossible for them to travel all over the Eastern Celestial Realm, knowing each and every prodigy, there should only be those few that really had truly outstanding talent.

‘F*ck!’

Yan Xianlu and the others had not finished their thoughts when an expression of powerful shock appeared on their faces. That was because the young girl had not come alone, but had rather brought an “army” with her.

An army made up of the memory manifestations of a Celestial King.

An army, what kind of concept was this?

Only when the number had reached a certain extent could it be called an army, and behind the young girl, the number of manifestations was at least in the hundreds. They were surging forward like wild horses, wave after wave surging over. From a few hundred it became a few thousand, and then over 10,000!

Heavens!

Even a supreme prodigy like Yan Xianlu almost exclaimed in shock. Just who was this young girl to have actually incited the appearance of so many manifestations?

More importantly, she actually still managed to be in the lead, and was not harmed by them at all.

Otherwise, she would have long since been intercepted, and submerged by these manifestations.

The art of fleeing was truly impressive, and furthermore, she was an overwhelmingly bold person too—she actually dared draw out so many manifestations? Wasn’t she afraid that she would suffer a setback?

Peng! Peng!

Wisps of clouds drifted ahead, turning into a human figure, which then shot out towards the young girl. However, it had just rushed forwards when the young girl shot out a punch followed by a kick, and it was sent flying.

This, very strong.

Yan Xianlu and the others bore grim expressions. To be able to bring such a large troop of manifestations and barge through would only mean that this young girl’s speed was high enough, but that punch previously only showed strength.

A simple punch, plain and unadorned, yet it was a return to the basics, concentrating and instilling great dao in her fist.

It was as if she was saying, “I myself am Dao, so who could stand in my way?”

“Out of the way! Out of the way!” The young girl rushed over on a straight course, her expression filled with impatience. “Whoever doesn’t get out of the way, Niu will send him flying with a punch!”
