Chapter 1429 Wood Figure Plane

It was a pity that they had to set off straight away, meaning that Ling Han didn’t have the opportunity to have the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden attend to him tonight.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle began another lengthy journey, only arriving at the Myriad Directions Galaxy after one entire year. It then flew toward Wood Figure Planet.

The Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was located on none other than Wood Figure Planet.

This was an open planet that didn’t have any planet-protection formation. This made it appear extremely generous and open. However, this was also a very dangerous decision. If a starship suddenly launched a sneak attack, the planet wouldn’t have any way of defending against it.

However, no one was worried about this problem.

What a joke! The Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was located on this planet, and inside this academy were 10 Genesis Tier Saints! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

10 Saints! What kind of concept was this?

Generally speaking, it would be a great miracle if a galaxy could produce a Saint. For example, the Long Light Galaxy didn’t even have a single Saint, with Eternal River Tier elites being the rulers of that galaxy. From this, it could be seen just how rare Genesis Tier Saints were. Here, however, there were a whopping 10 Saints on a single planet! Wasn’t this simply incredible?

Who dared to attack this planet? Who would be retarded enough to attack this planet?

With Saints guarding the planet, what need was there for a planet-protecting formation? That would be a waste of True Origin Stones!

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle started to descend. However, its descent was extremely hard to control, and Ling Han didn’t have a target landing destination, either. Thus, he didn’t pay much attention and directly landed wherever.

Everyone left the Black Tower, only to see that this was an expanse of marshlands. Gray mist suffused the surroundings, significantly limiting how far they could see.

“Such rich Spiritual Qi!”

“The richer the Spiritual Qi, the more and faster True Origin Stones are formed. At the same time, the overall level of cultivation will also be higher,” the Notionless Saint said. After reaching the Heavenly Body Tier, even his speed of cultivation had slowed down. He could no longer advance rapidly simply through cultivation.

Thus, he also exited the Black Tower. Moreover, this could also prevent him from being tossed out of the Black Tower and used as Ling Han’s shield.

“As expected of a place that can produce Saints!” everyone exclaimed.

They had been to Cloud Apex Planet before, and they had already thought that the Spiritual Qi there was very rich. However, only after arriving here did they realize that there were always places more impressive than the previous. Moreover, this was only a mere marshland, and not a holy land for cultivation. If they traveled to those famous mountains and valleys, they would definitely find mines of True Origin Stones and unbelievably rich Spiritual Qi.

They continued forward. Although those below the Heavenly Body Tier couldn’t fly, who didn’t know how to tread over water? They all traversed across the marshland, not causing a single splash in the water below.

Boom!

A gigantic figure suddenly burst from the water, biting at Ling Han and the others. This was a gigantic crimson alligator. However, it had a single bull horn as well as four wolf-like legs, making it appear incredibly strange.

Little Qing chirped before immediately swooping down and grabbing the gigantic alligator with its claws. It transformed into its original shape, its wingspan reaching 3000 meters at full stretch. It was even larger than the gigantic alligator.

The alligator was only at the Shattering Void Tier, so how could it withstand the power of Little Qing? Its bones were immediately crushed, and it was as dead as could be.

“Even some random alligator dares to ambush us. It’s truly seeking death!”

“But the environment here is far too suitable for cultivation. The first Demonic Beast that we came across was already at the Shattering Void Tier. This is a clear sign of how dangerous this place is.”

“Mm-hm. Although we’re all very powerful, it’s best that we remain alert and careful.”

Xiu!

Right at this moment, a streak of light suddenly flashed before them, shooting at the soaring Little Qing. Little Qing’s wingspan measured over 3000 meters in length right now, so it was naturally far too big a target.

Ling Han saw the streak of light clearly. That was an arrow!

He immediately snapped his fingers, activating the Lightning Sword Technique. His attack reached the arrow even though he had unleashed it later.

Pa!

The arrow instantly shattered into pieces.

In terms of attack speed, it was very likely that no one at the same cultivation level—no, same major tier—could compare to Ling Han. In terms of might, the Lightning Sword Technique was also incredibly powerful, especially since it had been imbued with heaven’s might.

Fury involuntarily spread across Ling Han’s face. They hadn’t provoked anyone, yet someone had suddenly fired an arrow at them. What was the meaning of this?

However, before they could even seek out the assailant to question them, they saw a man fly over, anger on his face. Behind him were two elders. These elders were clearly his servants.

“Who’s sabotaging my hunting?” the man asked, haughtiness on his face.

‘Hunting? He’s treating Little Qing as an ordinary Demonic Beast?’

Ling Han humphed in displeasure. He was a protective person, and he had just seen Little Qing being randomly targeted by a stranger, so how could he not be furious?

“This is my beast pet, yet it was almost wounded by you. How are you going to compensate me?” he asked balefully.

“Compensate you?” The man involuntarily chuckled upon hearing this. At this moment, his two servants finally caught up to him. However, they didn’t so much as glance at Ling Han and the others, merely standing behind the man respectfully.

“What a hilarious joke! Someone actually dares to ask me, Liu Shiyuan, to compensate them?”

“You’re not going to compensate me? That’s fine by me,” Ling Han said with a nod. Just when Liu Shiyuan thought that he was bowing his head, Ling Han continued, “I’ll also fire an arrow at you. That way, we’ll be even.”

Liu Shiyuan faltered for a moment before fury completely overtook him.

“Are you seeking death?” Ever since his brother had become a king tier, who had ever dared to speak to him like this?

“Apologize or eat my arrow!” Ling Han said calmly. There was firm determination in his voice.

“Impudence!” The two elders leaped forward, saying, “How dare you speak to Young Master like that. Immediately kneel down and accept your death!”

Liu Shiyuan crossed his arms before his chest with a sneer, asking, “Do you know who I am?”

Pu!

Almost everyone beside Ling Han laughed out loud upon hearing this. This was the standard question asked by every descendent of someone rich or powerful.

“Y-you people!” Liu Shiyuan became even more enraged. What kind of attitude was this?

“How audacious!” The two elders immediately charged over, unleashing their might without any restraint.

Ding Ping immediately stepped forward. Not willing to be beaten, Jiuyao also followed immediately after him.

Peng, peng!

The two of them each threw a punch, and the two elders were instantly sent flying backward, blood spraying from their nose and mouth.

Pa, pa!

The elders collapsed to the ground, groaning in pain and unable to pick themselves back up.

‘This...!’

Liu Shiyuan was instantly drained of his courage. Although these two elders were his servants, they were, in fact, even more powerful than him. In any case, he was merely borrowing the power of his clan, especially his older brother, to act wantonly. Moreover, it was only because of his clan and his older brother that he had the right to command these two servants who were at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Yet, they were actually defeated by those two young men in a single exchange.

“D-don’t act rashly!” Liu Shiyuan stammered as he saw Ding Ping and Jiuyao walking over. He hurriedly scuttered back in retreat, cold sweat dripping down his forehead. He hadn’t imagined that he would cause such huge trouble simply by coming here to hunt and pass time.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered speaking any more nonsense, either, directly activating the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Xiu!

There was a flash of golden light, and the arrow had already arrived before Liu Shiyuan’s left shoulder.

Pa!

His entire left arm exploded into oblivion. Blood splattered into the surroundings. This was truly a bloody sight.

Of course, this was already the result of Ling Han showing mercy. Otherwise, how could a measly cultivator at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier survive his attack?

“You... You...” Liu Shiyuan was experiencing such agony that streaks of tear and snot were flowing down his face. “My older brother is Liu Juntian! Since you’ve dared to treat me like this, my older brother definitely won’t forgive you!”

“Scram!” Ling Han waved his hand, uninterested to learn more about Liu Juntian. If this person appeared before him, he would happily engage him in battle.
