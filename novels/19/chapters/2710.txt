2711 Killed with a single strike

Originally, Ling Han would have been able to quickly recover even if all his limbs were broken, but since Ma Feng was saying this, he was clearly certain he could do this.

…As long as a sliver of martial intent was left behind and did not disperse, even the slightest of injuries could not possibly recover.

In the martial academy, even Ma Feng did not dare to do as he liked and just kill anyone. After all, he, too, was only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han frowned. “Brother Ma, I have always kept to my own principles. Without others coming to trifle with me, I would not go to cause trouble for others, either. Thus, do not just listen to the one-sided story of your son!”

Ma Feng sneered. “Just for your disrespectful attitude towards me, I will teach you a lesson as well!”

Too arrogant; a mere Celestial King actually dared to treat a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate like they were equals.

At this time, there were a considerable number of people rushing their way here from various mountains.

They had long since been anticipating this moment. Since Ling Han did not go to see Ma Yuhai, there would definitely be some action from Ma Feng. Hence, once Ma Feng appeared, everyone quickly made their way here.

Ma Yuhai had also come, a smirk at the corners of his lips. Ling Han actually dared to insult him repeatedly. Today, he would make Ling Han have a taste of how it felt to be humiliated.

However, now that things had come so far, he naturally had no delusions that he could change the mind of the young miss from the Wang Clan.

Ling Han looked at Ma Feng.

It could be claimed that he had met a considerable number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, and had also killed no small number of them. However, compared with Ma Feng, aside from Lin Piaoxue, there was no one that had any hope of catching up to him.

After all, He Yufeng and Yun Haoyang had only just broken through, while the Azure Ghost Celestial King and the others had been string puppets that were formed through a forceful power boost. Which of them could compare to Ma Feng?

This was a true Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

“Brother Ma, I respect you for how you’ve battled so many years in the Realm Battlefield. This is my last word of advice; this matter ends here!” Ling Han stated calmly.

Even if Ma Feng’s strength far surpassed that of He Yufeng and Yun Haoyang, so what?

Ling Han’s present battle prowess, added with the Divine Demon Sword, was already enough to allow him to have no fear of any Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. How could he possibly tolerate such great humiliation?

Ma Feng showed a hint of disdain. A Celestial King dared to act arrogant in front of him and spout a threat. Just how far did he overestimate himself? He stated evenly, “My merits and sacrifices are not what you can understand at all!

“Kneel!” he suddenly exclaimed loudly, his voice rumbling violently, and penetrating straight to the soul.

Pa, pa, pa! Ling Han did not kneel, but there were at least a dozen people in the surroundings that fell to their knees.

None of these people did not feel apprehensive. It should be known that for better or worse, they were still monarch tiers, yet they could not resist even the mere exclamation from a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. And those who did not kneel had pale faces. The power of Heavenly Venerable Tier had surpassed Regulations, and was extremely terrifying.

Only Ling Han looked like he was completely unaffected. He crossed his arms behind his back, and asked smilingly, “Brother Ma, do you basically just depend on shouting for your battles?”

This was sarcasm.

Immediately, Ma Feng looked furious, and killing intent was also flashing in his gaze.

However, he had not even spoken yet, and Ma Yuhai had already jumped out. “Ling Han, you dare to be rude to my father? You should know this; my father has been battling with Hysteria in the Realm Battlefield. Without the sacrifice and blood of my father, what right would you have to stand here and speak?”

When they heard these words, quite a number of people were nodding inwardly. At present, it was only that the Heavenly Venerates did not appear, not that there were no Heavenly Venerates. It was just that they were all fighting Hysteria in the Realm Battlefield. This was a very great sacrifice worthy of respect.

“You dare disrespect the heroes of the Realm Battlefield; you deserve to die 10,000 times over!” Ma Yuhai continued.

Ling Han smirked. “That’s right. Disrespect towards someone who has done a great merit should kill you 10,000 times over!”

Xiu! He moved, and grabbed out at Ma Yuhai.

“How dare you!! In front of me, you still dare to act insolent?” Ma Feng also moved, delivering a palm strike at Ling Han. This brat had to have devoured the courage of an overlord; he actually dared to touch his son right in front of him. Was he an idiot?

Ling Han clenched a fist, and exchanged a blow with Ma Feng.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and Ling Han was instantly sent flying. However, Ma Feng’s feet also moved, taking seven steps backwards. Still, Ling Han also used the momentum from being sent flying to speed up and bounce towards Ma Yuhai.

Ling Han stretched out a hand and pressed down. How could Ma Yuhai be able to resist? Immediately, he fell into Ling Han’s grasp.

The moment he moved, Ling Han’s strength was no longer reserved, and nine ribbons of iridescent light flashed around him.

“A Ninth Heaven Celestial King!”

“Heavens, when he was fighting with He Yufeng, he was still in the Eighth Heaven!”

“Just how many years has passed? He has already advanced to the Ninth Heaven?”

All the disciples were dumbfounded and gaping. All of them were extraordinarily talented in cultivation, but faced with Ling Han’s rate of cultivation, aside from astonishment, they could only feel more astonishment.

Ma Feng’s expression was even uglier. A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had already interfered, yet was still unable to stop Ling Han from “committing a crime,” and his son had fallen into the latter’s hands.

He was both furious and anxious. He wanted nothing more than to blast Ling Han into bits, but was still wary as his son was still in Ling Han’s hold, and dared not make any rash moves.

“Let him go!” he demanded menacingly.

Ling Han shook his head. “Ma Feng, though I very much wish to respect you, I can only see your selfishness and arrogance! Just how much contribution do you think you have made? You are but a mere Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; in the Realm Battlefield, you are only a minor character.

“You say that Hysteria could cause even greater damage without you?

“Don’t think too highly of yourself.

“Why don’t you take a look at your son, and see what he has done!”

Ling Han paused, and then continued, “Previously, your son paid the price of a Heavenly Venerate Pill to hire a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to kill me. I would like to count it out for you then. What punishment would this attempt to kill a disciple of the martial academy be?”

“Absolute nonsense!” Ma Feng flicked his sleeves. He naturally would deny this completely. Otherwise, if the martial academy pursued the matter, this crime would be very great.

Ling Han picked up Ma Yuhai. “Will you admit to your crime?”

“You are speaking nonsense!” Ma Yuhai hurriedly shook his head. How could it be possible that he would admit to this? Furthermore, inside the martial academy, in front of his father, would Ling Han dare to use force to exert a confession from him?

“Not admitting?” Ling Han smiled, but his smile was filled with killing intent.

A chill rose in Ma Yuhai’s heart, but he immediately raised his head high again. “Since you are so determined to pin me with a crime, how am I supposed to admit to it? To treat a disciple of the martial academy like this, what do you regard the rules of the martial academy as? Do you really think that you are not bound by any rules and can do whatever you like?”

He smirked coldly. With this heavy sentence laid down on him, and with his father’s adding fuel to the fire, it was guaranteed that Ling Han would not be able to escape, and would have to pay a very heavy price for his deeds.

‘Force me; with so many people watching, the more force you are using, the worse your punishment from the martial academy will be in future.’

Meanwhile, Ma Feng smiled. He felt very gratified at how courageous his son was. He was still firm and unyielding despite falling into enemy hands. As expected of his good son.

The others were also watching Ling Han. Just how was he going to settle this?

“Ling Han, whatever you can think of, just do it. If I even wrinkle my brow, you can call me grandson!” Ma Yuhai became even more arrogant.

“I shall oblige then!” Ling Han smiled faintly. He struck down with his right hand, and pa, part of Ma Yuhai’s head immediately inverted to become mush.

Ma Yuhai looked blankly at Ling Han. He had never imagined that Ling Han would actually deliver a fatal strike against him.

How did he dare?

This was the martial academy, and his father was even standing guard on the sidelines. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He had not even finished the thought when he collapsed dispiritedly onto the ground. His mind had been pierced, so his only fate was naturally death.

Everyone was dumbfounded. They, like Ma Yuhai, were also stunned by how Ling Han dared to strike.

The only difference was that they could continue to feel shocked, but Ma Yuhai was already dead.
