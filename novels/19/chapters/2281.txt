Chapter 2282: Ba

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

In the past, limited by his strength, Ling Han had not done many experiments on the first scroll, and he had gradually forgotten about it afterwards. Now that he had set eyes on it once more, his curiosity could no longer be restrained.

He stabbed it with the Divine Demon Sword. When the tip of the blade touched the scroll, weng, an astonishing light surged out, and his hand became numb. The Divine Demon Sword almost flew out of his hand.

“This…

He was stunned. This scroll was really quite incredible. It could even match the sharpness of a Celestial Tool?

He scratched his head in exasperation. Just how exactly was he supposed to unfurl this scroll? He was really too curious.

Ling Han thought for a very long time, but he still stowed the two scrolls into his robes in the end. If he didn’t touch this thing, it would be no different from any ordinary paper. He could not sense anything special about it at all.

“Til think about it in the future. First, I have to modify the Heaven Deceiving Technique.”

He entered the Black Tower, and comprehended Dao underneath the Reincarnation Tree. The women had long since started to do this, and the price for it was a great expense in Star Stones. However, they had many Star Stones anyways, so there was no need for them to worry about the danger of

spending all their Star Stones for the moment.

After spending a million years underneath the Reincarnation Tree, Ling Han had finally successfully completed the modification of the Heaven Deceiving Technique. Of course, he had borrowed the help of the Origin Magic Cube. Otherwise, he could not reach that height in terms of Regulations.

He taught the modified Heaven Deceiving Technique to the women. After they had successfully learned it, to say nothing of deceiving Celestial Kings, deceiving Ascending Origin Tiers at least should be no issue.

The women continued their cultivation, while Ling Han returned to town.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe had already waited many days for him, but she was not here at present. Instead, Long Tu was waiting here for him.

“Greetings, milord!” When he spotted Ling Han, Long Tu immediately paid his respects. He knew that Ling Han was a monarch tier. There was a need to be respectful towards such an existence.

Seeing a member of the Foreign Realm greet him, his expression respectful, Ling Han felt an indescribable strangeness, yet showed nothing on his expression. He nodded slightly, and asked, “Has your master broken through to the Fifth Leaf?”

“Yes!” Long Tu immediately stood upright again. This was the Fifth Leaf. From now, she had advanced into the ranks of monarch tiers, and it was destined that she would eventually become an Ancestral King. Following this kind of master was naturally an honor as well.

Ling Han smiled. She was just a monarch star. He had killed who knew how many of them, and even a considerable number of Monarch Stars had died by his hand.

He asked, “Where is your master?”

“Our celestial maiden has waited many days. Please follow me, milord,” Long Tu said respectfully.

Ina small wood outside the town, a lavish carriage was standing by beside the road, and there were over a dozen people chatting and sipping tea around the carriage. Like the moon being surrounded by the stars, Celestial Maiden Yunhe accepted the flattery of those around her while she responded with a

cordial smile, appearing very calm and relaxed.

These people were all members of the Angel Race, all of them being handsome men and beautiful women. They presented a feast for the eyes.

“Celestial maiden, that person is really putting on airs too much, actually forcing you to wait for so many days!” someone exclaimed in displeasure.

“That’s right. Just who does he think our Celestial Maiden Yunhe is!”

“He really should not have done so!”

“Even if Celestial Maiden has a kind heart, and is not willing to speak up, we are still determined to seek justice for you.”

Everyone chattered spiritedly, trying their best to degrade Ling Han.

‘They were naturally jealous because they knew that if it were them that had been late for so many days, there would be absolutely no way that Celestial Maiden Yunhe would be waiting for them.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe only smiled faintly, a hint of pride on her face.

By now, she had advanced to the Fifth Severance, and this was precisely a moment when her spirits were the highest. She thought that the distance between herself and Ling Han had already shrunk endlessly, and she might in fact have surpassed him by now.

‘True, Di Fei had indeed died by Ling Han’s hand, but there were still differences in strength among Fifth Severance monarch tiers. At present, she felt that she was extremely strong, and completely had the strength that Ling Han possessed.

To advance from the Fourth Severance to Fifth Severance was equivalent to breaching the gap between the Fourth Severance and Dividing Soul Tier. This distance was naturally astonishing, and it was no wonder that she had such a high opinion of herself now.

At present, she really wanted to have a spar with Ling Han.

Right at this moment, Long Tu was seen leading someone here.

“What, a Demon Race?” When everyone saw this, they all showed expressions of dislike and disdain.

What member of the Angel Race did not hate the Demon Race? The power of darkness and light that both cultivated were natural enemies, and just barely maintaining peaceful relations was only possible under the pressure of the Heavenly Venerates.

‘They had never imagined that the person that Celestial Maiden Yunhe had been patiently waiting for was actually a member of the Demon Race.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe nodded. “He is indeed a member of the Demon Race.” Just when she was about to introduce Ling Han, she suddenly realized that her knowledge of Ling Han was practically zero. In fact, she didn’t even know his name.

“| forgot to ask your name?” she asked Ling Han.

Ling Han thought, and then said, “My name is… Ba‘!”

When everyone heard this, they were all gritting their teeth. This guy was really shameless. To actually call himself Ba!

‘There were some names that one could not give himself on a whim. For example, you could not simply call yourself Sword King, Sword Emperor, or something like that. Otherwise, there would definitely be swordsmen coming to challenge you.

‘The name Ba was an even greater mockery of the masses. Anyone who heard it would be displeased.

“Ba, right? Do you dare accept a spar?” Someone issued a challenge towards Ling Han.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Sure. However, everyone that has fought with me would mysteriously end up calling me father.”

Everyone was at a loss at first before realization dawned on them. If they ended up shivering from being beaten down on, and kept calling “Ba, Ba,” wouldn’t it be calling him father?

Why did this guy have such a mean tongue? From the very beginning, he was offending others.

“Zigian, stop.” Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly tried to stop him. This challenger was only a Fourth Severance king tier. When against Ling Han, he was practically delivering himself up to be defeated. Furthermore, Ling Han dared to kill even Di Fei, so was there anyone else he did not dare kill?

‘That challenger was naturally not convinced. In front of his goddess, how could he possibly cower? He humphed, and said, “Celestial maiden, don’t worry. I will observe propriety in my attacks.”

Xiu, he quickly charged out in attack without waiting for any further words from Celestial Maiden Yunhe.

Everyone felt their vision blur, and the next thing they saw was that Ling Han had gripped the challenger by his neck.

Ling Han slightly released the killing intent in his body, and the challenger instantly shuddered harshly, saying shakily, “Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba…”

In everyone’s ears, it did indeed sound like he was calling Ling Han father’.

This guy was really too mean, to actually give himself such a name.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe stepped out, and said, “Brother Ba, I shall battle with you.”

Ling Han’s enthusiasm waned. He had defeated even a Seventh Lotus Three Leaves king tier, so how could he possibly be interested to spar with a Sixth Lotus monarch tier. He merely yawned, tossed the challenger casually to the side, and said, “All right, I’ll exchange a few moves with you.”

Everyone was extremely angered. Ling Han was clearly a Severing Mundane Tier as well, yet actually dared to speak so proudly. He was really too arrogant.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe set her eyes on Ling Han, and prepared to make a move, but while her eyes were fixed on Ling Han, a profound chill came to be in her heart, and she actually dared not attack. She instinctively felt that she would be harshly struck by Ling Han if she dared to move in the slightest,

and would die an early, pitiable death.

This was an intuition that she had gained only after advancing into the Fifth Severance, and she trusted this kind of feeling very much. According to her elders, this was an early warning about danger, and she could not take it lightly.

To drum up courage for herself, she drew out a sword. It was entirely jade blue in color, and looked like crystal. At the same time, there were multiple ancient seals carved on its blade.

“This is the Jade Moon Lake Life Sword!”

“The precious tool that has been passed through the generations of Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s clan!”

“No, no, no, this must be a subsidiary sword. Otherwise, how could Celestial Maiden Yunhe be allowed to take it out?”

“Even if it is a subsidiary sword, it should still be extremely powerful.”

“Yi, why is Celestial Maiden Yunhe still not making a move?”

Everyone was stunned. It was as if Celestial Maiden Yunhe was dazed. She merely stood in position, but still made no move.
