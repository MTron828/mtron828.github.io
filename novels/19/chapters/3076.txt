3077 Seventh Tier!

“Ling Han!” Lin Luo and the others exclaimed. They were all filled with delight.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly erupted from Ling Han’s body, and it was as if torrential waves were crashing into the surroundings.

“This brat… didn’t die! Not only that, but he even advanced to the Seventh Tier!” Extermination muttered in disbelief. Her raven hair danced wildly in the wind, reflecting the disorderly emotions in her mind.

‘How is this possible?!’

He had suffered severe self-inflicted wounds and shattered his own defenses, after which he had been furiously attacked by two of the most powerful Seventh Tier ultimate elites in the world. Moreover, he didn’t possess the indestructible body of a Seventh Tier elite, so he should have been killed as comprehensively as could be.

“I’ve yet to obliterate you people, so how can I die so easily?” Ling Han said as he suddenly stood up straight. He was still drenched in blood, and he was still riddled with wounds. At this moment, however, he was filled with soaring spirit and energy.

“How is this possible?!” Extermination spat through gritted teeth. She couldn’t accept this reality.

Being attacked by her and Hysteria was no joke. This wasn’t something that one could overcome through grit and determination alone.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Don’t you two know? The more pressure I’m under, the more motivation I feel.”

It was in that moment of life or death that he had borrowed the power of the core fragment to initiate communication with the sixth type of fundamental power.

Even though he had only extracted a wisp of this fundamental power, it had been enough to elevate his physique to a state of indestructibility. Add to that the overwhelming Powers of Dimension inside him, and he was naturally able to withstand the frenzied attacks of the two supremely powerful beings.

His strength was almost identical to before, yet his physique had finally reached a state of indestructibility. This signified that he had no more weaknesses.

He was flawless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Come, let me show you true strength!” Ling Han said with loud laughter. He actively charged at Hysteria and Extermination, swinging his fists and unleashing a barrage of wild attacks.

Peng!

It was only one strike, yet Extermination was already sent flying. Another strike, and Hysteria’s colossal body was sent flying as well. It was as if Hysteria were a giant toy being tossed through the air.

After advancing to the Seventh Tier, Ling Han’s power was now unrivaled, and his physique was now indestructible. This was a most perfect form.

Hysteria and Extermination bellowed in fury as they charged back over. However, against this peerless man, they could do nothing but grit their teeth and endure punishment.

In reality, this was quite similar to before. Ling Han attacked, while the two of them defended.

In the past, however, Ling Han would suffer self-inflicted wounds while he attacked them. Moreover, these wounds would increase in severity until he eventually shattered his own defenses.

But now?

Ling Han had already resolved this problem. His body was now invincible, and he no longer needed to worry about wounding himself from the huge burden.

‘What can we do?’

It was now Hysteria and Extermination’s turn to feel worried.

Now that Ling Han had advanced to the Seventh Tier, it signified that there was still more room for his battle prowess to grow. All he needed was some time.

In other words, Hysteria and Extermination would remain at the same level, while Ling Han would gradually grow stronger and stronger as he fought. If this continued, there would eventually come a day when they were defeated, suppressed, or even killed.

Hysteria became truly wild at this moment, swinging its tentacles in a crazy manner and acting as if it wanted to suppress Ling Han. However, what use would this be?

“You block him first!” Extermination suddenly said to Hysteria using her divine sense.

With a flash, she rapidly retreated from the battlefield.

Ling Han frowned slightly. However, only Hysteria was capable of swallowing the Celestial Realm, so it was this monster that he needed to pay the most attention to. He didn’t need to pay much attention to the others.

Once he disposed of Hysteria, the catastrophic threat lingering over the Genesis World would also be swept away. At that time, Extermination wouldn’t be able to do anything regardless of how powerful she was.

One had to realize that the Genesis World was also filled with life and vitality. Even though there was only a single dimension remaining, this dimension could still slowly manifest new dimensions, eventually leading to a flourishing situation just like before.

He continued to pummel Hysteria.

Just his raw power alone was already enough to rival Hysteria, or perhaps even suppress it. Now that his power had increased 100,000-fold, just how devastating was the situation?

Hysteria was instantly forced to scramble back in retreat. Without Extermination helping it, it was completely unable to block Ling Han’s attacks.

Ling Han gave chase, and was just about to suppress Hysteria. However, he suddenly felt a dull pain in his chest, and his attack immediately skewed to the side and missed its target.

‘What’s going on?’

Wasn’t he an invincible Seventh Tier elite? So why was he still feeling pain in his chest?

Ling Han didn’t give this much thought, and he threw another punch at Hysteria.

However, he felt another burst of pain in his chest, a pain so uncomfortable that he could barely control himself.

This was definitely no coincidence.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the surroundings. This was definitely related to Extermination. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have left the battlefield for no reason.

“Looking for me?” Extermination asked. Using her formidable power, she could rapidly send her words to anywhere in the void.

She walked over, holding someone in her hand.

Wang Quanhe!

He had already been suppressed by Ling Han just then. Regardless, he wouldn’t have been able to rival Extermination even if he were at his peak state.

Ling Han’s pupils contracted. Perhaps the pain in his chest was related to Wang Quanhe?

“Extermination, what are you doing?” Wang Quanhe howled in fury.

“If I hadn’t wanted to use you as a backup plan, would I have raised you with all my effort and even destroyed a dimension to help you advance to the Seventh Tier?” Extermination sneered. “It’s time for you to show your worth now.”

What?! It was because Extermination had destroyed one of her dimensions that Wang Quanhe was able to advance to the Seventh Tier?

Since these were dimensions, they naturally had dimension cores as well. Moreover, Extermination possessed transcendent dimensions inside her, so bestowing Wang Quanhe with a dimension core from one of these dimensions was indeed enough to raise him to the Seventh Tier.

One had to realize that a transcendent dimension was equivalent to at least 10 Seventh Tier elites. Thus, paying such a huge price to raise a single Seventh Tier elite could be regarded as extremely extravagant.

Extermination was no charitable person, either, so why had she decided to help Wang Quanhe?

“This is called the Blood Murder Technique,” Extermination explained calmly. “As long as two people share the same bloodline, this technique will allow me to wound one person and therefore wound the other person at the same time.

“However, if the target is too powerful, the person being wounded by the technique also needs to be powerful enough.

“So that’s why I helped him advance to the Seventh Tier.”

Extermination smiled, and continued, “I initially thought that this was an unnecessary plan, one that needlessly caused me to lose a significant amount of my battle prowess. Now, however, it looks like I was very correct to take such extreme measures.

“Ling Han, you truly can’t be underestimated.”

As she said this, she stabbed her fingers into Wang Quanhe’s chest.

This was extremely uncanny, and Ling Han immediately felt a piercing pain in his chest as well. It was as if his heart were about to explode.

‘Gasp! This Blood Murder Technique is truly powerful!’

“Extermination, you’ll definitely suffer a wretched death!” Wang Quanhe roared.

“Shut up!” Extermination ordered coldly. “You should already count yourself lucky that a piece of trash like you was able to witness the secrets of the Seventh Tier. Did you really think I took a fancy to a useless fool like you?”

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. No wonder Wang Quanhe had betrayed him so resolutely. As it turned out, part of the reason had been the feeling of “affection” between him and Extermination.

Extermination was indeed a breathtaking beauty, and Wang Quanhe was also someone who had suffered a tragedy when it came to love. Thus, it wasn’t strange that he had fallen for Extermination’s purposeful seduction.

Even though Ling Han found this plan a little shameless, he couldn’t help but admire Extermination for her resoluteness and far-sightedness. She had sacrificed so much power and effort simply to raise a pawn that she most likely wouldn’t need to use.
