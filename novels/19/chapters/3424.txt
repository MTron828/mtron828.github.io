Chapter 3425: All Killed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han didn’t hesitate at all as he activated Absolute Fairness, The other party had taken the initiative to walk to a distance of nine meters from him, so it was naturally within the range of Absolute Fairness.

He charged out, unleashing the Demonic Monkey Fists. Fifty overlapping layers of power stacked on top of each other.

Even a lion would go all out in a fight with a rabbit. Since he had activated Absolute Fairness, he was going to kill all four elites of the Enlightenment Tier in one go, and definitely would not give any one of them the chance to escape.

He charged out at an incredibly fast speed.

Jin Shaohuang’s expression changed drastically. This was because he discovered that his cultivation level had actually been suppressed to Fifth Extreme.

Fifth Extreme!

He was an Enlightenment Tier elite, and all of a sudden, his cultivation level had been suppressed to the Fifth Extreme, so how could he not panic?

What in the world was going on?

Seeing Ling Han’s punch flying towards him, he didn’t have much time to ponder, and could only wave his palm to greet it.

Peng!

Ling Han threw a punch. With 50 layers of power stacked on top of one another, how terrifying was this? If it wasn’t for the fact that he hadn’t grasped Jin Shaohuang’s attack momentum yet, added with Frequency Attack, the destructive power would be ten to a hundred times greater.

Even so, this wasn’t something that Jin Shaohuang could rival.

At present, he was only a Fifth Extreme, an ordinary Fifth Extreme.

Peng!

With a single punch, he was blasted apart, directly turning into a shower of blood.

F***,so weak?

Ling Han gritted his teeth. However, once he unleashed an attack, he would immediately unleash a devastating attack.

“Die!”

He charged out with the seven Calabash Brothers, while the members of the Jin Clan and Lu Clan were still in a state of dumbfounded shock.

What was going on?

Previously, hadn’t Jin Shaohuang said that Ling Han was only in Extreme Bone Tier? How had he obliterated Jin Shaohuang with a single punch?

How could an Extreme Bone Tier elite be this strong?

They had not even finished this thought, when Ling Han’s attack had already arrived. In an instant, he had pulled the majority of people into the area that was enshrouded by Absolute Fairness.

“Huh? Seventh Change?”

Ling Han shockingly discovered that even his own cultivation level was affected, forcibly suppressed to the Blood Transformation Tier.

It was very simple. There were Blood Transformation Tier elites here, and Absolute Fairness was absolutely fair because it didn’t revolve around the caster.

Ling Han smiled faintly. This was even better.

Everyone was in the Blood Transformation Tier, and he was in the Seventh Change, so his advantage was undoubtedly maximized.

Boom! He unleashed his murderous aura. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Pa, pa, pa, pa! Immediately, a dozen over people fell directly onto the ground, their eyes wide and round, foaming from their mouths. They had directly passed out from the shock. Two of them were even worse off, as they had actually been scared to death.

Even those three Enlightenment Tier elites didn’t look much better, and they all looked dazed.

In the Blood Transformation Tier, who could stand against Ling Han?

Ling Han charged over. Peng, peng, peng! He threw three consecutive punches, and the three Enlightenment Tier elites were easily killed.

This!

Previously, he had considered so much, what kind of ultimate move he needed to use, but in the end?

He didn’t even need to use the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and he had already dealt with them all easily.

“Father, you’ve gone too far,” Eldest Baby grumbled.

“That’s right. Why did you kill all four of the strongest by yourself? You didn’t even leave one for us,” Second Baby said.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Within Absolute Fairness, everyone has been dragged down to the level of Blood Transformation Tier. Enlightenment Tier is no different from Blood Transformation Tier, so there’s no such thing as strong or weak.”

“True.” The seven children looked at each other, and nodded respectively.

They charged out again, and began to reap the harvest.

It wasn’t long before the members of the Jin Clan and Lu Clan were all killed.

Ling Han’s emotions did not waver in the slightest. In the Genesis World, he had long since become accustomed to this kind of scene. However, the seven babies were actually unmoved, as if this was not their first time experiencing this kind of scene.

Only then did his expression change, and he asked, “How are you feeling now?”

“I don’t feel anything.” Eldest Baby spread out her hands.

Seventh Baby said, “There seems to be a vague memory. This kind of scene seemed familiar, but in that kind of memory, the sky is filled with gods, Buddhas, Deities, and not this kind of trash.”

Who exactly were these seven babies?

Ling Han didn’t believe that they had simply popped out of a gourd. Instead, they must have a more complicated background.

However, their memories were already blurry. They only remembered that more than 2000 years ago, there were still people taking care of them, who had still been in the gourd. Beyond that, there was only a complete blank.

Forget it. Perhaps when they grew up a little, their memories would recover.

Ling Han walked to the main doors. There was a formation set up here, and if it was not unlocked accordingly, it would activate the formation, and cause the two stone Bi’an to attack.

He studied it. This formation was extremely complicated, but because it had been too long, or for some other reason, it was already severely damaged, so the difficulty of unravelling it was not high.

Not long after, Ling Han broke into a smile.

“It’s done.”

He gave a light push, and the great doors instantly opened.

Ling Han walked in with the seven babies, and saw that there really was a massive sacrificial altar in this palace. It was high and lofty, and there was a row of over a thousand steps.

Counting, there were 999 steps, and was only a single step away from reaching a thousand.

There were a total of eight tables placed on the sacrificial altar. One was at the top, while the other seven were slightly below.

There were sacrificial offerings laid out on the table. They were all sacred fruits. At least two thousand years had passed, but a refreshing fragrance was still wafting out. Merely smelling it would make one feel as if they were about to ascend and become immortal.

“This is good stuff.” Ling Han rubbed his hands together, but did not advance rashly.

Sixth Baby said that there was still a formation.

He activated his eye technique and carefully observed the surroundings.

This formation was indeed extraordinary. At least for the moment, he had not managed to figure out the slightest detail.

“We can only try with the fat pig.” Ling Han picked up the perverted pig.

The pervert instantly waved his four short legs repeatedly. That would be extremely painful, b@stard.

Pa, Ling Han threw the fat pig out.

However, the strange thing was that no attack was launched.

Ling Han was astounded. Was this formation malfunctioning? But if it was malfunctioning, how could it have any effect on Sixth Baby?

“Father, this formation isn’t meant to attack. Instead, it’s fused with some ancient spirit of the Primitive Age, creating a terrifying pressure that makes it difficult to move,” Sixth Baby explained.

This pressure was obviously ineffective on the fat pig. It slowly got up, then took one step, then two steps, and slowly descended from the steps.

Ling Han found this strange. He also walked forwards, and stepped onto the first step. Suddenly, a mountain of pressure pressed down on him.

In that one instant, he almost knelt down, and the bones in his body crackled.

Gritting his teeth, he took another step forward.

This was great. Instantly, beads of blood seeped out of his skin.

He hurriedly retreated, feeling pain all over his body.

Although his bones hadn’t been shattered, and his internal organs hadn’t been damaged, his skin had been severely damaged. Furthermore, he had only taken two steps at that.

Then what could he do? He couldn’t go up at all, and he couldn’t break through this formation either. How could it be that this was all he could do?

But he couldn’t bear to. Looking at the numerous Treasured Fruits on the sacrificial altar that had remained undamaged even after thousands of years, this alone was enough proof of their extraordinary quality.

Ling Han once again stepped onto the first step, and instantly, pressure assaulted him. He did not move again, but rather forcefully endured this kind of pressure.

He discovered that this could temper his physique..
