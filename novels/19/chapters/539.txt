Chapter 540: Setting Out to the Middle State

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“Could I be so bold to ask... do you perhaps go by the surname Han?” the female atetendant queried.

“I am Han Lin.” Ling Han nodded. He had previously made arrangements with Ying Hong that he would come under the name of Han Lin.

“So you really are Mr Han!” the female attendant looked pleasantly surprised. “Young Mistress has long since been waiting for you! Please come with me. Young Mistress has commanded that the moment Mr Han arrives, we should immediately bring you to her.”

Ling Han nodded, and allowed the female attendant to lead the way.

With the guidance of the female attendant, they soon arrived at the courtyard where Ying Hong was. The female attendant entered first to announce their presence.

“Yo, I say, Mr Han, you are finally here!” Ying Hong appeared, her voluptuous figure extremely captivating, enough to make one drool at the sight of her. She took one look at Helian Xun Xue, and could not help but look stunned. Then, she said, “Young Master Han, you are really very awesome. You’ve just captured my dear Xuan’er, and now, you’ve captured a new girl?”

“Am I Mr Han or Young Master Han?” Ling Han would naturally ignore any private questions, and simply chose to skip over to the next topic.

Yet Ying Hong was not willing to give the matter up and wore a mischievous grin. “Hehe, I’d really like to see how you’re going to explain it to Little Sister Xuan’er later.”

“Is it really an appropriate thing to do for you to sow discord?” Ling Han asked.

“I have big breasts, so of course I can,” this woman said without the slightest hint of shame.

Female hoodlum!

Meanwhile, Helian Xun Xue could not help but look down at her own breasts, and a strange expression appeared on her face. Could it be that it was because her breasts weren’t large enough that Ling Han kept criticizing her? She turned to look once more at Ying Hong. Indeed, those were huge waves, and far from what she could compare to.

Secretly she decided that she would properly train her pectoral muscles in future.

“Come on, Little Sister Xuan Er has already waited for you for a great many days.” Ying Hong changed the subject, her eyes sweeping cunningly over Helian Xun Xue. She seemed to anticipate very much the scene of a daggers-drawn confrontation that would appear after the two girls met.

She led Ling Han and the two girls into the courtyard, then sent someone to call Zhu Xuan Er over.

In a few mere moments, a fragrant breeze swept in. Zhu Xuan Er appeared, her face was once again veiled by her white veil. Though her expression could not be seen, an endless amount of pleasure and surprise could be seen from her gaze alone.

For an outstanding beauty, even a mere look would be enough to captivate a man.

“Big Brother Han!” she called out and took a leap, intending to jump right into Ling Han’s arms.

Pa!

She had not yet landed when both her arms were pulled back at the same time. Furthermore, there was not only one person pulling her back, but two—Hu Niu and Helian Xun Xue.

“I don’t allow you to touch Niu’s Ling Han!” Hu Niu fumed.

“Who are you?” Meanwhile, Helian Xun Xue was sizing Zhu Xuan Er, and the expression on her face was similarly unfriendly. Before they left, Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan had instilled many ideas into her, such as not to allow other women to get near to Ling Han. Otherwise, they would steal Ling Han away!

The moment she opened her eyes, the first person she saw was Lign Han, and like how some animals would think the first living creature they set eyes on when they were born their parent, she also clung close to Ling Han. Thus, she was naturally very careful. She would definitely not allow any woman to steal Ling Han away.

Zhu Xuan Er was shocked. A Hu NIu that got easily jealous was more than enough, why had there appeared another big girl? Also, why were the eyes of this woman blue? They looked weird, but they gave her a captivating air.

“This is Zhu Xuan Er, a friend,” Ling Han said to Helian Xun Xue.

“Oh.” Helian Xun Xue immediately let go, but Hu Niu set herself between Zhu Xuan Er and Ling Han, her face saying ‘don’t think you can get close’.

Zhu Xuan Er could only suppress the longing in her heart and look at Ling Han with a touching gaze.

Really, she was too beautiful. This mere gaze caused waves in Ling Han’s heart, and made him feel an urge to push her down.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, I say, Little Sister Xuan Er, you’re already calling Big Brother so fast?” Ying Hong said from one side, and gave an exaggerated shiver. “I’m about to die from the sappiness.”

“If you don’t speak, nobody’s going to take you for a mute,” Ling Han said, smiling.

“How is it? In my own territory, you will not even allow me to speak?” Ying Hong humphed.

“All right, fine. But shouldn’t we be setting out soon?”

“We’re all just waiting for you. Now that you’re here, let’s set out.”

Though she said that they would set out immediately, they still prepared for a few hours. It was a big matter to set out to the middle state in order to take part in the Spirit Treasures Pavilion Competition, so how could they simply set out just like that? They naturally had to make some preparations beforehand.

Their ride was an extremely lavish carriage. Not only did it contain chairs and beds, it was actually divided into three compartments. By day, they could sit inside the first compartment and chat, and at night, the women would sleep in the second compartment, whereas Ling Han alone occupied the third compartment.

The north region was very, very big. Merely travelling from Extreme Yang City to the border between the north region and the middle state would require over a dozen days, and the middle state was even larger. If one wanted to travel to the headquarters of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion located in the Million Treasures City, that would be another twenty over days of travelling.

The journey would take at least about a month’s time, and this was still because their carriage was extremely fast. Otherwise, if they were using an ordinary carriage, then even if the journey took eight to ten years’ time, don’t begrudge it for being too slow.

However, they had just stepped out of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion when they saw a group of aggressive-looking people blocking their advance.

Ying Hong was surprised. At the entrance to the Spirit Treasures Pavilion, she, the Young Mistress, actually had someone block her way? What was the meaning of this?

“Brat, surrender your life!” When they saw Ling Han walk out, immediately, five shining weapons waved forth.

“How dare you!” When the guard of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion saw this, he immediately moved. With a wave of his sword, ding , ding , ding , the five weapons were all sent flying from their owners’ hands.

When the members of the Zhang Clan saw this, they were instantly displeased and said, “This brat killed our young master. Previously, he kept hiding inside the Spirit Treasures Pavilion. We gave you face and did not charge in to apprehend him, but now that he’s come out, do you all still intend to shelter him?”

The guard of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion merely sneered coldly. What a bunch of idiots. They actually dared to make a move on Young Mistress’s honored guest; they really were tired of living! The Zhang Clan, a clan that merely had Spiritual Ocean Tier cultivators, actually dared to reason things out with the Spirit Treasures Pavilion? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Get lost!” he declared icily, his killing intent on full display. “If you continue pestering, then I’ll kill all of you!”

The members of the Zhang Clan were naturally unwilling to yield, and began to shout.

“Even the Spirit Treasures Pavilion cannot be unreasonable!”

“After killing our young master, you still plan to flee in a grand manner?”

“Hand over the criminal!”

The guard sneered coldly and drew his sword. He said, “What a bunch of reckless, blind idiots!” Shua , shua , shua . After consecutively killing a number of them, those that remained were scared off, and hurriedly turned right around and fled for their lives.

Ling Han and the others did not pay any heed to this. A battle of this level, in their eyes, was only child’s play.

The carriage began to move, advancing towards the middle state.

Ling Han sat down comfortably. Hu Niu sat on his lap, chewing on melon seeds. She guarded him closely, not allowing Zhu Xuan Er the slightest chance to get any nearer.

“At first, I was worried that you would be hunted down by the masses, and would not be able to compete for our side. I did not think that you would actually have this kind of skill.” Ying Hong stared at Ling Han’s face, a shocked expression on her face.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “Has anything big happened recently?”

“Yes, there definitely has!” Ying Hong answered immediately.
