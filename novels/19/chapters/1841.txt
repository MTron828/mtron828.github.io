Chapter 1842: My Fu Clan Will Accept All Challenges

Fu Yan sighed in his mind. In reality, he naturally didn’t want to become enemies with so many three-star forces.

After all, the Fu Clan wasn’t a top-notch three-star force. In fact, just the Lunar Sect alone could already suppress them.

However, in order to butter up to the Roc Palace, he couldn’t abandon his current facade of arrogance and haughtiness. Otherwise, his performance would be lacking in sincerity.

The more difficult it was for him to protect Ling Han, the more it would display the Fu Clan’s unwavering determination.

Of course, Fu Yan was unaware that the Zihe Clan and the Thundercloud Palace still hadn’t received news of their Holy Daughter and Holy Son’s death yet. Otherwise... he would definitely scream that he had been screwed over.

To oppose two Celestial King Tier forces—was this not an act of stupidity?

However, it was a shame that he didn’t know about this. Thus, he continued to resolutely protect Ling Han and butter up to the Roc Palace.

He wore a dignified expression, and he clasped his hands behind his back as he calmly said, “Listen to my advice. Don’t touch a single hair of this person!”

‘What?!’

The Dividing Soul Tier elites were astounded. In fact, some of them even started to doubt their own ears.

Indeed, Fu Yan was more powerful than all of the other cultivators present. However, the Fu Clan wasn’t a clan that could suppress all of their forces. Not only was it also a three-star force, but it was a three-star force that only ranked in the lower quartile.

As such, where was his confidence coming from?

Once the other forces formed an alliance, it was guaranteed that the Fu Clan would be instantly razed to the ground.

In any case, could Fu Yan rival them if they teamed up to attack with their battleships?

Even Ling Han and the Empress were slightly astonished. Not long ago, hadn’t they severed all ties with Fu Gaoyun? That being the case, why had Fu Yan suddenly rushed over to protect them? Moreover, it was as if he were willing to protect them at all costs.

Had he taken the wrong medicine?

Anyhow, Ling Han had initially planned to appear before the Dividing Soul Tier elites before entering the Black Tower to escape. However, since Fu Yan had stepped forward, he was willing to observe the situation first.

“Lord Fu Yan, are you sure you want to do this?” Qianzhao Yu asked. A cold expression had already spread across his face.

He was indeed weaker than Fu Yan. However, the Qianzhao Clan was no weaker than the Fu Clan. Thus, he didn’t need to act in a meek and subservient manner! Moreover, there were many other elites beside him, all of whom were on his side. The Fu Clan was inciting public wrath, and enough ants could even kill an elephant. Not to mention they were a pack of wolves!

The Fu Clan was nothing before them!

Fu Yan’s expression darkened, and he said, “Are you threatening me?” Although he was under immense pressure, could the might of an Immortal Palace Tier elite be challenged by any random person?

‘Regardless of whether I’m in the right or not, since you’re only a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator, you have no option but to cower and be blindly subservient toward me.’

“Lord Fu Yan, do you know what this person has done?” an elite from the Lunar Sect asked. His name was Zhao Lingfeng.

Fu Yan’s heart jolted. One had to realize that the elites before him were all from different forces. Moreover, they were from at least several dozen different forces.

‘What has this brat done?’

He felt a strong urge to slap Ling Han a few times. However, his expression remained calm, and he said, “I genuinely don’t know.”

“He killed the Holy Son of my sect!” Zhao Lingfeng roared.

Dong!

Fu Yan felt as if his heart had been struck by a heavy blow. If it weren’t for his incredible self-control, his expression would have definitely changed drastically, and he might have even exclaimed in astonishment.

‘Brat... you’re far too much of a troublemaker!’

The Lunar Sect was one of the three most powerful sects in this region. Thus, if they truly decided to unleash their full power, they could definitely destroy the entire Fu Clan. Yet, Ling Han had actually killed the Holy Son of such a sect? This...!

Such audacity!

“And the potential successors of my clan as well! Two of them!” Qianzhao Yu said in a menacing voice. He had only received this news just then. Not only had Qianzhao Tian been killed by Ling Han, but even Qianzhao Yang had been killed by him.

This was a blatant provocation toward the Qianzhao Clan. Thus, Qianzhao Yu wouldn’t cower or back down regardless of who stood before him at this moment. This was because he represented the Qianzhao Clan, a powerful three-star force!

As strong as Fu Yan’s self-control was, he still couldn’t help but grimace upon hearing this. ‘How nice... Not only did you offend the Lunar Sect, but you’ve even offended the Qianzhao Clan! Moreover, you’ve killed two of their potential successors. Are you trying to destroy their entire future generation?’

“And the Holy Son of my sect as well!”

“And the potential successor of my clan!”

“And...”

The Dividing Soul Tier elites spoke one after another, revealing Ling Han’s long list of crimes.

‘Holy f*ck!’

At this moment, only these two words remained in Fu Yan’s mind.

He finally recalled the information that he had read before. While Ling Han had still been extremely weak, he had already battled against the Ding Clan and the Xiao Clan. In fact, he had even destroyed the physical body of a prodigy from the Han Clan. He had offended these clans to the extreme.

This was an audacious person, and he had a history of provoking others. His ability to cause trouble was simply through the roof.

‘Grand elder, oh, grand elder, aren’t you screwing me over by telling me to protect this brat? With my skinny arms and skinny legs, how can I withstand the wrath of so many forces?’

As he listened on, Fu Yan’s mind gradually became numb. He was confident that no piece of news could astonish him anymore.

Fu Yan gritted his teeth, and said, “Regardless of what this brat has done... no one is allowed to target him!” In the end, he still had to utter this sentence. However, he felt a slight sense of anticipation because only by saying this could he display the worth of the Fu Clan stepping forward.

‘I’m risking so much, so the Roc Palace has to give something in return, right?’

“Milady, we’re still not going to step forward?” a female knight asked.

The golden female knight of the Roc Palace waved her hand, and said, “We’ll let these clowns perform for a while longer. Anyhow, we’ve already found our target, so there’s no need to hurry.”

“Understood!”

What expression would Fu Yan wear if he heard this exchange? He was performing with all his might, yet he was being viewed as nothing more than a clown. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, this also made sense. After all, did a Celestial King Tier force truly need cannon fodder like him?

Moreover, was the Roc Palace an ordinary Celestial King Tier force? In their eyes, even Celestial Kings beneath the fifth heaven were nothing to worry about. That being the case, how could they care about the Fu Clan?

It was clear that the Fu Clan had chosen the wrong target to butter up to.

The gulf between them and the Roc Palace was far too great, and this was analogous to a village leader buttering up to a supreme emperor. Would the emperor give a damn?

Meanwhile, the elites from the Lunar Sect and the other forces exploded upon hearing Fu Yan’s words. This person had gone f*cking crazy!

If the Fu Clan had been a four-star force, they would have had no option but to concede. However, they were all three-star forces, and the Fu Clan more so ranked in the bottom quartile. Yet, they actually dared to act with such haughtiness and arrogance?

Had the Fu Clan gone mad?

An elite from the Beiyu Clan couldn’t help but warn, “Lord Fu Yan, I’m sure that you’re already aware. We represent 37 different forces, and which of us is weaker than the Fu Clan?” There was a threatening edge to his voice.

However, Fu Yan had already made up his mind. He smiled, and said, “Juniors, I’m actually doing this for your sake! Don’t ruin yourselves!”

Upon hearing this, the Dividing Soul Tier elites couldn’t help but explode with fury. A string of curses raced through their minds.

‘He’s killed our successors, and you’re preventing us from exacting revenge now. Yet, you’re claiming that this is for our own good?!

‘Good your mom!

‘Are you taking us for fools?!’

“Heh, since Lord Fu insists, we naturally don’t dare to do anything now. However, can the Fu Clan withstand the wrath of so many forces?” Zhao Lingfeng said in a menacing voice. To say nothing else of the other forces, just the fury of the Lunar Sect alone was enough to destroy the entire Fu Clan.

Fu Yan flicked his sleeve, and said, “Give me everything you’ve got. My Fu Clan will accept all challenges!”

His voice was filled with confidence and haughtiness.

“Oh? But can you truly accept them?” a cold voice suddenly asked. Everyone looked over, only to see a figure descending from the sky. They were radiating with an aura that was no weaker than that of Fu Yan. In fact, it was significantly more powerful.
