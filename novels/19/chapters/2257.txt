Chapter 2258: Ling Han’s Arrival

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ji Wuming was extremely powerful, truly very powerful. In fact, he had reached a height that even past Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had not managed to reach. However, there was still a huge gulf between the Tenth Secret and the Eleventh Secret.

Those at the Tenth Secret were still Immortal Palace Tier elites, while those at the Eleventh Secret could rival Ascending Origin Tier elites.

Even though Ji Wuming’s strength was heaven-defying, it was still impossible for him to surmount this incredible gulf.

He was immediately pushed onto the back foot, and after 100 or so exchanges, it was already clear that he was struggling. After 200 exchanges, it was only a matter of time before he would be defeated.

“Let’s end it here,” a Celestial King said as he reached out, and separated Chi Xue and Ji Wuming.

This time, the elites from the Foreign Realm didn’t interfere. This was because they had already made a decision to kill Ji Wuming once their reinforcements arrived. In fact, they would kill everyone present.

They had lost this battle, yet the cultivators from the Celestial Realm were still ecstatic.

They had suffered defeat, yet they had also obtained glory!

An Immortal Palace Tier elite losing to an Ascending Origin Tier elite was nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, Ji Wuming being able to withstand so many attacks from Chi Xue was proof of his inconceivable power. Once he advanced to the Eleventh Secret, he would definitely be able to kill Chi Xue with ease.

The Celestial Realm had a bright future ahead of it. Moreover, there was also a Pseudo-Monarch Star like Hu Niu, and there was also a rising star in the Rain Emperor. With Ji Wuming to top them off, the younger generation of the Celestial Realm was no weaker than that of the Foreign Realm. In fact, they were perhaps even superior.

Meanwhile, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm all wore dark expressions. Not only had they failed to lower the Celestial Realm’s morale this time, but they had even managed to boost their confidence instead. This was truly a case of going out for wool and coming back shorn.

Chi Xue wore a cold expression as he gazed at the cultivators from the Celestial Realm. His fighting spirit was burning, and his killing intent was almost tangible. He was incredibly pissed that he had failed to kill Ji Wuming. He wouldn’t be able to suppress his fury unless he killed a few people.

“Who wants to die?” he asked coldly.

No one from the Celestial Realm answered. Right now, no one in the Immortal Palace Tier could rival Chi Xue.

“Ahem.” Ling Han cleared his throat as he stepped forward. It was finally time for him to enter the fray.

“Han Lin, come back!” Nie Heshan hurriedly shouted. He knew that Ling Han was a Monarch Star, yet he was only a measly Second Secret cultivator. Stepping forward was akin to seeking death.

Shen Chao chuckled coldly upon seeing this. Chi Xue was powerful enough to rival him—he naturally wouldn’t admit that Chi Xue was more powerful than him—so Ling Han’s action was indeed no different from seeking death. Although he lusted to kill Ling Han with his own hands, killing a comrade from the Clear Heaven Pass would also cause huge trouble for him. Thus, it was best that he didn’t have to act himself.

The others also shook their heads. What could a measly Second Secret cultivator do? Even if there were 10,000 of them, Chi Xue could easily kill them all with a single press of his finger.

“Hahahaha!” The cultivators from the Foreign Realm roared with laughter. “Even a Second Secret cultivator dares to step forward. Has the Celestial Realm got no one else to send?”

“The super low-level dimension is indeed weak. Even a Second Secret cultivator dares to step forward.”

“You?” Chi Xue glanced at Ling Han before immediately cracking up with laughter. This was a measly Second Secret cultivator. To say nothing of using his hands, just a single glare from him would be enough to suppress this ant. “Piss off!”

His roar boomed like thunder, and it materialized into a gigantic wave of spears.

“Didn’t you want an opponent? I’ll battle against you,” Ling Han said calmly. When he said the word “battle,” it transformed into a glowing golden symbol that soared toward the gigantic wave.

Peng!

The two collided, and the gigantic wave was instantly calmed.

A look of surprise instantly spread across Chi Xue’s face. He carefully looked at Ling Han, and said, “You’re not at the Second Secret!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Who said I was at the Second Secret?” Ling Han said with a smile.

Boom!

His aura started to soar, instantly reaching the Third Secret.

Something like this was possible?

Everyone was astonished. However, a Third Secret cultivator still couldn’t rival an Eleventh Secret elite. This was a paramount rule of the cultivation world—the gulf between these two cultivation levels was immense and insurmountable.

“Still not enough?” Ling Han asked with a smile. His aura shuddered, and he instantly advanced to the next level.

He had advanced to the Fourth Secret.

The onlookers came to a sudden realization. Ling Han had definitely used some kind of secret technique to conceal his true cultivation level. In reality, he was definitely at or above the Tenth Secret. Otherwise, he couldn’t have possibly survived Chi Xue’s roar.

A realization dawned on someone, and they suddenly shouted, “Chicken Slayer!”

The Celestial Realm had a mysterious Monarch Star. They had reached the Tenth Secret, and they had easily defeated Yamu with a single punch. However, he had vanished without a trace afterward, and no one knew who he was.

Now that a mysterious elite had suddenly appeared, and seeing that it was extremely likely that he was at the Tenth Secret, who could he be if not the Chicken Slayer?

Chi Xue frowned upon seeing this. “Stop mucking around. I hate this type of person the most!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “You might hate it, but what’s that got to do with me?”

Boom!

His aura soared again, reaching the Fifth Secret.

“Die!” Chi Xue was unable to tolerate this any longer, and he immediately dashed forward, throwing a punch at Ling Han as he did so.

If Ling Han wanted to, he could kill Chi Xue with a single thought. However, in order to hide the fact that he was the ruler of this realm, he had no option but to reply with a punch of his own.

Peng!

He remained as steady as a mountain, while Chi Xue was sent stumbling back seven steps.

What? Chi Xue had actually been suppressed in a head-on clash?

Not only were the cultivators from the Foreign Realm shocked, but even the cultivators from the Celestial Realm were deeply astonished.

“The Chicken Slayer… is actually this powerful!”

“He’s not at the Tenth Secret, but the Eleventh Secret!”

“Heavens! Our Celestial Realm also has such a supreme Monarch Star!”

Everyone clasped their heads in shock and astonishment. How could they have imagined this? Ling Han wasn’t at the Tenth Secret, but actually at the Eleventh Secret! In fact, his battle prowess was even superior to that of Chi Xue!

Meanwhile, Chi Xue’s eyes widened in shock. He was slightly dumbfounded, and he was barely able to believe what he was seeing.

His encounter with Ji Wuming had already been shocking enough. Fortunately, he had been one minor level above Ji Wuming, so he had still been able to suppress him using this advantage. This allowed him to maintain his feeling of superiority. Now, however, this feeling of superiority was shattered into smithereens.

Not only was Ling Han at the same cultivation level as him, but his battle prowess was even superior.

‘How is this possible?!’

He was the descendent of Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan, and the ancestral blood that flowed through him was extremely thick. Apart from fellow descendants of the Heavenly Venerate, he should have been invincible at the same cultivation level!

Was this truly a f*cking super low-level dimension?

Ling Han roared with laughter. With a single thought, he instantly unleashed the powerful aura of an Eleventh Secret elite.

Since he wanted to ensnare and kill the Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm, he naturally had to put on a good show. He pointed at Chi Xue, and roared, “Red-haired monkey, you dare to battle me?”

‘Red-haired monkey?’

Chi Xue instantly flared up in rage. However, he would rather battle against an Eleventh Secret Ji Wuming than Ling Han as this person simply spoke too much. Moreover, his words were all filled with barbs that were sharp enough to make one vomit blood before even engaging in battle.

If Ling Han’s battle prowess had been inferior, he could have at least destroyed him in an instant. That way, he could spare himself from the pain of listening to Ling Han’s toxic nonsense. However, Ling Han’s battle prowess was clearly superior, so he naturally couldn’t shut him up at all.

“Come battle!” He didn’t want to speak anymore, and with a bound, he immediately charged toward Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han casually exchanged blows with Chi Xue. He was the ruler of this heaven and earth, so if he battled here, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be no match for him. This wasn’t a brag; it was the simple truth. However, in order to trick the Foreign Realm, he still acted as if Chi Xue was extremely powerful, and that he was only a tiny bit stronger.

Even so, this small advantage still allowed Ling Han to quickly gain the upper hand. Gradually, this upper hand transformed into a crushing advantage.

The cultivators from the Foreign Realm were all speechless and gaping in shock.

Chi Xue was the most powerful Eighth Lotus Monarch Star, yet even he was unable to rival Ling Han. In other words, the remaining Eighth Lotus cultivators would all be defenseless against Ling Han.

No, they couldn’t accept this.

“Chi Xue, you definitely have to win!”

“Combust your ancestral bloodline! You’re the descendant of Lord Chi Yan!”

The cultivators from the Foreign Realm all shouted in unease.
