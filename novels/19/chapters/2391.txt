Chapter 2392: Seventh Level

Ling Han carefully examined the Tenth Refinement alchemical pill, and expressions of understanding and realization would occasionally flash across his face.

He had already reached the Ninth Refinement long ago. However, after such a long time, he was still unable to reach the Tenth Refinement. Thus, he was unable to become a Five-Star Alchemist. This was mainly because he had never seen a Tenth Refinement alchemical pill before. As such, he had needed to explore everything by himself.

Now that there was a Tenth Refinement alchemical pill before him, he could naturally examine it and attain endless enlightenment.

While Ling Han was busy examining the alchemical pill, Wally had already removed the restrictions of the second building. Just like the first building, this building was mostly filled with alchemical pills. However, a majority had already been taken by the ancestor of the Kong Clan.

Just like the first building, there were also few Tenth Refinement alchemical pills here—there were only a measly two. However, they were both Four-Star alchemical pills, and they weren’t at the Celestial King Tier.

Ling Han only took the Tenth Refinement alchemical pills. They were extremely useful to him.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was giddy with excitement as he fervently ran around collecting the alchemical pills. However, his speed couldn’t compare to that of Hu Niu and the others, so he could only shout, “Leave some for me! Leave some for me!”

At the same time, he couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. “If it weren’t for that bastard, I would have already become a Celestial King!”

There were countless alchemical pills here, and his cultivation aptitude wasn’t poor, either. Thus, it was extremely likely that he could have indeed become a Celestial King.

However, Ling Han retorted, “The Celestial Path only opens once every 10 billion years. Even if you had obtained this treasure chamber, you’d still only have been toiling along at the Ascending Origin Tier.”

“Will it kill you not to taunt me?!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire asked in irritation. Why did this brat enjoy taunting him so much? Was it just because he toyed with him when passing down his mystical powers at that time?

Ling Han responded with a hearty laugh.

Meanwhile, the ancestor of the Kong Clan was on the verge of mental collapse. He had spent billions of years to empty half of this building. Now, however, Ling Han and the others had easily removed the restrictions. By the looks of it, they were truly going to empty this building in just a single day.

This stark contrast truly drove him crazy.

A cold chill enveloped his body. This was because he had already become useless. There was nothing he could use to bargain. If Ling Han and the others wanted to kill him, they would no longer need to hesitate.

Sure enough, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire looked over. He was naturally the one who hated the ancestor of the Kong Clan the most. Not only had this person snatched his opportunity, but he had even pushed him to the verge of death.

“Hehe, we can calmly discuss things. I can return all of the alchemical pills and treasures that I took,” the ancestor of the Kong Clan said with a hurried chuckle. He didn’t want to die at all.

“I. Don’t. Need. Them!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire said word by word. He reached over and made a slapping motion.

Pa!

The ancestor of the Kong Clan was instantly flattened into a bloody pancake.

Wally was definitely like a hard-working ox. He was plowing the field with no complaints at all. Before long, he had already removed the restrictions from six of the buildings. However, he stopped when he arrived at the seventh and final building.

“This… is an absolute restriction. It can only be removed by brute strength,” he said.

Ling Han and the others were collecting treasures slower than he was removing the restrictions. Thus, they didn’t pay any attention to this. Instead, they all headed to the third building.

Just like the first two buildings, this building also mainly consisted of alchemical pills.

When they arrived at the fourth building, they finally discovered some precious tools.

There were all kinds of precious tools, though the large majority of them had already been taken. However, there wasn’t any Celestial Tool. They truly wondered what kind of grand fortune the ancestor of the Kong Clan had struck to obtain the Green Song Divine Sword.

The fifth building was much like the fourth building. However, after arriving at the sixth building, they finally discovered Divine Metal!

This was a fist-sized hunk of purple metal. It was shimmering with color, and it looked as attractive as could be.

“Purple Sun Heavenly Celestial Metal!” Ling Han exclaimed.

“Divine Metal?” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire asked in excitement.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “Yes, Divine Metal!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He had to admit that Wally was truly an honest person. Unbelievably honest, in fact. He had been the first to discover this Divine Metal, yet he actually hadn’t taken it away in secret.

After jumping around in excitement for a while, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire shook his head, and said, “Forget about it. It’s better if you give me a few Ascending Origin Tier precious tools. Otherwise, I’m not powerful enough to possess such a treasure, either. If I reveal it, I’ll definitely be robbed.”

This was the brutal truth. If one weren’t powerful enough, yet they possessed an incredible treasure, they would essentially be inviting others to rob them.

Moreover, to the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, obtaining Pseudo-Celestial Tools at the Immortal Palace Tier was naturally better at this moment. After all, he could unleash their full might.

Ling Han was slightly confused at this moment. He had initially thought that the original owner of this place was a Five-Star Alchemist. Now, however, it appeared like they were extremely skilled at tool refinement as well. Such a prodigy was extremely rare.

There had been a Celestial Tool here, the one that had been taken by the ancestor of the Kong Clan. It was now in Ling Han’s hands. At the same time, there had also been three Five-Star alchemical pills. It was unlikely that the ancestor of the Kong Clan had obtained any.

After collecting all the treasures, they arrived before the seventh and final building.

The seven stars gathered, and this building was the central star.

“You can’t remove this restriction?” Ling Han asked Wally.

“No,” Wally replied with a shake of his head. “If one’s power doesn’t exceed the strength of the restriction, then there’s no way to remove it. However, if one’s power exceeds it, the absolute restriction will obliterate everything in the building.”

Ling Han was extremely curious at this moment. Of the seven buildings, three housed alchemical pills, while three housed precious tools. Among them, there were Celestial King Tier alchemical pills and also Celestial King Tier tools. That being the case, what did this carefully protected building hold?

They walked in a circle around the building. However, even Wally couldn’t remove the restriction here, so they naturally couldn’t do anything, either. After circling the building a few more times, they could only sigh in resignation.

However, it was at this moment that Qing Qing walked over. She extended her small arm, and stroked the wall of the building.

This young girl couldn’t cause any damage to the building, and the restriction of the building only targeted the building itself anyway. Thus, her stroking the wall wouldn’t lead to any danger, and Ling Han and the others let her be.

“Even though there’s still one building left, we’ve already collected quite the astonishing amount of treasures,” Ling Han said with a nod. He had obtained several Tenth Refinement alchemical pills, which would greatly aid him in his endeavor to become a Five-Star Alchemist.

Everyone nodded in agreement. They couldn’t remove the restriction, so what else could they do?

“Let’s go.”

They turned around and prepared to leave. However, after taking just a few steps, they suddenly heard a cracking sound traveling over from behind them.

They turned around, only to see a web of cracks on the exterior of the seventh building.

These cracks weren’t on the building itself, but rather on its exterior. It was as if the air had solidified, and was now cracking.

With a pop, the air crumbled apart like shattering crystals.

“The restriction… is broken?” everyone exclaimed in astonishment.

Just then, they had still claimed that this restriction couldn’t be broken. Otherwise, if it were, it would destroy everything in the building. Now, however, the restriction had been broken, and the building was still fine?

They all looked toward Wally.

However, Wally also wore a confused expression. His eyes flashed, and it was clear that he was performing furious calculations. He also couldn’t understand this situation.

The restriction had genuinely been broken. However, no other reaction followed.

“Could it be because of Qing Qing?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

They all looked toward Qing Qing. However, they immediately shook their heads. No matter how they looked at her, this young girl didn’t appear to possess any unique ability.

“Since the restriction has been removed, let’s go in and take a look,” Ling Han said. He retrieved his Divine Demon Sword as he walked over. He couldn’t use the Black Tower, one of his biggest defensive trump cards, now. Thus, he naturally couldn’t be careless facing the unknown.

“Be careful!” the Empress warned in concern.

Ling Han nodded in acknowledgment. He then grabbed Wally over, and held him in front like a shield. Even Celestial Kings couldn’t kill Wally, so he was naturally fit to be used as a shield.

Everyone was rendered speechless.
