Chapter 3487: Fifth level of Celestial Path

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xin Ruyue naturally saw this scene as well, and couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression.

Her palm strike actually did not cause the slightest injury to that child?

Strange, too strange!

However, she also knew that Ling Han was not to be trifled with. Once he used the formation, he could pull his opponent to the same cultivation level, and in a battle of equal cultivation levels, how could she be a match for Ling Han?

Without hesitation, she turned around and fled.

“Still trying to flee?” Princess Bixiao humphed coldly, and gave chase madly. Previously, she had misunderstood Ling Han, and was also enraged because of Xin Ruyue’s actions. Now, this fury was naturally all directed at Xin Ruyue.

She was a Mystery Realm Tier, the strongest below Celestial Path.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! In just a few steps, she had caught up to Xin Ruyue, and stared coldly at her.

Xin Ruyue was greatly astonished. She had not thought that Princess Bixiao, who looked to be even younger than herself, actually had a higher cultivation level than herself.

Though she was very strong, and had the aptitude to be invincible among her peers, she had not reached the extent that she could still match Ling Han, capable of matching an opponent superior by a major tier in cultivation level.

If she battled a Mystery Realm Tier, she would definitely lose.

Thus, she immediately smiled, and said, “I am Xin Ruyue, and my Master, the Primordial True Lord, is a Spirit Transformation Tier elite.”

If these words were said to anyone in the prison, the latter would definitely shiver, and even tremble in fear.

However, Princess Bixiao didn’t know what level Spirit Transformation Tier was on the Celestial Path, so she only acted as if she hadn’t heard anything. She simply looked coldly at Xin Ruyue.

Xin Ruyue couldn’t help but feel gloomy. It was really troublesome to communicate with these natives.

She could only explain, “My Master is already standing on the fifth level of Celestial Path. Even in prison, he is still an elite of the highest tier! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Only now did Princess Bixiao get a shock. The fifth level on the Celestial Path? After such a long time, she had indeed gained some understanding of the elites that had suddenly appeared. She knew that in this world, there was still a massive prison that was being suppressed, and there were countless elites.

But only now did she know that the strongest elite was actually standing on the fifth level of the Celestial Path.

This was too shocking.

Killing an Enlightenment Tier elite wouldn’t be difficult for her, but if the Primordial True Lord behind this woman was drawn out, what would happen?

So what if it was Chen Fengyan? Would he be able to withstand the fury of a Spirit Transformation Tier elite?

“So, you can do as you like?” Ling Han walked over, flames of fury burning in his eyes. “She’s just a child, and there’s no animosity between you and her, yet you can ruthlessly use her as hostage, and even kill her. Just how deranged are you?”

■’Hand over what I want. Otherwise, when my Master appears, this world will be overthrown, and you will have nowhere to hide!” Xin Ruyue declared proudly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “As a man, 1 should be quick to repay debts of gratitude and revenge. Being overcautious, what need is there for me to be a cultivator?”

He moved, launching an attack at Xin Ruyue.

As long as Ling Han didn’t use Absolute Fairness, Xin Ruyue naturally wouldn’t be afraid of Ling Han. After all, Ling Han was only at the Extreme Bone Tier, so how powerful could he be?

With a soft exclamation, she brandished her twin whips, which wrapped around Ling Han.

Ling Han clenched his fists, and struck the whip harshly.

Peng, his fists landed on the whip, and the whip instantly fell like a spirit snake that had been struck at its weak point. However, Ling Han’s fists were also left with two bloody marks, and his skin was cracked.

Thankfully, his bones had undergone seven transformations, and were incredibly tough.

“What?!” Xin Ruyue’s expression changed drastically. She had used her full power in this strike, yet it had only broken the skin of Ling Han’s fists, and not shattered his fists as she had expected?

This guy’s strength had improved again, and it was a qualitative change at that!

How could there be such a freakish Extreme Bone Tier elite?

She put away a whip, and with the instillation of mystical power, the remaining whip immediately stood upright like a long spear. She gripped it with both hands, and swept it towards Ling Han, shockingly changing the method of attack.

Shua, shua, shua! She continuously stabbed with her whip-spear. The tail was indeed incredibly sharp, exuding a cold light. If one was pierced once, it would definitely not be a pleasant experience.

Ling Han summoned his battle hammer and clashed head-on with the whip-spear. Meanwhile, his left hand clenched into a fist and shot out a punch at Xin Ruyue. Peng, peng, peng! With the Demonic Monkey Fists combined with Frequency Attack, he was just barely able to stand against Xin Ruyue.

Zi, blazing white lightning flashed, and the battle hammer showed its might. This was a One Star Spirit Tool, and as Ling Han advanced into Seventh Extreme, the might he could unleash naturally increased greatly. In fact, it was even close to Mystery Realm Tier.

Xin Ruyue tried her best to resist, but her own battle prowess was not much higher than Ling Han’s, and she was at too much of a disadvantage when it came to Spirit Tool. No matter what she did, she was unable to turn the tables. Within a few moves, the lightning had burnt her clothes, and her hair was disheveled, making her appear extremely disheveled.

Xin Ruyue roared in fury. It was not that her battle prowess was inferior, but rather that her Spirit Tool was inferior. This made her feel very wronged.

“Ling Han, you’re relying on your Spirit Tool to suppress me, so it doesn’t count as your skill at all!” she called out loudly. She was naturally provoking Ling Han. Although it might not be effective, she had no other ideas.

Ling Han scoffed, “You are an Enlightenment Tier elite, two major tiers higher than me in cultivation level, and you have the nerve to say that I am relying on a Spirit Tool to suppress you? Furthermore, you used a young child as hostage, and your attacks are even crueler, and still want me to treat you fairly?

He brandished the battle hammer even faster. Zi, zi, zi, lightning flashed madly, filling the surrounding space.

Xin Ruyue could only dodge this way and that. If the Primordial True Lord wasn’t in a prison, but was instead the true leader of a sect, then she would definitely have a One Star Spirit Tool in her possession.

However, the prison was extremely short of resources. The two whips in her hands had been obtained with great difficulty, and she still wanted a One Star Spirit Tool?

The more she fought, the more flustered she became. Under the suppression of a One Star Spirit Tool, she would lose sooner or later.

Losing at the hands of Ling Han, then what would happen to her?

Die.

She did not want to die, so she naturally wanted to struggle desperately. ■’Are you going to stand by and watch as he kills me?” Xin Ruyue shouted at Princess Bixiao. “If I die here, when my master escapes, with his strength, he’ll be able to easily trace back time and see through today’s events.” Princess Bixiao faltered for a moment before realizing that she had been threatened. She couldn’t help but be stunned. She hadn’t imagined that Xin Ruyue would be so tasteless. “Despicable!” she said in a low voice.

■■If you leave me to die, you’ll definitely suffer the fury of my master. No matter what force you’re backed by, you’ll only be reduced to ashes,” Xin Ruyue threatened.

Thoughts streaked through Princess Bixiao’s mind, and she suddenly moved, joining the battle.

She did not attack Ling Han, but rather shot out a palm strike at Xin Ruyue.

She was a Mystery Realm Tier elite, and a prodigy at that. Her battle prowess was far above that of Xin Ruyue. Moreover, Xin Ruyue was already struggling under Ling Han’s barrage of attacks, so with such a powerful opponent, how was she supposed to resist?

in an instant, she was in a perilous situation, almost consigned to eternal damnation.

■■You-” Xin Ruyue didn’t expect that she would become the victim of her own cleverness. Not only did she fail to get Princess Bixiao to help her, she instead became her curse.

“Shameless brat,” Princess Bixiao said coldly, her attacks becoming even more rapid..
