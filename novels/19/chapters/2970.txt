2971 Forced to show his true colors

Ling Han casually waved his hand, and xiu, Liu Jun and the others flew into the sky, instantly disappearing without a trace.

‘F*ck!’

Everyone was gaping in shock. Those were three Dividing Soul Tier elites, and they had actually been sent flying with a single wave?

It should be known that Ma Bang, who had been the first to be sent flying, had not come back even now. Where had he been sent flying to?

Cheng Sisi also looked at Ling Han in shock. At first, she had thought that Ling Han was only a fifth severance grand elder. At most, he would only be a Dividing Soul Tier. Though this could be considered an elite cultivator in Peaceful Leaf City, this could not be considered to be in the top tier.

However, she now knew that she had been wrong.

This should be a great elite of Immortal Palace Tier. Perhaps Lord Zhu Mang himself would have to personally come out to suppress him.

The remaining four Severing Mundane Tiers dispersed in fright. This was a serious matter, so they naturally had to ask Zhu Mang to come.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and suddenly came to an enlightenment. However, he sat down in a cross-legged position.

He attempted to touch the fourth fundamental particle of heaven and earth. If he could advance to the Fifth Tier in a single stroke, that would really be great news.

Ling Duanyun, Cheng Sisi, and the others were all astounded, thinking that Ling Han was really so relaxed. After beating others up, he actually sat back down, looking as if nothing had happened.

Meanwhile, Gou Li’s expression became uglier and uglier. The greater Ling Han’s strength, the more anxious he felt, constantly worrying that something would happen.

Very soon, half a day had passed, and even more elites had arrived.

Everyone had heard that a young man had modified Zhu Mang’s sword technique, greatly increasing its might. Furthermore, he had sent three Dividing Soul Tiers and one Severing Mundane Tier into who knew where with a wave of his hand, and they had not returned even now.

This kind of intelligence and this kind of strength were truly astonishing, such that even those great elites of Immortal Palace Tier could no longer sit still.

Moreover, with such a big commotion, Zhu Mang definitely couldn’t sit still, and would personally step out. Everyone wanted to see how much Zhu Mang had improved after so many years.

Even though everyone respected Zhu Mang, Zhu Mang’s status was too out of the ordinary. What if his personality suddenly changed one day, and he had ambitions for power?

Then he would be a powerful enemy.

“So that is Han Lin?”

“It is said that he came with a junior of the Ling Clan.”

“Go and call that brat over, and ask him about the situation.”

These great elites were very interested in Ling Han, and wanted to call Ling Duanyun over to ask about the situation, but Ling Duanyun ignored all of them.

In the end, it was still the Cheng Clan that was clever, and sent Cheng Sisi to ask him about it. This caused Ling Duanyun to reveal some secrets, but not too much.

“Ling Duanyun, come here!” someone shouted at Ling Duanyun.

Ling Duanyun took a look, and hurriedly ran over. He said respectfully, “Duanyun pays his respects to Third Elder.”

This was an old man, putting on airs. He nodded slowly, and then said, “Are you an idiot? That person has already attracted the calamity of death, and you are still with him? Aren’t you afraid that the Ling Clan will be consigned to eternal damnation as well? Idiot, you are extremely stupid!”

Ling Duanyun hurriedly said, “Third Elder, this person has quite a deep relationship with our Ling Clan.”

“So what? Right now, he’s already become the target of the public. We have to stay as far away from him as possible, understand?!” Third Elder rebuked.

Ling Duanyun shook his head internally, and secretly thought that Third Elder was short-sighted.

However, this was also in line with Third Elder’s character. That was because he was resolute in changing his surname, and thought that the surname Ling had brought them too much misfortune. Only by abandoning this surname would they have a chance of rising again.

Thus, as long as Ling Han was related to the Ling Clan, he would naturally want to reject him as much as possible. How could he be happy that his clan could possibly get a strong helper?

He knew some secrets. To say nothing of Immortal Palace Tier elites, even a Celestial King might be unable to save the Ling Clan, so it would be better to draw a clear dividing line between them.

“Just obediently stand here,” Third Elder said again.

Ling Duanyun nodded. He wasn’t worried about Ling Han at all.

After another while, a middle-aged man appeared. He was filled with an elegant bearing, looking like a pedant who had read a lot. He did not have the slightest bit of the ferocity of a cultivator, yet was still an Immortal Palace Tier.

“Greetings, Lord Zhu!” Many people clasped their hands respectfully. Some people even knelt down, their expressions reverent.

This was Zhu Mang, the founder of the Jian Nan Martial Academy and one of the strongest elites in Peaceful Leaf City

Perhaps the words “one of” could be omitted because there had long been rumors that he could advance to the Ascending Origin Tier at any time.

Zhu Man nodded at the people around him. Then, he focused his eyes on Ling Ling Han.

“Sir, have we met before?” he asked.

Ling Han opened his eyes. He sighed. Though he had suddenly come to an enlightenment, he had still not managed to touch the fourth fundamental particle yet.

No wonder it was said that advancing from the Fourth Tier to the Fifth Tier was the most difficult. Even those like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu had all spent around an epoch’s time. In fact, they had only broken through after receiving a Great Herb from the Genesis World of the last era, which showed how difficult it was to complete this step.

Ling Han glanced at Zhu Mang, and his gaze suddenly became harsh. Killing intent rose within him, but he quickly withdrew it. “We have never met before.”

“Then it is impossible that we have any enmity?” Zhu Mang continued to ask.

“We indeed do not,” Ling Han replied with a shake of his head.

“Then why did you attack my disciples?” Zhu Mang suddenly questioned, looking righteous.

If it was another person, they might be conquered by his aura. ‘That’s right, there was no animosity between us, so why did you send his disciple flying?’ If one was suppressed in terms of aura, battle prowess would definitely be affected.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “There is no animosity between you and me, but your master is a great enemy of mine, and I will not rest until your master is dead.”

When these words fell, it instantly caused an uproar among the masses.

Master? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What did Ling Han mean? Wasn’t Zhu Mang a lone cultivator? Why was Ling Han bringing up Zhu Mang’s master, then?

Zhu Mang was initially calm and composed, but when he heard these words, his expression changed drastically, and his heart beat like a drum. He forcibly calmed down. “Absolute nonsense!”

“Is that so?” Ling Han shook his head. “Then I’ll force you to reveal your true form.”

With a light wave of his hand, he delivered a palm strike at Zhu Mang.

Peng!

Zhu Mang hurriedly counterattacked. The two of them exchanged a blow, yet it resulted in a tie.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and delivered another palm strike. This time, his power was much greater, surpassing the level of the Immortal Palace Tier.

“What!?” Sensing the terror of Ling Han’s attack, those great elites of Immortal Palace Tier all exclaimed in shock, their eyes wide.

This was actually an Ascending Origin Tier elite?

“Ascending Origin Tier!”

“Heavens, Peaceful Leaf City has actually produced an Ascending Origin Tier great elite!”

Among the exclamations of these Immortal Palace Tier elites, Cheng Sisi’s beautiful eyes involuntarily widened. She had always been a proud little princess, thinking that no one was worthy of her, but now, compared with Ling Duanyun, it was as if she was the ugly duckling.

However, what was even more shocking was Zhu Mang.

He also shot out a strike, which blocked Ling Han’s palm strike again.
