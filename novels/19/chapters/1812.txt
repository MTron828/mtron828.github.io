Chapter 1813: So many people!

Beautiful women were all conceited.

Especially an exquisite seductive beauty like Bewitching Maiden Rou, who was confident that none could match her. It was practically a fantasy for her to admit that her beauty was inferior to another woman’s.

But when she saw the Empress, Bewitching Maiden Rou did not have the slightest bit of self-confidence. She could not help but admit that the latter was indeed much more beautiful than she was.

It was not being just a slight bit more beautiful than her, but a crushing victory, and she couldn’t even find the slightest bit of excuse—like her breasts were not as shapely as hers, her hips not as flaring as hers, or her waist not as slender as hers.

Everything of the Empress was perfection itself.

Furthermore, her bearing was really too powerful. She was as noble as a divine maiden that others could only admire from afar but dared not to commit sacrilege.

“Big... Sister!” Bewitching Maiden Rou involuntarily called out, but the moment the words left her mouth, she hurriedly shut her mouth. How could she have compromised?

The Empress nodded, and said, “Since you have called me your big sister, you are a member of the Ling Clan from now onwards.”

‘Hey, hey, hey, you are talking on your own here, right?’

Bewitching Maiden Rou hurriedly waved a hand in denial, and protested, “Miss—”

“Call Big Sister!” the Empress corrected.

Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but become speechless. ‘Even if you are as beautiful as a fairy, you can’t be unreasonable.’

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Excuse me, excuse me.”

At first, Bewitching Maiden Rou was very wary about the two of them, and now she was further intimidated by the Empress’s exquisite beauty, so she was naturally unwilling to travel with them. When she heard his words, she made the move to step out of their way.

Ling Han pulled the Empress with him, while the latter complained, “Husband, she is a Nine Revolutions Charm Physique, she cannot be allowed to benefit another!”

With her domineering attitude, these words were not said softly, but rather loud enough for the Bewitching Maiden Rou to hear them clearly.

Bewitching Maiden Rou almost stumbled and fell onto the ground, her pretty face twitching slightly. At this point, she really had no idea what she should say.

Ling Han only offered a dry laugh in her direction, and pulled the Empress away from him.

“Rascal!” Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but spit out.

‘What does it have to do with me?’

Ling Han felt wronged. He did not have any ideas at all, so why was it he that had become the rascal now? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

‘You Bewitching Maiden, believe it or not, I will smack your behind?’ This thought flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help but hiss. Unconsciously, he had again been affected by this bewitching maiden’s charm techniques.

This Bewitching Maiden Rou’s charm was indeed inferior to the Empress’, but it had an imperceptible influence. Every single time he saw her, his self-control would weaken slightly.

Demon, she really was a demon!

At first, Ling Han had wanted to rectify his own name, yet now he had lost the interest to even talk. He simply tugged on the Empress and walked off.

Seeing them walk farther and farther away, Bewitching Maiden Rou’s heart moved slightly. She had already walked in circles around this place for more than three days, but still had not found the way to leave. Though the lifespan of a Celestial was unlimited, time could not be wasted for nothing like this, either.

Moreover, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm would be open for around 10 years. By then, that volcano would go back to normal, and this place would turn back into a place that was diffused with killing intent.

She instinctively thought that Ling Han and the Empress had found the way out. Though she thought that this kind of deduction was a little rash, since she could not find the way out on her own, why shouldn’t she follow others?

With such thoughts, she followed behind Ling Han and the Empress, keeping quite a distance. However, with how wide her divine sense could stretch out, it was definitely impossible for her to lose track of them.

Half a day later, a person suddenly walked out from the oblique side.

“Yi, Fairy Rou!” that person called out in pleasant surprise.

This person was Beiyu Xiong.

Bewitching Maiden Rou nodded at the other. The aim of the Purity Sect was that anything that could be resolved verbally definitely should not be resolved with brute force. However, her feet did not stop moving. If she paused, Ling Han and the Empress could possibly walk out of the range of her divine sense.

Beiyu Xiong hurriedly followed. Faced with such an exquisite seductive beauty like Bewitching Maiden Rou, there was probably no one that could maintain a heart of stone and become angered.

It was really very coincidental. Not long after, they bumped into another person.

This time, it was Lin Fang. She had also passed the previous test, and managed to enter into this place, but the more she walked, the more she was unable to find the way out. Now that she had bumped into the others, she immediately felt an enthusiasm that came from meeting old friends in a foreign place, and walked onwards with them.

Then, they encountered Qianzhao Tian, as well as Teng Sen. Their numbers became larger and larger.

Ling Han realized that more and more people were following behind him, but did not deliberately take a wrong turn. He was sure that if this fated opportunity belonged to him, then no one could possibly take it away from him.

He was that confident!

His mind became clearer and clearer. After walking for a while longer, light suddenly appeared ahead of him, and a peach tree appeared.

It was not strange for peach trees to be here, but this one was slightly different because it was growing all by its lonesome. There was not a single peach tree in its surroundings, and this peach tree was extremely old. There was an old hollow that was big enough for one to pass through in the trunk. Just a bit larger, and the whole tree would be broken.

Even now, it was only connected by slivers of bark, and one would feel worry just by looking at it.

‘So this is the place?’

Ling Han was surprised. From the results of his calculations, this should be the finishing line, or where the great fortune was located, but he had not thought that it was another peach tree here. However, this one was clearly different from the norm, which was enough proof that his calculations had been correct.

Still, what did this mean?

Luo Changfeng held a map in his hands, but this was no ordinary map. There were two blinking spots of light on the map. One was immobile, while the other was moving.

...The spot of light that was not moving was the destination, while the other spot of light represented his current location.

“Tens of billions of years ago, Lord Sect Master entered into this place, and discovered the Heavenly Dao Source Rock. At first, he had wanted to take it with him, but then he realized that the Heavenly Dao Source Rock has already fused into one with the environment of this place, and had thus given up the idea.

“After so many years, the Heavenly Dao Source Rock has already evolved into the Heavenly Dao Jade, and this is the time to take it!

“Lord Sect Master favors me deeply, and has bestowed on me a treasure so that I can follow the clues. This time, the Heavenly Dao Jade will definitely become mine!

“However, the ancestor of the Ziyun Clan also entered this place at that time, and a fierce battle even erupted between him and Lord Sect Master for the sake of the Divine Metal, so he must know that this place contains the Heavenly Dao Jade.

“This kind of treasure does not have much benefit for anyone above Dividing Soul Tier. Thus, Lord Sect Master did not move out personally, but instead sent me alone to enter this place. This is a test for me.

“Therefore, I must definitely get hold of the Heavenly Dao Jade!”

Luo Changfeng’s eyes shone. “The Heavenly Dao Jade can mend any holes in Heavenly Dao, making up for the imperfections before the Severing Mundane Tier, and allow one to become a king among kings! And for me, the Heavenly Dao Jade can grant me a sliver of a chance to become a fifth severance!

“Fifth severance, a domain that even Lord Sect Master has not touched!”

Even Luo Changfeng’s hand that was holding the map trembled slightly. Fifth severance was only a myth even among Celestial King Tier forces. Just looking at the innumerable Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, generation after generation, which one of them had actually attained the fifth severance?

As far as he knew, not even one!

To say nothing of these ordinary Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, even among those Holy Sons and Holy Daughters that had eventually become Celestial Kings, none of them had attained fifth severance, either.

This was a forbidden domain, and even Celestial Kings would have to look up at anyone who had attained it.

But Heavenly Dao Jade... could defy nature and change one’s fate!

He was a king among kings, so he only had to refine the Heavenly Dao Jade, and he would be qualified to break through to fifth severance. Though it only meant that he had gained the qualification, and increased his chances slightly, and perhaps might have just increased his chances from zero to one in 10,000, but at least a bit of hope could be seen.

“The only thing I have to worry about is Zihe Bingyun. She must also have come for the Heavenly Dao Jade!” Luo Changfeng murmured as he continued to study the map. The two spots of light on the map had already overlapped one another.

Light suddenly appeared ahead of him, and Luo Changfeng’s expression suddenly became incredibly colourful.

F***, why were there so many people?
