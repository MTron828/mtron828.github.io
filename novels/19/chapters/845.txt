Chapter 846: An Earth-Shattering Secret

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

All lands under the heavens were under the Imperial Authority!

The world was mine! You were in my turf, yet wanted to come and go freely as you please? What a joke!

Ling Han stretched out his hand and pressed, immediately drawing forth countless currents of air. They began slicing towards Xiao Miaoyan, akin to a series of Divine Swords.

This was not his battle prowess, but rather the use of the power of nation.

Theoretically speaking, as long as he was in command of the Great Ling Empire, he could barrage any corner within the territory via totems. But, this would require a tremendously strong mental energy to support it—even if Ling Han’s spirit had already advanced to the Shattering Void Tier earlier than expected, it still could not reach infinite boundaries.

But Xiao Miaoyan was just ten li in front of him; if he could not control anything even at such short distance, then he was too useless, and the power of nation too meaningless.

Pu!

Xiao Miaoyan immediately got hit; however, with just the power of nation, it was only nine Stars of Shattering Void Tier, at most ten Stars’ strength, and that was not enough to pose a threat to her. It merely managed to rip a tiny bit of the hem of her clothes, though also compelled her to strike back some to counter the blows.

After all, she did not have the physique of a monster—how would she dare to forcefully take the attacks head on?

As a result, her speed was naturally affected somewhat.

Ling Han smiled, and raised his hands. Countless swords of air slashed over towards Xiao Miaoyan once more.

He was also racing against time.

The power of nation was naturally almost inexhaustible, but the strength channeled from the Black Tower could only last an hour. If he could not catch up to Xiao Miaoyan and kill her within this period of time, then he would have to give up the chase.

With just the power of nation, he was not Xiao Miaoyan’s match. After all, the gap in their actual level was practically too wide.

Pu, pu, pu , Xiao Miaoyan brandished her sword, ceaselessly striking the swords of air that came shooting at her, and sent them flying. However, she was astonished to discover that Ling Han was drawing closer and closer.

In desperation, she no longer bothered with these swords of air, and merely resorted to guarding her vital parts with Origin Power while fleeing for life with all her strength.

Although this move of hers caused her to be heavily wounded, it effectively widened the distance between herself and Ling Han once more. With her speed, she did not even need half a day to reach the north sea, a place which was beyond the reach of the Great Ling Empire’s power of nation.

Let’s see who gets to kill whom then!

Xiao Miaoyan’s eyes were filled with killing intent. She had never been in this pitiful a state in the Immortal Realm, yet now in the Lower Realm, she actually had to burn her life force in order to flee for her life.

Just when she was fuming, she saw a small silhouette appear before her. After that, a fist came crashing at her.

“Niu’s Flying Tornado Fist!”

Peng!

This fist heavily landed on her face.

Xiao Miaoyan had never expected that a person would suddenly appear in front of her. She was flying in the air, observing the surroundings on all four sides, and there had been no one anywhere in the front, which meant that the perpetrator of this sneak attack could only have closed in from the back!

Hiss, was this a ghost? She was already burning her lifeforce, who could still catch up to her?

A long stream of blood spilled from her nose, and her upper body was thrown backward and turned over. Taking a fist at such high speed, she lost all semblance of control over her body.

“The pain is killing Niu!” Hu Niu hastily shook her hand. Though her fist struck Xiao Miaoyan on the face, in actual fact, it was tantamount to hitting her own fist with an equal force, coupled with Xiao Miaoyan’s high speed; the bones in her hand were all broken, and even the whole arm was hanging limply.

“Damn it!” Xiao Miaoyan slowly recovered her senses. She then stared fixedly at Hu Niu with gushing killing intent.

On this little girl was an extremely great treasure—even the ultimate elites from the Immortal Realm would be tempted.

I’ll kill her, seize the treasure, and refine it myself!

Xiao Miaoyan revealed a cruel expression that was filled with greed—this was really an opportunity delivered to her door.

“You think too much!” At this time, a cold and indifferent voice drifted over from behind her, making every pore on her body tense up, while her forehead was instantly covered with sweat.

She apprehensively turned around, and caught sight of Ling Han brandishing the Revere Life Sword!

“Don’t kill me, I can become your woman!” she screamed out. “With my looks and talent in martial arts, I will definitely be of help to you!” She sneered inwardly—this was of course just a stalling tactic, for she wanted to kill this man at all costs.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han swung his sword, not stopping in the least.

What!?

She was so beautiful, and had such amazing talent in martial arts, yet he actually would strike her?

Xiao Miaoyan gave a loud cry, and her wings spread out behind her. She wanted to try her utmost to leap and dodge this fatal blow.

Pu!

A sword swept past, and a person’s head was sent flying. It still wore a shocked, disbelieving expression, spilling blood which shook the heaven and earth. Pa , the headless body collapsed on the ground, not even twitching—she was directly killed on the spot.

This was the Number One Killing Sword in all lands under the heavens!

Ling Han put away his sword and said, “How is it, let me see if the injury is serious or not!”

“The pain is killing Nu!” Hu Niu pouted, absolutely upset.

As Ling Han took out Spiritual Herbs to treat Hu Niu, with a smile, he remarked, “You are indeed reckless and daring. You even dared to block her; I was scared out of my wits by you just now, don’t be crushed to pieces!”

When a Shattering Void Tier elite desperately on the run, moreover one that was burning her lifeforce and possessed the battle prowess of eighteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier, collided with someone, perhaps even a Shattering Void Tier elite would also be smashed to smithereens, let alone only a Heaven Tier cultivator.

But, Hu Niu was, after all, Hu Niu—she was unparalleled, and could not be measured by general rules.

“Hehe, this wretched woman also wanted to be Ling Han’s woman, Niu does not agree!” Hu Niu used her other hand to grab Ling Han. “Ling Han is Niu’s!” She expressed an intense desire to monopolize him, yet there were traces of anxiety in the depths of her eyes.

Ling Han gave out a hearty laugh. This little girl really did not change all this while. When she was five, she was like that, and at ten, she was also like that. However, the little girl has grown up, and now could be called a young maiden, possessing a slight trace of femininity.

“Niu wants to eat a lot of delicious food to restore Niu’s body!” Hu Niu stretched out her hand to ask Ling Han for food.

He nodded his head. He first searched Xiao Miaoyan’s body, yet could not find her spatial Spirit Tool, which contradicted her identity. Perhaps her descent from the Immortal Realm would destroy the spatial Spirit Tool? Otherwise, one could take along a great number of treasures, and it would not be every person from their team only bringing along a drop of Immortal blood.

Ling Han and Hu Niu entered the Black Tower. He first prepared the food for the little lady, letting her eat and drink to her heart’s content and forget about the pain from her broken arm.

Afterwards, Ling Han grabbed the Asura Demon Emperor.

Within the Black Tower, Ling Han was a god. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The Asura Demon Emperor trembled—he had already been taught a lesson by Small Tower once. Now, he no longer had a temper, and was well-behaved like a grandson.

Though similarly referred to as ‘Emperor’, his aura and the aura of the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire were way too far apart.

“I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you an earth-shattering secret, don’t kill me!” the Asura Demon Emperor hurriedly shouted out right away as soon as he saw Ling Han. Earlier on, Small Tower had already proved that his life was incomparably fragile here.

He could even refine the Chaos Source Rock, what more a wisp of Demonic Qi like him?

Ling Han sat cross-legged with one foot poised in the air. He naturally had no face to give this kind of coward who cared for naught but his own life. If the other party had been unyielding unto death, at least that could garner his respect. In a displeased tone, he said, “Who told you that you could use some secret to avoid having to die?”

“This secret you will definitely be interested in!” the Asura Demon Emperor hastily shouted. “It relates to the entire Lower Realm!”
