Chapter 3494: Battling Bai Hongcai again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was one of the twin prodigies of the Imperial City. His natural talent in cultivation was astonishing, and he was also a Grandmaster of formations. His future prospects were boundless.

However, Ling Han’s cultivation level was also a shortcoming. After all, Ling Han had risen too late. Though he had already caught up with Extreme Bone Tier, in this new era where there were Enlightenment Tiers and Mystery Realm Tiers here and there, the cultivation level of Extreme Bone Tier was really not enough.

This was going to be terrible.

Of course, not everyone was on Ling Han’s side. There were also some who had grudges with Ling Han in the first place, or were jealous of him, and now smirked coldly.

An elite of Enlightenment Tier could use his full strength, so how would he be able to block?

Bai Hongcai strode forwards, and did not make a move at the first instant. He only released his powerful aura as a deterrent. This was deliberately exerting pressure on Ling Han.

He was a whole two major cultivation levels higher than Ling Han, so defeating Ling Han was like child’s play to him. Naturally, there was no need for him to take it seriously. However, he had been sent flying with a punch from Ling Han last time, and his expression was ugly. Now, he naturally had to vent his anger properly, making Ling Han feel even more embarrassed.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back, looking completely at ease.

F***, y0U really know how to put on an act.

Bai Hongcai’s expression darkened. He had initially wanted to exert pressure on Ling Han, but Ling Han, on the other hand, was acting cool.

Damn guy.

He humphed, and finally moved. He shot out a palm strike, and the power of his fist condensed high-level energy, turning into a ball of light the size of a human head, that blasted towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was unafraid. When the ball of light arrived, he casually sent out a palm strike. Pa, the ball of light shattered.

F***, was this real?

Everyone’s eyes widened, as if they had seen a ghost.

They indeed knew that Ling Han was awesome, but who could be awesome enough to battle with a cultivation level that surpassed two major tiers?

Wang Yu, Pei Yunshu, Ceng Ruixuan and the others all exchanged looks, a guess rising up in their hearts. Could it be that it was Ling Han that was the mysterious robber?

Hiss, a monster that had surpassed the cultivation level of two major tiers and was battling fiercely?

Was this a five-star genius or a six-star genius?

Could such a monster really exist in this world?

Bai Hongcai naturally guessed as well, and called out loudly, “Ling Han, were you the one who sneak attacked me a few days ago?

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. He had been exposed just like that? How could that be allowed? He still wanted to continue this business in future.

He ignored him, and released his own aura without reservations.

“Yi, this aura… isn’t Extreme Bone Tier!” Wang Yu immediately said.

“Inscription Tier!” Pei Yunshu said.

“No wonder.” Ceng Ruixuan nodded, “He is a four-star genius, and can be invincible even with a gap of a major tier in cultivation level, so he was able to easily disperse Bai Hongcai’s attack.”

These people all breathed a sigh of relief. Otherwise, it would be too terrifying. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A five-star genius had actually appeared?

“However, this brat is a four-star genius, and now has crossed over into the Inscription Tier. I’m afraid that Bai Hongcai is no match for him,” Pei Yunshu said with a frown. They had come aggressively. If Bai Hongcai was no match for Ling Han, wouldn’t that become a huge joke?

Wang Yu thought for a moment, then said, “The battle has already begun, and it is already too late to call a halt. Furthermore, this brat must have just broken through, and his battle prowess is rusty. Who knows, it is not definite that he can be invincible with a cultivation level that surpasses a major tier.

“Then let’s take a look first,” Xiang Teng said as well.

None of them interfered, wanting to give Bai Hongcai a chance. If they had to send out a Mystery Realm Tier to fight against an Inscription Tier, they would really lose face.

Bai Hongcai was unsure again. Was Ling Han already capable of opposing him in the first place, or was it because he had advanced into Inscription Tier?

He took a deep breath. He had to win. Otherwise, if he lost to Ling Han twice, he would have to avoid Ling Han when he saw him in future.

“Fire Cloud Divine Technique!” he murmured. Boom! Fiery flames instantly entwined around his body, yet they were still around a foot away from his body. It was as if they were a shield.

He gave another loud shout, and charged towards Ling Han.

The flames burned fiercely. It was like a god of fire had possessed him, capable

of incinerating everything.

Ling Han similarly stimulated a high-level energy of Stone, which entwined around his fists, and clashed head-on with his opponent.

He didn’t go all out. With his current battle prowess, he could already completely crush Bai Hongcai, an ordinary Enlightenment Tier cultivator that couldn’t even be considered a one-star genius. However, he wanted to test out his battle prowess, and he also wanted to buy some time, so he didn’t end the battle quickly.

It would be easy to defeat Bai Hongcai, but next, there was still Pei Yunshu, Xiang Teng, and Wang Yu. How was he going to deal with these Mystery Realm Tiers?

Ling Han only had so many trump cards. Perhaps he could match a Mystery Realm Tier elite, but he definitely wouldn’t be able to match two, what more a few of them.

Hence, he was presently using the technique of ‘dragging it out’.

Yet Bai Hongcai did not know himself, and thought that he was not at a disadvantage at all. In fact, if he used his ultimate move again, he would definitely be able to defeat Ling Han.

He couldn’t help but sneer, “Natives are still natives, after all. Too weak!” Inscriptions appeared on his palm. One, two, three, all the way to five, forming a five-pointed star, exuding an indescribable aura.

Inscriptions were bestowed by the heavens. This could be seen as the aura of heaven and earth.

Boom, he controlled this palm strike, and delivered a palm strike at Ling Han. Instantly, its might soared.

Aside from protecting internal organs, the inscribed patterns could also be reflected on fists, feet, or weapons, greatly increasing their might.

Ling Han did not parry, and merely used his movement technique to dodge. “Hahaha, Ling Han, you are too weak, too weak!” Bai Hongcai laughed loudly. He moved again. Xiu, xiu, xiu, the apertures all over his body lit up, shooting out mystical power that was as thin as a spider’s web. However, its might could not be underestimated.

Generally speaking, cultivators’ attack patterns were limited. If they attacked from afar, they would either exert force through their hands, or through their legs. One only had to pay attention to their opponent’s arms and legs.

However, after advancing into the Enlightenment Tier, one would be able to open all the apertures in one’s body. Not only could this speed up the absorption of the power of heaven and earth, one could also fire out mystical power from within. Of course, its might was not as great as being shot out from one’s hands or feet, but it was hard to guard against.

As expected, Bai Hongcai seemed to have turned into a porcupine. Power surged out of the parts of his body that were completely incapable of exerting force, turning into multiple flaming arrows.

Ling Han was still dodging. Previously, when he had battled with an Enlightenment Tier elite, he had basically used Absolute Fairness to weaken the latter’s cultivation level. This naturally could not possibly show the full battle prowess of an Enlightenment Tier elite, so this time, he had to observe carefully.

The more Bai Hongcai fought, the more confident he became. He laughed loudly, and mocked Ling Han endlessly.

Not only did he want to win, he also wanted to humiliate Ling Han harshly. Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. To say nothing of the fact that he hadn’t been serious all this while, even if Bai Hongcai had really won, what was there to be proud of when an Enlightenment Tier elite had defeated an Inscription Tier?

However, what he didn’t know was that Bai Hongcai had already confirmed that he was a four-star genius. Thus, even if he had the advantage of a major tier in cultivation level, he could still boast a bit if he won. In fact, he could even slap Ling Han’s face. Could you even be considered a four-star genius?

After battling for a while longer, Ling Han was really unable to drag things on any longer. His opponent’s attacks were really too unoriginal. It was just a few moves back and forth, which made him feel extremely bored.

He had already dragged on for a very long time, so he was not going to play around anymore.

Ling Han smiled..
