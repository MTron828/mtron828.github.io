Chapter 853: The Ship Came Again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Unless Ma Duo Bao came personally, they wouldn’t be able to rival the king of demon servants, let alone annihilate it.

However, Ma Duo Bao was restrained by the Thousand Corpse Sect. Water from afar quenched not fire—he couldn’t possibly help them.

What were they to do?

Ling Han frowned. He could only store everyone into the Black Tower. They definitely couldn’t all die here. As long as they didn’t die, then everything was possible. Besides, once Ma Duo Bao realized what was going on, he would be able to quickly lend a helping hand.

It could only be so.

“Everyone, I have a spatial divine tool that can save our lives. Don’t resist my divine sense’s envelopment later, I’ll bring everyone inside.” Ling Han sent a divine sense transmission to the eight Kings and Yi Shuang Shuang.

“Spatial divine tool!” Yi Shuang Shuang’s beautiful eyes immediately widened. This thing was extremely precious even in the divine realm—only the top almighties could refine it. She’d never thought Ling Han would possess one.

No wonder she smelled the presence of an amazing treasure on him!

The eight Kings all nodded. The situation developing to this stage was not something they could control anymore, and only Ma Duo Bao could turn the tides for them.

Ling Han had a formidable physique, and was the first to stand up, but he suffered heavy injuries in the battle previously, and was currently riddled with scars, appearing too ghastly to look at.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu leapt over. The little girl was also injured quite terribly, blood dripping from her forehead, giving off a distressingly beautiful look.

Damn it!

Ling Han regretted it on the inside. Previously, although he escaped from the Sea Race, he didn’t take it to mind, since being able to escape unscathed from a True Dragon in the Shattering Void Tier wasn’t something to be ashamed of. But now, he was utterly defeated, and with the invasion of demon servants, countless of living beings would be murdered in cold blood. As a king, how could he possibly feel well?

The power of the nation was a double-edged sword, and now it was biting back.

“Hehe, leave your lives here for This King!” The king of demon servants laughed loudly, and struck with his palm again. Battle prowess surpassing Shattering Void Tier twenty stars shook heaven and earth, even forcibly tearing apart space. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hong!

At this moment, a ship’s bow suddenly rammed out of a spatial fissure.

Sh*t, again?

Previously, Ma Duo Bao had attacked the five sects, and Shattering Void Twenty stars of battle prowess burst forth, tearing apart space immediately, resulting in a divine ship crashing out. It was unknown how long it sailed in the void, but there were still dead souls that hadn’t dispersed, and their strength was nature-defyingly powerful.

Now... Was it going to happen again?

The ship’s bow rammed out, revealing a nine hundred meter ship.

However, this ship was different from the previous one. There obviously wasn’t any breach on it, its flag was distinct, and there were even female soldiers that kept watch at the ship’s bow.

Ling Han could see clearly that a strange being was drawn on the flag—a fish swimming in the sea, suddenly breaking out of the water and turning into a roc, roaming between heaven and earth.

It was clearly only a painting, yet an animated image was produced in his mind—truly mystical.

The ship lay between the king of demon servants and Ling Han, the eight Kings, and the others.

“Who is it, daring to stop This King?” the king of demon servants immediately shouted. His current battle prowess was at the height of twenty stars, which was invincible in this realm, making his confidence blow through the roof.

Ling Han and the eight Kings’ expressions were strange. They’d seen the impressiveness of another divine ship, and the girl on it even lashed away the Eye of Heavenly Dao. You’re asking for trouble.

No one on the ship paid attention to him. An old woman in cyan clothes walked to the bow, and glanced down, her gaze stopping on Hu Niu, instantly revealing a pleasantly surprised look.

Xiu, xiu, xiu , more than ten people immediately leapt off the ship. All were women, but none were dressed as soldiers. They all wore battle suits of generals, appearing to have considerable status.

“It’s an honor to see the Milady 1 !” These girls all bowed down, saluting towards Hu Niu. The old woman in cyan clothing was an exception; she revealed a smile, and said, “Little girl, this old one finally found you.”

“You people...” The king of demon servants was furious. There were people in this world that dared to ignore him? He sneered, and swung his hand at these girls. When they turned into a pool of blood, they would regret their current attitude, right?

“Young Lady, who hurt you?” all the girls asked Hu Niu, every one of them revealing furious expressions.

Although Hu Niu was unclear as to why, she was quite clever and mischievous, immediately pointing at the king of demon servants and those demon servants. She said, “It’s him, him, him, him, him, and him, him, him, him, him, him, and him!”

All the girls stood up and turned around, looking towards the king of demon servants.

This was extremely strange. The king of demon servants already attacked, but with the speed of Shattering Void Tier twenty stars battle prowess, how come the attack hadn’t hit yet? It was as if time was frozen!

A female general attacked and pressed towards the king of demon servants.Hong , heaven and earth began lamenting, and with a pa , the king of demon servants was instantly shocked into pieces, its presence instantly disappearing.

It died just like that.

This was Shattering Void Tier twenty stars of battle prowess, invincible in this realm, so how was it possible to be killed instantly with one move!?

Yi Shuang Shuang lost her calm, and shouted, “This is divine level power!”

“Divine level power again!” Ling Han and the eight Kings’ expressions were very strange. Were they really living in a sealed off small world now that divine level power appeared continuously?

Another large ship, and just as terrifying!

Those demon servants were completely shocked. What was going on... They’d slept soundly for countless millennia to turn their bodies into demons, and they should’ve been invincible in the world when they came out. They even had the important task to bring the vast lands into the underworld, being able to create history, but having just walked out of the desolate north, their boss died.

How could they accept it?

Hong, long, long , As the world shook violently, the Eye of Heavenly Dao appeared. It could be seen clearly that there was a bleeding wound on the eyeball, which actually hadn’t healed after such a long time.

“Milady’s aura!” a female general said.

“It was injured by Milady.”

“However, Milady didn’t annihilate it, then we should also show mercy,” the other female generals said one after another.

The old woman in cyan clothing looked up at the sky, and said indifferently, “Get lost!”

The Eye of Heavenly Dao immediately blinked. You guys think that you’re all that woman, being able to injure me with a lash? It was infuriated, and actuated the might of heaven and earth, attempting to expel these people.

The small world couldn’t allow divine level power!

“I told you to get lost, didn’t you hear?” The old woman in cyan clothing widened her eyes, instantly emitting an infinitely imposing presence. Pa , the Eye of Heavenly Dao’s wound split open, and large amounts of blood gushed out.

F***!

At this instant, everyone started to shout curses.

Too unacceptable, the dignified Eye of Heavenly Dao, the embodiment of heaven and earth’s will, actually couldn’t endure an old woman’s gaze!

What was the Eye of Heavenly Dao?

The Eye of Heavenly Dao shivered, feeling an intense fear. It could feel that the being below possessed the power to destroy it.

A few female generals turned around and attacked the demon servants. Hong, hong, hong, divine level power was used without restraint, instantly wiping out all the demon servants.

Divine level power should be forbidden from appearing in the small world, but they attacked without restrain in front of the Eye of Heavenly Dao. This was the most impressive cheat in the world, right?

Everyone stared agape, feeling that they could boast about the events of today for their entire life.

Seeing this scene, this lifetime was worth it.

The Eye of Heavenly Dao wailed, and left in a flash. You guys go cause a disturbance, I don’t care anymore!
