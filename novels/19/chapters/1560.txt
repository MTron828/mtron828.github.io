1561 Caught up

Ling Han’s eyes suddenly lit up. What he lacked was precisely Saintly medicine.

Mo Li continued to steer the raft forwards, while the others all did their best to recover their vitality. After a few more hours, there would be another barrage by a massive wave. If they could not recover to their prime condition before that, the negative effects would endlessly accumulate, and would definitely result in serious injury.

The other groups did not seem to be any better, especially those groups without such super elites like Mo Li, Zhu Ba, and Yun He on standby; they were all bruised and battered.

A few hours later, the second huge wave came as expected.

Peng!

In the midst of the fierce barrage, a considerable number again coughed blood and experienced broken bones, and the flying raft was also undergoing a serious test. Going by this trend, let alone reaching the mountain peak in the middle of the ocean, it would be a problem for them to even travel one-third of the way there.

“The ship will be destroyed in the end, but before that, we’ll try to get as close as possible,” Mo Li said.

If she was the only one on this journey, she naturally would not need to use whatever flying raft. She only had to physically fly there. However, her main reason for entering here was to take care of these junior sisters and junior brothers of hers. Thus, the flying raft was the best option. It could allow these junior sisters and brothers to get as much time as possible to adjust.

However, though the massive waves this time were frightening, Ling Han was also on board, and if he used his full battle prowess, he was in no way inferior to Mo Li, so it naturally allowed this group of theirs to have a much easier time than the others with the combined effort and help of these two great big shots.

It could be seen that Ling Han’s group of 10 were already in the lead. The other dozen or so groups, meanwhile, were quite a distance behind. Furthermore, they no longer advanced together at the same pace. Those groups that had a big shot on standby were in front, and those without were behind. The poorer their abilities, the farther behind they were.

“Yi, there’s something ahead!” Ling Han’s eyes were focused on the surface of the ocean. He stretched out his hand, and Origin Power formed a huge hand that grabbed out at the ocean’s surface.

“No!” Mo Li hurriedly advised.

But it was too late. Ling Han had already scooped up the ocean’s water, and withdrew the large hand. When he opened his palm, he saw that there was some duckweed in his grasp, and it had born a small silvery chestnut.

“Spiritual Treasure Silver Chestnut!” Mo Li’s eyes lit up, and then she revealed a sliver of shock. “Your hand is actually unwounded!”

Spiritual Treasure Silver Chestnut, a Level 16 Godly medicine, could be used to concoct various kinds of high-grade Divine Pills, and could be considered one of the very best among Saintly medicines. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Han was very pleased, and put the silver chestnut away into the Black Tower. Then, he asked, “Why would my hand be wounded?”

How could she curse him like that?

A disciple answered, “Brother Ling, don’t forget that there are shards of Regulations belonging to a supreme great elite in the ocean’s water. Dipping your hand into the water would be equivalent to colliding with these shards of Regulations. It would easily wound even a big shot. Otherwise, why would we choose not to travel underwater?”

If they travelled underwater, it would perhaps be slightly slower, but they would be able to avoid the massive waves, and it was much safer. But hearing these words from him, it was indeed impossible to travel underwater. That would be equivalent to taking the initiative to confront the huge waves at all times. If they emerged from the experience without severe wounds, that would be the true strange thing.

So that was the case. Ling Han nodded. It looked like his physique was indeed too strong, and even the shards of Regulations could not wound him—this definitely corresponded to cultivation level. The higher the cultivation level, the more impact would be felt. However, his physique had far surpassed his cultivation level, so he was naturally completely unscathed.

The flying raft advanced, and as they continued to venture deeper into this ocean, they could also see a great many Godly medicines on their way. The majority of them ended up in Ling Han’s pocket, but he did not spend the time to harvest some of them, due to the distance factor.

Because they had not seen Tan Mo and his group all this while, it meant that those five people were still ahead of them. If they delayed too much on their journey, that divine bamboo would fall into the hands of others.

That was Saintly medicine, and even 10,000 high-grade Godly medicines could not compare to it.

In truth, Ling Han really did not lack Godly medicines. Previously, when he had been in the Medicine King’s Cave, he had harvested a great many. Otherwise, he could not possibly simply concoct any kind of Eternal River Tier-level Divine Pill as he liked like he could at present.

The massive waves here adhered to their own rhythm. There would be a wave about every 12 hours, which just happened to be half a day’s time. After they had experienced a total of 27 waves, they had completely thrown off the 16 groups behind them from their tail, and they finally spotted Tan Mo’s group in front.

These five people were actually seated on a spread out scroll. It was very big, and was 30 meters long and nine meters wide. It was completely golden, and there were densely packed characters which rose up into multiple demonic patterns written on it. Each demonic pattern seemed capable of suppressing eternity.

Ling Han and his group spotted Tan Mo and their group, and the latter clearly spotted them as well. They all looked disdainful, and two of them even used their hands to form insulting gestures.

“Mo Li, catch up with quickly, we’ll beat these bastards to death!” Wu Jue howled in fury.

Yet Mo Li’s expression was solemn, and she coldly commanded, “Do not make trouble!”

Tan Mo was too strong. He had even surpassed the level of a big shot, and he could be claimed to be a Pseudo-Demon Master—she even suspected that great elites that had just reached Demon Master Tier might be far inferior to Tan Mo in terms of power.

Wu Jue pouted, looking completely like a little bottom.

Tan Mo sat cross-legged in the foremost position. He also turned his eyes their way, and there was some surprise in his gaze, as if he was confused how Ling Han and his group could’ve possibly caught up to them.

It should be known that the scroll that they were astride was not an ordinary object, but a decree that was personally written by a Heaven Demon. The strongest Regulations of heaven and earth of the Netherworld were condensed within. But even so, they still experienced much strain when they were being barraged by the huge waves. The shards of Regulations embedded in these huge waves would be stronger the stronger their foe was, and even the decree of a Heaven Demon could not suppress them.

But with the decree of a Heaven Demon, they definitely had a large advantage over everyone else. They should have left those people behind them farther and farther behind, so how could it be possible that others would catch up with them?

Tan Mo’s expression was like a smile yet not a smile, and a hint of killing intent leaked into his eyes.

This was a very clear warning. Don’t even think of trying to catch up, or he would definitely not be reserved.

Mo Li and the others naturally saw this kind of warning clearly, and they were all furious.

This Mystery Realm belonged to their 17 Demon Masters. You all were only outsiders, and not only did outsiders like you overwhelm your hosts, you actually dared to be so imperious. How preposterous!

Tan Mo withdrew his gaze, and looked ahead.

He was completely indifferent about the reactions of Ling Han and his group. In his eyes, they were all absolute trash. Even if they were defiant, so what? Did they actually dare come close? If they did, he would dare to kill them.

“Too arrogant!” Chi Huangji and the others all grumbled.

Ling Han did not say a word. At present, he did not have a conflict of interest with Tan Mo yet, but once the nine segment divine bamboo was found, if a fight started—and that was practically a confirmed matter—then he would not shrink back, either.

He would deal with him with the Divine Demon Sword.

It could be claimed that even if Hu Feng caught up with him at this time, Ling Han would dare confront him head-on too. Of course, it would only be one or two strikes. More than that, and he would still have to retreat, but he even dared to stand against a Saint, so what worth did you, a pseudo-Demon Master, or semi-Demon Master, have?

The person who laughed last would laugh best.

Boom!

It was at this moment that the 28th huge wave rolled out towards them from afar.

The decree that Tan Mo’s group was aboard immediately exploded in a burst of golden light, as if a Demon Master was about to walk out from within, forcibly slicing a passageway through the massive wave. Yet the huge wave was indeed not to be trifled with, either. Multiple seals lit up in the ocean water and began to attack them.

As the wave swept over them, Tan Mo’s group all paled. Even the speed of progression of the decree had sharply decreased.

At this time, Ling Han and the others also greeted the incoming huge wave.

Boom!
