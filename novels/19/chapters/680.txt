Chapter 681: A Shred of Saber Heart

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

Xiu, xiu, xiu, the arrows shot out rapidly.

During the first battle, Small Saber King could forcibly deflect the arrows, but now, the strength gap of the two almost shrank to the level of zero, so how could Small Saber King block these three Mystical Powers together?

Ling Han’s strength had been much lower than his, and Ling Han hadn’t truly learned the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, already making him feel Ling Han troublesome. Now, Ling Han’s strength increased greatly, finally causing a change in quality of Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Mystical Powers could kill gods!

Ling Han’s tier was still too low, and he couldn’t kill gods at the moment, but killing Small Saber King wouldn’t be difficult.

Two light shields flashed consecutively over Small Saber King’s body and helped him avoid certain death twice. His expression couldn’t help but become bleaker, as the talisman already turned into ash, no longer being able to protect him.

The next arrow would set the time of his death.

This was a death match he’d agreed to, and would only end when one person fell for eternity. No one on the academy’s side objected, so now there couldn’t possibly be anyone that would come out to stop them.

Rules were rules, and if broken recklessly, would there still be any trust among people?

Small Saber King’s gaze was like a saber. At this moment, he wasn’t frightened by the fear of death, but was rather incited with a fighting spirit as he struck at Ling Han with a side slash of the saber.

Hong , the saber light was as if ablaze, emitting an indescribable mighty presence.

“Saber, Saber Heart!” someone from the older generation blurted out.

“Not Saber Heart, but he touched a shred of it!” Someone on the side shook their head, but also gave it positive recognition.

“Being able to comprehend Saber Heart, one would have the right to touch the rules of Great Dao. This is an underrated genius!” a third person from the older generation said.

“We can’t let him die!” a fourth person said decidedly.

Earlier, they let the two fight a fierce life or death battle because although Small Saber King’s reputation was remarkable, they saw it as nothing more, and sacrificing him wouldn’t matter. However, it was not ordinary being able to comprehend the heart of marital arts, and placed in the god realm, there would even be hope of becoming the finest elites.

Pu!

Ling Han quickly drew the bow and shot an arrow. With the light of destruction, it appeared before Small Saber King’s forehead in a flash, penetrating right through. This arrow was too terrifying, for it pierced through Small Saber King’s head fully and shot out of the other end, carrying silver-colored blood and soaring into the sky; its power didn’t seem to be reduced at all.

Xiu, xiu, xiu , there old monsters appeared, all of Heaven Tier cultivation, but they still came one step too late. Small Saber King fell down from the sky, life force leaving his body rapidly.

An old monster carried Small Saber King and left immediately, probably thinking to rescue him.

However, Ling Han could guarantee with his status as the Alchemy Emperor in the previous life that this arrow had already obliterated Small Saber King’s soul, and even if there was some divine pill that could heal Small Saber King’s body, that would only be obtaining a complete body.

With the soul already dead, would Small Saber King still be Small Saber King? Even if a new soul could be birthed again, then it might be mediocre in martial arts, and even possibly talentless.

In short, Small Saber King was utterly dead.

he remaining two old monsters looked coldly at Ling Han, extremely discontented in their hearts, but when both parties decided to battle to the death, they didn’t come forward to stop it, so what could they even say now?

They could blame Small Saber King for being too lowly. Couldn’t he have comprehended Saber Heart a bit earlier? Did it have to be at the most dangerous moment of life or death, which led them to fall short of stopping it?

After all, Ling Han now possessed the battle prowess of high level Deity Transformation Tier, and even Heaven Tier warriors had to be fully concentrated to stop him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Gazing at Ling Han for a while, an old monster finally brushed his sleeve, and said in a displeased tone, “Disperse!”

“Yes!” No one dared to say anything as they walked away with their heads down one after another. There were still many Earth Grade and Black Grade palace halls vacant, so they were obviously going to seize it. Small Saber King died, and that was all—what did that have to do with them?

Small Saber King died, so wasn’t his palace hall vacant? But who would dare have any ideas about this palace hall? Wouldn’t they fear being shot to dregs by Ling Han?

Ling Han looked at the old monster that was going away, feeling extremely irritated inside.

His spoils of war were taken away just like that.

However, no matter how strong he was now, he couldn’t be stronger than a Heaven Tier warrior. Other than watching them go, what else could he do? He snorted inside, and thought, Damned old man, don’t you drop any hairs, or else I’ll curse you to sh*tting for three days and three nights.

He landed, and said, “Let’s go to Small Saber King’s palace hall. There might be some battle trophies left.”

Small Saber King had obtained the treasure trove of an ancient dynasty, and some treasures were too massive, unsuited for storing in a spatial ring, and needed a place to be set.

They rushed over excitedly, and after asking someone, they found the location of Small Saber King’s palace hall and walked in one after another.

“Hmm, turns out this palace hall comes with a Gathering Spirit Formation.”

“No wonder I didn’t clearly feel the Spirit Qi purity increase by ten times.”

“Turns out the key lies with these palace halls.”

Everyone cried out one after another in surprise. Cultivating here, it would truly be half the work and twice the effect. No wonder Small Saber King broke through to the Deity Transformation Tier so quickly. Those disciples that obtained direct entry most probably had come a few months earlier, and being able to cultivate for so long, they’d obviously pulled the gap between others a step further.

But Small Saber King encountered a freak like Ling Han, and could only die with grievance, being too unlucky.

Although this palace hall might seem large, it could provide space for only three to four people cultivating, or else there still wouldn’t be enough Spirit Qi to use. After all, there was a limit to Gathering Spirit Formation’s conversion, and surpassing this limit would be equivalent to losing its effect.

“I counted while walking by earlier. There’re only about five hundred or so palace halls altogether. But, there’s about probably over two thousand people who passed this time.”

According to Restore Heaven Academy’s estimate, a thousand students would be recruited this time, but because Ling Han broke the formation flag in the first stage, leading more people to pass, the amount of people suddenly doubled.

“Too many monks, too little gruel. Now the competition’s going to be fierce.”

“Yeah, anyone would want to live in a palace hall and receive more Spirit Qi. Besides, based on what that person from the academy said, only the talented people living in the palace halls would qualify to receive resources.”

“Then it must be fought for.”

Everyone had great ambitions. Even if they couldn’t contest for a Heaven Grade or Earth Grade palace hall, could they not aim for a Black Grade or Yellow Grade?

Li Feng Yu, Qin Lian Yue, and the others took their leave, all in a rush to seize a good palace hall. Moreover, one could challenge someone to a battle and also avoid a battle, and for geniuses like them, three months’ time was enough for their strength to undergo a drastic change.

Zhu Xuan Er and Hu Niu obviously weren’t leaving. The Spirit Qi inside this palace hall was enough for three people to use, and speaking of cultivation resources, would they lack them with Ling Han, who possessed the Black Tower?

“Ling Han, Niu’s hungry!” Hu Niu acted like a spoiled child.

“Okay, let’s eat first!” Ling Han said with a smile, and took out ingredients to prepare food. He temporarily didn’t think of finding the Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing. The three would developed their own forces and then merge them all, forming a super force.

This academy’s students were divided into four levels, which clearly told them who was the strongest; if you wanted to follow a boss, then find these people.

Not bad, it would be easy to take in underlings.
