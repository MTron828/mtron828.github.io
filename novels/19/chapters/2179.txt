Chapter 2180: Appointment

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this.

Even the Heavenly Saint Celestial King had only caused the Heaven Ringing Stone to ring 83 times. Then just what did the 99 rings from Ling Han signify?

Didn’t this signify that he had the chance to become a paramount Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

At this moment, to say nothing of Ascending Origin Tier elites and Immortal Palace Tier elites, even Celestial Kings gazed at Ling Han with an expression of envy.

Nine Heaven Celestial King! These were the paragons of heaven and earth!

Mo Zhuo pondered for a moment. 90 rings signified that Ling Han had the talent to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Meanwhile, 99 rings signified that he could become one of the most powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Most importantly, the Heavenly Dao had its limits. The ninth heaven was the limit, so 99 rings was also the limit of the Heaven Ringing Stone.

What if Ling Han’s potential was even greater?

In the past, the Heavenly Saint Celestial King had been a follower of the Roc Source Beast. He had a close relationship with the Roc Palace, so he also knew some secrets that other Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings didn’t know.

To his knowledge, there was still a genuinely paramount level above the level of Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Heavenly Venerate!

Heavenly Venerates had transcended above heaven and earth, yet the Heaven Ringing Stone wasn’t transcendent above heaven and earth. Thus, it could only ring a maximum of 99 times. Even if Heavenly Venerates came, they could still only trigger 99 rings from the Heaven Ringing Stone. This was a limit imposed by heaven and earth.

“Young man, what’s your name?” Mo Zhuo asked in a friendly voice. He was naturally posing this question to Ling Han.

Ling Han bowed in respect before saying, “This junior’s name is Han Lin.” He had changed his appearance, so he also changed his name as well.

An emotional expression spread across Mo Zhuo’s face, and he said, “I desire to take you as my disciple. However, my days here are limited, so there’s not much that I can teach you. In any case, since such a prodigy has entered my Heavenly Saint Palace, this must be the will of the heavens.

“Listen to my command. Han Lin can freely enter the Cloud Treasure Hall to comprehend Dao.”

Mo Zhuo’s words were far too astonishing. What did he mean that his days were limited? He was a mighty Eighth Heaven Celestial King, so who could force him to leave the Heavenly Saint Palace?

Moreover, he actually permitted Ling Han to freely enter the Cloud Treasure Hall to comprehend Dao?

One had to realize that all of the Heavenly Saint Palace’s celestial techniques were stored there. In fact, even most Celestial Kings faced restrictions when entering the Cloud Treasure Hall. They were only allowed to comprehend a selected number of the celestial techniques.

Indeed, Ling Han had the potential to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future. However, this was only potential. The road to becoming a Celestial King was a long and challenging one, and just how many people had fallen on this arduous path of growth? After allowing Ling Han to comprehend the secrets of the Heavenly Saint Palace without restriction, what if he were captured by their enemies? Wouldn’t that leak all of the Heavenly Saint Celestial King’s celestial techniques?

Having powerful elites was only one of the reasons that a powerful force could remain prosperous and undying. Possessing unique and powerful celestial techniques was the other important reason.

Even the Palace Leader of the Heavenly Saint Palace was stunned, and he couldn’t help but exclaim, “Venerable Master!”

Mo Zhuo waved his hand, and said, “Great calamity is about to befall heaven and earth… At that time, even the existence of the Heavenly Saint Palace might be challenged. Cultivating good relationships can perhaps give the Heavenly Saint Palace an extra sliver of a chance at survival.”

Upon hearing this, everyone was transfixed with shock. Even Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings were rendered speechless.

Judging by Mo Zhuo’s tone, he was seemingly extremely pessimistic about the future.

Meanwhile, Ling Han came to a sudden realization. By leaving the Heavenly Saint Palace, Mo Zhuo was most likely heading off to resist the storm of darkness. This was also why there were always few Celestial Kings in the Celestial Realm. They would eventually all go to the border of the two realms to resist the storm of darkness.

Mo Zhuo had clearly witnessed the power of the force of darkness before, and it was because of this that he held such pessimism. Perhaps the next arrival of the storm of darkness would spell the end of the Celestial Realm.

In the face of such great calamity, only Heavenly Venerates could ensure their survival. Thus, if Ling Han became a Heavenly Venerate, and if he lent a helping hand to the Heavenly Saint Palace, the Heavenly Saint Palace would then have a chance of survival.

However, becoming a Heavenly Venerate was far too difficult. It was almost an impossible task. This was why Mo Zhuo said there was only a sliver of a chance.

Ling Han bowed in respect again. This Celestial King possessed great wisdom. Just his resolve and magnanimity alone were deserving of his respect.

Mo Zhuo smiled faintly. He knew that Ling Han understood his intentions. With a tap of his feet, an eight-colored celestial light shone around him. When everyone came to their senses, he had already disappeared.

The palace leader of the Heavenly Saint Palace pondered for a moment before saying, “I hereby appoint Han Lin as the Heavenly Will Elder. His status is only beneath mine, and he has the power to check all elders.”

Upon hearing this, everyone was stunned once again.

A measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator could actually enjoy a status superior to the Celestial Kings? Who could accept this?

However, Ling Han developed deep respect and admiration for this palace leader. Since Mo Zhuo had already bestowed him with such great power, this palace leader decided to further push him along. In reality, trying to check and control all elders…? The elders had to be willing to listen to him first.

How could a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator keep them in check?

Thus, this position was in name only. It was simply a nice-sounding title.

The Celestial Kings were naturally all extremely smart people, so they immediately understood the meaning behind all of this. As such, they didn’t speak out in protest. After all, it was Mo Zhuo who had decided to bestow Ling Han with such great power. Who dared to disrespect an Eighth Heaven Celestial King?

With everything said and done, there was naturally no reason for them to remain. They all left the hall.

However, Duan Haiming had nowhere to go, so he could only look toward Ling Han pitifully. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In terms of strength, Ling Han could defeat him in a single strike. In terms of status, Ling Han had more so become the Heavenly Will Elder, the leader of all elders. But what was he?

However, Ling Han simply patted his shoulder, and said, “I won’t stay in the Heavenly Saint Palace forever, so I still need you to look after Ling Jianxue.”

Duan Haiming immediately nodded, and said, “Yes, I understand!” A relieved smile spread across his face.

By saying this, it was clear that Ling Han didn’t intend to punish him for his actions. Thus, he was naturally as delighted as could be. In any case, if he could become acquainted with the Heavenly Will Elder, what did it matter even if he became a slave or a servant?

This was someone who could become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future! This was someone whom even the Heavenly Saint Celestial King wanted to cultivate a good relationship with!

He naturally understood that Ling Han was only forgiving him because he wanted him to look after Ling Jianxue. As such, he would naturally complete this task to the best of his ability.

Ling Han then turned to Ye Jiande, and there was a menacing glint in his eyes.

Ye Jiande humphed upon seeing this. Even though the palace leader and the Heavenly Saint Celestial King both viewed Ling Han in high regard, he was still only a Dividing Soul Tier cultivator, after all. He was heaven knew how far away from becoming a genuine Celestial King. As such, did he dare to target him?

Of course, he didn’t dare continue to target Ling Han, either. After all, his status as the Heavenly Will Elder was truly quite frightening.

“Let’s go!” He waved his hand and left with his two subordinates. He would find another chance to target Ling Jianxue in the future.

Ling Han didn’t stop him. He would help his son, but he definitely wouldn’t do everything for his son.

Without facing challenges and obstacles, how could he develop strength and tenacity?

Right now, the most pressing matter was to increase the strength of his son. After all, he couldn’t step forward to help every single time, could he?

With him, the Heavenly Will Elder, standing guard, Wenren Yue naturally passed the examination with no problem at all. Of course, this wasn’t because Ling Han had opened a back door. Instead, this woman was truly talented enough to become a true disciple. Even Ling Han was slightly surprised by this.

After completing the examination, Ling Han directly dragged Ling Jianxue into the Black Tower, where he would subject him to special training.

No matter what, his son definitely had to become a Fifth Severance monarch tier.

After learning about the dangers of trying to reach the Fifth Severance, Helian Xunxue tried to convince her husband and son to change their minds. If Ling Jianxue failed to reach the Fifth Severance, his only fate would be death. Thus, she preferred her son to be mediocre, especially if that meant he could live on peacefully.

However, Ling Jianxue was extremely resolute. With such a powerful father, even if he couldn’t stand shoulder to shoulder with him, he still had to follow in his footsteps. He couldn’t fall behind too much.

He started to cultivate toward the Fifth Severance.
