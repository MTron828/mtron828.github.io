Chapter 902: A Beauty That is Already Taken

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the classroom, a series of thumping heartbeats was heard, fast like the beats of a drum.

Even Ling Han felt slightly dazed and a little out of control, what more the others.

This woman walked into the classroom, yet did not find a place to sit down. Instead, she stood on the platform, and opened her mouth to say, “I am Shui Yanyu, and from today on, I am your lecturer.”

“Wah!” A round of cheers rose up in the classroom, and everyone was excited.

This extremely beautiful woman was actually their teacher. She was already extremely attractive in the first place, but the forbidden identity of her as their teacher would make their hearts flutter even further.

“Yi, it’s actually Shui Yanyu!”

“She entered into the Northern Institution about 20 years ago, right? At the time, she and Zhou Menghuai were collectively called the Twin Pearls of the Empire, and their fame was even greater than that of the present Three Beauties of the Imperial Capital.”

“I really can’t imagine... Only 20 years passed, and she already advanced into the Mountain River Tier.”

The level of the Shattering Void Tier was too low, and no elite would deliberately focus on studying it. Thus, the class commonly would be taken over by a student that had just advanced into the Mountain River Tier as they had experience they could share with their juniors.

Of course, the person that could hold the position of a lecturer had to have obtained an extraordinary result in the Shattering Void Tier, and would at least have battle prowess worth nineteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier.

“I heard that Senior Brother Zhao is currently pursuing Senior Sister Shui.”

“Which Senior Brother Zhao?”

“Zhao Lun, Senior Brother Zhao, of course!”

“Hiss, a top genius from 500 years ago who reached battle prowess of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier at the age of 26, broke through to the Mountain River Tier at 30, advanced into the middle levels at 90, and into the higher levels at 380 years old—Zhao Lun, that Senior Brother Zhao?”

“Aside from him, who else would qualify to be addressed as Senior Brother Zhao in the whole Northern Institution?”

“Ai, then we can only admire Senior Sister Shui from afar as she will be none of our business.”

“Don’t admire her too much, either. I heard that Senior Brother Zhao is incredibly intimate with Senior Sister Shui, and would be displeased even if someone just looked too long at her. I advise everyone not to talk to Senior Sister Shui as much as possible, or else... hehe!”

Everyone sighed in despair. They had so fortunately been assigned a teacher beautiful enough to ensnare and enrapture the senses, yet were unable to court her at all. They had to be careful even when talking to her so as to avoid attracting Zhao Lun’s attention, or they would definitely be done for!

Zhao Lun had another identity, and that was the only son of the great General Zhao!

One of the Seven Generals, General Zhao was an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier.

He himself was extremely powerful, and his background was also extremely strong as well, so who would dare try to compete with him over a woman?

“Big Sister Shui is so beautiful!” Li Weiwei’s hands were clasped tightly, and her eyes had practically become stars.

Yet Ji Yun’er sighed lightly in her heart. She was was a bit like Shui Yanyu as she, too, had no power over her own marriage. Hence, it was nothing good to be beautiful and possess high talent... unless she was monstrous enough to reach the level of the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. Only then would she be able to take control of her own destiny.

“I have cultivated to the battle prowess of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, so I can still give you some guidance,” Shui Yanyu said. Her voice was sweet, and hearing her speak would make one feel great enjoyment.

“First, let’s talk about why we should aim for twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier?”

A student raised his head, and said, “I know!” Though he knew that the beauty was already taken, he still wanted to make a good impression on this exquisite beauty. “The higher the battle prowess in the Shattering Void Tier, then the stronger your battle prowess would be in the Immortal level.”

Shui Yanyu nodded, and said, “That’s right. The living beings in the Immortal level really have too long of a lifespan. For example, once you step into the Mountain River Tier, you would have a lifespan of 100,000 years. Advancing every minor level would add on another 100,000 years. However, precisely because of that, advancement through the cultivation levels would be increasingly slower and slower, so it would be considered not too bad even if you could only break through once every few millennia.

“As a result, we would spent a hundred years at most in the Shattering Void Tier to aim for the highest battle prowess, yet could benefit in the next 100,000 years or even next ten million years.

“Hence, I advise everyone to definitely be patient. Even if you do not rush up to battle prowess of twenty Stars, you should at least reach eighteen Stars.”

Ling Han nodded internally. However, he was slightly confused as well. Even Wu Gaoyuan, Xiao Miaoyan, and the others had reached battle prowess of eighteen Stars, so how could Yi Shuang Shuang only have battle prowess of fifteen Stars?

In her strongest condition, she was an elite of the Sun Moon Tier. Then, it was obvious that the force behind her had to surpass the five sects in power.

But, even the five sects could nurture an heir with eighteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier, so why was she so inferior?

In a small world, battle prowess reaching fifteen Stars was indeed extremely amazing, but in the Immortal Realm... Most likely everyone in this classroom had that kind of battle prowess, so it was not uncommon at all.

He would ask her when he saw her again.

Shui Yanyu paused for a moment, then said, “Now, I will share some insight with you about aiming for the extreme limit of battle prowess.”

Indeed, she hid nothing, and explained clearly about her experiences on how she had rushed up to twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, but as everyone listened, they gaped in amazement. They really could not tell just from looking that this extremely alluring beauty would actually work so hard. According to how she had done things, it was very possible that she could have died.

Ling Han suddenly opened his mouth, and asked, “Excuse me, Teacher Shui. How can we develop our pure strength to twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier?

The classroom was completely silent before tumultuous laughter broke out.

“I’m about to laugh myself to death. What kind of foolish nonsense is that? How could it be possible that strength could reach twenty Stars!”

“Haha, if one’s strength could reach twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, then how many Stars could his battle prowess reach?”

“25 Stars? 30 Stars?”

“Don’t think nonsense; that is not possible!”

“He’s really proving himself to have come from a small world, actually asking such a boorish question.”

Yet Shui Yanyu waved her hand, and answered solemnly, “According to the research of former sages, after we have cultivated our Origin Power to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, we would only have four Stars’ worth of space for improvement at most. The physical body is the same; there is similarly only four Stars left to improve.”

It was different when a beautiful woman was talking, and everyone immediately silenced.

“But going by that calculation, the extreme limit of strength would be 17 Stars, and there is still a slight gap from 20 Stars.”

Shui Yanyu’s eyes swept over the class, and she said, “Let me tell all of you, strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier does indeed exist!”

“What!?” they all exclaimed in shock. This was too inconceivable, and had completely shattered their perceptions.

“Years ago, Xu Ran, Senior Xu, reached strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier when none before had done so, and none afterward did, either!” Shui Yanyu’s beautiful eyes were bright, and her gaze revealed powerful admiration.

If Xu Ran suddenly appeared, it might be that he would not need more than a few words to win the heart of this beautiful woman. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Then how would we make up for these three Stars of strength?” someone questioned.

Shui Yanyu shook her head, then answered, “This is humanly impossible as one would need the aid of the heavens. For example, you could accomplish some amazing feat and obtain the approval of the heavens and earth.”

A thought flashed in Li Weiwei’s mind, and she asked, “Big Sister Shui, if one has come by splitting open the sky of a small world, would they get the aid of the heavens?”

Shui Yanyu thought for a moment, then replied, “There has never been a small world that has appeared in the Joint Peace Planet by splitting open the sky, so I am unsure. However, if one can split open the sky, this is indeed an amazing, great feat, so it would not be impossible for him to be rewarded richly by the heavens and earth.”

Li Weiwei nodded. The Great Ling Empire had come by opening their sky, and this was no secret among the higher-ups of the nation. However, the Great Ling Empire was really too weak, so which great figure would take it to heart?

Thus, among the younger generation, she was the only one aware that Ling Han was an emperor that had come by opening the sky!

Hiss, this guy had been capable of opening the sky, so his battle prowess was bound to have reached 20 Stars, and with the additional reward from the heavens and earth, how powerful could his present battle prowess be?

Li Weiwei’s eyes instantly widened.
