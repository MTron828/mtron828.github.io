Chapter 858: Terribly Scared

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Other people didn’t recognize him, but would Liu Family’s ancestor not know Feng Po Yun, who was an extremely rare Shattering Void Tier loose cultivator?

There were quite a few legends regarding him. Feng Po Yun also cultivated Sword Heart, having the reputation of being invincible in the same tier! Not to mention a Liu Family’s ancestor who had just advanced into Shattering Void Tier, he acknowledged that he wouldn’t be Feng Po Yun’s match even at the fifth layer Shattering Void Tier.

Moreover... how many Shattering Void Tier elites did the other party have in total?

One, two, three, four!

Three people, and one giant stone puppet.

Did you guys eat a dragon’s guts? Wasn’t this just delivering a pretext to exterminate the Liu Family?

Pa, pa, pa, Liu Family’s ancestor gave these youngsters a sound thrashing, making them feel completely baffled. After beating them until they were covered with bruises, Liu Family’s ancestor stopped, and said, “Don’t heal your injuries, and follow this old man to go give an apology!”

“What?” The youngsters finally knew that the ancestor gave them a sound thrashing because of Ling Han and the others, making them puzzled.

It was not like they weren’t rampant normally—they were even more exaggerated, doing things even more domineering countless times, but their family wouldn’t even say a word of rebuke then, right? Yet now, they not only took a fierce beating, but were also going to apologize?

W-w-w-w-who were these people!?

If they were kickass, then why did they back off? Well, obviously in fear of the Liu Family, no?

“Ancestor, why?” someone asked. He was Liu Family’s favorite descendant, and only he dared to ask at this time.

The others all held their breath and concentrated, wanting to know the answer, or else they’d feel wronged.

“Do you guys think that this old man breaking through to the Shattering Void Tier means that he’s invincible in the world?” Liu Family’s ancestor snorted, and said, “Amongst the people that you guys ‘bullied’ earlier, there were four Shattering Void Tier elites, and at least one of them only needs one move to defeat this old man!”

Pu!

The youngsters instantly spurted out—how was it possible?! In their eyes, their ancestor was invincible—even if he fell short a little, he would still be undefeated.

The Shattering Void Tier stood at the peak of the world, and absolutely didn’t need to fear anyone.

Liu Family’s ancestor sighed inwardly. If he were free of attachments and constraints, then he indeed wouldn’t need to fear anyone. Was it not easy to run for Shattering Void Tier elites if they wanted? But now, he had a family, businesses, and descendants, but Feng Po Yun was completely alone, so how could he not lower his head?

He didn’t move, waiting till Ling Han and the others sat down. He’d immediately take the juniors to go apologize.

Liu Family’s people all watched, and revealed a shocked look because the position of Ling Han and the others was far above theirs, at the highest place of the sky-splitting platform, where the entire scene could be seen.

This...!

The seats couldn’t be chosen recklessly. There was consideration for where each force sat, a type of recognition from the Purple Moon Emperor’s Court. And, in the world, who dared to have objections against Purple Moon Emperor’s Court? Would you dare protest against an elite with Shattering Void Tier twenty stars of battle prowess?

Below Ling Han, a whole area was vacant. It was a kind of stance of Purple Moon Emperor’s Court that no force could sit as equals with the Great Ling Empire, being not even one notch lower, but instead several levels lower.

Seeing this scene, not to mention Liu Family’s youngsters who were unconvinced, even Liu Family’s ancestor was somewhat displeased on the inside.

He admitted that he wasn’t Feng Po Yun’s match, but everyone was in the Shattering Void Tier; he was only slightly inferior, but still in the same level. Now that the two of them not only did not sit as equals, but were also several levels apart, wasn’t this underestimating him too much?

Not only him, the other people also noticed.

Even though the middle state only had a few Shattering Void Tier elites—other than the five sects, it was the Spirit Treasures Pavilion, Alchemist Society, Cold Spear Association, and a few other forces that possessed elites at this level—they still had them, after all.

Now that they were several heads shorter than Ling Han, looking up at him as if his subjects, it made them all feel out of sorts.

Liu Family’s ancestor instantly gave up on the original idea, and said inwardly,Hehe, a tall tree catches the wind. With many elites intervening, this old man can instead wait and see. If they’re beaten down, then they’d have no face to give us trouble.

All the forces that had Shattering Void Tier elites were unconvinced.

For what reasons could you guys sit high up?

Feng Po Yun indeed was very strong, but not strong to that degree!

A Shattering Void Tier elite walked to the high end, and said scornfully, “Hehehe, below some seats is a volcano, not everyone has the qualification to sit there, or else once the volcano erupts, one would be burned to ashes!”

He was a veteran Shattering Void Tier who’d been well known for at least five to six hundred years, and was now at the eighth layer of the Shattering Void Tier. Still, he was too old, his Qi and blood deteriorating, and his battle prowess actually didn’t reach eight stars.

However, from qualification alone, he really was incredible, a real veteran.

So, he was the first one to refuse to accept it. I have high prestige and a glorious name, yet I have to sit below you guys... Do you guys have such qualifications?

The elite’s surname was Man, first name Jingyi. He was over a thousand years old now, with less than ten years of life left, so he had much less scruples in his conduct, taking a stance of mutual destruction no matter how strong an opponent he encountered.

The older he got, the more he cared about an undeserved reputation. A saying said that men lived by honor as trees stood to live—wasn’t it like that? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “No problem, I can handle it!”

“You sure?” Man Jingyi raised his white brows.

“Hehe, Elder Man’s about to get serious!”

“Although the old fellow’s Qi and blood are deteriorating, his tier is as it stands at the eighth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, after all. The people with tier higher than his in the world can be counted on one’s fingers!”

“Burning Qi and blood to fight at the extreme, Elder Man can still unleash battle prowess of eight stars, the strongest battle prowess in the world.”

Everyone nodded. Don’t assume that battle prowess above Shattering Void Tier nine stars was easy to achieve—it was too hard to battle surpassing tiers at Shattering Void Tier. That was why people said that one star was a world’s difference. Those as powerful as the Sword King could only battle while surpassing three to four stars.

Was the world filled with such geniuses?

“Certainly!” Ling Han said with a smile.

Man Jingyi raised his hand, and said, “Then how about you take this old man’s move?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Sure, please go ahead.”

In the sky, the seven Kings watched.

“Should we help?” Justice Mountain King said.

Heavenly Astral King shook his head, and said, “Being able to gain His Majesty’s recognition, even if his strength can’t be compared to ours, means he’s not one to be defeated by such trash. Moreover, his physique is the same as His Majesty’s; so what if that old trash bombarded him?”

“Touche!” The six other Kings all nodded, and gave up on the idea of intervening.

Man Jingyi was somewhat surprised. This youngster was truly a young one that knew no fear, thinking that he was invincible just because he advanced into the Shattering Void Tier. Hmph, today, he’d have him know that the older, the wiser!

He leapt into the sky, and said, “Then let’s fight!” No matter how arrogant he was, he wouldn’t dare to destroy the sky-splitting platform. Not to mention Ma Duo Bao, any of the seven Kings could take care of him.

The old man loved face, and obviously wouldn’t want to be defeated publicly.
