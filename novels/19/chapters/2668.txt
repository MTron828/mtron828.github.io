2669 Suffering consequences of his own actions

For other Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings, this was fatal.

The reason why Celestial Kings were so strong was because they stood at the level of Regulations, and could directly draw and use Regulations, issuing punishment on behalf of the heaven and earth.

Why was there a saying that the Celestial King Tier was divided into nine levels, with each level bringing one closer to ascending the heavens, then?

It was also because of Regulations.

It was just like what Qin Shuang was doing now as he directly dispersed the Regulations in the surroundings. With his higher cultivation level, he naturally could draw on Regulations of heaven and earth from a wider range, but Ling Han could not.

A Celestial King whose Regulations had been stripped from him… How much stronger would he be compared to a Severing Mundane Tier?

“Hahahaha!” Qin Shuang laughed maniacally, brandishing his saw blade as he approached. No matter how strong Ling Han’s secret technique was, it was useless. As long as there were no Regulations Ling Han could draw on, he was just a dead bug.

Qin Shuang could take his life with a single strike!

Ling Han was unmoved. Waving the Divine Demon Sword, he went forth to greet Qin Shuang.

Boom!

The two Celestial Tools clashed, instantly inciting a powerful shock wave, and Qin Shuang’s figure swayed and quivered before being sent flying.

He paled in shock, and was filled with complete confusion. He had actually fallen into a disadvantage in terms of power?

How could this be!

It should be known that Ling Han had not been able to match Qin Shuang at all in the previous exchanges. The gap between them was not just a little bit. Why, then, was it that when things had turned this way, it was Qin Shuang that had become outmatched instead?

Ling Han’s strength had suddenly spiked?

That was not it, Qin Shuang immediately thought. With his insight, he naturally could assess immediately that Ling Han’s power had not increased at all. Instead, there was even a slight decline. The one who had changed was Qin Shuang himself.

His power had fallen too greatly.

That was very normal. Though Qin Shuang could still extract Regulations, they were still coming from a farther area, after all. Originally, there was nothing wrong with this. Even if Qin Shuang could only extract just 10% of the power of Regulation, faced with Ling Han who could draw none, he would enjoy a completely one-sided, crushing advantage.

The problem here now was that Ling Han’s power had completely not declined because he was not able to extract Regulations, but Qin Shuang, on the other hand, was experiencing a great loss of strength due to being able to draw on only a smaller amount of Regulations. With this comparison, he was actually no match for Ling Han in terms of power.

‘This…!’

Once he figured this out, Qin Shuang felt both shock and regret.

He was shocked. Ling Han had to have also cultivated Body Arts, and that was why he could still be so powerful when he could not draw and use Regulations. But this brat’s Body Art was too domineering; it could actually stand at the same level as Regulations, or was even slightly stronger than that.

What Qin Shuang regretted was that he had destroyed the space in their surroundings himself, damaging the Regulations in their vicinity.

Pushing himself into a muddy swamp, wasn’t he an idiot?

“Thanks!” Ling Han quipped, adding fuel to the fire.

Qin Shuang’s face flushed red involuntarily. This was really too ironic. Previously, he had been acting all high and mighty, looking like he was confident and that everything was under his control, and thinking that he would be able to kill Ling Han with just a single strike, yet the result was completely the opposite. To say nothing of killing Ling Han, he himself had suffered a minor loss.

Qin Shuang roared in fury, pointing the saw blade in his hand at Ling Han. “You little brat, you actually dare mock me. How dare you!!”

“What is it? You have come to kill me, and I still have to treat you with respect? Am I a fool, or are you the one who is asking for punishment?” Ling Han’s tongue was merciless. This had come from time spent with the large black dog. His skill at insulting was definitely not inferior to his battle prowess.

Qin Shuang was so infuriated that his gray hair fluttered windlessly. He did not waste any more words with Ling Han, and delivered another strike with his saw blade.

Ling Han was unafraid. Not only did he brandish the Divine Demon Sword to meet this oncoming strike, his left hand clenched into a fist, launching a mad barrage of punches at Qin Shuang

At that moment, Ling Han was in an absolutely aggressive stage, and was completely capable of beating down on Qin Shuang.

Qin Shuang was feeling extremely gloomy. His strength was far superior to Ling Han’s, but because he had not expected that Ling Han had actually cultivated a frightening Body Art as well, the result was his starting on the wrong foot that had led to him losing the whole game. At present, he could only be thrashed helplessly.

Very quickly, Qin Shuang was beaten beyond recognition. However, he was a peak-stage Ninth Heaven monarch star, after all, and also had control of this great formation. He was presently refreshing the space in this area.

Once the space changed, Regulations would naturally return to their original state. By then, Qin Shuang would still be the high and mighty overlord of the Ninth Heaven, while Ling Han would also be beaten back to his original state.

With the help of a Celestial Tool, Qin Shuang could just barely hold up. After paying the price of having three punches from Ling Han land on him, he finally extracted the Regulations from a different space and switched them out. Immediately, calm was reinstated into the chaos of Regulations.

“Brat, you will pay for this!” Qin Shuang roared furiously. He had sustained three punches from Ling Han, and even with his strength, one of his ribs, hip bones, and shoulder bones had been broken. He was unable to heal himself even after a long period of time. However, now that Regulations were reinstated, his injuries immediately healed, and a vicious light shone from his eyes. “You have angered me completely!”

Previously, he had been repeatedly calling himself “old man,” and now that he was extraordinarily infuriated, he naturally could no longer be bothered.

He only had one thought in mind. Take Ling Han down, torture him to his heart’s content, and then finally kill him.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “A minor character that stays in the shadows, only versed in sneak attacks and ambushes. If this was a battle of equal cultivation levels, I would be able to kill you with a single finger! As for now, I will need to exert a little bit more effort.”

Qin Shuang suppressed his fury, approaching as he brandished his saber in his right hand, while his left hand grabbed on a streak of great dao, which turned into a divine staff smashing down on Ling Han.

This was a display of his real battle prowess.

Ling Han smiled faintly. His present battle prowess had also advanced to the Ninth Heaven. Even if he could not match a peak-stage Ninth Heaven monarch star, they were both at the same cultivation level. Any further than that, it would be Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Then, so what if he was a slight bit weaker if they were both at the same level? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two great elites clashed. Ling Han did not shrink back in the slightest. Every strike was a clash of strength with Qin Shuang.

In terms of battle prowess, Ling Han was indeed outmatched. Furthermore, he was at a greater disadvantage. However, in terms of physique, Ling Han was overwhelmingly tough. The only one in the Celestial King Tier that could surpass him in this area was Heavenborn. The large black dog was another; after all, he, too, had cultivated Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Hence, while it was true that his battle prowess was outclassed, Ling Han practically did not suffer any damage. Qin Shuang only wielded a saw blade, and he wanted to wound Ling Han with his own battle prowess?

It would be difficult.

In fact, in the state Ling Han was in while channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he was completely capable of taking a Celestial Tool head-on. However, as long as he was not a Heavenly Venerate yet, he could only channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll for only around two hours.

10 strikes, 100, 1,000; Ling Han was extremely tenacious.

“I have to admit that you are the strongest Seventh Heaven I have ever seen.” Qin Shuang suddenly stopped his attacks, seeming to admire Ling Han very much.

Yet Ling Han shook his head. “Among the Ninth Heavens I have met before, you yourself cannot be ranked in the top 10.”

For example, the large black dog, Du Shiyi, A’mu, the Imperial Void Celestial King, and so on—any one of them was stronger than Qin Shuang.

Qin Shuang’s mouth involuntarily twitched. He was passing judgment like this because he was on a superior level, and was looking down on Ling Han from a lofty position, but now that Ling Han spoke, Qin Shuang was directly demeaned and sent to rock bottom, so how was he able to continue maintain his noble, lofty attitude?

This brat’s tongue… was even more frightening than his battle prowess.

“Bad-mouthed brat, you have truly angered me!” Qin Shuang’s whole body was trembling as a golden light exuded from his eyes. It was like tears, cascading down endlessly. Not only that, his hair also turned from gray to golden, and his skin became taut from its previous loosened state, turning golden as well. His stooped, aged figure reverted to an erect posture.

The present him seemed to have transformed from an old man in his sixties to seventies into a young man all of a sudden.

Ling Han’s eyes flashed coldly. “You’re finally going to bring out your full strength now?”

When one had reached the Celestial King Tier, which of them did not have an unlimited lifespan, and no longer had to fear the Immortal’s Tribulation? So, how could a Celestial King possibly look like Qin Shuang? Thus, it was either that there was something mentally wrong with him, and he deliberately disguised himself this way, or that he was cultivating some kind of strange cultivation technique, and this was the result of such cultivation.
