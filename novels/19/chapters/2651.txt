2652 Hidden Mastermind

Xiao Yingxiong also stopped in his tracks. This was completely different from the rumors. That being the case, it was very likely that there was no ultimate inheritance, nor was there any passageway to leave the Celestial King Graveyard. Instead, this was more like the ultimate resting place for Celestial Kings.

More frighteningly, just how many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were in this place? If they attacked in unison, even First Tier Heavenly Venerates would have to step aside in retreat. Thus, how were they all captured?

By the looks of them, they clearly hadn’t been wounded. That being the case, who possessed such astounding might? Not only had they captured so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, but they had even done so with ease, not needing to injure these Celestial Kings at all.

Even First Tier Heavenly Venerates couldn’t do this, right?

Ling Han had no spare time to chase Xiao Yingxiong. Instead, he gripped his sword and focused his mind to the extreme, ready to face any sudden change.

Xiao Yingxiong’s reaction was identical. If they continued to battle, they would be nothing more than utter fools.

“Sigh!” A long sigh echoed through the large hall, making it impossible to determine where it had come from.

“Why be so pretentious? Show yourself!” Ling Han roared.

“Heh, I’m not being pretentious,” the voice said. A person in black immediately walked out from behind a pillar. Their entire body was hidden by a black cloak, one that even the divine senses of Celestial Kings couldn’t see through.

“Desolate Moon!” Ling Han said in a solemn voice. Only a single person would dress like this.

The person in black chuckled, saying, “Indeed, I am Desolate Moon.” His voice was flowy, and it was hard to determine whether they were male or female.

Xiao Yingxiong pointed at the giant eggs, and asked, “What’s going on here?”

“Oh? Why should I tell you?” Desolate Moon replied calmly.

“It looks like everything is under your control, so why don’t you share this information with us? If there’s no one to share the joy of victory with, won’t that greatly reduce your sense of achievement?” Ling Han said with a smile. “With your own abilities, you were able to trick all of the Celestial Kings in the Celestial King Graveyard. This is a huge achievement, no?”

“Hahaha!” Desolate Moon laughed heartily, saying, “That’s right, I do indeed feel very smug. However, I’ve always been a cautious person. What if you two manage to escape after learning my secret? Won’t that ruin my grand plans?”

This person was truly careful.

“Then I’ll force you to speak!” Xiao Yingxiong roared as he charged forward.

Swoosh!

His spear thrust forth.

Desolate Moon didn’t dodge, nor did he show any signs of blocking this strike. However, just as Xiao Yingxiong’s attack was about to strike him, the spear suddenly stopped, unable to advance another inch.

An expression of struggle spread across Xiao Yingxiong’s face. In fact, sweat started to drip down his forehead. However, his spear was still unable to advance.

Ling Han felt deep apprehension in his heart. Desolate Moon’s abilities were far too terrifying. Without lifting a single finger, he defeated Xiao Yingxiong, a supreme monarch star with a battle prowess at the late stage of the Ninth Heaven. Was he perhaps a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

Desolate Moon extended a hand. He wasn’t quick, and it was as if he were casually raising his hands. He then grabbed the spear and pushed it back slowly, causing the blade of the spear to immediately point away.

“How strange. Why are you completely defenseless before me?” He looked at Xiao Yingxiong before continuing, “The reason for this is very simple. That’s because something within you is being controlled by me. The more powerful you are because of this matter, the more you’ll be controlled by me.”

A thought suddenly occurred to Ling Han, and he exclaimed, “That black energy!”

He finally understood how so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had been captured by Desolate Moon without suffering any wounds. This was because they all had black energy within them. And as long as they had black energy within them, they would be controlled by Desolate Moon!

However, controlling them was one matter. Why did he need to place so many Celestial Kings in such a strange manner?

What in the world was he trying to do?

“Indeed. You’re very smart. However… it’s already too late!” Desolate Moon raised his arm at Ling Han as if he wanted to control him as well. However, he immediately faltered. If he weren’t wearing the cloak, perhaps the astonishment on his face would be evident.

‘F*ck! Why can’t he be controlled?’

In his eyes, all of the Celestial Kings were his pawns. What did it matter that they were powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? Unable to contain their cardinal sin of greed, they were destined to fall under his control. Now, however, someone had actually managed to escape his control? He was naturally astounded.

“You’re… actually unaffected?” Desolate Moon said coldly. He had already regained his composure. What did it matter that Ling Han couldn’t be controlled? He was only a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Not everything can always be under your control, right?”

“Hmph! You think you still have the chance to escape after entering this place?” Desolate Moon swept his hand over Xiao Yingxiong’s head before roaring with laughter, and saying, “Who would’ve thought that this brat detested you so much?

“Very well! I’ll give you the opportunity to exact revenge!” He tapped a finger on Xiao Yingxiong’s forehead, causing countless dazzling particles to instantly funnel into his body.

Ling Han raised a brow. “The complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll?” He had practiced three scrolls, so he was extremely sensitive to this.

“Correct!” Desolate Moon said with pride.

“Sure enough, everything was planned by you all along. However, I still don’t understand. What’s the point?” Ling Han said.

“If you allow this black energy to enter your body, I can satisfy your curiosity,” Desolate Moon replied as he raised his right hand.

Boom!

A wisp of black energy immediately materialized in the air, swirling around his hand.

“This can bestow you with a boundless battle prowess.

“Open your arms and embrace it! Accept this paramount power! It shall give you a new life!”

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Load of sh*t!”

Desolate Moon didn’t speak to him anymore, instead waving a hand, and saying, “Go on, go over and suppress him. However, make sure not to kill him. This person is destined to become a Heavenly Venerate, so he’ll be an incredibly important piece.”

These words were targeted at Xiao Yingxiong. The latter had still been in a state of stupification just then, but his eyes immediately moved upon hearing this. He then turned around to face Ling Han.

‘Another battle?’

Ling Han brandished his sword. He was naturally unafraid of Xiao Yingxiong. However, Xiao Yingxiong was a puppet now, so this made him feel like he had to win.

“Die!” Xiao Yingxiong roared, raising his spear and charging forward. His Celestial King power radiated, and his battle prowess soared.

Ding!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and Ling Han was involuntarily astonished. This was because Xiao Yingxiong’s strength had surprisingly increased by a notch.

This… was because of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll!

In such a short period of time, Xiao Yingxiong had already grasped the fourth scroll of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, allowing his battle prowess to increase a notch. Even though this wasn’t shocking, it was still impressive nonetheless.

They continued to do battle. Even though Xiao Yingxiong was being controlled by someone else, his fighting spirit and capabilities remained completely unaffected. His strength was fully unleashed.

In terms of battle prowess alone, he was already no match for Ling Han. He was at a slight disadvantage. Even so, he was completely able to resist and hold on.

After 15 minutes, Xiao Yingxiong’s battle prowess suddenly increased by another notch.

He had grasped the fifth scroll of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll!

This was simply incredible. How was it possible to comprehend a Heavenly Venerate Technique so quickly?

Ling Han refused to believe that Xiao Yingxiong possessed such a powerful comprehension ability. As such, there was only a single explanation for this: Desolate Moon.

More precisely, this was related to the black energy within Xiao Yingxiong. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel astonished. If Desolate Moon trained all of the Celestial Kings here to the Ninth Heaven and then controlled them to charge out, just how devastating would their destructive power be?

What in the world was this person planning?

“Die! Die! Die!” Xiao Yingxiong’s battle prowess continued to increase.
