1571 Blocking Two Consecutive Attacks

Ling Han completely ignored Tan Feng, and his eyes were only focused on Tan Yun. With a thought, a divine light suddenly burst from his body and soared into the sky. This column of light was so brilliant that it could perhaps be seen from an entire planet away.

He was a being from the Immortal Realm—it really couldn’t be any more evident.

Tan Feng wore an expression of absolute astonishment, and it was as if he had been slapped across the face. He was rendered completely speechless.

This was inconceivable! A measly Eternal River Tier elite had actually managed to grasp the Regulations of the Immortal Realm and Netherworld at the same time? This was turning the impossible into possible!

However, he quickly regained his composure, and said, “So what?!”

Was a member of his Tan Clan going to die for nothing? His gaze became cold, and he was just about to launch another attack.

“Hold it there!” Tan Yun suddenly said, stopping him in his tracks.

Tan Feng was extremely domineering, yet he was as obedient as could be before Tan Yun. He immediately stepped back respectfully, though there were question marks floating in his mind. ‘Could it be that Third Elder knows about this Eight Stones Forbidden Land or whatnot? Is he apprehensive because of them?’

Tan Yun gazed at Ling Han, and an idea gradually formed in his mind.

As descendants of cultivators who had been banished from the Celestial Realm, they were all aware of how to return to the Celestial Realm: they needed to fuse the Regulations of the two realms. Doing so would allow them to open the gates to the Celestial Realm. However, in the countless tens of millions of years after being banished, no one had ever managed to achieve this feat.

The Regulations of the two realms were impossible to fuse together, just like fire and water were impossible to fuse together. Regardless of which realm one was in, the Regulations of that realm would always suppress and erase the Regulations that one had grasped from the other realm.

Even coexistence was difficult, so just how difficult would fusion be?

Thus, returning to the Celestial Realm was merely used as a slogan—it was nothing but a dream. Now, however, it was as if they had seen a flicker of hope.

They would pour all of their resources into raising Ling Han such that he could help them open the gates to the Celestial Realm.

They would then kill him after entering. In any case, he would be able to open the gates once he became an Earth Demon. However, there were several Heaven Demons in the Tan Clan. Thus, it wouldn’t make a difference even if fused the Regulations of the two realms and became an Earth Demon. After all, Earth Demons were absolutely no match for Heaven Demons.

Entering the Celestial Realm was a dream of all those who were descendants of those who had been banished from the Celestial Realm. In fact, the importance of this dream was transcendent above all else—including something as serious as the death of an important clan member.

“Don’t rely on some Forbidden Land and whatnot to threaten the Tan Clan,” he said with a chuckle. He naturally couldn’t allow a junior to look down on him, and he continued, “Even Saint Kings will possess nothing but raw power upon entering the Netherworld. They’ll be inferior to even Yellow Demons!”

Ling Han burst into laughter upon hearing this. He was unfazed even in the presence of an Earth Demon. The Hysteria Demon Master and the others couldn’t help but nod in their minds upon seeing this. This young man truly possessed some tremendous courage.

“Senior, even I’m able to fuse the Regulations of the two realms, so the ancestor of my clan has naturally done so as well!” Ling Han started to bluff again. In any case, no one here could call his bluff. If they wanted to, they were welcome to go to the Immortal Realm to verify his claims.

However, Tan Yun was no fool, and he smilingly said, “If an ancestor of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land has already fused the Regulations of the two realms together, then wouldn’t they have returned to the Celestial Realm already?”

This was a hole in his bluff!

Ling Han sucked in a deep breath. He had been too focused on bluffing, yet he had accidentally taken the bluff too far!

His mind whirred, and he said, “How can a lowly Forbidden Land such as yours understand the true power of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land? How about this, I’ll block one of Senior’s attacks to display the strength of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land!”

Everyone was astounded upon hearing this.

Who else spoke like this? Ling Han was referring to Tan Yun as “senior” on the one hand, yet on the other hand, he was denigrating the Tan Clan as a “lowly Forbidden Land”. Just how much disdain did he hold toward them?

However, this young man was truly quite courageous. He was actually offering to withstand the attack of an Earth Demon!

“Sure!” Tan Yun replied calmly. It was as if his emotions hadn’t been affected at all. He raised a hand and grabbed at Ling Han. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This was only a casual strike. However, just how powerful were Earth Demons? The power of Regulations circulated around his hand, and this was accompanied by the stunning brilliance of tens of millions of heavenly bodies. This strike was so powerful that even Yellow Demons wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

‘He has to dodge this. Otherwise, he’ll definitely be caught.’

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, causing a faint layer of golden light to shimmer around his body. Meanwhile, numerous symbols started to light up on the surface of his skin, their structures so complicated and profound that even Heaven Demons wouldn’t be able to comprehend them.

Weng!

Tan Yun’s strike landed, yet it was forcefully blocked by Ling Han!

Pu!

All of the Demon Masters choked in shock upon seeing this, including Tan Feng.

Ling Han had genuinely blocked it! A mere Eternal River Tier junior had genuinely managed to block the strike of an Earth Demon!

Was this for real? Was this really not an act?

Tan Yun retracted his hand, a look of astonishment on his face. He indeed held a very high opinion of Ling Han, him being someone who had fused the Regulations of the two realms at just the Eternal River Tier. This was someone who had the potential to enter the Celestial Realm.

However, that was merely Ling Han’s future potential, not his current power.

‘How terrifying! What kind of freak is he!’

However, Ling Han didn’t feel too good, either. He had faced the attack of an Earth Demon head-on, and only he knew that several of his Godly bones had already been broken. Fortunately, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was incredibly powerful, and it was able to rapidly heal these wounds. It was just that his Origin Power had been completely drained after blocking this attack. Right now, he was in a state of extreme weakness.

He couldn’t hide this from the Demon Masters, yet it was because they could see this clearly that they were even more stunned.

Ling Han had indeed relied on his own power to block the strike of an Earth Demon!

He was truly going to defy the heavens.

A fervent expression instantly appeared in Tan Yun’s eyes. He was certain that Ling Han had practiced some extremely powerful technique—it was because of this that he possessed such astonishing abilities. If the Tan Clan could obtain this inheritance... Gasp!

It was most likely because he practiced this cultivation technique that Ling Han was able to fuse the Regulations of the two realms.

However, he had also claimed that there were 10 elders in the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, all of whom possessed the ability to fuse the Regulations of the two realms. Judging by his performance, there was indeed a chance that this was possible.

If they all charged over, with their battle prowess not diminishing, would the Tan Clan be able to withstand their onslaught?

He silently pondered over this. However, he quickly reached a decision in his mind.

This was a massive opportunity, and he would obtain it for the Tan Clan!

“Young man, why don’t you come to our clan as a guest. If your clan members come, I’ll naturally allow them to take you back.” He reached over again.

Boom!

The sky was instantly blotted out by an indescribably powerful demonic hand.

How was Ling Han going to block this attack?

The ultimate defensive power of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had already been exhausted, and he couldn’t enter the Black Tower, either. Ling Han was already out of options!

The demonic hand pressed down, yet Ling Han’s eyes suddenly lit up, their radiance soaring through the sky.

“Hmm?!” Even Tan Yun faltered slightly upon seeing this. In fact, even he didn’t dare to make contact with this light. He hurriedly retracted his hand.

This was the Light of Dao. Ling Han had received the recognition of heaven and earth after comprehending how to fuse the Regulations of the two realms together, and at the same time, the Light of Dao had also descended from heaven and earth. Ling Han had absorbed this light with his eyes. By unleashing it now, he managed to block another attack from the supreme elite.

‘F*ck!’

The Hysteria Demon Master and the others were all transfixed with shock. If it were them facing Tan Yun, they would only be able to scuttle around like mice. However, this Eternal River Tier elite had actually managed to block two consecutive attacks from Tan Yun!

Although two attacks didn’t seem like much, this was nothing short of a heaven-defying feat. Even they couldn’t help but want to kneel in admiration.

Meanwhile, Tan Feng was rendered completely speechless. This young man was truly an unfathomable freak.

Tan Yun remained unfazed, and he even smiled as he said, “Young man, what other techniques can you use?” He reached over and grabbed at Ling Han for the third time.

How was Ling Han going to block this attack?

Weng!

The large demonic hand reached over, and it was as if both heaven and earth were resonating in unison. When in the Netherworld, Demon Masters represented the will of heaven and earth.

‘How can I block this? What should I do?’
