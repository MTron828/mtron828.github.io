Chapter 3499: Opening Day

Translator: Henyee Translations , Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao were actively making preparations. The Foreign Affairs Department had just been established, and there was yet to be any operations. Furthermore, this department had a lot of power, and there was a lot of profit to be made from it. It was unknown how many people were eyeing It. As long as they made the slightest mistake, there would definitely be a great many ministers that would complain to Chen Fengyan. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The two of them discussed for a while, and began to recruit a limited number of people.

For example, Ling Han had recruited Xuanyuan Dingguo, Yin Xiujing, Lian Xuerong and the others into the department, while Princess Bixiao had taken Hu Er, Hu Taifeng, Xiong Bao, and the other prodigies of the Demon Race under her banner, rapidly increasing the strength of the Foreign Affairs Department.

At first, Princess Bixiao had wanted to contact Hong Tianbu, but Ling Han waved his hand in refusal. The latter would definitely not agree.

-With Hong Tianbu’s prideful nature, to ask him to submit to Ling Han? Hehe.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao studied it for a few days, then decided to move out.

Right now, everyone’s eyes were focused on the Foreign Affairs Department. Thus, their first mission had to be completed successfully.

The first force that they targeted was Yang Lin Sect, which was located in the White Crest Mountains. Sect Master Gu Ping was an elite of Celestial Path, but from the information gathered, this person should be in the Foundation Building Tier.

The first battle naturally had to be fought beautifully. Ling Han first sent someone to deliver a letter, and probe Gu Ping’s opinion. In the end, the latter replied that he was willing to submit to the Dark North Nation, but there were some specific matters that needed to be discussed and negotiated.

Ling Han knew that he was worried about his status after he surrendered.

He and Princess Bixiao moved out together, and did not bring any additional attendants. It was just the two of them, and they set out towards the White Crest Mountains.

The White Crest Mountains were only about three days away from the Imperial Capital, and Ling Han and Princess Bixiao’s speed was also very fast. Thus, they only took two days to arrive.

After the great change of heaven and earth, the originally ordinary White Crest Mountains had also changed greatly. There were mountain peaks that broke through the ground, measuring 9000 meters in height. Looking from the bottom, the midway point of the mountain was enshrouded in clouds and mist, and accumulated snow could not be seen at the summit. Instead, it was still lush and verdant, looking extremely strange.

Just in time. The sun had just risen, so Ling Han told Princess Bixiao to wait for a while, and he began to cultivate.

Absorbing the essence of the Sun and Moon, Ling Han’s cultivation level began to slowly increase.

Why was it only this time every day that was suitable for cultivation?

Ling Han thought that this was the when the sun and moon crossed each other, which had stimulated some kind of change in heaven and earth. As for why it was not appropriate to cultivate at sunset, he was unclear.

Half an hour later, Ling Han stood up, nodded at Princess Bixiao, and said “Let’s go.”

Princess Bixiao humphed. He actually dared to make her, a princess, wait for so long; this brat was really despicable!

When she recalled how Ling Han had once touched her undergarments, and recalled how this guy had flirted with her in front of outsiders, she felt an urge to give this brat a kick.

Who goes there!” They had not even begun climbing the mountain, when a shout was heard from ahead of them. Below the main gate, there were eight young men standing guard. When they saw Ling Han and Princess Bixiao approach, they all stood up and shouted.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I am Ling Han, and I have made an agreement with your Sect Master to pay you a special visit today.”

“So it is Lord Ling!”

Lord Ling, I have always been your admirer.”

“Me too. Can you give me an autograph?”

The eight of them immediately became enthusiastic. They were originally from the Dark North Nation, and after Gu Ping established his own sect, they came here to become disciples. However, they had long since heard of the legend of Ling Han. Now that they had seen him in person, they were naturally excited.

Ling Han smiled as he greeted the eight people. Led earnestly by these people, he and Princess Bixiao ascended the mountain.

Department Chief Ling!” A middle-aged man walked out to receive them He looked ordinary, but it was as if he had fused with the heaven and earth, brimming with Dao.

An elite of the Celestial Path.

It must be Gu Ping.

Ling Han clasped his hands in greeting, and said, “Sect Leader Gu is too polite You are a senior, and an elite, so how would I dare to trouble you to come out to meet me personally?”

“Hahaha!” Gu Ping laughed loudly. He had personally come out to receive two mortals, so this was naturally a matter of lowering his status. However, Ling Han and his companion represented Chen Fengyan, so he had to give them some face. Who asked him to have already decided to submit to the Dark North Nation?

A force that could destroy a Cauldron Forging Tier simply by mobilizing the Formation Spirit was nothing in the galaxy, but for him, this was a colossal creature that he couldn’t afford to trifle with.

However, Ling Han did not put on airs, and knew when to advance or retreat.

This naturally made him very happy.

“Dear guests, please!” He stretched out his hand, and his eyes paused on Princess Bixiao for a moment longer, a sliver of heat in them.

This woman was really beautiful, and what kind of character had he come into contact with in the prison?

However, he didn’t dare to act recklessly, unless he didn’t want to live anymore.

The three of them sat down, and began to discuss the details of what would happen after Yang Lin Sect surrendered.

Submission was not something that could be accomplished with just a few words, especially when Chen Fengyan was the only Celestial Path elite in the Dark North Nation. Others could not control Celestial Path elites at all, and had to come up with a plan.

Of course, Gu Ping was the first to surrender, so he naturally wanted to reap some benefits, such as being bestowed with some official rank.

Gu Ping made an exorbitant demand, immediately asking for the position of Deputy Department Chief. This was naturally refused by Ling Han.

Since he was the first to submit, the Dark North Nation would definitely give him preferential treatment, but it couldn’t possibly be to this extent.

The two sides discussed and negotiated, and spent two days to finally settle the details.

Ling Han would allow Gu Ping to enter the Foreign Affairs Department, but it would only be a position of official, and would be beneath the position of Deputy Department Chief. Furthermore, after submitting, Yang Lin Sect would still be able to maintain considerable independence, but when the Dark North Nation needed it, Yang Lin Sect would also have to listen to orders. Furthermore, they would also have to pay tax, and the members of the sect would have to be registered.

This result could be considered to be satisfactory to everyone. Gu Ping warmly welcomed Ling Han and his companion to stay for a few more days, but Ling Han and his companion both wanted to complete a few more “deals”, and decided to leave on the second day.

The night passed, and Gu Ping personally sent him off.

“Department Chief Ling, Princess Bixiao, this is a small token from me.” Gu Ping waved his hand, and immediately, two people carried over a wooden box each, “Please do not stand on ceremony with me, or I will get angry.”

Ling Han opened the box to take a look. There were three silver-colored fruits inside, and they were filled with a dense aura of life.

Princess Bixiao also opened her wooden box. There was a dark green dress inside.

“This is knitted from the silk of the Jade Fire Silkworm. After wearing it, not only can it disperse a heavy blow, it can also prevent flames from penetrating.” Gu Ping introduced. Everyone knew about the Treasured Fruit of Life, so there was nothing much to say.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. No matter how he looked at it, this gift for Princess

Bixiao was more valuable than his three Treasured Fruits.

As expected, beautiful women were indeed popular.

Princess Bixiao was also overjoyed, and thus did not refuse, accepting this gift. The two of them descended the mountain, and returned to the Imperial City. “Hehe, thankfully, this Gu Ping knows what’s good for him, and did not force me to use this thing.” Ling Han stretched out his hand, and there was a small golden bull in the palm of his hand.

This was the war colossus. After it had recognized Ling Han as its master with a drop of blood, not only would it be able to obey the commands of Ling Han and Princess Bixiao, it would also be able to shrink its size. It could be carried on one’s person, which was really amazing..
