Chapter 629: Talk of A Marriage

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han smiled, and said to Hu Niu, “Hu Niu, someone’s disturbing our meal, what to do?”

“Send them all flying!” Hu Niu said fiercely.

“Then do you want to warm up a bit?” Ling Han asked.

“Alright!” Hu Niu put down her plate. Seeing everyone eyeing them covetously, she couldn’t help but ask, “You guys want to rob Niu’s food?” On the second thought, she said with a smile, “Not delicious anyway, no matter.”

“Hmph, so you don’t dare to act yourself, letting a little girl take the field?” Zhu Xiao Tian sneered. “You’re truly deserving of contempt!”

“Asking for a beating!” Hu Niu charged out, and as her small figure flashed, she already appeared before Zhu Xiao Tian, firing a punch. Pa, it hit Zhu Xiao Tian right in the face, instantly making him have a nosebleed.

Once she attacked, everyone was shocked. This little girl’s speed was so fast, truly surprising.

“Niu will knock you all down!” Once Hu Niu attacked, she couldn’t stop. Her body turned into lightning and flashed in the crowd, pa, pa, pa, sending people flying one after another like scarecrows.

However, it was only the time of a few breaths, yet all those dozen escorts were knocked down by Hu Niu, lying on the ground and groaning in pain.

Jing Shuang Shuang’s body was as if it was frozen. She’d definitely never expected a little girl to be so strong, instantly defeating her pursuers. Although her pursuers were definitely not limited to this amount, these were strongest ones, or else they wouldn’t have qualified to be invited here.

Freak... Where did this little girl come from?

With such a great commotion, the others obviously saw it; quite a few were astounded, while some others revealed an interested look.

“So its Young Master Han!” A girl walked over gracefully, her figure lithe, swaying gently. Her appearance was extremely beautiful, her skin like white jade and black hair like a waterfall, glowing bright. She was extremely beautiful. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She walked over from afar, and the people in her way made way from both sides one after another, their expressions feverish and intoxicated.

She was a beauty one grade higher than Jing Shuang Shuang.

Ling Han looked at her, and said, “You are...”

That girl smiled faintly, and it was instantly like a hundred blowers in blossom, bright and beautiful. She said, “Nong Man Man, also the one who invited you over on Sister Yi Nong’s behalf.”

Ling Han suddenly came to a realization, and said, “You’re Nong Xue Yun’s older sister, or younger sister?”

“Older sister,” Nong Man Man said with a smile. “I invited Young Master Han over, still wanting to discuss whether or not Young Master Han could give up that bottle?”

“Hehe, a mere bottle, was it necessary to invite me here to discuss it?” Ling Han said. “I’m afraid that I don’t have a place to eat? Lady Man Man is so kind to me!”

Nong Man Man involuntarily froze. She wasn’t concerned for Ling Han, and only thought of using such a gathering to pressure Ling Han. She’d never expected that Ling Han would actually intentionally distort it, making her not know how to justify herself in the moment.

“Arrogant one, you dare take advantage of Fairy Nong!?” Many people instantly berated him. Each and every one was exceptional, and their powerful presences started circulating. Everyone shouting simultaneously formed a terrifying pressure.

“You guys dare to be mean to Niu’s Ling Han?” Hu Niu was instantly furious.

“Beat them, beat the crap out of them!” The rabbit only desired to wreak havoc, waving its small claws in instigation.

Pu!

Many people immediately spurted out. This beast actually opened its mouth to talk, truly shocking.

The scene was somewhat chaotic. Nong Man Man gesticulated for everyone to quiet down, and said, “Everyone keep calm! Brother Ling, I’m certainly very interested in that bottle, and if Brother Ling can sell it to me, Man Man will definitely not disappoint Brother Ling.”

“Oh?” Ling Han intentionally sized up Nong Man Man with a smile, and said, “Is Nong Family lacking a son-in-law?”

Nong Man Man’s expression instantly turned gloomy. This youngster was truly dreaming—he’d think of becoming Nong Family’s son-in-law?

“Impudence!” Nong Xue Yun also squeezed through, then pointed angrily at Ling Han, and said, “Who are heck are you, a toad wishing to eat swan meat!?”

The people nearby laughed loudly. Nong Man Man was Nong Family’s beloved daughter, and Nong Family’s ancestor, Nong Bo Xin, was even a Heaven Grade alchemist, being able to parallel Shattering Void Tiers. To marry Nong Family’s precious daughter... how outstanding would the man have to be?

“Oh, Nong Family’s precious daughter is so noble that even Ling Han can’t marry her?” A domineering voice could be heard as Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing arrived together. They were both Spiritual Infant Tier experts, boasting great deterring power.

The people in the surroundings instinctively made way. The people able to come here were obviously all geniuses, but there weren’t many Spiritual Infant Tier ones, and they couldn’t possibly resist Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing’s presence.

Two great Spiritual Infant Tier experts stood by Ling Han’s side with their arms crossed, posing a supportive stance.

Spiritual Infant Tier!

Amongst the younger generation nowadays, there temporarily wasn’t a freak in the Deity Transformation Tier, so Spiritual Infant Tier elites were undoubtedly the strongest. Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing’s battle was well-known, and although they had just broken into the Spiritual Infant Tier, their battle prowess was at least seven to eight stars, being able to fight elites one generation older.

“Hehe, Lady Man Man, if you marry my brother Ling, I’ll give the Snow Dragon Metal I just got as a celebratory gift!” Mu Rong Qing said with a smile, and with a swing of the arm, he tossed out a thoroughly white-colored metal. Its size was not much different from a fist, yet it made many people stare with wide eyes, revealing avaricious looks.

Snow Dragon metal. It was hard to confirm its level because its uses were extremely unique. It needed to be refined and mixed with other rare metals to greatly increase the durability of a forged weapon, allowing seventh tier ingredients to endure eighth tier martial intent.

The upper limit was seventh tier. It was impossible to make an eight tier ingredient into a ninth tier.

Even so, everyone couldn’t help but look at it with their covetous eyes. This chunk of Snow Dragon Metal was fist-sized, and added to a seventh tier rare metal, it was enough to refine an eighth tier weapon that most people would be satisfied with.

Even Nong Man Man’s breathing stiffened, but she revealed an irritated expression. Could she, a dignified descendant of a Heaven Grade alchemist, be “bought” with a single piece of Snow Dragon Metal? No way!

“In your dreams!” she rebuked, feeling like she’d suffered great humiliation.

Ling Han sighed, then patted Mu Rong Qing’s shoulder, and said, “Mu Rong, looks like you’ve got no game. I’d wanted to talk of a marriage, but she turned her nose up at your betrothal gift.”

“What, me?” Mu Rong Qing pointed at his own nose. He revealed a shocked look, and then immediately shook his head, and said, “I don’t want to!”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Then Lady Nong, sorry. My brother isn’t interested in you, so pretend I didn’t say those words earlier!”

Was it really good to play with people like this?

Nong Man Man’s almond-shaped eyes burst with fire, and Jing Shuang Shuang’s expression wasn’t any better. On the other side, Zuo Qiu Le Cheng also requested backup, running over in an aggressive manner and surrounding Ling Han and the others.

“You guys have overdone it!”

“Think you can look down on people of the world with two Spiritual Infant Tier experts?

Everyone looked coldly at Ling Han and the others. Amongst those invited this time, there were a few top geniuses who’d received direct entry to the Restore Heaven Academy. Once they arrived, suppressing Ling Han and the others would be as easy as the turn of a palm.

Weng, weng, weng, a stream-like sound of an instrument suddenly sounded. It was as if a divine sound, and everyone’s tempers suddenly subsided.
