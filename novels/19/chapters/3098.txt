3099 Refining the Meridian Guiding Pill

Earth Element Iron was extremely strong and resistant to heat and cold, so it was extremely difficult to forge it.

Thankfully, all things had their weaknesses. The greatest weakness of Earth Element Iron was a kind of acid. Immerse it in this acid for just one day, and the Earth Element Iron would become very soft. By then, it would be very easy to mold it into various shapes.

And it would naturally be no issue to inscribe patterns in it as well.

Very quickly, the Earth Element Iron had been divided into three portions and molded into the shapes that Ling Han required. The next step was the most crucial, and that was to carve formation patterns in them.

The formation foundations of this Three Elements Formation were easier to construct. However, if one were to go any higher, it was reportedly useless to simply carve formation patterns. One also had to be able to draw upon the terrain and heavenly might. It was incomparably profound.

There was no need for Ling Han to worry about this for the time being. He had completed the formation foundations, and the rest was simple—and that was just pill refinement.

He returned to the Ancient Dao Sect, and looked at the refinement process of the Meridian Guiding Pill in detail. He was already at least 90% confident that he would succeed.

To an alchemy prodigy, this was just a slight change in alchemy techniques. It was not a big deal.

Indeed, the Meridian Guiding Pill was a very simple pill recipe.

Ling Han arrived alone at the place he had chosen previously. He inserted the three formation foundations, and then piled up some jade seeds. In just an instant, boom, the three formation foundations all lit up.

Formations were a means of mobilizing the power of heaven and earth.

An epiphany rose in Ling Han’s heart. In a sense, the principles of the formations in the Genesis World were the same as in this place. It was just that the specific details were different.

Since jade seeds were called seeds, they were naturally not big. Each of them was about the size of a soybean. As the formation activated, each of them seemed to be burning, emitting a dense aura.

After the jade seeds burned for a while, heaven and earth finally reacted. Boom! A powerful force surged and turned into a silver furnace.

How amazing.

Ling Han was astounded. This was completely different from the alchemy of the Genesis World.

Without hesitation, he immediately threw the Meridian Guiding Fruit into the silver furnace.

The furnace was clearly formed from energy, but at this moment, it seemed to have solidified, and could contain the Meridian Guiding Fruit without it falling through the bottom.

What Ling Han needed to do next was to throw out and retrieve the jade seeds in order to control the “fire.”

To an alchemist, what was the most important and most basic skill?

It was fire control.

Therefore, although the specific methods were different now, the logic was the same.

Ling Han alternated between adding jade seeds and retrieving them again. One moment, he would take a seed from the first formation foundation and place it on the second, and the next moment, he would take a seed from the second and third formation foundations, and place it on the first formation foundation.

About an hour later, the jade seeds had “burned” completely. On the surface, there were only a few cracks, but with a slight pinch, they would disintegrate into powder.

Clap! Clap! Clap! Seven pills fell from the sky.

Ling Han shot forward and caught all seven pills.

He broke into a smile. ‘The pill recipe says that as long as you can refine pills, you can refine three to 10 pills in a single furnace. These seven pills of mine can be considered a pass.’

This wasn’t just a passing grade. Very few people could successfully refine Meridian Guiding Pills on their first try, and even famous formation alchemists could only produce seven or eight pills. 10 was only theoretically the largest number possible.

Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor. He had been in the past, and he was still the Alchemy Emperor now.

Ling Han put away the alchemical pills, feeling very satisfied. If he were to sell them, he would be able to trade one for at least 1,000 jade seeds.

The effect of the Meridian Guiding Pill was much better than the Meridian Guiding Fruit. Therefore, if the Meridian Guiding Fruit could be sold for 100 jade seeds, it would not be too much to multiply the price for the Meridian Guiding Pill, right?

Ling Han returned to his residence, and thought to himself, ‘How should I sell the Meridian Guiding Pill?’

For the current him, it was a little like the winds howling around the highest peaks[1]. He had just won 700 jade seeds. If others knew that he sold seven Meridian Guiding Pills, wouldn’t it be equivalent to asking others to rob him?

The key problem was that he was too weak.

“That’s right!”

He turned on his optical computer. Weng, the image of a beautiful girl appeared.

“Is there an auction house here?” Ling Han asked.

“I’m sorry, but the Wide Area Network has been destroyed. We can’t check the main server,” the optical computer girl replied. “However, there’s an anonymous black market here. Perhaps it can meet your requirements.”

“Oh, bring up the information.” Ling Han nodded.

The optical computer brought up the information. Ling Han looked at it carefully, and a look of contemplation appeared on his face.

This black market should have been initially set up by the Ancient Dao Sect’s disciples. At that time, some disciples had gone adventuring outside and obtained some treasures, but they didn’t want others to know, so they used this kind of method of trading while keeping their identities secret.

As time passed, more and more people adopted this method. Moreover, it gradually grew and gained a fixed location for transactions.

In black market transactions, one had to have their own eyes[2]. If they bought fake goods, they would definitely not be able to find the seller to return them.

“It’s on the west side of Haiping Mountain. If I go a little further west, that’s the territory of the Demonic Beasts,” Ling Han muttered. This place was truly remote.

‘Should I go?’

Ling Han hesitated slightly before deciding to go. He wanted to buy a Spirit Gathering Formation.

The so-called Spirit Gathering Formation was used to extract the power from jade seeds and amplify the cultivation speed of a cultivator.

However, the method to create the formation foundations for the Spirit Gathering Formation could not be found in the optical computer. Only the formation alchemists could create could be found, and there were restrictions on its usage. It would break after being filled with jade seeds a few times. If one still needed to use it, he could only buy it again.

Ling Han prepared a cloak and a new set of clothes for himself. Then, when the night had fallen, he headed west.

The black market only opened at night, from midnight until around three o’clock.

The distance was about 15 km, but the mountain path was rugged and not easy to walk on. Fortunately, Ling Han’s physique had been greatly enhanced in the past few days, and his physical power was much stronger than that of ordinary people.

After walking 15 km in one breath, he was only panting and sweating from exhaustion, and it had not reached the point that he wanted to sprawl out and rest.

He could not help but feel a little emotional. It was only 15 km. If it was in the past… L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘Forget it, let’s not talk about the past. That is a completely different world.’

He changed into his new clothes in the bushes, and put on a cloak and covered his face. Then, he walked out and continued forward.

Before long, he arrived at the black market.

Although this was a marketplace, it didn’t have any signboards. It was just a huge rocky field with many people sitting cross-legged on it. In front of each of them was a piece of cloth with items for sale.

Some people had lamps beside them, so they could be seen clearly. Some people didn’t have lamps prepared, so the buyer could only rely on the moonlight to look at the goods. Otherwise, they would have to bring their own lamps.

Ling Han also walked over and found a secluded place to sit down. Then, he took out a pill bottle and placed it in front of him. He closed his eyes and rested. He needed to conserve his energy. He still had to practice his fist technique tomorrow morning.

There were many people who came to the black market. Very quickly, someone came to Ling Han’s “stall,” and asked, “What medicine are you selling?”

[1] Because MC stands out so much, he would attract a lot of attention, most likely negative attention.

[2] Means they have to watch out for themselves.
