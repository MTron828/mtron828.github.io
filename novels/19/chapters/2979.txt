2980 Successful Retreat

Without any hesitation, Ling Han turned around and left.

At present, he was only barely qualified to stand against a Seventh Tier, but if he naively considered himself as being capable of defeating a Seventh Tier, that would really be courting death.

When he advanced to the Sixth Tier, so what if his opponent was a Seventh Tier? He would suppress him!

“Stinky old bastard, we’ll meet again as long as time stands. Goodbye!” Ling Han tore a rip into the Void, and directly fled.

“Still trying to escape?” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains smirked coldly. Boom, he finally exploded with his full power, and 36 seals on his body lit up at the same time.

First-grade seals!

Shatter Mountains had actually mastered 36 first-grade seals, and they were combination seals at that. This caused his power to spike by close to 2000 times all of a sudden.

This was not inferior to Ling Han’s boost, and his basic power was much higher than Ling Han’s in the first place, so it was naturally even more terrifying.

The wings of light formed by the six fundamental powers flapped rapidly, causing Shatter Mountains’s speed to soar to the extreme, allowing him to rapidly close the distance between them.

Seeing Shatter Mountains reveal his trump card, Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief.

He was really afraid that Shatter Mountains would channel all the first-grade seals in one go. That kind of explosive power might be able to reach 4,000 or 5,000 times. Then, it would really be able to insta-kill Ling Han.

Thankfully, it was equivalent to both their power amplification having been removed. Ling Han was no match for his enemy, but he could still resist for a while.

…The wishful thinking of Shatter Mountains was naturally his hoping to exhaust the energy release of Ling Han’s seventh-grade combination seals. Only then would he suddenly explode, and the chance of killing Ling Han would naturally be even higher.

Now that it looked like Ling Han was about to flee, he had no choice but to change his mind, and reveal his trump card in advance.

However, with the six wings of light moving at the same time, the speed was really too great, so great that just when Ling Han entered into the Void, before the rip had even closed, Shatter Mountains had already charged over. Boom, he delivered a palm strike, and the six fundamental powers manifested, forming six divine weapons that struck out at Ling Han, each boosted with terrifying power.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily focused. He didn’t know this move himself.

In terms of the use of fundamental power, Shatter Mountains surpassed him far too much.

It could not be helped. After all, he was a Seventh Tier that had come from the Genesis World of the last era. Merely in this aspect, perhaps even Lin Luo, Xin Fu, and the others would not be a match for a veteran Seventh Tier.

Ling Han threw out the Fists of Fury in response. Boom, power surged, and a howl resounded within the Void.

Ling Han was sent flying backwards, and he felt like his body was about to be split into pieces.

Though both of them had increased their power by more than 2000 times, which seemed fair, the power created by the impact had also increased greatly. For Ling Han’s physique, this was a massive test.

Pu! He vomited a mouthful of blood, and felt that his vision was a little blurry.

Even if Shatter Mountains had the advantage in terms of power, he was still stunned for a moment. When he caught up again, Ling Han had already torn a rip into the Void and left.

He was much stronger than Ling Han, but he was like a blind man in the Void. He could only fumble his way back, but could not open a new path.

Wasn’t Hysteria even stronger than him? If it had had the same ability as Ling Han, it would have long since extended its tentacles into various dimensions, engulfing even Genesis World.

Peng, Ling Han fell out, and his head hit the ground as he panted heavily.

Even though it was merely just a single exchange, just a single strike, it had already caused Ling Han to suffer serious injury.

After his power had reached its limit, there would also be a huge requirement on the physique. For example, Ling Han had only lost because of his physique. It was clear that there was not much of a gap between them in power.

“The improvement of the physique can only depend on the tempering of fundamental power, but I have only grasped four types now. Compared to the Seventh Tier, there is still a gap. I am at too much of a disadvantage.”

Ling Han forcefully sat in a cross-legged position, mumbling to himself as he consumed healing-type Great Herbs.

At first, he had thought that now that he had advanced to the Fifth Tier, his strength had increased, and he had gained the qualifications to match a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. In truth, all he could do was withstand a few blows—in fact, when a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate unleashed their full might, he could only take one blow.

“I can either advance to the Sixth Tier, or think of some way to make my physique become stronger.

“It’s too difficult to advance to the Sixth Tier, and according to my situation, the crimson Great Herb should be ineffective for me.

“So, all I can do now is think of some way to make my physique stronger.

“Though the unique Power of Dimension can’t compare to the fundamental power, with so many Powers of Dimension in my body combined together, it should not be inferior to fundamental power.

“All right, I’ll reunite with Jianxue and the others first, then head to the Genesis World of the last era. I want to obtain even more Great Herbs so that the dimensions in my body can grow rapidly.”

Ling Han gnawed on the Great Herbs, and quickly suppressed his injuries. However, the attack of a Seventh Tier was too terrifying, and he would not be able to recover for a short while.

It couldn’t be helped. Heavenly Venerable Tier elites were hated by the heavens. Once they were wounded, the heaven and earth would naturally seize this opportunity to target them.

Fortunately, the Genesis World of the last era still produced healing Great Herbs. Otherwise, Ling Han could only endure it bit by bit. It wasn’t impossible for Heavenly Venerates to die if they couldn’t endure it.

After recovering slightly, Ling Han rushed to meet up with the Empress and the others.

Previously, when he had told Ling Xi and the others to leave, he had also informed them of the whereabouts of the Empress and Hu Niu. They all knew where to meet up.

Not long after, Ling Han returned to Peaceful Leaf City.

“Ling Han!”

“Father!”

“Fourth Brother!”

Everyone gathered around him. After a separation of tens of billions of years, everyone had undergone a great change. The most exaggerated was Ling Han, who could even save people from the hands of a Seventh Tier now.

Ling Han nodded with a smile, and said, “It’s all because of me. I’ve implicated everyone.”

“Haha, to be able to be the guest of a Seventh Tier, having enough food and drink, how many people would be able to enjoy such a good thing?” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable said with a smile.

This made everyone laugh. Thinking about it, it was true. How many people could make a Seventh Tier apprehensive and capture them without killing them? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, the large black dog howled, “Little Han, since you now possess the power of a Seventh Tier, shouldn’t we establish our own sect?”

Ling Han shook his head. “I can just barely match a Seventh Tier, and am still far from being a qualified opponent.”

Everyone couldn’t help but fall silent. In other words, under the abuse of power of a Seventh Tier, they could only live in seclusion.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I plan to go to the Genesis World of the last era again to improve my strength. At that time… I’ll be able to truly stand against a Seventh Tier.”

When they heard these words, everyone nodded.

Throughout his whole journey, Ling Han had already fully proven his freakish talent. Since he was so confident, he would definitely be able to do it.

Everyone decided to endure silently for the moment. When Ling Han truly possessed the ability to match a Seventh Tier, it would be the day that they would be able to hold their heads high.

Ling Han didn’t bring anyone with him, and he set out alone.

It would be too dangerous to travel to dimensions below the 10th level of the Genesis World of the last era. Even with the protection of a Spatial Celestial Tool that was forged from Devouring Metal, it would be useless. It would only be sending them to their deaths.

Thus, Ling Han could only act alone.

However, before setting out, Ling Han first went to Zhou Heng’s place.

He was very curious about one thing, and that was the identity of Jue Huo. Shatter Mountains and the others actually called her Extermination. What was going on here?
