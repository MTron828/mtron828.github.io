Chapter 1535 I want to kill the Sain

Ling Han actually said he wanted to kill Hu Yingmu?

This... He had to be joking.

True, Ling Han was indeed very strong, and had even reached a nature-defying extent. He had taken two attacks from a Saint forcefully, but even so, not one person believed that Ling Han truly was qualified to stand against a Saint.

That was completely unreal.

Otherwise, why had you come to the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy? Who would be worthy of teaching you?

When Ling Han had entered the eighth campus, if it hadn’t been for Ren Feiyun stepping out to save him, he would probably have been forced to crawl through the dog’s hole. How could he possibly have the abilities to match a Saint?

Everyone shook their heads, and thought that Ling Han had lost his own measure in his pride.

“Senior Brother Ling, forget it. Since this stray dog has already admitted defeat, we will just be generous, and spare him just this once.”

“That’s right, Senior Brother Ling, there is no need to drop down to his level.”

“In any case, whatever he says is nonsense.”

All the students advised, and deliberately disparaged Hu Yingmu so Ling Han would cool his temper.

Yet Hu Yingmu had exploded in fury. He was really like a tiger that had gone down to level land; even these damn little bugs dared to ridicule him[1]? These idiots had completely no idea that he had already sent out news, and in a short few days, the ancestor from his clan would reach this place. By that time, wouldn’t that so-called Great Saint only be suppressed?

He turned around menacingly. “Brat, you really want to fight me?”

He did not mind taking Ling Han down first. In that way, the secret technique of the Celestial King would definitely belong to him alone—he was sure that Ling Han had definitely cultivated a Celestial King technique. Otherwise, he could not possibly have such frightening defenses.

In the face of such a secret technique, so what if he was one of his own clansmen? Even if he had his own descendants in future, it could not be passed down as easily as that.

This was too precious!

“Old man, you are too shameless!”

“That’s right, a respected Saint would actually challenge an Eternal River Tier; why don’t you just die?”

Everyone laughed mockingly. They did not want Ling Han to accept the challenge at all.

“Ling Han, enough,” the Star Sand Saint said as well. At present, he was filled with a strong desire to preserve talent. No matter what sacrifices had to be made, he was determined to protect Ling Han. As long as this boy managed to become a Saint, he would possess the strength that could allow him to conquer the whole world.

Ling Han did not say anything, and instead began to channel that drop of blood essence from the Saint King.

Hu Yingmu actually dared to have ideas about the Empress; he could not tolerate that! If the Star Sand Saint had killed Hu Yingmu, he naturally would not have stepped out aggressively, but it was apparent that the Star Sand Saint was wary.

Then, he’d just do it himself!

Boom, saintly might filled Ling Han’s body. This was a drop of blood essence from a Saint King deliberately left behind by the Heavenly River King. It had lasted through eons, and could allow Ling Han to explode once. He could even become a match for a Great Saint.

It would be enough to kill a Small Saint.

“What?!” Everyone was stunned. This was saintly might; it could not be more obvious.

Golden light entwined around Ling Han’s body, becoming multiple seals of Great dao. It was sacred, highest, as if the Heavenly Dao itself had arrived.

This was the saintly might of a Saint King taking form.

Pa, pa, pa, pa. All the common people knelt, and even those rank three king tiers like the Second in the World and Zi Chenfeng were not exempted, either. There was nothing that could be done. This was the might of a Saint King that stood above all.

Those that could still remain standing were only those Saints. Besides them, there was also the Empress, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden... and the large black dog! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You have obtained the blood essence of a Saint King, and it is a complete drop too!” Hu Yingmu paled in shock. This was the first time that he could feel how true the threat this man posed to him was.

Ling Han’s eyes were menacing. He did not say anything. This was merely a man that was about to die.

“You want to kill me, in your dreams!” Hu Yingmu could only answer his own question. “Our Eight Stones Forbidden Land is strongest in prediction. Even if you flee to the corners of the world, your only fate will still be death.”

This was an indirect admission of his fear. “Don’t even think of killing me; otherwise, you will not be able to escape, either.” This was what he was saying between the lines.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s mind. At the time, Hu Can and his group had actually managed to so coincidentally find them out because they had obtained guidance from the ancestor of their clan who had gained the information through prediction. But, this ability of prediction obviously was still very inadequate. Otherwise, Hu Can and his group would not have died.

This kind of ability could not be underestimated, but it was also definitely not omnipotent, either.

“Ling Han, think before you act.” The Star Sand Saint did not advise him further, and merely reminded him. The present Ling Han was too strong; he could even equal him in power.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I have considered carefully; I am determined to stomp this damn bug to death!”

‘F*ck!’ Hu Yingmu cursed internally, but did not dare to say a word. Instead, he turned around and fled.

The man had channelled a drop of blood essence from a Saint King, and his present abilities were enough to equal a Great Saint; how was he supposed to fight that! The precious robe he was wearing could only endure over 100 attacks, and would crumble after this limit was reached.

“Want to flee?” Ling Han smirked. Since he had even used the blood essence of a Saint King, how could he easily allow him to flee?

He moved, and his hand was large enough to shadow the skies, grabbing out towards Hu Yingmu.

At this moment, Ling Han himself was a Great Saint!

When a Great Saint moved, a Small Saint could not possibly dodge, and could only take the attack up front. It was just like how Ling Han could not possibly dodge Hu Yingmu’s attack previously.

Boom, the precious robe glowed, and divine patterns shone brilliantly. This meant it had exploded with great might, and forcibly blocked Ling Han’s attack.

Ling Han naturally did not take it to heart. Though there was a time limit to the blood essence of a Saint King, it was definitely enough time for him to send out not just 100 attacks.

In other words, Hu Yingmu was dead.

To dare make a move to snatch his wife; who would be dying if not him?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han thrashed Hu Yingmu so madly that he could only be beaten.

Everyone was watching open-mouthed with shock, and recalled something that they had overlooked.

In truth, Ling Han had no need to have the agreement of a single move with the other party, and could completely make a direct move to cripple him. Why had Ling Han taken such an indirect course, then?

That was because Ling Han wanted Hu Yingmu to lower his head and apologize!

Otherwise, for someone as proud as Hu Yingmu, even if he was killed by Ling Han, how could he possibly open his mouth and admit his fault?

This was working off his anger!

First making you apologize, and then killing you.

“Senior Brother Ling is formidable!”

“Senior Brother Ling is imperious!”

“Senior Brother Ling, I want to have your babies!”

Everyone’s cries resounded together. A great many female disciples had forgotten to be reserved, and even Long Xiangyue very much wanted to shout as well.

Ling Han moved continuously. With the support of the blood essence of a Saint King, his power had reached an unimaginable level.

His grasp of technique had not improved, but when power had reached a certain extent, that would naturally form suppression. Moreover, the blood essence of the Saint King also possessed the Regulations on the level of Saint King, though Ling Han could not understand or freely control it. He could only blast it out in one attack after another.

This could not be used for comprehension, but could be used in battle.

Hu Yingmu’s condition began to worsen. His precious robes were seriously consumed underneath the endless attacks. One after another, seals darkened and cracks began to appear.

He gritted his teeth. Since his opponent had even used the blood essence of a Saint King, he was obviously determined to kill him, so there was no point to even beg for mercy, and he, too, could not possibly beg for mercy from an ant. He still had that much amount of a backbone in him.

He was not resigned to this. He was an honourable Saint; furthermore, he was one who had walked out from the Forbidden Land. Yet, he would actually be killed by a junior in the Eternal River Tier. Even if he was dead, this would mean eternal humiliation, and his name would be infamous in history.

He tried his best to break out of the siege.
