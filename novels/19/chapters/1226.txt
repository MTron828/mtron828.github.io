Chapter 1227: Victory Again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill was definitely one of the top Level Seven Divine Pills, both in terms of medicinal effects and in terms of refinement difficulty.

Alchemist Li... didn’t know how to refine it!

The Treasure Forest Pavilion was extremely influential, and elders like Alchemist Li could also be regarded as extremely loyal. Thus, he naturally had the trust of the Treasure Forest Pavilion. As long as the level was right, the Treasure Forest Pavilion would unconditionally provide him with whatever pill recipe he wanted to learn.

The Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill was an ancient recipe, yet the Treasure Forest Pavilion still possessed a copy.

Alchemist Li had also studied it, though he had failed to refine it even after several hundred attempts. After so many failures, he didn’t dare to refine it again.

He couldn’t afford so many failures!

Alchemists were indeed rich, but Level Seven ingredients also cost money, right? Not only did they cost money, but they were expensive beyond belief!

He really wanted to stand his ground and announce that he was also going to refine the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill. However, he truly had no confidence. His expression became solemn. If Ling Han genuinely succeeded in refining the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill, it wouldn’t matter what pill he refined, nor would it matter how perfect his result was. There would only be one possibility—defeat.

‘Impossible! I don’t believe it!

‘How can this brat surpass me in alchemy? If he does, won’t my 2,000,000 years of experience have been completely wasted?!’

“I’ll refine... the Four Clouds Four Rising Pill!”

This was the most difficult Level Seven Divine Pill that he could refine. Although it was inferior to the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill, at least it wasn’t so inferior that he would appear weak.

They prepared their ingredients, and then started to refine.

Meanwhile, He Jingyun had already been dug out from the ground. His face was colorful with blood and dirt. Logically speaking, he should have left after suffering such great humiliation. Otherwise, just being glanced at would be utterly humiliating.

However, he didn’t want to leave. He wanted to personally witness this alchemy match; he wanted to see Ling Han lose.

However, he noticed that something was off right away.

Ling Han appeared much more relaxed than Alchemist Li!

One had to realize that the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill was more difficult to refine than the Four Clouds Four Rising Pill, yet Ling Han actually appeared more relaxed. What did this signify?

This signified that they were on two completely different levels!

It was a shame that Alchemist Li couldn’t see this. After all, he couldn’t let his attention waver a single bit.

The Four Clouds Four Rising Pill was the most difficult pill that he could refine. However, he couldn’t guarantee a 100% success rate when refining this pill. Thus, he was naturally extremely careful and focused.

Level Seven Divine Pills took even longer to refine—20 days was a minimum. Meanwhile, Level Eight Divine Pills would require a minimum of one month to refine.

The onlookers went about their own businesses again. Apart from the members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion and Han Lin Pavilion, the other people all returned to their daily lives. It wouldn’t be too late if they came back in a fortnight or so.

However, Alchemist Li’s refinement failed after just 16 days.

His cauldron exploded.

Peng!

There was a heavy crack as his cauldron exploded. Fortunately, the explosion wasn’t violent. There was no other damage apart from his cauldron exploding. If the explosion had been more serious, it was entirely possible that more than half of the people present would have been injured or killed.

The old man was disconsolate. His cauldron had actually exploded! Right now, he could only hope that Ling Han’s cauldron would also explode. Otherwise, Ling Han would win as long as he successfully refined his pills.

Several days passed, and Ling Han finally stopped refining. He slapped the cauldron lid heavily. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Peng!

There was a soft clang, and three alchemical pills flew into the air. They were shrouded in a brilliant divine light.

He had succeeded!

Alchemist Li instantly slumped to the ground. His opponent had actually refined the Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pill! Even if he hadn’t failed, he would have still had to admit defeat. Moreover, his opponent hadn’t just succeeded—he had concocted a whopping three pills!

This was terrifying!

Ling Han grabbed the three Spiritual Rain Bone Developing Pills with a smile, and said, “Alchemist Li, do you want to examine them?”

“N-no, it’s fine!” Alchemist Li stammered dejectedly. He had personally witnessed Ling Han’s refinement during the last few days. His smooth and experienced movements had been especially pleasing to the eye. His alchemy skills were definitely miles ahead of his.

He picked himself up and pushed the onlookers aside as he left. His figure appeared frail and forlorn.

Everyone sighed upon seeing this. This was a Level Seven alchemist!

The alchemists of the Treasure Forest Pavilion hurriedly chased after him, trying to console him and raise his spirits. Was there any need to take this loss so seriously?

Alchemist Li smiled, and said, “A promise is a promise. I’ll never return to Big Trade City again! However... I only said that I would leave the Big Trade City. I never said that I would leave the Treasure Forest Pavilion. So, it’s entirely fine for me to go to a branch in some other city.”

‘F*ck!’

Everyone grimaced upon hearing this. Sure enough, experience came with age. After all this commotion, he was still a member of the Treasure Forest Pavilion. It was just that he would have to head to another branch. However, did alchemists care where they refined pills?

Anyhow, being forced out of Big Trade City was still a stain on his name.

The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion all left in shame. They had achieved emphatic victories in the beginning, yet they had suffered two resounding defeats in the end. They couldn’t invite a Level Eight alchemist at the moment, so retreating was naturally their only option. Staying here would merely be asking for more humiliation.

This was an alchemy competition, so the Treasure Forest Pavilion couldn’t act wantonly even if they possessed numerous very powerful elites. After all, some rules had to be followed.

“Our respects to Grandmaster Ling!” Yun Yong Wang, Kang Xiu Yuan, and the other members of the Han Lin Pavilion all bowed respectfully to Ling Han. Their expressions were full of respect and veneration.

Ling Han was young, yet his alchemy skills were clear for all to see. Was a Level Seven alchemist not impressive?

In any case, Ling Han deserved this level of respect. Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan were his disciples anyway, so it was only natural that they bowed to him. He casually raised a hand, and said, “Rise!”

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan invited Ling Han into the interior of the pavilion. The exterior would naturally be cleaned up by others. Meanwhile, the alchemy competition had attracted many customers to the Han Lin Pavilion, causing their business to go up explosively.

“Grandmaster, may I ask why you helped us?” Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan asked curiously.

With Ling Han’s alchemy skill, he could have easily entered the Treasure Forest Pavilion and mapped out a brighter future. So, why did he insist on joining their relatively weak pavilion? In fact, he was even willing to offend the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

Ling Han drank some tea, and then replied, “I’m deeply acquainted with your master.”

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan exchanged a glance. They didn’t understand what he meant by “deeply acquainted”. One had to realize that they had arrived in the Immortal Realm 10,000 years ago. Moreover, it was clear that... no one else from the Lower Realm could ascend to the Immortal Realm. Those who had ascended were all members of the Five Sects.

“I ascended from the Lower Realm a few years ago,” Ling Han said. He decided to divulge a bit of his secret.

“What?!” Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan both jumped up at the same time. Their minds were numb with shock.

‘Lower Realm... He’s actually from the Lower Realm!’

Kang Xiu Yuan shook his head in disbelief, and exclaimed, “How is that possible? Who doesn’t know that the Lower Realm is controlled by the Five Sects? Even Shattering Void Tier elites will be killed by the large formation set by the Five Sects if they try to shatter the void, to say nothing of opening the sky.”

Opening the sky meant that one had to shatter the restriction set by the Five Sects. Was this possible?

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Nothing in the world is impossible. So what if they’re the Five Sects? Can they blot out the heaven with one hand and act as they please?”

‘Is this real?’

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan looked at each other. They felt as if the efforts of them three brothers over the past 10,000 years had all been for nothing.
