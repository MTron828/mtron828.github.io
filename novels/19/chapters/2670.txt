2671 Never expected this, right?

Qin Shuang yelled in pain. The damage this attack caused to him was truly too great.

However, Ling Han’s offensive did not end at that.

Ling Han raised his left hand, and zi, nine-colored light flickered as he pressed his palm down on Qin Shuang.

Qin Shuang was already no longer capable of changing his course, so he could only take this strike head-on.

Clang!

His palm landed, and Qin Shuang’s whole person exploded. The might of this strike was in no way inferior to the slash from the Divine Demon Sword.

Ling Han panted, but his movements did not pause. Picking up his sword, he continued his pursuit.

Qin Shuang had indeed been blasted quite badly, his whole person torn into pieces. However, his head was still complete, so he did not die. For Celestial Kings, this was not a fatal injury. As long as Qin Shuang was given some time, he would be able to regrow his limbs and recover his battle prowess very quickly.

Ling Han had used the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll in the first strike, increasing his battle prowess countless times over, and he had channeled the Five Elements Lightning Technique in his second strike. Though he had not channeled the two Heavenly Venerate Techniques at the same time, the gap between his use of them was really too short, so it still caused his blood to bubble, and made him feel very terrible.

But now was not the time for rest. He should take the chance to follow up on his attack, and kill his enemy in a single stroke.

How was a head going to compete with Ling Han in speed?

Ling Han caught up to him, and followed up with a strike from his sword.

Pu! Qin Shuang’s head was pierced right through with the Divine Demon Sword. His mind crumbled, and he ultimately died.

Ling Han withdrew his sword, and grabbed out with both hands. He immediately grabbed over the Spatial God Tool that Qin Shuang had carried on him.

“This formation technique is not bad. In the future, Grandpa Dog will no longer have to worry that anyone will be able to flee from him.” The large black dog took away the core that controlled the formation that Qin Shuang had on him. He began to eagerly stow the formation away.

Ling Han was also interested in this formation, but the large black dog couldn’t just help him for nothing, after all. Otherwise, it would be difficult to ask him for help again in the future. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ling Han extended his divine sense into Qin Shuang’s Spatial God Tool and did a sweep. An alchemical pill appeared in his hand.

Though he was already a Five-Star Alchemist, he still could not recognize this alchemical pill. However, he could be certain that there was a powerful aura contained within. In fact, it was superior even to great Celestial-King-Tier pills.

Thinking back to what Qin Shuang had previously said, about how he had moved out because he had received a Heavenly Venerate Pill from Ma Yuhai… then this was the Heavenly Venerate Pill.

“Heavenly Venerate Pill, what is its use?” Ling Han knew this was something good, but did not know its exact effects.

“What, Heavenly Venerate Pill? Quick, give it to Grandpa Dog!” The large black dog immediately leaped over, stretching out his paw shamelessly.

Ling Han hurriedly stowed away the Heavenly Venerate Pill. “Scram, you have already taken a formation technique, and you still want this as well?”

“This is a treasure, after all. The more, the better!” The large black dog was extremely shameless. It was impossible to make him feel conscientious.

Ling Han only gave him the middle finger.

Only then did the large black dog say, “A Heavenly Venerate Pill is a biological precious medicine concocted when a Heavenly Venerate extracts his own blood essence combined with his personal martial intent. It would be greatly beneficial even to Celestial Kings. However, it would be best if Grandpa Dog ingested it; it can help Grandpa Dog advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier much sooner.”

Ling Han merely chuckled. This damn dog’s eyes were spinning endlessly when he was talking; who the f*ck would believe him?

Ling Han stowed away Qin Shuang’s Celestial Tool. The large black dog also helped him to suppress it, erasing the martial intent contained within, and making it easier for the Divine Demon Sword to devour it. On this point, the large black dog did not say anything, because the issue of whether the Divine Demon Sword could advance to become a Heavenly Venerate Tool was a matter that implicated the serious problem of whether the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable could be revived or not.

“Brat, do you want Grandpa Dog to accompany you to the appointment?” the large black dog asked as he continued to play around with the foundation stone of the formation that he had just obtained. This was very simple. There were only four pillars, but after they were buried in the ground, the area that the four pillars enclosed would become an independent space.

“No need.” Ling Han shook his head. If it was only Ma Yuhai, he naturally would not take it to heart.

The man and dog went their separate ways. The large black dog still had to get more Divine Metal. Following the beginning of the cooperation with the Wang Clan, the day for the Divine Demon Sword to advance was getting closer and closer, and it also made the large black dog become very motivated.

Because Ling Han had delayed a very long time on the way here, when he arrived at Great Fiery Mountain, the day was close to ending.

“He’s not coming, is he?” On the mountain, a great many people had deliberately come to watch the battle, but they had already waited until the moon was hanging high in the skies, and the day was about to end in just a little bit more time, yet there was still no sight of Ling Han. Then, it was likely impossible for him to still come.

“Has he shrunk from battle?”

“It can’t be, can it? Previously, hasn’t Ling Han defeated Ma Yuhai with a single move? Why would he be afraid now?”

“It can only be said that it was Ma Yuhai who had been careless before, and Ling Han had just won in a stroke of good fortune. Now that he knows that there is no way that he will succeed two times, he has cowered.”

“Hehe, I didn’t think he was this kind of person.”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly, while Ma Yuhai revealed a smirk.

Not only did Ma Yuhai want Ling Han to die, he also wanted to redeem his fortune. Otherwise, how was it possible that the little princess of the Wang Clan changed her mind about him?

Ma Yuhai was very aware that there was no way Ling Han could come. With Qin Shuang moving, Ling Han should have long since been lying dead somewhere.

And as for Ma Yuhai? He had been waiting here in full public all this while, so he naturally had absolutely nothing to do with Ling Han’s death.

Ma Yuhai spread out a hand, and said, “Everyone, it is a disappointment. Please return.”

Everyone stood up, their heart filled with disdain for Ling Han; to think he had actually cowered from battle.

“The day has not yet ended; why is everyone in such a rush?” An even voice rang out.

Everyone paused.

Ling Han, it was Ling Han—he was finally here.

Meanwhile, Ma Yuhai’s expression changed drastically. Why was Ling Han here?

Then what about Qin Shuang? Could it be that he had not managed to ambush Ling Han?

If that was the case, that would be fine, and Ling Han clearly would not know Ma Yuhai’s scheme. However, if Qin Shuang had already made his move, and Ling Han had still appeared here, the problem about that would be huge.

Ma Yuhai couldn’t stop trembling. What on earth had happened?

Ling Han strode forwards, and arrived at the summit, where he faced Ma Yuhai directly. He smiled. “When you see me appear, you must be very stunned, right?”

Ma Yuhai forcefully retained his composure. “What would I be stunned by? It was I that asked you out for this battle, and it was you procrastinating and only appearing at this moment.”

Ling Han set his eyes on Ma Yuhai, and after a good few breaths’ time, he finally said, “You asked someone to ambush me on the way here, planning to kill me. Seeing me appear alive and well, you must be feeling very perturbed, right?”

‘What?!’

Hearing Ling Han’s words, a flurry of commotion exploded among the spectators in an instant.

Was that really the case?

“It’s quite logical. Otherwise, Ma Yuhai has clearly suffered a terrible defeat, and there is no clear improvement in his strength, so what is the reason he would dare to challenge Ling Han to a battle again?”

“Hiss, that is too underhanded, isn’t it?”

“Hehe, if the martial academy interrogated the murderer, and he confessed everything, even Lord Ma Feng would not be able to save him. At the very least, he would be expelled from the martial academy. That would truly be an extreme humiliation.”

Ma Yuhai’s hands were tightly clenched into fists. His heart was also filled with unease. What if Qin Shuang had really been apprehended, and confessed the truth of how the two of them had collaborated together and schemed to kill a disciple of the martial academy? He would be done for.

Just when he was in a daze, Ling Han suddenly sped up, and arrived right in front of Ma Yuhai in a quick leap before throwing a punch at him.

Clang!

Ma Yuhai was instantly sent flying from this strike. While in midair, he already spluttered out a mouthful of blood, along with a considerable number of teeth.

…If he hadn’t been so distracted, he would definitely not have been sent flying with a single slap like this, but who asked for chaos to run wild inside his heart now? Added with the fact that Ling Han’s burst of speed was really too fast, Ma Yuhai had once again fallen with a single strike from Ling Han.

Ma Yuhai collapsed onto the ground, blowing up a layer of dust. He was just about to scramble to his feet when he felt a weight on his face. A foot forcefully pushed him back to the ground.

“I will spare your life this time, but there would definitely be no second time!” Ling Han threatened menacingly. With one foot stepping on a prodigy, he swept his eyes over the surroundings, and everyone couldn’t help but lower their head, not daring to even make eye contact with him.
