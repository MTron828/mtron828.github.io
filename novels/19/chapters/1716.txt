Chapter 1717: Plan of Two Schemers

“Hey, Little Han, why do you look like you’re about to do something bad?” a voice suddenly said.

Without turning around, Ling Han already knew that only one “person” could speak in such a contemptible tone.

The large black dog!

He smiled, and said, “What? You’ve grown tired of playing around?”

“Sigh, the people here are far too inhospitable to guests, and they’re absolutely no fun to mess around with,” the large black dog said with a sigh. He rested a paw on his chin, and his expression was one of exasperation.

Ling Han could already imagine how many people had been screwed over by this detestable dog.

“Oh, that’s right, you were wearing such an evil smile just then. You’re definitely up to no good. Hurry up and tell Grandpa Dog so I can also have some fun.” There was a bright glimmer in the large black dog’s eyes. He loved to screw people over.

Ling Han’s eyes darted around, and he said, “I’ve planned a spectacular show, and there just happens to be a position for you. Do you want it?”

An alert expression instantly spread across the large black dog’s face. He was the grandmaster of screwing people over, so he was naturally vigilant to getting screwed over as well. In fact, he always felt like others wanted to do evil toward him. “Brat, what do you want Grandpa Dog to do?”

“I want you to bite someone and lead them to a certain place,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

“Woof!” The large black dog was infuriated, and he furiously lunged at Ling Han. “You can go and bite someone! Your entire family can go and bite someone!”

This detestable dog was clearly an evil being who always ran around biting people, yet he always refused to acknowledge his own identity as such. How incredibly shameless!

Ling Han continued to dodge the large black dog’s attacks as he described his plan. Gradually, the large black dog couldn’t help but slow down and stop. There was a bright glimmer in his eyes.

“Grandpa Dog shall accept this job!” The large black dog stood up on his hind legs like a human before patting his iron underwear, and saying, “I’ll pat my chest and guarantee that I definitely won’t screw up!”

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened.

‘Is that your chest?’

“Hehe, it was a mistake, a mistake,” the large black dog said with a chuckle.

There was suspicion on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “Little Black, you’re not going to screw me over as well, are you?”

The large black dog instantly looked as if he had been insulted. He opened his mouth and was just about to bite at Ling Han, yet his expression suddenly transformed into a smile instead. “You guessed it. Grandpa Dog initially wanted you to fall into a fire pit and burn to death.”

‘This detestable dog!’

“I’m kidding. With our relationship, how can I harm you?” the large black dog said with a serious expression.

The large black dog had a history of misdeeds, so his words naturally couldn’t be trusted. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, Ling Han believed that his plan was very much to the large black dog’s tastes. Even if the large black dog wanted to screw him over, he would only do so after the plan had been successfully carried out. Otherwise, the spectacular show wouldn’t be possible.

The human and dog started to discuss the fine details of the plan. Both of them were so evil that they could even frighten themselves, and after some discussions, they refined the initial plan that was full of flaws into one that was almost flawless.

“Little Han, you’re so evil! Be careful of growing an ulcer on your head and dying early,” the large black dog said in a solemn yet nonsensical manner.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “In terms of evil, I have yet to reach one-ten thousandth of your level.”

“Naturally! Grandpa Dog is the ancestor of all evil beings, so I’m also immune to all poisons.” The large black dog didn’t feel ashamed upon hearing Ling Han’s words, but instead felt a sense of smugness.

After the large black dog left, Ling Han entered the Black Tower with the Empress.

The Ding Clan was like a dragon lair and a tiger den, so Ling Han naturally wouldn’t risk bringing the Empress over. Thus, like with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he left the Empress in the Black Tower.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was completely undistracted as she continued to cultivate every day. Not only did she have the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, but she was also cultivating in the Celestial Realm. Add to that the Reincarnation Tree, and it was only natural that her cultivation had already soared to the peak stage of the Genesis Tier.

However, advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier was still far too difficult. At this moment, she had already exhausted the inheritance power from the three Phoenix Kings. Thus, she could only rely on her own abilities if she wanted to reach the Severing Mundane Tier.

However, even prodigies like Changsun Liang needed to cultivate for at least 10,000 years in order to advance to the Severing Mundane Tier. Although the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had the Reincarnation Tree to help her, her aptitude was far too inferior. In fact, it would already be an outstanding achievement if she could reach the barrier to the Severing Mundane Tier within 10,000 years.

However, she definitely couldn’t slash heaven and earth. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to withstand the backlash, and thus would only end up killing herself. In other words, she needed to slash her own mundane relationships. That being the case, it was extremely likely that she would slash her feelings toward Ling Han.

The great dao was merciless, and if one wanted to comprehend the great dao, they naturally needed to be aloof and devoid of desires as well.

However, Ling Han didn’t want to lose a wife. As such, he desired to concoct some alchemical pill that could extend one’s lifespan without them needing to reach the Severing Mundane Tier.

Anyhow, reaching the Severing Mundane Tier was far too difficult, so it was very likely that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden wouldn’t be able to succeed. If she forcefully attempted to advance, she would only end up killing herself.

Regarding this, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also helpless. Even in the Ancient Realm, her talent could only be regarded as fairly good. The gulf between her and the top prodigies was far too huge.

Ling Han dragged his two wives over to have a threesome. The Empress didn’t mind this, but the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was so embarrassed that she couldn’t help but bite Ling Han afterward. She was easily embarrassed, and there were still many positions that they had yet to unlock. Right now, threesomes were still extremely difficult for her to accept.

“Your husband is about to venture into danger today, so aren’t you going to give me some encouragement?” Ling Han said with a hearty laugh. After dressing himself, he couldn’t help but slap the Empress’ shapely buttocks. Upon seeing them undulate, he almost gave a howl as he leaped toward her again.

After making love for a long while, Ling Han finally exited the Black Tower. The Ding Clan had said that they would open their ancestral shrine in three days and accept Ling Han into the Ding Clan there. At the same time, they would also bestow upon him the surname of Ding.

Judging from these actions, it was clear that the Ding Clan genuinely valued Ling Han. They were especially opening their ancestral shrine for him. However, whether or not they would target Ling Han during this process was another matter entirely.

“That’s their ancestral shrine!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head and chuckled. It was clear that after he went in, the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan would definitely become non-existent. At that time, what kind of expressions would the members of the Ding Clan wear?

After finishing his disguise, Ling Han smiled and left the army encampment, heading toward the Ding Clan.

After returning victorious, Ling Han and the others with outstanding achievements had all received three years of leave. During this time, they would receive their pay as usual. Thus, Ling Han was extremely free right now, and he was able to go wherever he wanted.

Ling Han finally arrived at the Ding Clan after casually strolling around for two days.

This was inevitable. After all, Dark Moon City was far too large.

The Ding Clan was bustling with activity today as the young king tier Ling Han was about to join them. Many people came over to witness this ceremony. Moreover, even up until today, the Ding Clan and the Long Clan still refused to believe that Ling Han would truly join the Ding Clan.

After all, this didn’t make sense! To say nothing of the Ding Clan’s lack of promises and benefits, even if they did give Ling Han enough benefits, their previous conflicts should have still pushed Ling Han toward the Duan Clan or the Long Clan. This was especially the case if they all promised the same benefits.

Something was wrong!

Not only the Ding Clan, but everyone else also found this to be incredibly strange. If Ling Han truly wanted to join some force, wouldn’t it be better to find one in Black Moon City?

The ceiling was higher, the stage was larger, and resources were also more abundant.

“Ling Han has arrived!” someone shouted upon seeing the man in azure robes appear before the front gate.

The protagonist of today had finally arrived. Moreover, regardless of what Ling Han was planning, they could only judge today’s events after they were over.

Once Ling Han joined the Ding Clan, there would be no turning back.
