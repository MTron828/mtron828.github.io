As long as they humiliated Ling Han and gave him no chance of retreat, would Alchemist Zi Cheng still have the face to assign him the position of Holy Son?

Would he not be afraid of the detrimental effects?

Although this would also cause Alchemist Zi Cheng to view them in a negative light, this was still better than watching Ling Han becoming a Holy Son and eventually the leader of Alchemy City. Thus, they definitely had to take this gamble.

Inside the alchemy room, Ling Han was completely undisturbed as he continued to practice alchemy. Time flew by, and it wasn’t long before another six months passed. There was a tense expression on his face as he summoned an alchemical pill toward him, unleashing a column of Nine Heavens Flame as he did so.

Boom!

The flames enveloped the alchemical pill.

He had failed to complete this step time and time again. His Nine Heavens Flame had always been too powerful, causing it to directly incinerate his alchemical pills.

After several failures, and after countless reflections, Ling Han was confident that he would definitely succeed this time.

Boom! The Nine Heavens Flame roared, and the Celestial pill unleashed a brilliant glow. It was as if all of its essence had been roused, and it was as if this essence were intertwining with the Dao of Heaven and Earth to trigger some kind of indescribable transformation.

Success!

Ling Han roared with laughter. After so much difficulty, he had finally succeeded!

Even if he cultivated for tens of thousands of years under the Reincarnation Tree, that was only cultivation in mind. His physical body would be subject to the real flow of time. In the Time Cultivation Chamber, however, things were slightly different.

Both his divine sense and his physical body would be subject to the same flow of time. In terms of real time, he had spent one and a half years to master the First Refinement. In reality, however, his mind and body had already experienced a span of 150 years!

This was a very, very long time.

Fortunately, however, he had finally succeeded!

Ling Han gazed at the Celestial pill in his hand, on which there was a faint golden line. Even among First Refinement Celestial pills, there were still clear differences. For example, the golden line on Ling Han’s Celestial pill was relatively faint in color. It was far inferior to what Grandmaster Zi Cheng could produce.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. He was still far too inexperienced. He truly couldn’t compare himself to someone like Alchemist Zi Cheng.

If Grandmaster Zi Cheng heard his laments, his beard would definitely quiver in anger.

Just how many years had he spent on alchemy? If Ling Han caught up to him in such a short time, where the hell would that place him?

Anyhow, the fact that Ling Han had already reached such a level upon his first successful Spirit Refinement was already extremely astonishing. Back then, even Grandmaster Zi Cheng hadn’t performed so well.

What else did Ling Han want?!

Ling Han exited the alchemy chamber, and returned to his own residence, only to see the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden leading two children around the courtyard.

This was a pair of troublemakers, one male and one female. They were both wearing red undergarments, and they were giggling as they ran around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Upon seeing Ling Han enter, both of them immediately shrunk behind her. They then stuck their heads out to stare at him.

They were the last two members of the Gururu Tribe.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile and say, “What, you don’t recognize me anymore?”

Although they had only been infants back then, their natural talent was far too extraordinary. Thus, they would definitely be able to remember Ling Han.

Sure enough, the two children immediately charged over after observing him for a brief moment. They hugged his legs, and shouted, “Stepfather!”

‘F*ck! When did I become your stepfather?’

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t help but smile and say, “Lei’er and Yu’er have been thinking about you every day.”

The young boy was called Shi Lei, and the young girl was called Shi Yu. This was because they had both leaped out from rocks1.

Ling Han shook his legs, yet the two children were stuck to him like bubblegum. He couldn’t shake them off no matter what. In the end, he could only say, “Let go of me first!”

“No!” the two children shouted, continuing to tightly embrace his legs.

In the end, they were only willing to let go after some persuasion from the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She carried them in her arms.

Ling Han chitchatted with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden for a while, yet they couldn’t act overly intimate, because of the presence of the two children. There was an aggrieved look in the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s eyes. Ling Han’s heart wavered, and he leaned over, and said, “I’ll visit you at night.”

“Stepmom, why is Stepdad visiting you at night?” Shi Lei asked.

“How stupid are you? Stepdad is obviously going to play intimate games with Stepmom,” Shi Yu said with a mature tone.

“Oh!” Shi Lei said with a nod. However, confusion spread across his face again, and he asked, “What do you mean by playing intimate games?”

“You don’t even know about intimate games? How stupid!” Shi Yu said with a disdainful look.

Children nowadays!

Ling Han sighed upon hearing this. He then pecked the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s red and supple lips before taking his leave.

He arrived at the fifth level, where he reported his good news to Alchemist Zi Cheng.

“You’ve succeeded?” Alchemist Zi Cheng asked with an excited expression.

Even though Ling Han had taken six months longer than his requirement, this was still an incredible feat. At the very least, it was better than what he had achieved in the past.

Ling Han nodded, and he handed the alchemical pill to Alchemist Zi Cheng. “Please take a look, Master.”

Alchemist Zi Cheng accepted the Celestial Pill, and he instantly shuddered upon laying eyes on it.

“This is the product of your first successful Spirit Refinement?” he asked.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “It’s far inferior to what Master can produce. I’ve let Master down.”

He was slightly embarrassed, and he was truly feeling guilty.

Alchemist Zi Cheng wore a strange expression, and after a long time, he finally said, “Mm-hm, it’s good that you know you’re lacking. Although you’re talented, you definitely can’t become conceited or arrogant. Only by doing so will you have a chance to climb to the pinnacle of alchemy.”

“Mm-hm!” Ling Han nodded in understanding, and he humbly accepted his master’s teachings.

Upon seeing Ling Han’s slightly disappointed expression, Alchemist Zi Cheng almost couldn’t help but shout, “You’re a motherf*cking genius!”

Although Ling Han’s performance was indeed inferior to his, just who was he? He was a Four-Star Alchemist! Moreover, he had already mastered the Seventh Refinement!

If Ling Han could rival him already, would there still be any reason left in this heaven and earth?

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was simply afraid that Ling Han would become too conceited if he spoke the truth. However, since Ling Han felt that he wasn’t skilled enough, why not play along with him? However, upon seeing Ling Han’s expression of disappointment, he couldn’t help but feel extremely vexed.

This was vexing, far too f*cking vexing!

As it turned out, taking such a supremely talented disciple also came with such kinds of headaches!

Of course, in Alchemist Zi Cheng’s eyes, these headaches were a joyful blessing. It would be great if Ling Han were even more talented, and if he gave him even more “headaches”.

“In 10 days, you’ll be officially granted the title of Holy Son. However, this is also a test. At that time, anyone can step forward to challenge your understanding of alchemy. It’s extremely likely that you’ll also have to refine alchemical pills on the spot. Rest well these few days, and make sure you’re fully prepared,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “I understand.”

Anyhow, he had already been separated from his wife for so long, so now was a good time for some exercise.

“Alright, you can go now,” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a wave of his hand.

Ling Han left the mansion, and a wide smile immediately spread across Alchemist Zi Cheng’s face. This smile grew larger, and he eventually couldn’t help but roar with laughter. His boisterous laughter astonished countless surrounding birds.

‘Incredible, far too incredible! This feels even more amazing than earning one trillion Star Stones!’

Alchemist Zi Cheng was genuinely satisfied with this disciple. However, for the sake of Ling Han’s future, it was a shame that he had to suppress his true emotions before him. He couldn’t praise Ling Han too much. This left him feeling slightly regretful. However, once Ling Han became a Holy Son, his brilliance would be clear for all to see. He would become the most dazzling star in the Alchemy City.

“With such a brilliant disciple, what else can I ask for?” Alchemist Zi Cheng said with a sigh of emotion. He felt as delighted as could be.
