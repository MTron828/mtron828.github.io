Chapter 1792: Sudden and unexpected disaster

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. His wife and Small Tower were actually encouraging him to court a girl. This was really too bizarre.

No way, he was absolutely determined not to go along with it!

“Yo, what a beautiful girl!” Shua, a black figure flashed past. A large black dog appeared on the ship’s deck, wearing a pair of flashing silvery iron underwear. It stood on its hind legs, blowing a wolf whistle in the direction of Zihe Bingyun.

Ling Han suddenly felt an urge to facepalm. This large black dog was really a haunting spirit that could not be gotten rid of. Wherever he went, this large black dog would be there.

Forget it, he’d just act like he didn’t know it.

“Isn’t this Little Han!” But this large black dog still waved its dog’s paw at Little Han, and then turned to look at Zihe Bingyun. “Girlie, come give Grandpa Dog a smile!”

Zihe Bingyun’s eyes widened slightly, but in the next instant, her figure vanished from where she had been standing. Furthermore, it was not an instant disappearance, but rather she faded little by little into nothing.

That was because the speed of her movement was too fast, so she had left behind afterimages where she had originally been standing.

Shua, she appeared in front of the large black dog, and delivered a palm strike straight at this despicable dog.

“Girlie, you are so nice to want to give your Grandpa Dog a massage?” The large black dog was still as utterly despicable as he had always been. “Too bad, your hands and feet are so rough that Grandpa Dog fears that I will be pummeled to death, so just forget it.”

Its figure also flashed. Peng, Zihe Bingyun’s palm strike hit, yet completely missed its target.

‘Hmm?’

Luo Changfeng involuntarily showed a hint of shock in his expression. Others might not know, but how could it be that he, too, would be ignorant? Zihe Bingyun’s strength was in no way inferior to his, and the two of them had actually just concluded a top-grade sparring competition, and just happened to be heading the same way, and had thus traveled together.

And Zihe Bingyun was a Space Element Divine Fetus. Merely in terms of speed, she was slightly superior to him, but with her having taken the initiative to attack, she had actually missed a large black dog that was the target of her blow. How could this not render him dumbstruck?

“Keke, Grandpa Dog is over here!” The large black dog appeared at a corner of the ship’s deck, his back turned on Zihe Bingyun as he was shaking his behind in a very showy manner. To say nothing of Zihe Bingyun who was quite infuriated, even Ling Han felt an urge to rush forwards and give it a kick.

Zihe Bingyun set off in pursuit, but the large black dog continued to tear a hole in space, and escaped very easily.

“Aiya, the little girl looks quite pretty, but why are you so fierce? Forget it, Grandpa Dog doesn’t want you as my steed anymore! Little Han, Grandpa Dog will bestow this fierce woman on you, so give her proper instruction.” When the large black dog had said these words, he ran off without a second thought.

Zihe Bingyun chased after him, but in the aspect of escaping, Ling Han had not found anyone that could surpass the large black dog, at least not among those in the same cultivation level. True enough, Zihe Bingyun returned with a livid expression after a while, though her pretty eyes were set firmly on Ling Han.

That damn dog!

Ling Han sighed internally. The large black dog had definitely done it on purpose, drawing the heat onto him.

He really was the type to screw others over.

“Anyone would be in the right to kill this despicable dog!” Ling Han immediately made his stand clear. He had no wish to fight with anyone for no reason. Furthermore, he had been screwed over by the large black dog, so he was also extremely displeased, and very much wanted to kick him.

“Since you are familiar with that despicable dog, then I will capture you first, and force that despicable dog to come out!” Zihe Bingyun declared coldly. Without waiting for Ling Han to answer, she immediately made her move.

‘F***, can’t you listen to reason?’

Ling Han used Lightning Flash, and he managed to dodge Zihe Bingyun’s attack with a flash of his figure. His temper was also stoked, and he exclaimed, “Miss, don’t be such an intolerable bully!”

“So what if I am?” Zihe Bingyun declared proudly, and brazenly followed her strike with another attack. She was determined to capture Ling Han at all costs.

“You unreasonable shrew, you should seek out whoever angered you. Do you think that I am an easy target to bully?” Ling Han was angered, and used celestial techniques as he began to counterattack. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zihe Bingyun was so angry her delicate body was trembling with fury. She was one of the heirs of the Zihe Clan, and had been pampered since childhood. She was a princess that had been born with a silver spoon in her mouth. To say nothing of being called a shrew, no one had even directed any kind of harsh words at her.

But first there was the large black dog, and next was Ling Han. They were both characters that could drive others to irrepressible fury with mere words alone, and Zihe Bingyun flew into a thunderous fury.

She drew a long sword, her killing intent blazing.

Ling Han was unafraid, and as the Divine Demon Sword was used, Sword Qi shot directly into the Nine Heavens.

This...!

Everyone was staring in shock, dumbfounded. Ling Han’s style of battle was incredibly fierce. It was clear that his battle prowess was inferior to the opponent’s, but he would always be attacking head-on, and what was shocking was the fact that though Zihe Bingyun sent him sliding backwards repeatedly with attacks, he was still completely unscathed.

‘Just what exactly is the level of your defense!’

Everyone had incredibly good insight, and could accurately make their own judgement. In terms of battle prowess, Zihe Bingyun was slightly stronger. After all, she was a third severance elite, but Ling Han’s defenses was freakishly strong, which rendered Zihe Bingyun’s powerful offensive completely ineffective.

“Damn it!” Zihe Bingyun cried out, and a transparent battle spear actually appeared in her left hand. Shua, she summoned it with a wave of her hand, and it shot out towards Ling Han.

Pa, pa, pa. As the battle spear shot out, it was actually traversing space. It had just been flying rapidly moments ago, but in a mere instant, it had already appeared in front of Ling Han, aimed in a direct stab at his head.

She really was incredibly cruel!

Ling Han’s eyes became cold. Just because the large black dog had greeted him, and said a few words, this woman was actually venting all her hatred and fury on him. Just how unreasonable could she be?

‘Just because you came from a Celestial King Tier clan, and are the heir, you can be as willful as you like?’

Ling Han stretched out a hand. Pa, he grabbed the battle spar. This thing was really too fast. Even if he used Lightning Flash, he would not be able to throw it off his tail.

Ka, ka, ka. Cold ice formed, and this transparent battle spear was frozen solid, pushing Ling Han backwards such that he slid back at least 300 meters, and only stopped when he was forced back against the doors to the ship’s hold.

But the force of the battle spear was not expended fully yet. It twisted Ling Han’s arm, and the tip of the spear stabbed into his chest, creating a groove from the force, and only then did all its power finally disperse.

Ling Han’s physique was really too tough. Even this kind of impact was unable to penetrate his skin, and could only create a small groove in his body.

Zihe Bingyun’s beautiful face had a drastic change in expression. This strike was not an ordinary blow. It was created by her using the power of her Ethereal Divine Fetus, but even so, it was unable to harm Ling Han in the slightest, and this was something she could not accept.

Could it be that the other party was also a Divine Fetus, but not one that was focused on offensive, but leaned more in the direction of defenses? For example, something like Chaos Element Rock Divine Fetus.

Additionally, how had he managed to grab her battle spear?

That was a battle spear that had been formed through the Ethereal Divine Fetus, and could not be touched by any celestial technique!

Why was it said that Regulations of Space and Time were frightening? That was because they were much stronger than other Regulations before attaining Celestial King Tier. For example, this battle spear was definitely not something that a Severing Mundane Tier could touch. This involved a very high grade of Space Regulations.

This was also why Divine Fetus was terrifying. That was because a Divine Fetus could draw on Regulations that exceeded their own cultivation level.

Faced with this strike from her, a Severing Mundane Tier could only think of some way to take the strike head-on, and depend on his defenses to survive this blow, or choose to fight attack with attack.

Yet Ling Han had actually grabbed the battle spear with Water Element Regulations!

Impossible, even if Ling Han was a Water Element Divine Fetus, Space Regulations would overwhelm all the Five Elements before Celestial King Tier. How could Ling Han have possibly managed to touch her Ethereal Battle Spear?

Strange, incredibly strange. This guy was covered completely in a shroud of strangeness.
