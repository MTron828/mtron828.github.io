3150 Ten Meridians

The Volcanic Fruit’s medicinal effects took effect.

Ling Han guided the effects, circulating it within his body.

Boom! His ninth meridian was rapidly widening at an extremely intense pace.

Logically speaking, this Volcanic Fruit should have been taken when at the peak stage of Nine Meridians. In this way, the powerful medicinal effects could be used to open up the next meridian. Otherwise, because this step was the most difficult, it was very likely that as the medicinal effects took effect, the subsequent effects would no longer be enough to open up the tenth meridian.

Ling Han didn’t care about this. All he wanted was to break through to the peak stage of Nine Meridians.Even if the medicinal effects were exhausted, and he was still unable to break through to Ten Meridians, he would only have to wait until the next morning to cultivate again. He would definitely be able to push open the doors to the Ten Meridians then.

He was filled with confidence about this.

His ninth meridian was rapidly expanding. This had long since been opened, but it was still far from widening to the extreme.

The medicinal effects were so fierce.

Ling Han thought internally. At present, it was as if there was a primitive beast hidden in his body, that was endlessly barraging him, making him feel as if his body was about to explode.

However, the fiercer the medicinal effects, the faster his cultivation level would increase. Under the repeated impact, his ninth meridian quickly expanded to the extreme, giving rise to a powerful pain.

It’s done, he thought to himself, and began to grope around for the tenth meridian.

The power in Ling Han’s body was a tentacle, but this power was too violent and not gentle, causing Ling Han to be very injured, coughing up blood continuously.

Thankfully, not even a minute had passed, and Ling Han had already found the tenth meridian. Boom, his power had a new vent, and immediately surged in, incredibly violently.

Come! Come!

Ling Han was as steady as a boulder, absorbing this energy and guiding it towards the tenth meridian.

Boom, the tenth meridian was forcibly opened up. This was Hand Yangming Large Intestine Meridian, and it started from the index finger of the left hand, and finally ended below the left eye.

It wasn’t enough that it had been opened. The medicinal effects of the Volcanic Fruit hadn’t completely dissipated yet, and after several more attempts, it finally came to an end.

Ling Han stood up, filled with anticipation.

He was now a Ten Meridians, and could release his power.

With a thought, power surged in all ten meridians, converging and fusing, forming some kind of qualitative change that could not be described with words. Ling Han raised his right hand, and pressed it forwards. Pu, a lamp placed on the table immediately collapsed.

Success!

Ling Han smiled faintly. However, he didn’t dare to use too much strength in the room, so he walked out.

There was a combat chamber on the bottom floor of the ship, and there was a strength tester inside. He had long since found out about this.

He arrived, only to see five men sparring. The youngest was only 20 years old, while the oldest was around 30 years old. They were all Ten Meridians.

When they saw Ling Han, two younger men immediately nodded at Ling Han, and said, “Deputy Captain Ling.”

The other three men were much more arrogant, and acted like they did not see him.

…Ling Han was suddenly appointed as deputy captain by Lian Xuerong. This naturally made a great many veteran team members displeased. What right did a Nine Meridians have to surpass and rule over them?

They didn’t dare to protest to Lian Xuerong. However, there was no way they would show Ling Han any respect either. In fact, they were filled with animosity toward him.

Ling Han smiled and nodded at the two people who had greeted him. As for the other three, he had no plans to pay them any attention for the moment. He only had to show off his abilities, and what problem would not be dealt with?

Seeing that Ling Han did not make any move, and merely walked past them, the three soldiers with heavy animosity instantly looked disdainful.

Che, he was just a coward. He did not even dare to show a temper in the face of such provocation, so how could he be worthy of being their deputy captain?

“I really am unconvinced. A mere Nine Meridians can actually become our deputy captain. It should be known that the lowest requirement for entering into the Xuanqing Banner is Ten Meridians. What kind of bootlicking has this brat done to the Banner Lord?”

“Hehe, wouldn’t you know after challenging him?”

“That’s true. If we beat him up, this brat should retreat in the face of difficulties, and ask for his own resignation from the Banner Lord.”

“Which of our captains didn’t obtain their positions with the force of their fists?”

“Yi, this guy wants to test his strength?”

“We’ll wait for him to finish testing his strength, and then seek him out for a challenge.”

The five of them stopped sparring and walked over.

Ling Han arrived in front of the strength tested. He stood three feet away from it. Ordinarily, this was the greatest attack range of a Ten Meridians king tier. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

All right, come.

He did not channel any kind of technique, and merely shot out a punch.

Peng! His fist clearly hadn’t landed on the strength testing device, yet the surging power of the punch still surged forward and slammed into it.

On the strength tester, the numbers flashed continuously, and finally stopped.

“F*ck!”

“F***, my eyes must have blurred!”

“How is this possible?!”

“F*** you!”

On the strength tester, the number “45,500kg” was extremely eye-catching.

A Ten Meridians’ limit was only 25,000kg of strength, while a Eleven Meridians’ limit was also 35,000kg. There were indeed prodigies who could break through this limit, but a Ten Meridians’ highest record was 30,000kg of strength, while an Eleven Meridians’ highest record was 40,000kg.

45,500kg of strength. This was almost reaching the limit of Twelve Meridians.

Ling Han must have broken through. Otherwise, he would not have been able to release his power. This was the effect of the Volcanic Fruit. However, Ling Han should have just broken through, and thus possessed power that was close to the limit of Twelve Meridians.

How could this be believed?

“Hey, didn’t you say you wanted to challenge this new deputy captain?” Someone nudged the soldier who had previously said he wanted to challenge Ling Han.

The soldier grimaced upon hearing this. How he wished he could dig a hole and bury himself in it.

Though he was also a Ten Meridians, his power was only 25,000 kilograms. Compared to Ling Han, this gap was close to double. The only result of challenging him would be seeking his own humiliation.

It should be known that in front of absolute power, any kind of technique was completely useless.

“What a monster.”

“A super monster!”

“To say nothing of becoming a deputy captain, it would not be strange for such a monster to become a captain even.”

The five of them were completely impressed. He was already so strong at Ten Meridians, then what about when he advanced to Eleven Meridians?

No, no, no. As long as he reached the peak stage of Ten Meridians, his power would probably exceed 50,000kg of force. Aside from the distance he could release his force, he would not be inferior to any Twelve Meridians.

Ling Han hesitated for a moment. He discovered that the distance of three feet was not the limit of his power. He took a few more steps back, and stood six feet away, preparing to throw a punch.

“Yi, what does he want to do?”

“Punch from six feet away?”

“A Ten Meridians’ power can reach ten feet at most, but at this distance, the power is almost zero. It’s no different from the force of a breeze.”

“What does our new deputy captain want to do?”

The five warriors were all curious.

Right at this moment, Ling Han shot out a punch. Peng! The strength tester instantly started operating again.

“4-46,000kg!”

“Heavens, what is going on here? Not only has his power not weakened, it has instead strengthened?”

“Without channelling any techniques, power will indeed fluctuate, but when a Ten Meridians throws a punch from six feet away, his power doesn’t decrease at all?”

“Am I dreaming?”

“Freak, without a doubt, this guy is a freak!”

The five warriors all looked at Ling Han with reverence. Was this really a human?
