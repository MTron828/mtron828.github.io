Chapter 802: Flea King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

True Dragon’s Blood Stone was formed from the irrigation of an alternative dragon’s blood essence, so a blood stone the size of a fist was comparable to a three-leafed Dragon’s Blood Grass, and such a large chunk like the one before their eyes... was absolutely shocking.

Thus, Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue both gasped in astonishment, having a sense of unbelievable surprise.

However, this large flea was in the Shattering Void Tier, emitting a terrifying oppressive sensation just lying there in the distance, and approaching slightly closer, Ling Han’s and Helian Xun Xue’s skin was about to crack.

Their physiques were the level of ninth-tier rare metal, yet they couldn’t even get close, serving to show the powerfulness of the great flea.

Shattering Void Tier ten stars, twelve stars, or even thirteen stars of battle prowess?

Ling Han had a feeling inside that this flee roughly reached the level of the Fifteen-eyed Corpse King, and could compare to that great silver spider in Fire Country’s ancient mineshaft. It would be useless even if he unleashed the Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation as it would be instantly destroyed.

What to do?

The treasure was before their eyes, yet they could only stare blankly at it?

“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Hu Niu pulled on Ling Han’s hand and started to walk forward. She really was young, completely not knowing what fear was.

Ling Han held her back, and said, “We can’t, the presence in front is too powerful; we can’t endure it, and we’ll explode immediately.” Originally, Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation could be used to pull aggro 1 , but this large guy was too powerful, and annihilating the ice dragon and turning its head would only be the matter of an instant.

“But Niu’s not afraid!” Hu Niu said, skipping and jumping about.

The little girl’s talents were unusual—she was unafraid of the coercive pressure, and even poison, fire, ice, and whatnot were ineffective against her. Previously, she even rushed through Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire’s path of five senses blockade. But the problem was, she didn’t have the Black Tower, so how would she collect such a large blood stone?

Moreover, the Black Tower was as small as a mustard seed, and couldn’t be brought with Hu Niu, or else she couldn’t sneak closer and then have Ling Han suddenly appear to snatch the True Dragon’s Blood Stone immediately, then hide back in.

“Niu will draw it away!” Hu Niu volunteered.

Ling Han shook his head, “No, that can at least rival the Ffteen-eyed Corpse King, being probably the most powerful being in Ghostly Dragon Cave, so that’s why it’s guarding over such a large True Dragon’s Blood Stone. You can’t outrun it.”

“Don’t underestimate Niu!” Hu Niu was unconvinced. With her hands on her hips, she said, “Niu’s speed is the fastest!”

Zi , her body turned into lightning, and in a flash, she appeared far in the distance, and with another flash, she appeared at an even further place.

Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue revealed shocked expressions at the same time. Such high speed... even they felt too inferior to bear comparison. The corners of their mouths twitched—everyone learned the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven, but why was there that much of a difference in speed?

“Niu’s a genius!” Hu Niu returned within a flash, walking on airs.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Your speed really can compare to Shattering Void Tier elites’, even being that much faster!”

“Then Niu’s going!” Hu Niu wasn’t afraid of that Flea King at all.

Ling Han thought over it again, and said, “After you steer clear of that large guy, we’ll meet up five thousand meters ahead from here.”

“Okay!” Hu Niu answered crisply, and shot out with a xiu , stopping in front of the Flea King. She said in a loud voice, “Stinky guy, come catch Niu!”

The Flea King simply looked at her casually, and then retracted its gaze as if it were sleeping soundly, too lazy to to pay attention to this ant.

Hu Niu was furious—to dare ignore someone so cute like her...

She picked up a crimson rock and covered her small body completely. She let out a loud roar, and zi , the rock was immediately bound with lightning. Xiu , this rock shot rapidly like a cannonball towards the Flea King.

Pa!

Before the rock hit, the Flea King’s terrifying aura shattered the rock—after reaching such a height, even a sliver of aura could shatter stars.

However, the large guy was finally infuriated, and couldn’t help but lift its body, glaring towards Hu Niu. It immediately discovered gloomily that the ant was exactly at the distance where its attack would weaken, and releasing an attack wouldn’t be fatal.

It was extremely lazy, and immediately lay to sleep. It was just an ant anyway, it couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to it.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, Hu Niu threw rocks in rapid succession. The Flea King lifting its aura could shatter the rocks, but there was also the power of lightning created by the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven in them, so even the Flea King felt its body become somewhat numb.

This was far from being able to hurt it, yet it made it very, very out of sorts.

Finally, after Hu Niu threw over a dozen rocks, the Flea King was in a towering rage.

This King doesn’t unleash own might, and you really think you can act rampantly on top of This Flea’s head?

He roared explosively, and the sound waves turned into ripples that spread towards the surroundings. Pa, pa, pa, pa, the rocks in the surroundings were all shattered, an extremely terrifying thing.

“Hahahaha, want to hurt Niu? Big stinky bug, you’re far from it!” Hu Niu made a face and immediately leapt away.

The Flea King finally rose up and charged towards Hu Niu.

Ling Han immediately charged towards the True Dragon’s Blood Stone, but once he moved, he discovered that the Flea King had entrenched itself here for a long time, and its Shattering Void Tier aura was almost corporeal. He immediately felt that the air was like sabers as he moved, tearing open his skin.

“Ling Han!” Helian Xun Xue hurriedly held onto him.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You head in the Black Tower first, I’ll go alone.”

“But...” Helian Xun Xue was obviously worried.

“Time to breastfeed our son, you flat chest!” Ling Han grabbed Helian Xun Xue and shoved her into the Black Tower.

He unleashed the Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation. It obviously couldn’t resist against the Flea King, but to contend against the aura that the Flea King had left was not a problem. Everyone was in the Shattering Void Tier—though there was a gap, it wasn’t large to that degree.

The dragon appeared, settling in the sky above Ling Han. He brought the formation forward, but immediately discovered that the formation was to no avail in negating the Shattering Void Tier’s aura.

F***! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han could only store away the formation’s eyes and walk forward alone.Pa, pa, pa, his skin immediately burst with blood, and his blood vessels were also crushed under such pressure. He hurriedly operated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and under the blessing of this ancient and miraculous art, his condition instantly became a lot better.

However, he still had to continue forward, and the aura in front was even more terrifying. After walking for another stretch, his bones resounded as if they were breaking.

This is a good test! Ling Han said inwardly.

He was most adept in turning tribulations into fortuitous encounters... Under such immense pressure, the Sword Heart that he was a sliver away from might be able to break out of its cocoon.

Sword Heart was of the Shattering Void Tier level, and if he could cultivate out Sword Heart, it would be easy to resist against Shattering Void Tier aura.

He advanced resolutely step by step, with blood bursting all over his body, but his gaze became brighter and brighter as something in his body was in the process of being born.
