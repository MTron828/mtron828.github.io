Chapter 704: A Strange Medicine Treasure

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

Fortunately, this green eagle didn’t care about them, the nobodies, and fluttered its wings as it flew by. In its claws, a golden rhinoceros the size of a small mountain hung with its body in tatters, bleeding all the way.

This Eight Treasures Gold Rhinoceros was in the Heaven Tier!

The golden rhinoceros’s blood sprayed down, an absolute calamity for the living spirits below. The blood contained a Heaven Tier beast’s baleful Qi, and even Deity Transformation Tier elites would be shocked to death when coming in contact with it.

Such blood was precious medicine, but at least over ten Deity Transformation Tier elites cooperating were needed to remove the baleful Qi to collect it.

No matter whether it was Yao Hui Yue, Jia Ming, or Xu Xiu Ran, when encountering such a situation, they could basically do nothing but shake their heads and make a detour. But it was different for Ling Han, for he had the Heaven Transformation Bowl.

This treasure was unleashed, and it collected the golden rhinoceros’s blood, directly extracting the purest of essence. The medicinal effects would be stronger, yet without the baleful Qi.

However, no one would dare consume such a precious liquid; even if it wasn’t at the Shattering Void Tier, it was still in high-level Heaven Tier, and with their current cultivation, whoever ate it would explode.

“Even a Shattering Void Tier beast has appeared,” they exclaimed.

This is a female eagle, and might have just given birth to a convocation of small eagles. If one could be raised, then it’ll be awe-inspiring in the future,” the rabbit suddenly said.

Everyone was visibly moved. The tier of beasts depended more on bloodline, and this green eagle had reached the Shattering Void Tier, so its offspring could also reach Shattering Void Tier as long it was provided with sufficient “nutrition.”

This was the greatest difference between humans and beasts, but in contrast, beasts were also limited by bloodline. If this green eagle wanted to cross over Shattering Void Tier and advance into the divine realm, it would be something almost impossible.

... Unless it could receive supreme precious medicine and shatter the constraints of bloodline.

This was too distant, but raising a Shattering Void Tier beast, just how shocking would its value be?

“Grilled eagle legs!” Hu Niu’s thoughts were obviously offbeat as her eyes started to light up.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Don’t indulge in flights of fancy. A Shattering Void Tier beast’s nest is filled with that green eagle’s baleful Qi, and if we were to go in, we’d be turned into fine dust before seeing the eggs.”

Hearing him say so, everyone also shook their heads. Right, that was an existence of the Shattering Void Tier, so who could sneak into its nest?

“Let’s go!” They continued onwards. After two more days, Rock Spirit completely refined the heart of stone and advanced into the Spiritual Infant Tier, and it was also high-level Spiritual Infant Tier.

This type of worldly spirit was strong to begin with, and it was difficult for it to find rivals in the same tier, being a king amongst kings. With its current battle prowess, it could even rival freaks like Yao Hui Yue.

Ling Han was extremely pleased. Now, the Rock Spirit was finally a qualified hatchet man again, while Black Tower could also produce one rare stone every month, so the Rock Spirit’s speed of improvement should surpass his, becoming more and more gelivable.

At this time, the expansive area finally reached an end, and an extremely vast watery area appeared in front; at least, Ling Han couldn’t see its end even with the Eye of Truth activated.

At the junction of land and water, there was a strange medicinal plant growing. It was fifteen meters tall and entirely white, with fruit like a corn cob, but many times larger. That fruit emitted a faint aroma that made people who smelled it relaxed and happy.

However, Ling Han’s party wasn’t the only one that discovered this precious medicine. Many more people discovered it—like Jia Ming, who stood on the side with his hands behind his back and wore a beast-like grim smile.

Ling Han also saw Yao Hui Yue, who was also alone. There was also the Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing—they each brought their own team; an adventure like this was the best to foster friendship, and of course the best to destroy it.

Yuan Cheng He was also present. He gave Ling Han a slight nod and evidently honored his promise to respect Ling Han as the boss.

What was this precious medicine?

Ling Han raised such doubts. He was the Alchemy Emperor in his former life, and when it came to recognizing spirit medicine, no one would dare say they were first if he said he was second. As for many precious medicines that were already extinct, he’d also seen their appearances in graphical archives.

However, he’d never seen nor heard of such a precious medicine.

Now, everyone was restraining each other, so a fierce battle didn’t unfold. Besides, the precious medicine seemed to be a few days from reaching maturity, which made everyone refrain from clashing fiercely.

Ling Han felt it strange. This indeed was a fine precious medicine, the aroma of which proved that it definitely was a top-tier treasure, but why didn’t the Flame King and the elites of the five great sects collect it earlier in passing?

It would be worth it even if one person stayed behind to guard it here.

Was there a reason?

Ling Han revealed a contemplative look. In his former life, he entered too many historical sites and encountered many dangers, giving him a clear awareness—never become obsessed with treasures.

Treasures were admittedly good, but they were often associated with danger and traps.

There were clearly many powerful beasts entrenched here, yet with a precious medicine placed there openly, why wasn’t there a single beast that guarded it?

A precious medicine of heaven and earth would often be accompanied by beasts and even emerge because of beasts.

Intuition made Ling Han firmly believe that there was a very highly probability that this would be a trap.

He told Rain Emperor and Mu Rong Qing of this suspicion, and called Yuan Cheng He to his side, making him obey his command. Yuan Cheng He was somewhat unwilling, but he didn’t dare to disobey.

... This fierce person was the one who killed Small Saber King!

Everyone was still waiting, waiting for the moment the precious medicine truly matured, which was the matter of two to three days. Many more people came arrived afterwards. Amongst them was no lack of Heaven Tier elites, which made the weaker people sigh. If they’d known elites of this level would appear, they definitely wouldn’t have waited so long and just grabbed the precious medicine earlier; even if it wasn’t ripe, it was better than nothing.

Three days later, there were as many as seven Heaven Tier elites, and Ling Han’s anxiousness grew greater, because over these few days, he hadn’t seen a single beast nearby.

One should know that beasts had an extremely strong sense of territory. There were no beasts here, which meant only one thing... there was already a powerful beast here, which made the other beasts view this area as a forbidden land, not daring to set foot on it.

Contest for the precious medicine finally started. Seven Heaven Tier elites battled fiercely, and the powerful aftereffect of the battle made everyone retreat constantly, unable to get close.

At this moment, the precious medicine disappeared with a tremble.

Everyone was dumbfounded. This precious medicine grew feet? Or, was it someone daring and bold who took advantage to steal the precious medicine while the seven Heaven Tier elites were fighting fiercely?

Hong, long, long, the earth began to quake. Pa , a fissure appeared, and then spiderweb-like cracks spread in all directions as if some terrifying existence was about to break through the ground.
