Chapter 1212: Hu Niu is Angry

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She was a young girl, and she looked to be around 15 or 16 years old. Her eyes were bright, and her teeth were white—her beauty was indescribably refreshing. Anyone who saw her would be moved by her demeanor. She would be imprinted in their minds and their bones.

However, such a girl had uncannily descended from the sky. In fact, no one had seen how she had appeared. Yet, she had ruthlessly trampled Yang Hao into the ground. They couldn’t help but pity Yang Hao—was he a magnet for suffering?

‘This girl... is remarkably powerful!’

Meanwhile, Ling Han hesitated for a moment before subconsciously asking, “Hu Niu?”

Apart from her, who else referred to themself as Niu?

“Ling Han!” The young girl instantly dashed over.

Peng!

She dove into his arms, and she wrapped her legs around his waist. She was especially tall and slender to begin with, so her method of hugging made her a head taller than Ling Han. Ling Han’s head was tightly pressed into her chest.

Although she was only 15 or 16, her chest was already starting to develop. In fact, there was still a lot of room for growth. One could imagine just how shapely and full it would become in the future.

“Niu’s missed you so much!” the young girl exclaimed.

“Hu Niu! It’s really you, Hu Niu!” Ling Han was over the moon with delight. The Roc Palace was still the same as before—just as they had suddenly appeared before, they suddenly appeared now.

“Huh? Ling Han, you’re wounded!” Hu Niu realized that something was off. A murderous aura burst from her body, and she immediately scanned the surroundings. She looked at Venerable Trinity, and shouted, “Old geezer, was it you that wounded Niu’s Ling Han?”

“Heh!” Venerable Trinity replied with an indifferent chuckle. Who was he? He was the most powerful elite in this galaxy! So, why would he argue with a young girl? Though, this young girl did seem a little uncanny.

However, even though he ignored them, there was no way that people who insulted an Eternal River Tier elite could get off so easily.

The others would deal with them for him.

Gao Fang immediately stepped forward, and chided, “How impudent! How dare you disrespect our venerable master!”

However, he didn’t dare underestimate Hu Niu even though he scolded her. Although she looked very young, she had displayed her strength by trampling Yang Hao into the ground.

Who was Yang Hao?

He was a prodigy among prodigies, and he was more so at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Even though he had already been injured, one would still need to be at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier to crush him into the earth. In fact, they might need to be at the Heavenly Body Tier!

If this young girl were at the Heavenly Body Tier—which Gao Fang didn’t believe to be the case—he would need to be very careful.

“Humph! If Niu’s Ling Han was wounded by that old geezer, I’ll rip him to shreds!” Hu Niu said angrily. “Even if it wasn’t him, he’s still clearly the most powerful person here. Yet, he allowed the culprit to wound Niu’s Ling Han. So, Niu is still going to smash him into pieces! His actions are far too detestable!”

“Hu Niu, let go! You’re about to squish me to death!” Ling Han shouted. His face was buried in Hu Niu’s chest, and he was suffocating to death.

“Heehee!” Hu Niu giggled as she climbed off his body like a monkey. She then glowered at the others, and said, “These are all bad people! Niu is going to exterminate them in the name of the moon!”

“Hahaha!” Many of them burst out laughing. What a naive little girl! This was the Majestic Heaven Sect, a sect that was guarded by the number one elite in the world! Even True Dragons would have to lie low if they came!

In the minds of the disciples, Venerable Trinity was the strongest being in the world. This wasn’t their fault, as such kind of beliefs was determined by the overall level of cultivation of a galaxy. Who could envisage a Genesis Tier Saint appearing here?

“Father, let me deal with her!” Gao Huang said as he leaped over. There was a strong sense of lust in his eyes as he stared at Hu Niu. This girl was innocent and charming, and her beauty was enough to entrance one’s soul. He was going to take this opportunity to make her his concubine!

Hua Yangwen humphed upon hearing this. He had been enraptured by Hu Niu’s beauty, and this had caused his reaction to become slower. As such, the opportunity was stolen by Gao Huang.

Gao Fang pondered over this. His son was at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and he was more so a four-star genius. He was far more powerful than Yang Hao. As such, he wouldn’t necessarily lose to this young girl.

Could such a young girl possibly be at the Heavenly Body Tier? Impossible! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Fine!” he said with a nod. “Don’t be careless!”

The young girl had knocked Yang Hao out with a single stamp, so she was definitely among the top echelon of Sun Moon Tier elites.

“Understood!” Gao Huang replied. He stepped forward, and said, “Little girl, I’ll give you a chance seeing as you’re so young and naive. Hurry up, kowtow and apologize to Master. Master is benevolent, so perhaps he’ll spare your life.”

He had to receive permission from Venerable Trinity if he wanted to take this enchanting young girl as his concubine. Otherwise, he would be seeking death!

Hu Niu turned to Ling Han, and said, “This person is a bad person! Ling Han, can I pummel him?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Of course!”

He placed a finger on Hu Niu’s forehead and used his divine sense to transfer the events from before. This piece of memory was very short, so it naturally wouldn’t have any detrimental effects on Hu Niu.

Hu Niu shut her eyes and then reopened them. A violent aura instantly burst from her body.

Hu!

Even the surrounding air was affected by her aura, and it transformed into countless blades that pointed at Gao Huang.

“Sh*t!” Gao Fang’s expression changed drastically. This power was far too terrifying, and even he was gripped by a feeling apprehension. He frantically attacked the blades, hoping to save his son.

“You actually dared to insult Niu’s Ling Han! Die!” Hu Niu extended her hand forward.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

The blades instantly ripped through Gao Huang’s body, turning him into a human “beehive”.

“Aaah!” Gao Huang wailed in agony. However, he wasn’t killed by his grievous wounds.

Hu Niu had definitely left him alive on purpose. She had been vicious from a young age, and this hadn’t changed with time.

Gao Fang was both enraged and shocked. He had already stepped in, yet he still hadn’t been able to save his son. Just how powerful was this young girl?

“And you!” There was a menacing look in Hu Niu’s eyes as she pointed at Hua Yangwen.

Boom!

An air of Primal Chaos descended, forming into a boundless universe.

Pu!

Hua Yangwen instantly vomited blood. Even though he was at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, he was unable to withstand even a single glance from Hu Niu. This wasn’t the most terrifying thing. The most terrifying thing was the pieces of flesh that came out with the blood that he vomited—these were pieces of his obliterated organs.

She had merely glanced and pointed at him. There hadn’t been any Origin Power fluctuations, and there hadn’t been any intertwining Regulations, yet the organs of Hua Yangwen—a prodigy at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier—had been obliterated just like that. How terrifying was this?

“Damn it!” Gao Huang and Hua Yongning both charged forward to attack Hu Niu.

Although they were unwilling to believe it, Hu Niu’s abilities proved that she was a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Otherwise, how could she have severely wounded a Sun Moon Tier elite with a single glance?

“You two also dare to bully Niu’s Ling Han? Humph!” Hu Niu made a pressing motion, and the heads of Gao Huang and Hua Yongning instantly exploded with two loud cracks. Even their divine senses were obliterated.

Peng!

Dust billowed into the air as the two headless corpses thudded into the ground.

The surroundings became deathly silent.

Everyone trembled as a sense of indescribable terror welled up in their hearts.

Gao Huang and Hua Yongning weren’t just some random weaklings. No, they were two Heavenly Body Tier elites! Moreover, they had already reached the consummate level!

Apart from the Venerable Trinity, no one else in the galaxy should have been able to kill them, let alone insta-kill both of them at once.

This young girl... What was her true cultivation?
