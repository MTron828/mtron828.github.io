Chapter 2018: Beast tide

Lan Tianyu had achieved his purpose in this battle. With loud laughter, he strode off.

“Young Master Ling, don’t take it to heart. Firstly, Fourth Uncle’s cultivation level is above yours, and secondly, you have not been blessed by the deity yet. Otherwise, you, too, would be able to borrow power from the deity, and you would definitely not be weaker to Fourth Uncle then,” Lan Ruozhi comforted.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t take it to heart. If it was a life-or-death battle, he could guarantee that the person that would die would definitely be Lan Tianyu.

However, there was no need to say these words. Firstly, Lan Ruozhi would think that he was a sore loser, and secondly, he had no wish to reveal his trump card anyway.

“Young Master Ling, let us go and prepare the ceremony to offer sacrifices. Who knows, my father may also appreciate your natural talent, and perhaps will wish to take you as a disciple,” Lan Ruozhi said, seemingly thinking that Ling Han could no longer escape from her gentle trap.

Ling Han’s heart moved, and he asked, “What cultivation level is the Lord Island Master at?”

Lan Ruozhi hesitated slightly, but still answered, “Father is equivalent to an Ascending Origin Tier elite.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ascending Origin Tier!

Ling Han nodded internally. The strength of this island was extraordinary. If this was in the Eastern Celestial Realm, this would be a genuine four-star force, which was considerably powerful.

Led by Lan Ruozhi, Ling Han arrived in a room inside the ancient castle. Those like Qin Wei and his group were all here. Everyone was waiting. They had to first bathe and burn joss sticks, and only after a whole three days would they be able to officially enter under the banner of that deity.

Ling Han got familiar with the sequence of events. In this process, he would have to offer a sliver of his spirit respectfully to that deity. It was just a little bit, and would definitely not have any effect on him personally.

But this was something that Ling Han definitely couldn’t accept.

Firstly, to cultivate to the highest cultivation level, the spirit had to maintain the state of an absolute whole. Secondly, there were a great many evil techniques in this world that depended on the use of blood and spirit to cast.

To split out a portion of his spirit to be given to another was equivalent to placing his own life in the hands of another.

How could that be condoned?

As expected, the so-called teaching the technique to all and the so-called deity were all false. How could there be any free lunch in this world?

But looking at Qin Wei and the rest, they all looked completely unconcerned. Their yearning for further improvement of their strength had already surpassed all else.

For them, to say nothing of Celestial King Tier in this life, they might not be able to reach even Ascending Origin Tier and Immortal Palace Tier. Then why should they be concerned about how complete their spirit was? As for having their lives being under the control of another, that was something that they had not thought of at all.

...At present, their minds were filled with thoughts of having a chance to improve their strength without expending any effort.

“Everyone, are you all really going to believe that there would be such a good thing in this world?” Taking advantage of the fact that they were the only ones sitting quietly here, Ling Han spoke up.

He had no intention to save these people, and merely wanted to cause trouble for the ancient castle’s side.

“Ling Han, what do you mean?” Someone immediately jumped up. “Could it be that you wish to enjoy the blessing of the deity alone?”

Ling Han was stunned. His intentions had actually been misinterpreted thus?

“You are already a monarch tier, and can be considered invincible in your cultivation level. Even if we were blessed by the deity, we cannot possibly become stronger than you, so why do you have to envy us?”

“That’s right. I hate people like you that cannot bear to see others benefit. And you call yourself a monarch tier with that kind of limited tolerance? Pei!”

Because Qin Wei was seated there, they were not the slightest bit reserved with their words. In any case, they would be having the deity as their powerful backer in the future, so what did Ling Han being a monarch tier, or becoming a Celestial King, have to do with them?

Without need, they naturally could hold their heads high in front of Ling Han.

This seemed to have ignited the passion of the masses. They began to spout out words of crusading against Ling Han all at once, as if Ling Han had done some heinous deed.

Every half an hour, someone would come in to add another joss stick, and when the time came for the next addition, someone quietly pulled the person who was adding the joss stick aside, and said something quietly to him.

The person left, and Xiao Jun appeared only after a while, beckoning towards Ling Han as he said, “Brother Ling, please come with me for a word.”

Ling Han was sure that he had been told on.

He was curious to see what the other would do.

He stood up, and walked outside by Xiao Jun’s side.

“Brother Ling, do you still have some doubts regarding the deity that we believe in?” Xiao Jun asked calmly.

“Of course not.” Ling Han pushed the blame off himself cleanly.

“But someone has told me that Brother Ling’s resolution does not seem to be very firm,” Xiao Jun said smilingly.

“Would Brother Xiao believe me, or choose to believe a piece of trash?” Ling Han countered with his own question.

Xiao Jun couldn’t help but pause quietly. After a while, he suddenly laughed loudly, and said, “I naturally believe Brother Ling.”

Ling Han only smiled slightly. Who cared if Xiao Jun believed or not? In any case, when the time came, Ling Han would definitely cause great trouble, and then duck into the Black Tower to take refuge. An Ascending Origin Tier elite would not be able to do anything to the Black Tower, and what he had to take care about was only to avoid being killed before he successfully hid in the Black Tower.

Boom!

Just at this moment, the whole island shook with a tremor, as if an earthquake had taken place.

Xiao Jun was at a loss at first, which was quickly followed by a shocked expression. “Oh no, the beast tide has come in assault!”

Wu!

Just at this moment, the strange sound of a horn rang out. Immediately, the whole ancient castle was alerted.

“All of you come out, the beast tide is here!” Xiao Jun shot quickly into the meditation chamber, calling out to the masses.

“What beast tide?”

“Are there any beast tides on the boundless seas?”

“I never heard about this!”

Everyone exchanged looks, all appearing to be very confused and completely blank.

“Speak less rubbish, and come out quickly!” Yet Xiao Jun called out harshly.

This kind of attitude involuntarily caused a considerable number of people to feel displeased. Previously, he had repeatedly addressed them as respected guests, allowing them to enjoy fully the royal treatment, yet now his attitude had changed completely, and he kept shouting at them. This change was really too massive.

Ling Han sneered internally. The reason why the ancient castle’s people had been so courteous was merely because they wanted them to switch to cultivating the other system of cultivation, and before achieving their motive, they would naturally be incredibly cordial.

However, the appearance of this beast tide seemed to have disrupted their plans.

“If we cannot beat the beast tide, all of us will be dead!” Xiao Jun continued. These words were filled with impact. Everyone hurriedly jumped up, and quickly ran outside.

Xiao Jun suddenly turned his head, and solemnly said to Ling Han, “Brother Ling, please give your all.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “We are in the same boat. We naturally should be working together.”

“All right!”

The two of them were the last to walk out. When they walked out of the ancient castle, they saw that the people of the ancient castle had all moved out, and were going towards the west.

“Three sides of Ascent Route Island end in a steep cliff, where killing formations are placed. The beast tide cannot charge upwards along cliffs, and can only bulldoze from the western coast,” Xiao Jun explained. His figure turned into a wisp of mist, moving along with the crowds.

Ling Han followed behind him, yet his mind was beginning to wander.

Since they could lay out killing formations on three sides, why couldn’t they do the same for all four directions?

It was highly possible that they had walled three sides while allowing the last side to be open on purpose so that those who had encountered sea perils and drifted here could set foot on the island, and allow them to propagate their deity.

Furthermore, Qin Wei and the others had previously felt curious why there would be a beast tide on the seas.

These people had always traveled on the boundless seas, so they should have considerable experience, but even they had never known the fact that there would be beast tides on the seas. Why would it happen on this tiny island, then?

Just exactly what secrets were hidden on this small island?

Ling Han suddenly became extremely curious.
