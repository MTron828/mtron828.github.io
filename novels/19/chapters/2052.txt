Chapter 2053: Evenly matched

Ji Wuming smiled arrogantly. “Do I need to use a divided soul against you?”

These words were very haughty and very arrogant, but also very much like what Ji Wuming would say. As a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he had the right, and should also be this domineering in character.

Yet Ling Han gave an oh, and said, “It is only your main body that has entered here, while your divided soul has gone somewhere else.”

Ji Wuming paused slightly. He had not expected Ling Han to be so sensitive. He nodded, and said, “That’s right. Now that I have a divided soul, I should do some more work, and obtain more fated opportunities.”

As expected of Ji Wuming!

This kind of feeling surged up in Ling Han’s heart. When the other party lacked a divided soul, he could still battle Ling Han to a stalemate. Even though he presently had the upper hand, that had been because he had caught Ji Wumingoff guard. If he wanted to kill the other man, it would be extremely difficult.

Of course, it would also be incredibly difficult for Ji Wuming to kill Ling Han. For those that had reached heights like they had, it was difficult to decide the victor, and even more difficult to kill their opponent.

“Die!” Ji Wuming bore injuries, but he was also even more formidable than before. It was like the bloodshed had excited him, causing him to regain his fighting spirit.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two absolute monarch tiers burst into a great battle. The “卐” character in Ji Wuming’s eyes blazed brightly, boosting him with endless power, and made him incredibly terrifying.

Ling Han did not show weakness, either. Since he had already used the Great Clash of Source Powers, he also used it repeatedly, exerting a great pressure on Ji Wuming.

As expected, Ji Wuming was really a supreme prodigy, one who used to be a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Though the Great Clash of Source Powers could make Ji Wuming very wary, he had already found a way to deal with it, and that was using the Regulations of Space and Time to distribute the impact.

Before Celestial King Tier, the Regulations of Space and Time could overwhelm any single Regulations of the Five Elements. Though Ling Han had made use of the resonance of the four Source Powers, he lacked one of the five elements, so the might was considerably weaker as well.

In summary, this was still not enough to suppress Ji Wuming.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel astonished. It should be known that Ji Wuming presently was still not in his prime state. He still had a divided soul that had yet to enter the battle. And even then, he could still battle Ling Han to a tie, which meant that the latter was still no match for Ji Wuming.

A reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King was really too difficult to deal with, for he was overwhelmingly strong.

This battle continued for three days and three nights. The two great monarch tiers used all methods they could, launching powerful moves with every movement. If it had been any other person, even if it was a Heaven Soul Tier monarch tier, they would probably have been killed by now.

…The Great Clash of Source Powers, the Severed Passion Sword, and so on were too frightening in their might.

Both of them stopped at the same time, facing off against one another.

“If it was not because I have to kill you, I really would like to befriend you,” Ji Wuming said smilingly, his fighting spirit still blazing hotly.

“You are indeed the strongest opponent I have faced.” Ling Han nodded, showing an expression of respect.

Aside from Ji Wuming, there had been no other person that could fill him with such a feeling of pressure. Furthermore, in a situation in which their cultivation levels were equal, Ji Wuming was the first opponent that Ling Han had not been able to defeat, and was the only one too.

“I cannot kill you this time. We will battle another day.” Ji Wuming was also very decisive. Even if they continued fighting, it would only be a waste of time. With his great skill and strategy, he naturally could not possibly waste his time here.

He turned around, and as his figure rose, he soon disappeared into the distance.

Ling Han did not set out in pursuit. Ji Wuming couldn’t kill him, and he couldn’t kill Ji Wuming, either. Continuing the battle was absolutely meaningless.

He was going to get the fifth Source Power of heaven and earth as soon as possible, and it had to be Earth Element at that so that the Great Clash of Source Powers could unleash its strongest might.

‘In this battle, my stamina was also very crucial.’ Ling Han did not continue his journey at the first moment, but rather summed up a conclusion from the previous battle.

Perhaps Ji Wuming did not need it, because there were really too many prodigies he had fought, but Ling Han was different. It was the first time he had encountered as troublesome an opponent as Ji Wuming, and would need to ensure he attained perfection in all details.

‘If I had stronger stamina, I would be able to attack faster. At first, I would be able to deliver 10,000 punches in a single breath, and in the future, it could be increased to 11,000, 12,000, or even 20,000-30,000.’

After three days, Ling Han finally stood up, and continued to advance.

Soon, a streak of Dragon’s Breath appeared ahead of him. It took human form, and its manifestation was not affected just because Ji Wuming had already passed this way once.

Ling Han did not directly use the Great Clash of Source Powers, but rather used this opponent to enrich his own battle prowess. Previously, he had summarized what he had learnt for so long, so there should be a little improvement.

However, with the prerequisite that he didn’t use the Great Clash of Source Powers, he was still no match for this streak of Dragon’s Breath. Still, compared to before, he had indeed achieved a certain degree of improvement.

He should not waste any more time.

Ling Han channeled the Great Clash of Source Powers.?Boom, the wild waves of Regulations surged out, and this streak of Dragon’s Breath was instantly dispersed.

“I need even more Dragon’s Breath!”

He barged his way through, searching for more Dragon’s Breath. However, there seemed to be a rhythm here. After he had passed, there would not be new Dragon’s Breath birthed on his path, no matter how many times he passed back and forth.

Not only was it this case for Dragon’s Breath, it was the same for the Bloom of Dao. Ling Han did not believe that Ji Wuming would choose not to pluck any Bloom of Dao if he had passed any.

He cautiously used the Regulations of Space to split off the space that he was in as he retrieved this Bloom of Dao.

Ling Han gained an understanding. The dragon bridge was actually a kind of bestowal, but the prerequisite was you had to be able to retrieve it.

For different dragon bridges, the strength of the Dragon’s Breath should also be different, and there should not be any Bloom of Dao on the other dragon bridges. At least Ling Han had not heard Fu Yue and the others say anything about it.

Ling Han walked along the bridge. Unless he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his feet would still be pricked uncomfortably, so he wanted to stay longer on this bridge, and retrieve more Dragon’s Breath and Blooms of Dao, but at the same time he hoped to quickly reach the end so he would not need continue to endure this suffering.

Whether he was willing or not, the dragon bridge had finally shown him its end three months later.

Ling Han could see a gigantic dragon’s head biting onto the other side of the cliff. Each of its dragon’s whiskers fluttered elegantly, exuding a captivating air of dominance.

In these three months, his cultivation level had already reached the peak stage of Yang Soul Tier, and his stamina had also been increased to a terrifying extent, so he could wrestle with Heaven Soul Tier. However, Celestials tended to contest in Regulations, while Origin Power and stamina were only secondary, no matter how strong you were in these aspects.

But stronger stamina meant that you would be able to move faster and last longer, so there was naturally only benefit and no disadvantage to possessing it.

Ling Han leaped down from the dragon’s head, and when he turned his head, the dragon bridge had disappeared from sight.

This also meant that he could not go back the way that he had come, and could only forge his way ahead.

Ji Wuming was faster than him.

A feeling of urgency rose up in Ling Han’s heart, but he did not move out immediately. Instead, he sat down cross-legged here, waiting for Hu Niu and the others.

In this place, the 3,000 dragon heads converged, and as long as they managed to cross the bridge, they would all reunite here. However, it was not everyone that was qualified to reach this place. The weak would be eliminated at the first instant.

Ling Han sat as steady as a mountain, and there would occasionally be people coming off from the dragon bridge, passing him by.

Some would stride past him, rushing on their way, while some would stop and look at him for a while, curious about why Ling Han was seated here.

“Ling Han!” Two days later, a delicate and charming young girl leaped down from the dragon’s head, suddenly leaping into Ling Han’s arms. Who else could it be but Hu Niu? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The little girl clung to Ling Han’s arms, her arms hooked around his neck. “Did Ling Han miss Niu?”

“Of course I did,” Ling Han said smilingly.

“Let’s leave quickly so we can take the chance to lose those two great witches!” The little girl’s eyes were wide, her face filled with anticipation.
