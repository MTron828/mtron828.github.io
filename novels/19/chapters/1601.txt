Chapter 1602: Furiously thrashed

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “If we’re talking about punishment, that is not up to you, either, so don’t pretend to be so righteous! I say, previously, you brought that ugly woman to make trouble for me, and I haven’t called you to an accounting for that yet.”

“Humph, what right do you have to defy the Saint Missus?” Cai Miao asked coldly, and the gaze he directed at Ling Han contained a sliver of jealousy.

He was indeed jealous of this young man before him.

When he had first entered into the academy, he was forced to crawl through the dog’s hole, and though this spurred on his endless fervor, it could not be denied that his heart had still been twisted by the experience. But what made him even more indignant was the fact that Ling Han had an incomparably beautiful and boundlessly graceful exquisite lady by his side.

What part of him was inferior to Ling Han? Why was it not him that got the aid of a person of high rank, and avoided the humiliation of crawling through the dog’s hole? Why was it not him who had an incomparably beautiful empress by his side?

Thus, he had always been hostile to Ling Han.

When the two of them had been confronting each other, other disciples discovered them as well, and they couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. I called another, and you called another, and suddenly more people had come over.

“Ling Han!”

“It’s Ling Han!”

“He actually came back!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

Everyone called out. Though there were some people that hated Ling Han because he had caused them to have no cultivation resources to use in the last several years, there were more who remembered that it was he who had stepped out to protect the pride of the academy, and resolutely took three blows from Hu Yingmu, forcing Hu Yingmu to make a public apology, and it was Ling Han who killed the latter on the spot.

To the majority, this was a legend.

Now that the legend had appeared in front of them, it was natural that everyone would be excited, and they all began cheering.

Ling Han nodded at the masses, which was considered greeting them. There were too many people here. He did not have the time to greet each and every one of them.

“Ling Han!” Cai Miao shouted loudly. He was naturally not willing to be ignored completely.

“Don’t be anxious; I haven’t forgotten you!” Ling Han turned to look at him, a coldness flickering in his eyes. He felt that Cai Miao was deliberately targeting him, and was not like the others, who had resented him previously only because he had broken a “tradition”.

‘Since you are targeting me, there is no need for me to be polite, either.’

“Come fight me!” Cai Miao shouted loudly. The Star Sand Martial Arts Academy did not have any rule against using one’s superior strength to bully a weaker opponent. If you are afraid of being beaten, then just obediently stay in your own quarters and not come out.

“Cai Miao, are you even human?” Ren Feiyun strode out. “Previously, when a Saint arrived and wilfully trod on the pride of our academy, where were you? Why did you not jump out then? Instead, it was Ling Han. He stepped out, and took back the pride of our academy, but what about you? You are actually treating him like this now!”

His expression was filled with disdain. “At the time, why didn’t you challenge Ling Han? Humph, at that time, Ling Han still had the battle prowess of a Saint King burning, and had incomparable battle prowess, and you did not even dare challenge him at all!

“If you want a battle, come, I will be your opponent!”

These words were powerful and resonating, and also made the majority respond in kind. They all began to cheer, supporting Ling Han.

Cai Miao couldn’t help but look livid, and exclaimed, “Don’t forget, it was also because of him that the academy was implicated! And what did he do? He just simply slipped away, but what about us? You all think about it, what cultivation resources have you all gotten these few years, and whose fault was it?”

“Cai Miao, have you had enough!” Ren Feiyun’s tone was icy cold. He could no longer hold himself back from making a move.

Shua, it was at this time, a figure moved before he managed to, and leaped towards Cai Miao. It was precisely the Empress.

He dared to insult her husband?

Watch out for the attack!

With a wave of her hand, she delivered a slap at Cai Miao.

“Humph!” Cai Miao was uncaring. Previously, the Empress was capable of fighting him to a tie, and that was because the latter had a strange brick in her possession that could absorb all attacks. It was not because the Empress’s own power was a match for his.

‘And now, without taking that brick, you still want to fight me?’

He smirked coldly, and knew this kind of noble, proud woman had to be defeated first before one could conquer her heart. Otherwise, she would not even bother to cast an eye on you.

“You are no match for me, I do not want to wound—”

Pa!

Cai Miao had not finished his words when he had already sustained a heavy slap. His whole person was suddenly flipped over. Pu, blood gushed madly, creating an arc in midair like a rainbow, though it was more tragically than naturally beautiful.

The Empress stood there, incredibly proud. Her expression was filled with disdain; it was clearly such a disdainful expression, yet everyone found it hard to feel the slightest bit of dislike, and only felt that the Empress was really too formidable and aggressive.

They very much wanted to worship her!

Once Cai Miao’s behind landed on the ground, he immediately bounced back to his feet, his expression filled with humiliation and rage. He looked over the Empress again, and menacingly said, “So you have advanced into the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, no wonder!”

This was extremely shocking. It should be known that when the Empress first entered the academy, she was only in the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, yet now she shockingly reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, and was already capable of breaking through to the Saint-level.

Everyone inhaled sharply. Those that could enter this place naturally were all prodigies and king tiers of their respective galaxies. They were used as examples for others to compare themselves to—just look at that so-and-so, he had already entered into the Mountain River Tier in how many years, and already become a Sun Moon Tier in how many years, but compared with Empress Luan Xing, they were all trash.

Yet Cai Miao did not show any sign of fear. Previously, he had underestimated her strength, and furthermore, he walked the path of using oneself as a formation. When the formation activated, that was the true reflection of his real strength.

“You have angered me!” he declared. Weng, weng, weng. A killing formation activated inside him, and multiple formation patterns appeared on his skin, inconceivably frightening.

Pa!

The Empress delivered another slap, and Cai Miao was once again sent flying.

This... What was going on here!?

Though they had heard Cai Miao say that Empress Luan Xing had already reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, not one person really thought that the Empress would be capable of matching Cai Miao, because he was one of the three great big shots of the eighth campus.

What did the name ‘big shot’ mean? It meant being invincible among his peers!

They believed that as long as Cai Miao’s killing formation activated, he would definitely be able to restrain the Empress. After all, she had just broken through to this cultivation level, so how could she possibly oppose a big shot?

But the result gave everyone a heavy slap in the face.

So what if the killing formation activated? He would still be thrashed!

“...” Ren Feiyun.

“...” All the disciples.

“Impossible!” Cai Miao covered his face with one hand; even his hair was slightly messy. He stared at the Empress in astonishment. He definitely could not accept this result.

How could the Empress possibly bother with him? Her slender hand moved repeatedly. Pa, pa, pa. A bout of slaps was delivered, and Cai Miao had completely no way of fighting back.

At present, not only was her cultivation level equal to Cai Miao’s, she was a Divine Fetus as well, and had also cultivated a good several celestial techniques. How could it be that such battle prowess would still be unable to crush a false big shot? Without entering into the pinnacle level, how could he possibly be called a big shot?

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

Everyone was watching in dumbfounded shock. The big shot they were all so sure of, Cai Miao, who would definitely not lose in a battle of equal levels, was now as fragile as if he was a weak scholar that had never cultivated in his life.

This was too f******* unbelievable!
