Chapter 875: Understanding

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Sorry about that your sister!

Corpse Boss felt like he was about to go crazy; did this kind of monster really exist? He had only rounded his cultivation and improved the standard of his Body Arts, and his power had begun to spike madly again. Attaining another Star seemed to be something as easy as eating for him.

Ling Han was also speechless; his current strength had primarily been improved on by the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art. After breaking through to the Shattering Void Tier, this Body Art had finally burst out with a terrifying might.

At the extreme, it could reach the power of nine True Dragons!

This was nothing like the kind of false True Dragon that Helian Tianyun was. In the Immortal Realm, only those of the dragon race that had reached Genesis Tier could be called True Dragons. The power of nine True Dragons... how frightening would that be?

Previously, when he had helped Ding Ping to remold his body, it was also a training exercise for himself. Along with the three days of minor seclusion he had gone through afterwards, his Body Arts had improved abruptly.

Now, his brute strength was at least three times stronger than his Origin Power; this Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art had finally shown its true might.

According to Ling Han’s estimation, Origin Power cultivated to the extreme could reach the strength of a single True Dragon. Then his pure strength, at most, would be able to reach nine times the strength of his Origin Power—of course, this was also because the Origin Power Cultivation Technique he was cultivating was not good enough, and so could only reach the basic level of “one”, or perhaps not even reach one.

Yi, then in that case, if he did not depend on the empowerment from power of the nation, his lifeforce would also be able to reach twelve Stars of Shattering Void Tier?

Ling Han suddenly sank into deep thought. Why was there a need to depend on power of the nation to reach the extreme? Why could an individual not rely on himself to be able to push his cultivation level to the extreme? In the world of martial arts, the final goal was always individual strength; you couldn’t possibly bear a nation on your shoulders and run around everywhere, right?

Understanding finally dawned on him. Power of the nation could only be supplementary, and could not be a means to be relied on.

... He wanted to depend on his own power to advance to the level of twenty Stars of the Shattering Void Tier, the true limit!

A muscle in Corpse Boss’s cheek twitched. After Ling Han delivered an attack, it was as if he had gone dumb; just how far was he looking down on him? ‘I am indeed no match to you, but being so absent-minded like this, you’ve gone too far, haven’t you?’

“Ling Han!” he roared in fury.

Ling Han came back to himself, and could not help but smile as he said, “Sorry, sorry. I suddenly thought of something.”

To lose focus in the midst of battle, what f****** exactly were you thinking about? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What were you thinking about?” Corpse Boss could not help but feel curious.

“I was thinking about how to improve my strength to reach twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier.” Ling Han did not cover up the truth; he really wanted to discuss it with another person, especially someone like Corpse Boss who had been an elite for two eras. Unfortunately, he could no longer remember the matters of his last life.

Corpse Boss inhaled sharply, and said, “Are you sure you are not talking about battle prowess of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, but strength at the level of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier?”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded.

“You... monster!” Corpse Boss pointed out.

“Hey, hey, hey. Brother Corpse Boss, though we have only met once, we did have an enjoyable conversation. Is it really appropriate for you to insult me like this?” Ling Han asked with a laugh.

“If your strength could rush up to twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, then what level would your battle prowess reach?” Corpse Boss rolled his eyes repetitively; just the mere thought of it was terrifying.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Humans should have some dreams, shouldn’t they?”

Corpse Boss was stunned momentarily before finally nodding somberly. He said, “Yes!” Then stretching out both arms, he said, “There are still nine moves!”

Ling Han grinned. His right hand stretched out again to press down on Corpse Boss.

Corpse Boss received the attack, and shouted, “Ling Han, show me all your ability; don’t make me look down on you!”

“Is that so?” Ling Han used his other hand to rub his nose. “All right, then!” He used the Earth Overturning Seal, and circulated the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven.Hong , a brilliant golden light as well as blazing lightning exuded from his right hand.

Peng!

His palm pressed down, and there was suddenly no sign of Corpse Boss anymore.

“Brother Corpse Boss, are you all right?” Ling Han asked as he withdrew his hand.

Corpse Boss climbed back up, coughing up blood endlessly. His face was filled with desolation as he mumbled, “I actually did not even manage to block a single move; I couldn’t even block a single move!”

One had to know that he was an existence that possessed battle prowess of fifteen Stars of Shattering Void Tier, and if Ling Han had not been lenient, that previous blow would be enough to take his life.

The gap was too big.

After staring blankly for a moment, his gaze gradually became firm again. If Ling Han succeeded in splitting open the skies, then he would be able to enter into the Immortal Realm, and he would definitely be able to find a means to become even stronger!

Just as Ling Han said, what if he could increase his pure strength to the level of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier?

“The members of the Thousand Corpse Sect have hidden about two hundred miles east of here. There is an ancient cemetery there,” Corpse Boss said, staring at Ling Han. “The next time we meet, I hope we can battle to our hearts’ content.”

“All right!” Ling Han agreed decisively. He had always had a very good impression of Corpse Boss.

Corpse Boss stared at Ling Han for a moment, then turned and left.

Ding Ping watched from the side, his blood racing, wanting nothing more than to possess such battle prowess at this moment as well so that he could have a vigorous battle himself.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “The next time that man comes to challenge me, you will accept his challenge on my behalf.”

Ding Ping was initially stunned before he immediately became so excited that he almost passed out. He could feel the fighting spirit in his whole body soar up to the heavens, and some unknown emotion awakened in himself, which made him experience a fathomless heroic spirit.

He half-knelt on the ground, and said, “I will definitely not disappoint you, Master!”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Now, I should go clear away the last problem on the path of splitting open the skies.”

He brought Ding Ping with him. A few steps later, he arrived at the cemetery that Corpse Boss had spoken of.

As the Thousand Corpse Sect cultivated Corpse Techniques, their entire bodies were filled with Corpse Qi, and if they were buried underground, no one could possibly distinguish them from actual corpses. Thus, graves were naturally their best hiding place. Unless Ling Han was determined enough to dig out all the graves in the world, it would definitely be impossible for him to find them.

But now with a man inside, it was a different story.

Without another word, Ling Han directly formed his arm into the shape of a bow, formed his Origin Power into an arrow, and circulated out the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow. From afar, he aimed at that ancient cemetery. His hand loosened, and xiu , the arrow of Origin Power was fired, and hong , shot into the ancient cemetery.

It was best for the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow to have the base of an actual arrow, and only then would the arrow shot express its greatest might. However, Ling Han was too strong by now, and he had absolutely no need for an actual arrow to express an incredibly powerful might.

This was a real secret technique of the Immortal Realm!

Hong !

The arrow of Origin Power shot down, and the whole ancient cemetery instantly disappeared, becoming a deep pit.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. A dozen over people shot up into the skies.

The Ninth Underworld King, Corpse Two, Rong Huan Xuan, as well as nine elders that were all skin and bones. Corpse Qi wound around their whole bodies, and if they appeared in the middle of the night, they would definitely give anyone a deadly shock.

With this strike, all those below Heaven Tier would be exterminated!

“Ling Han!” When he saw Ling Han, Rong Huan Xuan immediately gritted his teeth. He and Ling Han could really be considered old foes; they had been entangled with each other from the very beginning in the Desolate North. But, aside from their first meeting when he had gotten the upper hand, he had always been suppressed by Ling Han afterwards. This caused a thorn to be stuck deeply in his heart.

One had to know that he, too, had advanced into the Heaven Tier by now. To break through so quickly, it was frightening, but compared with Ling Han, it was really not worth mentioning.

In front of Ling Han, he paled in comparison, and could only become a pitiful background for Ling Han’s brilliance.

He would not submit; he was also one who had obtained the favor of the heavens!
