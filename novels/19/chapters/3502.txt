Chapter 3503: Visit to the Highest Splendor Sect

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Highest Splendor Sect was located in the northwest of the Imperial Capital, close to Haiping Mountain, where the Ancient Dao Sect had once been. There was another reason why Ling Han had chosen the Highest Splendor Sect, and that was to visit Brother Monkey.

The two of them set out with the seven Calabash Brothers. Of course, there was also the war colossus. It was clear that the Highest Splendor Sect had no intention of surrendering. Thus, they could not have a wasted trip. If they did not surrender, then sorry, they could only raze the sect to the ground.

This time, they were rich and imposing. They had borrowed a warship, and finally did not have to travel on their own two legs.

The warship’s speed was naturally not as fast as theirs, but its advantage was that it could travel day and night continuously, and was not restricted by the terrain. Overall, it was not much slower than their own speed.

Seven days later, they steered the warship and slowly descended. Ling Han laid out a simple invisible formation. As long as others did not walk into this formation, they would not discover the existence of the warship.

Then, he and Princess Bixiao continued onwards with the children, and arrived at the main gate of the Highest Splendor Sect.

You guys are late. The deadline for disciple recruitment is three days ago.” The two of them had not even opened their mouths, when a guard called out to him.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “We are not here to enlist as disciples.”

“Then what are you guys here for?” That guard appeared to be very curious. “We are from the Foreign Affairs Department of the Dark North Nation. We have something to discuss with your sect master,” Princess Bixiao continued. The guard faltered, “What Foreign Affairs Department? Leave, our sect master has no time to see you guys.”

How preposterous. Any random person just dares to come to our Highest Splendor Sect.” Another guard walked over, and stretched out a hand to push Princess Bixiao away.

It was clear that he had ulterior motives. His hand was pressing down towards Princess Bixiao’s chest.

Princess Bixiao’s expression turned cold. However, before she could fly into a rage, pa, the sound of a slap rang out. Ling Han had already moved, and directly sent this outrageously bold guy flying.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You actually dare to harrass a Mystery

Realm Tier elite? I truly admire your courage.”

The remaining guard was both furious and shocked. As he sent out the signal, he said, “You actually dare to cause injury in the territory of the Highest Splendor Sect. Don’t run!”

Ling Han crossed his arms over his chest, and said, “Don’t worry, we won’t run.”

F***, this was too calm, wasn’t it?

That guard thought internally, what kind of background did this whatever department have? How could these two people be so calm?

In a short while, they saw people coming down from the mountain, and it was not just one, but a dozen over. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What’s going on?” a young man in yellow robes asked. A young man and woman brought six children over – en, you guys are really good at giving birth.

“Seventh Senior Brother, these two people say that they’re from some Foreign Affairs Department and wish to see the sect master.” The guard hurriedly paid his respects, then briefly explained the situation.

“Foreign Affairs Department?”

“What Foreign Affairs Department?”

“Never heard of it.”

Everyone shook their heads. Including the yellow-robed young man, he seemed to have the highest status among these people. When his eyes swept over the princess of the Demon Race, he obviously paused for a moment, and said, “Lord Master not only has to deal with the internal affairs of the sect, he also has to cultivate. If he just barely managed to take out some time, which is also used to guide disciples like us.”

He paused for a moment, then said, “You all can inform me of your intentions.

I will find a chance to inform Lord Master.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said with a smile, “You have misunderstood something. We have not come to seek an audience with Sect Leader Gongsun, but have come under the command of the Holy Emperor to make an amnesty.” “En?” Those people from the Highest Splendor Sect all looked furious.

What a joke. Their sect master was a Celestial Path elite, and an emperor of the secular world actually wanted to demand amnesty?

“What a joke!” The Seventh Senior Brother immediately rebuked, “Chen Fengyan is only an Enlightenment Tier elite, yet he actually wants to recruit Lord Master. This is the biggest joke in the world!”

He had also been a member of the Dark North Nation before, but he had come from a poor background. It was only after the great change in heaven and earth began fiercely this time that he was fortunate enough to join the Highest Splendor Sect. As a result, his cultivation level soared.

Thus, in his eyes, Gongsun Liang was naturally like a god. How could Chen Fengyan compare to him?

On the other hand, it was also because news had been cut off after the great change in heaven and earth. Someone like him, who was completely focused on cultivating, naturally could not possibly know what kind of changes had taken place in this great era.

“Capture them!” the other disciples shouted as well.

Two people immediately rushed out, grabbing out at Ling Han.

Sigh, did they think that he was an easy target to bully?

Ling Han snapped his fingers. Peng! The two of them were instantly sent flying by a burst of power.

“Good move!” The seven toddlers all applauded in unison.

“Yi, you actually have some abilities.” Seventh Senior Brother looked at Ling Han, his expression slightly solemn. Clearly, he had underestimated Ling Han’s abilities.

He stepped out, and said proudly, “However, in front of me, your abilities are far from enough.”

“Seventh Senior Brother is so mighty!”

“Seventh Senior Brother, kill him. He actually dared to come to our Highest

Splendor Sect to be insolent. How could we not teach him a lesson?”

The others called out one after another.

Seventh Senior Brother revealed a cold smirk, and stretched out a hand to grab

Ling Han. Boom, a deep power surged out.

Actually, his natural talent was extraordinary. It was just that he had come from a poor background, so his cultivation progress was slow. It was only after he joined the Highest Splendor Sect that his cultivation level began to soar madly. Thus, this also caused him to view himself as an extraordinary talent. Others were mediocre, and were not worthy of his notice at all.

In fact, if he had been taken as disciple by Gongsun Liang earlier, his cultivation level could have even surpassed Eldest Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother and the others.

Ling Han looked even younger than him, and as he saw it, he was naturally far inferior to him. His attacks were extremely casual.

Ling Han still flicked out a finger, extremely casually.

“You actually dare to look down on me?” Seventh Senior Brother humphed. At first, he had only used 30% of his power, and now, it had suddenly increased to 70%.

Peng!

The wind from his finger swept past, and a shocked expression immediately appeared on Seventh Senior Brother’s face. However, it was already too late. His entire body was sent flying, and he crashed heavily onto the ground. He had directly lost consciousness.

“What?!” The others were all astounded. That was their Seventh Senior Brother, and also the first disciple that Gongsun Liang had taken after establishing the sect. In terms of natural talent in cultivation, he was even the number one in the sect, yet he couldn’t even withstand a single finger from Ling Han?

“Quick, an extremely terrifying opponent has come. We need to ask Second Senior Brother to step out.”

“No, we have to get Eldest Senior Brother!”

Everyone discussed animatedly, while hurriedly issuing warnings of enemy attack.

Not long after, a large group of people ran down from the mountain.

The seven babies were all in high spirits, and all of them began to roll up their sleeves.

“Father, don’t stop us. Leave this guy to us!”

Who dares to be so brazen, to actually dare act insolently in our Highest

Splendor Sect?” A middle-aged man in black asked coldly.

Second Senior Brother, these two shamelessly boasted, saying that they wanted amnesty from Lord Sect Master, and even caused an injury!” the disciples hurriedly said.

The black-robed man was the Second Senior Brother of the Highest Splendor Sect, Tu Jianbai. He was not a citizen of the Dark North Nation, but had been born in the prison. He had long since followed Gongsun Liang, and was taken as his disciple. Thus, he looked to be in his forties, but his true age was already m his sixties. It was just that his lifespan was longer, so he did not appear old.

“So it is Ling Han and Princess Bixiao.” Tu Jianbai smiled. Not only did he not make a move, he even clasped his hands in greeting towards the two of them..
