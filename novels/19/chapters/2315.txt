Chapter 2316 Battle of equals

You Yuan was the top elite of the academy. Even among all the Eighth Lotuses of the entire Foreign Realm, You Yuan was also a top-tier existence, yet now he was actually driven into a tizzy by a mere Second Lotus, which made him feel both sullen and furious.

It was not that he had no weapon he could not draw. However, before it could even touch the Divine Demon Sword, it would be broken in half with just a sweep of Sword Qi.

Having a Demon charge all the way into the Angel Quarters, with himself being suppressed, if he did not defeat Ling Han, what face would he have left as the top elite of the academy?

Hence, he would rather choose a battle of equal levels. He was confident that his strength was still sufficient for defeating Ling Han.

Ling Han slanted a disdainful look at him, yet still withdrew the Divine Demon Sword.

“No longer acting the coward?” he asked with a laugh, his mockery evident.

You Yuan’s breath quickened. There had never been anyone that dared to act arrogant in front of him. Anyone who dared do so had all been killed by him. But the problem now was that he really had no possibility of killing Ling Han. This naturally made him feel incredibly uncomfortable.

“Disaster comes from a reckless tongue!” he threatened menacingly.

Ling Han chuckled. “Your eyes have gone blind if you dare to covet even my woman! Moreover, you even played dirty tricks on me. If I don’t beat you into a pig’s head, I will not be able to vent this anger!”

‘Your woman?’ You Yuan couldn’t help but rage. The first time he set eyes on the Empress, he was already deeply captivated. What an exquisite beauty, with such majestic bearing, so noble, so proud.

Only this kind of woman was worthy of him! If that had not been the case, he would not have targeted Ling Han deliberately. How could Ling Han be worthy?

“You are seeking death!” he roared, the lotus flower on his forehead trembling. One after another, the leaves disappeared. He was forcefully suppressing his cultivation level. Otherwise, once Ling Han drew the Divine Demon Sword again, he would still only be able to run and hide.

Of course, even if he suppressed his cultivation level, it was possible that Ling Han would still draw the Divine Demon Sword again. This would depend on Ling Han’s trustworthiness.

Finally, he became Eighth Lotus Second Leaf, completely equal to Ling Han’s present cultivation level.

He took a deep breath, and stretched out his right hand. Weng, weng, weng. Multiple seals lit up on his arm, and the halo above his head blazed like a sun. His wings flapped, and his whole figure was lifted into the air, as if a war god had descended from the heavens. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Countless women of the Angel Race were completely enraptured with this scene as their hearts all beat faster. They wanted nothing more than to throw themselves into the arms of this mighty, handsome man.

In comparison, Ling Han, as a member of the Demon Race, was really too ugly, covered completely with red skin and bearing distorted features.

Only Celestial Maiden Yunhe was an exception. Her mind was filled with Ling Han’s heroic image inside the Mystery Realm. Even if her memory was missing a few crucial scenes, her heart was still moved. However, this was the Angel Quarters, and she could not cheer Ling Han on in broad daylight and full public.

Ling Han scoffed, and swept a glance at him. “Bird man, I will beat you down onto the ground in 100 moves at most.”

“How dare you!!” You Yuan roared in fury. With a flap of his wings, xiu, he shot forwards, and charged over to Ling Han. The halo above his head suddenly exploded with light that was off the charts. Even the spectators in the surroundings found their vision completely overtaken by golden light, and could not see anything else at all.

This was the full-power blow of an Eighth Lotus Second Leaf Monarch Star. It was natural that not many below Eighth Lotus could see clearly. Only those three Eighth Lotus monarch tiers could see that You Yuan turned into a streak of light, sending a punch right at Ling Han.

Ling Han cracked a grin, and suddenly delivered a punch.

Boom, when this punch was shot out, the air was instantly compressed. Peng, peng, peng, endless creases were formed. The scene was really bizarre. Space could actually be creased?

With how powerful his stamina was, it had long since advanced into Ascending Origin Tier. Thus, even when he attacked later, it was his attack that reached first, and directly shot right in front of You Yuan.

You Yuan was stunned, and concentrated his Spiritual Power without a second thought. A giant hand of light was formed in front of his face, meeting the punch that Ling Han delivered.

‘How could it be so fast?’ he roared inwardly. This kind of attack speed was completely illogical

Peng!

Ling Han’s fist crashed into the giant hand of light, and with a boom, this large hand of light immediately shattered, and the fist penetrated it deeply, continuing to blast towards You Yuan’s face.

‘What?!’

Seeing this scene, Wu Ya, Xun Feng, and Lu Yuanxin were all exclaiming soundlessly. Their cultivation levels were similar, and they were both Monarch Stars, so their strength should be extremely close. No, You Yuan’s cultivation level might have been repressed to Second Leaf, but it was definitely the peak stage of the Second Leaf, and it was possible that Ling Han had not reached the peak stage. Perhaps he was only in the late stage, middle stage, or even early stage?

In other words, the chance that You Yuan had an advantage in cultivation level was still very high, though this advantage might be very small.

Yet Ling Han had practically managed to suppress You Yuan with a single punch; how could this be!

If it had been someone else, they would probably have had to suffer this loss helplessly, but You Yuan was a Monarch Star. Countless Divine Swords of light actually surged out from his body, and swept towards Ling Han’s fist.

This was an amazing move. Not only could it resolve his own crisis, it could also cause a severe injury to Ling Han. Who asked the latter to actually dare to penetrate deeply with just a single “fist”?

A battle at close quarters was a great taboo among cultivators, unless one had an absolute advantage in strength.

Ling Han laughed. Lightning wrapped around his fist, and he had absolutely no intention to withdraw his fist. Peng, his fist landed on You Yuan’s face, and xiu, xiu, xiu, countless swords of light also landed on his fist and arm at the same time.

You Yuan was sent back several dozen meters, the halo above his head dimming, which also allowed the masses to recover their sight. ‘What?!’

When they could see clearly, everyone was gaping, and felt a chill run down their spines. Disbelief was written all over their faces!

… There was actually a trace of blood at the corners of You Yuan’s lips.

Hiss, You Yuan had actually been injured!

How could they believe this? He was the top elite of the academy, and had led the academy to win the first place[1] of the Thousand Academy Tournament 1,000,000 years ago, yet now he had actually been injured with a single blow, and it was a strike to the face at that. Who would believe this if they heard it?

However, the young prodigies of all four quarters were here, and they all witnessed it with their own eyes.

Was this really not an illusion that Ling Han had created?

“You, deserve, death!” You Yuan roared to the heavens. Though his counterattack had all landed on Ling Han’s arm, it had not caused any harm. Ling Han’s physique was incredibly strong.

When he spoke these three words, even his voice was trembling. That was because Ling Han had used the Regulations of Lightning in this punch, electrocuting him to numbness, so his voice was naturally stuttering when he spoke.

Ling Han only flicked his hand in response, and said, “What a hard-skinned face, my hand is slightly aching from the impact!”

Everyone was speechless. ‘You struck his face with your fist, and you actually said that his face was too hard, so your hand hurts now? Wasn’t that simply mockery?’

You Yuan’s expression became solemn. He had already forcefully suppressed his fury. He looked coldly, and with a shake of his hands, a blade of light appeared in his hold. This was not an actual weapon, but a blade he had manifested through Spiritual Power and Regulations.

“I did not expect that you have actually cultivated the Regulations of Lightning.”

The Regulations of Lightning had frightening destructive power. Even now, there was still a fizzling in his body, and his blood was filled with violent factors, affecting the flow of his Spiritual Power.

He adjusted his attitude completely. In this academy, there really was someone that could threaten his sole dominance. “However, the Regulations of Light are not the only Regulations I cultivate!” He exuded a terrifying killing intent. It was as if his whole person had turned into an executioner’s blade, capable of destroying the whole world.
