Chapter 3537: Passed

Ling Han disappeared again.

The Mystery Realm Tier elites finally became afraid. This opponent was far too terrifying. He had arrived soundlessly, and it was as if he could become invisible. He wouldn’t reveal himself until the attack reached his target. It was almost impossible to defend against.

And when he left, he only had to take a single step, and his whereabouts would be unknown in an instant, and no one would be able to stop him at all.

This was practically a super assassin; who wouldn’t be afraid?

Xiu, someone immediately flew away, not making a sound at all, directly betraying his teammates.

What did it matter? In any case, they did not know each other.

Once there was one, there would be two. Those Mystery Realm Tiers left one after another, including the Mystery Realm Tier that had been knocked unconscious. He had long since been awakened, but because he was plagued by bad luck, he ran seven steps and actually fell five times, causing his face to turn green.

Some Enlightenment Tier elites fled as well, fearing that if Ling Han wasn’t able to find the main culprit, he would start a massacre. However, even more people stayed behind. Since they had a clear conscience, they were naturally unafraid.

In any case, Ling Han didn’t look like an unreasonable person.

However, they no longer saw Ling Han appear, because Ling Han had removed his cloak, and slowly arrived with his seven children. No one would be able to connect him, a father, with the previous murderous demon.

After waiting for a while, the wooden raft appeared again.

Ling Han snatched a ship and boarded it with his seven children.

“How fun!”

“Father, row quickly, we want to get first place!”

The toddlers called out one after another, all of them having fun.

When the others saw this, they all shook their heads.

Wasn’t this a joke? He actually brought six toddlers here; he really didn’t know how the word death was written.

However, no one was in the mood to care at this moment. The Mystery Realm Tier elites had all fled, and they needed to form a new team.

Ling Han rowed the wooden raft, and tapped the ground. Instantly, the wooden raft rode the winds and waves.

After travelling for a while, the rolling rock appeared.

Eldest Baby instantly became excited. She was a violent maniac, and her bones and blood were filled with a desire to destroy.

“Coming, coming!” she called out. Previously, she had already heard Ling Han explain about what to do, which made her eager to give it a try.

The toddlers all injected their Spiritual Power into the wooden raft. Ling Han didn’t stay idle either, and he distributed a portion of his Spiritual Power into the wooden raft.

Eldest Baby was responsible for controlling it, and with a childish cry, xiu, a ray of light shot out, and the rolling rock was immediately blown into pieces.

“It’s too simple,” Eldest Baby said. “Next time, we only need to insert 20% of our Spiritual Power.”

The other babies all nodded. They were mentally connected, and their Spiritual Power could be perfectly fused together. There were clearly only seven of them, but it was enough to unleash a might that was several times stronger than the ’ combined forces of ten others.

“Father, don’t interfere. You’ll only be hindering us,” Eldest Baby said to Ling Han.

‘Fine, I’ve been rejected.’

Ling Han sighed upon hearing this. ‘I’m still your father, after all. Can’t you give some face?’

He also knew that the coordination of the seven children was the best, so he did not make a move. Instead, he focused on controlling the wooden raft.

In a short while, the rolling rock appeared again.

Here’s more fun.” Eldest Baby cried out loudly, extremely excited.

Peng, the rolling rock immediately exploded.

A while later, a pair of rolling rocks appeared.

This was still no problem. Under Eldest Baby’s command, the wooden raft shot out two consecutive pillars of light, shattering the rolling rocks easily.

Previously, the seven kids had only injected 20% of their Spiritual Power respectively. Thus, after the first wave was expended, it was also very easy to inject more Seventh Baby.

After a very long time, another pair of rolling rocks attacked, and they too were easily destroyed.

At this time, the wooden raft that Ling Han was controlling had already surpassed the height of the first time he had climbed the mountain. After a few times of calm and undisturbed impact from the rolling rocks, a high difficulty test finally appeared. Three rolling rocks appeared at once, one after another. Hong long long, the ground was shaking from the impact.

“Come on, come on!” Eldest Baby was so excited that she was close to howling. Xiu, xiu, xiu, the wooden raft shot out three consecutive pillars of light, shattering all three big rocks.

“It’s too easy,” Third Baby said proudly.

Ling Han only smiled slightly. The seven babies were mentally connected, and with the natural Divine Physique, their Spiritual power had also improved at the same time, not inferior to his. Thus, the seven of them working together was enough to match the combined power of twenty or even thirty Enlightenment Tiers.

This was naturally easy.

The greatest difficulty was when four rolling rocks appearing at the same time, but they still could not pose any threat to the seven children, and were easily resolved.

When Eldest Baby was still feeling unsatisfied, this mountain path had already reached its end. When the wooden raft reached this point, it automatically disappeared. The eight of them leaped, and stood firmly on the ground.

This was already halfway up the mountain, but it was uncertain whether it was halfway up the mountain or not. After all, looking from here, this mountain was still too high to reach.

“We’re not done yet.” Eldest Baby sighed, then blinked her big eyes, “Father, let’s find a few people to fight.”

You little violent maniac, could you not think of fighting all day long?

Ling Han sighed. Thankfully, there was only one such violent maniac. Though the other children were also very troublesome, they were still much easier to manage than Eldest Baby.

He gazed into the distance. However, they were currently ascending the mountain, so even if he climbed to the top of a tree, he wouldn’t be able to see the entire situation. Thus, he quickly retracted his gaze. Next, he would have to take one step after another for the next stretch of the journey.

In theory, there were Divine Stones everywhere on this mountain, and whether one could find them or not was completely up to luck. However, it was said that some Divine Stones were hidden in various dangerous places, and could only be obtained through a battle of wits and courage.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This information came from ancient historical records. The Ethereal Peak hadn’t appeared for over 2000 years, and those who entered this time had only heard rumors about the situation. None of them were sure.

Ling Han and his seven children hastened on their journey, while he held the perverted pig in his hands. If they encountered danger, he could use it at any time to block a disaster.

The perverted pig was naturally displeased, and continued to moan incessantly. However, how could Ling Han possibly pay any heed to this? Where would he find such good armor?

There was a craggy mountain path here, and after walking for a while, Second

Baby suddenly called out, “Father!”

Ling Han immediately stopped in his tracks, “En?”

“The rock in front,” Second Baby said in a low voice.

Ling Han activated his eye technique and looked over. A very ordinary rock on the left side of the road in front of him immediately appeared slightly different, with slivers of blood and Qi rising from it.

Yi, this was actually a living creature?

If it wasn’t for Second Baby’s reminder, Ling Han definitely wouldn’t have used his eye technique to check it out. After all, activating his eye technique was a huge expense of energy, and he couldn’t possibly keep it activated forever.

If they just walked over without any preparations, and this creature suddenly attacked, what would be the result?

Ling Han took a closer look. This creature was a Mystery Realm Tier-level existence.

This… If he really ambushed Ling Han, he would definitely die!

But now!

Ling Han smiled, took out the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and began to compress its weight.

His current Spiritual Power had been greatly improved, and the Heavenly Pattern Jade was quickly compressed to about 1.1kg. Then, he threw it with all his might, and activated it with his Spiritual Power, instantly reaching 11 times the speed of sound, smashing towards that “rock”..
