2801 He Liqun blocked the city

Something happened to Ling City.

An elite had blocked the entrance, and no one was allowed to enter or exit the city.

One that even the Empress couldn’t handle?

Indeed she couldn’t handle it, because the person who came was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

!!

He Liqun.

It was nothing strange for him to appear. He had previously suffered a huge loss at the hands of Ling Han, and coupled with his son’s personal grudge, he was definitely not going to spare Ling Han.

Now that the crisis of Hysteria had been lifted, the restraints on the Heavenly Venerates no longer existed. Originally, they were united in stance towards an external enemy. Now that there was no need to confront the “external enemy,” the Heavenly Venerates ought to be fighting for their own personal grievances.

He Liqun had taken so long to come here because he hadn’t known where Ling Han had been before, but with the growth of Ling City, it was naturally impossible for it to become a secret anymore.

What surprised Ling Han was that He Liqun just blocked the entrance, and did not make a move.

“Ling Han, you have finally appeared.” He Liqun sneered. “I didn’t make a move, because I wanted you to taste the feeling of betrayal and isolation!”

He paused for a moment, and then reiterated, “Everyone, listen up! You are to leave Ling City within one month. Otherwise, in one month’s time, I will wipe out the entire Ling City with my own hands, and those who remain… shall die!”

It turned out this was his idea.

Ling Han really wanted to give him a piece of advice: that villains usually died because of talking too much, let alone when rambling on for a month.

“He Liqun, you truly are outstanding.” Ling Han shook his head, his tone full of disdain.

‘F*ck, what’s with your tone?’

Instantly, He Liqun had the urge to kill him, but when he thought of the humiliation Ling Han had brought to him and his son, he forcibly suppressed it. Simply killing Ling Han could not relieve him of his hatred; the latter had to be severely punished.

One month later, he would kill Ling Han who has completely lost all family and friends, and then extract the Heavenly Venerable Seals being held by the other party, and take them for his personal use.

He Liqun wasn’t worried that Ling Han’s strength would increase by leaps and bounds within this month, or that he might get reinforcements, because the entire Ling City had been sealed off, and it would be impossible for any news to be disseminated. He still had this much confidence in himself.

As long as Ling Han came back, he would be trapped.

“Ling Han, I will give you one month’s time to make arrangements for your funeral,” He Liqun said coldly, sitting cross-legged at the city gate while unleashing his powerful aura, which engulfed the entire Ling City.

He had done it on purpose. Under such a powerful aura, the people in Ling City would definitely tremble in fear, and their only thoughts would be to escape.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “Alright, we will battle again in a month’s time.”

He also wanted to see how many people would find it unbearable and flee the city. Ling City had no need for such disloyal people.

Ling Han entered the city as if nothing had happened, talking and laughing with his wives. Naturally, he had a plan in mind.

Firstly, he still possessed the letter that Chu Hao had left with him, and tearing it open would unleash a Fifth-Tier attack, which naturally could destroy a Fourth Tier with ease. Secondly, as long as Ling Han wasn’t in a chaotic place such as the Realm Battlefield, he could traverse freely through the Genesis World, and no one could stop him from doing so.

Hence, he truly wasn’t afraid of He Liqun, and it wasn’t impossible to kill the other party.

Day by day, He Liqun’s pressure seemed to have solidified. Indeed, this was the pressure emanating from a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, so strong that even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be trembling under such power and not be able to withstand it. Most of the folks in Ling City were merely ordinary people, so how could they bear it?

Naturally, the businessmen fled immediately. They had nothing to do with Ling City in the first place, so why would they stay?

Then, some families who were not firm in their will also began to evacuate. They firmly believed that Ling Han would be defeated, so they naturally didn’t want to go down with Ling City in defeat.

Ling Han didn’t stop them, as he really didn’t have the right to ask others to live and die together with him. However, these people needed not stay in Ling City in the future anymore, as they absolutely weren’t welcome.

As time passed day by day, the Feng Clan, Murong Clan, and Cheng Clan also showed hesitation. Of course, Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing were more than willing to advance and retreat with Ling Han, but their descendants did not have much of a connection with Ling Han.

When Ling Han was strong, they were willing to stick close to him and gain some glory, but once Ling Han was in a disadvantageous position, and even put them in a precarious situation, then they naturally would not want to die together with him.

At the beginning, they had hoped that Ling Han would pull out a trump card and blow up this external enemy. However, the one-month deadline was getting closer and closer, and yet Ling Han still didn’t make any movements, which naturally made them lose their patience.

They feared Ling Han’s vengeance, so they moved stealthily, and suddenly fled on a certain night.

Of course, a minority of people chose to stay; not everyone was ungrateful, after all. However, such people were really too few.

This was true even for those three major clans, not to mention the other smaller clans attached to them—they were completely gone.

All of Ling Han’s wives were extremely upset and angry, while Ling Dongxing and his wife were worried about their son, not knowing how they would all get through this catastrophe. Although Ling Han had comforted them, once the old couple knew that He Liqun was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, they really didn’t have much confidence in Ling Han.

When more than 20 days had passed, someone was heard shouting and cursing outside the city gate.

Zhu Xuan’er went to take a look, and when she came back, her pretty face was full of anger.

It turned out that the people cursing outside the city were those who had previously escaped from Ling City. They had become turncoats, and acted as if they were He Liqun’s subordinates; they were all acting high and mighty.

The Empress got so angry that she immediately wanted to go out and slaughter these ingrates, but was dissuaded by Ling Han. Anyway, there weren’t that many days left, and when the time came, they would just settle the matter once and for all.

“Husband, are you really confident?” All the women asked him one after another. After all, He Liqun was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and these four words alone carried such overwhelming pressure. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Han smiled confidently. “No problem.”

A few days later, there were more and more people cursing the city. Many of them were elites of the Ascending Origin Tier, so their influence was naturally vast and mighty, and their voices clearly spread to every crook and corner of the city.

Ling Han took a look from the top of the city, and couldn’t help saying, “I was wondering who might it be, and it turns out that He Yufeng has come.”

There wasn’t any cursing-the-city attack previously, so why did it start all of a sudden?

It was because previously there had been no He Yufeng, and now this guy had also arrived. He was probably the one who came up with such a terrible idea.

Very well, Ling Han would just kill both father and son together in the future.

Ling Han was very calm. He would just let the father and son pair be arrogant for a few more days so as to help him get rid of all those who weren’t loyal, giving Ling City a huge change.

One day, two days, three days, and finally the one-month deadline arrived.

“Ling Han, come out and die!” He Liqun said lightly, but his voice reverberated far and wide. He was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, powerful to the point of being indescribable.

Ling Han and the Empress came out hand in hand, standing on the city wall, while the other women followed behind. They were just Celestial Kings, and thus had to rely on Ling Han and the Empress to withstand the oppressive aura of the Fourth Tier.

“Ling Han, do you dare to fight?” He Yufeng jumped out with a serious gaze.

He had already advanced to the Second Tier, which could be said to be a rapid progress, thereby reigniting his confidence, and thinking that he would definitely be able to suppress Ling Han.

...

He Liqun originally wanted to stop him as he knew how far Ling Han’s true strength had reached, but after thinking about it again, he thought it would be good to let his son suffer just a little bit so as to motivate him and prevent him from being too complacent.

He was here, after all. As long as he could blast Ling Han to death, it wouldn’t matter even if his son was defeated. The knot in his heart would be untied soon.

Thinking of it this way, he didn’t advise against it.
