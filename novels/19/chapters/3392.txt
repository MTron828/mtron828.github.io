Chapter 3393: Decision

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

The situation was changing rapidly.

Previously, the Four Great Generals were all determined to fight. They would rather die than be dishonored. However, when the strength of the Demon Race was displayed, the Four Great Generals could not be unyielding no matter what.

If they fought, they would definitely lose. They might even lose their country. Yes, His Majesty’s strength was unfathomable, but the Holy Emperor was only one person after all. He could not split himself, so how could he match a whole country? Furthermore, the strength of the Emperor of the Demon Race might have reached an unimaginable level.

“Third brother, is the news true?” After a while, the Eighth Prince asked.

“I don’t want to believe it either, but the truth… is indeed so!” The Third Prince said.

“How can the Demon Race be so strong!” General Hengtian frowned.

“According to historical records, the Demon Race is born with a strong physique and a higher level of being than us humans. Therefore, in the early stage of cultivation, the overall strength of the Demon Race is much higher than that of us humans,” the Second Prince interrupted.

Hiss, the Four Great Generals gasped at the same time. Yang Bai’s expression was also solemn. He only knew that the Demon Race was very strong, but he definitely did not expect it to reach such a level.

Only Grand Tutor Hong revealed a look of joy. This way, Ling Han was dead meat.

The fate of the Dark North Nation?

He didn’t take it to heart. As long as Hong Tianbu could grow, not only would the Hong Clan rise again, but they would also in fact become a hundred or even a thousand times stronger.

The Second Prince had also said that the Demon Race only had the advantage in the early stages. However, as long as they embarked on the path of immortality, the human race would not be inferior.

Hong Tianbu was a freakish genius. It would definitely not be difficult for him to step onto the path of immortality.

“Looks like we can only hand Ling Han over,” Grand Tutor Hong said after pretending to ponder for a moment.

He believed that no one would be willing to take the initiative to make this suggestion. After all, they were showing too much weakness, and everyone wanted to save face. Thus, Grand Tutor Hong could only go in head-first. Who asked him to hate Ling Han the most?

That’s the only way.” General Vajra was the first to agree.

“Yes.” General Moon Eclipse nodded.

General Hengtian didn’t say anything, but he also nodded.

In this way, three of the Four Great Generals had already agreed to hand Ling Han over, representing that the military’s attitude had also changed from accepting the challenge to seeking peace.

Grand Tutor Hong was overjoyed. Now, Ling Han’s fate was set.

The Seventh Prince pondered for a moment and suddenly said, “We still need to consider this matter at length. I agree that it’s not appropriate to start a war, but Father has been valiant all his life and has never submitted for any reason.’ If we are afraid of a war, Father will definitely be furious when he comes out of seclusion.”

“That’s right.” The Third Prince nodded. “This means that the Dark North Nation has to bow down to the Demon Race. Father will not agree no matter what.”

F*ck, you were the one who said that the abilities of the Demon Race were too strong and that we were unmatched. Now, you’re the one who said that we can’t lower our heads—what exactly do you want?

“Then what do the two princes think we should do?” Grand Tutor Hong asked in a low voice. If the Seventh Prince was still in the Inscription Tier, he definitely wouldn’t be so polite, but now that the Seventh Prince had already stepped into the Enlightenment Tier, he had to be respectful.

In this world, strength represented everything.

“Delay, delay as much time as possible,” the Seventh Prince said. “Such an important matter must be personally decided by Father. Moreover, with this Prince’s understanding of Father, the probability of him deciding to fight is higher.”

Thinking of the domineering Holy Emperor, everyone could not help but nod. This was indeed in line with Chen Fengyan’s personality.

Grand Tutor Hong was anxious. This turn of events was too exciting. Why was it so difficult to kill a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator?

But what if we can’t delay until Father comes out of seclusion?” Chen Jingye asked. Although his status was not high, he was also a prince, so he had fewer scruples when he spoke.

The Demon Race gave us a deadline of nine days,” Yang Bai said.

Could Chen Fengyan come out of seclusion in nine days?

This possibility was close to zero.

The problem was that in order to prevent anyone from disturbing his cultivation, no one knew where he was in seclusion. It was impossible to wake him even if they wanted to.

Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what choice to make.

Ling Han nodded. The few elder princes were indeed extraordinary. Not to mention their abilities, just their courage alone was far beyond that of ordinary people. This was because even existences like the Four Great Generals would cower when they heard about the strength of the Demon Race.

“Then let’s wait for a while. We’ll make a decision the day before the Demon Race’s deadline arrives.” Yang Bai decided.

Grand Tutor Hong revealed a depressed expression. Even this was unable to nail Ling Han to death?

What kind of luck did this kid have?

Ling Han nodded at Grand Tutor Hong. He would remember this enmity, and the best way to take revenge was to surpass Hong Tianbu and crush the halo of this freakish genius. To Grand Tutor Hong, this was definitely worse than killing him.

On the other hand, Grand Tutor Hong sneered. He believed that this would only give Ling Han an additional eight days of freedom. At the end of the eighth day, everyone would discuss it again. In the end, they would definitely still hand Ling Han over.

The only variable was that the Holy Emperor would come out of seclusion within these eight days, but the possibility was slim. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ling Han walked out of the main hall, and saw that Gu Xiangming was actually still lying on the ground. He smiled, and walked past him.

Gu Xiangming’s eyes were spitting fire. Ling Han was leaving just like that?

He was the captain of the Imperial Guards. How could he be beaten up for nothing?

Where was the pride of the royal family?

However, no one cared about this now. If they were to hand Ling Han over, would they still need to fuss over such a small matter?

And if they didn’t hand him over, a bloody battle would be unavoidable. The Dark North Nation was very likely to be destroyed, so there was even less need to care.

Ling Han returned to his residence and acted as if nothing had happened, doing whatever he had to do.

Before long, someone came to visit.

The Seventh Prince, Chen Taiqing.

“Thank you, Your Highness, for your righteousness and frankness today.” Ling

Han first expressed his thanks.

The Seventh Prince waved his hand and said, “As a prince, how can I weaken the might of the country? Father has been domineering all his life. It’s impossible for him to submit to the tyranny of the Demon Race. Therefore, I’m only telling the truth.”

Ling Han was secretly impressed. To be honest, it was not a simple matter. Too many people had unknowingly said things that went against their conscience in the face of pressure and temptation.

It was easy to tell the truth a few times, but it was difficult to tell the truth for a whole lifetime.

“I still have to thank Your Highness,” he said.

The Seventh Prince nodded and said, “But the current situation is very serious. The Demon Race is indeed very strong, so strong that once a war breaks out, our Empire will definitely lose. However, this has nothing to do with you. The enemy is strong and we are weak. Sooner or later, the Demon Race will launch an invasion war.”

It was still this prince who saw things clearly. For example, Grand Tutor Hong only knew how to take revenge for his personal grudges, but he didn’t know that even if he handed Ling Han over, it would only be the prelude to the invasion of the Demon Race.

Yes, it wasn’t just the Seventh Prince. The Third Prince was the same. Those elder princes were all the same. They had guts and bearing. From the looks of it, any one of them who inherited the throne wouldn’t weaken the reputation of the Dark North Nation.

“If Father can’t come out of seclusion within nine days, then when the war breaks out, we must be prepared,” the Seventh Imperial Prince said, looking at Ling Han seriously.

“What preparations?” Ling Han asked..
