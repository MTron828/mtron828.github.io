Chapter 1178: Entering the Alchemy Room

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The leading horned tiger was a little puzzled.

He had only suppressed his ferocity and tried to persuade Ling Han and the others to leave because he was apprehensive of their strength. However, judging by the situation right now, these humans had simply come to seek death!

There were only two people who hadn’t joined the battle yet. However, one was a human who was clearly at the Mountain River Tier. Regardless of how powerful he was, his maximum cultivation level could only be at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. A streak of 10 tigers would be enough to deal with him. Meanwhile, the other person was an asinine puppet. Their influence on this battle would be even more negligible.

‘Was I being too cautious?’

The horned tiger felt that this was the case. They had killed and eaten countless humans during the past tens of thousands of years, and they had barely come across any hitch. Humans were indeed very weak.

He became far more at ease upon thinking of this, and he let out a long roar before shouting, “Brothers, attack!”

The dozens of remaining horned tigers roared in reply and instantly charged into battle.

Meng Wei and the others were plunged into an even more precarious situation.

“Handsome guy, hurry up and help us!” Meng Wei shouted.

“Brat, it seems like you’re the leader of these people,” the leading horned tiger said. He glared at Ling Han, and continued, “Very well. I’m the leader of the horned tigers, so let us battle, king to king!”

“Sure!” Ling Han said with a smile. He clenched his right hand into a fist and punched outward.

Boom!

Origin Power surged and Regulations fluctuated, forming a devastating beam of light.

Peng!

A wall was instantly obliterated. However, the power of Ling Han’s fist still hadn’t completely dissipated yet.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

A whopping 11 walls were obliterated. However, this wasn’t to say that the power of Ling Han’s fist had dissipated. In fact, the might of his fist had already surged out of the manor—there were no more walls for it to obliterate.

The beam of light quickly became a small dot in the distance. However, it left a trail of destruction in its wake, with the deep pits in the ground revealing its devastating might.

The environment in the Immortal Realm was extremely stable, and it was very difficult for cultivators at the Mountain River Tier to cause widespread damage. However, Ling Han had already reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, and his power was more so eight stars above his cultivation level. Thus, his destructive power was also becoming stronger by the day.

The leading horned tiger winced, cold sweat dripping down his forehead.

“I missed...” Ling Han muttered to himself. He then grinned, and said, “What did you say just then? You wanted to battle me, king to king?”

‘Battle my f*cking a*s!’

The leading horned tiger wanted to cry. ‘You’re just toying with me now!’

Ling Han’s strike had been terrifying, and even if the entire streak of tigers were to defend against it together, it was still extremely likely that they would be insta-killed.

He finally came to a realization. ‘These humans are indeed very ordinary—except for this man!’

“Stop the battle! Stop the battle!” he shouted frantically.

“It’s already too late,” Ling Han said. “I can’t wait to eat some tiger meat.”

He flicked his finger and instantly disposed of the leading horned tiger.

He had initially wanted to toy with the leading horned tiger for a little longer, but upon thinking of the alchemical pills and pill recipes that might be in the manor, he decided to deal with him as quickly as possible. If he allowed the battle to drag on for too long, who knew what unforeseen circumstances would arise.

These horned tigers killed and ate people, so why did he need to show them any mercy?

Sword Qi swept through the surroundings, and horned tigers fell to the ground dead wherever Ling Han passed. At the same time, he stored all of their corpses into his Black Tower. These were his spoils of battle, so of course he didn’t need to share them with Meng Wei and the others.

“This is so easy! Riding on someone’s coattail feels so good!” Meng Wei and the others exclaimed.

They had initially thought that this would be a fierce and dangerous battle. However, it had ended up being extremely simple and relaxed.

Meng Wei led them into the depths of the manor. There was a secret room here, and it was protected with restrictions.

“The restrictions were a lot more complete when we discovered this place 100 years ago,” Meng Wei said. 100 years ago was when she had discovered this place using her unique technique and found that it was filled with alchemical pills.

“That streak of tigers probably resided here in the hopes of opening this secret room as well,” Ling Han speculated. After reaching the Immortal level, the cultivation path of Demonic Beasts was almost identical to that of humans. Thus, alchemical pills refined by humans were also useful to Demonic Beasts.

“Anyhow, the restriction here is still fairly powerful,” Ling Han said as he continued to study it. Although this restriction had already existed for a very long time, it still possessed an extraordinary might. If this hadn’t been the case, the large streak of tigers would have been able to crack it a long time ago.

“Handsome guy, can you crack this restriction?” Meng Wei asked.

“I’ll try,” Ling Han replied. He didn’t make any promises. He walked around the surroundings as he tried to gather a rough understanding of the restriction.

He quickly reached a conclusion. With his deduction abilities, he would be able to crack this restriction in around 10 years.

This would be an impossible task under normal circumstances. After all, this mystery realm would become extremely dangerous in half a year’s time. If outsiders didn’t leave, they would all be massacred. Where would he find 10 years?

However, Ling Han owned a Reincarnation Tree!

Using the fact that he needed to concentrate on studying the restriction as an excuse, he shooed Meng Wei and the others away. He then ordered the Asura Demon Emperor to guard the secret room. Meanwhile, he entered the Black Tower to complete comprehension under the Reincarnation Tree.

One day, two days, three days...

11 days passed, and a confident smile spread across Ling Han’s face.

He had spent an extra day as he had needed to frequently enter and exit the Black Tower. Observing and studying the restriction consumed a fair amount of time.

He called everyone over.

Meng Wei appeared quite astonished, and she exclaimed, “Handsome guy, you’re already able to crack the restriction?”

Only 11 days had passed!

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I can’t help it. I’m a genius, after all!”

Everyone chuckled upon hearing this. Ling Han wasn’t exaggerating. Being able to crack this restriction in 11 days was a freakish accomplishment—of course, this was under the condition that he succeeded.

Ling Han didn’t waste any time speaking. Instead, he continued to move around, making a few striking motions here, and another few striking motions there. It looked like he was pretending to be some mystical being. After watching him for a while, Hu Feiyun couldn’t help but yawn.

She had never been a patient person.

An hour passed, and everyone suddenly felt as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. However, they couldn’t see any visible difference in the surroundings. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’ve removed the restriction,” Ling Han said with a smile. He walked toward the room, and sure enough, he made it to the door without suffering a single attack.

He pushed the door of the secret room. It was a stone door, and it made a series of cracking and grinding sounds as it slowly swung inward.

Everyone’s eyes widened in eager anticipation.

The door opened, revealing the pitch-black of the room.

However, immortals naturally didn’t need light to be able to see clearly. They could see the rows of pill cabinets lining the room, all of which were filled with vials of pills.

“We’re rich! We’re rich!” Meng Wei and the others shouted in delight.

Ling Han was the first to enter, and the others all followed behind him.

“So many high-grade Divine Pills!”

“This is the Bone-grinding Pill, and it can increase the toughness of one’s bones.”

“The is the Thousand Crane Pill, and it can free one from the Regulations of heaven and earth for a short while, thereby allowing them to fly.”

“This is the Frost Pill, and it allows one to become immune to ice and snow element secret techniques for a short period of time!”

“Aaaah!”

They were all over the moon as they read the labels on the vials. However, Meng Wei suddenly wailed in anguish when she uncorked one of the vials.

“Leader, what’s wrong?”

“Leader, are you finally cracking because you couldn’t fulfill your desires the other day?”

Her underlings all started to tease her.

“T-the pills have already turned into dust!” There was a look of anguish on Meng Wei’s face.
