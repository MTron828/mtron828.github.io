Chapter 1759: The Medicinal Garden

Ling Han only felt his vision blur, and he had already arrived in a forest. Though there were some similarities with the previous scenery, there were even more differences.

The ground here was more yellowish, and the tree leaves were also wider and thicker, while their height was considerably lower, so sunlight could not penetrate the canopy.

Ling Han raised his head, and his vision passed through the layers of leaves. He could clearly see that there was actually a sun hanging above their heads!

It should be known that the Celestial Realm did not have any sun, and even the stars in the skies were not real stars, but merely multiple pieces of giant meteorites.

“Little Han, don’t glance around, and follow Grandpa Dog quickly.” The large black dog moved stealthily forwards. “Don’t create a slightest bit of noise.”

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Didn’t you say that this was an ancient site? We haven’t even gone in yet, so why should we have to be so cautious?”

“Pei, who told you that one can just simply strut right into an ancient site?” The large black dog did not even turn his head. “This ancient site has already been taken by someone, so we have to be very careful. Otherwise, we could not possibly enter.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Taken by whom?” Ling Han asked. This large black dog was indeed undependable. It had not spoken the truth, and had actually concealed such important information.

“Don’t worry about it. Anyways, we are here to commit robbery, so who cares whom we’re robbing!” the large black dog retorted very irresponsibly.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat, but when he thought about the fact that ancient sites had no owner in the first place, and it was not something that would belong to you just because you discovered it first, he nodded, his heart completely unburdened as he followed the large black dog’s footsteps.

After walking for a while, the large black dog suddenly spluttered into laughter, and said, “Brat, if Grandpa Dog farted at this moment, you’d be so extremely ‘invigorated’, wouldn’t you?”

Ling Han almost sent it a kick. “Little Black, your taste is really getting worse and worse.”

“Hehe, that would have to depend on the person. I think your taste is not all that good, either, brat.” The large black dog was not willing to be outdone.

They walked for a while, and the large black dog continuously sniffed around with his nose. When he arrived at some bushes, he moved the bushes aside, and there was actually a pit underneath. However, looking at its shape, it was definitely a dog’s hole.

Ling Han gave it a glance, and asked with a strange expression, “You aren’t asking me to squeeze into a dog’s hole, are you?”

“What’s wrong with a dog’s hole? Has a dog’s hole offended you?” The large black dog immediately flew into a rage, and opened his mouth to bite Ling Han. “Woof, you dare to look down on your Grandpa Dog?”

Ling Han drew out a chicken drumstick from his Spatial God Tool, and stuffed it into the large black dog’s mouth, blocking it in this way, and said, “Are you really reliable? Is there any such entrance into an ancient site?”

“Pei, the main entrance is heavily guarded, so what can we do if we don’t think of some alternative method?” The large black dog had chewed up the chicken drumstick completely in a few bites. “Do you have any more? Give me another.” He had gotten addicted to the taste.

“Let’s deal with business first!” Ling Han refused.

The large black dog took the lead, and squeezed into the dog’s hole. He had created this hole, so it was naturally just fitting to his size.

Ling Han was exasperated, and could only shrink his build, and began walking into the dog’s hole.

The dog’s tunnel was extraordinarily long, and this also showed that this ancient site was extremely important. The force that had taken possession of it was guarding it very seriously, and the large black dog had to open a secret passage from very far away.

After traveling for a whole two days, the large black dog finally stopped. The passage here had become considerably higher, so Ling Han could turn back to his original build, and would not need to worry that he would be squeezed.

The tunnel had reached its end, and a wall appeared ahead of them. It was very strange, and looked like a painting that was capable of moving. Its color was changing continuously.

“This is the protective formation of the ancient site, just see how I will unravel it,” the large black dog declared proudly. “I’m not boasting around here, but there is practically no formation that exists in this world that is capable of blocking Grandpa Dog!

“Come, give Grandpa Dog a hand.”

Ling Han was also slightly accomplished in the art of formations. Though he was not able to set up a Celestial level formation at the moment, he still had the insight. Just by looking at the large black dog’s proficient movements, he knew that his level of mastery over formations was indeed very high.

The reason why this damn dog had learned formations in the first place had to be so that it could break into the treasuries of others or something of the like!

Guard against fire, guard against thieves, and guard against the large black dog.

“Yi, brat, why are you looking at me like that?” The large black dog stared at Ling Han while his two front paws moved incessantly.

“Nothing much. I was just considering if I should build a secret chamber or treasury or something of the sort in my residence in future,” Ling Han said casually.

“Then just leave that up to Grandpa Dog. I guarantee that it will be the safest treasury in the world.” The large black dog was filled with self-confidence.

“It is safe even against you?” Ling Han asked.

“How could that be!” The large black dog scoffed. “I am the one to set up the formation, so how could it possibly be capable of blocking me?”

Ling Han sighed, and said, “The individual I primarily want to guard against is you!”

“Woof, you actually distrust me so much!” The large black dog opened his mouth, wanting to bite Ling Han. However, his paws were currently occupied, so the large black dog could only turn his head, yet he could not get near enough.

Weng, it was at this moment that an opening appeared in the formation of the ancient site, which looked like a vortex.

“Go in quickly!”

Ling Han and the large black dog scrambled in at the same time. Abruptly, Spiritual Qi that was indescribably dense enshrouded them, causing every single pore on Ling Han’s body to relax and expand.

They had appeared inside a medicinal garden, and there were various types of Godly medicine being planted in the many spiritual fields. The Spiritual Qi here was like an ocean. If anyone with a lower cultivation level had come in, he would probably explode from just inhaling a single breath here.

Ling Han let the Empress out. At present, they still needed to accumulate Origin Power. Though the importance of this had lessened, their Origin Power still could not be too weak, as it would not be able to support the high power of Regulations.

“Yo, beauty!” The large black dog waved a paw, but did not dare to be too insolent. No one could possibly relax completely in front of the Empress.

The Empress’s demeanor was too strong, too noble, and too poised.

The Empress ignored him directly, so the large black dog could only sheepishly scratch his behind.

“Though this is a medicinal garden, the highest grade of Godly medicine here is only Level 20 Godly medicine.” Ling Han swept an eye over the surroundings. With the present pickiness of his, he was already not satisfied with mere Saintly medicine. Instead, he wanted Celestial medicine.

“You need to have patience!” the large black dog exclaimed. “Do you think that Celestial medicines are just cabbages to be found anywhere? Even a Celestial King Tier-level force could not possibly grow them all over the mountains and wilds. It is already very impressive if there is over a dozen Celestial medicines.”

“Then what about here?” Ling Han asked.

“According to my estimation, there should be one or two, at least,” the large black dog deduced.

There was no difference in level of Celestial medicine. Their only difference was that they contained different Regulations. The most important differentiating factor was their age. The older their age, the more Regulations they could contain, and the more valuable they would naturally be.

As they walked, Ling Han did not turn his back, either; if he encountered matured medicinal ingredients, he would still take them into the Black Tower. Saintly medicines still had some use for him. At least they could help increase his accumulation of Origin Power. Though the increase would not be great, it was better than nothing.

This was not the only medicinal garden here. When they had swept through this one, they exited by climbing over the wall, heading towards the next medicinal garden. But when they had just climbed over the wall, they saw a middle-aged man was presently using a technique to expedite the growth of the medicinal ingredients.

All of a sudden, they were staring at each other, and there was an indescribable strangeness about the scene.
