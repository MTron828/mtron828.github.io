Chapter 2320 Spending exorbitantly

“Does your auctioner’s business have the means to purify Ancestral King blood?” Ling Han asked.

“No.” The elder shook his head, and then continued, “This is a secret technique, and is only grasped in the hands of a minority of forces. However, you need not be concerned. After all, there is not much Ancestral King blood in this world.”

True, what Ancestral King would be letting out blood out of boredom?

Yet Ling Han thought, ‘There are at least 100 Ancestral King corpses that can be used inside the Black Tower. Just what kind of astounding wealth is this?’

Moreover, Ling Han had no plans on selling the Ancestral King blood. Instead, he would retain it for his own use. In that case, he naturally wanted even more to obtain the method of refinement. “Do you plan to trade this bottle of Ancestral King blood for Star Stones, or to trade it for another item?” the elder asked. “If it is the former, we will collect 15% as service charge. If it is the latter, you have to pay us 100,000 Star Stones.”

“The latter,” Ling Han answered, and directly tossed over a Spatial God Tool. Then, he took out some Star Stones, and it just happened he had 100,000 left.

“Then what do you want to trade for?” the elder asked. He naturally hoped that Ling Han would choose the former option. The value of a portion of Ancestral King was definitely 100,000,000 Star Stones or above.

Ling Han did not hesitate, and answered, “The method to refine Ancestral King blood.”

The elder was surprised. He had already spoken very clearly, yet why was Ling Han still so dead set on it? With a thought, he couldn’t help but inhale sharply, and exclaim, “You do not just have one portion of Ancestral King blood!” This number was definitely not small. Otherwise, even if you traded it for the method of refinement, so what? The increase in value would not be more than this portion of Ancestral King blood presently, and it would still be a loss.

‘Do you have an Ancestral King in your family that can let out some blood any time you like?’

Though he was thinking this in his heart, the elder naturally would not be asking it out loud. A businessman should never be too curious. However, he still said something additional. “If you have more Ancestral King blood, you can delegate us to help you sell it off. If there is a lot, our service charges can be further lowered.

“Furthermore, for our auction house, all personal information is definitely classified, and there is no need to worry about any trouble.”

Ling Han merely smiled in response. Firstly, he really had too much Ancestral King blood, and there was no way he would take it all out to be auctioned off, and secondly, how could he possibly trust someone else so easily? Oh, it would absolutely be classified just because they said it would be classified information?

Of course, he had disguised himself presently, and actually did not fear that anyone would know that the Ancestral King blood had come from him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Most importantly, he, too, indeed needed Ancestral King blood-the Empress and the others also needed to use it, and he would not be complaining no matter how much he had.

The elder tried to persuade him further, but Ling Han had completely no intention of changing his mind. However, he did leave some room for negotiation. If this deal was successfully and smoothly completed, who knew, he could have a second portion of Ancestral King blood to be auctioned off here.

After everything was settled, Ling Han was invited to a private room. Though a deal of 100,000 Star Stones was indeed not much for the auction house, it could not be helped, as what Ling Han had offered was much too valuable. Thus, he was also given the VIP treatment.

The inside of the auction building used Regulations of Space, and was another world entirely. Its structure was no different than that of any other auction building, but its size was over 100 times that of an ordinary auction building, and it could accommodate millions of people. Ling Han sat in a private room, and his visibility was extremely good, showing the high regard that the auction house had for him.

Not too long later, the auction officially began.

Wally regained human form, and sat beside Ling Han. He had just awakened intelligence, and was in the state of swift learning. However, what he previously learned was the knowledge of a high-level dimension, while now he was learning how to be human. He was entranced. According to him, he could start a certain mode, so he could simultaneously capture the voices and expressions of everyone in the area, and then analyze and calculate for his learning purposes. Meanwhile, Ling Han placed his attention on the items on auction. He could not be bothered with this curious child any longer.

At the beginning, the auction items were very ordinary. As Ling Han watched and listened, he couldn’t help but yawn, right until a celestial medicine appeared, and only then did he become energized.

Though it was not very old in age, it was still a celestial medicine, so it was still extremely valuable, and could be used in medicine and alchemy.

Ling Han naturally moved. He was definitely very rich. He had the wealth of over 100 Ancestral Kings. Though those Ancestral Kings could not possibly carry all their wealth with them, just a small portion was wealth equivalent to that of an entire nation.

As long as it was a celestial medicine, he did not care how old it was, or what kind of alchemical pill he could use it for. There was only one word for it: buy, buy, buy.

Seeing him spending so exorbitantly, the people below and those in other private rooms cast frequent glances at him, seemingly wanting to find out who the wealthy man in this private room was.

Ling Han’s mischievous heart was stirred up. With a thought, he immediately assumed You Yuan’s appearance, and then shut off the formation in the private room. It could form a barrier that prevented the divine sense of others from penetrating. Of course, mere sight could not penetrate through, either. Instantly, his appearance was displayed in front of the masses. “Yi?” You Yuan was also extremely curious about this mysterious person. However, he did not turn around repeatedly. Instead, he only turned around for a look when others exclaimed aloud.

Then, he was profoundly surprised. This person actually looked exactly like him.

However, he was not too concerned, either. The Foreign Realm was too large, and had too many people. It was no rare event that two people would look similar.

“How arrogant.” Someone smirked coldly. He disliked seeing how Ling Han spent so exorbitantly, as if he was better than everyone else.

“Hehe, one should never show off wealth. Does he plan to have someone rob him?”

“Haha, I say, everyone, let us not make competing bids. Later, we only have to rob this guy.” Ling Han laughed, his expression very arrogant. “If you want to rob me, just take a look at what kind of person you guys are yourselves, and estimate your own strength! Also, if you can’t find me, just go ahead and come to Hundred Battles Academy. My name is You Yuan.”

Pu!

You Yuan almost spat out a mouthful of blood. To say that this person was also named You Yuan was a coincidence, but if he was also at the Hundred Battles Academy, that would be wrong. There was only one You Yuan in the academy, and that was he, who was previously the only Monarch Star there.

Did he have some grudge with this guy that the latter would actually lay a trap for him?

To say nothing of him, even Yuan and Qi Shuang frowned.

This person had bought a great many celestial medicines in a single stroke. This astonishing wealth would naturally induce envy from others, and now he was deliberately impersonating You Yuan. Who knew how much trouble that could cause to their team.

This guy was really too snarky, deliberately opening the barrier to expose a false identity. What he wanted was to draw the waters of calamity to another target.

After Ling Han had shown enough of his arrogance, he unlocked the formation again.

Wally looked on curiously. He surpassed a great scholar who knew how many times in the grasping of knowledge, but on the matter of underhanded schemes, he was completely a layman, and could not understand why Ling Han had done so.

His understanding of worldly matters originated from calculation, and what had happened now was something that he could not obtain a result for no matter how hard he calculated.

The auction continued, and after a whole five days, it finally came to the stage of the most valuable item.

“Everyone has waited long.” The auctioneer pressed his hands down. “Originally, we only had one portion of Ancestral King blood for sale, but because of some special conditions, we now have another.”

Everyone heard this, and all looked excited. Now, there were two portions of Ancestral King blood. “However…” The auctioneer paused. “The second portion of Ancestral King blood has not been refined.”
