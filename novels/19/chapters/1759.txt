Chapter 1760: Seven Lives Divine Clouds

Ling Han’s eyes were sharp and his hands moved quickly. Pa, he had knocked that person unconscious with a single palm strike.

He looked towards the large black dog, and said, “Damn dog, I have indeed fallen for your trap again. This is no ancient site; it clearly is the medicinal garden belonging to a major sect!”

That person who had been knocked unconscious was clearly a herb farmer. Just now, Ling Han had clearly seen that he was using some kind of technique to extract the Regulations of heaven and earth to embed into the medicinal ingredients.

The large black dog’s eyes spun quickly. He soon threw everything to the winds, and admitted, “You are smart, brat. You have discovered it so quickly, Grandpa Dog is impressed.”

Ling Han was speechless. This damn dog was completely keeping silent about the major crime while admitting a smaller offense.

“We are already here. Furthermore, you have already gotten quite a considerable amount of spoils in you pockets, so it would be too late even if you wanted to stop now.” Going by the large black dog’s tone, he was already dragged into the matter, so there was no need to pretend innocence. “Come on, let’s go find the Celestial medicine.”

Ling Han sighed. He thought that he was really weak-willed as his heart actually felt restless because of such a suggestion.

“Come on!” he said. Just like the large black dog had said, he was already in too deep. Then, he’d just play the role of robber this time round.

The Empress, meanwhile, was completely unconcerned. In her philosophy, everything in the world was hers, and Ling Han was her man, so what couldn’t he take for his own?

They continued onwards, and continued harvesting medicinal ingredients on their way. They encountered a few more herb farmers along the way, and Ling Han knocked them all out before drawing them into the Black Tower. When they left later, he would release them.

Two days later, they were just walking on the path when xiu, a white figure streaked past their eyes at an incredibly fast speed.

Ling Han’s eyes followed that passing streak, and saw that it was a small deer. It was no taller than three inches, and was really pitifully tiny. And this deer was actually the color of flesh, being practically invisible. He could clearly see through into its body, but there were no organs. instead, there was a seed.

“Seven Lives Divine Clouds!” Ling Han suddenly called out.

This tiny deer was not a real deer, but was rather a Godly medicine called Seven Lives Divine Clouds!

From birth, it had to undergo seven transformations, and it would assume a different appearance every time. For example, it now had the appearance of a deer. In different appearances, the Regulations it contained would be completely different. It could be considered an extraordinarily amazing Celestial medicine.

The Seven Lives Divine Clouds would be considered mature once it entered the first form, and could completely be harvested and consumed. However, in different forms, the Regulations that one could obtain would also be completely different. He did not know the exact details; this was related to the environment that this Celestial medicine was growing in.

...Because this Celestial medicine had legs, and could run anywhere it liked!

The tiny deer also turned around to look at Ling Han. Then, it suddenly opened its mouth, and said, “Damn brat, why are you looking at your Grandpa Deer like that? Be careful, or Grandpa Deer will you!”

This...!

Ling Han felt like he was about to cry. Why were all the creatures and events he encountered so abnormal?

Some unknown change would take place in any ancient sites for no reason, and now he had encountered a Celestial medicine that would actually spout crude words at him.

“Celestial medicine, obediently come to Grandpa Dog’s mouth!” The large black dog’s eyes lit up, and he pounced towards the Seven Lives Divine Clouds.

“Damn dog, you have not rinsed your mouth for a few million years, and your Grandpa Deer is about to die from the stink of your breath!” The tiny deer’s expression was filled with disgust. Its legs broke out into a run, and it immediately ran away rapidly.

Ling Han, the Empress, and the large black dog all hurriedly set off in pursuit.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. They were all moving at very fast speed as well. Ling Han and the Empress had both cultivated Lightning Flash—the speed of this technique was naturally high. Needless to say, the large black dog was even faster as it was specialized in instant teleportation. In the past, when it had still been in the Genesis Tier, it had moved so fast that even a fourth severance grand elder could not manage to catch up to it.

But even so, they were not able to catch up to the tiny deer.

This Celestial medicine was very amazing. Wherever it galloped past, a great number of vines would sprout from the ground, and try to entwine Ling Han and his group, causing them a certain amount of trouble for them.

Just a moment of delay was enough for this Celestial medicine to maintain a specific distance between itself and Ling Han and his group with its speed.

“Bunch of trash, and you still want to eat your Grandpa Deer? You had best eat your Grandpa Deer’s dust instead!” That tiny deer turned around its head to mock them as it ran, its expression incredibly arrogant.

The Empress was furious, and she launched an attack with a wave of her slender hand. Flashes of Sword Qi instantly danced out, slicing the heavens and striking the earth. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

That Celestial medicine was so scared that it sprayed out a few drops of fluid, and its white face had already turned green in terror.

When others encountered a Celestial medicine like it, they all tried their best to catch it, but did not dare do anything else. That was because it was a Celestial medicine. No matter what kind of injury it suffered, that was an incredibly colossal loss.

With this kind of psyche added with its various tricks, it was able to mix around very easily here even though it had long since matured. Only when it encountered a few super elites did it have to let out some “blood”, but they could not bear to devour it completely.

But this woman was too “lacking in tender feelings”, and looked like she was about to beat it to death, scaring it so much that it sprayed out a few drops of celestial fluid.

‘Gods, really scared me to death.’

Ling Han’s eyes were sharp and his hands were quick. With a scoop, he had drawn those several drops of celestial fluid into a jade bottle. His expression was a little strange. This was indeed the treasure fluid from the body of a Celestial medicine, but the problem was it had been sprayed out from the tiny deer’s behind just now. Thinking of this scene, it would definitely become a psychological nightmare for him when he consumed it.

He was puzzled. Why did he keep encountering all these strange creatures and events?

“Surrender! I surrender!” the tiny deer wailed. “Don’t chase Grandpa Deer anymore. If you guys want Celestial medicine, Grandpa Deer will give you a little, all right? Please don’t kill Grandpa Deer!”

It was very scared of death.

Ling Han suddenly came upon an idea, and said, “We won’t harm you. Why don’t you follow us? I have a medicinal garden, and I guarantee you will love it.”

“You don’t look like a good person at all. Wanting to fool your Grandpa Deer, you are still a few thousand years too young!” The tiny deer’s expression was filled with disgust.

“En?” The Empress’s expression turned cold, and she raised her slender hand.

“Love it, of course I will love it!” The tiny deer’s expression was immediately filled with determination, looking as if it would become angry if anyone dared to make it feel dislike.

Ling Han couldn’t help but look towards the large black dog, and asked, “Is this a relative of yours?”

The large black dog scratched his behind. “Looks like it!”

“Looks like your sister, your Grandpa Deer does not have any relatives as ugly as you. Just look, your teeth are showing already, how hideous!” The tiny deer’s skill at drawing aggression was also top-notch, and it began to provoke the large black dog.

“Wayaya, Grandpa Dog is going to devour this guy!” The large black dog bared his teeth. “Don’t stop your Grandpa Dog!” If it were not for Ling Han pulling him back by his tail, the dog would definitely have charged over by now.

“Stop playing around.” Ling Han drew the Seven Lives Divine Clouds into the Black Tower.

“Ah, Ancestor!” The moment the tiny deer set eyes on the Reincarnation Tree, it suddenly paled in shock, and galloped over to the roots of the tree. It raised its head and rubbed against it. After a while, it couldn’t help but feel puzzled. “That’s not right, this mother tree has clearly already matured, but why has it not gained intelligence yet? It seems like it has only lived a few centuries.”

It had really not guessed wrongly. The Reincarnation Tree had had its growth expedited to maturity by a secret technique of Small Tower. From a seed until this present condition, its true age was actually even less than Ling Han’s.

Yet Ling Han was shocked, and couldn’t help but ask Small Tower, “The Reincarnation Tree is also a life force of the heaven and earth?”
