Chapter 2511: Reappearance of Battle Armor

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, as Ling Han and the others ran forward, many more people were retreating, with their faces as pale as a sheet.

This was because the two Celestial Kings had already started to clash.

Most of the people here were at the Ascending Origin Tier, while some of them hadn’t even reached this level yet. Thus, just a small shock wave from this battle could end their lives.

Fortunately, the two Celestial Kings quickly took their battle into the sky.

Boom, boom, boom!

Deafening thuds continued to travel over from the sky. Most people couldn’t see the battle at all, and they could only tell that the battle was extremely intense.

However, Ling Han could see everything clearly. Doka was a blond man with a hooked nose and sunken blue eyes. He was tall and sturdy, and he was extremely skilled with his legs. With a single kick, he could unleash the power of the Regulations of Water, triggering a boundless tidal surge.

Meanwhile, Yang Zhixuan had black hair and black eyes, and his figure wasn’t especially sturdy. Instead, he was tall and slender, and he wore a cold and aloof expression. He continued to lash out with his palms, easily slicing apart the tidal waves unleashed by his opponent. He was completely unafraid of this disciple from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

Both the Celestial Kings were extremely powerful, exchanging blow after blow. They both wanted to suppress their opponent. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, the fact that Doka was a proper disciple while Yang Zhixuan was only a follower signified that there was indeed a gap in their aptitude.

Doka was naturally more powerful!

Thus, in a battle at the same cultivation level, it was naturally the person who was more talented who would achieve victory. This was without a doubt.

Even though Doka had only just advanced to the Second Heaven, he was a monarch tier, so his Vitality Index had directly soared to 6600. Meanwhile, even though Yang Zhixuan had already reached the peak stage of the Second Heaven long ago, his Vitality Index was only around 6500. Perhaps it was slightly higher than this, but it was definitely not as high as Doka’s.

......

After battling for several hours, it was clear that Yang Zhixuan had fallen into a disadvantage.

“Yang Zhixuan is about to lose,” someone remarked calmly. This was one of the few people who could observe the battle in the sky.

Their remark triggered many questions from those in the surroundings. After all, they couldn’t see anything, and were simply here for the atmosphere.

The person gave a brief description of the battle, and this caused many people to sigh with emotion.

“This is inevitable. After all, Lord Doka is a genuine disciple. Even though Lord Yang is also a Celestial King, he’s limited by his aptitude, after all. Against someone at the same cultivation level, he can only do so much.”

“Moreover, Lord Doka has only just advanced to the Second Heaven. Once he reaches the peak stage of the Second Heaven, Lord Yang will definitely be defeated within 100 exchanges.”

“He’s a monarch tier, after all. How many of them exist in the entire world?”

Meanwhile, Ling Han was simply here to enjoy the show. He also nodded in his mind upon hearing everyone’s remarks. Unless Yang Zhixuan had some trump card, he would definitely suffer a brutal defeat.

Weng!

There was a flash of purple, and it was as if another sun had materialized in the sky.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel astonished. He had just thought about Yang Zhixuan needing a trump card, and in the next moment, the other party had immediately unleashed a trump card!

Right now, Yang Zhixuan was covered in a suit of purple armor. However, this armor was far thicker and heavier than what Ling Han expected. Yang Zhixuan was originally only half a head taller than most ordinary people, yet he was more than three meters tall right now.

From this fact alone, one could imagine just how thick and sturdy his armor was.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Even though this suit of armor was extremely thick, it still appeared elegant and streamlined, with its surface polished and smooth. Moreover, it was decorated with numerous symbols that pulsated with the might of Celestial Kings.

A thought suddenly flashed through Ling Han’s mind.

“How unexpected! You actually possess a suit of Battle?Armor1!” Doka’s expression became solemn and serious. This type of armor was no ordinary armor. Instead, it was a powerful supportive tool produced by some dimension that had taken a “scientific” route of evolution.

Battle Armor was divided into several different tiers and types, with some targeting those at the Shattering Void Tier, some targeting those at the Genesis Tier, some targeting those at the Celestial King Tier, and so on. When a Celestial King wore such armor, they could increase their battle prowess by a significant amount.

Mm-hm, an extremely significant amount!

However, Celestial King Tier Battle Armor was extremely expensive, and the cost of maintaining it was also exorbitant. Thus, it was extremely difficult for Celestial Kings to possess such armor.

Upon wearing this Battle Armor, both the battle prowess and defensive ability of Yang Zhixuan would soar to a new height. Perhaps he could rival or even surpass Doka.

Of course, this was dependent on the Battle Armor’s grade and also its affinity with Yang Zhixuan.

“There’s still time for you to f*ck off!” Yang Zhixuan said in a haughty manner. Even though Doka was a disciple, and Yang Zhixuan was only a follower, the academy’s rules stated that it wouldn’t interfere as long as the cultivation levels of both parties were within two minor levels. Both sides could fight to their heart’s content, as long as the battle didn’t result in death.

Thus, the academy wouldn’t interfere or punish him even if he smashed Doka into a pulp.

Moreover, a proper disciple failing to defeat a measly follower? Would he have the face to complain to the academy?

Doka chuckled coldly. He had also experienced countless struggles and obstacles on his way to finally becoming a Celestial King. If he retreated in the face of a challenge, would he still have the face to refer to himself as a monarch tier?

“Trash who can only rely on external power, see how I dispose of you!” he roared as his aura of haughtiness also soared into the sky.

Boom!

The two powerful Celestial Kings clashed again. Yang Zhixuan’s Battle Armor shone with brilliance, and it was as if he had transformed into an orb of purple light. In fact, even his attacks were completely different from before. They carried a purple radiance that possessed an astonishing destructive ability.

Ling Han involuntarily clicked his tongue in wonder. The Dark Inverse Realm also possessed Battle Armor, and it had even created a War Soldier like Wally. It was extremely impressive.

By the looks of it, this kind of dimension wasn’t rare in the Genesis World. In fact, Battle Armor was quite common and prevalent, especially since it provided the user with impressive supportive capabilities. It could increase both one’s offensive capability and defensive capability at the same time.

Ling Han could see clearly, and it was obvious that this suit of Battle Armor hadn’t been forged from Divine Metal. Instead, it was forged from something equivalent to the Celestial Realm’s Nine-Star or 10-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. It could endure several attacks from Celestial Kings, yet in the end, it would still be shattered.

However, this purple Battle Armor surprisingly possessed a powerful regenerative ability. After receiving damage, it would immediately repair itself and become as good as new. It was as if it had never suffered any damage.

This was a detestable quality that prevented Doka from threatening Yang Zhixuan.

Ling Han pondered over the ways to destroy this Battle Armor in his mind. Firstly, one could use formidable strength to directly obliterate it, not giving it the opportunity to regenerate. Secondly, one could slowly exhaust its power.

Once the Battle Armor was exhausted of all its power, it naturally wouldn’t be able to regenerate anymore.

However, Doka didn’t possess the power to directly obliterate the Battle Armor. Moreover, after wearing the Battle Armor, Yang Zhixuan’s battle prowess also became superior to his, so how could he possibly exhaust the Battle Armor’s power?

It wasn’t long before Yang Zhixuan gained the upper hand, completely suppressing Doka.

Another hour passed, and Doka finally let out an enraged roar as he turned around to flee, leaving a brilliant trail of light in the sky.

Yang Zhixuan stood tall and proud. Even though he had relied on external power to defeat Doka, being able to defeat a proper disciple as a follower was already something to be proud of. This was an achievement of great glory.

He put away his Battle Armor and descended to the ground, instantly winning countless gazes of respect and reverence.

In this world, winners were grinners.

Following the conclusion of the battle, the gathered cultivators naturally dispersed as well. Some returned to sell goods at their stands, while others continued to stroll around and look for things to buy.

“If there comes a day when I can also possess such cultivation and power, and when I can also engage in such an impressive battle before everyone, just how amazing will that be!” Tang Chi said with emotion. His face was filled with yearning.

Xu Qiang roared with laughter. “You’ll be the person who was defeated?”

“Pei!” Tang Chi spat upon hearing this. However, he quickly sighed with emotion again, saying, “If I can become a Celestial King, what does it matter even if I’m ruthlessly defeated before everyone? I still yearn to become one.”
