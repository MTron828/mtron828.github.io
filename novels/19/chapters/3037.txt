3038 You Can’t Stop Me From Killing Whom I Want To Kill

Yan Wuyue was dumbstruck as he stared blankly at his father.

Who was this person that frightened his father to the point of hitting him?

Everyone else perked their ears up; they were just as curious about Ling Han’s identity.

“He’s Lord Ling, Ling Han!” Yan Shu said. He then slapped his son on the back of the head, and said, “Hurry up and greet Lord Ling!”

Before Yan Wuyue could react, Yan Shu was already bowing his head and cupping his fists, “Yan Shu humbly greets Lord Ling!”

Even though Heavenly Venerates were highly respected, Ling Han’s strength was so great that there was no alternative for Yan Shu, other than to be humble before him.

“I, I humbly greet Lord Ling!” Yan Wuyue also cupped his fists and called out in greeting.

“Insolent brat. Hurry up and kneel!” Yan Shu’s face was completely ashen with fear. ‘Who do you think you are?’

Yan Wuyue was unwilling to do so. Ling Han had humiliated him, and his father not only didn’t help to get justice for him, he even wanted him to greet Ling Han on his knees?

He was just a Heavenly Venerate. The Yan Clan had three of those.

Yan Shu turned to his son, and saw that he was being stubborn like a bull. He couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

‘You are courting death, and even possibly taking the entire Yan Clan with you.’

“Unfilial son. I told you to kneel. Did you not hear me?” He kicked Yan Wuyue on the back of his knees, causing the latter’s kneecaps to instantly shatter from the tremendous impact. His body then gave way and he knelt on the ground.

“Lord Ling, please forgive me!” Yan Shu said in a trembling voice.

Ling Han smiled coldly. “Your son wants to kill me!”

Yan Shu nearly couldn’t catch his breath, and he said, “He is a foolish child. On account of him being young and ignorant, please show him mercy this one time. I, I will apologize on his behalf!”

His knees buckled as he was about to kneel.

Ling Han raised his hand, stopping Yan Shu before he could kneel.

Yan Shu was a little glad. Could this mean Ling Han was willing to show them mercy?

“You didn’t offend me. There’s no need for you to kneel.” Ling Han said. He looked at Yan Shu, and added, “Why are you not at the Realm Battlefield?”

‘F*ck, aren’t you not there as well?’

Yan Shu kept these words to himself, of course. He frowned as he awkwardly tried to piece together a reason.

Why was he not there at the Realm Battlefield?

It was simply because many of the other Heavenly Venerates had lost their will to fight upon learning that Chong Yan and the other ultimate elites had left, and had quietly escaped.

After all, as long as the main battlefield wasn’t destroyed, the Profound Negative Realm would not truly crumble, and would be able to sustain itself for a very long time.

After some thought, he answered, “My strength is limited. Even if I stayed at the Realm Battlefield, I would not be of much assistance.”

“Is that so?” Ling Han chuckled, and didn’t question Yan Shu’s reasoning. After all, he himself was not at the Realm Battlefield, so he was in no position to judge others.

Moreover, given that Chong Yan and the other ultimate elites had left, how would it be possible to restrain others from doing so?

Ling Han then shifted his gaze back to Yan Wuyue. “Let’s make things clear. You didn’t offend me, so you don’t need to kneel. However, your son wants to kill me. That’s a different story.”

“My Lord!” Yan Shu’s expression quickly changed. Yan Wuyue was the most promising youth of their clan. In the future, he could become a Third Tier or even a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. As such, he carried the hopes of the entire Yan Clan. Else, they would not have sent him to cultivate here at Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment. The only reason they had done so had been to allow him to break through to even greater heights.

Yan Wuyue quickly got to his feet as well. As he could prop himself up with Source Power, it didn’t matter much even if his bones were broken.

“You’re too arrogant! My Yan Clan has three Heavenly Venerates!” He pointed at Ling Han, and continued, “Also, this is Lord Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment. How dare you act so brazen before Lord Chong Yan!”

Yan Shu fell silent. It was clear that Ling Han had already made up his mind to kill. How could he possibly convince him otherwise?

Furthermore, his son was right. This was Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment. Would he stand by and watch as Ling Han committed murder on his territory?

Ling Han completely ignored Yan Wuyue’s threats. He said, “You intended to kill me, and even took action. Against people like you, I’ve only ever had one method of dealing with them.”

A loud boom resounded as Ling Han raised his hand, and an endless amount of power condensed to form a massive hand, which came pressing down halfway from the mountainside, towards Yan Wuyue.

“Ling Han, how dare you try to murder someone in front of me!” Chong Yan’s voice echoed from the top of the mountain. However, before his voice had even reached Ling Han, his giant hand arrived just in time to stop Ling Han’s own giant hand from pressing downwards.

Boom! Heaven and earth shook violently as the space crumbled like broken glass. Even the Void was easily ripped open, causing a storm of turbulent energy to whip forth.

In a battle between Seventh Tiers, even a casual exchange of blows was incomparably terrifying.

Yan Wuyue was overjoyed. Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan really came to save him!

However, Yan Shu was more terrified than before as he saw that Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan was only able to dispel Ling Han’s attack, and could not kill the latter.

What would happen if Ling Han was to bear a grudge against them?

How would their family be able to withstand the wrath of someone with Seventh-Tier battle prowess?

Could they get Chong Yan to protect their clan forever? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That would be nothing more than wishful thinking!

Ling Han gave a light chuckle. He didn’t care that his attack was dispelled, and simply said, “If I want to kill someone, not even you can save them!”

“Insolent boy!” Chong Yan rushed over from afar, his body surrounded by a domineering aura.

With a high-pitched whistle, Ling Han charged forward and met Chong Yan head-on. Boom! He channeled all sixth-grade seals and boosted his strength by 3,000 times before delivering a punch towards Chong Yan.

“It’s useless!” Chong Yan scoffed. No amount of strength, no matter how great, was able to wound him.

Weng! Under the massive impact of the punch, he was sent flying. However, because a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate was immortal and his body indestructible, such a blow wasn’t able to inflict harm upon him at all.

That being said, he was soon caught by surprise as he noticed that his surroundings had suddenly become pitch-black; he was being sent into the Void.

‘F*ck!’

He only managed to exclaim inwardly as he realized that Ling Han had been planning to knock him into the Void all along to trap him there temporarily.

Unbeknownst to him, Ling Han had opened a rift in the Void and sent him inside.

Standing before the crevice to the Void, Ling Han waved at Chong Yan. “Have fun in there, you old fool!”

He then sealed the rift.

This wouldn’t hold Chong Yan for long, but how much time would Ling Han actually need?

Ling Han turned back to look at Yan Wuyue.

Yan Wuyue was trembling in fear. He had never imagined things would turn out this way.

Not even an ultimate elite of Seventh Tier was able to suppress Ling Han?

It was over. Everything was all over.

The other Celestial Kings were also in shock. They never expected that not only was Yan Shu unable to suppress Ling Han, even Chong Yan couldn’t do it.

This… Was he also an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier?

“Please, please spare me, My Lord!” Yan Wuyue finally knelt down of his own accord. He didn’t think that he had actually offended an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier. Previously, when Ling Han had simply blasted him down the mountain instead of turning him into a bloody pulp, he had already been merciful.

Would his mistake be forgiven since he didn’t know any better?

What a joke. If the emperors of the mortal realm were to go on a casual walk outside and get ridiculed by others, would they laugh it off?

And if even mortal men were like so, then what more ultimate elites of the Seventh Tier? They were the true kings of the universe, an apex existence.

Ling Han just glanced at him coldly, and swiped his hand. Pa! Yan Wuyue instantly turned into a bloody mist.

If not for his overwhelming strength, should he have been kicked off the mountain by Yan Wuyue and killed by Yan Shu?
