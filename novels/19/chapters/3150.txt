3151 Thirteen overlapping layers of power

Ling Han thought for a moment, then took a few steps back. When he was three meters away, he then threw another punch.

On the sidelines, those five soldiers were already rendered speechless.

Why was it that after one had advanced into Ten Meridians, the hierarchy would become extremely clear?

It was very simple. A Twelve Meridians could strike their opponent from a distance of six meters away, but a Ten Meridians only had an attack range of three feet. To say nothing of the fact that there was a power gap in the first place, even if there wasn’t, with such a far distance, a Ten Meridians wouldn’t even have the chance to make a move, and would be directly blasted to the ground.

This new deputy captain… was definitely not human!

In the future, no matter what he said, they had to listen obediently. They definitely could not just obey on the surface but disregard him on the side just because his cultivation level was not high.

Ling Han retreated again, and after a few more attempts, he finally found out his limits. When he was about six meters away, his power would begin to decline. When he was about six meters and one foot away, his power would be practically zero.

In other words, whether it was in terms of power, or the distance he could release his power, he was not inferior to a Twelve Meridians.

Ling Han was brimming with confidence. Right now, even if he had to battle against Twelve Meridians elites like Meng Ruining and the other Twelve Meridians elites of the older generation, he would be unafraid and there was a 90% chance of winning.

He turned around, and saw that the five warriors from before were all gaping widely, looking at him as if they had seen a ghost.

Ling Han smiled faintly at them before turning around to leave.

“F*ck, I’m about to go crazy!”

“Such a powerful Ten Meridians elite is practically a monster!”

“No, I want to be transferred to Captain Ling’s team.”

“I’ll apply too!”

The eyes of these five people lit up. If they followed an elite, they would also be able to benefit from it in future, especially when Ling Han was presently in a weak position. If they followed Ling Han, they would be Ling Han’s loyal subjects, veteran brothers, and veteran subordinates!

Putting them aside, after returning to his own private room, Ling Han began to study compounding overlapping layers of power.

The Four Directional Fists also had overlapping power, but from the three moves that Sun Jianfang had taught him, it could only overlap two layers of power, which barely counted.

However, among the fist techniques of Brother Monkey Fist Technique, the highest power overlap could reach 180 layers.

Ling Han believed that if he really reached such a profound cultivation level, he would be able to crush a Blood Transformation Tier elite into dust with a single punch.

Ling Han thought internally. Those 180 overlapping layers of power were only theoretically the maximum value. There was an extremely high requirement for the cultivator himself. The first requirement was comprehension. Ling Han did not lack this, but he also needed his physique to keep up, and his power to keep up.

Otherwise, if he shot out a punch of 180 overlapping layers of power, his body would first explode, or his strength would be completely unable to keep up, and he would not be able to hold up after shooting out a few dozen overlapping layers of power.

“This way!”

“No, it should be this way!”

“En, that’s not right either!”

Ling Han very quickly left his private room. He disembarked from the battle ship, and found an empty spot to practice in a dense forest.

Demonic Monkey Fists was extremely important, so it was best not to let outsiders know.

He practiced over and over again. If he wanted to use overlapping layers of power, he would have to allow the power in his body to quickly be spat out. There was practically no interval, and only then would he be able to unleash more than a single overlapping layer of power with a single strike.

The faster the speed at which he spat out power, the more layers there would be overlapping.

Ling Han controlled his power and didn’t unleash his full power. Otherwise, the power in his body wouldn’t be able to withstand such extravagant use.

Moreover, if it really came down to a random barrage, this dense forest would also be destroyed by him. At present, the power he could release had reached about six meters, and there was absolutely no need for him to draw close at all. The force of over 45,000kg would already be crushing down on his opponent. This was too terrifying.

Peng!

He had already cultivated to the point of forgetting everything. All of a sudden, a rock exploded, waking him up from the state of practicing fist techniques.

“Eh?”

“I clearly only used 1500kg of strength in this punch. Logically speaking, it should be impossible for me to shatter a rock.”

“Unless—”

“I’ve cultivated the power of overlap!”

Ling Han was pleasantly surprised. He carefully recalled the scene just now, then his arms slowly moved. He suddenly threw a punch. Peng, another rock was shattered by him.

As expected!

Ling Han broke into a smile. He had grasped the power of overlap.

Two overlapping layers of power.

Taking the first step was the most difficult. Next, it would be the problem of overlapping more layers of power, which would completely depend on the rate at which power surged.

Three layers, four layers, five layers… nine overlapping layers of power!

Ling Han soon reached his current limit. Nine overlapping layers of power superimposed, and then his surge of power couldn’t keep up any longer.

“My body doesn’t feel any pressure, and my meridians don’t feel any pressure either. This means that it is only my power that can’t keep up, but my body hasn’t reached its limit.”

“Let’s try channeling the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique again?”

Ling Han channeled the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, before launching another punch.

As expected, the speed at which his power surged had increased considerably.

“It can still be improved.”

Tenth layer… eleventh layer… twelveth layer… thirteenth layer.

Ling Han had once again reached his limit, and could not improve any further.

“Furthermore, Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique can only be channeled for about a minute. Once I surpass this limit, my meridians will be greatly suppressed, as I will feel as if they’re about to explode.”

“Thus, under normal circumstances, the overlap of my power would be nine layers, and under a burst of explosive power, it would be thirteen layers.”

“For example, Wang Feng and the others can only attack with five overlapping layers of power. Even if I don’t explode, nine overlapping layers of power will still be enough to suppress them.”

“However, there’s no benefit in being too high-profile. I’ll hide my strength; it’s fine as long as I can win.”

He, who kept a low profile, was actually very proud. Just look, against an elite of Twelve Meridians, his prerequisite was still “winning”.

“I’ll ask that Banner Lord Lian if she has any cultivation technique to increase spiritual power. I should start practicing formations.”

Ling Han went to look for Lian Xuerong again.

“Have you advanced into Ten Meridians?” Lian Xuerong allowed him to enter into her ” boudoir”. Even though this was a battle ship, her room was not plain and simple in the slightest. She had everything a woman should have, and even had a dressing table.

Tsk, this cold-faced woman knew how to dress herself up?

Ling Han mocked internally, while replying, “Yes.”

If one couldn’t advance from the Nine Meridians to the Ten Meridians after ingesting the Volcanic Fruit, then one could only say that they were too weak.

Lian Xuerong didn’t find it strange either. She knocked on the table, and said, “Five people applied to be transferred to your team.” She paused, and said with a faint smile, “What spell did you put them under?”

She knew that her appointment of Ling Han as deputy captain had actually made many people dissatisfied, especially some veteran soldiers. They had all been in Xuanqing Banner for seven to eight years, but they were still just ordinary soldiers. A young brat who previously only had Nine Meridians was suddenly promoted to deputy captain, so how could they be satisfied?

But now, there were actually five people who actively wanted to follow Ling Han, and three of them were veteran soldiers. This made her feel curious.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Er, I have always used virtue to convince others. Perhaps, when they saw my noble character, they admired me from the depths of their hearts, and that was why they chose to follow me.”

Just keep talking nonsense!

Lian Xuerong rolled her eyes.
