Chapter 2607: Unstoppable

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Had Ling Han been under normal circumstances, Miao Hua would never have been able to ambush him, as the latter would have discovered the former’s presence in advance.

However, the current circumstances were unusual because Ling Han was running with great haste and more focused on Gu Heyi who was tailing him, resulting in his divine sense falling short of optimum condition as would have been under normal circumstances. Furthermore, Miao Hua had completely suppressed his aura for the sake of this ambush. Naturally, it was impossible to effectively guard against it.

Ling Han only reacted when the staff swept towards him.

At this time, it was already too late to turn his body around or even parry. Ling Han humphed as he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and golden seals immediately appeared on his body.

Peng!

Violently struck by the staff, Ling Han was predictably sent flying and slammed heavily against the wall. Under the impact of the terrifying force, the surface of the wall concaved, and the entire large tomb was shaking violently.

This strike from Miao Hua’s staff was so terrifying that even such a hard wall was ruptured. On the other hand, this also proved the sturdiness of the wall. The blast by someone with Eighth-Heaven battle prowess merely left a crater on the wall—this was truly unimaginable.

Ling Han groaned and continuously vomited blood. However, he didn’t hesitate, and dashed forward.

“Still thinking of escaping?” Miao Hua sneered. The power of his strike was already expended. Still, he loosened his left hand’s grip on the staff, and delivered a palm strike towards Ling Han.?Weng, weng, weng,?his palm kept getting larger and larger?

with each strike. Flames rose, instantly turning this place into a volcanic cave.

Ling Han’s clothing immediately caught fire. It was made of Celestial-King-Tier fur, but so what? It burned at a speed visible to the naked eye, revealing the skin underneath.

However, that was it. Ling Han’s hair was still jet black, with a crystalline sheen, and was not at all burned by the high temperature.

This was only natural, since his physique’s strength was at the level of Sixth Heaven. Had Miao Hua landed a palm strike directly on him, then even Ling Han’s physique would not have been able to bear it. However, this was merely a sliver of the flames Miao Hua surged out, so it was naturally impossible to hurt Ling Han.

Boom!?A palm strike was delivered with great momentum.

Ling Han let out a battle cry, and countered with a sword slash.?Shua, the sword light radiated gloriously.

Pu!

That big palm was immediately cut into halves—nothing could stand against the sharp edge of a Celestial Tool.

Miao Hua humphed coldly and withdrew his left hand, only to see a shallow wound dripping with blood on his palm. Fortunately, it was only injured by the Sword Qi, not directly slashed by the Celestial Tool. He channeled his cultivation technique, and the bleeding immediately ceased, and the wound was healed.

“Detestable guy!” Miao Hua gritted his teeth. Having been struck by his staff, Ling Han definitely should have sustained several broken bones and severe injuries to internal organs. Miao Hua didn’t expect Ling Han still had such powerful battle prowess to fight back furiously.

This kind of guy whose will to fight became stronger when the situation became more dangerous was absolutely annoying. Just like when facing a trapped tiger, Miao Hua could not be negligent, or it would be disastrous for him.

Xiu, Gu Heyi arrived at this moment, and the two looked at each other with surprised expressions.

Despite two great elites hunting him down, Ling Han still managed to escape. This young man was indeed outrageously freakish.

“After him!”

The two set out together, and chased after Ling Han. If Ling Han managed to get out from this large tomb, the area outside would be wide, and the fog would additionally make it difficult to see, which would then allow him to escape easily.

Therefore, Ling Han had to be taken down here.

“Ling Han, you are a prodigy of the martial academy with your name existing on the Eternal Stone. Don’t you even have the guts to have one battle?” Miao Hua said, naturally doing so to cause disturbance to Ling Han’s mindset.

Gu Heyi also said, “We promise to give you a fair chance to fight. Just pick one of us, and as long as you can endure 1,000 moves, we will never seek you again.”

Ling Han ran with great haste, a sneer at the corner of his mouth. Naturally, he could not believe even a single word from both of them. Fair? Had they been fair, then how could they have teamed up to snipe him, and even used a sneak attack?

“From this moment on, both of you should cherish every day, because there isn’t much time left for you guys!” Ling Han said coldly.

Gu Heyi and Miao Hua were furious. This brat was indeed too arrogant. Did he think that he was the only one making progress, while the two of them ceased to progress? Admittedly, Ling Han had more potential than them, but even if he was to surpass them, it was not a feat that could be achieved within a short period. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They were also a little puzzled. Since Miao Hua had already joined Gu Heyi, why hadn’t Xiao Yingxiong appeared yet? If Ling Han were allowed to run at this rate, he might escape.

But it was as if Xiao Yingxiong had completely vanished; he never appeared, allowing Ling Han to get out of the large tomb. Taking advantage of the fog, Ling Han escaped from the other two.

This made Miao Hua and Gu Heyi furious. They couldn’t help but scream out to the sky with such booming sound that its intensity even caused the surrounding fog to temporarily disperse.

At this moment, Xiao Yingxiong appeared.

“Why have you come so late?” Miao Hua and Gu Heyi demanded at the same time with extreme dissatisfaction.

Xiao Yingxiong’s eyes were somewhat glazed. His eyeballs were covered with a layer of black stuff. After a pause, his eyes immediately returned to clarity, and he said, “I found out something, so I was delayed.”

“What can be more important than taking down Ling Han?” Miao Hua humphed.

Xiao Yingxiong countered, “If we can crack the secret of that thing, it absolutely will not be any less valuable than Ling Han!”

“Oh?” Miao Hua’s and Gu Heyi’s eyes lit up at the same time. “Then let’s go take a look.”

***

Ling Han ran for a while before swiftly entering the Celestial Guest Residence again for healing.

Previously, he was almost stabbed in the heart by a Celestial spear, while this time he was struck by a Celestial staff. He had several broken bones, and his body was currently being destroyed by an acute murderous Qi.

“The level of Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll is still not sufficient. If I can advance it to the Indestructible Celestial King Physique, then it will not be so difficult to fight against a Celestial Tool, or if I can cultivate the indestructible Divine Metal Physique, then with a body akin to Divine Metal, there is no need to fear any Celestial Tool at all.”

Ling Han sighed deeply. However, after advancing the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to such a level, one would need a massive quantity of resources to progress a step further. Thinking about it, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had also cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll only after reaching the Heavenly Venerable Tier due to his limited strength. Where could Ling Han get such a quantity of resources?

It was already a miracle that his Indestructible Celestial King Physique was in fact superior to his own cultivation level now.

Another half a year had passed in real time, and Ling Han had completely healed the injury caused by the Celestial Tool.

“How did those three find me?” Ling Han pondered this question. He hid himself in Celestial Guest Residence for half a year without incident, but he was sniped as soon as he appeared. It seemed that the trio had a special way to locate him.

“Perhaps they planted something on me during the first battle, and even Heaven Deceiving Technique couldn’t cover my tracks. However, Celestial Guest Residence was made of Divine Metal, which surpassed their means. After all, their battle prowess is merely at the level of the Eighth Heaven.” Ling Han made such a hypothesis, but he nevertheless ran out without hesitation.

He had escaped from the overwhelming danger posed by the three elites, where his life had been on a thread and being bombarded by Celestial Tools. Despite it being extremely dangerous, it also made him gain comprehension continuously. He believed that he could completely strengthen his foundations this time, thereby getting ready to attempt the breakthrough to the Fifth Heaven.

He wanted to confirm his guess, and sat on the top of a large tomb to see if Miao Hua and the others would rush over swiftly.

Sure enough, within half a day’s time, three people came out of the fog. Who else could they be if not Miao Hua and company?
