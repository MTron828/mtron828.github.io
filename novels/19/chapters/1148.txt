Chapter 1149: The Rain Emperor Was Still Forceful

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Lan Luan’s cultivation level was at the peak of the low extreme of Mountain River Tier, but presently, the aura this blue-beaked bird was exuding had shockingly reached the medium extreme, and was even the late stage of the medium extreme. Her battle prowess was naturally even more frightening than before.

When everyone saw this, they were all astounded.

This was equivalent to boosting her battle prowess by a whole minor level!

The battle prowess of people like them would be capable of surpassing five stars, and with a boost of another minor level, the battle prowess would directly spike to nine stars. This was really too shocking.

However, to deliver this kind of attack, the strain on Lan Luan was also exceedingly heavy. Her beautiful face had turned completely pale, and there was blood seeping out from the corner of her lips. Her life essence had suddenly dropped greatly.

Perhaps delivering this attack would even shorten her lifespan itself. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This young girl really had a powerful competitive spirit. It was merely a spar, and she actually shortened her own lifespan. Even if she won, it would be damaging her opponent by paying the price of damage to herself.

Ding Ping rushed forward with a great shout, but the moment his fists came into contact with that blue-beaked bird, his whole person was sent flying out. With a bang, he collapsed onto the ground, and his hands were severely injured. His arms were completely bloody.

Lan Luan did not appear to be any better. She sat abruptly on the ground, covered by sweat, an air of weakness exuding from her.

If this blow of hers had not succeeded, then it would have been definitely impossible for her to deliver a second attack. She could only claim to have won narrowly.

However, Ding Ping had not used any powerful moves before he had been defeated by this powerful move which she had expended her life essence in return for. In truth, this was reasonable. After all, they were in the same cultivation level.

The Rain Emperor leaped out, grabbed Ding Ping, and brought him to stand beside the rock. He couldn’t help but shake his head.

Actually, he was more in favor of Ding Ping’s victory, but this guy seemed to have fallen for his opponent, and actually did not make any powerful moves, and chose to take her attack head on instead. Wasn’t this seeking his own defeat?

After he placed Ding Ping down, he strode down into the arena, and called out, “Who would battle with me?”

Though he had laid down his identity of an emperor, he had not abandoned the pride that belonged to one. In terms of bearing, there were really not many people here that could be a match for the Rain Emperor, though he was still only in the early stage of the medium extreme.

“Haha, I shall!” A young man wearing a green shirt leaped out. He was dressed completely in rich robes, and was also wearing a great number of ornaments. Furthermore, each of the ornaments he was wearing exuded a vague aura; they were definitely out of the common run.

This man either had to be a newly rich upstart or his clan was too noble if he was wearing so many accessories.

“That is Chao Xuan.”

“Chao? Someone from the Chao Clan?”

“That’s right; it is that Chao Clan.”

“Gasp!”

Chao Clan was a great clan, and had once produced a great elite of the Eternal River Tier very, very long ago, possessing supreme glory once. But when that great elite dispersed into Dao, the Chao Clan had no qualified successors to carry on their undertakings. As a result, they were naturally not as glorious as they once had been.

This Chao Xuan had ambition, and desired to revive the glory of his ancestors. Indeed, he was amazingly talented. However, he was too arrogant, thinking that not one person in this place could be his equal. ‘At most, all of you will only be capable of reaching the Heavenly Body Tier, but I am the one who will reach the Eternal River Tier!’

However, his cultivation level presently was still too weak, merely in the late stage of the medium extreme of Mountain River Tier. After all, he was too young, and had only cultivated for close to 100 years. Yet, he had managed to reach this level after a mere century; this was very impressive.

As his cultivation level increased, the Rain Emperor began to look younger and younger, but no matter how much younger, it was impossible that he would regain his looks from when he was in his teens and twenties. Presently, he looked to be about 27-28 years old, and among this group of young people, he appeared to be much older.

There was nothing to be done. In terms of actual age, the Rain Emperor was younger than the majority of them, but who asked him to have already been close to 60 years old when he finally stepped into the Flower Blossom Tier?

In everyone’s eyes, this was proof that the Rain Emperor lacked sufficient talent.

Wasn’t it?

For prodigies like them, who had broken through to the Flower Blossom Tier when they were merely seven or eight years old, their bodies would only grow, but would not age in the slightest. What did aging signify? That your cultivation level would not be able to keep up, and your life essence would be greatly lost. Otherwise, why would one have aged?

Chao Xuan bore a smile on his face, though he was internally disdainful. He was actually a seed just like this kind of trash; this was practically an insult to him!

Fine then, he would give this person a lesson. The best scenario would be that he could let the Rain Emperor withdraw from the sect of his own volition to avoid pulling his own standing as a seed.

“Here I come!” He had a very low opinion of Rain Emperor, and when he pressed down with his palm in attack, it was done very carelessly.

The Rain Emperor made his move. Hong, his forceful presence surged in all directions, his fists falling like rain.

‘What?!’

A shocked expression immediately appeared on Chao Xuan’s face; he had not thought that the Rain Emperor’s attack would be so fierce. He was indeed powerful, but he might not be stronger than the Rain Emperor. Hence, now that the Rain Emperor had taken the initiative, he was naturally forced into retreat, and could only defend himself against the incoming attacks.

How rich and abundant was the Rain Emperor’s battle experience? It could be claimed that if the two of them had the same cultivation level and trump cards, even Ling Han was not sure he could be able to defeat the Rain Emperor!

Now that he had the upper hand, his attacks were endless and pervasive.

Who could underestimate the Rain Emperor?

As someone who had broken through to the Mountain River Tier with 19 stars of strength, though he had not perfected his cultivation, one star of strength on Shattering Void Tier would have an influence of half a star at most in the Mountain River Tier. It would definitely not lead to a world of difference.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. The Rain Emperor continued his fury of attacks, and Chao Xuan was forced into retreat.

When he had taken his 17th step back, Chao Xuan spat out a mouthful of blood, and was sent flying with a single punch.

“Thanks for the win!” The Rain Emperor stopped his attack.

This was merely a spar, so he naturally had to take care not to overdo it with his attack.

Chao Xuan leaped up, and his face was completely flushed.

How could this be endured?

He had looked down greatly on the Rain Emperor, yet did not even manage to get a chance to fight back before he was defeated by the Rain Emperor. This was practically a plaque of humiliation on the path of his cultivation!

He was someone who would become an elite of the Eternal River Tier, so how could he accept this kind of terrible defeat?

“Again!” He leaped out. This time, he dared not be careless again. The light of Great Dao surged from his whole body, and interwoven divine patterns appeared, boosting his battle prowess to the peak.

The spectators looked on, and they were all shaking their heads internally.

You had already lost, yet were so sore about your defeat. That would only lead to others having an even lower opinion of you.

Thus, talent was only one factor of the equation. This was the prerequisite for becoming an elite, but if you wanted to become an elite, mere talent was far from enough.

But they had to admit that the present Chao Xuan was very strong, and could definitely not be taken lightly.

The Rain Emperor humphed coldly. He had also been angered as well. He looked down on such a sore loser.

Then, he merely had to punch him out again!

He shot out a punch at Chao Xuan.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

One punch followed after another. Though Chao Xuan was prepared this time, he was still forced into a retreat by the Rain Emperor’s attacks. He was actually still being completely subdued.

“Hey, hey, hey, why is this guy’s fist technique so frightening?”

“In terms of power, it would be Chao Xuan who is slightly superior, but why would he be at a disadvantage in a head-on exchange of blows?”

“That person’s fist technique is too powerful. Every punch seemed to have condensed the bearing of heaven and earth... hiss, he has the potential to become a grandmaster of his era!”

The people here all knew what was what, and they were incredibly stunned.

The Rain Emperor’s cultivation level could not be considered the apex in this place, but in terms of fist techniques, he had far surpassed all the so-called seeds, and reached a height that others could only look up to.

“Second Brother’s fist technique is close to Dao, haha, this is worthy of celebration!” Ling Han murmured quietly, a smile appearing on his face. In the great tomb in the galaxy, he had seen the Sword of the Great Dao, and the Rain Emperor’s fist technique seemed to be similarly boosted by great dao, so its might was naturally incredible.

However, he had been inspired after obtaining the Sword of the Great Dao, and only then did he comprehend his own path, while the Rain Emperor had completely relied on his own comprehension abilities. With such a comparison, even Ling Han had to admit he was convinced of the Rain Emperor’s genius.

This second brother of his was really born an extraordinary genius of martial arts.
