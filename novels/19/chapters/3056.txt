The Wang Clan of Qianshui Town was a very powerful clan in the local area. With a Severing Mundane ancestor in charge, the only clan that could rival the Wang Clan was the Li Clan. The two clans competed with each other, but they would also work together to eliminate the forces that might threaten them.

For hundreds of millions of years, although the two clans had some conflicts, they were also living in relative harmony.

However, on this night, blood flowed like a river in the Wang Clan.

An old servant knelt down in front of a youth with tears streaming down his face, and said, “Young Master, the ancestor, clan leader, and the others have all died in battle. You are the clan’s only hope. Please leave quickly!”

That young man looked to be only 15 or 16 years old. He was very stubborn, and his eyes flashed with light as he said, “There are no cowards in the Wang Clan who run away without fighting. I would rather die and be buried together with my great-grandfather and father!”

“Young Master, you can’t! You can’t!” the old servant advised, but the youth was determined, and was not moved at all.

“Young Master, I’m sorry for offending you.” The old servant made a move. Pa! He delivered a chop with his hand at the young man’s neck, causing him to faint.

The old servant dug a hole and buried the youth in it. He had just sprinkled leaves on it when his expression changed drastically.

“Young Master, you are the last seedling of the Wang Clan. Please live on!” The old servant knelt down and kowtowed a few times. Suddenly, he let out a long howl and used a motion technique, leaving quickly.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Immediately, five figures pounced over, close at the heels of the old servant’s figure as they chased after him.

“Old man, you can’t escape!”

“Hand over the remaining members of the Wang Clan, and we might spare your life.”

One fled, while the other five pursued, and soon all six disappeared without a trace.

Three days later, the ground cracked open, and the young man rushed out.

His name was Wang Quanhe, and he was the only son of the clan leader of the Wang Clan in Qianshui Town.

His eyes were red, as if they could spew fire.

“Uncle Qi must have lured away the pursuers for my safety,” Wang Quanhe muttered to himself. “The pursuers are so powerful. The odds would definitely have been against Uncle Qi.

“I can’t get myself killed as well.”

The young man calmed down. “I am the only one left in the Wang Clan. If I die as well, there will never be anyone to avenge the Wang Clan.

“Li Jingchu, you’re so cruel! So cruel!”

Wang Quanhe gritted his teeth. The destruction of the Wang Clan was all because of the Li Clan.

However, hadn’t the Wang and Li Clans always been evenly matched, with neither able to do anything to the other?

The story started three years ago when Wang Quanhe met Li Jingchu, the granddaughter of the second elder of the Li Clan. The young man had his first realization of love, and fell in love with her at first sight.

Unexpectedly, the other party also had a favorable impression of him. The two of them kept interacting with each other, and they quietly got together.

In the end, the young man mustered up the courage to confess to his family, only to be reprimanded.

Although the Wang and Li Clans could not be considered as feuding clans, they had always competed with each other, and there had been many nasty incidents. How could there be a marriage alliance? Moreover, it would involve an important figure like the future clan leader.

However, Wang Quanhe had made up his mind. Coincidentally, the Li Clan had also sent someone over, and said that they might as well allow this marriage. From then on, the Wang and Li Clans would become a family and help each other.

In the end, the Wang Clan had no choice but to compromise and agree to this marriage.

However, on the day of the wedding, all the important figures of the Wang Clan were poisoned. The Li Clan members who came to the banquet also bared their fangs, and started a massacre. In one night, they killed all the important figures of the Wang Clan.

Wang Quanhe was rescued by the clan’s loyal servants, but after being hunted down the whole way, he was only left with one old servant, who had probably met with misfortune as well.

What Wang Quanhe found most unacceptable and heartbreaking was that it was Li Jingchu who had poisoned the important figures of the clan.

When she was paying her respects to the Wang Clan, she served tea to them one by one. The poison was contained in the tea.

Who would have thought that the new bride would be so ruthless?

Such a betrayal naturally made Wang Quanhe’s heart ache. He blamed himself. He felt that it was his fault that the Wang Clan was destroyed. That was why he wanted to fight the Li Clan to the death in a moment of impulse.

However, after calming down, he knew that this was just sending himself to his death. It would only cause the deaths of his parents and family to be even more unjust.

“I want revenge.

“But first, I have to get out of here.

“There’s only hope if you’re alive.”

He left Qianshui Town and walked forward without any destination in mind. Three years later, he arrived in a large city. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Along the way, he encountered countless dangers. There were ferocious beasts and mountain bandits who had killed countless people, but his luck was incomparably good. He could always find a chance to survive when he was at the end of his rope.

His clothes were ragged, and he no longer looked like the young master of the Wang Clan. He looked like a beggar.

After entering the city, Wang Quanhe walked in a daze.

He longed for revenge, but how could it be easy for him to take revenge?

Without the support of the Wang Clan, he was only a mere Heavenly Body Tier. How could he advance into the Severing Mundane Tier?

It was a long way off.

As he walked, he stopped. His heart was filled with dejection.

He sat down in a daze.

A great elite in this city had created a sun and moon. Soon, the sun set and the moon rose, scattering gentle moonlight.

‘No, I can’t continue to be like this. If I lose my will to fight, who can avenge the Wang Clan?’

Wang Quanhe regained a trace of fighting spirit. He got up, and was about to find a place to rest when he suddenly saw a notice on the opposite wall.

It said that as long as they went to Prince Xuan’s Mansion in the city for some kind of test, if they passed, they would be able to obtain a promise from Prince Ma Xuan. They could make any request, even if it was to marry Prince Ma Xuan’s daughter.

Who was Prince Ma Xuan?

He was a Celestial King!

Wang Quanhe was stunned, and he couldn’t help but have a glimmer of hope. If he could pass this test, then could he ask Prince Ma Xuan to exterminate the Li Clan?

He naturally knew that to be able to make a Celestial King offer such conditions, there were probably only a handful of people in the world who could pass this test, and his hope was infinitely close to zero… However, he still had to give it a try. What if… What if…?

He headed toward Prince Xuan’s Manor in the city, and saw that there was a line at the entrance. More and more people were coming out, shaking their heads and sighing.

“Sigh, can anyone really pass that test?”

“It is not a test of natural talent in cultivation, and it is not a test on abilities in cultivation, either. How exactly can one pass?”

“It’s weird.”

The people who came out were still complaining, but it didn’t affect the enthusiasm of the people lining up outside. If they passed, the rewards would be too great.

“What kind of test is it?” someone in the line asked.

“You have to put something on your head. You don’t have to do anything. In about 10 breaths, they’ll tell you that you haven’t passed the test, and that you can leave now,” the person who came out said.

Upon hearing this, Wang Quanhe felt a surge of hope, but he also felt that his hopes were extremely faint.

His natural talent in cultivation wasn’t bad, but it couldn’t be considered top-notch, either. At the very least, there were many people superior to him. Therefore, in terms of natural talent in cultivation, it was absolutely impossible for him to pass.

Thus, he was a little more confident in himself. However, with so many people unable to pass, he was naturally not confident at all.

“Tsk, what a joke. Even a beggar came to try his luck?”
