2933 Robbed again

Ling Han channeled all the ninth-grade seals, and exploded with astonishing power for a short period of time. He also released all the dimensional projections in one go.

19 dimensions!

Even Xin Qihu was shocked. He didn’t expect that the 11 dimensions that he had seen Ling Han previously channel were far from his limit!

“You actually have 19 dimensions; then, there’s even more reason to kill you!” he said with killing intent.

Peng, peng, peng! Xin Qihu exploded with power, and under the crushing pressure of Sixth-Tier battle prowess, so what if there were 19 projections of medium-level dimensions? They could only be destroyed in an instant.

However, seizing an opening in this instant, Ling Han had also won himself a sliver of a chance to escape.

Heavenly Venerates were hard to kill, what more when Ling Han possessed Fifth-Tier battle prowess.

Xiu! He fled, his figure extraordinarily fast.

“F***!”

Ling Han cursed vehemently. He couldn’t tolerate it any longer. He was determined to advance to the Fourth Tier.

“I’m going into seclusion. This time, I won’t come out unless I reach the Fourth Tier!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He tunneled into the ground. With the Heavenly Venerable Stone hiding his traces, even Sixth Tier elites couldn’t find him with their divine sense. They would have to dig deep into the ground to find him physically.

This should be quite safe.

“Little Bai, I’m sorry.” Ling Han took out a Great Herb, and began to munch madly.

Bai Mifan’s share was here, but he planned to eat all of it.

It couldn’t be helped. Though Ling Han was already in the late stage of the Third Tier, and seemed not to be far from the Fourth Tier, it was really too difficult for him to advance a little further. He needed a great amount of energy, so it was really a question whether these 200-plus Great Herbs would be enough to send him to the peak stage of the Third Tier.

‘Forget it; just eat them.’

Ling Han ate a Great Herb, and the innumerable Powers of Dimension in his body vibrated at the same time, automatically channeling. They were like a millstone that was crushing the medicinal effects into endless extremely pure energy, which was then rapidly absorbed.

Digesting a Great Herb actually only took him a day’s time.

Ling Han was speechless with shock. He was becoming more and more freakish. If it was another Fifth Tier that was to eat this Great Herb, he would not be able to digest all of it without a year’s time. The energy contained within was too terrifying.

Ling Han’s advancement through the cultivation levels was slow, but the benefits he received were also incredibly astonishing. Just take the Power of Dimension for example; it could disperse and absorb the attacks of enemies. Who else could accomplish this?

‘I’ll have another.’

Crack! Ling Han took out another Great Herb and began to chew it. Then, it was the third, the fourth As the number of Great Herbs decreased rapidly, his cultivation level was also slowly increasing.

More than half a year later, there were only three Great Herbs left, and Ling Han’s cultivation level was finally close to the peak stage of the Third Tier.

‘There are only three left, and they still can’t send me to the peak stage of the Third Tier.’ Ling Han frowned. ‘If it was other Fifth Tiers, this would be enough to deliver them from the early stage of the Fifth Tier to the peak stage a few times over.

‘However, I only need 10 Great Herbs to solve the problem.

‘This shouldn’t be too difficult to resolve.’

After Ling Han consumed the remaining three Great Herbs, he went out to search for new veins of ore. However, a few thousand years had already passed, and most of the raw stone veins here had already been mined. It was already difficult to find even a single vein of ore, what more to harvest about 10 Great Herbs.

Ling Han’s frown became deeper and deeper, yet he still roamed around in the surroundings. Even if he couldn’t find veins of ore, just let him find a spatial passageway to enter a dimension further below. That way, it would definitely be no problem for him to obtain another 10 Great Herbs.

As he was thinking, he suddenly discovered an aura crashing towards him from ahead.

Heavenly Venerates would release their auras, but they would limit it within a specific range. The area within this range was equivalent to the Heavenly Venerate’s absolute territory. Furthermore, in this dangerous place, this territory was naturally even more important as various bits of information could be fed back to the Heavenly Venerate in the nick of time so they could avoid danger in advance.

Ling Han naturally had also released his own aura. He had crashed into the other’s aura, and the other person had also crashed into his.

Both of them were shocked, and then discovered that the other party was extremely strong, not inferior to themselves at all.

Then, in the next instant, they saw each other.

Feng Wuding.

How coincidental. Was this the so-called “it was destined that enemies would meet”?

Ling Han let out a battle cry and laughed. Without another word, he immediately rushed up and began fighting.

“Ling Han!” Feng Wuding only had time to roar in fury before he had no choice but to counterattack. He knew how powerful Ling Han was, and there was no third person here. Even if he was killed, no one would be able to find out that it was Ling Han.

He counterattacked with all his might, directly channeling his full power. He was the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World from the last generation, and would become the only sovereign in the world in future. It was extremely possible that he would surpass the Seventh Tier, so how could he die here?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

However, what greeted him was Ling Han’s iron fist. He was boosted by eighth-grade seals, and though only half was used, they could increase his power by as many as 500 times. This was something that Feng Wuding could not match, no matter what secret technique he used.

Feng Wuding was beaten up, and he was extremely depressed. Just think, he was the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World from the last generation, but why had he encountered Ling Han? The latter had shattered all of his confidence to bits.

Ling Han’s eyes were cold. He did not care what kind of prodigy Feng Wuding was. Feng Wuding was in the World Alliance, and the World Alliance had severely wounded his daughter and son-in-law. This debt had to be paid back in double.

He had no enmity with Feng Wuding, but who asked Feng Wuding to join the World Alliance?

But just as Ling Han was about to deliver a fatal strike, he sensed another aura, which was incredibly powerful.

The third person soon appeared. It was Wu Haoyang.

A thought immediately flashed through Ling Han’s mind. Should he kill him or not?

If he killed him, then unless he killed Wu Haoyang to keep him quiet, Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan and the other Seventh Tier elites would probably abandon everything else and ignore Hysteria to seek Ling Han out for an accounting when they found out.

By then, it would probably be very difficult to save him even with Lin Luo interfering.

The problem was that, firstly, Ling Han could not kill Wu Haoyang to keep him quiet, and secondly, there was no reason for him to kill an innocent person, either.

Forget it.

He immediately made his decision, but it was one thing not to kill him. He still threw a punch, beating Feng Wuding to the point that he lost all ability to resist. Then, he searched out the Spatial Tool that he possessed.

With a sweep of his divine sense, Ling Han couldn’t help but look pleased. There were actually 14 Great Herbs inside, and they were all yellow-colored Great Herbs.

“Thanks.” Ling Han laughed loudly, and casually tossed Feng Wuding onto the ground. Then, he nodded at Wu Haoyang, turned, and left.

...

Wu Haoyang did not stop him. This was not the Realm Battlefield, so how could there be so many rules? As long as Ling Han did not kill anyone, it would be fine.

But now, all these Great Herbs had actually benefited his rival. How could Feng Wuding not be fuming with anger?

“Ah!!” he roared in fury.
