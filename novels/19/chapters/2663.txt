2664 A willful little princess

As Ling Han saw it, he had no wish to lower himself to the same level as the woman, but as Wang Jiayue saw it, Ling Han’s attitude was too arrogant.

Who was she?

A member of the main branch of the Wang Clan, a little princess, and the most beloved descendant of the grand elder of the Wang Clan. And who was the grand elder of the Wang Clan? A Third Tier Heavenly Venerate!

When she spoke, it should be obeyed like a royal command. It was already great disrespect that this brat was not scared out of his wits and did not fall to his knees in front of her to beg for forgiveness. He was actually still so nonchalant and relaxed?

Detestable, he was really too detestable.

“Ling Han, you have gone too far. Don’t you know that this is the young mistress of the Wang Clan?” Someone jumped out to charge and break through enemy lines for Wang Jiayue’s sake.

…Not only was Wang Jiayue exquisitely beautiful, she was also astonishingly talented in cultivation. Moreover, she had a grand elder that was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate behind her. With these three factors all compounded on a single woman, how could it not turn countless men into besotted fools?

“That’s right. This is territory of the Wang Clan!” someone shouted as well.

At this moment, a great many people were rebuking Ling Han. This was a chance to perform. If they were able to form connections with the Wang Clan, this would possibly be a great opportunity for them.

Of course, there were also a great many people that were standing by and watching. That was because there would always be people who were knowledgeable, and had found out that Ling Han had only managed to come here from the Celestial Realm because Zhou Heng had deliberately left behind a Dimensional Transfer Seal for him.

Perhaps Zhou Heng purely treasured Ling Han’s talent, or perhaps he had plans of taking Ling Han as a disciple?

It should be known that Zhou Heng himself was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, while his master was the strongest existence across the realms.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, Lin Luo!

Compared with this, what was the Wang Clan? In any case, this was none of their business, so why should they join in on the excitement for no reason? It might cause them to fall out of favor with both sides.

Ling Han frowned. He did not want to lower himself to the level of others, but that did not mean that he was an easy target to bully. His eyes swept over her, and he said calmly, “If I do not remember wrongly, this is the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, so what do you mean by mentioning the territory of the Wang Clan? Who do you think you are? With just mere words, you have decreed the territory of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy to be under the authority of the Wang Clan?”

With this question from Ling Han, the one who had spoken was instantly rendered speechless.

This was indeed not the Wang Clan’s territory, but the Wang Clan was hosting a banquet here. From a certain angle, wasn’t this the territory of the Wang Clan?

“Anyways, you must apologize to Celestial maiden Wang!” That man clung firmly onto this issue.

Ling Han had no intention to waste any more words; he moved directly.

Though that man was also a Sixth Heaven Celestial King, even if he was a monarch tier, so what? Would he be able to withstand a single strike from Ling Han?

Pa! The man was directly sent flying with a slap from Ling Han. Blood sprayed out in all directions. Like Zhuo Kai, half of his face was also gone from the impact, and the sight was too terrible for words.

Everyone inhaled sharply, and felt that Ling Han was really too violent. He was really not giving the Wang Clan any face at all.

Wang Jiayue was even trembling with anger, her delicate hands clenched tightly, and flames were practically about to shoot from her eyes.

Meanwhile, Ling Han said slowly, “I suggest you take better care with your words, and don’t think of making a rash move. Though I do not enjoy hitting women, I will not be merciful when I encounter a shrew, either.”

Wang Jiayue’s small mouth was half-gaping, with her almost passing out in anger.

Sh-shrew?

She, the noble princess of the Wang Clan, the most pampered descendant of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, was actually called a shrew!

But she really was intimidated by Ling Han. She was no idiot. That man, a Sixth Heaven Celestial King, had been sent flying with a single slap, so what was she, a Celestial King who had just broken through, worth? Though Ling Han was nonchalant and relaxed, the murderous aura in his eyes clearly indicated that his previous words were definitely not a joke.

She was delicate and noble. Was there any need for her to come to blows with a gruff man?

Wang Jiayue hurriedly stepped back. It was fine that she was no match for Ling Han. Could it be that there would be no one that could do anything to Ling Han with so many people here? After all, he was just a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

“Who can suppress this villain for my sake!” she called out loudly.

When her words fell, there was a complete silence. Even the person who had stood up for her previously only acted as if he had not heard her words.

‘This…!’

Wang Jiayue was dumbfounded. In her thoughts, countless people would definitely immediately rush out and stand up for her with a mere word from her. But the situation now was something that she had never expected. How could this be? It was like these people were all very afraid of Ling Han.

Who exactly was he? Was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King really so strong?

“Yue Yue, what is it?” A gentle voice rang out, and a man in black robes strode in. Eight ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him, a heroic spirit exuding from him. With his every movement, his aura was vigorous and active.

“Brother Hai!” When Wang Jiayue saw him, she instantly showed a hint of delight. It was as if she had found her pillar of support. She quickly pointed at Ling Han. “This guy acted violently and caused injury in the banquet of our Wang Clan, and even wants to hit me!”

She felt extremely aggrieved. When had she ever received such treatment in all the years of her life?

“Ma Yuhai!” someone immediately muttered lowly.

“This is also a character!”

“He is one of the strongest in the last batch of disciples. It seems like he is a supreme monarch star.”

“It’s not just that; his father is Ma Feng!”

“Pff, Ma Feng1?”

“Hehe, just with the way you are mocking, it is really possible that even if you were killed, it would be a worthless death! Lord Ma Feng is a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!”

“Gasp!”

Everyone was whispering spiritedly, and also revealed the identity of this man in black robes.

“Judging by Wang Jiayue’s attitude, the two of them seem to be lovers?”

“No wonder the young mistress of the Wang Clan favors no one. It seems that she has long since had someone that she liked.”

“Tsk, tsk. Ma Yuhai. No wonder, no wonder.”

A great many people showed hints of envy. That was Wang Jiayue. Not only was she extremely beautiful, she was also the most pampered descendant of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Marrying her, one would definitely get the full support of a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ma Yuhai strode over. He first paused to stand beside Wang Jiayue, his eyes gentle and doting as he said, “Yue Yue, don’t be afraid. With your Brother Hai here, I will definitely not allow you to feel the slightest grievance.”

“En!” Wang Jiayue nodded obediently, the eyes she directed at Ma Yuhai filled with admiration.

She had known Ma Yuhai for a long time, and whichever excellent characters from her clan were compared against him, they all paled in color beside his brilliance. Hence, in her heart, Ma Yuhai was one who would never lose a battle.

Whatever the matter, as long as Ma Yuhai said he could settle the matter, that meant he definitely could settle the matter.

Ma Yuhai withdrew his gaze, then turned towards Ling Han, and said calmly, “Kneel down and apologize, and I can consider just crippling one of your arms!”

Several million years ago, he had already begun courting Wang Jiayue. Maintaining an elegant, dashing demeanor, and with his outstanding natural talent in cultivation, he caused this young girl who was inexperienced and naive to immediately develop affection for him.

His goal was very clear, and that was to get the Wang Clan as his backer. Of course, Wang Jiayue was exquisite, and her natural talent in cultivation was also extraordinary. He also liked her very much.

Ling Han chuckled, and shook his head. “Just for these words, I will break all your four limbs!”

These people had repeatedly provoked him, and he had already lost all patience with them.

“Haha, to dare to act so arrogantly in front of me, Ma Yuhai, you are definitely the first!” Ma Yuhai sneered. He stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han. “However… what right do you have to do this? Just lie down!”

When Celestial Kings battled, the destruction caused would definitely be extremely widespread. Ordinarily, there was no way that this could happen indoors, but Ma Yuhai thought that his strength would overwhelm Ling Han. Since he would be able to take down Ling Han with a single move, then even if they fought indoors, so what?FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
