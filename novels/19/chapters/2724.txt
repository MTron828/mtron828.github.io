2725 Resurrection of Yuan Sheng!

“Kill, stab me with the sword if you can!” Heavenborn laughed loudly. “Don’t forget, Yuan Sheng and I share this body. If I die, it means he will be dead too!”

The large black dog jumped over and paced around in circles anxiously. “Little Han, what should we do now?”

Ling Han smiled lightly. “If we truly can’t save Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, then we’ll just have to erase this person!”

Heavenborn was a personification of the realm, so his way of thinking would definitely be different from normal people’s. If he was allowed to continue getting stronger, he definitely wouldn’t fight against Hysteria. Rather, he would want to be the second Hysteria, or perhaps he might want to eliminate Hysteria and dominate the Genesis World.

Killing another person was actually quite simple; one just needed to remove your own and the other party’s rings before the actual deed.

Hearing the indifference in Ling Han’s voice, Heavenborn couldn’t help but feel a shiver run down his spine. Ling Han really wanted to kill him; it was no empty threat.

What to do now?

He didn’t want to die.

“Don’t you all want to save Yuan Sheng?” he shouted; he was clutching at straws to save himself.

The large black dog was also pacing up and down. In spite of the fact that Heavenborn was now captured, the question of how to save Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had become a big problem.

Ling Han smiled, and with a hook of his foot, the Black Tower fell into his hands.

He couldn’t help feeling rueful; after more than 100,000,000 years, the Black Tower finally returned to him.

“Okay, I’ll let you have this Heavenly Venerate Tool as a gift!” Heavenborn said. “I can erase the martial intent on it, and it shall no longer have any relationship to me. How about it? A Heavenly Venerate Tool in exchange for my life—you’re gaining a huge profit from this trade.”

He was also capable of being flexible. In his opinion, as long as he was being given time to grow stronger, his future achievements would not be lower than those of Hysteria. All the elites in the world would just become nutrition for him.

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. All of a sudden, he picked up the Black Tower and smashed it against Heavenborn, directly targeting the head.

With a clang, Heavenborn was dazed from the impact.

What kind of power did Ling Han possess? Had he used all his strength in this strike, with the destructive power of the Heavenly Venerate Tool, Heavenborn’s head would have already become pulp.

However, Ling Han didn’t intend to kill Heavenborn, so he controlled his power in this strike, only causing Heavenborn damage.

It was like hitting an ordinary person with a wooden stick. If you exerted too much force, you could kill them, but if you controlled the force, you would knock people unconscious or cause dizziness or physical injury.

The degree of force which Ling Han used was the second type; he knocked Heavenborn dizzy and caused him injury.

Under such a blow, Heavenborn couldn’t control himself at all, so how could he destroy the soul of Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

Moreover, the Black Tower was personally forged by Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. Such a blow would cause injury to Heavenborn, but it would have absolutely no effect on the soul of Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

Slowly obliterating the soul of Heavenborn in this way, all that remained could only be the lingering soul of Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. Even if it was just a tiny little bit, and would be extremely weak when resurrected, he would eventually recover as long as there was enough time.

The large black dog obviously thought of the same thing as well, and couldn’t help clapping with his paws. “Ingenious, ingenious!”

It was impossible to implement such a tactic before, as Ling Han’s strength had fallen short when compared to that of Heavenborn, but now that he had surpassed him in battle prowess, this method became feasible and effective.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

One blow after another, although Heavenborn knew this wasn’t right, how could he control his body? It was like someone was beating drums and gongs right next to the ear of an ordinary person, causing them to feel dizzy, light-headed, and unable to think at all.

“Ah!” Heavenborn could only utter such an angry roar, but it immediately came to an abrupt stop.

Clang, only such melodious sound of the blows continued on endlessly.

So what if he had the physique of Divine Metal? He could only tremble under the impact of being struck by the Heavenly Venerate Tool.

However, Heavenborn indeed was able to hold on for quite some time.

10 days, one month, and half a year had passed, yet he was still struggling and didn’t crumble.

Ling Han naturally did not lack patience; to say nothing of half a year, he could spend 1,000 or even 10,000,000 years like this.

He owed his life twice to Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, so how could he not even have such patience?

Three years, five years… 10 years later, Heavenborn really couldn’t endure it any longer.

Under the continuous impact of the strikes with the Black Tower, his body was already covered with cracks, and he bled profusely with golden blood. This was due to Ling Han already holding back his strength, otherwise just being hit once with the Black Tower might have already caused Heavenborn’s body to fall apart.

Heavenborn cursed as his body glowed with black light—he wanted to go all out and fight to the death.

It was not for the sake of taking Ling Han down together with him, but to completely erase the lingering soul of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

“Still trying to do evil?” Ling Han smiled. Clang, he struck hard with the Black Tower again. Heavenborn’s body trembled violently, and then his limbs drooped, as if he was dead.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Ling Han hit a few more times, but Heavenborn did not have any reaction, only that his body would tremble for a moment after he had struck him.

“Have you beaten him to death?” The large black dog came up to him.

Ling Han nodded. “The soul of Heavenborn should have died, but whether Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable can come back to life will depend on his good fortune.”

It would mainly depend on the strength of the lingering soul. If it was too weak, then it would just be like a worn candle in the wind, and would soon be extinguished.

This would require Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable himself to have a strong will to survive. He had long since died, after all. Logically, it was impossible for him to come back to life.

“Oh, Heavenly Venerate, you are an absolutely strong man. Back then, you fought against 11 Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm all by yourself. You can definitely overcome this little difficulty,” the large black dog murmured, cheering for the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

“Oh, Heavenly Venerate, you are an extraordinary genius through the ages. Presently, Hysteria is on a rampage. We are still waiting for you to resolve the matter; you must come back alive!”

Now all that Ling Han and the large black dog could do was wait. 10 years, 100 years, and 1,000 years had passed. The only thing that made them feel relieved was that Heavenborn’s body was slowly recovering. The lacerations that were originally caused by being hit with Black Tower were slowly healing.

This might be a wishful desire, but it might also be that Heavenborn’s physique was indeed so tough, having such an ability even after death.

3,000 years later, Heavenborn’s fingers suddenly twitched slightly.

The large black dog instantly felt surprised and happy, but also extremely worried.

This might be Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable coming back to life, but it was also possible that Heavenborn hadn’t died at all, and then they would have rejoiced too soon.

Ling Han also looked over. All these years, he hadn’t wasted time, either, and had been cultivating in order to reach the peak of the Ninth Heaven as soon as possible. He had also made significant progress in Body Art. Being boosted by Heavenly Venerable Tier seals, his cultivation speed was extremely fast.

Heavenborn’s eyelids moved slightly, and then his eyes opened.

It was a pair of clear eyes, with dominance that came from looking down on the rest of the world and absolute self-confidence, but also filled with compassion for mankind.

It definitely wasn’t Heavenborn.

It was obviously the same face and body, but because of the change in his gaze, it made people feel as if he was a completely different person.

“H-Heavenly Venerate!” the large black dog shouted, his voice trembling. The greater the expectation, the more he was afraid of failure.

“It’s me.” Heavenborn nodded.

At this moment, he should no longer be Heavenborn, but rather the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable!

Ling Han laughed heartily. “Congratulations, Master!” He offered up the Black Tower with both hands.

This precious tool accompanied him for many years, from when he was weak to when he became strong, until it left him when he became a Celestial King. Now that he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and the Divine Demon Sword also became a Heavenly Venerate Tool… he had already carved out a path of his own.
