2984 Encounter

Ling Han caught the Great Herbs and nodded with a smile, saying, “Bye-bye.”

Feng Wuding shook with fury. Which other Seventh Tier elite had to suffer such humiliation?

Perhaps he was the only one.

Even though he wasn’t a genuine Seventh Tier elite, he did indeed possess battle prowess at the Seventh Tier. Thus, he could somewhat be considered a Seventh Tier elite.

This was utter humiliation! This was utter embarrassment!

Feng Wuding noted this down in his mind. He would transform this into boundless motivation driving him to reach the Sixth Tier or even the Seventh Tier more quickly. He would then defeat Ling Han and return all the humiliation that he had suffered. He would also…

“Stop daydreaming. Hurry up and piss off,” Ling Han said with a wave of his hand, disrupting Feng Wuding’s fanciful thoughts.

‘F*ck! You’re even trying to control my thoughts now?’

Feng Wuding gritted his teeth and turned around to leave. If he stayed, he would only suffer more humiliation at the hands of Ling Han.

Ling Han turned around to face Xin Qihu.

“You actually didn’t interfere just then!” he said with an expression of slight surprise. If Xin Qihu had teamed up with Feng Wuding, the outcome of the battle would have been difficult to predict.

“Teaming up with him? Wouldn’t that be lowering my own status?” Xin Qihu scoffed.

Even though Ling Han detested this person, he still couldn’t help but feel a sense of admiration upon hearing this.

Feng Wuding was indeed more talented than Xin Qihu. However, his sense of pride was greatly inferior.

“Then let us battle again!” Ling Han said. The two of them hadn’t determined a victor yet.

“As you wish,” Xin Qihu replied as he charged forward, taking the initiative and unleashing the first attack.

The two of them became locked in an intense battle. However, just like before, this was a battle that was only intense on the surface. They were both attacking each other from range, with neither of them being able to genuinely threaten the other.

After battling for three days, they both decided to stop at the same time.

“I’ll be sure to end your pathetic life the next time we meet,” Ling Han promised.

“I’ll have you beheaded!” Xin Qihu replied, not backing down in the least.

The two of them parted ways, each going in a different direction as they continued to search for veins of ore. They needed to obtain more resources to accelerate their growth.

Ling Han was filled with motivation. He needed to crush Xin Qihu, and he needed to overcome Shatter Mountains, Chong Yan, and the others. These ambitions made him thirst for even more power.

However, this dimension was truly too small, and it was also completely shattered and damaged. Thus, Ling Han quickly discovered that all of the veins of ore had already been cleaned out.

He needed to venture a level deeper.

Ling Han descended further down, and what he saw caused him to frown slightly.

After reaching this level, the fundamental particles weren’t just burning anymore. Instead, they were thick and concentrated, and they had all taken material form.

The six types of fundamental particles formed the Source Powers of the Genesis World. They possessed unimaginable power. When these fundamental particles gathered together, one could imagine just how much of an obstruction they would become.

Trying to push through them would be like an ordinary mortal trying to wade through a swamp. It would be incredibly difficult.

Zhou Heng had said before that even genuine Seventh Tier elites would be stopped at the 33rd level. This was because the fundamental particles in that level were so concentrated that they already formed an impenetrable wall.

This was understandable when looking at the situation on this level. The slightly more concentrated fundamental particles were already enough to slow Ling Han down so much. It was easy to imagine that the fundamental particles could indeed stop even Seventh Tier elites if they were 100 times or even 10,000 times more concentrated.

Ling Han advanced at an incredibly slow rate. The fundamental particles carried with them boundless karmic flames as they whizzed around, causing them to be astonishingly destructive. This caused Ling Han to feel like he was battling against a Seventh Tier elite the entire time. In fact, not with one Seventh Tier elite, but with hundreds upon thousands of Seventh Tier elites. It was as if they were bombarding him with attacks. Ling Han was under great strain.

After all, his physique still had yet to reach the Seventh Tier, so he had to deal with every single attack. Otherwise, he would definitely be wounded. Once he became wounded in this harsh environment, he would descend into a vicious cycle where his wounds would only grow more and more severe. In the end, he would be killed.

Great opportunities were always accompanied by grave dangers. This was a saying born from experience.

Of course, this wasn’t relevant for Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates. After reaching this paramount level, they no longer needed to worry about their own safety. They could go anywhere they wanted, not caring about whom or what they came across. They were transcendent above all matter.

After struggling for 700 entire years, Ling Han finally managed to leave the mantle of this level and enter the next dimension. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Boom!

He was immediately attacked after he arrived, with an explosive gust of wind slamming into him. Fortunately, this gust of wind was only at the Sixth Tier, allowing him to easily deal with it.

Ling Han glanced around, and a smile immediately appeared on his face.

Even though there were also signs of excavation in this place, it hadn’t been completely cleaned out yet. There was still value in exploring this dimension.

Ling Han started to look around, not forgetting to chow down on the Great Herbs that Feng Wuding had “offered” to him at the same time. In just a few days, all of the Great Herbs were finished.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. The excessive number of dimensions in his body naturally allowed him to possess heaven-defying battle prowess. At the same time, however, this caused his cultivation speed to become shockingly low. After eating so many Great Herbs, his cultivation had only advanced by the tiniest bit.

Search, search, and more searching… He continued to look around, and he did indeed make some gains.

After all, there was only a limited number of Seventh Tier elites in the world, and not all of them would have necessarily come to this place. For example, Chong Yan and Shatter Mountains had come here to look for Great Herbs for Feng Wuding before. Now that Feng Wuding also possessed a battle prowess at the Seventh Tier, however, would they still do this for him?

The answer was naturally no. After all, these people weren’t nannies.

Similarly, since Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu had advanced to the Sixth Tier and gained battle prowess of the Seventh Tier, Lin Luo and Xin Fu naturally wouldn’t come here again, either. They couldn’t possibly do everything for their children, could they?

Ling Han’s cultivation was increasing slowly. However, his cultivation speed was still several times faster than if he were simply cultivating in seclusion.

Of course, Ling Han didn’t abandon his normal cultivation, either. He kept the Heavenly Venerable Seals in his body illuminated the entire time, allowing them to absorb fundamental particles and strengthen the seemingly boundless Power of Dimension inside him.

Right now, he possessed more than 400 Heavenly Venerable Seals. Even though very few of them were high-level, he was in possession of three complete combination seal sets, and this allowed his cultivation speed to increase by a whopping 3500-fold.

Even so, his progress was still abysmally slow. This was a reflection of just how boundless the Power of Dimension inside him was.

This was a necessary price to pay if he wanted to become more powerful. After all, how could one possess an astonishing cultivation speed yet remain invincible at their cultivation level at the same time?

After 30,000 years, this dimension was pretty much cleaned up by Ling Han. He was just about to set off for the next dimension, yet a powerful aura suddenly charged over with ferocity.

‘Seventh Tier!’

Ling Han immediately came to his senses. Only when an elite perfected their fundamental powers and reached the Seventh Tier could their aura be so powerful and domineering.

‘Who is it?

‘Zhou Heng? Or Chu Hao?’

Even though this aura was astoundingly powerful, Ling Han could also sense that it wasn’t entirely stable. Thus, this was most likely a newly advanced Seventh Tier elite. Of course, “newly advanced” didn’t mean that this person had only reached the Seventh Tier in the past two days. When it came to Seventh Tier elites, even those who had been at the Seventh Tier for 10 billion years could be considered as newly advanced.

Whoosh!

A person appeared before Ling Han, with his body shrouded in suns, moons, and stars. His aura was astonishingly domineering.

Ling Han squinted his eyes. This person was surprisingly Golden Silk Moth.

‘He actually advanced to the Seventh Tier?’

Ling Han already knew that among the Sixth Tier elites, Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, Ten Thousand Shadows, and Golden Silk Moth had the best chance of advancing to the Seventh Tier. In the end, however, it was proven that Zhou Heng and Chu Hao were slightly more freakish than the others—they had been able to advance to the Seventh Tier relying on their own abilities.

By the looks of it, Golden Silk Moth had most likely obtained a shard of a dimension core, and it was thanks to this that he was able to advance to the Seventh Tier.
