“Chong Yan and the four others are from the Genesis World of the last era. After their world collapsed, and after slumbering for so many years, it’s understandable that their way of thinking has changed, though this doesn’t make them any more deserving of forgiveness. However, Ten Thousand Shadows and Golden Silk Moth? Humph!” There was an intense look in Blood Rainbow’s eyes, and his body was brimming with killing intent.

“Ten Thousand Shadows was only able to advance to the Seventh Tier thanks to the core fragments that we gave him, yet he’s actually chosen to betray us now? Unforgivable!” Xin Fu also spat with anger and ferocity in his eyes.

They were so furious that they wanted to kill someone. However, this wish was nothing more than a pipe dream. Seventh Tier elites were undying, and this was the case even though Ten Thousand Shadows and Golden Silk Moth had only just advanced to this tier, and were far weaker than the others.

Lin Luo waved his hand, and said, “Since this has already become reality, talking about it any more won’t be of any help to us. What we need now is a plan to deal with the situation.”

“This is the last transcendent dimension in the Genesis World, so we definitely have to defend it no matter the cost. Otherwise, everything will be done for,” Wu Zhihong opined.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “We won’t be able to defend it.”

Blood Rainbow frowned, and said, “Don’t ruin our morale!”

“It’s the truth,” Ling Han replied. He had dared to challenge Seventh Tier elites while still at the Fifth Tier, so he was naturally even more unafraid of Seventh Tier elites now. However, they were all on the same side, so his attitude was naturally more amiable.

“If we exclude Hysteria, the number of Seventh Tier elites in the enemy camp is coincidentally equal to ours. Moreover, their battle prowess is also very similar to ours.

“So, if we decide to battle them one on one, there’ll obviously be no one left to stop Hysteria.”

The ultimate elites all fell silent. Speaking boldly was easy, but they couldn’t choose to ignore this grim reality. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xin Fu turned to Ling Han, and asked, “Then what do you suggest we do?”

Ling Han pondered for a brief moment before replying, “One, wait, and two, retreat.”

What did this mean?

Everyone looked at Ling Han. They had no option but to admit that he had already become the backbone of the Genesis World.

“It’s impossible for us to defend the Profound Negative Realm,” Ling Han explained. “Since that’s the case, our best option is to wait. We’ll wait until Hysteria engulfs this dimension, and we’ll pull the chestnut out of the fire at that time. We’ll snatch the core of the dimension from under its nose.

“If we succeed, then Brother Xin, Brother Wu, Brother Bai, and Miss Lin will all have an opportunity to advance to the Seventh Tier.

“If they become Seventh Tier elites, then they’ll also become indestructible, even if their battle prowess doesn’t increase immediately. In any case, that will give them the right to face Hysteria.

“Even if it’s only four of them, they’ll at least be able to slow Hysteria down a little.

“In addition to this, we can continue to retreat, all the way to a low-level dimension. We’ll allow Hysteria to engulf all the other dimensions. This will buy us more time.”

Ling Han paused for a moment before continuing, “I still have a lot of room for improvement. I haven’t even reached the peak stage of the Sixth Tier yet.”

The so-called peak stage of the Sixth Tier that he talked about wasn’t referring to the five fundamental powers inside him reaching a consummate level. Instead, he was referring to the dimensions inside him elevating to a higher level.

Everyone grimaced upon hearing this. Ling Han’s battle prowess had been growing at a breakneck pace. From initially struggling to suppress an elite at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, he had advanced to being able to suppress five ultimate elites by himself. A short while ago, he had even been able to rival Hysteria and force it to retreat. All of this was done by a Sixth Tier elite!

With such incredible feats to his name, it wouldn’t be surprising even if someone claimed that he was a Seventh Tier or Eighth Tier elite. However, he actually had yet to reach the peak stage of the Sixth Tier! Just how astonishing was this?

Ling Han looked at everyone, and said, “We can get a move on now. Relocate everyone in the medium-level dimensions and try to move them all to the low-level dimensions.

“In fact, we can directly move everyone to the Celestial Realm that sits at the very end. We’ll engage in a final battle with Hysteria there!”

This was far too bold and decisive, no? Retreating to the very end, to a place with no more room for retreat in a single step… How resolute!

The seven ultimate elites exchanged glances before falling deep in thought.

If they retreated to the Celestial Realm, they would genuinely have nowhere left to retreat after that. They wouldn’t even have the power to blow up the Genesis World to drag Hysteria down with them.

“That’s impossible now,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. “Since Hysteria has already fallen victim to this before, it definitely won’t fall victim to it a second time.”

Everyone was disappointed upon hearing this. However, the seven ultimate elites slowly nodded in agreement. They wouldn’t fall at the same hurdle twice, either, so it was only natural that Hysteria was the same.

In fact, Hysteria had potentially transformed into a dimension to avoid being attacked upon the destruction of the Genesis World. Its dimension was far too large, so it was indeed possible for it to avoid this calamity if it hid itself in some corner of the dimension.

“Very well. I accept your proposal,” Lin Luo said, becoming the first ultimate elite to nod his head in approval.

“I also accept it,” Zhou Heng said with a nod.

“Accepted,” Chu Hao said, becoming the third person to vote.

Xin Fu and the three others hesitated for a brief moment before eventually nodding slowly.

Since Ling Han could still grow stronger, they might as well go all in on him.

“Since we’ve come to a consensus, let’s get a move on now. Don’t waste any time,” Lin Luo said.

They didn’t ask anyone else for their opinion. If one weren’t at the Seventh Tier, one wouldn’t have the right to discuss these things with the ultimate elites.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were gods among the Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han traveled through the dimensions, and relocated all the important people to the Celestial Realm first.

He couldn’t help but feel slightly emotional after returning to this familiar place. After traveling to so many places, was he ultimately going to resolve everything here?

The other Heavenly Venerates naturally received news of the situation as well, so they all started to relocate to the Celestial Realm with their clans and families. To put it simply, everyone was trying their best to relocate as many people as they could. These were all living and feeling beings, so it was only natural that they wanted to save as many of them as possible. These people were all seeds of hope for the future.

After resolving this potential worry, Ling Han entered seclusion and started to cultivate.

The most important thing right now was his battle prowess. If he could wield a crushing power superior to that of his enemies, then he could naturally resolve all of the problems that they faced.

Before entering seclusion, there was one matter that caused him to become slightly distracted—Wang Quanhe had disappeared.

Ling Han couldn’t find him no matter what, and it was as if he had simply vanished from the face of the world. It was as if he had never existed in the first place.

However, he was a powerful Heavenly Venerate who was more than capable of protecting himself, and he was also a shockingly fortunate person who always came across rare opportunities. Thus, he most likely wouldn’t face any danger.

Ling Han pondered this for a short moment before waving away his worries for this descendant. He officially entered seclusion.

He aroused all of the Heavenly Venerable Seals inside him, and used them to interact with the void, extracting a vast amount of fundamental power to temper his body.

Meanwhile, his dimensions also started to develop with vigor, actively drawing energy from the void by themselves. They then transformed this energy into nutrients that could help them grow.

Since these dimensions contained life force now, would it be possible for him to place living beings inside?

Ling Han was contemplating, contemplating the worst-case scenario where they failed to stop Hysteria. At that time, he would transform himself into a Genesis World to hold all living beings.

“Let’s hope we never reach that stage.”

With this in mind, Ling Han decided to give it a test. He drew the Empress and the others into a dimension in his cell.

The result was… a success.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. This meant that as long as he remained alive and undestroyed, those he cared about would also be able to stay safe forever.

He focused his attention on cultivation. It was already a foregone conclusion that the Profound Negative Realm would be destroyed by Hysteria. That being the case, they definitely had to snatch the core of the dimension as this would allow them to nurture several more Seventh Tier elites.

Moreover, this might also allow Ling Han to elevate his cultivation and reach the peak stage of the Sixth Tier.

Time, what he needed was time.

Time flew by, and 600,000,000 years passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, Ling Han received news that the Profound Negative Realm had almost completely been engulfed by Hysteria already. The core of the dimension was about to appear.

‘Time to set off!’

Ling Han, Lin Luo, and the other Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates arrived at the Profound Negative Realm. Right now, this transcendent dimension was already unable to live up to its name. It was so small that it could only compare to a small city.
