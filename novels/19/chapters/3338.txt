Chapter 3339: Underground Battle Arena

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

They could actually place bets?

Realization dawned on Ling Han. Merely setting up an Underground Battle Arena and collecting entrance fees could earn some profit, but the majority of it should be spent on the army. Only by starting a gamble, and being the banker, would one be able to make a lot of money.

—Even the contestants had been arranged by the tournament authorities, so how easy would it be to cheat?

Ling Han smiled and said, “There should also be shares of your Xuanyuan Clan in this, right?”

“Hehe, it was Second Brother who is our representative. Father should know, but he has never asked before, so he just pretends he doesn’t know,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said with a smile. He now had improved pill recipes, which was equivalent to printing money. He could not be any richer, so he would not be interested in this arena.

The two new competitors entered the arena. This time, however, it was Blood Transformation Tier-level. The battle didn’t begin immediately, and everyone was given time to place their bets.

The options for placing bets were also varied. For example, how many minutes would the battle take? Would Xin Si be hit in the abdomen, or would Ma Jiu’s foot be injured? It was definitely not just a matter of who would win out of the two of them.

The stakes for this kind of strange method of betting were very high, but the chances of winning were also very low. It was precisely because of this that the arena could earn money, and take advantage of the gamblers’ mentality of wanting to get instant riches.

Ling Han didn’t lack money, so he naturally wouldn’t place a bet. He was wearing a mask now, and as a disciple of the Imperial Capital Academy, if he were to be exposed for participating in a battle like this, it would mean great trouble.

Because Ling Han possessed the battle prowess of Extreme Bone Tier, his battle would also be the climax.

The battle between Ma Jiu and Xin Si was extremely intense. The contestants here would only use their surnames as code names, such as Ma Yi?. In future, if another person with the surname Ma came, his name would be Ma Er, and so

on?.

Right at this moment, another group of people entered. The one in the lead was a man who looked to be in his thirties. He was dressed in embroidered robes, and had a domineering air about him.

However, it was as if the few people behind him were esteemed guests. Though he had come in first, the moment he entered, he very eagerly made way for those people behind him.

“Qin Zhengchu!” Xuanyuan Dingguo’s expression immediately turned ugly when he saw this. In fact, he was gritting his teeth in anger.

“A descendant of General Vajra?” Ling Han asked.

“En, the 19th son of General Vajra, extremely arrogant,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said, appearing extremely disdainful. “Amongst the many children of General Vajra, this person is the most unbearable.”

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “An old grudge?

“En, the grudge is not too light either.” Xuanyuan Dingguo humphed.

Though the two of them looked young, they were both the sons of Great Generals. Usually, they would be doted on, so it was naturally impossible for them to submit to each other. It was very easy for conflicts to arise.

“Who are those people?” Ling Han looked towards those people behind din Zhengchu. They were all wearing cloaks over their heads, and one could only tell that they were astonishingly tall, but their appearances could not be seen at all.

It was very easy to think that they had all come to participate in the underground tournament, but if it was only contestants, would Qin Zhengchu still be so polite to them?

They found seats and sat down. Coincidentally, they were very close to Ling Han and Xuanyuan Dingguo.

“Xuanyuan Dingguo, why are you here as well?” Qin Zhengchu glanced sideways at Xuanyuan Dingguo. It was obvious that he had deliberately found this spot after discovering him.

“You can come, and I can’t? What a joke!” Xuanyuan Dingguo said coldly. The two of them were indeed enemies. The moment they saw each other, they began to argue.

“Yi, this is your new lover?” Qin Zhengchu glanced at Ling Han, his tone filled with contempt, directly pouring slander on Ling Han.

“Qin Zhengchu, your mouth is really despicable!” Xuanyuan Dingguo humphed. “Hahahaha, that gay over there-” Qin Zhengchu said to Ling Han, “Come, I’ll give you a million, and you immediately dump this guy.” Ling Han looked towards Qin Zhengchu. Xuanyuan Dingguo wasn’t wrong. This person really had a despicable mouth. If it wasn’t due to General Vajra, he would probably have been hacked to death several hundred times over.

It was fine had he not provoked him. He wasn’t the type to swallow his anger.

To say nothing of Qin Zhengchu, even his old man was someone that Ling Han wanted to defeat. Since he had promised Niu Huaqing, he would definitely have a battle with General Vajra.

“Apologize!” Ling Han stared at Qin Zhengchu and said coldly. “Yo, Xuanyuan, your new lover is quite hot-tempered!” Qin Zhengchu was completely unconcerned, and continued to tease him, madly attracting animosity for himself.

With a thought from Ling Han, his blood and Qi surged, turning into a gigantic silver Demonic Monkey that pounced towards Qin Zhengchu. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

How could Qin Zhengchu have foreseen that Ling Han would suddenly make a move? Moreover, the oppressive aura of Ling Han could practically ignore distance, and arrive in an instant. Qin Zhengchu was completely unprepared, and his face instantly turned pale.

The barrage of murderous aura was the unique ability of Blood Transformation Tier. Although it didn’t cause much damage, it could make one’s limbs weak, and even make them lie on the ground.

Qin Zhengchu was the son of General Vajral, after all. No matter how disdainful he was, he still had some strength. With the cultivation level of Fifth Change, there was no way he would be scared into submission by Ling Han’s aura.

Even so, his whole body was trembling, and no matter what, he did not dare to look into Ling Han’s eyes again.

“Yi, you actually know the techniques of the Demon Race!” A cloaked person suddenly spoke up.

“Young Master Hu, the trait of a Third Change Blood Transformation Tier is Condensed Blood Beast, so it’s not strange for it to take the form of the Demon Race, right?” another cloaked person said. His status should be slightly inferior.

The first cloaked person shook his head, “This is not just an empty image, but also possesses divine power, so it is definitely not just a projection of a Demonic Monkey, but rather that he has cultivated the corresponding technique!”

Ling Han was astounded. This person’s insight was truly remarkable. He didn’t deliberately condense his blood and Qi into some kind of beast, but it rather naturally transformed into the form of a Demonic Monkey. This should be related to the Demonic Monkey Fists that he cultivated. It was a little deeply ingrained in him.

“Hand over the technique that you are cultivating,” the first cloaked person said calmly as he looked at Ling Han.

Xuanyuan Dingguo couldn’t help but interrupt, saying, “Who do you think you are? You actually dare to make my brother hand over the technique he’s cultivating?”

“How dare you!” Aside from Young Master Hu, the other cloaked figures all stood up at this moment, pointing angrily at Xuanyuan Dingguo.

At first, Qin Zhengchu’s face was filled with anger after he had trembled, but now, he revealed a cold smirk. Since these esteemed guests were already on opposing sides with Xuanyuan Dingguo, there was no need for him to interfere. He only had to watch the show.

Who had Xuanyuan Dingguo been afraid of?

Aside from the few Imperial Princes that were older, he was not afraid of anyone else. What was there to be afraid of?

“What is it? Can’t I speak?” Xuanyuan Dingguo asked calmly as he drank. Xuanyuan Dingguo had calmed down instead.

“Ignore him, he’s just a reckless idiot.” Young Master Hu waved his hand. He only stared at Ling Han. The more he recalled the scene just now, the more he felt that the Demonic Monkey’s form was filled with intelligence, and had a kind of viciousness and dominance. It was definitely an extraordinary seed from the ancient times.

“Yes, Young Master Hu,” the other cloaked figures all answered solemnly. Young Master Hu didn’t say anything else, and merely smiled at Ling Han. There was no need to rush. This person couldn’t fly, so how could he run now that he had his eye on him?
