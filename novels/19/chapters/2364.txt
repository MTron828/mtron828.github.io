Chapter 2365: I am

It could be said that it was already a miracle itself that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had been able to last so long; it had already been over a dozen epochs! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Han was incredibly impressed, and bowed towards Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. “Senior is virtuous and honorable. This junior is impressed.”

If Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had not made sacrifices over a dozen epochs ago, would he still have existed?

To say nothing of him, even the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable could not have possibly appeared, either. History would have long since been rewritten.

Yet Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s demeanor was solemn. “I can’t last for much longer, so you must return to the Celestial Realm at the first opportunity, and ask a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to interfere and disturb Desolate Eternity. Adding cooperation from my side, we will definitely be able to ruin his plans.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. “This junior cannot return to the Celestial Realm, because an energy storm has presently filled the connecting point of the two realms.”

“What!?” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le couldn’t help but exclaim.

Ling Han added some details to how he had fled from the Celestial Realm. Previously, he had only mentioned that he had been forced to flee, but had not described how he had fled.

The Heavenly Venerate Wu Le could not speak. Ling Han was merely at the Ascending Origin Tier. Even if Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was caught completely off guard, Ling Han could not possibly get within 300 meters of him. He would be destroyed by the might of Heavenly Venerable Tier long before that.

Could it be that this was the only outcome?

He was merely a spiritual mark, and did not have any power at all. Furthermore, he had just barely extracted this spiritual mark while he was clashing with the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity with his full efforts. Moreover, he could only manifest occasionally for just a short while.

He just happened to catch sight of how Ling Han kidnapped the human slaves, and had thus become curious about him. He observed attentively, and when he descovered Ling Han’s similar actions a second time, he took the risk to appear and test the waters.

If this matter was known to the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le would definitely be suppressed even harsher, and it would not be possible any longer for him to send out a sliver of divine sense.

Yet Ling Han could not return to the Celestial Realm, and this sliver of divine sense of Wu Le had no battle prowess at all. Then, weren’t they completely helpless?

Even if he was a Heavenly Venerate, he couldn’t help but feel hopeless.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. “I may have a way.”

He decided to go all out, and use the final bit of power of the Black Tower.

Otherwise, if the Celestial Realm was destroyed, he and the women would only be islands without roots, completely left without anyone to rely on.

When he thought he had ruined the plans of Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, the old geezer turned out to be using a smokescreen. He talked about how he was researching a way to make it so that beings of the Foreign Realm needed not fear being targeted by the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm, but was actually only referring to himself.

Once he succeeded, he would only enter the Celestial Realm alone, and he would definitely obtain profits that the other Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t even be able to dream of.

Ling Han was certain that all the Heavenly Venerates were united on the matter of invading the Celestial Realm, but to say that they were all close and intimate friends? Ling Han would never believe that. This was practically a humongous joke.

There were greater things at stake, and Ling Han had made his decision, which could not be wavered.

“You?” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le shook his head. He was not underestimating Ling Han, but what could a mere Ascending Origin Tier do?

“I have a precious Heavenly Venerable Tier Tool, and when I activate it, I can unleash Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier battle prowess.” Ling Han revealed his trump card.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le couldn’t help but feel surprised. “You actually have such good fortune, brat?”

The precious Tool of a Heavenly Venerate plus the Divine Demon Sword that was still at the level of a Celestial Tool. Who knew, they might become two precious Heavenly Venerable Tier Tools in the future!

He began pondering, and he finally nodded after a while. “This could be possible. We have to plan carefully.”

The senior and junior did not immediately begin, because the divine sense of the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le could not manifest for too long. If the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity discovered that the other party still had the slightest sliver of mobility, their plans would all come to nothing.

And Ling Han could not stay here too long, either. The matter of great number of humans once again disappearing would be exposed soon, and he had to quickly return to his quarters.

However, he now knew that the absence of these humans could not cause any problem to the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. He was only using these humans as a cover whose purpose was to conceal the existence of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le.

…When Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had been severely wounded, it had to be that his body just happened to be refined by Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, and it was not known to the other Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerates. Otherwise, a “Heavenly Venerate corpse” would definitely be scrambled over madly by the Heavenly Venerates.

Even if Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was even stronger, he would only be able to obtain just that slight bit more, obtaining a leg, an arm, or something of the sort.

Ling Han returned to his quarters, and did not inform the three women of this matter so that they would not worry. He only told them to make preparations as they would be leaving here at any time.

Of course, there was also Wally. The knowledge that this guy possessed was really too useful.

A great number of human slaves had once again disappeared. Divine Desolate Mountain naturally exploded at this. What brazen criminal actually dared to wreak havoc twice on Divine Desolate Mountain?

The two Ancestral Kings searched high and low, and even all the disciples of the Heavenly Venerate could not escape from suspicion. They were requested to hand over their Spatial God Tools for inspection. However, Ling Han had the Black Tower, and as long as they were not Heavenly Venerates, no one could tell it was there. He easily passed the inspection.

Now, the whole Divine Desolate Mountain had entered once more into a state of vigilance. Both Ancestral Kings felt vexed, and even had plans to request the return of several senior brothers at the Eighteenth Lotus to investigate this matter.

Ling Han’s heart was calm. In any case, he would not be able to stay for much longer here, and once he used the great burst of the Black Tower, he would deifnitely kill several Foreign Realm monarch stars while he was at it, such as Xue Ge. The latter had devoured a human right in front of him, and Ling Han’s killing intent blazed at this.

Another dozen-plus days later, the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le finally manifested once more, and discussed the plan with Ling Han. It was mainly him talking, and organizing the details of Ling Han’s actions and where he would go after he succeeded.

Ling Han planned to go to the Dark Inverse Realm because there was no way back.

However, the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le shook his head. “I am already at the end of my line, and after I escape, I will deliver you back to the Celestial Realm. Though the energy storm will cause severe injury to me, I no longer care.”

“Senior…” Ling Han was moved. Seeing Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s actions, the latter planned to follow in the steps of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and fuse himself with Heavenly Dao to damage the connecting point of the two realms, giving more time to the Celestial Realm.

“No need to say further. I have decided!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le declared resolutely.

Ling Han could only respectfully bow towards him. The Heavenly Venerates of the older generation did not just consist of selfish people like Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. There were also greatly honorable and virtuous beings like Heavenly Venerate Wu Le and the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

“Brat, you are able too.” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le looked at Ling Han smilingly. He had a very high opinion of Ling Han, who had been able to escape into the Foreign Realm all alone, and still managed to live so well. How many could do the same?

The two appreciated each other’s talent. Though the difference in their cultivation levels was like the gap between heaven and earth, and the same applied to their age, they became firm comrades because they held the same faith.

After going through al the details, Ling Han made his final preparations, and drew the three women and Little Terror back into the Black Tower while also having Wally turn into an ornament that hung from his robes.

He prepared… to act tomorrow night.

Day and night existed on Divine Desolate Mountain, but daytime lasted as long as three days, while night only lasted one night, i.e. had normal length. This was the power of a Heavenly Venerable Tier.

A day passed very quickly, and Ling Han moved out.

This time, he made no attempts to hide himself. Who knew what corner the sliver of divine sense of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was roaming around now? Furthermore, his true self was presently working hard to refine the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. He was definitely “paying no attention to outside matters.”

The rest were all mediocre, and he could suppress all of them by simply using the power of the Black Tower.

“Ba, what are you doing outside at such a late hour?” An angry rebuke rang out, and Feng Hailuan appeared. He looked coldly at Ling Han. “Could it be that you are that great thief?”

The latter’s words were naturally his deliberate attempt to smear Ling Han’s name.

Ling Han grinned. “That’s right, I am!”
