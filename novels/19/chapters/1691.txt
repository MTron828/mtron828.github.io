Chapter 1692: Deciding the plan

This guy was really not pretentious at all.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “We can share wine, but forget about courting girls.”

“Hahaha, what meaning is there in merely drinking wine together?” Duan Jun scoffed immediately. “Are you so lacking in charm that no women are willing to throw themselves into your arms, so you are afraid of being humiliated? Don’t worry, just follow me, Brother Jun, and I guarantee that women will love you.”

At this time, Duan Wen couldn’t help but cough. ‘It’s enough that you lost, and you are still publicly asking the other to share wine and court girls together with you here; is that really proper...? But that’s fine too. The friendship between men is developed through sharing wine and courting women together.’

Ling Han was definitely worth attracting, and Duan Jun’s ability to make friends had always been trustworthy.

The competition ended, and the reserve team had emerged victorious in a manner that no one could have possibly imagined, achieving the first place. They had also won the chance to participate in the major tournament in Black Moon City and the qualification to compete with prodigies that had come from over 200 other cities.

This was too unexpected.

Initially, allowing the reserve team to take part was for the sake of balance and fairness, but who would have imagined that this year’s reserve team would actually be so powerful—in truth, it was completely because of a single person that they forcefully took the first place.

The three great clans all began a discussion centered around Ling Han. Both the Long Clan and Duan Clan undoubtedly prepared amazing conditions to draw Ling Han into their camp. As for the Ding Clan, they conducted a fierce debate, discussing whether they would execute a strategy of beating down on Ling Han or to attract him into their ranks.

In the end, the strategy to beat down on Ling Han got the upper hand because the relations the Ding Clan had with Ling Han were already very poor, so even if they tried to draw him, they would definitely have less competitive power than the Duan Clan and Long Clan, so they might as well snip this bud while it had yet to bloom, and there was no need for further argument.

Just look, Mao Dai’s appearance had already affected the balance between the three great clans. Whichever clan he joined, that clan’s strength would rise above the others because Mao Dai had a very high chance of becoming a fourth severance grand elder.

Without a doubt, as long as Ling Han managed to mature, he was practically a second Mao Dai, or perhaps even better!

Just thinking that a day like that would come, the Ding Clan felt slightly anxious.

“Don’t forget, Mao Dai still has an unmarried daughter.” Ding Hu naturally supported the idea of becoming enemies with Ling Han. He menacingly said, “A few days ago, it was also Mao Dai’s personal command that transferred me out of the reserve camp, and he even summoned that brat for a personal audience.”

“Hiss, what you mean is that Mao Dai also has his eye on this brat, and has the intention to marry off his daughter to him?” Ding Gang, who was also a first severance grand elder, exclaimed in surprise.

The higher-ups all looked at each other, and they could see the seriousness in each other’s expressions.

“Mao Dai has three and a half stars aptitude, and would advance into the fourth severance in less than a few hundred million years! And that damn brat also has three and a half stars aptitude, and I even suspect that he had not shown his full potential. His true aptitude should be above even this.

“By then, two fourth severance grand elders would appear in the Mao Clan, and the power structure of Dark Moon City would have to be rewritten.”

Even as strong as the Ding Clan was, they only had a single fourth severance grand elder, and that was Ding Yaolong. Though a few fourth severance grand elders had appeared continuously in the history of the Ding Clan, they all did not manage to cross over the step of Dividing Soul Tier, and ultimately died in the Immortal’s Tribulation.

In the Celestial Realm, time was still incredibly valuable. Even if you had an endless lifespan, if you could not ensure that your cultivation level continued to advance, you would ultimately be taken back by the heaven and earth.

“Mao Dai has a disciple that is quite interested in Mao Dai’s little girl,” Ding Yaolong said suddenly.

“Ancestor, what you mean is to think of a way to have Mao Dai’s disciple and that girl from the Mao Clan to become husband and wife?” Ding Hu asked respectfully. In that manner, Ling Han could not possibly become Mao Dai’s firm ally.

Ding Yaolong smiled calmly, and said, “No, think of a way to have Ling Han and the little girl of Mao Clan become a couple.”

Ah!

All the higher-ups exchanged looks, feeling baffled.

Weren’t they afraid that Mao Dai would become allies with Ling Han? The two of them both had three and a half stars aptitude, and if they were allied, they could be nature-defying.

Pa, pa, pa. Someone broke out in applause and laughed out loud. “Smart, this is really smart. This move from Ancestor is really incredibly smart!”

All the higher-ups turned to look at that person. ‘You don’t have to be so gross in how you’re sucking up to Ancestor, right?’

That person explained, “The key is that the disciple of Mao Dai, Zhang Chong, right, likes that little girl of the Mao Clan very much. If we could have Ling Han, that damn brat, defile the little girl of the Mao Clan, just think, what would Zhang Chong do?”

“Kill that brat, of course!” someone immediately answered.

Haha, then wouldn’t this lead to internal strife between Mao Dai and Ling Han?

Even if Mao Dai thought that what was done was done, and just made the best of things by marrying his daughter to Ling Han, would Zhang Chong be able to take this lying down? This guy could apparently advance into the Severing Mundane Tier this time round, and by then, killing Ling Han would merely be a piece of cake for him.

“Hehe, hehehehe!” These higher-ups all laughed. This was what was called killing two birds with one stone. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As for how much hurt Mao Shuyu would endure in this matter, how could that be any consideration of these people?

In their eyes, there was only profit. For the sake of profit, they could even sacrifice their own clansmen, what more when it was an outsider.

“Then we will execute this plan after Zhang Chong advances into the Severing Mundane Tier to ensure that there will be no mistakes.”

***

With Ling Han’s strong insistence, the Empress went with him, heading to Black Moon City.

...How could he not bring her along with him? By now, Ling Han was completely hostile with the Ding Clan, and if he left, what if the Ding Clan harmed the Empress? In front of a Severing Mundane Ancestor, no matter how much a prodigy the Empress was, she would not have any ability to resist.

Ling Han did not want anything that would cause him eternal regret to happen. Even if the Empress had to become a military deserter, he would bring her with him inside the Black Tower.

Thankfully, the great commander of the Dark Moon Army was Mao Dai. Though he was merely a figurehead, he still had that little bit of power.

Duan Jun had indeed pulled Ling Han along with him to have wine, and even invited more than a dozen delicate beauties who were also very unreserved from a few minor clans of the city. When they saw Ling Han and Duan Jun, they would call them Brother Jun and Brother Han, looking like they were ready to accept their advances as long as they were willing.

Duan Jun set himself free completely, having a woman on either side of him, and taking full advantage of them. However, he did not go too far, and did not overdo things with these women, which made these delicate misses all feel very resentful.

Ling Han was even more direct; he was cold and kept all of them at a very far distance. To be honest, even if he was the lascivious type, with such an exquisite beauty like the Empress, would he still be attracted by such mediocre beauties?

Duan Jun was quite a likable person. He was incredibly outspoken, and not the type to beat around the bush with his words. This was very suited to Ling Han’s tastes. Thus, the two of them had a great conversation, and drank to their hearts’ content.

After preparing for 10 days, the 10 members of the reserve troops led by Long Gaofei set out, heading towards Black Moon City.

They boarded a large ship. Otherwise, the time needed for the journey on foot would be much, much too long. This was the Celestial Realm; that mediocre speed of Genesis Tier was really inadequate.

The large ship was huge. It was as long as 30,000 meters, and also a few thousand meters wide. If it stood upright, then it would be a majestic mountain, but in this great lake that was akin to an ocean, this was not the slightest bit eye-catching.

The waves swept towards them, and the body of the ship swayed strongly. Even Ling Han’s expression shifted slightly at that feeling of power. This was defintiely something that could threaten his Godly bones!
