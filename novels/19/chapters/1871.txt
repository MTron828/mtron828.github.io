Chapter 1872: Showing off their respective strength

On the spectators’ seats, a round of cheers suddenly rose up.

For ordinary spectators, they were not concerned who would win or lose. As long as they could see an exciting battle, they would be satisfied.

After spending so much money, what they wanted to see was blood spilling and flesh tearing!

And now Ling Han’s blood was finally spilt, which naturally caused their emotions to climax instantly.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” some were shouting with bloodshot eyes. That frantic madness was no less than that of Zhao Qingfeng himself, if not more.

Sun Dong also belonged to them. As he yelled, he was still waving his arms in excitement.

Pa, Lu Xianming immediately delivered a slap at him.

Sun Dong’s whole person spun around on the spot from the impact. Then, he was baffled, and asked in confusion, “Holy Son, why did you hit me?” He felt very innocently wronged.

Lu Xianming humphed. As one of superior status, did he have to give his subordinates an explanation?

‘If you can’t discern my body language, you still think of becoming my trusted aide?

‘Idiot!’

Although Sun Dong had a fondness for women, he was a very clever man. When he realized that Lu Xianming was showing a strong displeasure, he hurriedly murmured his apologies. As for the reason, that could be discussed later.

On the other side, Cheng Fengyun was even more excited. Because of Ling Han, he had suffered a lot. The noble young master of Cheng Clan actually had to eat rock, slap himself, and even run naked. How could that be endured?

After being repressed for 10 days, his emotions exploded in an instant, which naturally made him exhilarated to the extreme.

“Kill! Zhao Qingfeng, kill!” he shouted, his face flushed red. Even the veins below his skin were popping, and it was very possible that his heart would explode due to overexcitement.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was even more anxious, and thought, ‘Why has this idiot not admitted defeat yet? Does he want to be beaten to death?

‘Why are you being so stubborn!’

To say nothing of her, even Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was a little uncertain. Though she knew Ling Han’s strength very well, Zhao Qingfeng’s battle prowess was too vicious, and he had indeed wounded Ling Han with a single strike.

She couldn’t help but worry, her pretty face showing her anxiety.

“Brother, this brat can’t hold on for much longer!” Shantian Wu said excitedly.

Under his brother’s abuse of authority, he no longer dared to make a move on Ling Han. However, that did not mean that he did not hate Ling Han anymore. Now, as he watched Ling Han suffer an injury, it was as if he had been injected with adrenaline. That was how excited he was.

Meanwhile, Shantian Jiu was much more reserved. He smiled slightly, yet in his heart, he thought that all this was only a matter of course.

Zhao Qingfeng was too strong, and even the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of Celestial King Tier-level sects had been instantly defeated by him. At most, Ling Han could only be the Holy Son from a Celestial King Tier-level force. Faced with Zhao Qingfeng, It was definite that he would be outmatched.

To last for so long before finally sustaining injuries was already very much beyond his expectations.

Even those powerful figures nodded their heads continuously. Zhao Qingfeng’s strength had already reached the peak stage of the Severing Mundane Tier, and had in fact surpassed that! Because there was a large vacuum of battle prowess between the Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier, the present Zhao Qingfeng was within this vacuum.

How could he not be strong?

The spectators’ cheers seemed capable of crumbling mountains and overturning seas. There were practically not many here that knew Ling Han, so they naturally would not be cheering for him. They were all leaning in favor of the elite. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhao Qingfeng!”

“Zhao Qingfeng!”

“Zhao Qingfeng!”

Everyone all cheered together, as if wanting to shatter the sky itself.

Zhao Qingfeng bared his teeth in a menacing grin, and raised the sword to level, aiming straight at Ling Han. “If you can’t completely ignite my Dao Heart, what meaning is there for you to continue living? Just die!”

He roared, and charged towards Ling Han.

“Scram!” Ling Han roared furiously. Brandishing his sword, he received the incoming attack. The brightness of lightning exploded madly, and fiery flames were still burning within. He, too, had channeled his Divine Sword, and used the Regulations of Fire.

...He kept feeling that Zhao Qingfeng had not used his full strength. Thus, he, too, had only channeled the Regulations of Lightning all this while, exchanging blows with the other.

Now, since the other had revealed his trump card, he, too, began to unleash his true battle prowess.

‘You want to break through? So do I, so let’s just see who will become the stepping stone for the other.’

Boom!

The two swords clashed, and a brilliant light surged out from the point where the blades clashed. Very soon, a pinpoint of light turned into a massive ball of light, which then turned into a terrifying explosion, sweeping out in all directions.

Peng, peng, peng. All around the arena, multiple formation patterns lit up, blocking the shock wave that had gone berserk.

Even so, the spectators were all dazed, and looked completely beside themselves.

Too strong, really too f****** strong!

Was this really the strength that a Severing Mundane Tier should have?

What was more frightening was that Ling Han actually turned his dire situation around. His whole body was burning with fiery flames, bestowing his brilliance on the world like a sun god.

In this exchange, it was still Ling Han that was at a disadvantage, but it was no longer one-sided.

This was a worthy battle!

On the spectators’ seats, the powerful figures all closed their mouths, sinking into silence.

After a long while, the shortie with braided hair finally said, “This brat is still only a third severance peak stage.”

Ling Han’s strength naturally would not be taken to heart by these powerful figures, but the problem here was that there was a third severance peak stage cultivator that had actually also stepped into the vacuum between Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier. This was really too exaggerating.

Then when you advanced into the fourth severance, could it be that you would be able to match the Dividing Soul Tier?

“Matching Dividing Soul Tier is impossible. Even Yan Xianlu could not possibly fight a Dividing Soul Tier opponent while he is still at the fourth severance. He would only be able to defeat all other Severing Mundane Tiers,” a powerful figure spoke up. “Unless...”

“...he can advance into the fifth severance!” several mighty figures said at the same time.

But when they said this, they all shook their heads. This was a possibility that was close to zero.

“Hehe, since you all don’t have a high opinion of this kid, I will take him as my disciple then,” the shortie with braided hair said.

“Old geezer Hu, the height of battle prowess is one story, but what does that have to do with taking disciples?” An elder with a tall build hurriedly jumped in. “This brat, I, too, have the interest to take him as my disciple!”

“I, on the other hand, do not want to take him as my disciple. However, I would like to take him in as a son-in-law!” another powerful figure said.

Suddenly, all these big shots were arguing with red faces.

“Hahahaha, this only makes it interesting!” Zhao Qingfeng was not stunned because of Ling Han’s aggressive counterattack. Instead, he looked delighted. Only if Ling Han was strong enough could he completely arouse his murderous heart.

“Die!” He charged over, laughing madly. He brandished his sword in a swipe, and delivered millions and millions of flashes of Sword Qi that filled the entire arena.

This was the range of his Sword Qi.

Because he was a Metal Element Divine Fetus, he was born with an affinity with metal, and could easily manipulate it at his slightest whim.

And now, all the Metal Element of the heaven and earth had turned into Sword Qi, and added with his control of Regulations at the fourth severance, this destructive power was unimaginable.

Shua, all the Sword Qi shot out simultaneously, wanting to turn Ling Han into a beehive.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. The Sword Qi descended together, turning into a massive ball of blades, and Ling Han was completely drowned in it.

“Is he dead yet?” On the spectators’ seats, everyone was holding their breath. This kind of battle was really too intense, too exciting, and they had even forgotten to breathe.

Boom!

Suddenly, a pillar of flame burst out from within the ball of blades, melting the ball of blades with its heat. Ling Han was standing proudly there, completely unwounded.

Gasp!

The spectators all exclaimed in shock. This was a little too strong, wasn’t it.

This Ling Han... who exactly was he? Could it be that he was the Holy Son from some Celestial King Tier-level sect, and had deliberately concealed his identity?

Yet Zhao Qingfeng only laughed maniacally, and pounced, brandishing his sword in a swift slash. HIs murderous heart was blazing. Ling Han’s strength had already caused his killing intent to completely boil over, and now the only thing left was to deliver the killing strike on Ling Han so he could be completely refined.
