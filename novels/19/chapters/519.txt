Chapter 520: Bo Family’s Seventh Young Master

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Haha, that’s Bo Family’s seventh young master, known for being domineering.”

“After not seeing Lady Shuang Shuang for three consecutive days, Bo Yong Feng’s mood was terrible to begin with. This guy’s hit the muzzle.”

“Bo Family’s one of the seven great familiess in the Imperial City, with a Spiritual Pedestal Tier elite keeping watch. Even the royal family has to give some face... so what if they kill someone?”

“It’s over, it’s over for this guy.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, delighting in Ling Han’s misfortune. They were in a bad mood that Ling Han could enter Yun Shuang Shuang’s manor by himself. They simply didn’t have guts like Bo Yong Feng, daring to attack publicly.

Xiu , a sword came; the chilling Qi was like a sharp saber.

Ling Han shook his head. He originally only wanted to teach the other party a lesson, but since this person attacked aiming to take his life, he obviously would show no mercy. With a casual flick of a finger, a forceful gust of wind was fired out, and with a pu , the sword that immediately reversed and pierced Bo Yong Feng’s forehead, coming right out the other end.

The head was pierced thoroughly, so the person was definitely dead.

Bo Yong Feng looked blankly at Ling Han, as if unable to believe that he would die in such a way. Two streams of blood tears flowed from his eyes as his body fell towards the ground, pa , raising the dust off the ground.

Instantly, all voices disappeared, and only the sound of heavy breathing was left.

Bo Yong Feng definitely didn’t count as an elite in the Imperial City, but cultivation of the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier wasn’t low, either. Moreover, Ling Han was young, looking eighteen to nineteen years old, so how strong could he possibly be?

However, as it happened, he killed Bo Yong Feng with a single finger!

Bo Yong Feng, an outstanding figure amongst the younger generation in the Bo Family. Although he pursued carnal pleasures, wasn’t this normal for youngsters? Bo Family had placed high expectations on this family member that was extremely likely to become a Spiritual Pedestal Tier being.

However, it was obviously all void now.

Such great nerve, to kill even Bo Family’s young master. This thing was serious; Bo Family’s rage would shake the entire Imperial City.

In the manor, on the balcony, Yun Shuang Shuang and the sisters were watching Ling Han leave, but after seeing this scene, they were also shocked, with their small mouths open wide... this guy attacked too viciously, killing the person right away. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This guy can stir up trouble better than me!” Liu Ru Er muttered.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Anyone else wants to stop me?”

Everyone hurriedly shook their heads in unison. Amongst the younger generation, Spiritual Ocean Tier experts hadn’t appeared, so no one dared to make an enemy of Ling Han.

Killing Bo Yong Feng in one move, everyone obviously assumed that Ling Han was a Spiritual Ocean Tier expert; based on his age, this was already an overestimation.

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said to Hu Niu.

“Yes!” Hu Niu agreed in a clear and bright voice, following behind Ling Han.

Everyone could only watch them go, and only after Ling Han left did they realize their backs were covered in cold sweat. They hurriedly dispersed in an uproar. Bo Family’s young master was killed, so they obviously had to spread the news out; otherwise, if the murderer escaped, the Bo Family might take their anger out on them.

“Sister, I just realized, I actually can’t see through this guy’s cultivation!” Liu Ru Er suddenly said.

Liu Feng Er also nodded, and said, “I’m already at the Spiritual Ocean Tier, but I still can’t see through Young Master Han’s cultivation. Could it be...”

The sisters looked at each other and said simultaneously, “The Spiritual Pedestal Tier!”

“That’s impossible, Young Master Han’s only so old; two years ago, he was still just at the Element Gathering Tier. How could he now be at the Spiritual Pedestal Tier?” Yun Shuang Shuang said in disbelief.

“That’s right.” The sisters shook their heads; this was certainly too ridiculous.

“Aiya, we have to go. Bo Yong Feng died here, and if the investigation leads to us, we’re doomed.” The Liu sisters left hastily; they were fugitives.

...

Ling Han and Hu Niu strolled about. Their next target was fifteen thousand meters east of the Imperial City, the mineshaft which had been exploited thousands of years ago. It had some strange metal ores, but due to an ominous accident, the mineshaft had been sealed long ago. Only in the recent half a year was it reopened.

Very soon, Ling Han discovered pursuers behind them, but he didn’t pay attention to it. In the small Fire Country, no one could pose a threat to him.

After exiting the city gates, he and Hu Niu continued east, and immediately saw a crimson red mist that covered the sky; it was impenetrable even with Ling Han’s eyesight.

“Hmm?” Ling Han was slightly surprised.

“There, very not good, not good!” Hu Niu shook her head and revealed a vigilant expression.

Even Hu Niu said so!

Ling Han was even more shocked; Hu Niu feared nothing in heaven or earth. At that time, she skipped and jumped about inside the Demonic Qi, but now she actually showed fear. Apparently, this mineshaft was truly something more than met the eye.

Looks like he somewhat underestimated Na Zhi Yan.

Clearly knowing that people died here every day, he was still bent on excavating. Could some treasure be buried within the mine? However, looking at the pervasive crimson Qi, this probably wasn’t a treasure, but an ominous thing instead.

A greatly ominous thing!

“Even more so a reason to go see it.” Ling Han nodded. His parents and family were all here; he was afraid that something similar to that of a Thousand Corpse Sect conspiracy would happen, making the entire desolate north a land of the dead; the lurking perils had to be eliminated.

“Niu Niu, want to enter the Black Tower first?” Ling Han asked.

Hu Niu bit on her finger, thinking, and said, “No need for now!”

In other words, when they really entered the mineshaft, or stayed there for too long, even Hu Niu would possibly not be able to endure it.

Ling Han became even more vigilant, but fortunately, those who entered the mineshaft suddenly died only on the second day they came out; so as long as it wasn’t instant death, he could enter the Black Tower and invoke its power to resist whatever threat that would be.

He and Hu NIu walked towards the mineshaft, but more and more people tailed them and were becoming bolder, no longer in fear of being discovered by Ling Han.

When they almost arrived at the mineshaft, ten people caught up to them.

“Halt!” a middle-aged man yelled loudly and caught up in a few large strides. His face was ashen and killing intent filled his gaze.

He was Bo Wen Lin—Bo Yong Feng’s father—and had the cultivation of the seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier. After being informed that his son was killed by someone, he immediately came out chasing.

“Killed my son, and still want to walk away from it?” he said, clenching his teeth.

“So what do you want?” Ling Han said indifferently.

Out to kill, Bo Wen Lin’s said fiercely, “A life for a life!”

Ling Han shook his head and said, “If you attack, then it’ll be the death of father and son! I’ll give you a chance: leave now. If you attack me, then you’ll be seeking your own death.”

He turned and continued to walk towards the mineshaft.

Being glanced at by Ling Han, Bo Wen Lin instantly felt a terrible chill well up inside his heart, not daring to attack. He clenched his fists and watched Ling Han go into the distance, involuntarily revealing a grim smile.

Everyone knew that entering the mine meant certain death. Well, although he couldn’t personally take revenge, the most important thing was the result.

He stared at Ling Han to confirm that Ling Han entered the mine and didn’t just pretend to do so, taking the chance to slip away.
