3030 Cursing

They wanted to take him as their master?

The large black dog was instantly amused. He cleared his throat, and said, “You all want to acknowledge me as your master?”

It deliberately pretended to be serious, and the aura of Heavenly Venerable Tier overflowed, reaching up to the sky and descending to the underworld. It was extremely shocking.

As expected, when the Celestial Kings outside sensed this powerful aura, they immediately confirmed that the large black dog was extraordinary. Although they couldn’t see the “person,” they all knelt down. “Please show kindness, Master!”

The large black dog chuckled. “One can’t impart his techniques easily. Why should I impart them to you?”

The people outside looked at each other. Oh, the “master” didn’t reject them outright.

There was a chance.

After they knelt down, they didn’t get up again. All of them knelt down respectfully to show their sincerity.

The large black dog naturally wouldn’t stop them. This kind of trickster naturally took pleasure in toying with people.

“However, these people are really courageous. They clearly know that we’ve taken down the signboard of Shatter Mountains, yet they still dare to come here and ask to become disciples?” The large black dog was in disbelief.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s precisely because we destroyed Shatter Mountains’ signboard that they dared to come over.”

“You’re saying that they think we can stand against Shatter Mountains?” The large black dog was astounded. Who didn’t know that Seventh Tiers were invincible? Even if Ling Han was also a Seventh Tier, who would dare to be sandwiched in between two Seventh Tiers as cannon fodder?

Taking the risk of offending a Seventh Tier to cozy up to another Seventh Tier was extremely unwise.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “They probably don’t know the true background of the Shatter Mountains’ place of enlightenment.”

The large black dog was stunned for a moment before it came to a realization.

Not all Celestial Kings had the qualifications to know about Seventh Tier ultimate elites. For example, even after Ling Han had advanced into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, he initially hadn’t known how many Seventh Tiers there were in the world, and who they were.

In that case, how could the other Celestial Kings know?

They should only know that the place of enlightenment of Shatter Mountains was extremely extraordinary, and that there was a Heavenly Venerate overseeing it, yet Ling Han and the others dared to cause trouble. What did this mean?

At the very least, Ling Han and the others were no weaker than this Heavenly Venerate from Shatter Mountains’ place of enlightenment.

Thus, they all came over to cozy up to someone powerful. If they could be accepted as disciples by a Heavenly Venerate, they might have a chance to take that most crucial step into the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Ling Han ignored them. Since these people liked to kneel, he would just let them kneel more.

One day passed, two days, three days. The old ginseng and the others had already sobered up, but all of them had a headache. Before reaching Heavenly Venerable Tier, they would be bound by Regulations, so it wasn’t strange for them to get drunk.

When they saw the Celestial Kings kneeling outside the inn, they were all shocked. What was going on?

With every passing day, more and more Celestial Kings would arrive. They were all people who had come to ask to become disciples. After learning of the situation, they also knelt down indiscriminately, begging either Ling Han or any other Heavenly Venerate to take them as disciples.

Celestial Kings wouldn’t feel any discomfort even if they knelt for an epoch, let alone a few days.

Thus, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to give up in a short period of time. How lucky was it to be able to become a disciple of a Heavenly Venerate?

Furthermore, this was only kneeling. It wasn’t like they were venturing into an ancient site. There was no danger to their lives.

More than 10 days later, more and more Celestial Kings had come, and there were even some Ascending Origin Tiers and Immortal Palace Tiers who had come to try their luck. Who knew, perhaps Ling Han would take a fancy to them?

Since he had nothing to do, Ling Han used his divine sense to scan these people. With his strength, there was no need for him to show himself at all. He could do it from afar.

He wanted to see if he could find any light spots in their minds.

Obviously, this was impossible.

There should be pitifully few people who possessed light spots. Otherwise, the secret code of life would be too worthless. Ling Han was truly extremely lucky to have met Ning Haixin and unlocked the basics of the eighth type of power.

After a few more days, what was supposed to happen finally came.

“Audacious maniac, why aren’t you begging for mercy?!” A voice sounded, as if it had drifted over from afar.

Immediately, a few Celestial Kings who were kneeling around the inn jumped up, and shouted, “How dare you! You actually dare to be disrespectful to Master! Quickly come out and accept your death!”

“Hehe, is that so?” A moment ago, it had been incomparably far away, but in the blink of an eye, a short old man had appeared on the street. He had his hands crossed behind his back, and his back was slightly arched. He looked ordinary.

He looked at the Celestial Kings standing there, and with a wave of his right hand, he said, “Mere Celestial Kings actually dare to be impudent in front of me!”

It looked like he was just waving his hand. Pa, pa, pa, pa! Those Celestial Kings were immediately torn into pieces, turning into bloody bits, and blood instantly flowed all over the ground.

Clang! The heaven and earth trembled, and blood rained down. Endless grief filled the air, lamenting the loss of all the Celestial Kings.

‘This!’

The other Celestial Kings were all shocked. This was too terrifying. With just a wave of his hand, seven Celestial Kings died without any resistance, and there was even an Eighth Heaven Celestial King among them.

This was… a Heavenly Venerate!

These Celestial Kings were all aghast, and some of them were even trembling.

They had come to ask to become the disciple of a Heavenly Venerate, but they didn’t have the slightest intention of going against another Heavenly Venerate.

How could such weak people like them be able to resist the might of a Heavenly Venerate?

“All of you, get up!” the short elder said as he swept his gaze over them, his eyes extremely cold.

All the Celestial Kings didn’t dare to disobey. There had to be 10 peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to match a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and only 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates could match a First Tier.

In that case, even if this elder was only in the First Tier, at least 100 peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were needed to stand against him.

There were indeed quite a few Celestial Kings here, but how many of them had reached the peak of Ninth Heaven?

If this Heavenly Venerate wanted to, he could instantly slaughter them all.

“Throw curses at them!” the short old man said calmly.

Because of his own self-importance, it was naturally impossible for him to start a war of curses. However, Ling Han and the others had clearly seen him arrive, yet not only did they not come out, they did not even speak, which made him extremely angry.

‘Aren’t you guys too disrespectful?’

No matter what, he was still a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

All the Celestial Kings looked at each other. They didn’t dare to offend this short old man, but did they dare to offend Ling Han and the others?

Both sides were Heavenly Venerates!

They were really regretting it now. If they had known that the matter with the Shatter Mountains place of enlightenment had not been resolved, why would they have rushed over?

Could it be that this was Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Mm-hm, you can’t open your mouth?” The short old man swept his gaze over them with an extremely fierce gaze. “Alright, I’ll help you!”

He swept his palm over, and a Celestial King immediately exploded into a bloody mist.

With this ferocious might, how could the others hesitate? Nothing was more important than protecting their own lives.

“Hey, those people inside, listen up, the lord wants you to come out!”

“Come out quickly. Don’t let this lord wait!”

These Celestial Kings called out, but they didn’t dare to say anything foul. Otherwise, if they really offended Ling Han and the others, they would still die.

However, no matter how they shouted, no one walked out of the inn. It seemed like they were afraid, but at the same time, they seemed to be disdainful of them.

The short elder finally revealed a look of impatience. He was a dignified Heavenly Venerate, so how could he have the time to waste here?

He was ready to make his move.
