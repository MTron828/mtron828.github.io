Chapter 3396: Surrender

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Bai was baffled. The development of the situation was too sudden, catching him off guard.

Why did the Demon Race surrender?

He found it strange, but could it be that the dignified Dark North Nation didn’t even dare to accept a letter of surrender? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yang Bai walked out and faced Xue Chiluo.

Xue Chiluo stretched out his hand and an edict appeared out of thin air. He held it with both hands and handed it over to Yang Bai.

Yang Bai took the edict and opened it.

The Four Great Generals and the princes could not help but lean over. After sweeping their gazes over, they all revealed surprised and delighted expressions.

This was really a letter of surrender.

According to the letter, the Emperor of the Demon Race held Chen Fengyan in high esteem, so he was willing to lead the country to surrender and submit to Chen Fengyan from now on.

“Long live His Majesty!” Yang Bai was the first to speak. His voice was loud and trembling.

From the surrender letter, it could be seen that the reason why the Demon Race surrendered was entirely because of Chen Fengyan.

A person could conquer a country; this was practically the stuff of legends. “Long live the Holy Emperor!” The Four Great Generals also raised their weapons and shouted.

“Long live the Holy Emperor!” Although the people around did not see the letter of surrender with their own eyes, the Council Chairman and the Four Great Generals were already in such a state. How could it be fake? Naturally, they also roared.

Who would have thought that an imminent war would end in such a dramatic manner?

“in order to express my emperor’s respect and establish the eternal friendship between the two races, my emperor has also sent out his most beloved daughter, Princess Bixiao. He hopes to marry her to a prince as a bridge of friendship between the two empires,” Xue Chiluo said again. He stepped back slightly and bowed, giving way to a woman behind him.

This woman had been hiding behind Xue Chiluo, and her face was covered by a white veil. Her face could not be seen, so she naturally did not attract anyone’s attention.

It was only now that she was exposed under the gaze of tens of millions of

eyes.

She was a peerless beauty.

All of a sudden, everyone had the same thought.

Although this woman’s appearance was not revealed, just her figure alone was enough to make one’s heart flutter. She was definitely a peerless beauty that could bring disaster to a country.

The princess of the Demon Race was here as an offer in a matrimonial alliance. Everyone couldn’t help but cast their gazes on those princes. To betroth such a peerless beauty to one of them, just thinking about it made them jealous. Princess Bixiao took off her veil, revealing a face that would be beautiful in both joy and anger. Her facial features were as exquisite as the most exquisite work of art in the world, dreamy and illusory.

Could such a peerless beauty really exist in the human world?

She bowed to the princes and the Four Great Generals and said, “Bixiao greets

the princes and Lords.”

This woman was so beautiful that she could topple cities. Not only did the Four Great Generals and Yang Bai reveal dumbfounded expressions, but even the elder princes were also moved.

Everyone looked at the princes with even more envy, jealousy, and hatred. They were willing to kill and commit arson for the sake of such a beautiful woman.

Ling Han bared his teeth. Could it be that this Emperor of the Demon Race wanted to use a honey trap to sow discord, using Princess Bixiao to cause chaos in the Dark North Nation, and win the war without fighting?

“Father, I’ll definitely look better than her when I grow up.” Sixth Baby pouted.

Ling Han chuckled, but didn’t say anything.

Sixtn, you’re invisible. So what if you’re beautiful? No one can see you! Sigh, without the large black dog by his side, there was no one to help him complain. He had to be responsible to complain about all the fault points. It was very tiring.

This Princess Bixiao was indeed very beautiful, but she couldn’t compare to the empress and Hu Niu. Ling Han quickly retracted his attention, and asked Sixth Baby, “How powerful is the Azure Star Physique?”

Sixth Baby bit her finger and thought for a moment before saying, “It can activate a Mystical Power and release a green aura that has terrifying

destructive power.”

If even Sixth Baby could say so, then this green energy should be very powerful.

“However, the Azure Star Physique can only be ranked ninth. It can’t compare to many Mystical Powers that are acquired.” Sixth Baby expressed disdain again.

“For example, your invisibility technique?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “That’s right. The divine powers that the seven of us possess can definitely be ranked in the top three. Only the Immeasurable Divine Physique, the Myriad Tribulations Divine Physique, and some other super Divine Physiques can surpass us. However, such a Divine Physique might not even appear in tens of thousands of years,” Sixth Baby said very proudly.

Eh, why are you infected with Third Baby’s illness?

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel envious. He was clearly born from the Divine Stone, so why didn’t he have any Mystical Power?

This didn’t make sense.

Could it be that he had some hidden Mystical Power that he had yet to activate?

Ling Han could not help but start complaining again.

“Looks like there’s nothing more for us to do. Let’s go back.” Ling Han turned around. Since the Demon Race had already surrendered, there naturally wouldn’t be a war.

Without the threat of the Demon Race, naturally, no one dared to place Ling Han under house arrest. The Imperial Guards outside his courtyard quickly withdrew.

Two days later, Xuanyuan Dingguo came to see him.

“Hey, hey, hey, do you know why the Demon Race surrendered?” This guy said mysteriously.

“I don’t know.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Take a guess!” Xuanyuan Dingguo kept him in suspense.

“Forget it if you don’t want to say it.” Ling Han turned his head away.

Eh, why aren’t you curious at all?

Xuanyuan Dingguo sighed. “You’re not fun at all.”

However, he could not hold back at all. He immediately came over and said,

“It’s His Majesty!”

“En?” Ling Han looked towards him.

“Four days ago, His Majesty personally went to the Demon Race’s Imperial Palace and fought with the demon emperor. The next day, the demon emperor made the decision to submit and sent Xue Chiluo and Princess Bixiao out,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said.

His face was full of admiration. “If only I could attain 1% of His Majesty’s strength in this life.”

Ling Han was also surprised. It turned out that Chen Fengyan had actually come out of seclusion without making a sound, and had even “educated” the Demon Emperor, directly beating the Demon Race into submission.

This was a complete mess.

Why didn’t Chen Fengyan reveal this in advance? Evidently, this Holy Emperor wanted to see everyone’s performance. With this, the peace-seeking faction’s true colors would be revealed, and they would definitely not be placed in an important position by Chen Fengyan in the future.

“Speaking of which, that princess of the Demon Race is too beautiful. She’s simply a bringer of disaster!” Xuanyuan Dingguo changed the topic and talked about Princess Bixiao.

“What a pity. The Demon Race has already made it clear this princess will be betrothed to one of the princes. We have no share.” He sighed, as if his parents had died.

Bixiao’s charm was evident.

Ling Han shook his head, and said with a smile, “Then cultivate diligently. In the future, you’ll be even more impressive than the Demon Emperor. Wouldn t it be fine then if you married another of his daughters?”

Xuanyuan Dingguo acted as if he was about to him. Surpass the demon emperor? That was impossible!

Peng, peng, peng! At this moment, someone knocked on the door.

Who was it? It was so late.

The little maid ran to open the door. After a while, she ran back in shock and said, “Young Master, Young Master, there’s a person outside who calls himself the Princess of the Demon Race and wants to see you.

Xuanyuan Dingguo spat out a mouthful of tea..
