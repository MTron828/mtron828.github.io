“Brat, didn’t you hear us tell you to get lost?” The four men humphed coldly.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You’re quite pompous for people with weak abilities.”

“What!?” One man walked forward. “Do you have any idea who my young master is?”

“Oh, who is it?” Ling Han asked, smiling. He really couldn’t care less.

“Zhang Tong, Young Master Tong!” this man declared proudly as if he himself was that Zhang Tong.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and continued, “So going by that logic, you are the lapdog of a lapdog, the so-called second dog?”

“You, you, you...” The man pointed furiously at Ling Han. “Are you tired of living?”

“Oh, so this is how the Majestic Heaven Sect treats guests?” Ling Han asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Wrong, we are not the disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and thus have no need to be restricted by the rules of the sect,” this man said sinisterly. Then, he snapped his fingers. “Brothers, let us give this guy a profound lesson.”

“Hehehe!” The other three men stepped out, each staring at Ling Han like they were hungry wolves that had caught sight of a little rabbit.

After Ling Han had formed his fifth Mountain River Tier, his aura became reserved. His whole person became as profoundly deep as the ocean, and it was very difficult to distinguish exactly how strong he was. Furthermore, it had already been a month ago since he had broken through to the pinnacle of Mountain River Tier. Presently, his power had advanced to seven stars!

Seven stars of power above the peak of Mountain River Tier... what kind of notion was that?

He took a look at Zhang Tong, and asked, “These dogs of yours are barking madly, and you are not planning to take them to heel?”

“Beat all the teeth out of his mouth!” Zhang Tong commanded icily, his expression changing.

At first, he had not cared about Ling Han. So what if they had beaten this kind of minor character? He could not even bother to give him a second look. So what if he was arrogant? As a follower of Lord Yang Hao, why couldn’t he be arrogant? It had to be known that Venerable Trinity had the intention to take Yang Hao as a personal disciple!

If Yang Hao actually became the personal disciple of an elite of the Eternal River Tier, so what if he decided to do as he liked in the Majestic Heaven Sect?

“Hehehehe!” The four lapdogs all laughed coldly. Zhang Tong himself was an overbearing person, and they were used to acting arrogant by his side. They had absolutely no idea what the word ‘reserved’ meant.

Those around them quickly stepped back, fearing that they would be dragged in.

That was Zhang Tong; who would dare to bother with other people’s business like this? Furthermore, they were not disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect, so what basis did they have to interfere in this matter?

“Humph, what intolerable bullies!” Just at this moment, a woman in green leaped out of the crowd. “You are all merely a bunch of lackeys, and you still dare to be so arrogant!”

Zhang Tong took one look at her, and couldn’t help but look stunned.

She was actually an exquisite beauty. Her hair fell like waterfall, and she had a complexion fairer than snow. Her features were incredibly delicate, especially those large eyes. It was as if they could speak, and were filled with the mischief of a young girl.

His heart throbbed involuntarily, and he asked, “Miss, how may I address you?”

“What do you care who I am? I cannot bear to see bullies who like to bully others as they like!” the beauty in green declared with her head held high like a proud swan.

“Junior Sister!” Another man forced his way out. His figure was tall, and he was amazingly sturdy. However, he did not appear overbearing. Instead, he gave off a cowering vibe. On one side, he bowed repeatedly towards Zhang Tong and his four lackeys as he said, “Apologies, apologies. This is my junior sister disciple. She is rash in her speech and actions, so please do not fault her. Please bear with her.”

As everyone watched this, they all shook their heads secretly.

The personalities of these two fellow disciples were really two extremes of the spectrum. One disdained evil like it was her personal enemy, while the other was cowardly and timid.

Yet Zhang Tong smirked coldly. “With just an apology and asking me to bear with her, you think you can stay out of this matter?”

“That... Young Master Zhang, what do you want to do?” the sturdy man asked.

“Since you have offended me, you naturally have to make amends and apologize! Why don’t we go have a drink and chat at the Heavenly Distant Restaurant later?” Zhang Tong’s eyes were fixed on the beauty in green, his heart itching.

The masses naturally understood in a flash. As men, how could they not read between the lines? Zhang Tong wanted to have that woman.

“This...” The sturdy man was hesitant.

“Senior Brother, he is only a lackey. Why do we have to be afraid of him?” the beauty in green asked, fuming.

“Junior Sister, how many times have I told you? Don’t cause trouble, don’t cause trouble! Sigh!” The sturdy man sighed, but just as the masses thought that he was about to compromise, he suddenly boldly went into an attack posture, and declared, “No one can humiliate my Junior Sister!”

At this instant, he really had an awe-inspiring presence, without the slightest bit of cowardice from before.

Zhang Tong couldn’t help but laugh loudly, and said, “So it turns out you’re an idiot! Apprehend him!” He stretched out a finger to point at the large man. He was sure that as long as this person was apprehended, this beauty in green would definitely be his to order around as he desired.

Now that the four lackeys had received their command, they would naturally not have the time to deal with Ling Han. Instead, they pounced at the sturdy man like wolves.

Previously, the tall man had looked like he was afraid of trouble, but when it really came to a point when there was no retreat, he revealed his fierce side. With a shake of his fists, he slammed them together. Suddenly, a terrifying wave of power was created.

His fists swelled. Previously, they had only been the size of clay basins. Though they were still big, it was still within normal range, but now, they were at least three times bigger than the head. They had also turned an ash color, flickering with a metallic light.

Weng , his arms also waved, like they were waves of water. The ripples continued from the wrist to his shoulder, and after every ripple, there would be another divine pattern added to his fists, and they became even stronger than before.

Yi , what kind of martial arts technique was this? It was quite interesting.

Ling Han watched from the sidelines. He was in no rush to interfere.

Xiu , the four lackeys had already pounced over, and they each made their move.

Peng, peng, peng, peng . The sturdy man delivered a punch at an incredibly fast pace. He actually managed to unleash four punches in a single instant, and exchanged a blow with each of the four lackeys. He seemed to have become a spring, and was filled with elasticity. Thus, after he had shot out a punch, he made use of the rebound to quickly deliver the second punch.

Ling Han watched closely. With every punch, one of the divine patterns on the tall man’s fists would disappear, and his battle prowess would decline slightly.

Interesting, the power of his punches would be weakened with the increasing number of times he delivered punches. However, he only had to pause for a while, and the power of his punches would again become stronger. His battle prowess fluctuated indefinitely.

The sturdy man’s cultivation level was in the late stage of the low extreme of Mountain River Tier. Out of those four lackeys, three were on the same level as he, and the last was even stronger as he had reached the peak stage of the low extreme. Hence, the first punch from the large man was finally aimed at that person in the peak of the low extreme; this was his strongest blow.

After a while, not only those watching from the sidelines could see everything clearly, but realization also dawned on even those four henchmen.

“Speed up the attack, don’t allow him to have a chance to recover the power in his punch!”

The attacks of the four came faster and faster, causing the sturdy man to deliver punches as much as they could. In this manner, even if the divine patterns on his fists would recover automatically, the rate of recovery would be far from catching up to the rate in which they were expended, so his attack power would naturally decline.

“I will not allow you to bully my senior brother!” The beauty in green drew her sword, anger filling her expression.
