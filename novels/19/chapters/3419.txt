Chapter 3420: Wooden Bridge

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han brought the seven toddlers through one palace after another. By the seventeenth one they entered, he finally discovered that there were more people inside.

Some people fought fiercely because they discovered Treasured Fruits or peculiar herbs, while others argued and could not convince the other party, leading to a completely unnecessary battle. This was actually very common among cultivators. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A great many young people thought that the heavens were the boss of the world, and they themselves were the second. They were young and rash, and did not like to reason. Everything could be resolved with their fists.

In the competition in ancient sites, there was no suppression by the law, and the slightest move could cause a great conflict.

Ling Han looked around. There wasn’t any Treasured Fruit or Myterious Herb here that was worth his time, so he naturally couldn’t be bothered to come over. He continued to head deeper into the palace. On the way, he continued to improve his use of Heavenly Pattern Jade.

This group of palace halls was astonishingly huge. After passing through the thirty-third level of the palace hall, what they saw when they exited the doors was not a garden, but rather an arched bridge, as if it was erected in the skies. Clouds and mist swirled underneath, and the scenery below could not be seen at all.

This arched bridge was actually made of wood. Though it looked fine, this place had existed for who knew how many years. Had the wood rotted or not?

Ling Han felt slightly anxious. He activated his ocular technique, and upon a closer look, discovered that this wooden bridge was really maintained very well. As far as he could see, there was not the slightest sign of damage.

“Father, this is Swordwood. Even if it is immersed in water, it would not decompose even in 10,000 years… even sturdier than a great many pieces of fine iron are ,” Eldest Baby said, beginning to impart knowledge to Ling Han again.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. Why did he feel like these seven children were the adults, while he himself was an infant that knew nothing?

“Let’s go, let’s go.” The seven babies were the first to jump onto the bridge, and ran forwards happily.

Ling Han also stepped onto the bridge. Indeed, though this bridge was made of wood, it was very sturdy. Even if there was a mountain breeze blowing, the wooden bridge did not have the slightest ripple.

However, this wooden bridge was really long. Though Ling Han did not walk very fast, he still had not walked to the end after ten minutes.

‘Hmm?’

Fear suddenly gripped at his heart. He looked down, only to see clouds and mist billowing beneath him. It was as if something terrifying were about to appear. He activated his eye technique and looked over, yet the clouds and mist blocked his vision, preventing him from seeing through it.

Second Baby also leaned over the railing to look, but very soon, she withdrew her gaze, and shook her head at Ling Han.

Obviously, her eyesight was also unable to see through the fog. This was condensed from high-level energy.

Ling Han felt as if he were facing a great enemy. If there really was some terrifying creature charging up from below, he would immediately wrap up the seven toddlers and store them into the gourd. As for the fat pig, well, he would throw it out to block for a while.

The fat pig seemed to have sensed his thoughts, and spat at him.

Thankfully, after the clouds and mist roiled for a while, peace returned.

Ling Han hurriedly quickened his steps. There was no sky or ground here. He felt too insecure.

After crossing the bridge, they saw that this was actually a cliff. Ahead of them, there were multiple palaces erected on the steep cliffs.

Yi, wasn’t this at the bottom of a lake? Why was there a cliff here?

Judging by the situation, it seemed like an entire mountain had been crushed into the ground. Thus, a lake had formed here, but due to the drastic change of heaven and earth, the lake waters dried up, and this place reappeared.

Ling Han walked towards the nearest palace. The main doors were still wide open. After he entered, he discovered that there was an intense battle going on inside. It was a one-on-eight battle, and the battle was extremely intense.

The one being ganged up on was a young man. His attire was very ordinary, and he looked like a very rustic mountain man at a glance, but his abilities were really extraordinary, reaching the height of Five Inscriptions.

His eight opponents were much weaker. The majority were Extreme Bone Tier elites, and only one of them had reached the level of Inscription Tier. Moreover, he was only a One Inscription.

Ordinarily, the Five Inscriptions should have had an absolute advantage, and would be able to instantly kill these eight people easily, but that was not the truth. They were fighting an incredibly long and drawn out battle.

This was because the movements of the Five Inscriptions elite were very jerky. He was like a rookie that had made too many mistakes that he should not have made in his first fight. If it was not for the fact that he had the absolute advantage in strength, he would have long since been beaten to the ground a considerable number of times.

However, it was also because of this that he had a lot of room for growth. Every time he battled for a while longer, his strength would increase slightly, and he would become more and more powerful. Gradually, he would be able to suppress those eight people.

“Stop! Stop!” the One Inscription elite shouted, and the eight of them instantly retreated.

The Five Inscriptions elite didn’t give chase. Instead, he looked at Ling Han and shouted, “Are you also here to fight for the treasure?”

Ling Han spread out his hands, and asked, “What treasure is it? Can you introduce it to me?”

The Five Inscriptions elite looked at Ling Han, humphed, and said, “Since you dare covet my treasure, I’ll kill you!”

Xiu! He leaped over and threw a punch at Ling Han.

It was not a martial arts technique, just a very simple punch, just like this was a fight between ordinary people.

Ling Han was astonished. ‘Are you really a Five Inscriptions elite? You’ve already cultivated to such a high level, so how come you don’t even know martial arts techniques?’

Was he deliberately trying to lull him into a false sense of security?

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The Five Inscriptions elite threw a few punches in quick succession, but Ling Han really couldn’t see anything special about it.

He suddenly gave a ‘ya’, as if he had understood.

Combined with the other’s incomparably poor battle prowess, as well as the rustic air around him, Ling Han was sure that this person was the lucky person who had ingested the Strengthening Origin Fruit previously. He had directly risen from an ordinary person to the level of Inscription Tier, and was at the height of Five Inscriptions. If he could eat a few more, he would probably become an Enlightenment Tier elite.

If one really reached the Enlightenment Tier, they wouldn’t need any martial arts or techniques. They would be able to suppress Inscription Tiers with speed and power alone.

“You were just an ordinary person in the mountains before, weren’t you?” Ling Han asked calmly. “When this palace opened, you were nearby just then, so you were the first to enter. As a result, you ate a great many Strengthening Origin Fruits, soaring to the level of Inscription Tier in an instant.”

The Five Inscriptions elite couldn’t help but feel his expression change drastically. Ling Han had guessed correctly.

Indeed, he had only been a farmer in the past. When the underground palace appeared, he had been harvesting herbs nearby. He had been brave enough to enter, and in the end, he had discovered the Strengthening Origin Fruit.

At first, he didn’t dare to eat it, fearing that it would be poisonous. However, he had also heard all kinds of related stories, and later, he couldn’t help but eat one. As a result, his level of being rose greatly.

Thus, he ate one after another, pushing his cultivation level to the level of Five Inscriptions.

It should be known that he had only been an ordinary farmer before. He was too ordinary, and had completely no idea how strong he was now. When he saw the cultivators that entered later, he would usually hide.

However, there would eventually come a time when he could not dodge, and battles ensued. Yet he discovered that those cultivators that he initially thought were unattainable in his eyes could not even withstand a single blow from him.

After several battles, his confidence was already incredibly inflated, and he thought that he had already become a supreme elite.

Thus, he no longer hid his tracks, and openly began to search and contend for

treasures..
