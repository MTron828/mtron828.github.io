2806 Troubles lie ahead

Ling Han did not want to leave.

In circumstances where both sides had about the same strength, there had never been any previous cases when he had avoided the battle. That was too embarrassing.

But Zhang Kailun’s challenges were really too annoying, and Ling Han had to seriously consider this issue.

He swore that he would definitely give this guy a good beating when he advanced to the Second Tier.

In the Flaming Frost Realm, on a certain mountain.

Zhuang Feirui stood at the summit, arms crossed behind his back. He was clearly not moving, but waves of power were surging from the heaven and earth into his body. This was not Spiritual Qi, but rather the fundamental power of the Genesis World.

When one had reached his heights, even if he was not deliberately cultivating, his body would still instinctively channel and be constantly in a state of cultivation, increasing his cultivation level.

He was like a god standing there, and others would only want to worship him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Milord!” A Ninth Heaven Celestial King arrived at the summit. “Zhang Kailun has already issued challenges to Ling Han for over 30,000 years.”

Zhuang Feirui nodded, his gaze cast into the distance. He murmured, “If Ling Han still had had any trump card, he would have already used it on Zhuang Feirui, but he has not used it all this while. Does that mean he has already used up his trump cards?”

That Ninth Heaven Celestial King stood respectfully, his arms laid beside his thighs. He was like an apprentice, and there was completely no sign of the domineering air that belonged to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

He did not dare reply to these words.

Zhuang Feirui released a long sigh. He condensed boundless Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, which formed the shape of a dragon that circled around him. Then, it actually soared off.

This was a True Dragon, at the Celestial King Tier.

Just an exhaled breath could create a True Dragon; his power was truly unimaginable.

“Looks like I need to take a trip,” Zhuang Feirui said evenly, killing intent flickering in his eyes.

When it came to Ling Han, he felt too much hatred.

In the Spiritual Treasure Sea.

“Grandfather, that Zhang Kailun has already stayed at Ling City for over 30,000 years. Looks like Ling Han really doesn’t have any more trump cards.” Upon the back of a giant turtle that was tens of thousands of meters wide, there were two people standing, and they both looked extremely young.

The one who had spoken was a young man dressed in purple robes. He looked cultured and refined, but the aura exuding from him was extremely shocking. He was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

The other man was dressed in black robes, and looked to be about the same age as the man in purple, but his eyes were exuding a sense of vicissitudes, incredibly profound, and ancient.

This was a grandfather-grandson pair. The grandfather’s title was Saintly Origin, and he was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, while his grandson was Jiang Feiguang, who had just recently advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Thus, he had not obtained a title yet.

The Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin nodded. “This boy possesses a Heavenly Venerable Seal, one that is not one of those more widely known seven seals. It is extraordinarily valuable. There must be a great number of people who will be eyeing him. I want to move personally. This treasure… I am determined to get hold of it!”

Jiang Feiguang showed a hint of envy. He, too, wanted that Heavenly Venerable Seal that was not one of the more widely known seven seals, but how could he possibly dare to contend with his own grandfather? He could only salivate.

“Let’s go back,” the Heavenly Venerate Saintly Origin said lightly, and the giant turtle beneath them immediately turned around. With a sweep of its four limbs, tens of thousands of kilometers were left behind them.

“Sealed Emotion!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate appeared within a valley. It was completely covered with ice and snow, and even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be instantly turned into an ice statue upon entering because this was not a natural coldness, but rather originated from a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Sealed Emotion sat in a cross-legged position. Snow and ice was whirling in the radius of nine meters from him, turning into one seal after another, but every single one of them was extremely blurred, and could not be distinguished.

When Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate saw this, his eyes narrowed involuntarily.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was creating his own Heavenly Venerable Seal. Though it was unknown how far he still had to go before succeeding, the fact that he could reach this step meant he had already surpassed 99% of other Heavenly Venerates.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate couldn’t help but feel jealous. Though he had also advanced to the Third Tier, he did not even have to think of forming a Heavenly Venerable Seal by himself.

Not only did mastering different Heavenly Venerable Seals affect battle prowess, it would also create a massive difference in the rate of cultivation. It was possible for this difference to be 10 times, 20 times, or even more.

With this in mind, his heart burned even hotter.

“How about we go and find that brat, Ling Han, and snatch that Heavenly Venerable Seal?” he asked.

Sealed Emotion sat quietly, and after a while, the seals around him suddenly vanished. HIs eyes abruptly snapped open. “It is said that that brat possesses the battle prowess of the Third Tier. Even if we make a move, we may not be able to succeed.”

“Let’s work together. We will have at least a 50% chance of success,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate said. “Furthermore, if we don’t kill this boy quickly, will we still be a match for him when he advances to the Second Tier or Third Tier?

“Don’t forget about how we treated him in the Celestial Realm!”

Sealed Emotion couldn’t help but sigh. Previously, Imperial Void had already begged him to interfere, but when Sealed Emotion found out that Ling Han was already a cripple, he did not make a move. However, from the look of things now, it was clear that he had fallen for Ling Han’s evil deceptions.

…He had never been crippled, but only used this method so that a great many elites would disdain from making a move on him. And what was the end result? He had successfully advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, becoming capable of matching a Third Tier when he himself was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“That despicable brat… has to die!” Sealed Emotion declared menacingly. To speak of nothing else, his most outstanding disciple had died by Ling Han’s hand. How could he not get vengeance?

“Then, does Friend Sealed Emotion agree to cooperate with me?” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was pleased.

Yet Sealed Emotion shook his head. “There is no chance of victory if we make our move now. I have to go into seclusion and cultivate, and when I have successfully completed my cultivation, I naturally will seek out that brat.”

He had outstanding natural talent, and was already not far off from forming his own Heavenly Venerable Seal. There was naturally no way he would give up at this point in time.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate tried to persuade him further, but the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable asked him to leave, so the former could only leave helplessly.

He arrived at the entrance of the valley, raised his head, and looked at the skies. Among the four great Heavenly Venerates that had initially come here, it was he who had the most inferior achievements. Wu Le was advancing the quickest, and it was rumored that he was close to advancing to the Fourth Tier, while Green Flames was not that far behind him.

Initially, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was about Jiuwu’s equal, but now he was actually close to successfully cultivating a Heavenly Venerable Seal. It was very possible that he would now catch up and surpass him.

The disparity in his heart was extremely large. As a Heavenly Venerate, how could he be willing to bow to fate?

“No, I must get hold of that Heavenly Venerable Seal!” the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate declared through clenched teeth.

Ling Han could clearly feel that the ambience in Ling City recently was becoming tense. Though Zhang Kailun had constantly challenged him, multiple streaks of divine sense would sweep towards them, and lock onto Ling Han every time the two of them battled.

Ling Han sighed. Zhang Kailun was truly a bringer of misfortune. Originally, when he had killed He Liqun with the letter that Chu Hao had bestowed on him, this had intimidated the majority of ambitious characters, but with the fuss caused by Zhang Kailun, the strength of this intimidation had sunk to rock bottom.

There should already be a lot of people who guessed that Ling Han actually no longer had any trump cards, but no one wanted to pave the way for others. Thus, not one of them had leaped out, and they were still observing.

...

But this kind of situation would not last too long. Not long after, the first person would jump out, and then the second, and the third, all wanting to devour him completely.

The temptation of a Heavenly Venerable Seal was something that even a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate would find hard to resist.

‘It’s time to leave.’

Ling Han had planned to in the first place; he had only been hesitating. However, the present situation helped him strengthen his resolve.

Originally, he had wanted to take his daughter along, but Ling Xi could burst out with battle prowess at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and no one knew who she was in the martial academy. If he went there rashly, it would instead expose her identity.

Forget it; it would be just them leaving, in that case.
