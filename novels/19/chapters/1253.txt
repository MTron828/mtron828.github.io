Chapter 1254: Tempered by Divine flame

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was confident, but definitely not arrogant.

After breaking out of the siege, Ling Han stopped, and waited for the old ginseng and Rabbit to come over.

When they arrived, Ling Han asked, “Rabbit, do you want to go to a good place?”

“What good place?” Rabbit asked. He had not entered into the Black Tower yet.

Ling Han laughed, and threw the old ginseng into the Black Tower first. Then, he grabbed Rabbit, and the both of them entered together.

“This, what kind of place is this!?” Rabbit could not be any more stunned. A Spatial God Tool was something that he didn’t dare to even think about.

“There, go and cultivate there!” Ling Han threw him underneath the Reincarnation Tree, and did not bother to explain. He’d just let the old ginseng and him torment themselves.

After a short while, he heard Rabbit making a big fuss. He had really been stunned. If he comprehended Dao underneath this Divine Tree, then wouldn’t there be a chance for him to reach the Genesis Tier?

Ling Han chuckled, and summoned Small Tower over. He asked, “Is there a way to quickly erase the alchemic poison in my body?”

Small Tower sank slightly, and said, “Yes!”

Ling Han was immediately elated, and quickly asked, “Quickly, tell me what do I do?”

If he could really speed up the dispersal of the alchemic poison in his body, he could reach consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier in a very short period of time. Then, he could advance into the pinnacle level, and then charge up to the peak of the pinnacle level.

“The fourth floor of the Black Tower is already unlocked. It can provide divine flame once every three months to temper your body. Underneath the divine flame, everything inside your body would be completely burnt,” Small Tower said calmly.

A muscle involuntarily twitched in Ling Han’s cheek. Why did that sound so terrifying?

However, the Black Tower could provide a divine flame to temper his physique. This was something that Small Tower had said long ago. It was just that Small Tower had not spoken of this again, and he was close to forgetting completely about it.

He probed, “Then would I be in danger?”

“Yes!” Small Tower nodded. “If you cannot survive, you will be turned into ash— no, you wouldn’t be able to leave even ashes behind, but rather would be burnt completely into nothing. And I would no longer have to bear with an idiotic Master like you.”

‘F*ck, you tsundere Tower, will you die if you don’t mock me!?’

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then asked, “Why didn’t you tell me before?”

“You want to die so badly?” Small Tower countered first with a question, and then said, “At first, I wanted to wait until you had reached the Heavenly Body Tier before allowing you to temper your heavenly body, and boost up your physique to another level.”

Actually, Small Tower was a softie at heart. It had already planned out the future for Ling Han. It should be the direction that was most beneficial for Ling Han’s development. It only liked to mock Ling Han all the time.

Ling Han was pleasantly surprised, and asked, “You mean that I can further improve my physique, and reach the extent of surpassing two minor levels?”

“Surpassing two minor levels is a little exaggerated, but you would definitely be much stronger than now. Furthermore, if you were refined by divine flame, the biggest effect would be to allow you to gain the possibility of rising from the ashes,” Small Tower said.

Ling Han immediately looked determined, and said, “There is no need to consider it. I want to be tempered by the divine flame!”

In the small world, his physique surpassed his cultivation level by a major tier. He was practically a monster among his peers, and it was impossible that anyone would be able to wound him. Even those a major tier higher than him would find much difficulty to accomplish this feat.

But in the Immortal Realm?

Sorry, his physique had only surpassed a minor level, and that was too dangerous.

In truth, as long as his battle prowess was over four stars, anyone could possibly injure him because four stars represented a minor level.

Though five-star geniuses were claimed to only exist in myths, there were still such prodigies in reality. Furthermore, Ling Han himself was this kind of prodigy. Thus, the chances that he would meet such geniuses was considerably high.

Hence, his present physique was not invincible among his peers, but only very, very awesome.

“Also, why would it be rising from the ashes?” Ling Han asked.

“You would be cultivating the Indestructible Flame of Life, and just like the Immortal Phoenix, you would be reborn from death by flame,” Small Tower said. “One part of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll is based on the secret technique of the Immortal Phoenix, turning death to life, and that is a supreme secret technique!”

“Immortal Phoenix?” Ling Han asked in surprise. “Not the True Phoenix?”

“Hehe, compared to the Immortal Phoenix, what would a True Phoenix count as?” Small Tower asked with much disdain.

“That Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll would still have to refer to the secret technique of that Divine Beast, er, Celestial Beast?” Ling Han asked curiously.

“Primal Chaos Origin Beast, Thousand Transformations Tortoise, Diamond Ant, they all are the very most supreme beings of the Celestial Realm, and have been melted and fused into one by the Heavenly Venerable Tier to finally nurture the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll!” Small Tower said very proudly. “Of course, the most important thing is that the Heavenly Venerable Tier comprehended the ultimate Regulations, and that is the true essence of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. He had not yet entered into the Celestial Realm, so did not know how awesome the Primal Chaos Origin Beast and Thousand Transformations Tortoise that Small Tower was speaking of were. In any case, all he had to know was that the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was the best and the strongest, and that was enough.

“Come on, then!” Ling Han nodded. He longed for power, whether it was for the sake of overthrowing the Five Sects, or for the Two Realm Prodigy Gathering three years later to meet that Chi Huangji.

“You have to think it through carefully. If you are unable to survive, then you would be completely erased!” Small Tower said seriously. “With your talent, it is not impossible that you would be able to survive the divine flame at the Sun Moon Tier, but the danger would still be very high. And if you undergo it when you are in the Heavenly Body Tier, your chances would be much higher.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Since you have already said that I could survive it, I trust that I definitely can!”

Small Tower nodded, and said, “I will give you three days’ time to revise the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll carefully one more time. You have to completely understand every single detail. This is the key to your being able to survive the tempering by the divine flame. Otherwise... your only path would be death! After that, it will have to depend on your willpower. WIthout the resolve to overcome everything and walk to the end, you will only be completely burnt by the divine flame.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Alright!”

Ling Han meditated beneath the Reincarnation Tree, revising the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll completely, and studying every detail within. After ensuring that he was really capable of channeling it by will, he stood.

Five days’ time had passed, instead of the three days that Small Tower had said.

This was comprehending Dao for a total of five years!

“Let’s begin!” Ling Han said in a deep voice.

Small Tower sent Ling Han to a far place. There was actually a gigantic cauldron here, with an ancient air to it. Ling Han had never seen one like this.

“Yi, why did a cauldron suddenly appear out of nowhere?” Ling Han was surprised. “Small Tower, exactly how many things have you hidden from me?”

Small Tower did not answer.

“Hey, I’m talking to you!” Ling Han called out loudly.

“Oh, were you?” Only now did Small Tower speak up. “I didn’t hear you just now, what were you saying?”

Ling Han repeated his question, but Small Tower was still stupefied.

F***, this tsundere tower hadn’t wanted to reply to him in the first place, and that was why it had acted dumb. Now that he thought about it, he was really naive that he would actually believe that a Tool Spirit would actually experience problems with hearing.

“Go in!” Small Tower shook slightly. The cauldron opened. Hong, ferocious flames immediately shot up into the skies. In comparison, Ao Ziyun’s black flames were practically child’s play.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grit his teeth. Jumping into this kind of divine flame, he would definitely be turned into ashes.

Was this really tempering, or just him going off to his death?

“Remember, the only thing that can save you is the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. You need only continuously channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. As for other matters... forget them completely!” Small Tower said seriously. “To be capable of seeking life in death, and to return by rising from the ashes, that is the key. Don’t ever think of resisting this kind of flame; that is an absolutely impossible thing to do.

“Because they are not divine flames, but immortal flames!”

‘F*ck!’
