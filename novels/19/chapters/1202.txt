Chapter 1203: Turning Hostile

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Hua Faction had great power.

From the second day onwards, there were already people talking about the truth on the Eagle’s Beak Mountain, about how Ling Han had obtained four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid all by himself and created history.

In truth, this was something that had been talked about long ago, but it had immediately been buried underneath the public opinion that was universally against Ling Han. However, now with the Hua Faction moving, it was like how the Gao Faction had easily presented Ling Han as an executioner who killed others to steal their treasure, having as much impact on the people as the previous rumor. The vast power of the Hua Faction was naturally not something that could be matched by any individual entity.

Even when such young king tiers like He Tao and Shen Zhu’er spoke up, it was useless. How could they match the force that had been nurtured for tens of thousands of years by the Hua Faction and Gao Faction?

Now that the Hua Faction and Gao Faction had started their contention, it was naturally impossible that the public opinion would be so one-sided anymore. Instead, it was the clash of two voices. One was smearing Ling Han’s reputation, whereas the other was establishing a positive image of Ling Han.

What the truth was was actually not important. What was important was which of these two factions was stronger.

Unexpectedly, a new faction very soon joined in.

The Hu Faction!

The founder of the Hu Faction was the ninth disciple of the Venerable Trinity. His name was Hu Xiangdi. He did not have any children, and the young master of the Hu Faction was his only disciple. Her name was Lei Linglong, an outstanding beauty.

The Hu Faction’s inclination was... to beat down on Ling Han.

Actually, by now, Ling Han’s matter was no longer important. This had become a stage for the disciples of the Venerable Trinity to show off their power. They were all fighting over the only qualification to obtain the true inheritance, and all wanted to trample over the others.

Or in other words, they were making use of this matter to kick a few people out of their way.

Ling Han was a fuse, and the joining in of the Hua Faction had announced the beginning of this battle.

Next, more disciples of the Venerable Trinity joined in. The Tie Faction, Lang Faction, Nie Faction, Jian Faction, Lu Faction. Out of the nine great disciple, eight disciples had already joined in, and now the situation just happened to be four against four.

Now, it was the only remaining Qu Faction that had yet to make their position clear.

Who would have thought that a mere Mountain River Tier disciple would actually be capable of triggering a fierce battle among the nine great disciples, and that they would display their respective abilities?

But the Hua Faction’s condition had also changed.

Previously, the condition that Ji Yunzhi had set out on behalf of the Hua Faction was being willing to spend an exorbitant amount to purchase a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid, and in exchange, they would help Ling Han dissolve the oppression from the Gao Faction. But when the Tie Faction, Nie Faction, and Lu Faction also joined into the alliance, Ji Yunzhi came to see Ling Han again.

“Apologies, to oppose the alliance of the Gao, Lang, Jiang, and Hu Factions, Young Master was forced to pull in the other three factions for help, but they could not possibly offer their aid for no reason.” Ji Yunzhi smiled apologetically. “Young Master said that we hope that Senior Brother Han could take out all four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Seeing Ling Han’s expression darken, she hurriedly continued, “Naturally, Young Master would not treat Senior Brother Han badly. We can purchase it at 1,000,000 True Origin Stones per drop!”

Are you committing burglary?

Ling Han almost laughed out loud. Previously, when he had been selling alchemical pills at the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, he had earned more than 2,000,000 True Origin Stones, and now, a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid could actually only sell for 1,000,000?

This was a treasure that even Heavenly Body Tiers would prize greatly!

“Your Young Master is a real joker.” Ling Han shook his head. He finally understood. What Hua Faction and Gao Faction? In truth, they were no different—it was just a dogfight. And he had actually placed his hopes on the Hua Faction. He had really been too naive.

Ji Yunzhi was also feeling guilty, but how could she possibly not do as Young Master commanded? She stretched out a hand to press down on Ling Han’s palm, and said, “Senior Brother Han, Young Master Hua will use other means to compensate you.”

Ling Han withdrew his hand, and said, “Hehe, please keep a respectable distance, Junior Sister Ji! I, too, shall offer you a word of advice. A man that can treat you like an item to be freely gifted... Would he really be worth entrusting your whole life to?”

Ji Yunzhi’s beautiful face couldn’t help but shift expressions drastically. Hua Yangwen had commanded that she could sacrifice some of her charms as the situation required to placate Ling Han. In her heart, she was naturally unwilling, but she dared not disobey his command. Now that Ling Han had pointed it out openly, she almost wanted to die in her fury and shame.

“There is no need for Senior Brother Han to worry about my matters!” she said coldly. “Just one word. If you hand over the Thousand Source True Fluid, you can obtain me!”

“Undress! Undress! Undress!” Old ginseng suddenly popped out. This guy’s eyes was already shining brightly. When he heard such seductive words, how could he possibly continue resisting? He had scrambled out from who knows where. “Girl, take off your clothes first, and let Grandpa Ginseng examine you.”

“Get lost!” Ling Han shot out a foot, and Old ginseng was instantly sent flying.

“Ah...” Old ginseng screamed out. “Brat, you are kicking me to the curb when I’m no longer useful! You are having the lion’s share, so can’t you save some scraps for Grandpa Ginseng! A man cannot be so disloyal, you petty brat! You hide all the good stuff for yourself, Grandpa Ginseng ***** you!”

A muscle twitched involuntarily in Ji Yunzhi’s cheek. And what the heck was this?

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively, and said, “Go back, and you won’t have to come again in future. Since Young Master Hua is insincere, then our previous agreement will be completely considered nullified!”

“Senior Brother Han!” A sinister expression appeared on Ji Yunzhi’s face. “Since you have already offended the Gao Faction, if you continue to offend our Hua Faction, you would progress with great difficulty within the sect!”

“Hehe, you speak as if the whole world belongs to you guys,” Ling Han said carelessly. “If you speak a few less words now, I will only detest the Hua Faction at most. But if you continue to garner my dislike, the Hua Faction will also be on my list of future targets.

“I can also offer you a warning. Those listed on my list of targets definitely will not reap any nice fruits!”

A confident smile appeared on his face. There would be a day when he would stride over the Heavenly Body Tier to become Eternal River Tier, and by then, even if Venerable Trinity moved, he would not be able to stop him from seeking justice from the so-called Gao Faction and Hua Faction.

He, the Rain Emperor, Feng Po Yun, Ding Ping... Which one of them was not a genius in his own right? As long as they were given enough time, they would even be able to punch a hole in the heavens!

They should not take unfair advantage of him just because of his youth!

Ji Yunzhi couldn’t help but yield in the face of Ling Han’s forcefulness. After a long while, she finally said, “Since Senior Brother Han is obstinately clinging to his own course, I will report this to Young Master as it is. Excuse me!” She turned and left.

Since their negotiation had soured, there was naturally nothing else that needed to be said. It would only cause their relations to become even worse.

“Brat, you are practically too stupid. Since there was a girl that willingly offered to take off her clothes, why didn’t you just go ahead?” Old ginseng ran back, a perverted expression all over his face.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “You have really reincarnated into the wrong body. Since you love to watch people undress so much, why don’t you go and stay at the public baths?”

“Hehehe, hehehehe!” The old ginseng released a series of mischievous snicker. “How do you know that Grandpa Ginseng hasn’t gone there?”

F***, this perverted ginseng!

Ling Han shook his head, too lazy to squabble with him.

Now that he had also pushed out the Hua Faction, then even if the Hua Faction and the other factions did not fall in with the Gao Faction, there were still as many as four factions targeting Ling Han. Now that things had come so far, the arrow was already notched. No matter if Ling Han had committed a crime or not, they would all have to crucify Ling Han. Otherwise, the four factions would all lose face.

One Gao Faction was already capable of suppressing Ling Han to the point of suffocation, what more when there were now four factions?
