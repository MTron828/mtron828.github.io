Chapter 1349 Silver Dragon Armor

“Earth Armor Guards!” Zhao Ku roared. Numerous chariots instantly flew down from the warship and formed a neat formation behind him.

There were 12 armored warriors on each chariot, and their faces were all filled with killing intent. Auras of death and destruction radiated from their bodies.

The cultivation of these warriors wasn’t high, and they were only at the Mountain River Tier. However, with hundreds upon thousands of them standing together, the aura that they exuded was powerful enough to worry even Sun Moon Tier cultivators.

Zhao Ku raised his hand, and roared, “Enter the formation; kill the enemy!”

Shua!

The warriors all leaped down from their chariots. They then started to sprint along the ground, crisscrossing through each other’s paths in a complex pattern. It was as if the thousands of warriors had become a single entity; it was as if they had become a giant slithering snake.

As they advanced, the armor that they were suited in also radiated with a glow that gradually intertwined. This glow fused their power together, elevating their power several hundred-fold.

This was an extremely peculiar formation.

Ling Han could sense that the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was being ferociously absorbed by them, both from the sky and from the earth. This was the main reason behind their explosive increase in power.

If it were an ordinary person, absorbing Spiritual Qi like this would definitely exceed the limits of their body and blow them up into pieces. However, through the connection of their formation, these warriors were able to evenly distribute the pressure that they faced. As a result, the amount of Spiritual Qi that they could absorb also increased by several hundred-fold.

‘Interesting,’ Ling Han thought to himself with a smile.

It would be nice if he could teach this formation to the soldiers of the Great Ling Empire. That way, they would be able to elevate their overall battle prowess by quite a bit.

“Master, allow me to battle them!” Ding Ping immediately said. He had already reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier, and thus his battle prowess was already extremely close to the Sun Moon Tier.

“Master, this disciple also wants to battle!” Chen Ruijing and his three other disciples also said. They couldn’t allow the youngest disciple to outdo them.

Ling Han nodded with a smile, and said, “Go ahead!”

His five disciples charged toward the enemies. The previous three sects had all surrendered upon seeing Ling Han, so none of them had gotten the chance to battle against enemies. Now that the Earth Dragon Sect was daring to resist, they were naturally itching to charge over and engage in battle.

“Haha, Fourth Brother, you can stay back and guard the rear. Your elder brother is also itching to do battle!” Feng Po Yun said with a hearty laugh.

“Fourth Brother, we’ll leave the rear to you!” Murong Qing was also hungry for some action.

They were all from the Lower Realm, and if it hadn’t been for Ling Han opening the sky, it was extremely likely that they would have all been refined into a Realm Pill by now. Thus, they naturally detested the Five Sects with every fiber of their being. They would feel distressed and pent up if they didn’t pummel the Five Sects with their own two hands.

After Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing both charged into battle, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden turned around to nod at Ling Han, signifying that she would stay back to guard the rear. All Ling Han needed to do was take care of Zhao Ku.

After charging into the enemy formation, the figures of Feng Po Yun and the six others were quickly drowned out by enemy bodies. They appeared especially lonely and fragile among the enemy ranks.

Although Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing hadn’t reached the Sun Moon Tier yet, they had both advanced to the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier already. Thus, they definitely wouldn’t be afraid of the enemy warriors. In fact, they could easily achieve victory even if they were to battle against 10 enemy warriors at once.

However, the warriors had combined their battle prowess through a peculiar formation, which allowed them to possess battle prowess at the Sun Moon Tier. This was definitely beyond what Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing could handle. It wasn’t long before they became bloody and wounded.

Fortunately, there was Ding Ping to look after his two uncles and ensure their safety.

However, this made Feng Po Yun and Murong Qing feel slightly agitated. Back in the Lower Realm, they had all been prodigies and elites, yet they were now being protected by their junior?

This ignited their fighting spirit and sparked their will to fight beyond their limits. If they could maintain this rage and survive the battle, their strength would definitely grow significantly.

Ling Han glanced over and immediately felt at ease. His eyes became as piercing as a sword as he turned his gaze to Zhao Ku.

“What I, Zhao Ku, want, I get!” Zhao Ku said with haughty confidence. “This woman will definitely become my plaything! However, there’s no need for you to worry. I’ll only toy with her for a few days. At most, I’ll only toy with her for a few years. No woman in the world is worthy of staying with me forever!

“Anyhow, with this relationship between us, perhaps I’ll even answer your begging for help if you end up needing my help in the future.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He wore a mocking smile as he said this, and it was clear that he was trying to humiliate Ling Han.

Ling Han used his fingers as a sword and immediately attacked Zhao Ku, saying, “Evil people die from speaking too much!”

Shua!

The power of lightning transformed into an arc of divine lightning that struck at Zhao Ku.

Who in the world could escape from the divine lightning of heavenly tribulation?

Pa!

A streak of bluish-white light flashed across Zhao Ku’s chest before he even had the time to react. Shredded cloth instantly exploded into the air, and even Zhao Ku’s protective Origin Power was unable to prevent the divine lightning from striking his body.

However, as the pieces of shredded cloth cleared, they could all see that Zhao Ku was actually wearing a suit of silver armor beneath his clothing. This suit of armor was filled with divine patterns, which were all pulsating with a soft glow at this moment. This suit of silver armor had completely blocked Ling Han’s burst of divine lightning.

Zhao Ku looked down, and he couldn’t help but laugh loudly, saying, “This is the Silver Dragon Armor that my father bestowed upon me. It’s forged from Level 13 Godly metal, so there’s no way you’ll be able to damage it unless your power can reach the Eternal River Tier!

“Moreover, my father infused a drop of the Moon Tortoise Divine Beast’s blood essence into this Godly metal. In other words, this armor possesses an incredibly powerful defense!

“If you can’t damage my armor, you won’t be able to eliminate the defensive power of my armor. If you can’t eliminate the defensive power of my armor, you won’t be able to hurt even a hair of mine!

“I’m already standing in a position of invincibility, so how are you going to battle against me?”

Zhao Ku wasn’t afraid to reveal the secrets of his Silver Dragon Armor. This was because he was confident that no one below the rank of the Eternal River Tier could defeat him.

‘This is indeed a problem,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

There was a deep frown on his face. The fact that Zhao Ku’s armor was forged from Level 13 Godly metal wasn’t overly important. Regardless of how sturdy it was, it was the armor itself that was sturdy, not its wearer. Even if he couldn’t shatter the armor, he could still deal a huge amount of damage to its wearer through the shock of a powerful strike. However, the problem was that this armor had been infused with a drop of the Moon Tortoise’s blood essence. The addition of this blood essence had added an extra defensive barrier around the armor.

In fact, there were two methods to breach this defensive barrier. The first was to shatter the defensive barrier, and the second was to shatter the Silver Dragon Armor.

However, both of these feats required that his power reach the Eternal River Tier, yet Ling Han was only at the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier.

‘Sigh, why is it so hard to kill this person?’

“Hahaha, are you feeling helpless now? Are you feeling despair now?” Zhao Ku couldn’t help but laugh heartily. He loved obliterating the willpower of his opponents. Seeing the looks of despair on their faces filled him with a sense of intense satisfaction.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Perhaps the helpless person will soon be you!”

“Me?” Zhao Ku faltered for a moment before exploding into laughter. “Have you gone stupid? How is that possible?”

“How is it not possible?” Ling Han charged over, yet his target wasn’t Zhao Ku. Instead, it was the members of the Earth Dragon Sect. He threw a strike, and a devastating power instantly hammered into the earth.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Many members of the Earth Dragon Sect were instantly smashed into pieces. Both their bodies and divine senses were obliterated.

“You...” Zhao Ku was infuriated by this.

He naturally couldn’t care less about the lives of the people. However, Ling Han actually dared to disregard his presence!

‘You dare to ignore me?!’

Zhao Ku roared in anger before opening his mouth to spit out a miniature sword. This sword gradually grew in size, eventually transforming into a three feet long azure sword. He gripped this sword in his hand and made a slashing motion at Ling Han. Sword light instantly surged out, forming into a giant black snake that widened its jaws and bit at Ling Han.
