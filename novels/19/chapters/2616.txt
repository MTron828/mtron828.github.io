Chapter 2617: Slain with a Single Cut

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Describing this was time-consuming, but in reality, it only took Xu Huan an instant to summon these 81 Seventh Heaven evil spirits that were bellowing at Ling Han.

This was a petrifying scene. This was a whopping 81 evil spirits! This was enough to send those at the early stage of the Eighth Heaven into retreat!

Everyone shook their head. The conclusion was already foregone. Regardless of how powerful Ling Han was, there was simply no way that he could reach the Eighth Heaven. Thus, his only fate was to be devoured by these evil spirits.

This was the might of a Celestial Tool!

“Hahaha! Before a Celestial Tool, how are you going to turn the tables?” Xu Huan said with arrogance. This was the source of his confidence. “Kneel down and accept death! That way, I can consider granting you a swift death!”

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “I merely wanted to observe the might of your Celestial Tool. You truly think that I can’t defeat you?”

“You’re already staring at death, yet you still dare to act with such arrogance?” Xu Huan scoffed.

“Hurry up and kneel!” Zhao Qing and the others heckled. Right now, they were standing in a position of absolute advantage.

“You people are nothing but frogs in a well,” Ling Han said faintly.

Whoosh!

The Divine Demon Sword flashed into existence.

A cold gleam immediately cut through the air.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

All of the evil spirits were immediately slashed into two.

However, Xu Huan wasn’t fazed in the least. These evil spirits didn’t have a physical body, and they were instead the divine senses of those that the Celestial Tool had killed. They were trapped in the Soul Extinguishing Drum for eternity. Thus, it mattered little that they were cleft in half, since they could immediately knit together again.

“Your struggle is futile!” he sneered in disdain. However, in the next instant, his eyes almost popped out of his head.

This was because even though the evil spirits squirmed in a struggle to knit back together, they couldn’t do so no matter what. All they could do was squirm around in vain.

‘How is this possible?!

‘The attack of the Celestial Tool is this flimsy?!’

What he didn’t know was that Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword was also a Celestial Tool. Moreover, it was a Celestial Tool that had engulfed a huge amount of Divine Metal. Even though it still had yet to become a Heavenly Venerate Tool, it was at least far more powerful than ordinary Divine Metal.

While facing heavenly tribulation before, Ling Han had funneled the power of the lightning tribulation into his sword. Even though the latter hadn’t been able to absorb much of this power, being tempered by an Eighth Heaven heavenly tribulation had still raised its might by a significant amount.

The might of this slash… could rival the attacks of Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings!

Ling Han’s power was at an absolute advantage, so with the sharpness and destructiveness of the Divine Demon Sword, he was naturally able to cut the evil spirits in two. Moreover, they were unable to knit back together no matter what. If it couldn’t achieve even this, wouldn’t the Divine Demon Sword be nothing more than an ordinary Celestial Tool?

Everyone was rendered speechless with shock. The drum in Xu Huan’s hand was a Celestial Tool! Moreover, it was one that had been personally forged by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King! Even though it hadn’t unleashed its full might, it had still summoned 81 Seventh Heaven evil spirits, enough to terrify even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings!

Yet, Ling Han had disposed of them with a single slash.

Peng!

‘How is he so powerful? How can he possibly be so powerful?!’

Ling Han lowered his sword. He then looked at Xu Huan, and asked, “Do you have any more trump cards?”

Xu Huan’s expression changed again and again. He was truly unable to accept Ling Han’s arrogance. However, what could he do? Even his Celestial Tool had failed to suppress Ling Han! He had no option but to call his father for help.

However, it was a pity that his father had already entered the Ancient Tomb long ago. Thus, how could distant water save a nearby fire?

“You got me this time!” Xu Huan was someone who was able to swallow his pride. He forcefully suppressed his rage, and turned around to leave. When he regrouped with his father, he would ask him to deal with this brat.

“Who allowed you to leave,” Ling Han said calmly.

“You still want me to stay?” Xu Huan retorted in a haughty voice. His father was none other than Xu Fang. Not only was he a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but he was more so a monarch star. He was powerful enough to flatten any city in the Celestial King Graveyard.

Moreover, the Xu Clan still had the support of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “If that’s all, then you can die now!” He unleashed a punch at Xu Huan.

Just then, Ling Han hadn’t attacked, because he had wanted to see what other trump cards Xu Huan had. However, since the latter had nothing else, there was naturally no need for Ling Han to hold back anymore.

“What? You actually dare to target me?!” Xu Huan was both astonished and enraged. Did Ling Han not know who he was?

He hurriedly struck the Soul Extinguishing Drum again, summoning evil spirit after evil spirit. As long as he had energy, he could continue to summon evil spirits to support him.

Peng!

However, the evil spirits were immediately obliterated by Ling Han’s punch. Right now, Ling Han’s battle prowess could already rival that of Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, so how could measly Seventh Heaven evil spirits withstand the might of his fist?

Xu Huan hurriedly retreated as he continued to strike the Soul Extinguishing Drum. However, even though he had the help of a Celestial Tool, unleashing Seventh Heaven attacks while at the Sixth Heaven was still extremely taxing—so much so that he wanted to vomit blood.

If this continued, even if Ling Han didn’t kill him, he would still die from exhaustion.

He couldn’t help but roar, “Do you know who I am? I’m the son of Xu Fang! My father is a Ninth Heaven monarch star, and he’s powerful enough to flatten a city by himself! My ancestor is more so a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate! If you dare to kill me, my father definitely won’t forgive you. Moreover, even if you manage to flee from the Celestial King Graveyard, my ancestor will still be able to sense your aura. Even if you flee to the ends of the world, you still won’t be able to escape death!”

Second Tier Heavenly Venerate! This was truly a transcendent existence. Indeed, they could guarantee a First Tier Heavenly Venerate battle prowess regardless of which dimension they went to.

However, Ling Han didn’t stop. His path was filled with obstacles to overcome, and his dao was one that surged forward with courage. If he shirked because of his fear of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, his accomplishments would only be so.

His principles were extremely simple. If others didn’t provoke him, then he wouldn’t provoke others. If others provoked him, however, he would repay them with 100 times the fury!

Xu Huan continued to vomit blood. He was truly striking the Soul Extinguishing Drum as if his life depended on it. However, each evil spirit was destroyed in a flash, unable to linger around and group together with other evil spirits to trigger a qualitative change.

However, if he didn’t summon these evil spirits, he would be killed even sooner.

Right now, his only option was to resist in vain. Even though he knew that he would eventually die from exhaustion, he still had no option but to commit to this tactic.

“Attack him together!” Zhao Qing immediately shouted. If this continued, Xu Huan would definitely be killed.

However, the six other people shook in fear. With Xu Huan’s strength, and with the help of a Celestial Tool, he was still utterly suppressed by Ling Han. Thus, what difference could they make?

Did they have Celestial Tools? Were they at the Sixth Heaven?

“Sister Qing, we should hurry up and flee!”

“That’s right, staying alive is the most important. As long as we find the lords, we can definitely hurry back to save Young Master Xu!”

They all shot back in retreat, not daring to seek death.

Zhao Qing couldn’t help but feel frustrated and angry. To say nothing of how difficult it would be to find Xu Fang and the others, even if they found them, how long would that take? At that time, perhaps grass would already be growing before Xu Huan’s tombstone.

‘This bunch of cowards!’

With a roar, she unsheathed her sword and charged at Ling Han. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She wasn’t just a friend of Xu Huan. Rather, she was his fiancee, and they had already become engaged long ago. Moreover, she was extremely satisfied with her fiance, and she had extremely high hopes for him.

Zhao Qing joined the battle, with her sword drawing down waves of fire.

Ling Han turned around, and pointed a finger at Zhao Qing.

Pu!

The flames were instantly extinguished, and a small hole instantly appeared in Zhao Qing’s chest. Her aura crashed down.

Xiu!

Seizing this opportunity, Xu Huan immediately turned around to flee, not caring about his fiancee at all.

“Xu Huan!” Zhao Qing exclaimed in shock and disbelief. She hadn’t imagined that her bravery would win her such betrayal.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “How pathetically shameless!” His eyes were intense and ice-cold. Did Xu Huan truly think that he could escape? How naive!
