Chapter 1868: Victory

Cheng Fengyun’s mouth gaped open, big enough to fit an egg.

‘What the f*ck?!

‘Aren’t you the Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect? Aren’t you the supreme calamity that would only appear once in millions and millions of years?

‘F***, you actually admit defeat directly without even fighting.

‘Judge, I want to make a report, there’s something fishy going on here!’

Even if Cheng Fengyun’s mental activity was incredibly high, he could not say a single word.

What could he say?

The tournament rules did not say that taking the initiative to admit defeat was disallowed. How could it be that he could force Bewitching Maiden Rou to fight with Ling Han?

Running naked, he would have to run naked... He felt his vision darken.

Whether it was eating stone, or slapping himself, he could accept all of that. But to run naked, and be completely bared to the public eye, this was really something that he could not accept. But the problem was that these words were a boast that he had personally made.

Just see, he had brought evil onto himself, hadn’t he?

His eyes wandered, and saw that every person in his vicinity was looking at him smilingly.

“I will take it off!” he announced loudly. Young Master Cheng’s character was definitely good regarding gambling.

After exiting the arena, Bewitching Maiden Rou set off in pursuit.

“Brother Ling, why didn’t you go to Roc Palace?” This bewitching maiden was extremely alluring. She was clearly speaking about something serious, but gave off the feeling as if she was lying on the bed and whispering soft words, immediately inciting dangerous thoughts.

Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden instantly became alert. She was not the Empress who had the confidence to look down on the whole world. She was only a little woman, and definitely did not hope that Ling Han would find other women.

Thus, she maintained a strong dislike towards Bewitching Maiden Rou, and did not hope that she was too close with Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled. “It’s hard to explain.”

He did not want to speak of his own misfortunes, how he would encounter two great elites exchanging blows when he had been on his way, and was innocently implicated, and had the Black Murderous Curse planted in him by Old Demon Blood Shadow.

“Oh!” Bewitching Maiden Rou was a little displeased. ‘Why are you always so cool towards me? Did I offend you?’

Damn man, so despicable!

She was cursing in her heart, but the smile on her face became even sweeter and more alluring. The techniques of the Purity Sect were like this. The crueler and fiercer you were towards me, the more beautifully I would still smile. Otherwise, this technique could not be unleashed.

Unfortunately, this kind of charm technique did not have the slightest effect on Ling Han. He waved a hand, and strode off.

Bewitching Maiden Rou could only stomp her feet in rage. It was the first time she had encountered a man that completely did not fall for her charms, and she was completely helpless.

A day later, Ling Han was matched with the last opponent of the first level, a man called “Shu”. He had no surname. However, that might not be his name, but only a codename.

This man looked very ordinary, and his journey all the way here had been bumpy as well. He had only narrowly won over every opponent, but the crux of the matter was that no matter how strong his opponent would be, he would always manage to win.

Ling Han stood facing him. Shu did not have a tall build, and had average looks, belonging to that category that would definitely not attract any notice in a crowd. Furthermore, there was not the slightest sliver of aura that escaped from him. He really was like a completely ordinary person.

Merely in this aspect, he was already not ordinary.

Being able to control the aura in his body such that not a bit would seep out like this was the display of the strongest.

“Young Master Cheng...” On the spectators’ seats, everyone once again looked towards Cheng Fengyun.

One could not help but be impressed by this person. He had eaten stone, slapped himself, and run naked in public, but he actually still managed to arrive on time. There was really no one that could compare to his toughness.

Cheng Fengyun shook his head repeatedly. Today, he was not going to give a commentary even if it killed him.

‘I will only be a quiet, handsome guy today.’

Everyone couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Their enjoyment had decreased a bit.

In the arena, Ling Han made a gesture of invitation, and said, “Make your move!”

He did not take his opponent lightly. Being able to charge all the way into the top eight, there would definitely not be any weaklings. Perhaps he was like him too—incredibly powerful.

Shu set his eyes on Ling Han, and bared his mouth in a grin. However, this grin was terrifying. He actually didn’t have any teeth nor a tongue. There was actually a dead man’s face in his mouth, smiling eerily at Ling Han.

Even if Ling Han was extremely brave, he couldn’t help but feel his heart tremble, and a coldness rose up in him.

Right at this moment, Shu’s figure flashed, and he had already charged towards Ling Han. His right hand was raised, holding a thin sword.

This was really a thin sword, not much wider than a hair. As cold light flashed, xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu, he pierced out at Ling Han.

His speed was really too high. In an instant, he had already delivered countless stabs. It clearly was only a thin sword, but because it was too fast, it seemed as if blades were raining down. The air itself was forcibly pierced through as power of Regulation flailed.

‘So powerful!’

Cheng Fengyun was dumbfounded, and immediately felt incredible regret. F***! Why didn’t he make a bet today? He could have won!

He really wanted to stomp his feet in fury. He had already been stifled for a good few days, and even in his dreams he wanted to see Ling Han lose, and then pass judgment to release the gloomy feelings in his heart. But when the chance came, he had actually missed it.

Everyone was also dazzled by the scene. Who would believe that an average-looking person would actually burst out with this kind of battle prowess?

Ling Han actually didn’t have the slightest ability to counter in front of this opponent. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, Shu did not look the slightest bit proud. Others might not know, but he was very clear. Ling Han seemed to have sustained innumerable stabs, but not a single blade had truly stabbed into Ling Han’s body.

The latter was truly strong, having the power of Regulation to defend himself. It was like great dao had wrapped around him. No matter how he attacked, it was completely ineffective.

Right at this moment, Ling Han suddenly moved, and looked towards him.

Shu couldn’t help but feel his heart freeze. He hurriedly bounced back, and retreated. The feeling this opponent gave him was like he was looking at a tall mountain. If it did not move, you could be a little wilful, but the moment it countereed, then the earth would crack, mountains would collapse, and seas overturn.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “Not too bad. Among the opponents that I have encountered these days, you can be ranked at the top.” This person had battle prowess close to emperor tier. Even if he had met the likes of Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng, he would be able to exchange one or two blows.

Too bad, the person he encountered was him.

Ling Han moved, and his five fingers stretched out, pressing out at Shu.

The palm had not landed, but the aura was already like a heavy mountain, exerting so much pressure that Shu sweated like mad. He felt completely scared out of his wits, and wanted to dodge, but it was as if lead had been poured into his legs. He couldn’t move at all.

However, he was an existence that was close to emperor tier, after all!

Shu gave a battle cry and struggled free of the pressure Ling Han exerted on his spirit, once again brandishing his sword in attack.

Even if he was defeated, he wanted to be defeated in battle.

Boom!

In this clash of two strikes, Shu was sent flying outwards, and fell onto the ground, no longer being able to get back up.

On the spectators’ seats, it was once again dead silence.

Everyone had initially thought Ling Han would definitely lose, but had never imagined that they would have barely even finished the thought when Ling Han would have already turned the tables around and won. This turn of events had really happened too quickly.

Meanwhile, Cheng Fengyun secretly marveled at his luck and felt lingering fear. Thankfully, he hadn’t made a bet today. Otherwise... he had best wait until they were at the fourth level so the freaks there could deal with Ling Han.

After this day ended, the four strongest from the first level had all been determined, and they were Ling Han, Zhang Quan, He Yue, and Yang Biyue.

Aside from Ling Han, the other three were all heirs of three-star forces, having the aptitude of king tier. Otherwise, they couldn’t have possibly emerged victorious from this kind of fierce competition.

They did not return to their original accommodations, but had rather been gathered together, They would immediately go to the fourth level, and the contest for the final rounds would begin the very next day.

Ling Han was also very expectant. There were even better Time Cultivation Chambers on the fourth level. He wanted to concoct his first cauldron of Celestial pills as soon as possible.

Once he succeeded, he could use this as a stepping stone, and open the doors to the interior of Alchemy City.
