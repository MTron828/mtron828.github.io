Chapter 2013: Invitation to battle from the natives

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head internally.

When they had encountered disaster on the seas, everyone could still share their joys and sorrows together, but now that they were saved and had escaped, each of them showed their selfish nature.

‘Forget it. Since you all have no wish to continue sharing the same boat, I, too, will no longer care for your life or death.’

Ling Han waved a hand dismissively, and smilingly said, “Since you people do not want to stick together anymore, this is where we part then.”

“Ling Han, you really are an ungrateful guy!” someone rebuked. “Lord Qin kindly allowed you to board, yet you do not have the slightest feeling of gratitude. You really are a beast!”

“That’s right. This is too inhumane.”

“I am ashamed to be in the same party as you.”

Everyone rebuked him, and even Qin Wei showed an expression of disgust.

Ling Han was shocked. He had indeed been taken in by Qin Wei, and this was a fact. But at the time, they had an agreement. He had not boarded the ship as a guest, but would rather help in powering the formation, and provide power for the large ship.

This was a fair transaction.

Moreover, when the tsunami had taken place, had he not done his best?

It could be said that without his all-out efforts, the large ship possibly couldn’t have even held out until the final tsunami wave, and would have long since shattered. Then, just how many people would have been able to stand here and criticize him now would be a question that was left unanswered.

On the other hand, Ling Han possessed the Black Tower, so there was no need for him to worry at all about life threatening danger.

Hehe, talking about ingratitude, these people were the truly ungrateful ones!

Ling Han did not speak further. Since they had endured calamity together, he did not bother to lower himself to the level of these people, but had also drawn a clear dividing line between himself and these people. From now onwards, they were no longer the slightest bit related to him.

“Hehe, it’s all right. It’s all right.” Instead, it was Xiao Jun that smiled and played mediator. “My master obtained a treasure that had been left behind by an ancient great elite, and cultivated a unique cultivation technique, and traveled another path. That is why everyone cannot distinguish our cultivation levels.”

Ancient great elite, unique cultivation technique!

Everyone immediately became excited by these few words, and couldn’t help but recall what Qin Wei had said. There were treasures hidden in the boundless seas. It looked like the master of these three people had obtained a rare treasure.

Anything that involved the ancient era meant that it was powerful.

“The three of us... are the equivalent of Yang Soul,” Luo He continued.

“Oh!” Everyone nodded.

Yet Ling Han’s heart shuddered. Yang Soul Tier?

But going by his instincts, these three possessed the battle prowess of Earth Soul at least, and he trusted his instincts very much.

Then there was only one possibility left.

These three people were all monarch tiers!

Three monarch tiers had appeared at the same time on a tiny island?

Was this even possible?

Ling Han thought that the chances of this were very small, but how could the abnormal strength of these three people be explained otherwise?

Strange.

“Come, come this way.” Xiao Jun and the others deliberately slowed their steps so that everyone could easily survey the scenery as they passed. The trees here were very tall, but they were all a myriad of colors and very beautiful.

After walking for about an hour, they finally arrived in front of the structure that they had previously glimpsed.

This was an ancient castle, and should have existed for many, many years. The walls of the ancient castle were covered with moss, exuding the aura of age that came with time.

“Please.”

Everyone had thought that it would only be Xiao Jun and the others that were residing here in this ancient castle, but they had not thought that there was really a considerable number of people present. There were men and women, old and young, and they were all cultivators. However, just like Xiao Jun and his group, no matter how strong they were, their cultivation level could not be identified.

Though the others also thought this was strange, they did not take it to heart. That was because Xiao Jun had previously said that their master had obtained an ancient cultivation technique, taking a different path. In that case, it was very normal that they could not distinguish their cultivation levels.

Ling Han, meanwhile, was even more curious. That was because he saw the two stone statues that were placed on either side of the doors when he entered through the great doors of the ancient castle.

Those were two human figures, but wings sprouted from their backs, while their feet were like the hooves of oxen, and there was a long tail that trailed behind them as well, with horns growing from their foreheads. This kind of creature... Ling Han had never seen such before.

Was it.... really as simple as having cultivated an ancient cultivation technique?

The people inside the ancient castle were all very cordial. When they saw Ling Han and his group enter, they all rushed over and greeted them. Some took out food and wine, inviting them to be guests at their homes.

“Haha, guests should suit the convenience of the host, and just relax,” Xiao Jun said. “Master is presently in seclusion. He may occasionally come out of seclusion, and then I will inform him. Perhaps Master would be very willing to receive all these guests.”

Everyone nodded. It was already very kind that the islanders were willing to provide them with temporary shelter. Whether the main host was willing to grant them an audience naturally depended on his mood. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

They did not dare be impudent, either. There were a few people in the ancient palace that had frightening auras. Even if their cultivation level was not clear, they could feel that they were extremely strong, and should be comparable to Immortal Palace Tier.

Everyone had finally settled down. However, Xiao Jun had said that everything on the island belonged to the Island Master, who was also their master. Without obtaining the agreement of the Island Master, they could not take a single blade of grass or a twig from the island.

Thus, everyone could not cut down trees to build a ship now, and could only silently wait for the Island Master to speak.

However, a few days later, Xiao Jun once again appeared. It was still the three youths together, and they invited all the outsiders over as guests.

With an invitation from the host, what more when they had something to ask of the other, they naturally could not refuse. Everyone arrived at the training ground of the ancient castle at the time agreed upon.

Xiao Jun and his group were not the only people here. There were also a great many residents of the ancient castle here, but everyone was separated on two clearly different sides.

Honestly, the training ground was not big, and there were only about 100 spectators’ seats. However, the sparring area of the training ground used Regulations of Space. It looked small, but was actually huge, so there was no need to worry that the fighters could not go into full swing due to limits of space.

Everyone sat down, and maids served fragrant tea to them, so their reception was quite thoughtful.

“Brother Xiao, has the Island Master spoken?” Qin Wei couldn’t help but ask. He had the highest cultivation level out of their party of survivors, and was also a member of the Qin Clan, so he had full reason to lead everyone back onto the mainland.

Thus, what he was most concerned about was also the matter of their return.

Xiao Jun shook his head, and said, “Lord Qin, don’t be anxious. My master is presently comprehending a technique, and without his approval, none of us would dare disturb him without permission, so please stay here for some time longer.”

Qin Wei could only shut his mouth at this, and suppress the anxiety in his heart.

“Brother Xiao, why have you invited us here today?” someone who was rasher immediately asked.

Luo He smiled, and said, “All of us are cultivators, and we have stayed overseas for a long time, being overly subjective and disregarding the outside world. Thus, we would like to have a spar with all of you so we can also be made aware of our own inadequacies.”

Hearing these words, everyone showed an expression of pride.

That was natural. You people had only obtained an ancient technique, but how could a single ancient technique be enough? The strength of cultivators would also be affected by celestial techniques, as well as battle experience, his own natural talent, and other such factors.

In any case, being overly subjective and disregarding the outside world definitely would not do. If you could not overwhelm your opponent with your superior cultivation level, you would definitely be no match in a battle of equal cultivation levels.

“I am Feng Dang, and my cultivation level should be equivalent to the fourth severance. Which of you are willing to spar with me?” A youth jumped out, his hair flying gracefully, having a kind of wild charm.

“I will!” A person also leaped out from Qin Wei’s party, but he was no young man. Instead, he was a middle-aged man that looked to be in his early fifties.

However, in the Celestial Realm, age was definitely no issue, as long as they could bear up against the Immortal’s Tribulation.

“Please!” Feng Dang raised his clasped hands, and immediately charged out.

Peng!

A figure streaked past, and Feng Dang was the only person that was standing where he had once stood.

Instant victory.
