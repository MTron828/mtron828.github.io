Chapter 2434: Coming to the Rescue

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered correcting Yu Wudi. This man was a walking corpse, so was there any need to waste his breath?

Ling Han unleashed his full strength, combining his Body Arts with his power of Regulations. Even though his Vitality Index couldn’t surpass 5000, his battle prowess had indeed risen to a new height. Regardless of what Yu Wudi did, he was unable to turn the tables.

“Aaah!” Yu Wudi bellowed in anger. He was filled with rage. He was only a tiny bit away! He could almost ingest the Crimson Demonic Earth again! However, even though he was so close, he was unable to hold on any longer. He was going to lose his life here.

He was naturally unwilling to die here. He had been sealed for several epochs, and he had also been an invincible prodigy during his time!

However, Ling Han’s punches grew heavier and heavier, slowly forcing him to the brink.

Peng!

A fist swung over, and Yu Wudi was unable to defend himself any longer. The fist instantly struck his forehead. With Ling Han’s devastating power, this fist was definitely powerful enough to pulverize his head into pieces.

“Huh?” Astonishment spread across Ling Han’s face. Even though his fist had struck Yu Wudi, it hadn’t struck anything physical.

It was the might of that Celestial Tool!

Golden-purple light pulsated, and energy that was far superior to the First Heaven burst into the surroundings, rushing at Ling Han. Even though Ling Han had already had a bad premonition, and even though he had already channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he still felt like his entire right arm had been shattered by the overwhelming collision.

Moreover, his internal organs had also been severely wounded by this collision. He felt indescribably miserable.

A paramount aura hung over the sky as a nine-colored iridescent light hovered above the staff, transforming into the figure of a middle-aged man.

The Imperial Void Celestial King!

Yu Wudi was delighted upon seeing this. Even he hadn’t known that his father had hidden a wisp of his intent in this Celestial Tool. Perhaps the Imperial Void Celestial King hadn’t wanted his son to grow too dependent on him, so he had kept this a secret. However, this wisp of intent would be activated if his son ever encountered life-threatening danger.

Ling Han channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, allowing his wounds to rapidly heal. However, he had been struck by a Celestial Tool, so his wounds couldn’t heal immediately.

He silently reminded himself not to underestimate others. Otherwise, he might truly lose his life due to carelessness.

“Hahaha!” Yu Wudi roared with laughter. Who could have imagined that the tables would turn so suddenly? Right now, Ling Han was severely wounded, and he could imminently ingest some Crimson Demonic Earth again. Soon, it would be his turn to pummel Ling Han.

“Brat, don’t be so full of yourself! Showing off will get you killed off!” he taunted. Even though his father had only left a wisp of his intent, this was already enough to activate the Celestial Tool. Moreover, even though this Celestial Tool had been forged by the Imperial Void Celestial King long ago, he had already been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at that time. As such, this tool was profoundly powerful.

With this Celestial Staff, he was essentially undying and invincible. Did he need to fear anyone?

Ling Han smiled faintly. He refused to believe that the Imperial Void Celestial King’s wisp of intent could last forever. Thus, once this wisp of intent disappeared, he could suppress and kill Yu Wudi just like before.

He definitely had to kill him. To say nothing of Yin Wudi’s arrogance, just his relationship with the Imperial Void Celestial King was already reason enough.

“The same back at you! Showing off will get you killed off!” Ling Han said.

“Die!” Yu Wudi roared as he swept his staff at Ling Han. Because he was no longer in danger of death at this moment, his staff also lost its might. After all, this was the Celestial Path, a place that Celestial Kings couldn’t enter at all. In fact, only powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings such as the Imperial Void Celestial Kings could leave a wisp of their intent inside a Celestial Tool to activate it.

Thus, this wisp of intent had naturally been extremely weak and fragile. It was only because of this that it had been able to deceive heaven and earth. Moreover, it was only natural that it would only activate when Yu Wudi encountered life-threatening danger.

Ling Han humphed as he replied with a punch.

Peng!

The Celestial staff was immediately blasted back, almost prying itself from Yu Wudi’s grip.

Yu Wudi was astonished. He had thought that Ling Han was severely wounded and almost on the brink of death. After all, this was a Celestial Tool that had been forged by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King! In fact, this tool could easily kill even First Heaven Celestial Kings!

However, Ling Han’s powerful counterattack told him otherwise. It told him that Ling Han was far less affected than he had imagined. Quite the contrary, in fact. Ling Han’s battle prowess was still near its peak.

How was this possible? His father had personally forged this Celestial Tool!

He was unable to accept this. Just what kind of freak was Ling Han? To say nothing of such a freak, he had been the only monarch star during his time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been invincible among his peers.

Yu Wudi stood with his staff. Right now, his task was extremely simple. He needed to buy enough time so that he could ingest the Crimson Demonic Earth again. At that time, he could definitely turn the tables and achieve victory. This was because Ling Han had surely ingested the Crimson Demonic Earth before him.

Of course, his confidence was built on the assumption that no one could unleash a battle prowess at the Celestial King Tier without ingesting Crimson Demonic Earth. However, who told Ling Han to be such a freakish being? He was indeed such a heaven-defying existence.

Ling Han continued his furious attacks. At this moment, his wounds had already been fully healed by the Indestructible True Fluid. He was still brimming with power. As long as the Celestial Tool didn’t unleash its might, what challenge could Yu Wudi pose?

With his experience from just then, he naturally wouldn’t put himself in danger anymore. He stood further away from Yu Wudi as he attacked him. This caused his attacks to become weaker, but he was much more powerful than Yu Wudi, so he could easily corner the latter and place him in a deadly situation. Because of this, the wisp of Celestial King intent in the golden-purple Celestial Staff was activated time and time again.

After several dozen times, it was extremely clear that the Imperial Void Celestial King’s projection was becoming fainter and fainter. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This signified that the Imperial Void Celestial King’s wisp of intent could save his son several dozen times. Indeed, this was a reflection of just how much he cared about his son. However, who could have imagined that he would come across a freak like Ling Han on the Celestial Path? Before long, he had already been pushed to the brink of despair.

“Detestable! Damn it!” Yu Wudi roared. However, in order to train him, the Imperial Void Celestial King’s wisp of intent could only protect him. It wouldn’t attack his opponent. Thus, he was completely unable to rival Ling Han.

Perhaps he was truly going to die here?

Yu Wudi involuntarily shivered upon thinking of this.

From birth until now, he had never considered that there would come a day when he would die.

He had a near-invincible father, and he was more so a monarch star himself. He was a prodigy destined to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He didn’t need to worry about Immortal’s Tribulation at all. Now, however, the sword of death was already resting against his neck.

Right at this moment, however, a look of delight suddenly washed across his face. This was an expression of raging delight.

He could ingest the Crimson Demonic Earth again!

“Your time is over!” Yu Wudi said with a loud laugh. He hurriedly retrieved and ingested some Crimson Demonic Earth, causing his aura to instantly soar. He brimmed with power as he reached the Celestial King Tier.

“Die!” He unleashed a furious attack, his golden-purple staff dancing and weaving with domineering might.

Right now, his strength was already incredibly close to that of Celestial Kings. Thus, he could naturally unleash some of the might of the Celestial Tool, causing his battle prowess to elevate to a new height.

Ling Han stopped attacking with his fists. Instead, he started to wield his Divine Demon Sword. Right now, the might of the golden-purple staff was far too great, so much so that the Celestial King Tier ring was already unable to rival it. Thus, he had to unleash the might of the Divine Demon Sword.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two Pseudo-Celestial Kings did battle with their Celestial Tools, elevating the intensity of the battle to a new height. The ordinary cultivators below could only gawk on in amazement.

Yu Wudi became increasingly ferocious as he fought. After being suppressed by Ling Han for so long, there was a flaming ball of anger in his chest. He was yearning to suppress Ling Han so that he could finally vent his anger.

However, Ling Han remained unafraid, with his stamina immense and boundless.

After battling for another 30 minutes, Yu Wudi’s expression involuntarily changed.

Why was Ling Han’s battle prowess still so great? It wasn’t declining at all!

F*ck! He had already ingested the Crimson Demonic Earth for a long time!
