Chapter 2505: Traitor

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

10 people appeared, blocking the entry into the mountains for Ling Han and the others.

“Who are you people?” Luo Xing demanded immediately.

A bearded middle-aged man from the other side rubbed his chin and grinned. “It is not important who we are. What is important is that all of you will have to stay here, and have a nice chat with us.”

“Seventh Brother Ma, we have no wish to chat with three men.” Immediately, someone joined in the excitement.

“That’s right. Even if we want to chat, it has to be with a woman.”

“This young miss is quite pretty. Haha, we love talking and chatting with this kind of woman.”

“And it has to be an ‘open-minded’ chat?too1.”

These people all laughed raucously. Though their words were very indecent, there was no hint of anything perverted or lewd in their expressions. Their goal seemed to be to only anger Li Juan and the others.

Though Li Juan very much wanted to suppress her fury, she was still trembling with anger, flames of rage flickering in her eyes.

“To dare act so insolently in front of the entrance of our Duplicate Moon Sect, you people are truly outrageously bold!” Luo Xing declared menacingly. He had already drawn a long saber. Light reflected off the saber’s blade, emitting an intimidating chill.

“I am so afraid!” One of the people who had blocked their way wrapped his arms around himself, and then erupted into loud laughter. “Duplicate Moon Sect? After a few more years, it will be hard to say whether this sect will still even exist.”

“How dare you!” Luo Xing and the others rebuked at the same time.

“Hehe, your Lord Sect Master is busy maintaining the vital signs for your Lady Sect Mistress. As long as your Lady Sect Mistress never recovers, your Lord Sect Master will only become weaker and weaker,” one the people who had intercepted them said, bearing a strange smile on his face.

Luo Xing and the others were startled, and then immediately looked stunned. “Could it be… you are members of the Red Flower Sect?”

“You guessed correctly!” one of the people who had intercepted them replied.

“Hiss, could it be that Lord Sect Mistress’s illness is the result of one of your ploys?” Luo Xing exclaimed in shock.

“Another correct guess!” These people who had blocked their way were all laughing loudly.

The expressions of Luo Xing and his group changed drastically. From the look of things now, this matter was entirely a conspiracy from the very beginning.

The Red Flower Sect was a direct competitor of the Duplicate Moon Sect. Who knew how many years the two sects had been clashing for to contend for a bountiful mine, which produced precious divine stones; in fact, it was possible that even Divine Metal could be mined from it.

Thus, this was a site that they would definitely fight over, and for the sake of this, who knew how many years the two great Sects had been fighting for.

The strongest elite of the Duplicate Moon Sect was naturally their lord sect master, whose name was Azure Sun Celestial King, and his cultivation level had reached the Second Heaven.

And the Azure Sun Celestial King was the only Celestial King in the Duplicate Moon Sect. Thus, as long as he was gotten rid of, it would naturally be an easy matter to destroy the Duplicate Moon Sect.

The Red Flower Sect had finally found an opening as well, and that was the wife of the Azure Sun Celestial King—Azure Sun Celestial King loved her deeply.

Have the sect master’s wife fall ill so that the Azure Sun Celestial King would have to endlessly use his own power to maintain her vital signs. As long as the sect master’s wife did not recover, the Azure Sun Celestial King’s battle prowess would be restrained, and eventually, there would come a day when his vitality would be greatly wounded.

That way, when the Red Flower Sect launched a heavy assault, the Duplicate Moon Sect could possibly crumble overnight.

Being able to reach the Ascending Origin Tier, Luo Xing and his group naturally could not be fools. Immediately, they guessed the truth behind the matter, and couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.

This was a conspiracy, but it was also an overt conspiracy because even if the Azure Sun Celestial King knew, so what? Would he cease his actions?

No wonder these people wanted to stop them from returning to the sect. They naturally could not allow the lady sect mistress to recover from her illness.

“You people… are too despicable!” Luo Xing and his group rebuked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Hehe, who asked your lord sect master to be a romantic?” The people who had blocked their path all laughed loudly. They had long since expected this, and had thus planted a great many elites at the foot of the mountains to snipe disciples such as Luo Xing.

“Die!” Luo Xing exclaimed darkly.

Ji Xueming nodded. “Junior Sister Li, Senior Brother Luo and I will hold these people back later. You break through with all your power and ascend the mountains. As long as Master gets the news, he will definitely descend the mountains to save us!”

If they called out for help here, it would be too far a distance. There was no way that they would be able to get any reinforcements. Otherwise, the enemies would not have intercepted them here.

Li Juan looked hesitant, but still nodded. “Senior Brothers, you guys have to take care of yourselves.”

“Charge!” Luo Xing bellowed loudly. Li Juan immediately charged out, but a flash of sword light swept out, and directly sank into the back of Li Juan’s head.

No one had expected this scene, and Li Juan had never imagined that an attack would come towards her from her rear. Her whole mind was focused on breaking through the blockade, so she had been caught completely off guard. Instantly, the attack landed on her full-on.?Pa, she collapsed, blood seeping all over the ground.

Who had done this?

Everyone turned to look towards Ji Xueming, and saw this man suddenly break out into a strange-looking, chilling grin.

“Ji Xueming, you’re mad!” Luo Xing roared in fury. It was Ji Xueming who had delivered this sword strike.

“I’m mad?” Ji Xueming laughed loudly. Suddenly, he made an extremely strange hand gesture.

When the members of the Red Flower Sect saw this, they all couldn’t help but feel stunned. They had not recovered their wits from seeing the scene of fellow members of the same sect kill each other, and when they saw Ji Xueming’s hand gesture, they were even more surprised. Hurriedly, they all bowed. “Greetings, Young Sect Master!”

“What?!” Luo Xing felt a chill come over his whole body. This junior brother of his… was actually a member of the Red Flower Sect!

Ji Xueming broke into a smile. “Before joining the Duplicate Moon Sect, I was already the young sect master of the Red Flower Sect, but Master has never brought me back to the sect, so this matter is known to no one.”

Luo Xing’s eyes turned, and he thought of another possibility. He couldn’t help but become even more angered. “You were also the one who poisoned Missus!”

His tone was one of affirmation because this matter had always seemed strange. Their missus never usually descended the mountains, so how else would she have gotten poisoned?

Thus, if it was the action of one of their own, it could explain everything.

Ji Xueming smiled slightly. “That’s right. It was me.”

Luo Xing trembled. The Red Flower Sect had really invested very much into this scheme because Ji Xueming had joined the sect 30 million years ago!

In other words, this scheme had already been planned and put into action over 30 million years ago. When Ji Xueming finally entered into the threshold, and won the full trust of the Azure Sun Celestial King, the truth would finally be revealed.

Too frightening; this was too frightening!

“Thus, strictly speaking, I am no traitor, right?” Ji Xueming said, his expression calm. Now, it was 11 against one. Oh, right, there was Ling Han as well, but he was only in the Hidden Radiance Stage, so he was completely insignificant.

Ji Xueming’s chances of victory were assured. He only had to get rid of Luo Xing, and he would be completely capable of striding boldly back into the Duplicate Moon Sect. As for the deaths of Li Juan and Luo Xing, he would find some excuse to explain the matter.

Luo Xing was in despair. Ji Xueming, having revealed his true identity, would naturally have complete confidence that he could get rid of Luo Xing, and ensure that the secret would not be leaked.

He was done for, and with a traitor like Ji Xueming there, the Duplicate Moon Sect would soon collapse as well.

“Hahaha!” Luo Xing laughed tragically, tears of blood streaming from his eyes. He drew a long saber, his fighting spirit soaring. “Only death will end this battle. Who will come to their death? Even if I die, there will be another who will die with me!”

Yet Ji Xueming shook his head. “Senior Brother Luo, you seem to be a little dull-witted. Could it be that you still do not know my personality? Since I have moved… would I leave you any room to struggle?”

Luo Xing’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly inspected himself. He couldn’t help but become extremely furious. “You actually poisoned me!”

“Hahahaha, the best strategy is to deal with your enemies without any need for battle.” Ji Xueming laughed. “On the basis that we once were comrades of the same sect, let me send you off on your last trip!”

He was just about to take a step forward when his body involuntarily shuddered as he revealed a hint of shock—Li Juan, who should have died earlier on, had suddenly stood back up.

He had to be seeing things!
