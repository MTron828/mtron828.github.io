Chapter 2371: A shocking turn of events

However, a sliver of divine sense was only just that. When this sliver of divine sense was completely exhausted, the battle prowess of the Black Tower would also fall.

After all, a Heavenly Venerate Tool was still forged by a Heavenly Venerate, so the strongest was still the Heavenly Venerate.

A figure walked out of the Black Tower. It could clearly be distinguished that this was not a real person, but rather a shadowy image that had been formed from countless points of light.

“Yuan Sheng!” Shang Zhiwei wept. To think that she could still see the man that she had yearned for day and night after being separated for eight epochs… She was practically mad with excitement.

Meanwhile, the large black dog was barking loudly, and was also howling at the skies.

“Sealed Emotion, you are right. I have indeed long since died, and have only left behind a sliver of my divine sense in the Tower of Three Realms. Once it is activated, it will disperse very soon,” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable stated calmly. “However, the two of you have made one miscalculation.”

“What?” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate asked, his voice thundering. It was like the exercise of might from an emperor.

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable pointed at the skies, and then grabbed the Black Tower.?Xiu, he actually shot rapidly towards the skies.

What did this mean? He had appeared with only such great difficulty, and actually did not make his move before this sliver of divine sense was completely burnt out, but rather raced towards the skies?

Crack!

In the skies, dark clouds spread out, and lightning flashed in their depths.

“En?”

“Yi?”

“Ya!”

The three great Heavenly Venerates, Sealed Emotion, Jiuwu, and Wu Le, all exclaimed in surprise. Abruptly, they realized that the power of heaven and earth was roaring, and turning into multiple dragons that surged forth from all directions.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Visible to the naked eye, 16-colored Divine Dragons flew out from the ground, winding and twisting in the skies.

The three great Heavenly Venerates were baffled. How could the power of heaven and earth actually manifest? This was illogical because the greatest taboo of the heaven and earth was that someone could grasp this essence power, and escape its control.

Xiu, a Divine Dragon suddenly surged towards Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, and sank into his body with a flash.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was surprised. Heavenly Venerates were not doted sons of the heaven and earth, but rather abandoned children. The power of heaven and earth was not bestowed by the heaven and earth, but rather something he had stolen from the heaven and earth. Previously, he had been severely injured, and could not contend with the heaven and earth. Thus, he had been unable to further extract the power of heaven and earth. Not only did his battle prowess drop greatly, his injuries could not be healed, either. They would only become more severe, and he would finally be killed by the heaven and earth.

But now? The power of heaven and earth was actually actively entering into his body. This was too inconceivable.

‘Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, it must have something to do with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. Otherwise, this would be too much of a coincidence.’

“My wish is that all life would be akin to dragons!” The voice of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable rang out from the skies. The tribulation clouds evolved, and the image of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable actually appeared. The aura he exuded was majestic and boundless, far surpassing the level of any First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Both Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable were greatly shocked. Could it be that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had not died, and had instead become even stronger? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Hang on!”

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable immediately shook his head, and raised his head to look at the skies. “Eight epochs ago, you have already fused yourself with Heavenly Dao. Both your body and spirit have already been assimilated into the heaven and earth, but a sliver of divine sense was still left behind. Though I cannot guess the exact details of the situation, there is no way that you can influence the actions of Heavenly Dao. It is only now that you can forcefully interfere with the realm using the divine sense in the Heavenly Venerate Tool as a stimulus!”

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable smiled faintly. “That’s right. As all life channels, it has its own rhyme and reason. I have already fused with Heavenly Dao, and cannot interfere in the matters of this realm. However, it would only be a small token for me to make it so that the two of you would be further targeted by the power of heaven and earth.”

He pointed a finger, and even more 16-colored Divine Dragons surged into Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s body. Visible to the naked eye, the aura of the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was presently rapidly strengthening, and his injuries were also quickly healing.

“Damn it!” Both Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate humphed lowly. If things went on this way, it would really be possible for Heavenly Venerate Wu Le to recover completely.

They moved, but with a point of the finger from the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable,?boom, two terrifying bolts of lighting struck out at the two great Heavenly Venerates respectively, forcing them to stop.

It was because these bolts of lightning had far surpassed the standards of Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, and had instead reached the level of First Tier Heavenly Venerate. In fact, even among First Tier Heavenly Venerates, they could be considered extremely terrifying.

This was a warning from the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. His words did not hold a single lie, and he could really make it that the heaven and earth would target them even more strongly.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le took in deep breaths. The 16-colored Divine Dragons surged into his body endlessly, and his body was becoming more and more complete. His aura was also as vast as an ocean. It was like just opening his eyes could cause countless stars to fall from the skies.

He had just about recovered to his strongest condition.

Both Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable were shocked and furious. Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable definitely only had a limited amount of time and extent in which he could influence the heaven and earth, and this was because of that sliver of divine sense that he had left behind in the Tower of Three Realms.

Once this sliver of divine sense dispersed, he would only be assimilated by Heavenly Dao. Perhaps, he would still be able to see and hear, but there would be no way for him to interfere.

No matter how strong a Heavenly Venerate was, how could they possibly compare with heaven and earth itself?

But it was precisely this limited amount of time for him to show his might, and the two great Heavenly Venerates were completely helpless.

If they wanted to oppose the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, they could, and that was by similarly fusing themselves with Heavenly Dao. Then, they would all be able to battle within Heavenly Dao.

But what meaning was there to this? To fuse themselves with Heavenly Dao meant that they would no longer exist. Then, even if they defeated the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, so what?

“Hahahaha!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed loudly. His injuries had already completely recovered, and he had returned to his strongest state.

Even the heaven and earth was helping him cheat, so how could it not be awesome?

“Come fight me again!” He pounced aggressively, challenging the two great Heavenly Venerates simultaneously.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two great Heavenly Venerates were forced to face the battle. This time, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had not influenced the heaven and earth to deliberately target the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate. But Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s battle prowess was unexpectedly great. Even in a battle of one against two, he was actually not at the slightest disadvantage.

“You…” Both Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate were astonished.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le grinned proudly. With them all being able to become a Heavenly Venerate, who would be weaker than the other?

Though it was Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity that was refining him, in this process, he had also spied on the former’s Dao. That was over a dozen epochs, and the two Heavenly Venerates were both studying each other’s Dao, and contending with each other, traversing the edge of danger—whoever was the slightest bit careless would be refined by the other.

Hence, while Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was powerful, with Vitality Index that was close to 16,000, that was actually the same for Heavenly Venerate Wu Le as well. However, as he was in the realm of the Foreign Realm, and could not get any replenishment of power of heaven and earth from the Celestial Realm, he had become weaker and weaker, but once he returned to his prime condition, his battle prowess would be much too terrifying.

…His Vitality Index was also close to 16,000. Otherwise, how would he have managed to stand against the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity?

Everyone’s eyes were glazed over. Who would have thought that not only had Heavenly Venerate Wu Le been dragged back from the brink of death, he had become as powerful as this at that? Even in a battle of two against one, he was still undefeated.

“Yuan Sheng!” In the distance, Shang Zhiwei murmured to the skies.

Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable looked towards her, and revealed an apologetic smile. “Zhiwei, it was I who had let you down. In the future, let go of your grudges, and continue living well.”

“No, I want to be with you!” Shang Zhiwei shook her head, her tone determined and stubborn. Step after step, she walked onwards, and as she walked, her body was also burning. She was actually going to disperse herself and return to the heaven and earth.

“Master!” An Ran exclaimed, and wanted to pull Shang Zhiwei back, yet the latter waved a palm lightly at her, and she was swept onto the ground.

“I know you must hate me for killing Yi Yun. Now, I shall give my life back to her. I want to be with you forever!” Shang Zhiwei burned herself, turning herself into Regulations that were compatible with the heaven and earth.

Everyone could not help but feel touched.
