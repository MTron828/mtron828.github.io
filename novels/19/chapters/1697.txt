Chapter 1698: The Empress moves, 92 holes!

Yuan Xingping was dressed in black, and there were multiple rows of golden silk on the fabric. Upon closer look, patterns would be flickering on them occasionally.

This was a treasured armor, but whether it was meant for strengthening attack or defense was unknown.

He was incredibly handsome, his hair black and shiny, and his complexion glowing like jade. His appearance was the type that even other men would feel their hearts beat faster when they looked at him, an extremely beautiful man that other men would want to make bent.

But that was Yuan Xingping. Even those who preferred their own gender would not dare show their interest in him.

Yuan Xingping walked over as if he was strolling, walking very slowly and casually over. Even if there were more than 1,000 pairs of eyes fixed on him, he was still unhurried and relaxed, his art of composure control very well-practiced.

Everyone did not have the slightest feeling of wanting to hurry him, either. This young man’s aura was too astonishing. It was like he was an emperor who had ventured out; who would dare rush him?

Finally, he had arrived in front of the holed pillar and stopped.

Faced with this young king tier that had risen up aggressively, even that red-haired young man appeared very reverent. He took the initiative to greet him first, and said, “Greetings, Brother Yuan.”

Yuan Xingping only nodded slightly. There was no need for him to take the other man seriously at all, but this red-haired young man presently represented Changsun Liang, so he still had to give him some face. He looked at that holed pillar, and then casually threw out a punch.

Weng, the stone pillar shook strongly, and then as many as nine rows of holes lit up.

82!

“As expected of Yuan Xingping, too strong!”

“Finally someone has reached more than 80 holes.”

“No wonder Yuan Xingping managed to bring Double Extreme City to become the champion single-handedly; this really is boundless strength.”

Everyone exclaimed in admiration. Though they were all in a competitive relationship, cultivators had always respected strength, and Yuan Xingping was indeed deserving of their admiration.

Yuan Xingping wrinkled his brow slightly. He hesitated for a moment, and did not make another attempt.

This made everyone feel curious. Some guessed that he was deliberately preserving his strength, but there were also those who said that even if he tried his best, he might not reach more than 90 holes, so it would be better to quit while he was ahead, leaving a hint of mystery to his persona.

After Yuan Xingping, a few more prodigies appeared, but they all achieved only 70-odd holes, and he was still the only one who had reached 80 holes and above.

“Ling Han, go!” Mao Shuyu and the others had begun to egg Ling Han on again, but things were really very coincidental. At this moment, another commotion broke out among the masses.

Dan Yujing had come!

In the recent hundred years, she had emerged as a new force to be reckoned with, like a shooting star streaking across the skies, leaving behind dazzling accomplishments. Who knew how many excellent Saint Kings had been defeated by her. And she was also known as the only person who could make Yuan Xingping go all out in this competition.

Her white skirts fluttered, her black locks cascading down like a waterfall. Her beauty was elegant and refined, and a great many people who had not seen her before had immediately fallen in love with her at first sight.

“Fairy Dan.” The red-haired young man again took the initiative to greet her. In this round of elites, only these two people were worthy of his serious regard because Changsun Liang had said, “These two people are quite interesting.”

Since Lord Holy Son had said thus, he naturally dared not slight them, either.

Dan Yujing also gave the other face, and nodded slightly in reply. Then, she looked at the holed pillar, and suddenly delivered a palm strike. Weng, her slender hand was as fair as jade, and looked incredibly pleasing to the eye, but one only had to see the patterns of great dao that had condensed beneath her palm, and there would definitely be no one who dared to have any inappropriate ideas about her.

Weng, her palm landed, and majestic light immediately surged out of the holed pillar. It was practically blinding to the eye, and then row after row of holes shone.

<ol start=”84″>

Even better than Yuan Xingping’s result, but she had clearly built up power. Though this might not be her strongest performance still, if one were to judge that she was stronger than Yuan Xingping with just this, it would definitely be very unjust.

“Ling Han, go on!” Mao Shuyu and the others were egging on Ling Han for the third time, hoping that no one would cut in the line this time round.

Indeed, no outsiders cut into the line, but the Empress stood up first. Today, she was dressed in a red skirt of silk. Previously, Ling Han had kept her in his arms, and now that she had walked out, her tall, slender figure immediately drew the attention of others.

The Empress strode forwards, exuding the unique air of dignity that belonged to a king tier, and others wanted nothing more than to kneel beneath her feet, and surrender their petty and low souls to her.

That red-haired young man, too, stood up involuntarily. He did not know why he had done so himself, and when he had suddenly come back to his senses, he was already standing respectfully with bowed head, as if he was facing the Holy Son Changsun Liang himself.

The Empress naturally would not take it to heart. There was no significance whether others respected her or otherwise. She stretched out her unadorned hand, and pressed down lightly on the holed pillar. It was a flawless jade-like hand, and others would salivate at how beautiful it was.

This blow was incredibly ordinary, and there was no frightening aura surging out, nor was there any flickering of great dao. It was like she was simply greeting someone.

Pa, her palm pressed down on the holed pillar. It was very light, but the holed pillar still shook slightly, and row after row of holes lit up consecutively.

10 rows!

The first nine rows had lit up completely, while two holes on the 10th row had lit up.

92 holes!

At this moment, everyone was dumbfounded, their eyes open wide and their heads completely numb, even feeling suffocated.

A light strike, and as a result 92 holes had lit up!

This definitely was a light palm strike; if she had tried her best, Regulations of great dao would definitely have appeared.

And such a strike was enough to light up 92 holes, so how powerful would she be if she tried her best?

99 holes... 100 holes?

Heavens, this was an absolute king tier that was not the slightest bit inferior to Changsun Liang!

The Empress did not make another attempt. She only wanted to know what estimated level her strength was capable of reaching, and that was enough.

Ling Han broke into a slight smile. After the Empress broke through to the Saint King Tier, her battle prowess had indeed improved further. Otherwise, even if she had tried her best, she would probably only have managed to light up 90 holes. But now? 99 holes should not be her limit.

“Dare I ask the esteemed name of this celestial maiden?” The red-haired young man appeared to be even more respectful.

“Luan Xing,” the Empress answered calmly, walking towards Ling Han.

It was clear that the red-haired young man wanted to find out even more information, and took a step forward, just about to speak further, when the Empress directed a glare at him. He immediately stepped backwards.

Meanwhile, Ling Han smilingly asked, “May I ask if one can bring their family members if they go to Celestial Clouds Island?”

The red-haired young man was distracted. Only after a while did he nod his head, and answered, “Yes, but one can only bring a single friend with them at most.”

Ling Han smiled at the Empress, and said, “Wife, then I will have to bask in your glory this time.”

The Empress also smiled, though it was unfortunate that no one could see her unmatched beauty.

Seeing this scene, the people in the area wanted nothing more than to beat Ling Han to death.

‘You deadbeat, aren’t you ashamed of yourself!’

Ling Han wrapped his arm around the Empress’s slender waist, and glared demonstratively at the others. He was showing off—even if you guys were defiant, what could you do?

“Fairy, please wait!” Yuan Xingping walked over, and said, “I recently gained a celestial technique, and it is said to have been passed down from a Dividing Soul Tier elite. Does Fairy have any interest in studying it with me?”

Hiss, a Dividing Soul Tier-level celestial technique! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone was both stunned and rueful. Yuan Xingping was really nature-defying, actually managing to obtain a celestial technique of this level. Yet now, he was willing to take it out to study it with another, showing that he had definitely fallen in love at first sight with the Empress.

She had not even shown her true face, and a prodigy was already enchanted by her to this extent?

However, the others did not feel that this was anything strange at all. If it was them that had a supreme celestial technique, they would also be willing to take it out and share it with the Empress.

Being able to develop a close relationship with the Empress, whatever price they had to pay would be worth it.
