Chapter 1694: Fierce and uncivilized siblings

Ling Han and the Empress walked around casually in the secondary city, finding out some information regarding Black Moon City.

In truth, it was not easy to enter into a Two Star City and above; it was not something that could be done just by paying an entrance fee... Of course, the entrance fee into the city still had to be paid, but one would also need a special reason. For example, if you were a resident of the city, or if you had been invited. Want to enter into the city as you like? No way.

Even traders could not possibly enter Black Moon City, and could only hand over their goods in the secondary city.

It was rumored that the cultivation environment in Black Moon City was 10 times better than the Dark Moon City’s!

If they opened their doors wide, then even if Black Moon City was incredibly gigantic, it would definitely be flooded with people. However, this kind of restriction also had another purpose, and that was to show the lofty position of a Two Star City.

If everyone could simply enter the Imperial Palace as they liked, then what prestige would be left?

The Celestial Realm had Immortal Substance. As long as one entered the Severing Mundane Tier, and managed to survive the Immortal’s Tribulation repeatedly, they would theoretically possess an endless lifespan. And in truth, this was greatly beneficial to every single person.

Because they were breathing in Immortal Substance constantly, it was preserved inside their bodies, and every person’s lifespan would be greatly higher than that of the living beings of the Ancient Realm. Here, even a person who had never cultivated before could live five to six centuries, and Genesis Tiers were even able to reach five or six billion years old.

Black Moon City had a giant formation to gather the Spiritual Qi and Immortal Substance from the surroundings, and if one resided in the city for an extended period, their rate of advancement in cultivation would not only be swift, their lifespan would also be longer.

Wasn’t the reason why cultivators cultivated precisely to snatch more years of life from the heavens?

These reasons added together made a Two Star City something that everyone would scramble madly for, and even a rich kid like Ding Xiaochen wanted to squeeze in at all costs.

And this was only a Two Star City, so what about a Three Star City? A Four Star City? A Five Star City?

After they had walked around enough, Ling Han and the Empress headed back to their inn. Yet they were only halfway there when an aggressive woman stood in their way.

“So you were the ones who beat my brother?” This woman’s killing intent was blazing. She was extremely enchanting in appearance, and could be considered a top beauty. Of course, she was no match for the Empress.

“Sister, they were the ones who beat me!” There was a badly battered young man standing beside her, pointing angrily at Ling Han and the Empress. It was the guy who had wanted to take liberties with the Empress previously, yet was sent flying with a single slap from her.

This pair of siblings was quite interesting, speaking in concert with each other.

The woman humphed, and declared, “Each of you break your arm and kowtow to my brother in my apology, and I can spare your lives.”

“Sister, I want that woman!” The young man pointed at the Empress. Though he had not seen the Empress’s true features, just by looking at the Empress’s captivating figure, his heart burned with fire, and he was determined to possess her.

An indulgent expression flashed over the woman’s face, and she nodded, and replied, “All right, all right, whatever Bao’er wants!” She turned to look at Ling Han and the Empress again, and frowned. “What are you two waiting for?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head, and asked, “Are the two of you retards? Retards are nothing to fear, but if you run around despite knowing the fact that you are retards, that would be your fault.”

“What a wicked mouth!” the woman rebuked, and delivered a slap towards Ling Han. “In front of me, Liu Muyu, what right do you two have to be arrogant?”

Ling Han delivered a casual strike, and easily resolved this blow from Liu Muyu. He calmly said, “Without asking for reason, you are immediately finding fault, and even want to break our arms, and make us kowtow and apologize. How ridiculous.

“If this was merely being arrogant, then what when your brother wants to take my wife by force, and you actually agree? This has really refreshed my perception of people.”

He broke into a grin, and said, “I have decided to capture you and simply hand you over to any single man as his wife so you can also have a taste of that experience. Furthermore, it will also solve the life problem of a single man.”

“How dare you??” Liu Muyu sneered, and struck out another palm. This time, her attack was filled with anger, so her power was considerably greater than before. The force of her strike turned into a crescent blade that was entwined with Regulations of great dao. Multiple patterns dazzled the skies, and was very frightening.

This woman was really reckless. Even if the structures in the Celestial Realm were sturdy, the full-power attack of a Genesis Tier would still cause massive damage. She did not care that this was a street in a busy marketplace at all, and attacked just because she wanted to.

Ling Han’s expression cooled. Using Lightning Flash, he had already suddenly appeared in front of Liu Muyu. Pa

, he had delivered a slap. He did not feel that his anger was vented enough with just one slap, and threw another slap with the back of his hand. Pa.

After these two slaps landed, Liu Muyu’s exquisite face was instantly swollen, and her hair was disheveled. What beauty did she have left? All that was left was malevolence. She glared viciously at Ling Han, and a majestic light flickered in her hands. She had summoned a precious sword.

This was really a previous sword. The sword’s blade was covered densely with patterns of great dao, as if it was the sword of an emperor, exuding an endless aura of dignity.

Even Ling Han was slightly moved. This definitely was no ordinary Saint King Tier weapon. Its power definitely surpassed that standard, but it seemed to still be very far from Severing Mundane Tier. It seemed to have been tempered by a Severing Mundane Ancestor, but had not truly ascended to the level of Severing Mundane Tier.

It should have been forged from Half Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, so even if there was a Severing Mundane Ancestor involved, it was still unable to attain the level of the first severance.

“Die!” Liu Muyu brandished the sword and struck at Ling Han. The Sword Qi was biting cold, like great dao itself was in a rage. Multiple flashes of Sword Qi were all formed from patterns of great dao. This destructive power was definitely terrifying.

Ling Han did not dare be careless. He had not defended against this kind of precious Tool before. Immediately, he clenched his hands into fists, and struck back at the Sword Qi. His present physique had also reached the extent of Half Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, so he did not fear a head-on clash like this.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The force of his punches clashed with the Sword Qi, and it would result in a blinding flash every time, as if the heavens and earth were being split apart.

After only a few moves, Ling Han had free rein. If the power of this Divine Sword could be unleashed fully, then it would definitely be capable of contending against him. What was unfortunate was that a Tool was only a Tool, after all, so how could it be any match for a human?

He advanced aggressively, and easily took this sword from his opponent’s hands by force. He put it away casually, then sealed the opponent’s cultivation level, and picked her up.

The young man wanted to run, but Ling Han caught up with him in a single step, and similarly picked him up.

After Liu Muyu herself had been captured, she still maintained her fierce manner, and was still making threatening gestures, but when she saw that the young man was captured, she had turned pale in fear, and shrilly screamed, “Let go of my brother! If you dare touch a single hair on his head, I will kill you! I swear, I will definitely kill you!”

Ling Han shook his hand, and a series of cracks rang out. At least one-third of all the bones in Liu Bao’s body had been shattered from the force. He looked at that young man again, and the latter turned pale in fear. He could not help but begin to shiver, and the seat of his pants was wet. He had actually peed himself in fear.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” The young man wailed.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Don’t worry, I am not a butcher, so I do not know how to kill pigs. But for someone who likes to humiliate women so much, I will let you have a taste of the same experience.”

When they had strolled around just now, he had seen a brothel that catered deliberately for men that had unique tastes. It was filled with “gorgeously dressed” men!

As for Liu Muyu, just like how he had said previously, she would be sent to a single man.
