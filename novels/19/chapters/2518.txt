Chapter 2519: Second Level

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A’mu was a supreme prodigy for the ages. He was ranked seventh on the stone tablet.

However, this was only the ranking list for the second level of the Nine Deaths Formation, so it didn’t signify that he was the seventh strongest out of all those who had passed this formation before. Even so, such a high ranking was a reflection of his freakish abilities.

Ling Han was more curious about why Wally wasn’t ranked among the top few people.

Oh, right. Even though his analysis ability was number one in the world, peerless among all people, engaging in fights wasn’t his strong suit.

Thus, passing levels that pertained to calculations and analysis would be extremely easy for Wally. However, if he needed to battle, he would need to exert much more effort.

Ling Han looked further down. In eighth place was Du Shiyi, another supreme prodigy of the current generation.

In ninth place was… Heavenborn! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With Heavenborn’s ability, he only managed to rank ninth?

It could be said that Heavenborn was the culmination and embodiment of an entire dimension’s essence. Thus, he would be no less freakish than Wally. No, he was most likely even more freakish than Wally. After all, the latter had still been created by humans. Meanwhile, Heavenborn was formed by the Celestial Realm itself.

Where had Heavenborn been inferior? Was it in battle, or was it in analysis and predictions?

Ling Han believed that it was the latter. After all, in terms of battle, Heavenborn’s physique was far too powerful. His body was equivalent to Divine Metal, so it wouldn’t be difficult for him to challenge all nine levels of the Nine Deaths Formation. Even if he couldn’t defeat his opponents, he could still flee with ease.

Thus, he had definitely been beaten in terms of analytical ability.

Even so, the fact that he had made it onto the Eternal Stone proved that his abilities had surpassed those of the countless people before him. However, there were still those who could suppress him. Moreover, some of them belonged to the same generation. In other words, Heavenborn was still slightly inferior in this area.

......

Even though he was nurtured and born by heaven and earth, there were still limits to his abilities.

Ling Han nodded in his mind. He became even more confident that he could defeat Heavenborn.

This was certainly not an invincible and insurmountable opponent.

Ling Han continued to look down. In 10th place was Huo Furong. This was as expected of the number one Celestial Maiden of the ages. Even here, she was still as impressive as always.

Looking further down, Ji Wuming was ranked 29th, while the Rain Emperor was ranked 79th. Even though this seemed low, one had to realize that being able to make it onto the Eternal Stone was already an impressive feat in itself.

‘Where’s the Empress and Hu Niu?

‘Were they not powerful enough, or was it because of some other reason?’

Ling Han felt like both explanations were possible. Even though the Empress and Hu Niu were also monarch stars, their Evolution Indices had only been around 10. It wasn’t all that high. In this academy, however, there were freaks who possessed Evolution Indices of close to 12.

Trying to surpass these freaks would naturally be a challenge. Moreover, with the Empress’ proud nature, perhaps she would find it beneath her to compete with others anyway. Hu Niu was more so unreliable when it came to these matters. It was entirely possible that she was uninterested in these rankings.

He swept his gaze around. However, before he could even look toward the second stone tablet, several people walked out from the academy gates.

‘Heavenborn!’

His pupils instantly contracted. The person in the lead was none other than Heavenborn. There were already five ribbons of iridescent light around him, and he was like a revered leader surrounded by underlings as a dozen or so people followed behind him. Each of them was a Celestial King, surrounded by one to five ribbons of iridescent light.

“Lord Heavenborn is going to challenge the Nine Deaths Formation again!”

“This time, perhaps Lord Heavenborn will break Lord Du’s record!”

The Celestial Kings conversed among themselves as they walked, completely ignoring Ling Han and the middle-aged man. Perhaps they simply viewed them as a Celestial King with his follower.

As always, Heavenborn possessed a formidable aura. It was as if his body contained a primordial beast, with each of his steps causing the earth to shudder.

He entered from the location of the fourth stone tablet, with his body immediately vanishing without a trace.

Here, each stone tablet rested in front of the corresponding level of the Nine Deaths Formation. For example, the first stone tablet corresponded to the second level of the Nine Deaths Formation. Meanwhile, the fourth stone tablet corresponded to the fifth level of the Nine Deaths Formation.

Right now, Heavenborn was already a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, so he was also going to challenge the fifth level of the formation. He didn’t plan to improve his results in the previous levels.

Ling Han swept his gaze over the remaining stone tablets. The names on these tablets were quite different. For example, Lin Xiaoyang’s name was nowhere to be seen. However, with the ability to become a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, would he not have the ability to leave his name on these stone tablets?

It was clear that he hadn’t wasted any of his time or effort here. Or perhaps he had left his name here before, yet he had erased it afterward for one reason or another.

Meanwhile, Heavenborn’s name appeared on each of the first four tablets. On the first three stone tablets, he was ranked from ninth to 10th on each one. On the fourth stone tablet, however, he was only ranked 19th.

Was this because Heavenborn’s power suddenly became insufficient?

This was naturally not the case. This was because Du Shiyi was only ranked 18th, while A’mu was only ranked 17th.

Ling Han pondered over the possible reasons. For example, it would definitely be extremely easy for him to pass the second level of the Nine Deaths Formation. This was because his true battle prowess had already reached the Fifth Heaven. This was a crushing advantage.

In this sense, his results would naturally be better than if his battle prowess were only at the Second Heaven. This was without a doubt.

This was most likely the same situation for Heavenborn. For the first three levels, he had passed them by relying on the crushing advantage of his cultivation level. However, upon reaching the fifth level, he would no longer enjoy an advantage in terms of cultivation level. Thus, his results naturally declined.

In some sense, Heavenborn’s battle prowess while at the Fifth Heaven could only be ranked 19th out of everyone in history. Moreover, this was only among those who had decided to earnestly challenge this formation. Perhaps there were some prodigies who kept an extremely low profile, and didn’t try to create any records at all?

For example, Lin Luo. He was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, yet his name didn’t appear on any of the stone tablets. The same could be said for Zhou Heng and Chu Hao.

Ling Han looked at the middle-aged man with a smile, and said, “I still haven’t asked for your esteemed name.”

“Ouyang Ming,” the middle-aged man replied with a smile.

Ling Han looked at the first stone tablet, and said, “Please wait for a moment. I also want to try my hand at this formation.”

“Please go ahead,” Ouyang Ming said, gesturing in invitation. He was also extremely curious about how prodigious Ling Han was. This would also dictate how he treated him in the future.

Ling Han entered the Nine Deaths Formation from the location of the first stone tablet. His surroundings didn’t appear to change at all. However, after taking a few steps, a wooden puppet suddenly appeared before him. This was identical to the situation in the first level.

Boom!

The wooden puppet immediately charged over, throwing a punch. Symbols lit up, and it was clear that it had a battle prowess at the peak stage of the Second Heaven.

This was the second level of the formation, so all of the challenges were designed with Second Heaven Celestial Kings in mind.

Ling Han attacked, easily defeating his opponent. After several more battles, he appeared before an expanse of fog.

Sure enough, this was identical to the first level. The only difference was that the opponents were more powerful.

He entered the fog, immediately inviting attacks from powerful enemies. Their battle prowess was slightly stronger, and perhaps even ordinary emperor tiers would be unable to rival them.

Ling Han advanced with confidence. These opponents were merely small fry to him. After a short while, he arrived before a city that sat between two towering mountains.

This was again identical to the first level. He had to rearrange these shards into words.

He looked toward the city gates.

Boom!

Countless shards surged into his mind, greater in number and more chaotic in manner.

Sure enough, it was much more difficult than before.

Like before, Ling Han first separated these shards into groups. After sorting them into over 40 groups, he then rearranged them all at once.

After 15 or so minutes, he suddenly opened his eyes. Numerous complete symbols pulsated in his eyes.

This time, it wasn’t words that had been formed. Instead, these were symbols of the great dao.

This was extremely mysterious. Symbols of the great dao could actually be used like this?

Whoosh!

He was swept into the city.

However, the symbols of the great dao didn’t vanish. At this moment, Ling Han suddenly started to hesitate. Should he continue to advance, or should he stop to investigate these symbols? He had a feeling that these symbols were extraordinary.

After a brief moment of hesitation, Ling Han eventually decided to sit down.

Compared to strength, mere reputation was worth nothing!
