Chapter 2129: Intervention of a powerful figure

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han broke into a smile. “Sorry!” He waved his hand again, and?peng, that person from Four Seas Palace was sent flying with a strike, shooting through the air like a kite that had its line cut, and drawing out an elegant arc before finally dropping.

He had not been too heavy-handed. Thus, that person soon scrambled back to his feet, his expression completely gobsmacked.

“You depraved villain, what are you trying to do?” the woman that he had grabbed exclaimed loudly.

This man had already injured his companion just to grab hold of her. Then, what kind of beastly acts did he plan to do to her?

“Don’t worry. With your looks, you are very safe. I won’t do anything to you,” Ling Han said carelessly, and then broke out into a mad run.

That Immortal Palace Tier elite had been keeping an eye on him all this while, and now that he had suddenly “turned traitor”, he naturally would fly into a thunderous rage and make a move.

As expected, that elite was just about to throw off his own opponent, and make a move on Ling Han. But the Roc Palace elite’s strength was extraordinary as well, keeping him entangled tightly in battle, leaving him no means of escape.

“Humph!” The elite smirked coldly. Did he think that he could not do anything like this?

He got a hand free, and tapped out a finger towards Ling Han.

“Ultimate Celestial Tap!” he stated softly.

Xiu, a streak of light shot rapidly towards Ling Han. This was a celestial technique that had been delivered from an Immortal Palace Tier. it was definitely capable of insta-killing any Dividing Soul Tier.

Naturally, the Roc Palace elite that was fighting him could not possibly rescue an enemy. In any case, it was just a case of internal strife on the enemy side, so what did it have to do with her? She only sped up her attack, wanting to kill this powerful foe.

Weng, a streak of light approached. This was the attack of an Immortal Palace Tier. Even if it was not a full-powered blow, it was definitely not anything that a Dividing Soul Tier could withstand.

This light was like a fierce wave of obliteration.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han raised his hand and tossed the Roc Palace woman in his hands away, taking this attack on alone.

Boom, a terrifying celestial light surged past. To a Dividing Soul Tier, this was definitely fatal, and instantly submerged Ling Han within its light.

The Roc Palace woman couldn’t help but be dumbfounded with shock. In this kind of a situation, Ling Han had still thrown her away, and would rather die alone.

What kind of true affection was this?

Could it be that this was true love? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She had not even finished the thought when the celestial light dispersed. Ling Han was standing there, completely unscathed, and merely a trace of blood was left at the corner of his lips.

H-he didn’t die?

Involuntarily, she was shocked. That was the blow of an Immortal Palace Tier, but Ling Han actually just bled a little from the corners of his mouth. What kind of frightening defense was this?

Ling Han rubbed the corners of his lips. Just now, he had taken the initiative to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, further improving the strength of his physique greatly. Even an Immortal Palace Tier could not possibly kill him with a single blow. However, Immortal Palace Tier was still Immortal Palace Tier, after all. Ling Han was still in great pain all over his body, his organs practically close to exploding and shooting out from his body.

As he saw it, this was very natural. In the first place, his physique was capable of ignoring any Heaven Soul-level attack, so if he further channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he would be able to temporarily further improve his defenses greatly. Thus, wasn’t it very normal that he would be able to block the attack of an Immortal Palace Tier?

However, anyone who witnessed this scene all showed expressions of astonishment, involuntarily stopping their movements.

The impact of this scene was really too great.

“Yi, why has the fighting stopped?” Someone was still brandishing his weapon madly, but no one attacked him even after a long while, causing him to feel completely baffled.

Even Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier elites had noticed, especially Ascending Origin Tier elites. Their divine sense was too sensitive. All this while, this battlefield was grasped in the palms of their hands. If their side lost, they would withdraw their troops as soon as possible to prevent overly excessive losses.

“Interesting,” an Ascending Origin Tier spoke up, and then stretched out a hand suddenly, grabbing out at Ling Han.

This kind of elite was really frightening. His hand had just moved, and it had already appeared in front of Ling Han out of nowhere, grabbing downwards at him.

“Humph!” There was no need for Ling Han to dodge. Yet another large hand struck out, and attacked the first giant hand.

Boom, a third giant hand attacked, and then it was a fourth, then a fifth… It was like Ling Han had suddenly become an ultimate treasure. Everyone wanted to capture him.

Indeed, the fact that a Dividing Soul Tier managed to block the blow of an Immortal Palace Tier was too astonishing. Anyone would feel curious.

“Ling Han!” An incredibly crisp voice rang out, and a figure suddenly shot out from the mountains.

It was Hu Niu.

“Little Mistress, behave yourself.” A large hand stretched out, and grabbed hold of Hu Niu, forcibly pulling her back. However, very quickly afterwards, this large hand extended once more, and appeared directly in front of Ling Han, completely ignoring all laws of space.

“Long Yuexi, aren’t you dead yet?” A soft exclamation sounded, and another large hand appeared, arriving in a sweep.

Compared to the first giant hand that was wrinkled all over, the second giant hand was much better-looking, smooth as jade and shining with a soft luster. While it looked delicate, it had a kind of nobility and grace in its delicate appearance.

Pa!

The two giant hands crashed together, and an intense collision immediately erupted in the Regulations of the Great Dao. Endless celestial light filled the heavens, and even those stars in the skies had completely lost their color in this brilliance.

Pa, pa, pa, pa.?Everyone knelt down. Aside from Ling Han, no one could be the exception.

This was a suppression on the level of essence. It was like they were facing the heaven and earth, and did not have the slightest sliver of ability to resist.

A Celestial King had moved!

A massive power rippled out, and Ling Han was instantly tossed flying. The danger of death enshrouded him.

He had a feeling that it was useless even if he could use Rising From The Ashes. This wild storm of energy would extinguish the flames of his revival in the next instant, and strike him completely into death and the Underworld.

Because this was the move of a Celestial King, an existence that was above all others.

He hurriedly used the mystical power of Time of the Black Tower, boosting himself so that his own time could be sped up by 10,000 times, winning him the time to save himself.

But even so, the wild storm of energy that was madly rushing towards him was still overwhelmingly fast.

He hurriedly used the power of the Five Elements Source Powers, forming a defensive shield in front of him. However, this was really only capable of mounting slight resistance. The protective wall immediately crumbled. In front of this storm of energy, it was not capable of even lasting a single blow.

However, this had also finally garnered a sliver of time for him. Ling Han had completely finished the thought, and?xiu, his entire person immediately disappeared without a trace. He had entered the Black Tower.

Boom, in the outside world, wild waves of energy surged madly, spilling out in a completely unbridled manner. Even lower-level Celestial Kings would be terrified at this.

No, no, no. Even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was here, he would still frown slightly.

That was because both sides were too strong, both being overlord existences even among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

…The Imperial Empress of Four Seas Palace, Shang Zhiwei.

…The grand elder of the Roc Palace, Long Yuexi.

After the attack, Shang Zhiwei had already appeared. She had a tall, slender build, and wore white imperial robes. Her glossy hair was piled on the top of her head, appearing poised and noble. And she was also a rare beauty. Compared to the Empress and Hu Niu, she was only slightly inferior in beauty, but added with the domineering air she possessed as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, she definitely was in no way inferior to the two women.

“Long Yuexi, come out here to meet your death!” she demanded coldly.

Long Yuexi paid her no regard at all, and merely calmly stated, “Retreat!”

“Coward!” Shang Zhiwei humphed. The other party had already avoided battle for a good many years, and Shang Zhiwei had already gotten used to it as well.

It could not be helped. The other woman had sustained a dao injury, and being able to live for so many years was already a very good fortune. If Long Yuexi went all out in battle, it was highly possible that the battle would be her last.

“That’s not right!” She was just about to wave her hand to signal for her troops to retreat as well when her eyes suddenly shone brightly, and swept a glance at the spot Ling Han had vanished. “Long Yuexi, you almost had me fooled.. Previously, though you have also avoided battle and hidden, you would not retreat as easily as this without a verbal battle at least. What are you trying to hide?”
