Chapter 2375: Kill again

“I forfeit!” Hong Huang forced out through gritted teeth.

A man could take what came. This time, he was indeed no match for Ling Han.

However, after this, he would ask for the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s help to send him into the Foreign Realm. In any case, they had an agreement with the Foreign Realm, so he would not have to worry about being slaughtered and eaten there. When he, too, fused the Regulations of the two realms, he would return and defeat Ling Han.

Ling Han said nothing further, and merely shot another punch.

“What are you doing?” Hong Huang roared in fury. He had already forfeited the battle.

“Killing you!” Ling Han declared menacingly. Previously, Hong Huang had been extremely overbearing; just because he was the disciple of a Heavenly Venerate, he had acted without any scruples at all in the Saintly Origin Academy, and had repeatedly attacked him even. Did he think he had forgotten it all?

“You dare!!” Hong Huang could only parry with a single arm. At most, he could only unleash 80% of his normal battle prowess, so he was naturally even less of a match for Ling Han.

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Ling Han humphed. He dared to attack even the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, what more a mere Ascending Origin Tier. When he had become a Heavenly Venerate himself, he would obliterate the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable sooner or later. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Some Celestial Kings spoke up to mediate the strife. After all, Hong Huang was a Monarch Star, and would definitely become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future. He would be a pillar of support for the resistance against the invasion of the Foreign Realm.

Ling Han smirked coldly. “I forgot to tell you guys. Sealed Emotion, Jiuwu, and Green Flames have already collaborated with the Foreign Realm, and plan to extract the Source Power of the Celestial Realm when the Celestial Realm is destroyed so that they can realize their own Transcendance. Hence, there is no need to expect anything from anyone of their line. In any case, they will not be sharing the fate of the Celestial Realm.”

‘What?!’

When the Celestial Kings heard this, they all frowned.

Some of them did not believe it, but when they thought carefully about the actions of the three Heavenly Venerates throughout the years, it was indeed as Ling Han said. They had not done anything for the sake of resisting the Foreign Realm.

The matter over a dozen epochs ago was one thing. There was no one here that had lived that long, but eight epochs ago, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had faced off against the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerates on his own, and in the end sacrificed his life to barricade the passageway of the two realms.

There were still many veteran Celestial Kings that had experienced that battle. Furthermore, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had also manifested previously, and this was proof that could not be more obvious.

The three great Heavenly Venerates were completely passive!

As it turned out, they had long since made their decision to destroy the Celestial Realm. The only reason that they had not interfered was because they were too strong, and would be targeted by the heaven and earth. Hence, they required the help of the Foreign Realm to accomplish this in their stead.

No wonder. Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had returned from the Foreign Realm, yet was faced with the assault of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, they were even determined to kill Ling Han because it was extremely possible that the latter would become a Heavenly Venerate in the future.

Whether it was the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le or Ling Han becoming a Heavenly Venerate, as long as they were there, they would definitely be able to stop the invasion of the Foreign Realm, or at least delay it, just like how the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had done, causing a delay for as long as eight epochs.

This was detrimental to the benefits of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and the others, so they naturally wanted to make a move on Heavenly Venerate Wu Le and Ling Han.

Ling Han shot up high, and brandished a fist which he shot straight at Hong Huang’s head.

Hong Huang parried.?Pa, his remaining arm was also completely destroyed. He released a furious roar, but turned around and fled. His opponent was too strong, and there was no way he could be a match.

Ling Han burst forth with frightening physical power, and caught up to him in a single step. In terms of short bursts of power, Body Art naturally far surpassed Regulations. He shot another punch, which landed on Hong Huang’s back.

Peng, Hong Huang’s whole person was beaten until he burst. The power he had put into his defense could not even withstand a single blow.

Ling Han bathed in Hong Huang’s shower of blood, standing proudly in midair.

Though the person he had killed was only an Ascending Origin Tier, Hong Huang was a Monarch Star, and would have definitely become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future, so how much did he weigh?

Even Celestial Kings were speechless, feeling that Ling Han was really on opposing sides with the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable now.

He was outrageously brave and truly completely brazen.

Ling Han broke into a grin. “Everyone, allow me to clean myself up before we go for a drink.”

Mainly, he had to first deal with the human slaves that he had brought back from the Foreign Realm. They cultivated the Regulations of the Foreign Realm, so their strength would definitely drop greatly after returning to the Celestial Realm.

Thankfully, there were not many elites among them at all. Most of them were at the Severing Mundane Tier and below, and had not touched on Regulations yet, so the effect on them actually was not very strong. At most, they would only be disliked by the heaven and earth.

Ling Han would not interfere with the matter of settling them. In any case, the Celestial Kings would make their own decisions. Furthermore, they could also peek into the cultivation techniques of the Foreign Realm through them. This was considerably meaningful.

After dealing with this matter, Ling Han went out to meet the others.

There were many people, and those closer to him included the Rain Emperor, Yan Xianlu, Yi, and the others, as well as his previous nine doppelgangers such as Ling Huo and the others. Those with more distant relations included Monarch Stars like Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan, monarch tiers, and some whom he had only met once or did not even know as well. Even An Ran had come.

After Shang Zhiwei had fused herself with Heavenly Dao, the grudges between the Roc Palace and Four Seas Palace could be considered wiped from the slate. Thus, An Ran planned to form a truce with Ling Han.

Ling Han sighed. Though Shang Zhiwei had caused the death of Yiyun, he had never met Yiyun before, either, so there wasn’t any kind of affection between them. However, the care and concern that Shang Zhiwei had shown him was genuine, and touched him. Afterwards, when he had seen how deeply devoted she was, he truly admired her.

After getting Hu Niu’s agreement, Ling Han and An Ran wiped their old grudges from the slate. With the common, much stronger, enemy of the Foreign Realm facing them, what could not be let go of?

Everyone asked about his experiences in the Foreign Realm, and Ling Han told them all that he could speak of, but did not mention anything about Void Particle Energy.

Even if he did, it would be useless. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could not grasp this kind of power. It was only an unrealistic Utopian creation, and could not be realized at all.

When everyone heard about how he had shown his powerful might in the Foreign Realm, and defeated various prodigies, ultimately becoming the top Monarch Star, they were all extremely inspired.

Who said that the Celestial Realm was weaker than the Foreign Realm?

See, Ling Han had proven that someone who had walked out of the Celestial Realm was completely capable of becoming stronger than those of the Foreign Realm!

Everyone drank and chatted, and Ling Han even took out some Ancestral King blood, which he distributed among those close to him. The others were extremely envious of this, and wanted nothing more than to become Ling Han’s lackeys.

It continued for seven days, and only then did they disperse and leave one after another.

Ling Han then discussed the matters of their alliance with Yan Xianlu and Yi, giving them some resources, especially Ancestral King blood. Then, he talked with the Rain Emperor for a while, adn bestowed a considerable amount of Ancestral King blood essence on his second brother.

He would naturally not be stingy towards his brothers. He had also lent the Origin Magic Cube so that the Rain Emperor could study it, hoping that his second brother could walk even further.

What was causing Ling Han a headache was Little Terror. This was a war machine born by the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm, but the little guy’s strength had directly fallen down to Genesis Tier after coming into the Celestial Realm because of the different heaven and earth and different Regulations.

“I’ll think of something,” Wally said. “As long as the model for Regulations is modified, anyone could actually survive in any dimension.”

“Yi, who’s this guy?” The large black dog ran over. He had shamelessly demanded a few bottles of Ancestral King blood essence from Ling Han, not caring about the fact that it was actually already useless for him.

“A guest from the Dark Inverse Realm,” Ling Han replied with a smile. Though the large black dog kept screwing others over, he was definitely trustworthy.

The large black dog was curious, and continuously sniffed around Wally. “I can’t smell anything human.”

Wally was unwilling to show weakness, and unleashed a green light scan on the large black dog.

When the green light scan reached the spot between the large black dog’s legs, the large black dog flew into a rage.?Pa, he shot out a paw, and sent Wally flying.

Peng!

His power was incredibly strong, and Wally was instantly shattered into pieces.

“Ah, how is he so fragile?” The large black dog scratched his head, his eyes shifting around, looking guilty.
