Chapter 2542: Old suspicions

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A dead man had come back to life, and burst forth in attack. Even the Imperial Void Celestial King could not have imagined such a thing happening, and added with the red light being too fast, even he had been hit. Two rays of light landed on his chest, and dense smoke instantly arose.

The Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t help but retreat continuously. Looking down, he saw that two holes had been burnt into the fabric of his clothing, and there were two scorched holes on his stomach, penetrating straight into his abdomen, and almost creating two holes that could see through to the other side.

Gods!

He looked towards Wally, and killing intent instantly blazed within him.

“Die!” He moved once again.?Boom, the angry strike of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was extremely terrifying, and Wally immediately crumbled once more.

However, the countless pieces fused back again, and Wally’s revival was close at hand.

“Again?” The Imperial Void Celestial King sneered coldly, and followed up with another attack.?Peng, Wally who was still fusing back together involuntarily exploded into bits again.

The Imperial Void Celestial King attacked again and again, and destroyed Wally before the latter had managed to fuse back into human form repeatedly.

But if Wally could be dealt with so easily, he would not have been qualified to become the pride of a whole dimension.

The broken bits no longer gathered in a single direction, but rather 10 different directions.

This was something that even the Imperial Void Celestial King had not expected. Though he had instantly moved to destroy seven of them, there were still three that transformed successfully, forming three miniature Wallys, who shot out red rays of light from their eyes at the same time.

The Imperial Void Celestial King dodged, but the path that he had dodged on was actually anticipated by Wally. Only a single blast missed him, while the other two blasts landed squarely on him.

“Urgh!” Even the Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t help but cry out in pain. He was furious, and boundless celestial light exploded from him.?Peng, the three mini-Wallys were instantly shattered into bits. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, subsequently, 100 miniature Wallys formed at the same time, and every single Wally was extremely far apart. Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly destroy them all in a single stroke.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?Red lights flashed madly, and even the Imperial Void Celestial King did not dare to be careless. He had to go all out to deal with these attacks.

“Yi, Wally’s strength seems to have considerably increased,” Ling Han said to the large black dog.

The large black dog nodded. “His recovery speed has considerably increased, and his attack power has also become stronger many times over. Even I have to exert some effort in order to suppress him.”

This damn dog was really such a boaster. It should be known that he was slightly inferior compared to the Imperial Void Celestial King, and now even the Imperial Void Celestial King was in such poor condition. If it was this damn dog in his place instead, he would definitely be at an even greater disadvantage.

Ling Han laughed. “This guy has already refined the Dimension Scroll for over 1,000,000 years, so it would be strange if there was no large boost to his strength.”

The Dimension Scroll could allow a mortal to make the leap to the Heavenly Venerable Tier—though this kind of Heavenly Venerate could only be considered the representative of the heaven and earth. The heaven and earth could withdraw his power at any time, but as long as he was still within this cultivation level, his power would be genuinely at the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Wally said he would need 100,000,000 years to fully refine this Dimension Scroll, and now over a million years had passed, so no matter what, he had to have refined at least 1% by now.

Was 1% of power of a Heavenly Venerate not awesome enough, and not enough to cause trouble for a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Of course, Wally definitely could not absorb all this power completely, but even if he only possessed a thousandth, or ten-thousandth of the full power of a Heavenly Venerate, he could still pose a threat for a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

You see, Wally’s defenses were indeed not strong, and could be easily destroyed by a Celestial King, but his attack was similarly amazing, and even the Imperial Void Celestial King could not withstand it completely. Added with his recovery ability, what Celestial King would not be troubled?

Even when the Imperial Void Celestial King was fighting with Ji Wuming in his last life, it was not as straining as fighting with Wally now.

From a certain aspect, Wally was the same as Heavenborn. They both possessed frightening recovery ability, and even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was helpless against that.

“What Dimension Scroll?” the large black dog asked. He still did not know that there was something as valuable as this.

Ling Han gave a simple explanation, and the large black dog’s eyes immediately shone. “Quick, show it to me.”

“Don’t cause trouble.” Ling Han naturally could not agree. If he lent it to the large black dog, that really would be just like throwing a meat bun to a hungry dog; he would never get it back.

The large black dog looked at Wally enviously, and mumbled, “Should I venture to that dimension, and modify myself into a War Dog?”

Ling Han rolled his eyes at him.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was still battling Wally. Outwardly, he was completely enjoying the upper hand, and had destroyed Wally who knew how many times by now, but no matter how many times Wally had been destroyed, he was still able to rapidly reform, and was completely uninjured.

Furthermore, Wally’s attacks could not be underestimated, either, bringing injuries that weren’t too light to the Imperial Void Celestial King as well.

Now, the Imperial Void Celestial King very much wanted to call a ceasefire, but it was he who had started this battle, and he could not bring himself to stop it.

Xiao Yingxiong and the others naturally could see this clearly, and they all rushed to play mediator, offering the Imperial Void Celestial King a way out.

The battle stopped, and the Imperial Void Celestial King was angry. He felt even his face was slightly flushed, and felt like exploding.

In the battle with Ling Han just a few days ago, he had been terribly defeated with a great disadvantage. At that time, he still had an excuse. It was because the Nine Deaths Formation had restricted his cultivation level, and that granted Ling Han an opening to take advantage of.

But now?

He was in his prime condition, but not only could he not do anything to Wally, he was hurting from the blasts that Wally had shot at him. This was truly embarrassing.

He couldn’t bring himself to speak. His face dark, he kept silent on the sidelines, only filled with a greater yearning to become a Heavenly Venerate.

Only after becoming a Heavenly Venerate could he truly escape the control of the heaven and earth, surpassing Regulations. Otherwise, he would still be restrained by Regulations.

Take Heavenborn and Wally for example. The reason why they could not be killed was because their defense and recovery ability were at the pinnacle of Regulations, and only a Heavenly Venerate could deal with this.

Wally was still expressionless. Though he had caused extreme exasperation and gloom for a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he still showed no hint of pride.

Xiao Yingxiong and the others were all stunned. Naturally, they now had a considerably higher opinion of Wally again. This guy’s level of freakishness could compare to Heavenborn’s.

A strange thought suddenly came to Ling Han. “If Wally were to fight with Heavenborn, what would be the outcome?”

“There would probably be no outcome even if they fought until the end of time,” the large black dog answered, and then changed the topic abruptly. “Brat, we have to quickly cultivate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to its peak stage, or we could be surpassed by others in the area of physique.”

“Yi, you have also cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll?” Ling Han was surprised.

“Of course; I have started cultivating it much earlier than you have,” the large black dog declared proudly. “It was just that previously, my bloodline was not suitable for it, so my accomplishments in the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll were limited. Later, though I was forced to undergo a great rebirth, I have also obtained a drop of blood essence of the Heavenly Venerate as my base. Thus, there isn’t any difficulty at all in my cultivation of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll now.” He paused. “Now that we’re on it, Grandpa Dog can be considered your ancestor!”

“Get lost!” Ling Han felt like giving him the middle finger, but he immediately cried out in surprise. “Then why is my bloodline suitable?”

There was something that was very strange; why had the Black Tower found him?

It should be known that he was only very awesome in the area of alchemy, and it was not just a little bit awesome, but his natural talent in cultivation was not outstanding, and he couldn’t even compare to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

“Fool!” The large black dog scoffed. “That is because you possess the bloodline of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable!”

“Impossible!” Ling Han was stunned. Could it be that he was a descendant of Yi Yun?

“Idiot!” The large black dog shook his head. “Could it be that Lord Heavenly Venerate has no cousins or the sort? Though there is still some distance, there is still a bloodline resonance. Otherwise, why do you think the Tower of Three Realms just happened to fly into your small world?”

Ling Han nodded. “That small world has already gone into the Ancient Realm through opening the sky previously, and then became a small world again. Could it be that this is the doing of the Tower of Three Realms?”

“What else could it be then?” the large black dog countered.

“But why did it happen only after several epochs?” Ling Han continued to ask.

“Nonsense. The Tower of Three Realms was severely injured in the first place, and turning the Lower Realm back into a small world to avoid the divine sense of Heavenly Venerates had already exhausted all its power. It could only slowly recover its power. Afterwards, you just happened to find it, and that was why it fused with you,” the large black dog said seriously.
