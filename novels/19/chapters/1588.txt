Chapter 1589: Just playing around

But who asked Ling Han to be holding their lifeline at this moment?

All the Heaven Demons discussed with each other for a while, and they finally “requested” the grand elder of the Tan Clan to go somewhere further away. This infuriated the grand elder of the Tan Clan; as a noble peak stage Heaven Demon, he stood at the highest summit of the Netherworld, yet because of the request of a mere Eternal River Tier, he had been driven off.

‘Holy f*ck!’ T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan spoke, “Young friend—”

“Oh, now I remember!” Ling Han suddenly interrupted, breaking off what this person had been saying. “That is the old geezer from the Tan Clan, right? I forgot that I deliberately asked for him to come. En, en, en, you guys go and call him back over.”

All the Heaven Demons felt an urge to throw up blood. ‘Are you f****** playing with us?’

Even if these people were very subtle, and had astonishing self-restraint, their expressions involuntarily turned livid at this time.

“If you won’t, I’m leaving.” Ling Han deliberately turned around. Though entering into the Black Tower was only the matter of a single thought for him, he had to show his attitude here.

“Don’t!” the Heaven Demons all hurriedly called out simultaneously.

Fine, the grand elder of the Tan Clan was again “asked” to come back. However, though he was able to return, his expression was already livid. He was not a dog, and he was being called over here and over there like this. If it was someone else in his shoes, who wouldn’t have some temper?

Ling Han glanced at the Grand elder of the Tan Clan with a smile, and said, “Yi, old geezer, are you in a bad mood? You’re already so old, so don’t keep getting angry. What if you suddenly choke in your anger and suddenly die to meet your ancestors?”

The grand elder of the Tan Clan simply closed his eyes. What the eye didn’t see, the heart didn’t grieve over.

When the people in the surrounding area saw this, they couldn’t help but be incredibly impressed with Ling Han.

What Eternal River Tier had you seen that would dare speak like this to a Heaven Demon? Furthermore, he was completely unscathed even after provoking him, forcing the grand elder of the Tan Clan to swallow his anger.

“Young friend, don’t change the topic,” the Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan continued. “We are also very sincere now, so can you continue?”

“You guys really have no sense for entertainment.” Ling Han sighed. “A bunch of old antiques, putting on stern faces for the whole day, not even smiling a bit. I even thought your faces were made out of stone.”

He paused, and then continued, “Fine then, we’ll first discuss the matter of my compensation.”

‘What about your compensation? What losses have you experienced?’

The Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan asked, “Young friend, you don’t seem to have had any losses, right?”

“How could I not?” Ling Han’s expression was angry. “Old man, your eyes are really too faulty, how can you not see this? I was harrassed in all manner by those three bastards, suffering great emotional damage. During this time, I didn’t even manage a good night of sleep, and don’t tell me that this is not a loss?”

He was an Eternal River Tier, however. In the first place, he was completely fine even without sleep, and secondly, how could it be that he would be so angered up to this extent just because of a small issue like this?

Everyone was speechless. At first, the grand elder of the Tan Clan only planned to be a spectator, but when he heard these words from Ling Han, he almost exploded in fury. ‘You suffered emotional damage, then what about the deaths of three clansmen from my Tan Clan? How is this to be accounted for?’

The Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan almost bent his nose in fury too; when had he ever experienced being called an old man right in front of his face like this? He took a deep breath, and suppressed his stirring emotions. Only then did he say, “All right, I can decide this matter. I guarantee that it will satisfy you.”

Ling Han waved them off, and said, “Actually, I am not really a greedy person. As for compensation, it would be enough to just casually give me a dozen Saintly medicines.”

...You were really not greedy, and only demanded 12 Saintly medicines!

The Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan did not know what else to say by now. He opened his mouth, but did not manage to say a single word.

This was committing daylight robbery, quoting such a massive compensation that even he did not know how he was supposed to start bargaining.

“Impossible!” the Heaven Demon from the Zhang Clan declared firmly. What a joke, a dozen Saintly medicines? What did you think Saintly medicines were! Even for Forbidden Lands like theirs, they only grew one or two Saintly medicines, and only managed to harvest them once in tens of millions or even millions and millions of years.

Saintly medicines naturally were used for those that needed them the most to break through, or used to heal injuries to great dao. Throughout these many years, it was natural that most of them had been used up, and it was already impressive for each Forbidden Land to manage to keep one or two Saintly medicines.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I already said, I am not a greedy person, so just set the matter of the Saintly medicine to one side first. The Tan Clan bullied me intolerably; I request for the grand elder of the Tan Clan to apologize to me.”

Gasp!

Hearing these words, everyone was stunned.

Brat, you were really awesome.

The grand elder of the Tan Clan was a peak stage Heaven Demon, a top-tier existence in the whole Netherworld, an absolutely inarguable big shot, and you actually demanded that he apologize to you?

Awesome, awesome, awesome. Putting aside that you were merely an Eternal River Tier, even if the eight great Forbidden Lands combined forces to exert pressure, the grand elder of the Tan Clan might not submit like that, either.

How was he going to live in future? What face would he have left to see others?

Not a single Heaven Demon spoke any longer. This implicated the grand elder of the Tan Clan, and no one else’s words would count for anything. Could it be that they could force down the head of the grand elder from the Tan Clan, and force him to apologize?

The grand elder of the Tan Clan naturally could no longer pretend to be deaf or dumb. He looked at the many big shots here, and forcibly suppressed his fury as he said, “Young man, I can promise you that as long as you hand over the Celestial King technique, the debts with the Tan Clan... will be written off!”

When he said these words, his expression appeared malevolent.

He very much wanted to kill Ling Han, but he could do nothing about it. At present, Ling Han was calling the shots here, and if he did not compromise at this time, he would become the combined target of the other eight great Forbidden Lands.

For the sake of the Celestial King technique, he would swallow his fury!

Ling Han suddenly stood up, his face filled with anger. “Old man, you are too unreasonable! It was your clansmen that came to harrass me and disturb me; I am the victim here! I should be the one to say that the debt is written off; what do you mean by saying that?”

The grand elder of the Tan Clan flew into a thunderous rage, and declared, “Brat, I have tolerated you for a very long time, you are merely being deliberately provoking us here!”

Ling Han paused, and then grinned. “This intelligence of yours, really... Sigh, how should I put it? Only now can you tell that I am just playing around with you all? You people really are extraordinarily dumb.”

Shua, all the big shots were angered. When had they ever been tricked before? Moreover, they were all tricked at the same time?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and exclaimed, “Don’t scare me; I will run away if I am scared!” He paused, and then continued, “Old Geezer Tan, do you dare fight a duel with me?”

A, a duel!

At this, everyone was dumbfounded.

A mere Eternal River Tier actually declared that he wanted to duel a Demon Master! Moreover, this was no ordinary Demon Master, but a peak stage Demon Master, a big shot that stood at the apex of the Netherworld!

Was he seeking death?

This brat had just been expressing his pity for the intelligence of others just now, and now it was his intelligence that was in the negative?

Yet the grand elder of the Tan Clan smiled in his extreme fury. What was going on with this world? A mere Eternal River Tier actually dared issue a challenge to him? He humphed, and asked, “What qualifies you to exchange blows with me?”

“Is this enough reason?” Ling Han grinned. “If you defeat me, I will give you the Celestial King technique.”

As simple as that?

How could an Eternal River Tier possibly be any match for a peak stage Heaven Demon? This was really just like what he said—he was “giving” him the celestial technique.

The grand elder of the Tan Clan hesitated slightly, but immediately nodded. As long as Ling Han did not duck into that Celestial Tool, he would be able to apprehend the latter. By then, who cared whether he would hand over the Celestial King technique or not. It would no longer be up to him to decide.

“All right!” he agreed.
