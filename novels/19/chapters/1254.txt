‘Immortal flames?’

To say nothing of immortal flames, even level six divine flames could incinerate Ling Han if he were burned for half a year or even a year. His physique was indeed powerful, but it still couldn’t withstand being burned for so long. If he were burned by level seven divine flames, 10-15 days would be enough to incinerate him.

As for level eight, nine, or 10 divine flames, these could probably incinerate him in an instant.

Immortal flames... Heh.

Entering these flames would be seeking death!

He wouldn’t be able to withstand these flames even if he were at the Heavenly Body Tier. He was only at the Sun Moon Tier right now, so how could he possibly withstand them?

“What, are you scared?” Small Tower asked. It didn’t urge him to enter.

Ling Han grimaced, and said, “Are you sure I can rise from the ashes?”

“In the outside world, even level eight divine flames can incinerate you in an instant, to say nothing of immortal flames,” Small Tower said calmly. “Here, however, you can maintain a small portion of your divine sense. This portion of divine sense will be undying, and it will allow you to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Whenever you comprehend the profound mystery of rising from the ashes is when your body will reappear.”

Small Tower paused for a moment before adding, “Moreover, there are some tiny imperfections in your body even though you fused your two souls together. Only by rising from the ashes can you fully fuse the two versions of yourself.”

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and resolutely leaped into the cauldron.

He was genuinely diving into flames, Ling Han mocked himself as he channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Boom!

He was swallowed by the terrifying flames, and he wasn’t able to resist a single bit as he was incinerated into nothingness. This was the power of immortal flames. Its level was far too transcendent. Even if Notionless Saint were to come, and even if he were at his peak, he wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of being incinerated by the immortal flames.

Under normal circumstances, Ling Han would already be dead. However, a mysterious power in the Black Tower protected a wisp of his divine sense.

It was only a wisp of his divine sense, not his entire divine sense. The immortal flames could incinerate even divine sense.

Ling Han felt as if he had returned to 10,000 years ago. At that time, the Black Tower had obliterated his body, leaving him with only a wisp of his divine sense. He had comprehended the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll in that peculiar state, and he had only been reborn after 10,000 years.

He was in a similar state at this moment—his body had been obliterated, and he couldn’t move at all. However, he still had to endure being burned by the immortal flames. This was extremely excruciating.

As this was a torturous pain that cut straight into his divine sense, it was impossible for him to lose consciousness. He was forced to endure this profound suffering. This made him want to scream.

However, he had no physical body now, so he couldn’t scream even if he wanted to.

A thought suddenly surged into his mind. ‘Why don’t I just give up and die. This pain is far too unbearable.’

Ling Han was shocked by the appearance of this thought. So, it turned out that he still hadn’t severed his thoughts of hesitation and cowardice. Now that he was experiencing such boundless pain, these feelings were finally exploding in his mind.

He tried to suppress this thought, yet the immortal flames burned through to his soul. Excruciating pain came in waves, each more intense than the last. His willpower started to waver.

He had indeed endured a lot of pain before this. However, it had all been on a physical level. He had never endured pain like this, where he was devoid of a physical body and the pain was acting straight on his divine sense.

Even with willpower as powerful as his, he still felt an urge to end this pain through death.

His willpower grew weaker and weaker, and the fire in his soul flickered as if it were about to go out.

If he gave up now, he would never be able to crawl up again.

‘No!’

What had he cultivated so hard for? It definitely wasn’t to die here!

He had family, friends, lovers, and a son he still hadn’t seen yet. Moreover, he still hadn’t suppressed the savage woman, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden! The Five Sects hadn’t been obliterated, either, and he still had yet to find the mysterious assassin who had attacked him on his journey from the Joint Peace Planet to the Flying Cloud Planet.

There were far too many people waiting for him, and there were far too many things that he still wanted to do, so how could he die here?

A spark appeared in his mind as he strengthened his resolve to live. He channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll in his divine sense. This cultivation technique tempered both the physical body and divine sense, and thus it could still be channeled even though only his divine sense remained.

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, again and again. His divine sense finally escaped from the brink of destruction.

However, this only protected the vitality of his divine sense, and prevented it from being incinerated. It didn’t free him from the pain of being burned by the immortal flames. In reality, the longer he resisted, the longer he would be burned. The pain that he felt wouldn’t decrease by an iota.

‘Rising from the ashes.’

Small Tower’s words flashed through Ling Han’s mind. Resisting the immortal flames wasn’t his aim. With his current abilities, it would be impossible for him to resist the immortal flames. The only reason he was alive was because he was in the Black Tower. His task was to comprehend the profound mystery of rising from the ashes.

Meanwhile, his reference for this comprehension would be the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll—a section of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had come from the secret technique of the Immortal Phoenix. Thus, Ling Han would grasp the Mystical Power of Rising From The Ashes once he managed to truly comprehend this section of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Consequently, he would genuinely possess the power of indestructibility.

Ling Han continued to analyze this section of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll as he endured the burning pain of the immortal flames. He hadn’t noticed anything special about this section before, but now that he was being burned by the immortal flames, he suddenly developed a completely new understanding of it.

‘So this is how it is. So that’s what this meant. Oh, I never considered this before.’

He continued to exclaim in his mind. Although the immortal flames caused him great agony, they also allowed him to experience the feeling of death and rebirth.

Of course, just experiencing this feeling wasn’t enough. He also had to understand and comprehend it. Only by doing so would he be able to truly grasp this secret technique.

Numerous golden symbols floated through his divine sense, distorting and shifting as they did. In the end, they transformed into numerous True Phoenixes, all of which craned their necks and soared into the sky, boundless flames burning on their bodies.

No, these weren’t True Phoenixes... They were Immortal Phoenixes!

Ling Han was suddenly struck by enlightenment. Immortal Dragons were probably of the water element, while Immortal Phoenixes were probably of the fire element. They each represented an extreme. Although the Black Dragon Race that Ao Ziyun belonged to played with fire, they were a complete “mongrel” of a race. They couldn’t compare to Immortal Phoenixes at all.

‘Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire!

‘Could it be that these immortal flames were actually left by an Immortal Phoenix?’

If this weren’t the case, how could he still be alive? These flames were definitely related to the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, which in turn was partially related to Immortal Phoenixes! Otherwise, how could he comprehend the unique secret technique of the Immortal Phoenix—Rising From The Ashes—through being burned by the immortal flames?

The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had clearly referenced a portion of the Immortal Phoenixes’ secret technique.

Ling Han’s mind gradually became calmer as this realization flashed in his mind.

He was confident in his comprehension abilities. Moreover, this was the Black Tower, so he definitely could comprehend this secret technique.

Time slowly crept by.

One day, two days, three days...

After 11 days, a spot of light suddenly rose from the cauldron.

Small Tower instantly became excited, its body flickering between light and dark. It didn’t have a physical body to begin with, and it was simply a holographic image of a tower. Small Tower immediately launched into action.

Weng!

The lid of the cauldron closed, instantly making the soaring flames disappear.

The spot of light bounced around for a while before suddenly falling to the ground. Surprisingly, it was a glowing fetus. Inside the fetus was a small human.

COMMENT

This was an infant... This was Ling Han!

Success!

Ling Han had finally comprehended the secret technique—Rising From The Ashes. However, it seemed like something was off as rebirth from this secret technique should have returned him to his original state. However, he had become an infant!

“Hahahaha!” Small Tower couldn’t help but burst into laughter.
