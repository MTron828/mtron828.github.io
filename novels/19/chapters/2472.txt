Chapter 2473: Consecutive conquests

Little Terror pounced out. It was not affected by the purple light here, so there was no decrease to its battle prowess. Hence, it was overwhelmingly powerful.

That Celestial King paled in shock. He had never expected that this little beast’s battle prowess would be so astonishing. He did not know that Little Terror was unaffected by the restraints of the purple light here, and instead wondered just how many times over would Little Terror’s battle prowess be further boosted if they were fighting inside the structure.

Little Terror unleashed its might. How could that Celestial King still manage to sufficiently guard the entrance? Instantly, they aggressively burst through, and brought their battle into the palace.

By that point, Yi’s battle prowess was fully unleashed. The powerful strength of a monarch tier surged out fiercely as he worked together with Little Terror. In a few moments, they sent that Celestial King flying out of the palace, leaving him fleeing for his life in a sorry state.

Ling Han once more proficiently found the control post here. Then, releasing his own spiritual power, he took the initiative to “invite the enemy in.”

Weng, a sliver of divine sense took form, and appeared within Ling Han’s mind. It was the Dark Frost Celestial King.

“Hey, we meet again,” Ling Han greeted.

This sliver of divine sense had been left behind by Dark Frost Celestial King a very long time ago, so he did not know anything that happened afterwards. Naturally, he was very confused. What did the other party mean by ‘again’?

Then he was greatly enraged. A mere Pseudo-Celestial King actually dared to touch his territory?

“Nothing but a mere Pseudo-Celestial King, you are truly courting death!” he declared disdainfully.

This reaction was completely the same as the first time. As expected of the same person—having the same personality, he would react in the exact same way.

Ling Han’s expression was rather strange. If he swept through 10 of Dark Frost Celestial King’s bases in a row, and the latter’s divine sense would have this kind of reaction every single time, wouldn’t it be very funny?

“Come battle, then!” He couldn’t be bothered to waste any more words. This scene had already happened once previously, so what was the point of having it acted out again?

......

He took the initiative to charge out, stretched out his hands, and grabbed several streaks of Regulations, turning them into a saber, spear, sword, and halberd, and blasting them towards Dark Frost Celestial King.

“A mere Pseudo-Celestial King actually has grasp of so many Regulations, you truly are extraordinary!” Dark Frost Celestial King raised a brow, appearing very surprised.

Ling Han sighed. “You have said these words before as well.”

The Dark Frost Celestial King humphed, and similarly manipulated the Regulations to battle fiercely with Ling Han. His strength was extraordinary, and Ling Han was completely incapable of suppressing him. He could only exhaust his power completely first, and only then could he kill him.

But after fighting for a while, the Dark Frost Celestial King could not conceal his shock once again. “The battle prowess of a Pseudo-Celestial King can actually reach such levels; you must have obtained some supreme inheritance!” His expression was completely moved. He wanted nothing more than for his main body to immediately charge over, and snatch all the secrets that belonged to Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded. “This reaction is a new one. I anticipate that you would have other different reactions the next time, when I uproot your third base.”

“Arrogance!” The Dark Frost Celestial King smirked coldly, with boundless wild waves unfurling behind him and striking out at Ling Han. Every drop of liquid had condensed the Regulations of the Great Dao, and it was guaranteed that an Ascending Origin Tier would immediately perish once hit.

Ling Han was naturally unafraid. He, too, channeled the Regulations of Water, turning it into a colossal sword that slashed out at the mad wave.

Boom, the mad wave was split apart forcefully, and Ling Han burst through aggressively, blasting the Dark Frost Celestial King.

The Dark Frost Celestial King was astounded. How could it be that this brat seemed like he knew him like the back of his hand? No matter what move he used, the latter could immediately choose a tactic to deal with it. It was like he had known him for tens of billions of years, possessing a very clear, thorough understanding about him.

He naturally would not know that Ling Han had already battled a very long time with his first sliver of divine sense, so he was naturally very familiar with him by now. But to him, Ling Han was completely unfamiliar, so their positions were completely unequal.

The two of them fought fiercely, and the Dark Frost Celestial King gradually fell into a disadvantage. His every move was targeted by Ling Han, and no matter what he did, he could not reverse his progress into defeat.

The more the Dark Frost Celestial King fought, the more stunned he was. It really seemed like Ling Han had studied him thoroughly. Whatever his reaction, Ling Han had anticipated it. He now thought back to Ling Han’s previous words. Could it be that the latter really had uprooted one of his bases?

No, he had to return to the main body. This brat was too freakish, and had great secrets. Who knew, maybe the value of those secrets surpassed the value of the treasure trove hidden in the heart of the ruins.

When this thought arose, he immediately turned, planning to flee.

He was just a sliver of divine sense, and could come and go as he pleased.

Ling Han laughed. He had led the other party into this trap, so how could he possibly allow the Dark Frost Celestial King to run?

He had already laid down an inescapable net around his mind. If the Dark Frost Celestial King had started to escape immediately after he had entered, Ling Han really would not have completely laid out the net yet, and could not have stopped him. But if the Dark Frost Celestial King still wanted to flee after such a long time of fighting, it was already an impossible feat.

After about 100 exchanges, Ling Han shattered this sliver of divine sense, and laid down his own spiritual mark. Instantly, the Black Tower shook slightly, as expected.

Coincidentally, just as he completed this action, a peculiar light shot down from above, and fragrance wafted through the air.

***

In the heart of the ruins.

The Dark Frost Celestial King stiffened again, and was almost sent flying by a vine.

“Brother Dark Frost, what’s wrong with you again?” The Third Heaven Celestial King beside him frowned. Was this ally really all that dependable?

“Another of my bases have been occupied,” the Dark Frost Celestial King replied, his expression dark.

The Celestial King beside him was surprised. Could it be that someone was purposely targeting him? To actually uproot two of the Dark Frost Celestial King’s bases in a row, was this a provocation?

“After taking this precious tower down, I will definitely charge back!” the Dark Frost Celestial King declared coldly, and humphed. He vented the fury he felt on that extremely powerful vine in front of him.?Boom, an icy chill spread out, his battle prowess was incredibly terrifying.

***

Ling Han and the others absorbed the benefits of the peculiar light and peculiar fragrance. With the resonance of three structures, the boost of the benefits was around 60%. Even if there were only 30 minutes, using time acceleration effects, their progress was still extremely shocking.

Of course, Yi was not included. He did not have a physique of Time.

Cultivating now really had very great benefits to forming a Celestial Seed. Ling Han had a feeling that if he cultivated a few more hundred times like this, there would be completely no need for him to contend for that perfect Celestial Seed. His own Celestial Seed was definitely capable of becoming flawless and perfect.

“There may be treasures hidden here that would allow the Black Tower to recover. If I only possess the strength that I have now, it is completely inadequate in a battle against a Third Heaven Celestial King. I have to become a Celestial King.

“Just give me some more time.”

Ling Han did not want to waste time. After he had completed cultivation, he left Yi behind to guard this tower while he brought the three women with him, and they continued onwards, trying to conquer a new base once every three days.

Of course, these bases would definitely all be the Dark Frost Celestial King’s bases.

If the Dark Frost Celestial King knew this, he would definitely fly into a rage.

…Just how much effort had he exerted when he had conquered these bases?

Not only did he have to contend with others, clearing the plants that had nested here caused him to expend great effort. It could be said that everything had been obtained at the expense of blood.

Ling Han and his group soon found the next structure. There was no need for questions; the Celestial King that had guarded that other palace was here presently. Two great Celestial Kings blocked the entrance, wanting to stop Ling Han and the others. This naturally was pointless effort. Very quickly, Ling Han and his group broke through their defenses.

It was the same routine when he erased the Dark Frost Celestial King’s divine sense. This Celestial King was initially very arrogant, but as they fought, he would discover that the situation was turning worse, and wanted to flee. In the end, it was naturally impossible that he could succeed, and he would be forcefully destroyed by Ling Han.

This time, Ling Han and his group slowed their progress, waiting for Yan Xianlu and the others to rush over from the front.

They waited 11 days. When Yan Xianlu and the others arrived, Ling Han shockingly discovered that their party had actually strengthened many times over.
