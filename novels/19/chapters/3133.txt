3134 Cultivation level soaring

Compared to the increase in strength, what was a little pain worth?

On Ling Han’s whole journey up to this point, had he had any lack of this kind of tempering?

The second fruit was consumed and being digested in his stomach. Boom, the terrifying energy once again turned into massive waves that wreaked havoc in his body.

Ling Han firmed his resolve, and used Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique as a guide.

The Seven Meridians middle stage, late stage, peak stage, and finally he reached the crucial moment again.

Ling Han sensed his eighth meridian, and with a slight tremor, he had already crossed over into this new threshold.

“Wa!” He still spat out a mouthful of blood. Under the frenzied surge of energy wreaking havoc within, his eighth meridian was penetrated through in an incredibly rough manner, which naturally caused his internal organs to go on a rampage.

However, the Precious Fruit’s power had also been exhausted.

The first fruit pushed Ling Han’s cultivation level to a whole new level altogether, but for the second fruit, the cultivation level attained was slightly inferior.

It couldn’t be helped. The energy needed to break through into Eight Meridians would definitely far supersede the energy needed for Seven Meridians.

Ling Han looked at the last fruit. Would this help him charge forward to Nine Meridians?

Without hesitation, he plucked the last fruit and consumed it. Boom, a tsunami wave of energy surged in his body for the third time.

Eight Meridians middle stage, late stage, peak stage.

At this moment, the energy storm had already calmed down, and was no longer as surging as before.

Then, it immediately became calm.

He was just that little bit away.

Ling Han felt that it was a pity. As long as this fruit still had that little bit of power, he would be able to move with the flow, sense his ninth meridian, and advance into the Nine Meridians at one go.

Yi?

He faltered for a moment. This was because he could sense slivers of power drifting around him. Previously, it had been close to zero, yet now, it was surging.

Realization dawned upon Ling Han. It was time for the sun to rise.

Good!

He continued to channel the Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique, and stimulated the mystical power of heaven and earth in the surroundings to open up the ninth meridian in his body.

After more than ten minutes, Ling Han’s body trembled. His ninth meridian had already opened, and energy was surging in like a small stream, circulating through this meridian.

Nine Meridians. Success!

At present, his advancement was extremely slow. After all, he was only extracting the power of heaven and earth, unlike the Precious Fruit, with the Treasure Tree having taken root, who knew how much mystical power of heaven and earth had been absorbed and condensed within the fruit. The sudden explosion of such energy, was naturally incredibly swift and fierce.

However, true cultivation was accumulated over time. How could it be that there would be Treasured Fruits to eat every day?

Half an hour later, Ling Han stopped. He could no longer sense the mystical power of heaven and earth, so he naturally could no longer cultivate.

He stood up and swept his gaze over the surrounding houses. He wanted to explore. It was possible that there were alchemical pills of ancient times left behind inside. Then, if he ingested them one by one, would they be able to directly send him to attain Twelve Meridians?

It didn’t matter even if he improved too quickly. He could calm down and carefully temper himself when he was in the Twelve Meridians, and when he has become incomparably stable, he could then attempt to break through to the next major tier.

Although he still didn’t know what the next major tier was, he was sure that definitely there would be.

He took a few steps, and was only just over a meter away from the nearest building. However, an incredibly dangerous feeling suddenly rose up in his heart. He felt that if he took another step forwards, he would die.

He was judging based on the formations he had previously studied, and his expression couldn’t help but change drastically.

The power of this formation would become greater the closer one got to the area of the houses. Thus, if he had only vomited blood from being slashed previously, it was possible that he would be directly severed in the next moment.

With his current strength and attainments in formations, it was too difficult.

Ling Han nodded. He could only give up now. When he has become much stronger, or when his mastery of formations had improved, he would come here to try again.

He turned around and looked at the exit.

Li Changdan was still sitting there, holding a sword in his hand, his eyes extremely fierce.

His two lower legs had been severed. The pain was naturally heart-wrenching, and what supported Li Changdan’s waiting was naturally his hatred for Ling Han.

He wanted revenge, revenge, revenge!

Seeing that Ling Han was finally walking towards him, Li Changdan sneered.

You’re finally unable to endure your thirst, and want to go out, right?

What was the use of three fruits? Would they be able to quench one’s thirst or relieve one’s hunger?

Come, accept your death!

Ling Han walked over. He had already seen through the formations in this area, so he walked easily and calmly, as if he was walking on flat ground. Soon, he arrived at a spot that was only six meters away from Li Changdan.

However, he couldn’t release his power. Even at such a close distance, Li Changdan didn’t dare to act recklessly. The formations were in front of him, and there was terrifying killing intent.

“Staying here all this while, I trust it’s not because you want to escort me back to the sect, right?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Li Changdan forcefully suppressed his anger and replied calmly, “No.”

“You want to kill me so badly?”

“Yes!”

“Are you capable of killing me?”

“Naturally!”

Ling Han nodded and strode towards Li Changdan. “Then let’s give it a try!”

Shua, a flash of sword light swept past. Li Changdan brandished his sword, stabbing towards Ling Han’s chest.

He actually wanted to pierce Ling Han’s throat, but because his legs were broken, his height was not high enough. Thus, this strike could only pierce towards Ling Han’s chest.

Ling Han shot out with a punch, parrying the incoming attack of the long sword.

Li Changdan couldn’t help but sneer. Did this brat think that just because he had crippled both his legs, all his strength was rendered useless?

Fine, I will break this guy’s arms first!

However, just as the blade of the sword was about to collide with Ling Han’s fist, Ling Han’s arm twisted in an inconceivable manner, turning into a fist that struck the body of his sword.

Peng, the fist hit, and instantly, a massive force reverberated.

The long sword slanted to one side. Naturally, without an accurate aim, it couldn’t pierce anything.

Li Changdan felt a pain in the web between his thumb and forefinger, and almost let go of his sword. He couldn’t help but feel stunned. Just how great was this power?

“You—” He looked at Ling Han in shock, and felt that his mind was in complete chaos.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Without enough abilities, how would I dare to ask Senior Brother Li for guidance?”

“It’s those three Treasured Fruits!” Li Changdan finally understood. Ling Han had eaten three fruits just then. It must be because these fruits were too precious that this guy’s strength had soared. In fact, he wasn’t inferior to him at all.

“You guessed correctly.” Ling Han touched his fists together. “Li Changdan, I’ve never trifled with you, yet you first sent Zheng Tongfeng to lure me to the casino, and then made Rui Yuanliang and the others frame me just because I might threaten your status as the Dao Child?”

“Isn’t that enough?” Li Changdan said through gritted teeth, his expression twisted.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Your framework is pitifully small. The world is so big, and as long as one has abilities, what place can’t he rise?”

“Then why are you snatching my position as Dao Child!” Li Changdan roared harshly.

“Snatch your position?” Ling Han laughed in spite of himself. Had the position of Dao Child already been reserved for Li Changdan?

Forget it. This kind of person was extremely self-centred. What was there to say?

He would kill him!

Ling Han unleashed his Demonic Monkey Fists, unleashing a boundless might.

Li Changdan was at a disadvantageous position, so he slapped the ground with one hand to shake himself up. Then, he adjusted his position. However, this was ultimately not nimble enough. Very soon, Ling Han approached him, and in a few moves, he had sent the longsword in his hand flying.

Pu, Ling Han followed up with another punch, which landed on Li Changdan’s chest, instantly creating an obvious groove.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
