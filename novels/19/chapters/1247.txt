Ling Han didn’t accept the letter. Instead, he just chuckled softly.

“What’s so funny?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked unhappily.

“That, um, are you sure you won’t regret this?” Ling Han asked.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden didn’t understand what he was trying to say. She waved the letter in her hand, and said, “Big Sister Yun is a good person. I hope you can cherish this opportunity.”

Pu!

Ling Han almost spluttered aloud. ‘Big Sister Yun?’

He had listened around these few days, and he knew that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had a good friend called Zhu Liyun. However, she was a middle-aged woman!

‘Auntie, is it really good for an old cow to eat fresh grass1?’

Although absolute age was relatively unimportant to immortals, relative age between partners should still be similar, right? Ling Han couldn’t help but shiver upon thinking of Zhu Liyun’s slightly aging appearance.

He was so traumatized that he probably couldn’t eat for a year.

“Say, I traveled tens of millions of kilometers to look for you, yet you’re pushing me into the lap of some other woman. Moreover, it’s a woman who can almost be my great-grandmother! Is that really good?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s expression instantly became cautious. Sure enough, this man was having indecent thoughts about her.

Someone as beautiful as her was a rare sight even in the Immortal Realm. Thus, it wasn’t surprising that this man was interested in her. However, her heart had become like a block of frozen ice already, and it wouldn’t melt for another man.

“Please watch yourself!” she said. “The most important thing is to cherish the people before you. Don’t try to bite off more than you can chew!”

“I wholeheartedly agree! One has to cherish the person before them!” Ling Han gazed at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden lovingly, and said, “It’s been 10,000 years, and you haven’t changed a single bit.”

“What nonsense are you speaking?!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said coldly.

“Hehe!” Ling Han chuckled, and then used his divine sense to transmit a series of sounds.

A look of disbelief instantly appeared on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s face, and she cried in astonishment, “How do you know my name?!”

The Cloud Phoenix Tribe was a bloodline descendant of the ancient True Phoenix. Moreover, the bloodline of the True Phoenix would awaken in the tribe members who possessed the purest of bloodlines. The most unique aspect of this awakening was that one would awaken their “True Name”.

This was a name that was imprinted in their bloodline, and only the owner of the bloodline would know this name.

True Names were of utmost significance to True Phoenixes. Once activated, their True Name would increase their power explosively. Moreover, according to ancient tribe rules, there were only two options if one’s true name was revealed to a second person.

Marry them... or kill them! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In her entire life, she had only revealed her True Name to one man.

However, that man should have been dead already!

“W-who on earth are you?!” she yelped in astonishment. The fact that he was called Ling Han was already strange enough, yet he had actually spoken her True Name as well!

“Stupid girl, you bullied me for so many years, yet you’ve forgotten me just like that?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Ling Han! You’re really Ling Han!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s mind was numb with shock. She was in absolute disbelief.

“It’s me, I’m back!” Ling Han said with a nod.

“But how is this possible?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said in confusion.

“Nothing is impossible,” Ling Han said. He sighed in emotion before continuing, “10,000 years ago, I went to explore an ancient site. However, I came across great danger, and ended up having my physical body destroyed. My divine sense miraculously survived, though, and I was finally given a second lease on life 10,000 years later.

“I opened the sky and came to the Immortal Realm, for no other reason than to find you!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was still lost in shock, and she said, “You actually opened the sky?”

Back then, Ling Han could barely resist when he was bullied by her. Although she had thought of him as her husband in the depths of her heart, her personality was extremely proud. So, how could she treat him gently?

However, even she had possessed no confidence in opening the sky. Ling Han had been so weak back then, so how had he suddenly become so strong now?

“Haha, change is the only constant, and the wheel of fortune turns! I’m no longer a fool who only knows how to refine pills!” Ling Han smiled, and said, “Say, Wife, I was bullied by you quite a lot back then. However, when my cultivation level draws level with yours, it’ll be time for me to bully you!”

“W-who’s your wife?” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s face instantly flushed red with embarrassment. She finally believed that this Ling Han was the Ling Han from before. The fact that he could speak her True Name was proof—nothing could be as convincing as this.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Then who referred to themself as the Ling Family’s Widow?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was extremely embarrassed. She had called herself the Ling Family’s Widow to commemorate Ling Han and to make her determination clear. She wanted to prevent other men from having any thoughts about her.

Now, however, her legitimate husband had reappeared before her.

Ling Han pointed at the letter in her hand, and said, “Say, Wife, do you still insist on handing that letter to me?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden became even more embarrassed, and she instantly shattered the letter to shreds, saying, “Don’t tease me!”

“Hehe!” Ling Han shuffled over, and said, “Come here, Wife, it’s already been 10,000 years. Aren’t we going to reunite with a kiss?”

“Go away!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden hurriedly pushed him back, and said, “We haven’t seen each other for 10,000 years, yet you’ve become such a smooth talker. Have you been with other women?” When she said this, killing intent instantly started to emanate from her body.

How proud a person was she? Back then, she had been a top-echelon elite in the Lower Realm, someone who could compete for glory with the Sword Emperor and the Saber Emperor. Her personality was like that of a queen. So, how could she tolerate sharing her man with other women?

Cold sweat formed on Ling Han’s forehead. The instincts of women were truly terrifying! He had barely begun to flirt with her, yet she had already caught onto something! “Right now, you’re my only wife in the Immortal Realm,” he said hurriedly.

This was a big fat truth. Liu Yu Tong, Shui Yanyu, and the others had all been taken to the Celestial Realm by his jealous little lover, Hu Niu. As for Empress Luan Xing, she wasn’t technically his wife yet. Thus, he was being completely honest.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was half convinced and half suspicious. Why did his admission sound so quirky? If he didn’t have any other woman, he could have just said that straight up. Why did he need to specify the Immortal Realm? However, he had arrived after opening the sky, which meant that the Lower Realm had also ascended to become a part of the Immortal Realm. Since he had specified the Immortal Realm, that naturally encompassed the Lower Realm as well.

However, why did she feel like she was missing something?

“Why did you say ‘right now’?” she asked.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Don’t you want to hear about my experiences during these past years?”

An expression of curiosity and emotion appeared on her face. She had thought Ling Han dead, yet he was standing before her right now, alive and well. She was so delighted that she had forgotten to ask him about his experiences. However, she naturally wanted to hear about all his difficulties and exploits.

Ling Han recounted his experiences. He naturally skimmed over the events of the Lower Realm, not mentioning Liu Yu Tong, Zhu Xuan Er, and the others even once. Only when he started to recount his experiences in the Immortal Realm did he focus heavily on Empress Luan Xing.

These two were his future wives, and perhaps they would even make love on the same bed in the future. Just thinking about this made him excited. Thus, he naturally had to give her a warning.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was slightly displeased. This man was actually chasing another woman! Although he hadn’t succeeded yet, this didn’t change the fact that he was trying.

If she learned about his relationship with Liu Yu Tong and the others, she would definitely explode in rage.

Ling Han couldn’t help but praise himself in his mind. Slowly revealing his relationships with the other women was indeed the smart thing to do. Otherwise, he would definitely be bullied by this violent woman, just as he had been in his previous life. When he caught up to her in cultivation, he would punish her in bed if she still insisted on complaining about his other relationships. If he did so, how could she not submit?

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shivered, and said, “Don’t smile so creepily!”
