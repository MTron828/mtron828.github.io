Chapter 2612: Come!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han smiled calmly, and then rubbed a hand over his face.

“You!!” Luo Fuming raged immediately because Ling Han had already turned into “Li Long” in appearance, and his aura was also the same. Naturally, Luo Fuming instantly recalled the pain of losing his son. He laughed loudly, but it was filled with incredible menace. “How bold! How bold! You actually dare to appear in front of me!”

Ling Han smiled. “It was you fleeing in panic previously, wasn’t it?”

Luo Fuming couldn’t help but be struck speechless.

Actually, he had not fled in panic previously, but rather could only leave reluctantly because he could do nothing against Ling Han who possessed the Divine Demon Sword. But as a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, he actually was unable to suppress a Third Heaven Celestial King, so how could he bring himself to debate the issue with Ling Han?

“Today, I will definitely take your life!” Luo Fuming declared coldly, filled with absolute confidence.

Though Ling Han’s cultivation level had increased, and Luo Fuming was still where he had been, so it seemed like the scales of victory were even more inclined towards Ling Han, Luo Fuming knew just how amazing the means of spiritual attack he had grasped was. Even the mind of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King could be destroyed with a single strike from him in a moment of carelessness.

As for a Fourth Heaven Celestial King? Hehe!

He admitted that Ling Han’s physique was extremely tough, but the spirit was the hardest to cultivate. Was there any possibility that it was indestructible?

Ling Han clapped his hands together. “What I want is this resolve from you; come!”

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King should be the best opponent for him now. That should be enough to make his fighting spirit blaze, and allow him to break through to the Fifth Heaven.

“Pay back with your life for my son’s death!” Luo Fuming moved. He was shouting, releasing a world-shaking roar.

Even if one had attained the Seventh Heaven Celestial King Tier due to the special conditions of the Celestial King Graveyard, whether they were king tier or emperor tier, the cultivation level was still genuine. How could their battle prowess be underestimated?

Moreover…

Luo Fuming’s eyes turned completely black. He delivered a spiritual attack aimed directly at Ling Han’s mind.

This was the most terrifying attack.

Even if Ling Han had prepared himself, it was useless. He felt a great tremor in his mind. It really was like a great wave emerging in the ocean, shaking him harshly. Right at this moment, Luo Fuming’s attack also reached him. A palm strike approached, turning into thousands of streaks of force, and intending to render heavy injury to Ling Han.

Ling Han forcefully repressed the agony in his spirit, and repaid Luo Fuming with a palm strike of his own.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged blows once. Ling Han couldn’t help but stumble, and took a number of steps back. His expression also became extremely ugly.

In terms of true battle prowess, Ling Han was definitely not inferior to Luo Fuming, but having the latter send a spiritual attack right into his spirit affected his ability to counter, causing Ling Han to be inferior to Luo Fuming in this exchange. Moreover, the spiritual attack also caused some slight injury to his spirit.

A Seventh Heaven king tier was not fearful, but being influenced by the black Qi, he had learned the means for spiritual attack, making him now a Seventh Heaven monarch star, and that was what was frightening.

“Haha, you can’t even withstand a single blow!” When Luo Fuming saw that this strike had taken effect, he couldn’t help but laugh loudly. He approached again, sending out his fists in a series of punches, and multiple spiritual attacks were also embedded within his punches, bombarding Ling Han endlessly.

Ling Han was not shocked, but rather overjoyed. He had deliberately walked out to challenge Luo Fuming, and that was because the latter could exert enough pressure on Ling Han, allowing his fighting spirit to soar, and thus helping him break through to the Fifth Heaven.

Ling Han did not speak, and merely raised his fists to meet his opponent. The power of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll wrapped around his fists, causing his attack power to be greatly boosted.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them clashed again. It was clear that Ling Han was at a disadvantage. It could not be helped. Luo Fuming’s spiritual attack was not something Ling Han could block at all. It would be effective every single time, causing a sharp pain in his spirit, and thus affecting his battle prowess.

Furthermore, this kind of spiritual attack would also have an extremely strong harmful effect on the spirit, and after clashing several thousand times, Ling Han felt like his head was about to explode.

He had to think of some way to deal with this kind of spiritual attack. Otherwise, it was only Luo Fuming now, but what if he encountered Gu Heyi, Xiao Yingxiong, and the company in the future?

Sixth Heaven supreme monarch stars were themselves far stronger than Luo Fuming’s type, and adding this kind of spiritual attack, Ling Han would be completely unable to resist. Even if he broke through to the Fifth Heaven, whereby his standard battle prowess allowed him to be unafraid of Xiao Yingxiong and the like, the spiritual attack was still a barrier that he had to think of some way to overcome.

This Luo Fuming was his best sparring partner.

Boom! Boom!

They clashed endlessly. Luo Fuming naturally was unconcerned about clashing with Ling Han. He had the full upper hand now, and it was instead Ling Han that would suffer spiritual damage after exchanging a blow with him. Even if the damage suffered every time was extremely small, it would accumulate, and it was not impossible that it would build up to a point that Ling Han’s mind would just explode.

“Die! Die! Die!” Luo Fuming roared harshly. Being affected by the black Qi, he was already very bloodthirsty, and adding the grief after his son’s death, he became even more berserk.

Previously, Ling Han had also been influenced by the black Qi. He knew how the spiritual attack was used, but after expelling the black Qi from his body, he was no longer able to use this ability.

All that was based on the black Qi. Thus, the more black Qi one obtained, the higher the grade would be, and the more terrifying one’s spiritual attack would become.

There was no way Ling Han would absorb the black Qi. This thing was too malicious. It could influence one’s mind, so he could only find some kind of solution through Luo Fuming.

Previously, Ling Han had also repeatedly sustained this kind of attack, so it was natural that he had long since begun to ponder on a strategy to deal with it.

His original method was using the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to boost his spirit, but he discovered that this was completely useless.

Even a Heavenly Venerate Technique had no effect?

No.

Ling Han shook his head internally. Even Divine Metal could effectively block out the influence of the black Qi, so how could the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll be inferior instead?

This was because he had come to a new realm, where the various Regulations were different from the Celestial Realm.

After so many years, Ling Han had naturally long since made some adjustments to the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll so that the latter would correspond to the Regulations in the Flaming Frost Realm, but that was only in the aspect of physique. On the spiritual level, Ling Han still had not found the time to make adjustments, and it was only now, when he had become so passive due to the spiritual attacks, that he suddenly realized that he needed more improvement in this area.

While Ling Han battled fiercely with Luo Fuming, he continued to draw on Regulations, adjusting the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and strengthening himself in the aspect of his spirit.

It should be known that Ling Han’s opponent was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, a being who had grasped the means to deliver spiritual attacks. With him forced to multitask under such circumstances, his situation naturally worsened as he constantly wavered on the boundary of danger.

But it was precisely this powerful feeling of crisis that forced out every single bit of potential from Ling Han.

He discovered that the threshold on his cultivation level had loosened.

The great doors to the Fifth Heaven… were finally open to him.

Furthermore, this was not the only piece of good news. He had also reached a new level in his grasp of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and was presently rapidly adapting himself to the Regulations of the Flaming Frost Realm. After all, he had already adjusted his physique previously, so the difficulty of adjusting himself on the spiritual level was naturally considerably lower.

Come! Come!

He erupted in loud laughter, bold and lofty.

“You are already close to death, and you still dare to be arrogant?” Luo Fuming sneered. This brat was really prepostreous. He had already sustained several thousand spiritual attacks from him, and his spiritual attack was naturally injured heavily, and he actually still dared to laugh wildly?

Ling Han ignored him completely. If Luo Fuming had not grasped the means to inflict spiritual damage, Ling Han would have been able to kill the former with a few blows. Now, Ling Han naturally would not take Luo Fuming seriously, either. The other party was only a puppet that was being influenced by the black QI. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Come!” Ling Han shouted at the skies.

Come what?

Luo Fuming was just about to continue mocking when a feeling of anxiety suddenly rose up inside his heart. He raised his head, and could see dark clouds spreading out. Terrifying lightning bolts were flashing within.

F***, it was a heavenly tribulation that was coming!
