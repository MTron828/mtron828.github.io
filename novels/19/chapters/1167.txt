Chapter 1168: The Pitiful Gai Yongsi

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Gai Yongsi felt terribly aggrieved.

F***, it wasn’t him who had chosen to enter these doors; it was Ling Han who dragged him in, all right? How could he be so unreasonable?

Pa!

He had barely finished this thought when he was slapped heavily by Ling Han. “With such a bad memory, looks like your memory won’t improve without another beating!”

“Lord Zhu, save me!” Gai Yongsi hurriedly asked for help from that Sun Moon Tier elite.

That elite of Sun Moon Tier had the surname of Zhu, with the given name of Tianchou. Though he was merely in the middle stage of the low extreme, it was sure that even if Ling Han had cultivated the fifth Mountain River Tier to perfection, the former would still be able to suppress him easily. There was a gap of a whole major tier, after all.

His nose was almost bent in fury. First, Ling Han closed the doors in their faces, and now, he captured a hostage right under his nose. To what extent was Ling Han looking down on him? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Let him go!” he commanded darkly. There were multiple streams of frost entwining around his whole body. He was truly in a thunderous rage by now, and could not stop the Origin Power within his body from gushing out.

Ling Han laughed, and asked, “And what if I don’t?”

“In front of me, you have no right to refuse!” Zhu Tianchou took a step forwards. Boom, the mighty aura of Sun Moon Tier gushed forth like an ocean.

“Hehehe, take a look at what’s under your feet!” Ling Han said, pointing at the doorstep. “This is my territory. Without getting my approval, you almost stepped over this doorstep. Do you know what kind of punishment you would have to face?”

Involuntarily, Zhu Tianchou’s feet paused. This was a taboo that no one in the whole sect could break, not even if it was those few personal disciples of Venerable Trinity.

Pa!

Ling Han raised his hand, which then fell sharply, giving Gai Yongsi another slap. He had put great force behind this strike, and Gai Yongsi opened his mouth and spat out blood along with a piece of broken tooth.

Zhu Tianchou almost jumped up. Was this brat deliberately provoking him?

He had gone too far!

As the saying went, hitting the dog depended on the owner1. He was standing right here, just three meters away from Ling Han, yet this guy actually dared to hit his crony. How was that different from actually directly slapping him in the face?

Fu Liangye, meanwhile, felt cold creep up in his heart. ‘Could it be that this guy’s a maniac?’

Ling Han had already offended Yang Hao, and had now also completely offended the Gao Faction as well. Was he tired of living? But to become enemies with this kind of maniac... how dangerous was that? He was really afraid by now.

Why did he have to be this daring, acting as vanguard? Even if he’d wanted to watch the show, he could’ve taken out a stool and watched the proceedings from afar.

Pa, Ling Han delivered another palm strike, and Gai Yongsi once again spat out a broken tooth.

With the force in his hand, he could have easily broken all of Gai Yongsi’s teeth with a single palm strike, but he chose to break one with a single strike. Obviously, this was deliberate on his part.

Zhu Tianchou was trembling all over. He sinisterly threatened, “Let go of him, and I will spare you today!”

“Haha!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and pointed at Zhu Tianchou. “People like you all have something wrong inside your brains. It was you people who came to my place to strut around, and you are actually saying that you would spare me? Tsk, tsk, tsk!”

Pa, he slapped Gai Yongsi again. Poor guy, he broke another tooth naturally, which he spat out along with a mouthful of blood.

Gai Yongsi felt that he was really too wronged. It was Zhu Tianchou who was threatening Ling Han, so why was the one being beaten him?

But could he talk reason with Ling Han? This guy was obviously a demon king.

“Han Lin!” Zhu Tianchou felt almost suffocated with his fury. Pointing at Ling Han, he exclaimed, “Do you still want to stay in the sect?”

“Sigh, you are threatening me again!” Ling Han sighed. Pa, his hand fell again, and Gai Yongsi’s fourth tooth was sent flying.

“Lord Zhu, please don’t say anything else!” Gai Yongsi cried. ‘You guys are arguing, but why is it that I am on the receiving end of punishment?’

Zhu Tianchou humphed. Why did this guy not have even the slightest backbone?

True, if this guy had a backbone, how could he have possibly become Gao Huang’s henchman? It should be known that among those who could be accepted into the sect, was anyone not filled with soaring pride and self-confidence?

Even if they were willing to join the Gao Faction, they merely wanted to make use of the resources and network of the Gao Faction to enlarge their own relationship network. Which one of them would be extremely deferential towards Gao Huang?

In terms of background, the majority of the people here had Heavenly Body Tier elites supporting them in the background. None of them needed to be afraid of Gao Huang—the only difference was the latter’s Heavenly Body Tier backer was inside the sect, and he was also capable of coming into contact with great elites of Eternal River Tier.

But no matter what, Gai Yongsi was still a lackey of the Gao Faction. His being bullied by an outsider was a humiliation to the whole Gao Faction.

Zhu Tianchou moved, Regulations transforming into divine chains that moved to wind around Ling Han. He wanted to capture both Ling Han and Gai Yongsi and drag them both outside.

Ling Han snickered, and placed Gai Yongsi in front of him as a human shield.

“Ah!” Gai Yongsi yelled in pain. His body had been penetrated by over a dozen divine chains, and one had even stabbed right into his bottom, causing even purple veins to pop on his neck. This was really having a stick up his a**.

“Come here!” Zhu Tianchou dragged the divine chains back, but Ling Han had hold of Gai Yongsi’s arm, and would not let go.

In terms of power, Ling Han was definitely no match for Sun Moon Tier, but the crucial thing here was that Gai Yongsi’s physique could not sustain Ling Han’s power, either. Being pulled from both sides like this, he instantly released a terrible scream, feeling like he was about to be torn in half by the pure force.

Zhu Tianchou gritted his teeth. In any case, Gai Yongsi was an Immortal, so even if his body was torn in two, he would not die.

What was important now was to take back the hostage. Otherwise, as long as he was in Ling Han’s hands, the Gao Faction would continue to have their face slapped.

With a ripping sound, blood spurted.

“Ah!!!” Gai Yongsi released a pitiful scream. His whole person had been torn in half, but the larger half had still been taken back by Zhu Tianchou. Finally, he had freed himself from Ling Han’s control.

“Yo, sorry about that!” Ling Han said, grinning.

‘Sorry your sister! Do you have the slightest bit of sincerity on your face?’

If Gai Yongsi had enough power, he’d surely want to strangle Ling Han to death now, but because he did not, he could only swallow his ire, and did not dare to show even the slightest temper. He hurriedly took out an alchemical pill and swallowed it, channeling his Origin Power to stimulate the medicinal effects.

Zhu Tianchou’s eyes were cold and malevolent. He glared at Ling Han, but this was Ling Han’s quarters, so he could not move without the slightest scruple. Otherwise, if he even damaged a single tile, he would be in for a great deal of suffering.

He took a deep breath, and forcefully suppressed the flames of rage burning in his heart. He said, “Young Master told me to pass on a message. If you want to repair the relationship with the Gao Faction, then you must bring at least three drops of Thousand Source True Fluid out after entering the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm to be presented to Young Master!”

After he said thus, he left without even turning back.

Fu Liangye and the other person quickly followed on his heels. If they were left behind, then wouldn’t they only be violently thrashed by Ling Han?

“Wait for me!” Gai Yongsi could not bother with healing his injuries anymore. He was already so severely injured, and had no further desire to be beaten by Ling Han worse.

“This Gao Huang wanted to recruit me; most probably, his initial motive was the Thousand Source True Fluid, right?” Ling Han mumbled. “Something that even the son of a Heavenly Body Tier elite kept in his mind constantly, huh. What kind of treasure would that be?

“I’ll ask someone.”

He went back into his palace, and had Fan Ru guard the doors. No one was allowed to come and disturb him. Then, he entered into the Black Tower, and asked Notionless Saint.
