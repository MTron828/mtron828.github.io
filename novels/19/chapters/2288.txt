Chapter 2289: Another Group of People

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This time, regardless of what Holy Beasts appeared, and regardless of how powerful they were, everyone ignored them as they bravely marched forward.

This greatly increased their speed, and they walked out of the illusion formation in just an hour. A deep cave appeared before them.

However, they immediately frowned when they arrived. This was because there was already another group of people standing before the cave.

“Huh?” Upon noticing Ling Han and the others, the group of people also turned around to look at them. There were seven people in total, with seven men and two women. Moreover, they were all from the Demon Race.

“Why have you people come here?” someone from the group asked.

“I should be the one asking this question,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said in a solemn voice.

A demon stepped forward, and said, “Oh, you’re Celestial Maiden Yunhe from the Jiluo Clan, right?” Judging by the others’ reactions, this demon was most likely their leader.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe observed them for a while before saying, “Jian Hu from the Baoyu Clan?”

“That’s me,” the demon said with a nod. He exuded a domineering aura as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s expression tensed up, and she whispered to her companions, “The Baoyu Clan is a powerful Ninth Lotus clan, and Baoyu Jian Hu is more so a prodigy of the younger generation. Right now, he’s studying at the Nine Soaring Academy.”

“Nine Soaring Academy?” Expressions of fury spread across everyones’ face.

Around 1,000,000 years ago, You Yuan had been defeated by a freak from the Nine Soaring Academy. It was because of this that they could only place 72nd. Otherwise, the Hundred Battles Academy could have ranked even higher.

Thus, they naturally had no good feelings for the Nine Soaring Academy.

“Mn any case, Celestial Maiden Yunhe, how did those people also get here?” someone asked. This was a key question.

Even with a map, they had still gone through so many struggles to get here. If it were said that Baoyu Jian Hu and the others had made it here by luck, who would believe it?

Celestial Maiden Yunhe furrowed her delicate brows. After a moment, she said, “The Jiluo Clan obtained the map from an auction. However, they sold several copies of the map, and the Baoyu Clan also obtained one.”

Everyone frowned upon hearing this. The ancient tomb was indeed dangerous, but the greatest dangers in life often came from other living things.

“Oi, dude over there, are you trying to lose the face of our demon race? You’re actually teaming up with a bunch of angels?” someone said to Ling Han. Their voice was filled with disdain.

Indeed, angels were opposed to demons, and it would already be a good outcome if they didn’t fight. Mingling together was nothing short of a miracle.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “And what are you going to do?”

A demon leaped forward. His face was twisted with malice and rage, and he shouted, “F*ck, I’m going to kill you, you degenerate!”

Meanwhile, the angels beside Celestial Maiden Yunhe continued to chatter and laugh. They had their arms crossed before their chests, and it was as if this had completely nothing to do with them. First of all, this was an internal conflict between demons, so it indeed had nothing to do with them. Second

of all, Ling Han was far too powerful, so they didn’t need to help him at all.

Even Celestial Maiden Yunhe showed no signs of interfering. She simply turned to Baoyu Jian Hu, and said, “Control your own people. Otherwise, don’t run to me in regret afterward.”

Baoyu Jian Hu sneered in reply. He simply disregarded this as Celestial Maiden Yunhe making an empty show of strength.

Seeing no opposition from Baoyu Jian Hu, the demon immediately lunged at Ling Han. With a pressing motion, his hands transformed into a mountain of arrows.

Whoosh!

Tens of thousands of arrows whistled forward, yearning to pierce Ling Han and kill him.

Pa!

Ling Han casually swung his palm, upon which the demon was sent flying backward. He tumbled through the air, violently spitting blood and teeth as he did so.

“So you’re actually a monarch tier!” Baoyu Jian Hu said in a solemn voice. The demon who had been sent flying was a Fourth Severance emperor tier. Meanwhile, it was during the Fifth Severance when a monarch tier would possess the greatest advantage over an emperor tier. As such, it was no surprise

that Ling Han had ended a battle with a single strike.

Baoyu Jian Hu became even more infuriated. A mighty monarch tier was actually riding on the coattails of Celestial Maiden Yunhe? Was he trying to sink the Demon Race’s face into the abyss?

“I said you’d regret it,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said, adding fuel to the fire. They were competition, so it was best to shoo them away as soon as possible.

This naturally enraged Baoyu Jian Hu even further.

“Then let me experience his power,” he said with a humph.

Hu Niu leaped forward. Her finger was pointed at Baoyu Jian Hu, and she wore an expression of arrogance as she said, “Ugly bastard, Niu will destroy you.”

“U-ugly bastard?” Baoyu Jian Hu stammered with a stiff expression. He was a rare handsome man of the Demon Race, okay? It was simply because they belonged to different races that their perception of beauty was different. Anyhow, she actually dared to call him an ugly bastard?!

“Toxic woman, I can’t forgive you!” He lunged forward, intent on giving Hu Niu a vicious lesson.

“Who’s scared of whom?” Hu Niu was unfazed as she charged forward.

Peng, peng, peng!

The two people immediately broke into a battle. To everyone’s surprise, it was actually Hu Niu who was enjoying the upper hand. Moreover, this was a significant upper hand.

This was only natural. Hu Niu had originally possessed the talent to become a monarch star, and it was only because there weren’t enough Source Powers of heaven and earth, and because she only had the brand of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King that she hadn’t been able to cultivate a ninth divided soul.

However, she was still a top talent among monarch tiers. Now that she had cultivated the Regulations of the Foreign Realm, she had more so elevated her battle prowess to an even higher level. In reality, her true battle prowess was already no weaker than that of monarch stars.

How could Baoyu Jian Hu rival this?

The young lady whooped and shouted, and as she swung her dainty fists, she appeared as beautiful as could be. However, the might of her attacks was immense, and Baoyu Jian Hu was completely suppressed by her power.

After several dozen more exchanges, the young lady sent Baoyu Jian Hu flying with a violent kick. She obtained a flawless victory.

This was only a battle at the Severing Mundane Tier. If they had been at a higher cultivation level, Hu Niu’s battle prowess would have given her an even greater advantage. It was only after reaching the Dividing Soul Tier that the gulf between monarch stars and monarch tiers became more apparent.

The demons on Baoyu Jian Hu’s team were deeply astonished. They hurriedly helped Baoyu Jian Hu up before turning around to flee.

In fact, even the angels on Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s team were transfixed with shock. They indeed knew that Hu Niu was a monarch tier, yet they hadn’t imagined that her battle prowess was also so formidable. This kind of battle prowess was quite unusual. How could the gulf between fellow monarch

tiers be so great?

“Niu is indeed powerful!” Hu Niu said with her hands on her hips. She was brimming with smugness, and she appeared very beautiful like this.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe suppressed the shock in her mind before taking a deep look at Hu Niu. Only after a brief moment did she say, “Let’s head inside.”

They entered the cave. It was pitch black inside, and there was also an indescribable stench of decay. This was a pungent smell.

After arriving at the end of the cave, they found a large corpse that had lain at rest for heaven knew how many years. It was mostly decayed, with only its skeleton remaining. It was draped in a golden robe, and it was emitting an intense stench.

‘What kind of joke was this? Someone couldn’t help but say, “This is the ancient tomb? This is the ancient corpse?”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe shook her head. She pointed at the corpse, and said, “Move this corpse away.”

Everyone exchanged glances, and two people immediately stepped forward to remove the corpse. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Huh? There’s another cavern behind this corpse,” the two people exclaimed.

Ling Han also looked over. Sure enough, the large corpse had blocked the cavern behind it, making this place seem like the end of the cave.

Whoosh!

After moving the corpse a small distance, a powerful suction force suddenly appeared, and it was as if it wanted to suck all of them into the cavern. However, because this suction force was too powerful

Peng!

the corpse was pulled back, blocking the entrance to the cavern again. The suction force instantly vanished.

The two angels responsible for moving the corpse exchanged a glance before saying, “Come, let’s pull harder.”

Their eyes were slightly red. They had actually failed to resist the suction force and move the corpse... This was fairly embarrassing...
