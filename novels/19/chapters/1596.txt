Chapter 1597: Battling Han Qi

Hong, blazing white flames surged in Ling Han’s body, and there were seals of great dao throbbing on them.

Han Qi’s expression was filled with disdain. A mere Severing Mundane Tier clan... Just how strong could the celestial technique he cultivated actually be, then? Just look, those seals of great dao were not even complete, and he still planned to oppose him like this?

He was having delusions!

“En?” But he immediately discovered there was something off because the ice mist that he had released was presently melting, and the situation had returned to a tie between himself and Ling Han.

This...! This...! This...!

His face was filled with shock. His celestial technique had actually really been resisted.

How could that be?

The other’s seals of great dao were not complete, and even then, it was enough to oppose him. Then if they were complete, would he still be a qualified match?

This was the descendant of a Severing Mundane clan?

Han Qi was filled with disbelief. He couldn’t help but ponder. Actually, aside from entering into the Ancient Realm to train, he had another mission, and that was to seek out the treasures left behind by those Celestial Kings that had previously been defeated and died in the Ancient Realm.

...In that great turmoil, only a very few lower tier forces managed to leave the Celestial Realm in a “complete” condition, like Severing Mundane Tier. Above Severing Mundane Tier, every force experienced a blood purge. At most only a few minor characters managed to fortunately escape to the Ancient Realm.

Aside from them, there were the Celestial Kings.

The Celestial Kings were too powerful. Even if they were ganged up on, they would have some means to escape. But if they stayed too long in the Ancient Realm, so what if they were Celestial Kings? Their lifespan would still end! Though there were not many Celestial Kings that had fallen into the Ancient Realm, it had still drawn the attention of a great many clans of the Celestial Realm.

Han Qi was one of them. While he was training, he was searching for the whereabouts of the remaining treasures of the Celestial Kings.

He looked at Ling Han, and a guess rose up in his heart—could this guy have gotten the inheritance of a Celestial King? If that was not the case, how could the technique of a mere Severing Mundane clan be capable of comparing to him?

Haha, this was really a golden opportunity bestowed by the heavens!

He showed a menacing expression. He had really earned a lot this time. Celestial medicine, an exquisite beauty, a Celestial King technique... He had gained all three of these in a single go.

“Don’t show that kind of expression; you are having delusions,” Ling Han stated calmly. “You should be down-to-earth. As for what you should not think of, it is best not to even have the slightest thought of it!”

“Haha!” Han Qi roared with laughter. “You are really quite arrogant!”

“I’m just average, I am only speaking facts.” Ling Han shrugged.

“Then let me see, would it be your mouth that is stronger, or your power that is stronger!” Han Qi moved, and had already charged towards Ling Han. He shot out a punch. Weng, innumerable seals appeared, entwined around his fists, and a silvery river which was covered with stars appeared behind him.

He focused on cultivating the Regulations of Ice. As this punch shot out, it seemed as if the space itself was about to freeze. It was incredibly frightening.

Ling Han was unafraid, and raised his fist to exchange blows with Han Qi.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them exchanged over a dozen solid bows, and it was hard to decide who was the stronger of the two.

They were both at the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and had both grasped the Regulations of two Realms. There was not much difference in their battle prowess, either.

However, Ling Han’s brow was tightly frowning. In such an exchange of blows, he discovered that his physique was close to its limit.

It should be known that the power boost from the Black Tower only increased his cultivation level, but his physique still remained on its original level. Meanwhile, Han Qi had come from the Celestial Realm; the amount of cultivation resources that he obtained must be astonishing. In terms of physique, he actually also had a very high achievement; it practically could match Godly metal of the same level.

This was far inferior to the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, but it was extremely nature-defying in the present situation. He was practically invincible.

“Hahahaha, what right does a piece of trash that came from a small city like you have to compare with our Han Clan?” Han Qi laughed madly, his fists continuing to strike. He was aggressive in his attacks; he intended to defeat Ling Han in a single breath.

The gap in their cultivation levels was really too big; his physique was far from being a match!

Ling Han shook his head internally, and no longer confronted the other party with mere fists. He used the Lightning Sword Technique. Xiu, xiu, xiu, xiu. Sword Qi danced out, gloriously changing direction in the skies.

He aggressively broke through, breaking out of Han Qi’s barrage of blows. He shot out a fist, and Sword Qi turned into a flash of light that stabbed directly at Han Qi’s face.

“Ice Freezes the Nine Heavens!” Han Qi humphed lightly. The white mist suddenly condensed and solidified in front of him, becoming a defense that was akin to a city wall. On the ice wall, seals of great dao had appeared. This was an indestructible defense.

Peng!

The sword light landed, yet only left behind a small crack on the first layer of the ice wall.

“You can’t even penetrate the first layer of my Nine Layered Armor, and you think you can wound me?” Han Qi sneered. “I really have no idea where you have gained your courage from to actually dare fight me!”

Ling Han humphed, and used the Nine Heavens Flame. Fiery flames began to burn on his fists, and it was like that icy wall immediately melted like a snowball had fallen into boiling soup.

“What!?” Han Qi was astonished.

And that was not the last of it. The Nine Heavens Flame showed its might. Wherever Ling Han’s fist passed, one layer after another, the icy wall was instantly broken through by Ling Han like it was made out of paper, and he arrived right in front of Han Qi.

Han Qi cried out involuntarily and paled. What kind of celestial technique was this? It could actually overcome the “Nine Underworlds Ice Mist” of the Han Clan so easily? At first, he had thought that no matter how awesome Ling Han was, he would only be able to penetrate two to three ice walls at most, but he had never imagined that when that flame appeared, it would be like a hot knife through butter.

He had no choice but to retreat. That flame was too frightening. He had a feeling that if it landed on him directly, the Ice Element Regulations in his body would be melted completely.

Damn it!

This had to be a Celestial King technique, an Immortal flame that had been produced through cultivating a Celestial King celestial technique. Otherwise, how could it so easily restrain the Nine Underworlds Ice Mist? It should be known that the Han Clan was the ruler of a large three star city, and had an ancestor in the Immortal Palace Tier, who was an unknown number of times stronger than the Severing Mundane Tier.

“Nine Underworlds Ice Spike!” Han Qi’s figure swept out. After avoiding facing Ling Han’s attack head-on, he rapidly began his counterattack. Tapping out a finger, the white mist solidified into a spear of ice that stabbed towards Ling Han’s ribs from the right.

If this spear hit its target, even a great star would explode from the impact. It contained all the power and Regulations grasped by an elite at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, so its destructive power was indescribably frightening.

Ling Han greeted the attack with a punch of his own. He shot out a fiery flame that formed a Divine Sword that slashed out at the ice spear.

Peng!

The spear and sword collided, and red and white spread out. This was a conflict between fire and ice, as well as a collision between two types of Regulations, which caused even the world to become two different colors. Those Demon Masters managed to escape in the nick of time, but their faces were still charred balck, and icicles hung from parts of their bodies after they were affected by the aftermath from the collision.

And this was still because they had advanced to the Demon Master level. If they had only been in the Eternal River Tier, that one shock wave would’ve been enough to eliminate all of them.

Clang!

A sharp sound that could shake the whole universe rang out, and the sword of fire sliced the spear of ice in half. It aggressively counterattacked, and slashed out at Han Qi.

Han Qi grunted softly, and struck more than 10 times in quick succession. One after another, spears of ice shot out, and extinguished the sword of fire with their advantage in numbers. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His face was a little pale, but his expression also became incredibly serious. Ling Han’s strength had surpassed his expectations. He definitely could not underestimate him in the slightest any longer, or it was absolutely possible that he would be killed by Ling Han.

“Kill!” Ling Han growled in a low voice, and he dashed out. As his arms waved, he once again escalated the Lightning Sword Technique.

This time, he had infused the might of the Nine Heavens Flame.
