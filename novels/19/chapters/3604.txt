Chapter 3605: Who is more pretentious?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Though the flaming monsters outside weren’t very strong, they were still Mystery Realm Tier-level beings, no matter what. Yet, they were killed by the young man with a single strike, which proved that this young man’s strength was truly extraordinary.

It was at this moment that the young man slowly stood up. He did not look like a sixteen or seventeen year old at all, and his speed was very slow. After he stood up, he even carefully tidied the corner of his robes, as if he would not allow the slightest bit of wrinkle.

“Show-off,” the little loli mumbled from the sidelines, “He likes to put on airs , but if he shows off too much, he’ll be easily struck by lightning.

Yet the young man opposite them acted as if he had not heard anything. After he had cleaned himself up completely, he turned to look at Ling Han, and asked, “Are you Ling Han?”

Ling Han also agreed with the little loli’s opinion. This youngster was too showy.

Wasn’t it?

If he didn’t show off, then why did he have to sit on the ground if he thought it was dirty? Since he was sitting on the ground, couldn’t he just get up and pat his behind casually?

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Aside from someone as brilliant and mighty as me, is there a second person worthy of being called Ling Han?”

This was enough to show off.

The little girl rolled her eyes at him, and the sword-wielding young man’s eyes sharpened.

“My name is Zhang Qihua, and I have been entrusted to kill you.” The young man stroked the blade of his sword lightly, his eyes as bright as stars.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and asked, “Pang Clan?”

“That’s right.” Zhang Qihua did not hide anything.

Ling Han shook his head, “Looks like you won’t be able to do business on this ticket.”

“Oh, you think you can escape from my pursuit?” Zhang Qihua showed a disdainful smile.

Who was he?

He was the 29th prodigy of the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County, and he was also known as the beautiful title of the Flying Divine

Sword.

Ling Han shook his head, “No, no, no, how could someone as brilliant and mighty as me possibly be hunted down? In a battle of equal cultivation levels, I am invincible!”

Invincible!

Zhang Qihua was also startled, then laughed loudly. This was really too funny.

Someone actually dared to claim to be invincible?

The strongest person in the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County was Ge Tong, but he did not dare to say that he was invincible among his peers, because the person ranked second and third was not inferior to him. It was just that their battle merits were slightly inferior, and that was why he had been pushed to the position of the strongest person in the younger generation.

And there was also his twenty-ninth place. He believed that he could be ranked in the top ten, but he had been too low-key, and that was why he had degraded to his present ranking.

“A person who hasn’t even stepped into Celestial Path actually dares to have such big talk!” he sneered, feeling that the Pang Clan was really useless. They couldn’t do anything against even a mere Mystery Realm Tier.

“I don’t like killing people. Hand over the essence of flames, and sever your own arm, and I’ll let you go,” Zhang Qihua continued.

Ling Han smiled faintly and said, “Seeing as you didn’t want to kill anyone, I’ll only break one of your arms.”

“Impudence!” Zhang Qihua finally couldn’t hold himself back. He was a Foundation Building elite, so how could he tolerate Ling Han’s attitude? He charged out, and with a wave of his sword, shua, Sword Qi soared into the heavens.

Ling Han had no choice but to admit that this young man was indeed an expert swordsman. In future, it was possible that he would become a master of swordsmanship, but in a battle of equal cultivation levels – in truth, he was still one major tier away, but that was fine. There were also very few that could match him.

He swung his fist, which was wrapped in golden energy. Xiu, xiu, xiu! The Lightning Fist was activated, and he instantly threw over a hundred punches.

“Petty tricks!” Zhang Qihua smirked coldly, wielding his sword as he charged out from the fist shadows that filled the skies.

Ling Han shook his head. The Lightning Fist’s grade was too low. Aside from being fast, it was full of weak points. When he encountered a Sword Dao elite like Zhang Qihua, his weak points were easily grasped, and he directly broke through his offensive.

He immediately channeled out the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle. It was as if his whole person had turned into a golden divine bird that pounced towards Zhang Qihua.

“En?” Zhang Qihua was shocked. He had not thought that Ling Han’s offensive would become so fierce in an instant.

This was practically a completely different person.

Ling Han’s every move was swift and fierce. Though this young man was very extraordinary, and was very possibly a one-star genius, and had already stepped onto the Celestial Path, even if he was suppressed to the Mystery Realm Tier, he would definitely have some advantage, but in front of Ling Han, this was still not enough.

And this was still because Ling Han had not used any destructive energy. Otherwise, he could possibly end the battle in a few seconds.

However, Ling Han felt that this destructive energy was extremely important, and he didn’t want more people to know about it. Thus, unless he intended to kill, he wouldn’t use it.

This also caused the battle to become drawn out. Both sides exchanged blows, both of them attacking with all their might.

Zhang Qihua looked stunned. Though this guy opposite him was even more arrogant than he was, he was really very powerful. His battle prowess was astonishingly strong. He had to admit that Ling Han was indeed more proactive in this battle, and had a slight upper hand.

However, he was only a Mystery Realm Tier. Being strong in Mystery Realm Tier did not mean that it would be the same after he had advanced into Celestial Path. That was because the foundations of the Celestial Path that he had built were too important. How many prodigies had managed to leap over the Celestial Gate yet become mediocre?

Furthermore, he had not used his ultimate move. After all, he was an elite of Celestial Path, and had grasped a celestial technique.

“The falling flower has its will, and the flowing water is merciless!” His sword’s momentum changed, and he channelled out a sword technique that had a completely different style.

An illusion appeared before Ling Han’s eyes. Countless petals fell from the skies, filled with an air of grief and resentment, infecting him and making him want nothing more than to break out into tears.

But it was at this moment that a flash of sword light assailed. Like merciless flowing water, it shattered the petals that filled the sky.

Emotional influence?

Ling Han was surprised. This Zhang Qihua was really quite powerful. At least, that Pang Shu from before was not able to do such a thing.

Er, Pang Shu had been defeated by him right from the start, and did not have the chance to fight back at all, so this could not be confirmed.

However, would he be weaker than this?

A smile appeared on Ling Han’s face as he unleashed his murderous aura.

“Wu!” Zhang Qihua instantly groaned in pain. This attack from Ling Han was like a sharp blade that had pierced into his mind, causing him to involuntarily scream in pain.

In this moment of distraction, the Intent Realm that he had created was instantly destroyed. The falling petals disappeared, and the flowing water ran off to who knew where.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and leaped out, attacking aggressively.

Zhang Qihua roared in fury. With a wave of his sword, he once again unleashed a powerful attack, but this time, he did not even manage to create the Intent Realm before it was directly destroyed by Ling Han’s murderous aura attack.

p***i

He felt extremely aggrieved. Only a prodigy like him could create Intent Realms and influence others, but when he encountered a boor like Ling Han, he didn’t reason with him at all, he simply released barbaric spiritual attack after spiritual attack, making him unable to unleash his powerful strength in the slightest.

If Ling Han had defeated him with earth-shattering power, he would have nothing to say. More importantly, stabbing him from time to time like this made him feel sullen.

He had never been beaten so painfully before.

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!” he shouted loudly. With his mental state in chaos, his sword technique was naturally in chaos as well, and he was falling further and further into a disadvantage.

Ling Han attacked aggressively. Even if he didn’t use Destruction Energy, he was strong enough to suppress a prodigy like Zhang Qihua. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
