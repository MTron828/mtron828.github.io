Chapter 2153: Source Power of Time

Ling Han guided his divine sense to attract the Source Power of Time.

His brow furrowed in a tight frown because he discovered that this Source Power of heaven and earth had sustained serious injury, and gave a slight feeling of being close to death.

“That torn limb from the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate has been suppressing it all this while, and it has not been destroyed, because the Source Power of Time is too strong. If it had been any other Source Power, it would have been erased who knows how long ago,” Small Tower explained.

Indeed, just how many epochs had already passed? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, the Heavenly Venerable Tier was really strong. Just a severed limb was actually capable of completely subduing a Source Power of heaven and earth, and it was the Source Power of Time that was nine combined into one at that, and had further almost been destroyed completely.

Though destroying the Source Power of Time here could only strike a blow to the heaven and earth, and could not enlarge the connecting point between the two Realms, the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate was going to die anyways, so it was still better than nothing.

Right, the corpses that had just recently died previously seemed as if they had been corroded for several hundred billion years. Was it also because of the Source Power of Time?

The severed limb had suppressed the Source Power of Time, its insect poison invading the body. Who knew, it might have also brought with it some sliver of the Regulations of Time, making it seem as if a hundred billion years had passed once a person was dead.

Ling Han first tossed all his curiosity to one side. Now, the priority was naturally to retrieve the Source Power of Time. In that way, he would be able to gather all nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, and cultivate to the astonishing level of Dividing Nine Souls.

…Without forming nine divided souls, one could never attain the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Ling Han focused fully on stimulating the Source Power of Time. This was much too important.

Previously, he had gained six Source Powers of heaven and earth in a single stroke, so much that he was slightly numbed from it, and did not feel all that much exhilaration about it. But now, he had become both excited and nervous, filled with unease.

He definitely had to get it!

It was unknown whether it was the injuries the Source Power of Time had sustained that were too serious, or it was simply disdaining from giving him any regard, but it completely ignored him altogether, even when he was channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll—it was useless.

He was just about to come closer and make another attempt when the Heavenly Venerable Tier light that enshrouded him moved, and joined in the ranks of “promoters” on his behalf.

At first, the Source Power of Time was lazy and laid back, but all of a sudden, it became excited, and danced in happiness, as if it had met an old friend.?Xiu, a streak of light shot out from the ground, and headed towards Ling Han.

Ling Han could see very clearly. That was a living being that could not be described with words. It was as tiny as a fist and completely transparent, oozing the air of Time. It was as if it existed in the present, but at the same time seemed to be in the future, and simultaneously seemed as if it was in the past.

“Time is the mightiest power. If the Source Power of Time itself is not willing, even a Heavenly Venerate could not retrieve it, and can only destroy it,” Small Tower explained calmly.

And just as it was speaking, that tiny creature shot out, and sank with a flash into the top of Ling Han’s head, entering into his mind.

Weng, Ling Han immediately felt his body shudder. Indescribable energy was spreading out in his body. He saw the origins of time in the Primitive Age, and also witnessed the great prosperity of cultivation in the Ancient Age. Time passed, but the only thing that would remain unchanging was time itself.

He had an enlightenment that could not be described. He felt as if he only had to break through this barrier, and he would be able to ascend Dao.

“Tsk!” Small Tower suddenly exclaimed lightly, immediately causing Ling Han to come back to his senses. “Brat, if you had continued, you would’ve been dead.”

Ling Han looked at his body. Skin and flesh had all formed multiple seals, as if he was going to be refined by Regulations. He couldn’t help but feel astonished. That previous feeling was actually a test from the Source Power of Time. If he could not pass this test, he would be assimilated into the Regulations of heaven and earth.

To be assimilated with Regulations was putting it nicely. With his presently limited strength, how could he possibly influence the heaven and earth? It would be like a drop of water falling into a great ocean, and his only fate would be absorbed by the ocean.

Ling Han couldn’t help but exclaim at his good luck. If he had not had the Heavenly Venerable Tier light helping him, he probably wouldn’t have been able to retrieve this Source Power of heaven and earth at all. It had experienced the Primitive Age and the Ancient Age, and it was highly possible that it had existed since the beginning of time, and had never been destroyed. It was from the very “beginning” generation.

And if Small Tower had not spoken up in time, he would possibly have died, and disappeared from now onwards.

So close.

At first, he had thought that the Source Power of Time, which was nine combined into one, would be incredibly hard to retrieve, but firstly, he had the help of the Heavenly Venerable Tier light, and secondly, this Source Power of heaven and earth had been suppressed for more than a dozen epochs, so its injuries were too severe.

Thus, after it gave Ling Han a token test, it directly entered into his dantian, and began to compete for territory.

Though its injuries were severe, it was a Source Power that was nine combined into one, so its qualifications were genuine. Even with the other eight Source Powers combining forces, they only just managed to battle it to a tie. Thus, this guy managed to occupy half the space within his dantian, while the other Source Powers were all forced to one side.

Too overbearing, too domineering.

Ling Han used his divine sense to carefully examine. The Source Power of Time had turned into a small beast that looked like a deer, then a turtle, and then a tiger. It was endlessly shifting form, and seemed as if it existed in the present, in the future, and in the past, all at the same time. It could not be grasped at all.

Small Tower couldn’t help but feel rueful. “The Source Power of Time is the most amazing Source Power of heaven and earth. It is no easy matter for even a Heavenly Venerable Tier to capture it. It could exist in the present, but could also be in the past and future, and even a Heavenly Venerate could not possibly turn the flow of time, so he naturally would not be able to do anything to it.”

Ling Han deduced that this Source Power of heaven and earth had followed Xiao Gu’s last incarnation, but in the battle with the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate, the two great Heavenly Venerates had died together, while it was suppressed by the severed limb of the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerate, and almost destroyed.

Some truths could never be proven, and it only mattered that they could be rationalized.

Ling Han did not bother to get serious, either. What was the most important was the outcome, and the outcome was that he had obtained the ninth Source Power of heaven and earth, and had completed his collection.

All right, now he would aim for the ninth divided soul, and that Lin Xuan, just wait to be destroyed into bits.

“No!” Small Tower immediately said.

“Why?” Ling Han asked.

“Though the severed limb of the Heavenly Venerate has already been destroyed, the power of the Heavenly Venerate is still here. This blood mist can exist for at least a few more epochs, but the Heavenly Venerable Tier light that you have can be maintained for only a few more days at most. If you begin seclusion now… then when you come back out, how will you rush out of the blood mist?” Small Tower countered.

Er… right.

“Unless you can cultivate to the Ninth Heaven. In that case, you would be able to resist this kind of blood mist,” Small Tower continued.

This naturally was impossible.

Ling Han nodded, and then left this place. As long as he exited the range of the blood mist, he would immediately enter into the Black Tower, and aim for Dividing Nine Souls.

He did as he said. With a flash, he was already going back the way he had come from.

***

Lin Xuan was seated, his eyes closed slightly, but his divine sense had surrounded the whole vicinity of the swamp. No matter where Ling Han came out from, he would be able to sense it at the first instance, and then snipe him. He swore that he would kill this man whose threat to him was overwhelming.

Of course, he could only surround the outside boundaries of the blood mist. Naturally, he did not dare to touch the blood mist itself. Upon contact, his divine sense would immediately be corroded. That thing was too terrifying, capable of easily destroying even the celestial light of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

‘Huh?’

He realized that the initially calm blood mist was suddenly swirling, and then saw a young man stride out. His figure was tall and lanky, and an indescribable light was flickering on him, as if it was capable of suppressing the heavens.

This was none other than Ling Han!

But that wasn’t right. Why did he feel the urge to fall to his knees in front of the other? That powerful feeling of helplessness was even stronger than what he felt when he was in front of his master.

His master was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King!
