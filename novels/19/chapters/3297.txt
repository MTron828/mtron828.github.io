Chapter 3298 - 3298: Resolving the Formation through Violence

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Under the crushing pressure of absolute power, there was nothing that could not be destroyed.

Everyone was dumbfounded. They were engaging in a formations competition, and you destroyed the formations with a single punch. Should that be considered a pass?

Success? Or failure?

The referee did not know how to judge either, and looked towards those higher ups with a hesitant gaze.

This had never happened before, because the individual battle prowess of Formation Masters was too weak. No one could possibly break through formations with strength alone.

Yet, now, such a freak had appeared.

Vaguely, everyone seemed to see another person, a monster that should not have existed in this world.

Hong Tianbu!

“Outrageous!” A High Level Formation Master immediately said in displeasure, “We, Formation Masters, have to use upright and frank means to break formations, so what is this?”

“Brother Cao, I don’t agree with your words,” another High Level Formation

Master said. “The tournament doesn’t have any rules about what methods are

needed to break the formation. Since that’s the case, this is within the range allowed by the rules, so of course, it should be considered a success.”

Formation Master Cao couldn’t help but feel stifled. Indeed, the rules didn’t have specific requirements on how to break the formation, because firstly, it was a custom, and secondly, a Formation Master’s individual battle prowess was low. Who would use such means to break the formation?

He hurriedly said, “A Formation Master uses formations to break formations, is there any need to explain specifically? I firmly disagree. In fact, in fact, I have to propose that this person be disqualified from participating!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel annoyed. There was no animosity between them, so why were you targeting him like this?

“Since the rules do not specify, then it’s naturally allowed.” The second Formation Master was also determined not to relent.

More and more High Level Formation Masters joined in on the debate. Some thought that Ling Han should be considered a pass, while others thought that this did not reflect Ling Han’s abilities in formations at all. How could he mess around like this?

Neither side could convince the other, and the numbers on both sides were more or less equal, so it was really an irresolvable argument.

The lower level Formation Masters all exchanged looks, gritting their teeth.

So many High Level Formation Masters would actually fight so hard for the sake of a mere Elementary Level Formation Master. For this reason alone, Ling Han could be proud for the rest of his life.

Finally, everyone’s eyes turned to Chen Hao.

Chen Hao waved his hand, and instantly, everyone fell silent. He thought for a moment, then said, “Breaking the formation with force is indeed not in line with the purpose of the tournament—I’

When these words fell, the opposition immediately broke into a smile.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, Chen Hao was still speaking “However, since we didn’t clarify this beforehand, we can’t disqualify Ling Han just like that. Let him break the formation again. This time, only formation techniques are allowed.”

Even he, the Chairperson, had spoken, so who would dare disobey?

Only Yan Jun’s expression was ugly. That was because this punch had damaged his formation foundations, causing cracks to appear. This naturally destroyed the formation patterns, so how was he supposed to set up the formation again?

He had no choice but to report this matter to the higher-ups.

It would definitely be too late to recreate it on the spot. Thankfully, there was a Middle Level Formation Master, who was teaching his disciple the same formations, so he lent out the formation foundations, which was personally set up by that Formation Master.

Ling Han began to break through the formation. He strode in, and instantly, xiu, xiu, xiu, killing intent circulated, beginning to assail him.

He smiled faintly, not dodging or evading, and allowed the attack to come. How could a Meridian Opening Tier-level attack possibly hurt him?

He soon found the nodes, and then used Destructive Formation to cut off the power to the killing formation. The formation was immediately broken.

The entire process only took three minutes, which could be considered very efficient.

It was Ling Han’s turn to set up the formation.

With a casual wave of his hand, he still set up a psychedelic formation, and another formation was set up inside the formation.

Yan Jun entered the formation and began to decipher it. However, cold sweat soon broke out on his forehead, because he still couldn’t find where the nodes were.

After a good few minutes, his eyes lit up. He set up the Destructive Formation, but discovered that the formations were still channeling.

It was another false node.

He kept trying, but he kept failing. After more than a dozen times, he finally succeeded.

The fog dispersed, and he reappeared.

However, before he could even feel happy, the referee announced his defeat, because he had spent a total of forty minutes.

Yan Jun was dejected. His greatest confidence came from formations. Previously, no matter how freakish Ling Han’s performance in martial arts was, he had always thought that he would not lose, but now?

In his area of expertise, he had been ruthlessly defeated, his self-confidence shattered.

Yet Ling Han did not even cast a second look at him. What need was there for him to take such a minor character seriously?

It was precisely this kind of disregard that caused Yan Jun’s hands to clench tightly into fists, as if his veins were about to burst.

For better or worse, he was one of the three great prodigies of Huju City, and now the other couldn’t even be bothered to look at him, so how could he bear with that?

Ling Han! Ling Han! Ling Han!

He roared loudly in his heart, swearing to avenge himself.

Ling Han overcame many obstacles along the way, and it was difficult for him to encounter any opponents that could match him.

Although he was only setting up Elementary Level Formations, there were formations set up within the formations, and the difficulty of deciphering them was ten times more difficult than a single formation. In just an hour, there were extremely few people who could break through them.

When it was close to evening, Ling Han also successfully advanced into the finals.

The finals would be held tomorrow. Although it would only be Elementary Level Formation Masters that was competing in the finals, it was still the finals of an annual tournament, after all, so they couldn’t be too rash.

No one mentioned punishing Ling Han again.

What a joke; how could anyone bear to punish such a freakish prodigy?

Moreover, who asked Zhou He to have such a toxic tongue? What topic was the most sensitive?

The Demonic Beasts wreaking havoc.

Yet, you were still spouting nonsense about this aspect. Wasn’t he seeking death? Things were even worse now. He had already been exposed on the online platforms, and perhaps even the Holy Emperor, His Majesty, would know about this. Even if he didn’t die because of this, he would still be severely wounded.

Under such conditions, who would speak up for him?

Ling Han didn’t return to the academy. In any case, the finals would be held the next morning, so he wouldn’t have to make an extra trip.

He was only concerned about the prize.

However, this kind of competition was more of an honour, so the prize was not the kind that Ling Han expected, Treasured Fruit that could increase one’s cultivation level or spiritual power. Instead, it was an incomplete copy of a formation technique, and it was a handwritten copy at that.

Though it was an incomplete copy, it still possessed great research value.

Ling Han also found out who his opponent in the finals would be. That was a formations prodigy from the Windward City called Zhong Feiyang. It was said that he was really prodigious.

He was not concerned and just flopped down to sleep.

The night passed, and when the sun rose, Ling Han naturally woke up to cultivate.

However, it was a shame that he hadn’t been able to absorb the Purple Qi when he had completed his cultivation. This should have only be possible in the famous mountains and great rivers.

After eating, he slowly walked to the battlefield.

Today was the finals, so there were naturally still a lot of spectators. However, they were all Formation Masters and no outsiders were invited.

That was because others would not be able to understand either, especially if they were cultivators. They would only be looking and walking around, here and there all this while, and there was no fight. Who would be interested?

Ling Han took the field, and saw his opponent.

Zhong Feiyang was really a young man in high spirits. He was tall and slender, as if he was enshrouded in a layer of divine light.

“We’ll toss copper coins to decide who will set up the formation first,” the referee said. He looked at Ling Han first, “Do you want the front or the back?” “Front,” Ling Han said casually.

The referee nodded. He threw out a copper coin, and it landed on the ground with a clang. It rolled twice, but it was the back.

In other words, Zhong Feiyang was setting up the formation first..
