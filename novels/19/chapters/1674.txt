Chapter 1675: Revered by the wolf pack

More than 5,000 people diving into the mountain forest was akin to pouring a bucket of water into the ocean, completely negligible, what more when every single person still had to keep their guard up around others, so they naturally wanted nothing more than for other people to be as far away from them as possible.

Soon, Ding Xiaochen was the only person left behind Ling Han and his group, but after a while, this guy also disappeared without a trace. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Clearly, he had definitely not given up, but was rather lying in ambush secretly, wanting to grasp an opening for a sneak attack.

Ling Han grinned, and asked, “Can we run faster?”

Mao Shuyu was surprised. In her eyes, this was already the maximum speed a Great Saint could reach. She had even wanted to ask Ling Han and her companion if they should go slower. After all, even Great Saints could not possibly maintain this kind of maximum speed constantly.

Yet Ling Han actually asked her if they could go faster?

Was he being boastful?

Mao Shuyu was not a gentle princess. Her personality was a fiery one; she did not say a word, but her speed increased slightly.

After a while of running, she turned around, wanting to see where Ling Han and his companion had fallen behind, but she got a shock when she turned her head because Ling Han and the Empress were both closely following behind her, only about nine meters away.

T-t-t-this!

Mao Shuyu was really shocked. Though she knew that these two had extraordinary aptitude, one having two and a half stars, and the other having three and a half, there was still a gap of more than a whole minor level. How could these two possibly manage to follow her?

‘Are you both monsters?’

She was dissatisfied, and slowly increased her speed further, but she astonishingly discovered that Ling Han and the Empress were both following her with ease, still maintaining the gap of nine meters, which did not increase or decrease.

‘Where are your limits?’

Mao Shuyu finally gave her full effort, and increased her speed to the maximum. Suddenly, it was as if she had turned into a gale.

However, she soon discovered that she was still unable to throw Ling Han and the Empress off her tail. No, no, no, she was even unable to force the two of them to show the maximum level of their speed, because the two of them were still maintaining a distance of nine meters from her, but who could really say that this was their fastest speed?

Actually, Mao Shuyu could still increase her speed slightly, but that was with a secret technique, and she could only use it for a temporary burst of speed, which would be meaningless.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, the three of them sped quickly. Behind them, Ding Xiaochen was running madly, but the distance between him and Ling Han’s group was gradually widening, and he had finally completely lost track of all three of them.

Even in Dark Moon City, it was not peaceful everywhere. There were some Demonic Beasts that had violent nature here. They clearly had gained intelligence, yet still had a fondness for devouring cultivators. Thus, they naturally were excluded from the cultivation civilization, and were on the opposing side of cultivators.

These violent and bloodthirsty Demonic Beasts lived in such tall mountains, and were not completely exterminated, because they could be used to test cultivators, such as presently.

Occasionally, birds would be scared into flight out of the forest, and cries would ring out.

Sometimes it would be a cultivator being killed, and sometimes it would be the Demonic Beast that would have the tables turned on it, being killed instead. For enemies to meet on a narrow path, it was naturally the stronger side who would emerge victorious.

Though they only had to run over nine mountains, the terrain inside the mountain forest was complex, and it was very unsuitable for full-speed running. Hence, they spent a whole day’s time to finally arrive at the ninth mountain.

And there were Blood Shadow Wolves here.

“Be careful. Blood Shadow Wolves are Demonic Beasts that live in packs. Ordinarily, a pack of Blood Shadow Wolves would have a single wolf king, four to 10 guards, as well as a few dozen to over 100 common wolves. The wolf king and guard wolves would definitely be at the peak of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and the wolf king would be an astonishing big shot, and can be claimed to be a big shot among Genesis Tiers,” Mao Shuyu explained to Ling Han and the Empress.

Ling Han and the Empress nodded their heads. Though they did not take these wolves seriously, they did not mind listening to her explanation.

“Anyways, we can complete our mission as long as we have the tail of a Blood Shadow Wolf. There is no need for us to charge into a wolves’ den; we only have to find one that is all alone,” Mao Shuyu continued.

“Fine then.” Ling Han nodded with a smile.

However, their luck was very bad. Though they soon discovered a wolves’ den, there were as many as 100 members in this wolf pack, with no less than 30 at the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and the wolf king was even more frightening. Ling Han was absolutely sure that even the Blue Feather Saint King and Ouyang Taishan could not possibly be a match for this wolf king.

Firstly, it was because of the Regulations, and secondly, this wolf king indeed had very strong battle prowess, suppressing all other Demon Wolves.

“We’ll wait here, and there would definitely be a Blood Shadow Wolf that falls behind the pack.” Even someone with a personality like Mao Shuyu’s did not dare carelessly provoke these Blood Shadow Wolves.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over, and his eyes involuntarily lit up as he exclaimed, “Wife, look!”

He pointed at the wolves’ den.

They called it a wolves’ den, and it was actually very simple. A large boulder protruded, forming a sheltered space. The wolf king crouched high above on the massive boulder, its fur crimson, and appeared to be incredibly majestic.

Behind it, there were eight similarly fierce-looking giant wolves that were sitting like it was, and the other Blood Shadow Wolves were under the large boulder. Some were sprawled out asleep, and some were playing with each other.

In the deepest part underneath the large boulder, there was a plant that was thriving with growth, and they could smell its refreshing fragrance even from this distance of about a mile away.

“Saintly medicine!” The Empress’s eyes lit up.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “It should be a Great Saint Tier medicine, Buddha Heart Fungus.”

“The two of you should not be reckless!” Mao Shuyu hurriedly advised them. “A Saintly medicine may be good, but one should act according to one’s means. If we became targeted by these Blood Shadow Wolves, we would only be able to flee.”

It would not be difficult to stay alive, but if they were to be pursued by the wolf pack, how were they supposed to pass through the selection?

She had just finished her words when she saw the Empress had already stood up, and was walking towards the wolf pack.

Mao Shuyu paled in shock, and hurriedly planned to stop the Empress, but she was instead stopped by Ling Han.

“It’s fine, just let her go,” Ling Han said.

Mao Shuyu immediately glared angrily at Ling Han. ‘How could you be so heartless? That woman is clearly your wife, but you would actually watch helplessly as she jumps into danger just for the sake of a Saintly medicine? You are practically scum!’

Flames of fury blazed in her heart, and she secretly decided to keep her distance from Ling Han in future. Merely the sight of this kind of scum made her feel disgusted.

But she was completely dumbfounded with shock and stupefied when she saw the subsequent scene.

The Empress had already arrived, but not only did the wolf pack not attack her, they all crouched down instead, as if they were expressing their reverence towards the Empress.

This...!

Mao Shuyu rubbed her eyes, but the scene in front of her did not change in the slightest.

Why?

Her heart was filled with confusion, watching dumbly as the Empress plucked the Saintly medicine, and severed the tails of three Blood Shadow Wolves. Though those three Blood Shadow Wolves cried out in pain, they did not become hostile, but rather lowered their posture even further.

The Empress turned around, taking dainty steps, her bearing graceful. Even Mao Shuyu could not help but feel her heart throb wildly despite the fact that she was a woman herself.

However, Ling Han was very clear. Both he and the Empress had formed 10,000,000 stars before they had broken through to the Genesis Tier, and their battle prowess overwhelmed all other Genesis Tiers[1]. This was something that could not be sensed by fellow cultivators, but was discovered by the Blood Shadow Wolves that only knew bloodshed and slaughter.

They were bloodthirsty, and they also revered power. The Empress was a king among kings, and even the wolf king was as docile as a dog.

On the other hand, even if a Severing Mundane Tier elite had come, these Blood Shadow Wolves would still battle to the death.

Because what they revered was a true king tier!
