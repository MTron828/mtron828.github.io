Chapter 1346 Destroying the Heaven“s Sword Palace

Bitterness and terror instantly gripped at the hearts of the elites of the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

Their two most powerful defenses had been destroyed by Ling Han. The sect-protecting formation had been shattered by his punch, and the ancestral weapon had been brutally snapped into two. How could they continue to fight him?

They could only wait for death to arrive.

Jiang Qiaoling’s eyes instantly lit up. This uncle... No, this grandmaster was far too powerful! With his influence and protection, wouldn’t she be able to do as she pleased in the future?

“This is your final chance. The main culprits must die, and the others might have a chance at survival,” Ling Han said calmly. A Heavenly Body Tier aura instantly radiated from his body.

This was the suppression from a superior being. To say nothing of ordinary Sun Moon Tier cultivators, even those at the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier would be easily suppressed by him. After all, Ling Han was a six-star genius at this moment.

Ling Kongcheng glanced at Chen Jin, and as their eyes met, it was as if they had come to some instant understanding.

Xiu!

Ling Kongcheng suddenly lunged forward, killing intent surging from his body. However, his target wasn’t Ling Han. Instead, it was... Chen Jin!

This was far too sudden. Who could have predicted this?

The old man placed a hand on Chen Jin’s head, and coldly said, “Chen Di, if you want your ancestor to live, then immediately tell him to stop!”

‘This...!’

Jiang Yuefeng and Chen Di were both transfixed with shock and disbelief. This old geezer continued to lower the bar for his shamelessness.

“Di’er, save me!” Chen Jin was extremely cooperative, and tears streamed down his face as he looked at Chen Di with a pitiful expression.

This was an absolute joke!

Ling Han’s expression was cold, and he said, “Enough! There’s no need to continue this despicable act. Both of you are prime culprits, so there’s already no way for you to escape death. Why can’t you two die with some dignity?”

‘What’s the worth of dignity? Is it edible?’

Ling Kongcheng stared at Ling Han, and shouted, “Ling Han, this is the ancestor of your disciple’s wife! Yet, you’re just going to stand there and watch him die? Don’t you feel any guilt or shame toward your disciple?”

“Guilt your mom!” Ling Han was truly irked at this moment, and he immediately extended his arm toward them.

A deep frown appeared on Ling Kongcheng’s face. His threat still wasn’t working? By the looks of it, he wasn’t doing enough! He suddenly pressed down with his hand.

Pa!

Chen Jin’s head instantly exploded. At the same time, a human-shaped light orb flew out from his crushed head.

This was Chen Jin’s divine sense. There was fury and astonishment on his face, and it was clear that he hadn’t expected Ling Kongcheng to truly kill him.

However, before he could even open his mouth to berate Ling Kongcheng, his divine sense had already been grabbed by him. Without a body, how could a mere divine sense be capable of defending itself against an elite at the same cultivation level?

“Don’t force me to do this!” Ling Kongcheng shouted menacingly.

“Dumb c*nt!” Ling Han was merciless as he lashed out with his palm.

Pa!

Ling Kongcheng’s body was instantly obliterated. He had no chance to carry through with his threat.

His divine sense also flew out. After reaching the Immortal level, one’s divine sense would still be able to survive for a certain amount of time even without the support of a physical body. This would give one enough time to possess another body.

Right now, Ling Kongcheng was also reduced to just his divine sense. However, he didn’t charge over to battle against Chen Jin. Instead, the two of them suddenly started to flee in opposite directions.

Without the support of a physical body, one’s divine sense would become extremely fragile and weak. At the same time, however, the lack of a physical body would also give one’s divine sense more agility and freedom. Not only were divine senses extremely quick, but they even possessed the ability to fly.

They were going to flee, and if they possessed the bodies of even just ordinary people, they would be able to survive for several decades more. Whenever those bodies started to fail, they would simply leave and possess the bodies of some other people.

“You think you can escape?” Ling Han snapped his fingers.

Xiu, xiu!

Two arcs of lightning surged outward at an incredible speed.

This was the power of heavenly tribulation that he had grasped. Just how quick was the divine lightning of the tribulation? Could anyone in the world outrun it?

No!

Ling Kongcheng and Chen Jin naturally weren’t exempt from this absolute rule, and it wasn’t long before they were caught by the two arcs of lightning. There were two loud cracks as they were instantly fried into dust. Every single molecule of their being was blasted from existence. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ling Han strode around, his Heavenly Body Tier aura enveloping the sect and causing all the members of the Heaven’s Sword Palace to kneel down. No one dared to stand up against him.

“I’ll give you people half a days’ time. The prime culprits can kill themselves, and everyone in the Immortal level can cripple their own cultivation. From today onward, the Heaven’s Sword Palace will cease to exist. If anyone fails to do this, I’ll personally hunt them down and kill them!”

Compared to how the Five Sects had refined the beings of an entire small world into Realm Pills, Ling Han’s actions were actually incredibly benevolent.

This was because he didn’t enjoy bloodshed.

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said to Jiang Yuefeng.

“Yes, Master,” Jiang Yuefeng hurriedly replied.

Ling Han walked out of the sect, and Jiang Yuefeng obediently followed behind him. Meanwhile, Chen Di and Jiang Qiaoling were even further back as they followed behind Jiang Yuefeng.

They found some place in the city to sit down, where master and disciple started to exchange their stories. However, Jiang Yuefeng’s story was extremely simple. Although he had lived in the Immortal Realm for over 10,000 years, he had barely ever left his residence. The most significant thing he had done after Ling Han’s disappearance was founding the Cold Spear Association in the Lower Realm.

Traveling from the Immortal Realm to small worlds was extremely difficult, yet transmitting some non-living entities over was relatively simple. Thus, he was able to transmit his “divine intent” and found an association even through the barrier of the two realms.

Half a day passed, and Ling Han returned to the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

Most of the prime culprits were already dead. This was mainly because they had descendants, and they didn’t dare to test Ling Han’s patience. However, there were also those who wanted to test their luck. Some fled by themselves, while others fled with their families and descendants.

This time, Ling Han didn’t hold back anymore. He was ruthless as he killed all of those who dared to disobey his command.

Blood flowed, and a sanguinary smell permeated through the entire city.

Only a single day had passed, yet the Heaven’s Sword Palace—a force once dominant in this region—had already been wiped from the face of the world and swept into the long annals of history.

However, Ling Han didn’t continue to the four remaining sects. Instead, he went to find Yun Yong Wang, Feng Po Yun, and the others first. More people from the Lower Realm needed to witness the destruction of the Five Sects.

Coincidentally, Chen Ruijing had also returned not long ago. Upon seeing Ling Han, he fell to his knees even though he was still very far away. He was overcome by emotion. Meanwhile, the old ginseng and Rabbit had also arrived at this place. When they saw Ling Han, they both laughed and joked, saying that he didn’t have the appearance of someone who would die young and that they’d known he would be able to make it through alive.

However, Jiang Yuefeng was received much more coldly.

In the eyes of Chen Ruijing and the others, Jiang Yuefeng was nothing but a traitor. He had actually joined the Heaven’s Sword Palace!

However, with mediation from Ling Han, as well as Jiang Qiaoling’s cheekiness and persistence to call them “uncle”, the misunderstandings between them were finally cleared. After all, they had been brothers for many centuries, so how could the misunderstandings and hostility between them not be cleared?

Following this, they visited the four remaining sects.

The Cloud Phoenix Sect, Blue Thunder Sect, and Absolute Saber Sect were all razed to the ground. The prime culprits were killed, and the accessories to the crime were all forced to cripple their own cultivation. They wouldn’t be able to commit any more crimes.

Lastly, they visited the Earth Dragon Sect. The group of them charged to the foot of the mountain that the sect was built on.

Because they had already dealt with the Cloud Phoenix Sect, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden also came out from the Black Tower. Upon seeing her, Jiang Yuefeng and Ling Han’s three other disciples all called her “missus” in unison. There was a hint of obsequiousness in their voices, and the respect that they showed her was dozens of times what they showed Ling Han!

Ding Ping didn’t know about their experiences, so he couldn’t help but feel confused. Why were his four senior brothers so respectful to their master’s wife?

However, he did know that his master had several other wives who had been taken to the Celestial Realm. Thus, he quietly prayed for his master, wishing that master’s family could live happily and in harmony.

Anyhow, the Earth Dragon Sect was built amid the marshlands. Most of the disciples of this sect possessed the bloodline of Earth Dragons. Of course, there were also pure-blooded humans. However, because these people weren’t suited to practicing the cultivation techniques of the Earth Dragon Sect, it was incredibly difficult for them to become elites.

Right now, the main gate of the Earth Dragon Sect was tightly shut. It was as if the Earth Dragon Sect were trying to send the message that Ling Han and the others were unwelcome.

Peng!

The old ginseng kicked the gate open, and shouted, “Beautiful women of the Earth Dragon Sect, hand your undergarment over! Grandpa Ginseng is someone who cherishes and shows compassion to beauties!”
