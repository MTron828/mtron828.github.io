Chapter 3330: Aid in the Fists

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Who would have thought that after throwing a punch, a spear would appear in his fist?

This wasn’t high-level energy.

Ling Han saw very clearly that this spear of his opponent had not appeared out of thin air, but had rather “grown” out of his fist.

Are you a f****** monster!

Ling Han activated the Shuttle Steps and dodged this attack with ease.

Peng! The spear missed its target, yet it easily pierced through the wall behind Ling Han.

“Are you curious?” Fang Ziping smiled faintly, and raised his left hand. That spear actually slowly shrunk back into his hand, “The world only knows that Extreme Bone Tier elites temper their Godly bones, but doesn’t know that these molted bone scraps can still have other uses.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel disgusted, and asked, “This is formed from bone scraps?”

“That’s right. Because it’s shed from your own body, it can naturally be perfectly fused into one’s own body,” Fang Ziping said loftily, “Your own body is the strongest weapon!”

Ling Han also believed in his own strength. External power could only be borrowed or used like a supplement, but the fact that something that had fallen from his body was still used as a weapon and he even had to absorb it back into his body was something that he could not accept.

“Fortunately, Extreme Bone Tier elites shed bone scraps and not sh*t, or else…” Ling Han didn’t continue, and couldn’t help but shiver.

Although he hadn’t finished speaking, everyone couldn’t help but think about it. When they thought of that indescribable scene, they all shivered.

Fang Ziping was furious. This brat actually dared to badmouth him?

“Ignorant!” He dashed out. How many people in the Dark North Nation could use bone scraps?

This was also something that Hong Tianbu had found out from an ancient book after entering an ancient site.

What a superficial and ignorant idiot.

“I’ll let you have a taste of my strength!” Fang Ziping set off in pursuit of Ling Han. The bone spike shot out again, like a battle spear. Xiu, xiu, xiu, the tip of the spear flickered with fiery red light, and was still entwined with high-level energy.

Ling Han dodged repeatedly. He still didn’t know the power of the bone spear, so he didn’t dare to take it head-on.

Both of their speeds were extremely fast, both of them moving at twice the speed of sound. It was very difficult for either of them to forcefully block the other, and begin a head-on battle.

On the surface, it was naturally Fang Ziping who had the complete upper hand. It could not be helped. Was the cultivation level above Third Extreme still incapable of crushing a Blood Transformation Tier? On the other hand, it was truly inconceivable that Ling Han could last so many moves.

However, Ling Han was preparing to counterattack. Aside from stimulating high-level energy, his Spiritual Power could also stimulate flying swords to deliver terrifying attacks.

“Ling Han is truly astounding. No wonder he was able to get the first place in this hunting competition; he is actually able to battle against an Extreme Bone Tier elite for so long.”

“What level of Extreme Bone Tier is Fang Ziping? Why does it seem like his aura alone is enough to suppress me?”

“I already said, he definitely is stronger than Third Extreme!”

“Damn it, he’s already graduated, and he’s an Extreme Bone Tier at that. How can he still strut around in the academy?”

“Is there no one to interfere?”

On one side, everyone was stunned by Ling Han’s strength, and on the other, a sense of unity rose up in them. If anyone could charge into the academy and beat up whoever they wanted, who would still feel safe?

“Is it because… he’s that person’s subordinate?” someone asked bitterly.

Of course, not everyone could act so recklessly. However, Fang Ziping was Hong Tianbu’s subordinate, and now, he was acting on behalf of Hong Tianbu. If anyone dared to stop him, that would be equivalent to becoming enemies with Hong Tianbu.

That was Hong Tianbu, that freak that could suppress the heavens!

Thinking of Hong Tianbu, everyone fell silent. If there was anyone in this world that could enjoy special privileges, then Hong Tianbu was definitely one of them.

“Stop!” A cold rebuke rang out. This was a woman’s voice, but it sounded very child-like.

How could Fang Ziping possibly care? He was already at the cultivation level of Fifth Extreme, and those that could suppress him were only the Four Great Generals, Grand Tutor Hong, and a few other mighty figures. Who in the entire academy would be worthy of his notice?

Even if this matter was exposed, Hong Tianbu would still be able to easily settle the matter. Moreover, the Hong Clan still had a clansman who was the present Grand Tutor.

He continued to attack. Firstly, he wanted to subdue Ling Han, and secondly, he wanted to snatch the Spirit Diagram that Ling Han had mastered.

What he didn’t know was that Ling Han’s superior grasp of high-level energy was indeed partly due to the Spirit Diagram, but it was actually also because Ling Han’s Spiritual Power was superior to his.

Thus, even if he obtained the Spirit Diagram that Ling Han had mastered, his improvement would still be limited.

Shua, a whip whipped over, and with a pa, wrapped around the bone spear.

Fang Ziping pulled forcefully, yet discovered that he couldn’t move at all.

Only now did he reveal a hint of seriousness, and turned his head to look in the direction of the whip.

Three meters away from him stood a young girl who was only fourteen or fifteen years old. Her face was filled with anger.

“Ge Qiuyue!” Fang Ziping couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

“Get lost!” Ge Qiuyue shook the whip, and the whip instantly retreated like a snake.

A smile slowly spread across Fang Ziping’s face, and he said, “The glorious era that belongs to you has long since ended. If you dare to become enemies with my Lord, your only fate would be to be crushed into dust.”

“Are you getting lost or not?” Ge Qiuyue asked balefully.

Fang Ziping didn’t dare to be careless. Even though the woman in front of him looked like a young girl, her true age was close to 40 years old. When she was in her twenties, she had once been a legend of the Imperial Academy, leaving behind an invincible legend.

However, after she graduated, the legends naturally slowly dissipated, and added with Hong Tianbu’s sudden appearance, she was also largely forgotten.

However, this couldn’t conceal her strength. After so many years, this woman should have reached Fifth Extreme by now.

He wasn’t afraid!

An expression of pride appeared on Fang Ziping’s face, because he too was a Fifth Extreme. Furthermore, he had also learnt a great many secret techniques from Hong Tianbu. This was definitely not something that Ge Qiuyue, who had been enrolled in the Academy, could compare to.

“Ge Qiuyue, don’t meddle in other people’s business. Otherwise, without the Lord’s intervention, I’ll make you suffer!” he said.

“Good-looking?” Ge Qiuyue touched her face, and said, “I am indeed good-looking, so what need is there for you to give me??”

This… her illness of being too serious was acting up again.

“Piss off!” Fang Ziping roared as he charged over. He threw a punch, and the bone spear transformed into a bolt of white lightning that shot toward Ge Qiuyue.

Pa!

Ge Qiuyue moved, her whip leaving a series of afterimages.

The two of them fought fiercely, and it seemed like it would be hard to decide the victor for a while. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ling Han swept his gaze around, and saw Ge Qiuling in the crowd. He couldn’t help but smile at him. Ge Qiuyue must have been informed by him and that was how she could rush over like this.

Meanwhile, Ge Qiuling revealed an honest smile. This expression was definitely the same as Ge Qiuyue’s.

Ge Qiuyue was definitely a hot-tempered person. When she got into a fight, she would directly boil her blood and Qi, pushing her battle prowess to the extreme.

Fang Ziping had no choice, and could only boil his blood and Qi as well. Otherwise, with a power gap of two to three times, it would be very difficult for him to last more than ten minutes.

Ling Han saw very clearly that Ge Qiuyue hadn’t grasped any high-level energy, so she was at a disadvantage in this aspect. However, in terms of power, it was this young girl-like aunty that had an absolute advantage.

It was still unknown who would emerge victorious.
