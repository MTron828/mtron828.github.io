2855 We compete again tomorrow

Ling Han naturally was not afraid, and merely smiled slightly. “Alright, if you want a fight, I will oblige.”

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate looked coldly at Ling Han. “If you dare to step out of the city, I will definitely take your life.”

The two of them should be extremely close to equal in strength. If they went all out in battle, it was possible that the whole Culmination City would be destroyed. Though the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate was a Fourth Tier, he did not dare to cause such great trouble. After all, there were too many high-level Heavenly Venerates here.

Ling Han waved a hand dismissively. “Whatever.”

!!

This old geezer really did not know what was good for him; Ling Han just had to kill him then.

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate humphed, and left with a flourish of his sleeves.

His eyes were filled with killing intent. It was not just because Ling Han had killed the son of his old friend in front of him; he also coveted the Heavenly Venerable Seals that Ling Han possessed. This was just right; he could use this battle to kill Ling Han, and then extract his Heavenly Venerable Seals from him.

This old geezer… was venomous!

Though Ling Han could not possibly guess what was going through the mind of the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate entirely, he could guess a little. He sneered. Then he would just take a good roam around this area, and take away all the best stuff of the raw stone lane.

“Master, should we leave?” Fu Tianxing asked.

Ling Han glared at him. “What are we leaving for?”

He just didn’t like this brat, always exchanging looks with his precious daughter, and not acting reserved at all. He was really going to die out of fury.

“Father!” Ling Xi walked over, looking at Ling Han with a smile.

This was a gentle threat. Even if Ling Han had overwhelming strength, in front of his daughter, he could only admit defeat. He did not speak further, and continued picking raw stones here indignantly.

Without a gamble, he naturally could not be too showy. He only selected those raw stones that contained treasure and bought them. He definitely would not be cutting the stones here. If that happened, it would be equivalent to helping to advertise this raw stone lane.

Moreover, one should profit quietly. He could not show off here.

…Though he was already very showy.

As Ling Han walked, he chose all those raw stones that contained Great Herbs and Heavenly Venerable Seals. Actually, this kind of raw stone was extremely rare, even in the mid-grade area. He had only chosen seven raw stones, and all of them contained Great Herbs.

As for Heavenly Venerable Seals? Hehe, how could there be so many? He had really been too lucky to actually be able to unearth one from each area.

“Ling Han, do you dare to accept another gamble?” Just when Ling Han had decided to pack up and leave so he could continue tomorrow, a voice suddenly rang out.

After all, though Ling Han could “see through” the raw stones, Heavenly Venerable Tier divine sense should not be able to penetrate them in the first place, so it was actually quite exhausting for him as well. After looking through over 10,000 raw stones in a row, he was slightly tired.

Ling Han turned around, and saw that the speaker was Niu Buqun.

‘Yi, hasn’t he learnt enough from his last lesson?’ 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Haven’t you lost enough yet?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

Niu Buqun was indignant. Though he had lost twice in a row, that was all because Ling Han had been too lucky, encountering a Heavenly Venerable Seal every time. It should be known that even if some raw stone lanes opened all the stones in their stores, it would actually be impossible to have even one Heavenly Venerable Seal.

His opponent had been too lucky, and it was no fault of his.

Just look at his records; had his chances of coming out with treasure been lower than Ling Han?

Even a grandmaster of raw stone did not have eyes that could see right into the contents of the raw stone. With his standards, it was already quite acceptable to have found so many good raw stones.

“This time, my senior brother will be competing with you!” Niu Buqun declared.

‘Hmm?’

Only now did Ling Han look towards the person that was standing next to Niu Buqun. That looked to be a young man in his twenties. Wearing a smile on his face, he appeared very approachable and far less arrogant than Niu Buqun.

Yet you only had to take a closer look, and you would be able to tell that he was actually even more arrogant than Niu Buqun because even Niu Buqun could not stand too closely to him, and had carefully retreated around nine meters, as if he was escorting a senior.

What… great airs.

“Brother Ling, my name is Bao Fengyu,” this young man said, clasping his hands in greeting.

“Oh.” Ling Han merely nodded, indicating that he knew, and did not say anything perfunctory like “I’ve long since heard of your great name.”

This made Bao Fengyu slightly displeased. Who did not respectfully address him as “Grandmaster Bao” upon meeting him?

This brat was indeed arrogant enough.

“Hiss, it really is Grandmaster Bao!”

“This is the true disciple of Grandmaster Xuanlai, and his accomplishments in the field of stone gambling are extremely astounding.”

“It is said that he has once unearthed a primitive beast.”

“Is this true?”

There were still a lot of people nearby who had not yet dispersed, and when they heard Bao Fengyu’s name, they were all moved and astonished. They all approached to greet him, addressing him as Grandmaster Bao, and Bao Fengyu finally showed a hint of smile at this.

“This Bao Fengyu actually has some background. Master, you need to be careful,” Fu Tianxing said, drawing near him.

Ling Han was just about to toss a glare at him, but when he spotted the warning glance from his daughter, he could only reply, “My dear disciple, I thank you for your concern.”

He was almost spitting these words through clenched teeth. The daughter he had doted on and cherished for so long was about to be snatched away, and he actually had to force a smile; he really wanted to beat someone up.

He could not beat this heart-stealing thief, but weren’t there still two idiots here?

Ling Han set his eyes on Bao Fengyu and Niu Buqun. ‘I just happen to be in a bad mood, and you guys have delivered yourselves right to my door.’

“Sure then, we can compete,” Ling Han said nonchalantly.

“The rules are the same, the winner takes all,” Bao Fengyu said. “However, if you lose, I want to add another condition: you will return those 10 kowtows to my junior brother.”

Tsk, tsk, tsk. He was really quite ruthless.

However, this also showed how greatly confident he was, clearly assured that he would win against Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled calmly. “Then I, too, will add my own condition. If I win, I will beat both of you brutally, but I will make sure I will leave one last breath of life for you guys.”

Bao Fengyu couldn’t help but frown. He was not Niu Buqun!

Niu Buqun had just graduated, and had not opened many raw stones, so he did not have much fame. However, Bao Fengyu was different. He had already graduated hundreds of millions of years ago, and the number of raw stones he had opened was uncountable. Furthermore, he had also personally unearthed countless treasures.

...

To say nothing of low-level Heavenly Venerates, even Fourth Tier and Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates would treat him as a respected guest, and were very polite, which caused him to slowly develop an extremely arrogant temper. It was very simple; he had been spoiled rotten by their treatment.

This brat actually dared to say he would beat him up brutally?

Bao Fengyu was inwardly furious. Originally, he had just been convinced by Niu Buqun. Seeing as the two of them had been tutored under the same master, he had come here. If Ling Han gave in and took the initiative to apologize, he could not be bothered to be too forceful, either.

But with how Ling Han was acting?

Hehe, he was really outraged now.

“We will go into the high-grade area,” Bao Fengyu said.

Why were they going into the high-grade area?

That was because the winner would take all. He wanted to take possession of the treasures that Ling Han unearthed free of charge. In the high-grade area, there was no need to have very high appraisal skills. One could choose some good stuff just with luck alone. He naturally wanted to take advantage of this.

Ling Han waved a hand. “I’m slightly tired today. We will continue tomorrow.”

Was this guy afraid, and would be running later?

Bao Fengyu nodded slowly. “Agreed.” He had already made his decision. Later, he would command a few people to keep watch over Ling Han, preventing him from leaving Culmination City. With the social network he had established through these years of stone gambling, it was definitely no problem for him to get the help of several Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates.

...

He had heard that even the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate could not stop Ling Han, so there was naturally no way he would have Second or Third Tiers keep an eye on Ling Han.

“Then we will compete tomorrow.”
