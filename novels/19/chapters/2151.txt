Chapter 2152: Ancient Heavenly Venerate!

How many years had the Celestial Realm existed for? No one knew.

Perhaps those three Heavenly Venerates knew, but who would dare ask them?

In such a long passage of time, what would be strange about having as many as five or even six Heavenly Venerates appear?

“That’s not right!” Ling Han immediately said. “I remember that you have said that the most terrifying battle of the invasion of the Foreign Realm only broke out eight epochs ago, but this clearly is a Mystery Realm that has already existed since the Ancient Age. In terms of time, this does not match. Unless…”

Small Tower immediately continued, “…The Foreign Realm has long since invaded the Celestial Realm before.”

Ling Han nodded. “Why had this battle never been heard of before even when a Heavenly Venerate has died?”

“There would be lapses in history. This is very normal. If the battle at that time was too tragic, leading to the deaths of all the cultivators, it is natural that the tale could not possibly be left behind. Years later, the world of cultivation was revitalized, and produced a new generation,” Small Tower said.

Which also meant that over a dozen epochs ago, the Foreign Realm had already invaded, and the Celestial Realm of that era had managed to successfully stop them. Of course, they’d also paid an exorbitant price, but the connecting point between the two Realms that had been opened had also been blocked. Hence, a considerable number of epochs had passed again, and this connecting point was once again opened, leading to a new wave of invasion.

At that time, the Foreign Realm were invaders, but if the Celestial Realm had to pay the sacrifice of having the entire world of cultivation eliminated just to destroy the invaders, that meant that the gap in strength between both sides was extremely wide. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It should be known that in a battle in the Celestial Realm, the foreign cultivators would be hindered by this heaven and earth, and they would not be able to draw on the Regulations of this heaven and earth at all, and they managed to destroy all the cultivators of the Celestial Realm even then, so the gap in strength naturally could not be more obvious.

“Perhaps, the reason the invasion of the Foreign Realm ended in failure previously was because they had underestimated the strength of the Celestial Realm, and thought that when only a few epochs had passed, the world of cultivation of the Celestial Realm would not have recovered yet, and they became careless.

“But going by that theory, this time, the Foreign Realm would send out greater strength, yet there is one less Heavenly Venerate on the side of the Celestial Realm than the last time. Then, when the next great war breaks out, will the Celestial Realm still manage to stop them?”

Ling Han and Small Tower both fell silent, and felt like a heavy rock was weighing down on their hearts.

“It would be useless to think of these matters. I only have to concentrate on strengthening myself.” Ling Han immediately regained his confidence. He wanted to become a Heavenly Venerate as soon as possible!

Perhaps the strength of the Celestial Realm would still be lower than the Foreign Realm’s even when he became a Heavenly Venerate, but when he was qualified to join the war, he would at least be able to have control over his own fate.

“However, I still don’t understand. Why did this ancient map, or rather this Heavenly Venerable Tier skin, want to lead me here?” Ling Han stroked his chin. Was it just to see this furry and incredibly creepy insect leg?

“I understand,” Small Tower said suddenly.

“Hmm?”

“This place… contains the last Source Power of heaven and earth that you need,” Small Tower said slowly.

“What!?” Ling Han was both shocked and overjoyed.

“It’s not an ordinary Source Power of heaven and earth, but rather the most mysterious and profound Source Power of Time,” Small Tower said.

“Oh.” Ling Han nodded, not very concerned.

Small Tower swayed from side to side, indicating a shake of the head. “Idiot!”

“Any Regulation would be the same in Celestial King Tier, and there are nine Source Powers of heaven and earth, so what’s so different?” Ling Han explained his own rationale.

“Exceedingly wrong.” Small Tower shook its head. “Time is the most important Regulation of this world, but at the same time, it is also incredibly simple. Past, present, and future. It only has these three changes, so there is only a single Regulation of Time.”

“Only one!” Ling Han also became serious.

“There are nine of all the other Source Powers of heaven and earth, but there is only one Regulations of Time, which is equivalent to nine combined into one. Do you think that is the same?” Small Tower countered.

Ling Han nodded. The Regulations of Time should be the most valuable Source Power of heaven and earth. In truth, the Regulations of Time were also the most frightening Regulations of heaven and earth. Even in the Celestial King Tier, even if it could not overwhelm the other Regulations of heaven and earth, it was still incredibly powerful.

“At first, I thought that if you could gain the ninth Source Power of heaven and earth, that could only be Poison, but I never thought that this unique and sole Source Power of Time would actually appear here.” Small Tower appeared extremely stunned.

“Which also means that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had also not managed to obtain the Regulations of Time then?” Ling Han asked.

“Of course!” Small Tower had never been one to give Ling Han any face.

Ling Han did not take it to heart. He naturally knew that this was speaking nonsense, but to be capable of surpassing the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable in some aspect made him feel very pleased. Otherwise, he would keep feeling that he was just walking the latter’s path, one step at a time, and nothing had changed in the slightest.

He did not want to do that. He wanted to walk his own path.

“Then where is the Source Power of Time?” Ling Han asked, seeming slightly anxious.

Once he obtained the Source Power of Time, he would immediately enter into the Black Tower for seclusion, and directly form his ninth divided soul. Then, he would come out to beat up the idiot Lin Xuan.

“Since this map has led you here, the answer naturally lies within it,” Small Tower said, practically pushing all the responsibility onto the map.

Ling Han took up the map, and again poured his divine sense inside, searching for the means to obtain the Source Power of Time.

Weng, the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin exploded in light, and that seal released even more brilliant light. A supreme aura instantly enshrouded the entire Mystery Realm. So what if they were Eighth Heaven or Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings? Their hearts still shuddered wildly, as if they were faced with a great foe.

However, this aura was controlled so that it was only felt within the range of the Mystery Realm. Otherwise, if it spread out, it would probably draw a few supreme beings over.

For example… the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

Boom, that insect’s leg glowed eerily, releasing an attack towards the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin.

These two existences were both at the Heavenly Venerable Tier years ago, and while their owners had obviously died by now, the little bit that was left behind was still extremely terrifying. If it were not for the fact that he was protected by the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin, Ling Han would definitely have long since been ground into dust.

However, Ling Han also had a Heavenly Venerable Tier Tool. He only had to enter into the Black Tower, and he was sure that there should be no problem for it to just match the remains of a Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han discovered that this Heavenly Venerable Tier skin was actually destroying the aura of the insect leg. No, destroying was not an appropriate word. Both sides were more or less equal, and neither could suppress the other. Thus, they were canceling each other out.

The seal on the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin became dimmer and dimmer, and the flow of blood from the insect leg also became dimmer.

Finally, when a certain point was reached,?boom, the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin in Ling Han’s hands burned fiercely, and was instantly burnt into ashes, no longer existing in this world, and the insect’s leg also stopped bleeding. It rapidly decomposed, and turned into ash which dissolved in the waters.

Thankfully, there was still a streak of light on Ling Han. That was what the Heavenly Venerable Tier skin had bestowed on him before disappearing, which continued to protect him from being corroded by the blood mist.

Just at this moment, Ling Han sensed a different aura.

Source Power of heaven and earth!

Though each and every Source Power of heaven and earth was different, since they were all birthed from the heaven and earth and were manifestations of great dao, it was natural that they would have similarities in their essence. Thus, he could immediately confirm that this was the aura of a Source Power of heaven and earth.

It… was suppressed beneath the insect leg.

At the time, the Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm should have died together with Xiao Gu’s past incarnation, but before it died, it had still used its corpse to suppress the Source Power of Time, and Xiao Gu’s past version had taken the form of a layer of skin, which refined itself into a map to guide future visitors to come to this place to retrieve the Source Power of heaven and earth.

The two great Heavenly Venerates both went to so much effort, and this was proof enough of the importance of the Source Power of Time.

…If it was obtained by the Foreign Realm, it would definitely cause a massive blow to the Celestial Realm, and if Ling Han obtained it, then he would gain endless benefits.
