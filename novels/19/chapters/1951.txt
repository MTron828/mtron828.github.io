Chapter 1952: Asking for Advice

Ling Han simply glanced at him, and didn’t say anything.

This was his way of showing disdain. He couldn’t even be bothered replying.

The young man was angered. He raised his voice, and sarcastically said, “I’m Liu Xing, the ninth disciple of Xiao Lixing, Grandmaster Xiao. My respects to Fourth Uncle! Fourth Uncle, you’re not so arrogant that you’ll ignore your own juniors, right?”

Xiao Lixing was the second disciple of Grandmaster Zi Cheng. At that time, he had left for the distant Dispelling Cloud Heaven, and right now, he had already become a renowned grandmaster there. He had been invited as an esteemed guest to the Return to Origin Palace, and his status was now extremely transcendent.

Thus, this Liu Xing was naturally Ling Han’s junior nephew. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The three disciples of Grandmaster Zi Cheng had always enjoyed a close relationship, so their disciples would also frequently mingle with each other. Because Liu Xing was close in age to Zhu Zijun, and because their personalities were similar, they had naturally become very good friends. They weren’t distant with each other because of their difference in seniority.

Liu Xing had come here representing Xiao Lixing to congratulate Zhu Zijun. Because he had been caught up with some matters while traveling here, he had only arrived during dawn today. He had initially wanted to seek Zhu Zijun to chitchat and pick up girls, yet he discovered that Zhu Zijun had already left Guanhua City.

This had astonished him greatly. Even if Zhu Zijun needed to leave, he should have done so after the conclusion of the celebration, right?

Only afterward did he learn of the reason why. As it turned out, Zhu Zijun hadn’t wanted to leave himself. Instead, he had been forced away by someone. The perpetrator in question was none other than Ling Han, his new and unexpected Fourth Uncle.

Just who in the world was this person? A stupid brat wanted to become his senior uncle?

Liu Xing was a prodigy in cultivation, so even though he was still young, he was still referred to as uncle, senior uncle, or even ancestral uncle by many older alchemists. This was something that he had always been proud of and smug about.

However, who would have thought that he would one day need to refer to a younger person as fourth uncle?

He was extremely displeased about this. Moreover, he was also feeling extremely angry for his friend. Thus, Liu Xing especially walked over to obstruct Ling Han. As a junior, he naturally didn’t dare to curse and slander Ling Han. However, he naturally had other methods to humiliate him.

Upon hearing this, Ling Han took an extra glance at Liu Xing, and said, “No need for such formalities.”

‘F*ck! I never paid my respects to you at all! What do you mean no need for such formalities?!’

Liu Xing gasped in his mind. No wonder Zhu Zijun had been forced to leave by him. Just look at Ling Han! His tongue was already so toxic, so his heart was definitely rotten to the core!

“Fourth Uncle is truly successful for his young age. By the looks of it, Fourth Uncle is no older than 100,000 years old, am I right?” An artificial smile spread across his face as he purposefully flattered Ling Han.

The more he flattered Ling Han, the more painful his fall from grace would be.

According to the normal flow of time, Ling Han was only around 200 years old. Cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree wouldn’t age his physical body. However, after entering the Time Cultivation Chambers, the Black Tower could also accelerate time by 1000-fold. Thus, his true age right now was already in excess of 10,000 years.

This was reflected in his flame of life. Although it was still raging and extremely lively, one could still discern the marks left by time.

Of course, in the Celestial Realm, 10,000 years was nothing more than the blink of an eye. The age of elites was often calculated in tens of billions of years or even hundreds of billions of years.

Hu Niu glared at Liu Xing, and said, “Oi, your smile is so fake! I urge you to stop smiling. Otherwise, Niu will smash you into smithereens!” She still maintained her innocent nature, and she was as naive and innocent as a child... Of course, this was apart from wanting to have children with Ling Han.

Thus, she would directly speak her mind whenever she came across something that she didn’t like. She wouldn’t hide her emotions, and she more so wouldn’t feign politeness.

Liu Xing involuntarily faltered upon hearing this. Hu Niu’s aura was far too overwhelming, and just her glare alone was enough to make his hair stand on ends. He almost wet his pants in fright.

He was a prodigy in alchemy, but he didn’t have any talent in cultivation. He wasn’t even a king tier. Thus, how could he possibly withstand Hu Niu’s aura?

After regaining his composure, he purposefully raised his voice, and said, “I’ve admired Fourth Uncle for a long time, so I want to seek some advice from Fourth Uncle regarding some difficult problems in alchemy.”

Since they were conversing in a corner, others wouldn’t have noticed them before. However, by raising his voice, Liu Xing instantly attracted the attention of many people.

Zhu Feng was a Four-Star Grandmaster. Although the holy land of alchemy in the Eastern Celestial Realm was Alchemy City, this didn’t imply that there weren’t alchemists in other places. On the contrary, each place would have its own alchemists. It was just that 99 percent of these alchemists belonged to Alchemy City. Only very few of them were independent.

For example, Zhu Feng resided in Guanhua City. First of all, he could receive protection from the Universal Clouds Celestial King. Second of all, it was comparatively easier to obtain Celestial medicines in a Celestial King Tier force.

Thus, this kind of celebration was more enticing to alchemists. In the eyes of alchemists, advancing from the Fifth Refinement to the Sixth Refinement was a glorious achievement to be worshipped.

Anyhow, who was Liu Xing?

Many people recognized him. He was an outstanding disciple of Xiao Lixing. Even though he hadn’t practiced alchemy for many years, he had already advanced to become a Two-Star Alchemist. He had more so reached the Third Spirit Refinement, so he definitely had a huge chance to become an alchemy grandmaster in the future.

Even Liu Xing had to refer to this person as uncle, so didn’t this imply that he was a Four-Star Grandmaster?

They definitely had to seize this opportunity to admire this grandmaster.

However, when they looked over, they didn’t see anyone who looked like a grandmaster.

Apart from Liu Xing, there was another young man as well as four young women. Apart from being handsome and beautiful, neither of them looked like a Four-Star Grandmaster.

However, those four women were truly very beautiful. Their beauty was about to melt everyone’s heart.

Right now, Liu Xing... was looking at that young man!

Gasp!

‘That young man is actually Liu Xing’s senior uncle?

‘Is that even possible?’

Ling Han gazed at Liu Xing, only to see a hint of disdain in his eyes. He instantly understood that seeking advice was only an excuse. In reality, Liu Xing wanted to force him into a difficult situation.

As a junior, he could naturally seek advice from his senior. However, this was also dependent on the situation, no? Moreover, a junior couldn’t force their seniors to answer their questions. Whether or not the seniors answered was completely up to them.

However, Liu Xing had purposefully raised his voice and attracted the attention of many people. If Ling Han refuted him now, it was inevitable that he would tarnish his reputation.

This only seemed like a small matter, yet it was a clear reflection of Liu Xing’s malicious intentions.

“Fourth Uncle, you’re not afraid, are you?” Liu Xing asked. He laid another trap, preventing Ling Han from retreating.

He was feeling extremely smug in his mind. ‘You dared to bully my brother, so just see how I dispose of you! Moreover, I’m doing everything within the rules, so who can accuse me of anything?’

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Seniors naturally have a responsibility to explain difficult questions to juniors. What don’t you understand? Ask away!”

‘This is child’s play. Do you think you can stump me just because I’m a Two-Star Alchemist at the Third Refinement?’

Quite the contrary. Ling Han possessed a Reincarnation Tree, so his theoretical knowledge was extremely vast and rich. He was simply lacking in practical experience.

Liu Xing’s smile grew even wider, and he said, “I’ve been refining the Four Forms Bone Transformation Pill recently, and I’m slightly confused about the proportions of ingredients and how they should be used together. Can Fourth Uncle please explain this for me?”

Everyone shook their heads upon hearing this.

Just how many alchemical pills existed in the world? In fact, even Four-Star Grandmasters could only refine a relatively small percentage of alchemical pills. This was because mastering a new alchemical pill would take far too much time.

Ling Han was so young, and it was likely that he hadn’t even become a Two-Star Alchemist yet. Right now, however, Liu Xing was actually asking him about a three-star alchemical pill. Wasn’t he purposefully putting Ling Han in a difficult spot?

Anyhow, Liu Xing’s question about proportions was still okay. As long as one had read over the pill recipe before, this shouldn’t be a problem. The memory of Celestials was naturally very good. However, to explain the details of how each ingredient should be used together? This was far too difficult.

If one hadn’t mastered the pill recipe, how could they explain this?
