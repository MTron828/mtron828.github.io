Chapter 1497 Celestial Source Power

With Gu Daoyi’s pride, he’d initially disdained from using a Saint Tool to bully others.

He was an elite of the Celestial Realm, had re-cultivated for nine lives, and formed the Divine Fetus in his 10th life. Was that not enough to crush all the trash in the Immortal Realm?

But he did not think that way now.

Ling Han was definitely a descendant of a royal clan from the Celestial Realm. In terms of background, Ling Han was stronger than him by who knew how many times. Thus, it was natural that he would use the Saint Tool, wasn’t it?

He waved his sword, and delivered a slash at Ling Han. The Saint Royal Tool shone endlessly. This was the strongest existence in the Immortal Realm. Even if the Star Sand Saint was present, he would not dare take on a single strike from this Saint Royal Tool.

Ling Han was shining with brilliant light as if he was the god of sun himself, but the broken wooden sword in his grip was exuding demonic light, bringing out a sea of blood that overflowed the skies. Demonic patterns appeared one after another, and it was similarly extremely frightening.

Peng!

The two swords clashed, but did not release the slightest bit of sound. However, everyone could feel their minds shake suddenly, and almost had their divine sense destroyed by the tremor, blood seeping from all their apertures.

Only one person was exempted, and that was the Empress. She held the Absolute Beginning Stone which could absorb all attack in her grip. Only power that had reached the Genesis Tier could possibly cause actual damage to it.

However, neither Gu Daoyi nor Ling Han were of the Genesis Tier, so they could not possibly make the treasured tool in their possession show the true saintly might, and there was naturally no effect on her.

The two swords crashed into one another, and Ling Han and Gu Daoyi were also looking each other in the eye. They were less than a foot away from each other, and were so close to each other that the air they exhaled was hitting each other’s faces.

“Humph!” While Gu Daoyi’s right hand wielded the sword, his left hand formed a claw, and he swiped at Ling Han. The bodies of nine lives also moved respectively, attacking Ling Han simultaneously.

Ling Han was unafraid, and the Sun Physique shone with endless divine light.

This was a Sun Physique that had reached Great Accomplishment level. Even if it was not a match for the Divine Fetus, it was inferior only to the Divine Fetus itself; how could it be that it would not be a match for the bodies of nine lives, either? Moreover, the bodies of nine lives were not true living beings, after all, and were only battle doppelgangers that been summoned with a secret technique.

Boom, as the Sun Physique burned, all bodies of nine lives released a muffled grunt; their eyes had all been blinded by the burn.

Gu Daoyi involuntarily released an enraged roar. The bodies of nine lives were naturally all done for. They could not possibly suffer any actual damage, but now that they had suffered burn wounds, they could not possibly recover, at least not immediately. Thus, his battle prowess had naturally declined tremendously.

Damn it, this was a benefit that he had gained from the golden floating rock. If he was the one who had gained it, with the Divine Fetus added with the Sun Physique... tsk!

His left hand attacked continuously, filled with his hatred and jealousy.

Ling Han did not cower. His left hand clenched into a fist, he counterattacked.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Their two swords were still held against one another. Divine patterns and demonic patterns shone endlessly, and it was hard to decide who would be winning at this moment in time. Meanwhile, their left hands were delivering continuous attacks towards each other, exploding with chaotic light.

A Divine Fetus was truly extraordinary. If it was any other person, and he dared to exchange blows at such close quarters with Ling Han, all the bones in his body would be shattered quite quickly, but Gu Daoyi survived all the blows.

It was not his physique that was astonishing, but rather the extraordinary nature of his Divine Fetus. He could disperse the power that he consumed, just like a true Celestial, untouched by the dust of a lower realm.

“Hahahaha, Ling Han, your physique may be strong, but how could my Divine Fetus lose to you!” Gu Daoyi smirked. Your physique was awesome, but his strength lay in his constitution.

“Is that right?” A thought flashed in Ling Han’s heart, and the Nine Heavens Flame emerged.

It had been reserved to deal with Gu Daoyi in the first place. True enough, even the 10 killing formations merged as one were not able to defeat the latter, and he had to use his strongest attack.

The Nine Heavens Flame, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Flames of the Celestial Realm. ‘What Divine Fetus, let’s see if this will burn you to death!’

Boom, a layer of flames wrapped around Ling Han’s fist. It was very thin, no thicker than half an inch, and just barely managed to wrap around his fist. It was colorless, but the burning air allowed one to see the outline of the flames.

Gu Daoyi felt all the hair on his body stand on ends in that one instant. The Divine Fetus was sensitive and could sense danger, causing his heart to clench. He hurriedly withdrew his sword and retreated. Putting aside actually sustaining a punch from Ling Han, he did not even dare take it head-on.

“This, this is...” He stared at Ling Han’s left fist, but even if he had been a Severing Mundane elder in his first life, he did not recognize what kind of flame that was at all. He only knew that he definitely did not want to be touched by it.

He might have heard of the ancestral flames, but had not been worthy of seeing them before, what more getting in contact with them.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Why are you being so shy? Come, you’ll know once you’ve gotten a taste of them.”

‘Taste? F***!’

Gu Daoyi was ridiculing inwardly. When one had reached a height like he, his instincts were never wrong, especially when it concerned danger. This flame could burn all, and turn even his Divine Fetus into ash.

He humphed, and brandished his sword in a slash. ‘My physical body dares not touch your flames, but how could it be that your physical body dares sustain a single blow from my Saint Royal Tool?’

Ling Han waved the broken wooden sword to parry. Now, Gu Daoyi did not use physical blows to compete with him, and was merely attacking with his sword, so he did not dare to extend his fists, either. After all, it was no joke to take a strike from a Saint Royal Tool. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He waited for an opening. After all, as long as one was attacking, they would definitely be left open, and by then, he only had to shoot forth his fist in a punch.

The bodies of nine lives were still attacking. However, their eyes had been blinded, and they could only confirm the location of their target with instructions from the original. This naturally caused them to be slightly slower. In a clash of this level, being slightly slower was actually no different than being completely useless.

Ling Han completely disregarded the presence of these nine beings, the wooden sword continuously clashing against the Saint Royal Tool, and then punched out with his fist. The Nine Heavens Flame showed its might, and even if his attack had not directly landed on Gu Daoyi, merely that burning heat was enough to burn off all Gu Daoyi’s hair and eyebrows.

Gu Daoyi was a Divine Fetus. Initially, he looked handsome and great, and was so charismatic that even Ling Han and Zi Chenfeng were far from matching him. But now, with a completely bald head and his eyebrows burned off, he suddenly became incredibly strange-looking.

“Damn you! Damn you!” he shouted. Although he was not concerned about looks, who would be willing to show others an ugly image of themselves?

And what made him more apprehensive was the fact that his first mouthful of Celestial Source Power was close to being completely used up.

He had to end the battle as soon as battle, he thought, but the problem was that merely thinking that was of no use.

He had used all his powerful moves, the bodies of nine lives, the Divine Fetus, the Saint Royal Tool, and the Celestial Source Power. He had thrown out so many trump cards, and still had not succeeded. What else could he do?

“Still not admitting defeat?” Ling Han laughed loudly. In truth, he was more willing to beat Gu Daoyi to death, but who asked him to have just broken through, and thus yet to inscribe Level 15 killing formations? Then, he could only be satisfied with winning today.

In any case, killing him would not be permitted under the conditions today. When he inscribed Level 15 killing formations in future, he would kill this guy, and hand the Divine Fetus over to his wife to be refined. Then he could finally move his great undertaking of pushing down the Empress up the schedule. Just the mere thought of it made him slightly excited.

Gu Daoyi did not speak. In this present situation, it was true that he was at a disadvantage, but as long as the battle had not been concluded, it was possible that an astonishing turn of events could happen. For a king tier like himself, his will was strong, and he would definitely not surrender until the last moment.

However, who among the gathered masses wasn’t a king tier as well? How could it be that they could not tell how the scales were tipped now?

“I never imagined that Gu Daoyi would be about to lose!”

“He is claimed to be the greatest prodigy of all eternity, and in a battle of equals, he should be able to sweep aside all opposition and be invincible!”

“Which clearly means that natural talent does not represent everything.”

“We... have the chance to become the strongest too!”

Ling Han’s powerful counterattack caused everyone’s fighting spirit to burn bright.
