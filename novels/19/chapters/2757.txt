Here was the thing.

Ling Feifan was a person with a flamboyant personality. He wasn’t as suave and steady as Ling Jianxue; he was more like Ling Han, with his abilities being displayed to the full extent, and was more likely to cause trouble.

As a matter of fact, he had gotten into a fight with another First Heaven Celestial King because of a trivial matter. The two fought, and the other party lost. In the end, that person turned out to be the younger brother of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, which directly provoked this elite to make a move against him.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In the first place, how could a fight with a First Heaven Celestial King draw out an elite of the Ninth Heaven?

This responsibility had to be borne by Ling Han.

The reason was that this Ninth Heaven Celestial King… was called Yu Wudi!

The Yu Clan and Ling Han were old enemies, so when Yu Wudi heard that this person was surnamed Ling, he couldn’t help but beat up Ling Feifan without so much as an explanation.

It stood to reason that it was strictly prohibited for Celestial Kings of higher cultivation level to make a move against those at a lower cultivation level within the Martial Academy, unless the gap was within two cultivation levels.

Yu Wudi dared to do this because his father, the Imperial Void Celestial King, had not only become a Heavenly Venerate, but had also advanced to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

…The Imperial Void Celestial King had already been near to becoming a Heavenly Venerate in the Celestial Realm back then, so all he had needed had been more time or perhaps a little chance. After coming to the Flaming Frost Realm, the cultivation environment here was sufficiently conducive, and in addition to that, he had had the time frame of an epoch that had allowed him to take such a step forward.

He was extraordinary indeed, and after so many years, he had successfully taken the next step to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Having his father who had successfully become a Heavenly Venerate, Yu Wudi was certainly able to be arrogant. He had not attained a perfect Celestial Seed—in fact, this was just a scam, and the chance of him becoming a Heavenly Venerate was extremely slim—so he wanted to become a ruler, acting as an overlord in this place.

Just because Ling Feifan was surnamed Ling, Yu Wudi attacked and seriously wounded Ling Feifan, for no other reason than him being unhappy with the surname, though he was actually hitting the right person.

When Ling Jianxue found out about it, he went to find Yu Wudi to talk some sense into him, but… a fight broke out between them as well.

Ling Jianxue wasn’t weaker than Yu Wudi. Unfortunately, Yu Wudi had been operating here for many years, and he had many friends who were of Ninth Heaven. When these people attacked together, Ling Jianxue was naturally defeated, and was also seriously wounded.

It was just that simple.

Ling Han’s expression darkened. Did Yu Wudi think Ling Han was dead, daring to bully his son and grandson like this?

Furthermore, this was Yu Wudi not having known the father and son relationship between Ling Han and Ling Jianxue; otherwise, he might not have just dealt a heavy blow, but a deadly one.

Oh, Ling Han hadn’t killed anyone in an epoch, so everyone had forgotten about his existence, right?

Fine then, he would go kill someone!

Ling Han said to Chen Shuangshuang, “Take care of the two of them, I’m going to kill someone.”

Chen Shuangshuang couldn’t help but feel moved; she never knew that she would have the urge to shed tears when she heard the words “kill someone.”

This was the Martial Academy, after all, with strict rules and regulations, which were set by the Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han, on the other hand, did not hesitate to kill. This was a father’s expression of anger and love.

The Martial Academy was a huge place, but to Ling Han, it was actually very small. He took one step after another for 30 minutes, and he swiftly arrived at the peak of the mountain where the abode of Yu Wudi was located.

If the Martial Academy had promptly come forward to severely punish Yu Wudi after Ling Feifan had been beaten, and the matter had been handled fairly, then Ling Han would not have had to break the rules. However, there was still no movement from the Martial Academy up until now, so Ling Han was outraged.

Since the Martial Academy took no heed of the matter, then this father couldn’t be blamed for taking action himself.

Ling Han ascended the mountain step by step, and soon arrived on the peak of the mountain.

There were guards in front of the abode, and one immediately shouted at Ling Han, “Who are you?”

He was a Third Heaven Celestial King, so it was naturally impossible for Ling Han to have any regard for him. However, Ling Han didn’t make a habit of killing innocent people indiscriminately, so he said, “Call Yu Wudi out, I want to settle accounts with him.”

“How dare you!!” the Third Heaven Celestial King immediately reprimanded.

Ling Han shook his head as he sent out a palm strike, and pressed forward.

His palm strike appeared light as a feather, as if there wasn’t any force behind it, so the Third Heaven Celestial King was also unafraid, and countered Ling Han with a punch.

Peng, he was sent flying as soon as the palm strike made contact, and all the bones in his body were shattered. However, Ling Han was merciful after all, and didn’t smash him to death.

The power of the strike didn’t just stop there, as it blasted the mountain peak with a loud noise, and Yu Wudi’s abode was instantly flattened.

Xiu, a figure flew out and stood upright in the sky.

It was precisely Yu Wudi, with his black hair fluttering in the winds. He bore an extremely angry expression. Someone actually dared to bombard his abode; wasn’t that too outrageously bold of a move?

“Who are you?” he shouted at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. “So you don’t recognize me?”

Yu Wudi stared at Ling Han, and felt that Ling Han looked somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t remember who he was for a short while.

After all, Ling Han had been cultivating hard for the last epoch, which had greatly changed his demeanor and temperament. In addition to that, Yu Wudi thought that Ling Han was dead, so how could he have considered this person to be Ling Han?

However, he bore a deep hatred for Ling Han after all. After a few more glances, he couldn’t help but gasp, and clenched his teeth as he exclaimed, “Ling… Han!”

“You recognize me now?” Ling Han said lightly.

“You actually didn’t die!” Yu Wudi said bitterly. Back then, Yu Wudi had been defeated by Ling Han, and had had to break through to the Celestial King Tier ahead of time. Then, after coming to the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, Ling Han had created one legend after another, which Yu Wudi could only look up to.

It was originally thought that, having made no appearance in one epoch, Ling Han had already died in the process of advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, but he unexpectedly reappeared.

Ling Han nodded. “Of the two people whom you injured today, one is my son, and the other is my grandson, so I came here to settle accounts with you.”

Yu Wudi was taken aback for a moment, and then sneered. “If I had known earlier, I should have dealt more severe blows!” He was very pleased. He had failed to gain the upper hand over Ling Han, but he’d managed to get rid of his enemy’s offspring.

That was awesome! Too awesome!

He looked at Ling Han, with the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. “Now that they’ve been beaten, what can you do?”

“Kill you!” Ling Han said in a very calm tone.

“Ha, this is the Martial Academy; do you dare to make a move?” Yu Wudi was not afraid in the least.

Ling Han stopped talking, moved his feet, and walked towards Yu Wudi.

“You dare!!” Yu Wudi made a move, and boom, he grabbed a streak of great dao and lashed with it towards Ling Han.

Peng, the great dao hit Ling Han’s body, but there was not even the slightest impact. Ling Han stretched out his hand, grabbed Yu Wudi’s neck, and lifted him up like a chicken.

It was an extremely simple move.

Yu Wudi was struggling and moving his limbs about as his face was filled with horror; how could he be so vulnerable in front of Ling Han?

Back when Yu Wudi had been on the Celestial Path, he at least had been able to fight evenly against Ling Han, albeit he had been at a slight disadvantage. As for now? The two of them were not even on the same level at all.

“You wouldn’t dare to kill me!” Yu Wudi’s face was already flushed, but he was still acting stubborn because he knew that this was the Martial Academy, after all, and Ling Han wouldn’t dare to kill him. Naturally, this made him fearless.

“Take me to find those people who attacked together with you,” Ling Han said calmly. Yu Wudi was the main culprit, so there was no doubt he ought to die, but the other people who had wounded his son also couldn’t be let off the hook. They had to be severely punished.

“Dream on!” Yu Wudi glared at Ling Han.

Ling Han merely clenched his fist, and a terrifying power surged through. Ka, ka, ka, the sound of Yu Wudi’s bones breaking could be heard instantly.

“I, I’ll take you there,” Yu Wudi conceded.
