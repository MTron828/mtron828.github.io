3235 Turning the Defensive into Attack

Hu Can was stunned for a moment before he immediately dodged.

Everyone was shocked. What was going on? The Sword Qi released by a broken sword was actually so terrifying?

Hu Can lowered his head and looked at the sword in his hand. He had a strong suspicion in his heart. Had their two swords been swapped? Why did it feel like he was the one that was holding a broken sword?

Of course, this was just a thought. Hu Can revealed a look of wariness, and at the same time, his eyes turned red.

The power of this broken sword made him feel a chill; he definitely could not allow it to touch him. What did it mean?

Its power definitely surpassed the Fifth Change, reaching the height of the Extreme Bone Tier.

Extreme Bone Tier!

If he could get his hands on it, even if he couldn’t crush those in the Extreme Bone Tier, he would at least have a certain amount of say, right?

Therefore, he was naturally envious.

Lian Xuerong was also shocked. She had never imagined that Ling Han would have such a powerful Spirit Tool.

…This fellow’s strength had increased rapidly. In Meridian Opening Tier, he already had the power of Third Change, and now he took out a Spirit Tool that was Extreme Bone Tier-level. What kind of luck was this?

Really, if he worked hard alone, it would have been impossible for him to attain such an achievement.

Ling Han waved the broken sword, and said, “Hu Clan, listen up. Immediately kneel down and surrender. Don’t stubbornly resist!”

Hearing this, the Hu Clan members were furious.

F*ck, this was the Hu Clan! The Hu Clan, you b@stard!

Hu Can also took a deep breath and said balefully, “Captain Ling, you’re really arrogant! Even if my Hu Clan really committed some crime, it’s not up to a mere vice-captain like you to interrogate us!”

“Banner Lord, can this be considered resisting arrest?” Ling Han turned around and asked Lian Xuerong. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yes,” Lian Xuerong said in a low voice. She was considered to have good composure.

“If you resist arrest, then even if you died, it would be in vain!” Ling Han shook his head, and took the initiative to attack.

“Ignorant brat!” Hu Can sneered and raised his sword to meet the attack.

In fact, the Sword Qi itself did not have much power, but its sharpness was incomparably terrifying, as if it could cut through anything.

Cold sweat rolled down Ling Han’s forehead. He needed to make more judgments now, and the burden was naturally greater, making him somewhat unable to hold on much longer.

However, Hu Can’s power burst was about to end.

Once the Qi and blood began to boil, it was an irreversible process. Therefore, there was only ten minutes. Only super geniuses or those who had cultivated some extraordinary techniques could exceed the ten-minute limit, but it was not more than a few minutes.

Finally, another two minutes passed, and Hu Can’s aura fell.

He had now returned to the normal power of a Fifth Change.

“Old geezer Hu, surrender to arrest!” Ling Han let out a long cry, and switched from defense to offense.

“Humph, do you think that you can suppress me just because I don’t have my Qi and blood boiling?” Hu Can sneered. Ling Han’s original power was weaker than his, so even if he didn’t unleash his full power, he wasn’t afraid of Ling Han at all.

BANG!

The two of them exchanged blows. This time, Ling Han did not dodge again—it was also very difficult for him to dodge. When Hu Can’s explosive period ended, his nerves that had been stretched taut also immediately loosened, giving him a splitting headache. It was simply impossible for him to make a precise judgment.

‘Then let’s fight.’

After the exchange of blows, Ling Han immediately staggered back. He was obviously no match for him.

Although Hu Can had the upper hand, he revealed a look of shock.

This kid’s strength was more than 500,000 kilograms; it had reached about 600,000 kilograms. This was already more than an ordinary Third Change.

‘Heavens, how could there be such a freak?’

“I can’t let you live!” he said coldly. Regardless of whether it was to get rid of future troubles or to seize the Spirit Tool in Ling Han’s hands, he had to kill Ling Han.

Now was a very good excuse. Ling Han had forcefully barged into the Hu Residence and publicly killed someone. This was a serious crime, and he deserved to die.

His expression was cold as he charged towards Ling Han with his sword.

“You’re the one who should die instead of reflecting on yourself and being so overbearing!” Ling Han brandished his broken sword to meet the attack.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In this continuous clash, Hu Can naturally had to dodge the Sword Qi that the broken sword shot out, but the force he blasted out also made Ling Han stumble, and blood even flowed out from the corners of his mouth.

This made everyone puzzled. There was clearly a huge difference in power, so why was he still foolishly fighting?

The members of the Hu Clan themselves didn’t care. It would be best if Ling Han was killed by the impact just like that. Then, this ending would be very satisfying.

Lian Xuerong, on the other hand, was astonished. She didn’t believe that Ling Han was such an idiot. Otherwise, how could he have reached such heights in martial arts?

Ling Han gritted his teeth. The other party’s strength was too terrifying, and every exchange of blows made him feel as if he was being crushed by a mountain. It was extremely uncomfortable.

But why did he still want to fight head-on?

Of course, it was to grasp the frequency of Hu Can’s attacks. Then, he would adjust the frequency of the power overlap and reach a state of synchronization. Then, the other party’s power would be crumbled by him.

That was what had suddenly occurred to him.

If an object could be shattered, then he should be able to do the same to an attack.

Therefore, he chose to suffer the pain of feeling like his body was about to explode to prove this point.

He was such a person. The greater the pressure, the more motivated he was.

Therefore, if he broke through in battle, the time he spent would be far less than the usual comprehension.

However, why was the darkness before dawn so long?

Pu!

Ling Han suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. That attack just now had triggered all the injuries that he had accumulated previously, causing his stomach to turn upside down. He only felt that stars were flashing wildly in front of his eyes.

“Die!” Hu Can seized the opportunity to pursue Ling Han. He wanted to kill Ling Han in one go.

“Stop!” Lian Xuerong shouted and hurriedly waved her whip to block his blow.

Ling Han roared loudly, and threw a furious punch at Hu Can.

BANG!

The two people’s forces collided. Peng, peng, a shocking scene appeared. Ling Han was sent flying, while Hu Can’s figure also swayed, and he retreated continuously.

Lian Xuerong couldn’t help but stop in her tracks, a look of disbelief on her pretty face.

What was going on?

Why had Ling Han’s power suddenly skyrocketed?

He wasn’t in the Blood Transformation Tier, so how could his blood and Qi boil and erupt?

Hu Can’s face was also filled with surprise. This attack did not do anything to him, but how did a weakling suddenly become so powerful?

“What… secret technique did you use?” he asked with a frown.

“Do you want to know?” Ling Han smiled faintly. “Fine, surrender, and I’ll tell you.”

It was blatant teasing.

Hu Can sneered. “Do you think you can block ten or a hundred attacks just because you can block one of my attacks?”

“Wrong, I’m not the one blocking!” Ling Han took the initiative to attack, his fist exploding out. “It’s you who will be blocking!”
