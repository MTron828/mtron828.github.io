Chapter 2242: Showing off his might

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng!

With a heavy blow, Ling Han was immediately sent flying, and also crashed into Meng Feicheng, who was behing him. The two of them were sent flying together.

Yet Kuhaad looked furious. This blow from him had initially been enough to stab Meng Feicheng to death. He had not thought that Ling Han would have interfered. Though both Ling Han and Meng Feicheng had been sent flying, they had only sustained minor injuries.

No, Meng Feicheng had still thrown up a few mouthfuls of blood. That guy who had just appeared was completely unscathed.

A sliver of shock flashed through his eyes. This newly appeared guy had just advanced into Eighth Lotus, so his strength should be extraordinarily weak. How had he managed to sustain a blow from him? Furhtermore, he had exchanged a blow with Ling Han, so he could very clearly sense Ling Han’s battle prowess.

He was at about the fifth level of Eighth Lotus! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This was a Demonic Star.

He thought thus internally while killing intent immediately blazed in his eyes. “I have not thought that there would also be a prodigy like you in such a super low-level dimension… I cannot allow you to live!”

Super low grade?

Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head. At first, he called them low-level, and now it was super low-level. This guy was really looking down on the Celestial Realm.

“Stinky bug, come battle!” Ling Han crooked his finger, his expression incredibly disdainful.

Liu Sanbian and the others were all shocked. They had not expected that Ling Han would actually step out at this moment, and Meng Feicheng had not thought that Ling Han would actually move to save him, either.

“I only did not want you all to die in the hands of a stinky bug from the Foreign Realm,” Ling Han stated calmly. “If you have to die, I should be the one to kill you!”

“Haha, same here, same here!” Liu Sanbian and the others all retorted laughingly. There was definitely no friendship between Ling Han and them, but in the stance against the Foreign Realm, they were completely united.

After they dealt with Kuhaad, they would still battle fiercely to the death for the sake of the Origin Magic Cube.

Kuhaad was naturally furious. His innumerable compound eyes blinked simultaneously, exuding an incredibly evil air, and millions of seals dimmed at the same time, filled with threat.

“Trash of the super low-level dimension!” He charged out.

Though his body was bulky, his movements were incredibly agile. In a flash, he had already arrived in front of Ling Han. His six legs moved at the same time, just like six heavenly axes descending.

Ling Han used Void Space added with the Regulations of Time, and confronted Kuhaad.

“En?” Kuhaad appeared slightly surprised. With differing dimensions, there would also be differences in Regulations, but some Regulations were universal.

For example, the Regulations of Time, the Regulations of Space—these Regulations were extraordinarily powerful.

Hence, after Ling Han channeled the Regulations of Time and Space together, Kuhaad was also slightly stunned because there were not many such prodigies in the Foreign Realm, either.

“I definitely cannot allow you to live!” He opened his mouth, and his two insect fangs, which were astonishingly huge, actually each had a seal, which was presently glowing, making these two fangs of his almost seem like Celestial Tools themselves.

He suddenly directed a bite at Ling Han, and his insect fangs enlarged endlessly, clamping down harshly towards Ling Han.

‘So powerful!’

Ling Han immediately discovered that this blow was not merely targeting him, but encompassed all the surrounding space as well. No matter where he reappered via Void Space, he would still sustain the harsh blow.

However, he was unafraid, and merely channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. His figure was as indestructible as diamond, and?peng, he took this attack head-on.

“Die!” Liu Sanbian and the others did not stand by idly, either, and each moved to attack Kuhaad.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A great battle ensued once more. Though Ling Han’s Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was powerful, he could not possibly channel it without stop. Thus, the main power of the offensive still fell on Liu Sanbian, Meng Feicheng, and the others. Ling Han’s primary role was to see which one of them was in danger, and then he would rush forwards to help them block the enemy attacks.

Of course, his battle prowess should not be underestimated, either. Using Fists of Fury, he could pose a very great threat to Kuhaad. After all, the latter’s eyes, as well as the openings in between his outer shell, were not protected.

Kuhaad’s fury was uncontrollable. It was clear that his strength was superior, and any one of Liu Sanbian and the others could not be a match for him, yet because of Ling Han, the others could unleash their full battle prowess.

Thankfully for him, because the power of Regulation of Liu Sanbian and the others was almost fully expended, Kuhaad still had the upper hand in the battle.

“Though I have to expend a bit more effort, all of you will still have to die!” He released a cruel laugh. These people were all extremely outstanding members of the younger generation of the Celestial Realm. He could deal with over a dozen of them in one stroke, and this could be considered as having accomplished quite a military merit.

Especially when there was still the Origin Magic Cube here!

Though he spoke of it disdainfully, he actually treasured it greatly. Was Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier not awesome enough?

The circumstances of Liu Sanbian and the others was getting worse and worse. Though they had drummed up their remaining power, willpower was not everything. Once power of Regulation was exhausted, it was exhausted.

Peng!

The thigh of the seventh tiger of the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan was pierced through by Kuhaad’s attack, and he released a pained yell. His whole person was still nailed by the insect limb, and moved up and down and right and left following Kuhaad’s movements.

Shua, Kuhaad flicked his insect leg, and the seventh tiger was sent flying. His lower half directly exploded, and his vitality immediately declined several hundred times over.

Ling Han’s ability was also limited. He could not possibly channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll endlessly. This time when the seventh tiger of the Chang Clan being severely wounded was a time when he could do nothing.

“Seventh!” the other eight tigers of the Chang Clan all exclaimed in shock. This time, Seventh had defintiely suffered a severe blow. Even if he managed to survive this, his strength would also decline greatly.

The nine of them were one and the same, and once there was a weak point, their battle prowess as a whole would be weakened as well.

“Hahaha!” Kuhaad laughed loudly. Now that the seventh tiger had suffered a heavy injury, it was equivalent to having weakened the strength of the other eight tigers, allowing him to find an opening. His six legs danced widlly, blazing with killing intent.

Ling Han had his hands full. The strength of the Nine Tigers had instantly dropped from the level of a Fifth Secret monarch tier, and all of them had become a paper basket that could be easily pierced through, so he could only choose to give up on them.

He could not manage to save all of them, and if he did try, it would only drag himself in as well.

Peng, peng, peng.?The remaining eight tigers of the Chang Clan were all sent flying endlessly, blood splattering. Some were fortunate, and were only missing limbs, while some had directly been destroyed, with both their form and spirit eradicated.

Thie was a competition for a rare treasure, and was also a war with the Foreign Realm. It was inevitable that there would be bloodshed and sacrifice.

The Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan were all grieving greatly. They had never thought that this trip would actually result in them nine brothers being separated in life and death.

Kuhaad’s attacks became fiercer and fiercer. Not long after, Liu Sanbian had also been severely wounded, half of his body forcibly severed. Not only were his internal organs exposed, even his brain was revealed, and his mind had almost been pierced right through.

“Trash will always be trash.” Kuhaad was now completely at an advantage. His eyes were fixed on Meng Feicheng. This was the last powerful opponent.

Pu!

He clawed out, and the attack landed on Meng Feicheng’s chest, completely crumbling the latter’s power. Then, a long pipe was actually spat out from his mouth, which then sank into Meng Feicheng’s forehead.

With a hiss, he sucked, and Meng Feicheng’s head quickly deflated.

“The brain juices of a prodigy are indeed delicious.” Kuhaad smacked his lips, appearing not to have been fully satisfied.

This was really too cruel.

“You all belong to Kuhaad!” this insect declared, charging to attack Liu Sanbian again. He had not eaten enough of the latter’s brain juices.

Ling Han was also enraged by now. Though he also consumed beast meat, such actions of Kuhaad had already broken through his tolerance limits.

He moved in a furious rage, sending out a barrage of blows..
