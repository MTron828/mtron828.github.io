Chapter 1638: Pursuing the Open Clouds King

In a battle of six against one, with two of them being peak stage Saint Kings, they finally managed to get the upper hand. When they fought to the 10th day, Ling Han’s injuries had also worsened to the extent that he could no longer fight.

“Kill him!” All six Saint Kings’ expressions were icy cold. Even with their ability, they had to use 10 days’ time to force Ling Han into desperate straits. If this brat was allowed to escape this calamity, there would definitely be no more chances for them in the future.

“I will have to disappoint you!” Ling Han exclaimed coldly. A drop of Indestructible True Fluid channeled through his body, and all his injuries were erased. In an instant, he had returned to prime condition.

This...!

The six Saint Kings almost went crazy. They had only just managed to force Ling Han into a corner after much difficulty, and now he was vigorous and lively again.

“He must have used a secret technique to forcibly heal his injuries. Either this is a temporary measure to suppress his injuries, or he would have to pay a massive price. It definitely cannot be used repeatedly.”

“That’s right. Since we can force him into desperate straits once, we can do it a second time!”

“Put more effort into it!”

Cold daggers shot from the eyes of the six Saint Kings. For those who had reached a height they had, they naturally did not lack toughness and patience. Immediately, they suppressed their throbbing hearts, and began another siege.

Ling Han was inflicting injuries on them in exchange for being injured himself, and after a fierce battle for another 10 days, he was again wounded to the extreme, but the six Saint Kings were also a tragic sight. Ling Han’s extreme speed posed a massive problem for them.

“Die!” the six Saint Kings called out coldly. They had once again forced Ling Han into a corner.

This time, Ling Han could not possibly make a comeback.

However, Ling Han again channeled a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, and his injuries were completely healed once more—with 10 days’ buffering time, it was enough to allow the Indestructible True Fluid to take full effect once more. At present, the only problem was the amount of Indestructible True Fluid. He only had a total of 10 drops, and once they were completely used up, there would be no more left.

The six Saint Kings couldn’t help but shiver in fear; he had done it again! How was this possible! Such a powerful healing technique should only be capable of one use. Otherwise, wouldn’t you have become completely immortal?

They did not dare take another gamble. Perhaps Ling Han would not be able to do this another time, but the problem here was that they had all suffered severe injuries as well. Perhaps they would be killed first without waiting for them to kill Ling Han.

They desperately wanted to obtain the secrets that Ling Han possessed, but not one of them was willing to use their life to trade for these secrets—helping another to complete their goal was something that they would definitely not do.

“Retreat!”

It was unknown who was the first Saint King to turn around and flee. All six Saint Kings actually fled in different directions, and they practically left all at the same time.

Without hesitation, Ling Han focused on the Open Clouds King, and set off in pursuit.

Even if he possessed extreme speed, killing a Saint King would take a lot of work for him too. Thus, he definitely could only target one of them.

There was naturally no need to consider the matter further. It was definitely the Open Clouds King that he was aiming for.

“Damn it!” The Open Clouds King couldn’t help but curse angrily. This Ling Han did not chase the others, yet aimed for him. Wasn’t he clearly showing that he thought that he was an easily bullied target?

He was a peak stage Saint King!

Faced with an opponent that had extreme speed and incredibly frightening destructive power, just fleeing was definitely not the best strategy, as he could be caught up at any time, and receive a fatal strike.

The Open Clouds King turned back around, facing Ling Han directly. At the same time, his feet were sliding, continuing to retreat. With his strength, running forwards or running backwards actually did not have much difference. His speed did not slow down in the slightest.

Ling Han used Lightning Flash, and instantly approached.

“Humph!” The Open Clouds King channeled the power of time. Weng, the flow of time around him immediately became strangely slow. There was the past, present, and future. Even if a Great Saint entered into this area, they would instantly be torn into bits.

Ling Han barged in, his skin immediately becoming bright red. The power of time was tearing at his body. If it were not because his physique was incredibly tough, he would definitely have been torn to pieces by now.

He used the power of lightning. Zi

, Extermination Lightning surged, opposing the power of time.

In theory, the power of time belonged to one of the strongest Regulations, but aside from the Regulations itself, the grasp over the Regulations also factored in. Could it be that a Celestial King who had grasped Wood Element Regulations would be no match for a Saint who had grasped the power of Time?

The Open Clouds King’s power of time originated from his bloodline inheritance. It was limited by the purity of his bloodline as well as his own cultivation level. At present, his cultivation level had reached peak stage Saint King, and was already the strongest cultivation level in the Immortal Realm. Thus, this power of time was primarily affected by his bloodline.

Ling Han was different, though. His Extermination Lightning came from the Heavenly Tribulation Fluid, and was the strongest existence of a Realm. Thus, it was not the slightest bit weaker than the Open Clouds King’s power of time.

Lighting was primarily meant for killing and punishment, and as Ling Han aggressively assaulted, the power of time was shattered to pieces, but his speed had also been hindered. His movements could now be distinguished.

Darkness of the Paramount Night!

Ling Han cast another celestial technique. A boundless darkness spread out, wrapping around the Open Clouds King.

“Just a simple illusionary art, and you think you can deceive me?” The Open Clouds King sneered. He moved his hand, wanting to dispel the darkness, but he immediately realized that this darkness was incredibly dense. He had just dispelled a portion, and there immediately would be a new bunch of darkness filling the space once more.

“Nine Meridians Celestial Sword!” he roared out internally, summoning a Divine Sword. A celestial light appeared, and under his strike, the darkness was forcibly sliced apart.

This was the portion of celestial technique that he had obtained from the Heavenly River King, yet he had never dared to use it in front of others, unless he was sure that he could kill the witnesses. That was because he feared that the other Forbidden Lands would discover this massive secret.

But since there were no others here, and he had encountered a great danger, he naturally would use it without any reservations.

As the Divine Sword struck, celestial light appeared.

Ling Han drew the broken wooden sword. In a direct clash of Saint Tools, the Divine Demon Sword was only Level 17, after all, and he had no wish to damage it. Weng, the broken wooden sword sliced out, with the Lightning Sword Technique channeling from it. There were the Tide of the Ages and Extermination Lightning embedded in the technique.

The Open Clouds King wanted nothing more than to refine Ling Han immediately. The latter had a shard of the power of time, which could advance his grasp of the Regulations of Time. But the problem now was that even the combined force of six Saint Kings previously was not enough to take Ling Han down. Could it be that he would have to use a Celestial King technique to be able to succeed? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Celestial King techniques were indeed powerful, but firstly, he only obtained a portion, and secondly, it was limited by cultivation level. The might that he could release would also be limited.

The two of them battled fiercely. Ling Han only had to face a single Saint King, so he naturally battled freely now. With a loud battle cry, his battle prowess was in full throttle, and attacks poured out like a furious wave.

The Open Clouds King did not show weakness, and faced Ling Han head-on.

The battle prowess of the two was about equal, so neither had an overwhelming advantage, which naturally made the battle become incredibly drawn out. A Saint King wanting to kill another Saint King was a difficult thing to accomplish! Previously, even the six Saint Kings needed 10 days’ time to be able to force Ling Han into a corner. And now, in a one-on-one battle, the battle would naturally be even more drawn out.

Ling Han caused damage at the price of suffering injuries himself. His trump cards were more inclined towards defense. Indestructible True Fluid could instantly heal his injuries, and Reborn from the Ashes could allow him to come back to life from death.

He wanted to slowly wear the Open Clouds King to death.

There was nothing else that could be done. Without overwhelming strength, that was his only option. Peak stage Saint King was the strongest presence of the entire Immortal Realm. Which of them was not an incredibly talented genius? If they could be easily killed, that would be truly strange.
