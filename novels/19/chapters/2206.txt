Chapter 2207: Protected by monarch tiers

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Huang Yishan ignored Gu Yushu. He turned and looked at Ling Han again, and said, “Since you can talk so well, I will give you a chance then. Break a leg, an arm, then kneel down and beg for mercy, and I will spare you.”

He had added everything Ling Han had said together, which could be considered slightly original.

Ling Han shook his head. Even a threat was so boring, how uninteresting.

Hu Niu put down her plate, and kindly reminded him, “You can also a*s-rape.”

Pu!

Instantly, a number of people spluttered. Hearing the phrase “a*s-rape” from the mouth of a woman that was exquisite as a fairy was really a blow to their outlook.

Even Ling Han could only place a hand on his forehead. He had just forbidden the little girl from a*s-raping anyone, and it was now permanently on her mind?

Meanwhile, Huang Yishan was enraged. ‘Are you guys ridiculing me with your banter? Do you think that I, Huang Yishan, am made of clay? You’re seeking death!’

He declared menacingly, “Since you people are so determined to provoke me, then just prepare to suffer the consequences.”

“Brother Huang!” Gu Yushu leaped out. “Please calm your anger. Anything can be discussed peacefully.” He ran out to persuade Huang Yishan precisely because he thought of him as a friend. He had suffered a loss at Ling Han’s hands before, and knew that this guy was practically a demon.

Moreover, Ling Han was his master, and had hold of his slavery contract. Now, with someone attempting to make a move on his master, there was naturally no way he could sit by idly and watch.

Huang Yishan was not aware of these twists and turns, and couldn’t help but look furious as he exclaimed, “Gu Yushu, you have stopped me repeatedly. What is the meaning of this?”

‘I’m trying to save you here. You have absolutely no idea how terrifying this bringer of calamity can be!’

He did not dare to say these words.

Firstly, Ling Han had not allowed him to, and secondly, he could not bring himself to expose his embarrassment in public. Thus, he could only urge, “Brother Huang, listen to me. Just let it go!”

‘Let it go? How am I supposed to let it go? What would that make me then?’

Huang Yishan smirked coldly, and said, “Could it be that if I do not listen to you, you would become my enemy?” These words were already filled with antagonism.

Everyone thought that with how Huang Yishan had spoken such words, Gu Yushu would not continue to insist further. However, they had not foreseen that Gu Yushu’s reaction would be so unexpected.

His expression was solemn as he answered, “If Brother Huang insists, I do not mind a battle, either.”

‘Brother, you would definitely be thanking me in the future.’

Whether Huang Yishan would be thanking Gu Yushu in the future or not was a matter for the future, but now his fury was pushed to the pinnacle.

Why?

Why did Gu Yushu actually become hostile with him for the sake of a stranger? Had this guy gone nuts?

“Gu Yushu, you have really surprised and disappointed me!” Huang Yishan looked coldly at Gu Yushu. “I have always wanted to exchange blows with you, and see which of us is stronger.”

Gu Yushu was naturally also a proud character. Hearing Huang Yishan’s words, he couldn’t help but put on an air of pride, and said, “Then, let’s settle it with a battle.”

Huang Yishan did not waste any more words. With a sudden tap of his foot, he shot into the skies, and Gu Yushu followed closely. Then, a dazzling brilliance exploded in the skies. The two great monarch tiers were already embroiled in an intense battle.

Ling Han and his group raised their heads and watched. With their vision, they naturally could see the battle clearly.

As they sipped tea, they observed the great battle of monarch tiers, and it was indeed an enjoyment.

However, some could not bear to watch on.

“Though there is no animosity between me and you, you guys are just too arrogant.” Another monarch tier stepped out. “I don’t care what insanity has captured Gu Yushu that he would step out on your behalf, but this is the Saintly Origin Academy, and your impudence is not allowed.”

Ling Han cracked a smile, and asked, “What is it? Do you want a battle as well?”

“Battle? Are you even qualified?” That monarch tier smirked coldly. “I am only going to teach you a lesson so that you know what is proper and what is appropriate behavior.”

Ling Han gave an “oh,” and answered, “Not qualified, indeed!”

Everyone thought that he was expressing his agreement with the words of that monarch tier, but in the next instant, they knew that they were wrong. How could someone who had so brazenly set out a table to sip tea right in front of the academy gates be so humble?

“You are too weak, unqualified to exchange blows with me.” Ling Han nodded.

That monarch tier did not become angry, as if he already knew how Ling Han had a sharp tongue. He smirked coldly. “No matter how well you talk, it cannot change your strength. I only have to move, and you will be sprawled out on the ground.”

“Come, that…” Ling Han looked towards Dan Hao. “Right, what was your name again?”

Dan Hao couldn’t help but feel gloomy. For better or worse, he was still a monarch tier, yet he wasn’t even qualified to have Ling Han remember his name?

“Dan Hao.” He could not refuse to answer, so could only reply with a dark expression.

‘Huh?’

Everyone was surprised. ‘Why are you so obedient? It should be known that you are a monarch tier, so what happened to your pride?’

“Oh, Dan Hao.” Ling Han nodded. “I’ll leave this one to you.”

“All right!” Dan Hao stepped out, and walked towards that monarch tier. “Brother Peng, apologies!”

‘F*ck!’

Everyone could not believe it. He asked you for your name, and you immediately replied; he commanded you to fight, and you just obediently ran out. Did you go nuts?

That monarch tier’s surname was Peng, with the first name being Mu. He looked at Dan Hao strangely, and asked, “Brother Dan, could it be that this boy has some incredible background?” Otherwise, how could he possibly command a monarch tier?

Dan Hao shook his head. “Brother Peng, don’t ask so many questions. Just know that harmony is to be prized.”

Again, “harmony is to be prized”! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Had these monarch tier prodigies all gone nuts today? They were all actually advocating that harmony was to be prized?

Peng Mu felt that this was very abnormal. To have Gu Yushu and Dan Hao step out for them one after another… If Ling Han did not have an outrageously powerful background, who would believe that? But monarch tiers like them had also come from Sixth Heaven Celestial King Tier sects, at least, and also had powerful backgrounds, what more now when they had enrolled into Saintly Origin Academy. Did they still need to give anyone face?

What kind of secret were these four people hiding?

“Let’s have a battle then.” He was curious and also very angry. With a leap, he shot into the air, wanting to battle Dan Hao.

Dan Hao naturally would not cower. He similarly rose into the air, and?boom, the second battle soon broke out.

Everyone looked at one another. Next, would there be other monarch tiers that would step out, and want to teach Ling Han a lesson? And if such monarch tiers appeared, would there also be other monarch tiers stepping out to stop them?

All of a sudden, the atmosphere was strangely quiet. Everyone was watching the skies. Four great monarch tiers exchanging blows was not something that could be seen all the time.

Alerted by the great battle of monarch tiers, more people appeared at the gates of the academy, and found out about how things had progressed to this point. There were also monarch tiers among them.

“Oh, interesting!” As expected, new monarch tiers stepped out. “I don’t believe it!”

He did not waste any words. The moment he appeared, he rushed towards Ling Han and his group. He shot out a punch, wanting to overturn their tea table.

Xiu, a figure shot out, and darted towards that monarch tier.

“Ji Kuang!” that monarch tier roared furiously. What was going on here? Were they all traitors? Would there always be someone that would step out for Ling Han and his group?

Ji Kuang was one of the 10 great monarch tiers that Ling Han had recruited. He was internally very displeased as well, but it could not be helped. Who asked him to receive a signal from Ling Han?

“Come fight!” He couldn’t be bothered to waste words, either, and shot into the skies.

At this, everyone could not keep their composure any longer.

Altogether, there were a total of three monarch tiers that had stepped out for Ling Han and his group. Just who exactly were these four people?

Being made of clay means that you have no temper..
