3121 Cool Wind Blowing Against One’s Buttocks

Ling Han turned around to look. It was an unfamiliar man who appeared to be in his thirties.

“Humph, I asked you to sell two Meridian Guiding Pills back then, but you refused. I told you before, you’d better not let me see you within the sect!” the man said through clenched teeth.

Ling Han came to a sudden realization. So it was him!

The first time he went to sell pills, he did meet someone who insisted that he sell two Meridian Guiding Pills, and even said some harsh words. However, at that time, both parties had covered their faces, and did not know each other’s identities.

With Ling Han being outstanding and having made a name for himself at He Miao Yin’s birthday banquet, some people would definitely be able to figure out something.

“Oh, what do you want now?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“Of course I’m going to beat you up!” The man charged forward, throwing a punch at Ling Han. “I’m going to personally send you out of the formation and make you lose your chance to become the Dao Child. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life!”

They couldn’t kill anyone here, as the great formation would send them out at the last moment.

Ling Han’s feet didn’t move. Only when the attack of this punch approached him did he similarly clench a fist and blast it towards his opponent.

Peng!

That person’s body shook, and he couldn’t help but stagger backward. After retreating seven or eight steps, he finally managed to steady his footing.

“What?!” His face was filled with disbelief.

He was a Seven Meridians, and his power reached 7,000 kg. Even if his cultivation level was suppressed, he was definitely stronger than Ling Han by one Meridian.

But now, the feeling was reversed. It was as if Ling Han was the one who was superior to him by one Meridian.

Was Ling Han of Eight Meridians?

How was he supposed to believe this? If this brat who had just entered the sect for less than two months could leap to Eight Meridians, then what justice was there left in the world?

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “You want to send me out of the great formation, but your abilities seem to be a little lacking.”

The man was so angry that he was trembling. After letting out a loud roar, he immediately charged over again and unleashed his Four Directional Fists.

Ling Han shook his head. “You’re filled with flaws!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Over the past few days, he had been studying the Demonic Monkey Fists. Coupled with his insight as a former Heavenly Venerate, the mastery of his fist techniques had actually already reached an astonishing height. In terms of fist techniques alone, even if Sun Jianfang unleashed the true Four Directional Fists, he might not necessarily be a match for Ling Han.

Ling Han only need to move his feet slightly, and easily dodged the punch.

Ling Han shook his head repeatedly, shifting his feet as he did so. He looked extremely casual, but no matter how fast the man swung his fists, they did not even touch the corner of Ling Han’s clothes.

He stared at Ling Han, and suddenly came to a realization. “You’ve mastered a movement technique!”

As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he couldn’t help but reveal a greedy expression. Now that the path of martial arts had just begun, there would be ancient techniques appearing from time to time, but the movement techniques were pitifully few in number.

Did Lord Sect Master pass this down to Ling Han in private?

Why? Just because this guy was some bullsh*t Divine Son?

“Ah…” He roared explosively, and attacked Ling Han like a mad tiger.

Ling Han threw out a punch, but didn’t meet the opponent’s attack head-on. Instead, his fist directly blasted through the flaw in that person’s fist technique, and smashed into that person’s cheek. He didn’t use too much force, and it was completely insufficient to kill him. Thus, that person only flew into the air, and wasn’t sent out of the great formation.

“Aiyo!” That person fell hard, and couldn’t help but groan as he lay on the ground.

Ling Han walked over, his slender figure casting a shadow over the man’s face.

“So what if I don’t sell you alchemical pills? Do you still have any objections?” Ling Han lifted the man up, and slapped him over a dozen times in succession.

However, he quickly lost interest. In the Genesis World, those who were his enemies were all supreme prodigies—Ji Wuming, Feng Wuding, and Xin Qihu. Only trampling such prodigies would bring pleasure to him.

He was done playing.

Ling Han raised his fist, wanting to send the other party out of the great formation. However, after thinking for a moment, his fist did not land. Instead, a strange smile appeared on his face.

The man couldn’t help but have goosebumps all over his body. Looking at this smile made him feel a terrifying fear in his heart.

He couldn’t help but ask, “What are you trying to do?”

“Hehe!” Ling Han chuckled, and began to peel off the man’s clothes.

“No! No! No!” The man was terrified. What was going on?

Could it be that Ling Han had some special fetish?

“What are you screaming for? It’s not like you’re going to lose a piece of flesh!” Ling Han snickered a few times, and stripped the man of all his clothes.

The man only felt cool wind blowing against his buttocks as he thought of the kind of forbidden love that had once prevailed 100 years ago. He couldn’t help but shiver in fear.

Could it be that Ling Han had vile intentions about his a**?

“No…” He covered his butt with both hands, as if he would rather die than submit.

Peng, Ling Han’s fist smashed down, smashing towards the man’s head. This was a fatal blow, but it was precisely because of this that the great formation was activated. Xiu, the man disappeared into thin air.

“Hmm, if I was the designer, I’d use two sets of formations overlapping to achieve it. One is the fog formation, and the other is the defensive formation.

“However, why does this person’s sudden disappearance seem like the Regulations of Space from the Genesis World?

“Interesting. Formations are really worth studying. I believe that they complement martial arts.”

…

Outside the formation.

Shua, a white figure flashed and appeared in the plaza.

“Eh, another person has been eliminated.”

“Pfft, what’s going on?”

Everyone was collectively horrified. This naked man was covering his butt while wailing loudly, and he seemed as if he had nothing to live for. What sort of blow has he suffered?

“This is… Yang Fei!”

“He seems to be a Seven Meridians elite.”

“His abilities are definitely not weak. How did he get eliminated so quickly?”

“Pfft, forgive me for being easily amused, but I really can’t help it. Why is he stark naked?”

“Even if he was sneak-attacked when he was pooping, it shouldn’t be like this, right?”

Everyone was talking animatedly, but they really couldn’t guess the situation at that time.

After screaming for a while, Yang Fei also sensed that something was wrong. He stopped screaming and looked around. He immediately became so angry that he almost fainted.

He was actually stark naked in front of everyone?

Look, some people were even pointing at his buttocks, while some female disciples turned their heads away in embarrassment. They wanted to look, but they didn’t dare to.

It was over. He was really going to become famous in the Ancient Dao Sect, and such a reputation was enough to make him forget about raising his head in the sect for the next 10 years.

He thought about how he would inevitably be pointed at when walking about in the sect in the future. A senior brother would introduce him to his junior brothers and junior sisters who had just entered the sect: this is Yang Fei, the one who revealed his bare buttocks during the audition for the Dao Child position back then.

Ling Han!

Yang Fei gritted his teeth, his eyes spitting fire with hatred. He naturally knew now that Ling Han didn’t have any special fetishes, and was just trying to make him suffer a great humiliation.

‘Bastard, I’m going to kill you.’
