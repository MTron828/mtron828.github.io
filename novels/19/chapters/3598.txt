Chapter 3599: Hit someone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng!

The shuttle crashed into the ground, instantly causing terrifying damage. With the shuttle as the center, a massive pit appeared in the nearby ground, and the energy wave was still spreading into the distance, flames soaring sky-high.

Ling Han was speechless. He rubbed the little loli’s head, and said, “Can you be more reliable? Why did you fall asleep when we landed?”

The little loli’s eyes were hazy, and saliva was dripping from the corners of her mouth, “Don’t be noisy. I want to sleep. If I don’t sleep properly, it will stunt my growth.”

Fine!

Ling Han remained seated. Without the little loli’s control, he couldn’t open the shuttle at all.

Right at this moment, a black object suddenly appeared from the window of the shuttle.

‘What the heck?!

Ling Han got a scare. This thing actually had eyes, and was currently glaring angrily at him.

Peng!

That thing patted the window of the shuttle, and opened its mouth, as if it was saying something. However, the shuttle was travelling through the universe, so it was naturally airtight and soundless. Otherwise, Ling Han and the little loli would have died long ago.

Oh, so this was a person, but his face was covered with black ash.

Ling Han could only see the man’s mouth open, and did not know what he was saying. In short… he should be very furious. Though it was dark, it could still be seen from his expression.

Judging by the other’s attitude, it seemed like he wanted him to go out and fight him one-on-one.

Ling Han shrugged, indicating that there was nothing he could do.

This naturally made that person even more furious. He was no longer clapping a hand on the shuttle, but rather drew out a sword, and slashed madly at the shuttle.

However, that person had clearly made an extremely serious mistake.

The shuttle was definitely a rare treasure of the Sect Master-level. However, limited by the little loli’s strength, it could only unleash power of extreme dao, but now that there was no one to command it, it was attacked, which gave it even more terrifying might. With a slash of the sword, the veined patterns on the shuttle lit up, and that person’s sword was immediately shattered.

p***

That person was dumbfounded with shock. Then, he turned to look at Ling Han, his expression filled with deep hatred.

You b@stard, not only did you crash into me with the shuttle, you actually sat there and didn’t come out. You deliberately mocked me, causing me to shatter a Spirit Tool.

Damn it, damn it, damn it!

Ling Han made a helpless expression. This had absolutely nothing to do with him.

“Noisy!” The little loli woke up. She had been woken up by the sound of that person knocking on the window, and instantly looked at him with a bitter expression.

You actually dare to ruin my sleep? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Didn’t they know that if a woman didn’t sleep well, her skin would become worse?

She was a little beauty. In future, she would become a great beauty, and bring ruin to the whole world.

“I’ll beat you to death, b@stard!” She was fired up now, and controlled the shuttle to launch an attack at that person. Xiu, xiu, xiu, multiple pillars of light shot towards that person.

However, if she controlled it personally, the shuttle’s might would instead be weaker. Thus, that person could completely dodge as much as he pleased. However, he was completely unable to fight back, because he had already tried just now. When the Spirit Tool struck the shuttle, it only shattered itself.

There were definitely 10,000 curses racing through that person’s mind right now. How wronged was he? He had been cultivating here, yet who would have thought that a meteor would directly crash down on him? Because this was a crucial moment in his cultivation, his reaction had been slightly slower, and as a result, he had been hit head-on.

Fortunately, his tyrannical strength only caused him to be disheveled, and wait aggressively to reprimand the culprit. In the end, the Spirit Tool was shattered, and he himself was being shot to the point of dodging left and right by a little loli. Just the thought of it made him so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.

Who had he trifled with?

“Enough, enough.” Ling Han persuaded the little loli, “Can you talk to him?”

The little girl shot out a few more pillars of light, and only then did she stop reluctantly. After fiddling around for a while, she said, “Done.”

Ling Han opened his mouth, and said, “Friend, I’m really sorry. We didn’t mean to smash into you.”

That person said in irritation, “If it wasn’t intentional, why did you hit so accurately?”

What deep resentment, but this was really purely a coincidence.

You see, when the little lolita went to the Celestial Sea Planet, she also hit him right on the head. Yi?

Ling Han looked towards Tang Yun’er, “Did you deliberately smash me at that time?”

“Of course not!” The little loli hurriedly shook her head, looking very innocent.

Ling Han was filled with doubt. Only 70% of this little girl’s words could be taken seriously.

“Then how are you guys going to compensate me?” the victim outside asked.

Ling Han smiled and said, “I don’t have any money, so I can only apologize.”

That person was almost angered to death. ‘Is this the attitude of someone resolving a matter?’

“We really don’t have money,” the little loli added.

Were both adult and child stingy?

The man was rendered speechless. Moreover, he couldn’t do anything to the Shuttle Spirit Tool either. By the looks of it, he could only swallow this loss.

Ling Han signalled to the little loli, and the little loli opened the shuttle, and the two of them jumped down.

The person on the other side did not make a move. Though he could tell with a single glance that neither Ling Han nor the little lolita had stepped onto the Celestial Path yet, to be able to possess such a shuttle-type Tool, their background must be incredibly shocking.

“Sorry, I really didn’t mean to smash you,” Ling Han said with a smile.

The man sighed. Though it was Ling Han and the little loli’s fault that he had been hit head-on, it was he who had caused the destruction of the Spirit Tool afterwards.

Thus, strictly speaking, the other party had not done too much wrong either.

“Forget it, just consider me unlucky.” He was quite open-minded.

Ling Han said, “My name is Ling Han, and this is Tang Yun’er. How should I address you, brother?”

The man took out a sweat towel and clean water, and as he washed himself, he said, “My name is Li Xingchen.”

“So it’s Brother Li.” Ling Han clasped his hands in greeting.

Ling Han had already cleaned up his face, and when Ling Han and the little loli saw him, they both gave an ‘oh’.

This dark guy was actually a pretty boy. Tsk, he really could not tell.

The little girl’s eyes instantly lit up, “Yi, so it’s a Handsome Brother! Hey, Handsome Brother, do you want to have some candy?”

This little girl took out a toffee, and waved it in front of Li Xingchen.

Li Xingchen’s expression involuntarily darkened. ‘I’m not a three-year-old child, yet you’re actually using candy to trick me?’

“Hehehe, just ignore this mischievous brat,” Ling Han said with a laugh. “Brother Li, let me ask you something.”

Li Xingchen was irritated. ‘You guys crashed into me, and caused me to lose a Spirit Tool. Yet, you still want to ask me about something?’

No way, no way!

“Handsome Brother, you have to consider carefully!” The little loli patted the shuttle with her hand, her threat clear in her words.

Li Xingchen was speechless. ‘Are you really a child? You’re a little too mature, aren’t you?’

He sighed, and asked, “What do you guys want to find out?”

Primarily, it was because Ling Han was quite pleasing to the eye. Otherwise, if worse came to worst, he could just turn around and leave. As an elite of Celestial Path, what need was there for him to fear two mortals?

“The place where the power of Five Elements is most concentrated.

“Yi, you want to concoct the Five Elements Karmic Pill?” When Li Xingchen heard this, he immediately came to a realization.

Ling Han glanced at the little loli. Thankfully, though this little girl was unreliable, she ultimately did not deliberately trick him into coming out to play.

“En,” he nodded.
