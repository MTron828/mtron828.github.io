2948 Obliterating the Doppelganger of a Seventh Tier

To have one’s power increase thousandfold… Just what kind of concept was this?

Thank you readers!

At the very least, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger couldn’t block it.

This was only a doppelganger, after all, and its cultivation had also been suppressed. It would have been more shocking if it could rival Ling Han’s explosive power.

Peng!

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger was instantly sent flying. As his body shuddered, there was also a pulsating glow, and it was as if he were becoming less tangible.

!!

This was because his doppelganger wasn’t a fleshly body, and it was instead formed from the fundamental power of the Genesis World. As such, it naturally wouldn’t spit blood. However, Ling Han’s formidable attack almost caused him to crumble.

To the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate, having his doppelganger destroyed wouldn’t be a big deal. However, he had arrived in such a haughty manner, yet he was now going to be obliterated by a measly Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate? Just how preposterous would that be?

With this in mind, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate roared and forcefully stabilized his body, causing it to glow in the process.

He had used a single wisp of his divine sense and six fundamental powers to form this doppelganger. The most important component was his divine sense, and if it was destroyed, he would naturally be unable to regather the other fundamental powers.

“Insolent brat, you actually dare to attack me?!” he roared as he charged at Ling Han.

However, while Ling Han’s power had grown thousandfold, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate was unable to use any Heavenly Venerable Seals. Thus, how could he rival Ling Han?

Peng, peng, peng!

He was sent flying again and again.

Everyone was stunned, and they felt as if they were in a dream.

That was a Seventh Tier elite! Even though it was only a doppelganger, it still shouldn’t have been so weak!

“Attack you? That’s right, my target is you!” Ling Han howled. He knew that he couldn’t hurt the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate even if he destroyed his doppelganger. However, he could thoroughly humiliate him.

Ling Han was eager with anticipation.

‘Old bastard, you’re using the fact that you’re a Seventh Tier elite to bully me, right? Then come on, show me how you’re going to bully me now?!’

Everyone was speechless and transfixed with shock. In their eyes, Seventh Tier elites were invincible and omnipotent beings, yet the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate was actually defeated?

Indeed, no excuse could change the fact that he had been defeated.

“Ling Han, I’ll battle you!” Feng Wuding roared as he charged over. “You’re not worthy of battling against a Seventh Tier elite!”

He was naturally trying to salvage some face for the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate. However, did he think they were all blind? Who hadn’t seen the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate being beaten to a pulp?

In any case, it was naturally beneath the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate to team up with Feng Wuding. He wanted to retreat, yet Ling Han continued to pursue him and attack, not allowing him to break free.

Everyone became even more speechless. Feng Wuding had stepped in to help, yet the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate was still being suppressed by Ling Han anyway. This was truly humiliating.

Feng Wuding was very powerful, but Ling Han was even more powerful. He wielded the power of 100 dimensions as he suppressed his opponents.

These weren’t projections, and they were genuine dimensions.

Feng Wuding was absolutely stupefied. One had to realize that his limit was also hosting 100 dimensions. However, he had only managed to nurture 92 so far.

As for Ling Han?

He had directly unleashed 100 dimensions. Even if this were Ling Han’s limit, it was still enough to draw level with him.

Feng Wuding thought extremely highly of himself, and his biggest trump card was none other than his 100 dimensions. Now, however, Ling Han had easily drawn level with him. How could he not feel despondent?

Was he truly the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era?

“Die, you old bastard!” Ling Han roared as he ferociously unleashed his Fists of Fury. He was going to obliterate his opponent with a single attack, not giving him the chance to recover and regroup.

“Insolence!! Utter insolence!!” the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate bellowed in fury. However, he was completely helpless as his body shuddered violently. With a crack, he eventually crumbled and disappeared.

Everyone was stunned. They could barely believe their eyes.

Seventh Tier elites were invincible—this was something that they had firmly believed. Now, however?

This belief was crumbling before their eyes!

Even though Ling Han had only managed to destroy the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate’s doppelganger after “teaming up” with the restrictions of heaven and earth, everyone chose to ignore this point. They simply knew that a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate had obliterated the doppelganger of a Seventh Tier elite. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In another layer of the Realm Battlefield.

This was a dark and desolate place that seemed much like a void. However, the 10 most powerful people of the Genesis World were all gathered here now, engaged in an intense battle.

Their opponent didn’t show its true body. Instead, it continued to battle them with its countless tentacles, with each tentacle radiating with boundless power. In fact, these tentacles were so powerful that they could kill a Sixth Tier elite with a single strike.

This was the battlefield where the 10 supreme Seventh Tier elites fought against the main body of Hysteria. It was also thanks to them that Hysteria was unable to focus more of its attention on creating new minions. This helped to reduce the pressure faced by those in the two other layers.

This was especially the case after Chong Yan and the others had joined 100,000,000 years ago. Even though they were still at a disadvantage, the extra reinforcements had indeed proved to be extremely helpful.

However, a furious and earth-shattering bellow suddenly erupted.

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate glowed with boundless brilliance, and it was as if even the heavens had to bow before him.

Peng, peng, peng!

His rage became tangible, causing the space around him to shatter.

“Insolent brat!!” he roared, an ice-cold expression in his eyes. He was naturally able to sense the destruction of his doppelganger, and this caused him to become wild with fury.

He was a Seventh Tier elite! A Seventh Tier elite!

No, he had to personally head over. He had to kill that brat.

“Calm down, Shatter Mountains,” Lin Luo said. “Don’t forget our responsibility!”

The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate was beside himself with rage, and he roared, “That brat destroyed my doppelganger! How can I forgive him?”

This was utterly humiliating. He was a Seventh Tier elite!

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan frowned, and said, “His potential is astounding, so if we allow him to develop, who can stop him in the future?”

“We have to seize this opportunity to kill him!” the Big Dipper Heavenly Venerate said coldly.

“Mm-hm!” Mysterious Feather and Half Moon both nodded in agreement. They had all come from the Genesis World of the last era, so they were naturally of the same mind.

“I wholeheartedly disagree,” Lin Luo immediately said.

“I also disagree,” Bai Fan said with a shake of his head.

Wu Zhihong also shook his head in disagreement. However, he didn’t speak.

The Blood Rainbow Heavenly Venerate, the fourth Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate of the Flaming Frost Realm, also shook his head in disagreement.

“Brother Xin, what do you say?” Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan asked as he looked at Xin Fu. He was confident that Xin Fu would agree with them to kill Ling Han. With six in favor and four against, things would naturally be settled in their favor.

Xin Fu pondered for a moment before saying, “I disagree.”

‘What?!’

Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan and the others faltered upon hearing this. Hadn’t Xin Fu dispatched a doppelganger to target Ling Han? So, why was he against killing Ling Han now?

Had he taken the wrong medicine?

Had he been beaten stupid by Hysteria?

It was five votes to five now, so neither side was able to overcome the other.

“Hmph!” The Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate humphed before suddenly turning around to leave. He was a Seventh Tier elite, someone who could only be suppressed but not killed. Moreover, Hysteria would only gain a slight advantage from this, which would allow it to focus a bit more attention on creating new subordinates. Thus, he could leave whenever he wanted to. He appeared as relaxed as could be.

He could act on a whim, but Lin Luo and the others naturally couldn’t. If they left, who would stop Hysteria? Moreover, allowing Hysteria to focus more on creating his army would only accelerate the destruction of the Flaming Frost Realm.

Whoosh!

Tearing open space, the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate flew off and vanished without a trace.
