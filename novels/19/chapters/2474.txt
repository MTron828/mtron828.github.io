Chapter 2475: Forced into retreating

Ling Han and his group had reached an agreement. They had no intention of occupying more bases, but rather would set out towards deeper areas.

“We should still just focus on the Dark Frost Celestial King.”

Conquering five of the Peaceful Underworld Celestial King’s bases in a row was merely a warning to this Celestial King that they were not to be trifled with. Since this goal had already been achieved, they naturally had to return and continue targeting the Dark Frost Celestial King. It couldn’t be helped; Ling Han had times when he would be petty and hold a grudge.

They switched their targets, and continued onwards.

After their conquering a few more of the Dark Frost Celestial King’s bases, this Celestial King finally could bear it no longer.

Nine bases was just the right number to maximize the benefits of the peculiar light and peculiar fragrance. It was useless even if they had more than that, so though the loss of a few bases displeased the Dark Frost Celestial King, it was still within a controllable range.

But after losing another few bases, the number of bases under the Dark Frost Celestial King’s control became less than nine. How could this be allowed?

He sent out two Second Heaven Celestial Kings to return and guard the bases, engaging in a fierce battle with Ling Han and his group.

The battle this time was especially intense. Both sides were truly angered by the battle, but ultimately, it still ended with Ling Han and his group retreating. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It could not be helped. Though Ling Han and his party also had two Celestial Kings with Second Heaven Celestial King Tier battle prowess, their Vitality Index was only around 6200, after all. Among Second Heaven Celestial Kings, this number could not be ranked in the upper tiers, and the two Celestial Kings under Dark Frost Celestial King’s command were both middle stage or even late stage Second Heaven Celestial Kings. Added with the fact that they had the aptitude of emperor tiers at the very least, their battle prowess far surpassed Ling Han’s group’s.

Ling Han and his group returned back to the last base, preserving their strength, and improving their abilities while getting ready for a second attempt.

If they wanted to continue onwards, firstly, Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan would have to walk further on the level of the First Heaven. If they could reach the peak stage of the First Heaven, their battle prowess would probably reach the peak stage of the Second Heaven. This naturally was enough to emerge superior over all other Second Heaven Celestial Kings.

Secondly, Ling Han, Huo Furong, and the other elites could advance into the Celestial King Tier. Then, their battle prowess would definitely soar directly into the late or even peak stage of the Second Heaven.

......

They thus stayed patient, and earnestly cultivated in their bases. They were all working hard on increasing their strength.

Ling Han, Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, and the others all set their differences apart, and conversed without any personal reservations. They thought that the Celestial Seed they respectively nurtured was indeed close to perfection. Even if they did not obtain that perfect Celestial Seed, they could still advance into the Celestial King Tier in their strongest state.

After all, this so-called strongest was only nurtured by heaven and earth. In nature, it was indeed the strongest, but to the individual, only one that was completely suited to them uniquely was truly the strongest.

After confirming several times, they decided to cultivate here, right until their Celestial Seed was perfect and flawless, and then they would break through into the Celestial King Tier.

“Perhaps this light and this peculiar fragrance is the perfect Celestial Seed.” They all held this guess.

They settled their hearts, and stayed patient. Very quickly, 300 years had passed, and only a 1,000 years was left until the deadline of 10,000 years. The battles on the front lines had also become more intense. The Celestial Kings were all pouring blood. They could witness showers of blood rain from the skies, ghostly wails, and howling practically every day.

Yet Ling Han and his group paid absolutely no attention to anything that happened outside. They were all earnest and working hard on cultivation. They would break through before the deadline of 10,000 years, and participate in that final great battle.

But right at this time, their peace was broken.

“Get out here!” someone shouted from outside, the tone extremely arrogant and also very disdainful.

Ling Han and his group just happened to complete a single round of absorbing the benefits of the peculiar light and peculiar fragrance, and thought, ‘Who is it now that has suddenly charged onto our doorstep?’

“Why does it sound a little familiar?”

They arrived at the entrance of the palace. With their pride, they would not lower themselves to blocking the entrance and battle there.

‘Huh?’

Seven people had charged here in a single party, and they were led by two Second Heaven Celestial Kings. They were enshrouded in two streaks of celestial light, which was incredibly dazzling. Additionally, there were also four other First Heaven Celestial Kings whose aura was also very strong. They should be at the peak stage of the First Heaven, and only one of them had not advanced into the Celestial King Tier, and was only a Pseudo-Celestial King.

But it was this Pseudo-Celestial King that surprised Ling Han and his group.

Dongfang Rui!

He was actually cooperating with the Dark Frost Celestial King?

“Ling Han! Today will be the day of your death!” Dongfang Rui declared, his expression filled with mockery.

Ling Han scoffed, “Have you taken so many pills that even your brain is not working right anymore?”

Dongfang Rui knew that Ling Han had a mean tongue, and naturally would not be angered. He had that level of self-control. He swept an eye over Huo Furong and the others. “Everyone, on the basis that we are all from the Celestial Realm, please do not interfere so we would not hurt the peace between us.” His words were mainly directed towards Huo Furong. She was acclaimed as the Number One Celestial, and similarly had a Heavenly Venerable Tier background.

Yet Huo Furong was very disdainful. “Dongfang Rui, you really are getting more childish with age. To actually find helpers for a battle of equals; you truly are bringing embarrassment to Lord Sealed Emotion!”

Dongfang Rui did not consider it as an embarrassment, but rather laughed loudly. “I have reached an agreement with Lord Dark Frost. Lord Dark Frost will help me obtain that perfect Celestial Seed, and in return, after leaving the Celestial Path, Lord Dark Frost will also obtain guidance from my father. Becoming a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be no problem.”

Huo Furong couldn’t be bothered to waste words on him. With a flutter of her sleeve, she paid no further heed to him.

“Ling Han, you will definitely die here today!” Dongfang Rui declared menacingly. Ling Han had already become one of his internal demons. He definitely had to be gotten rid of.

Shi Chanzi looked towards Ji Wuming. Only he and Jia Lan were capable of opposing Second Heaven Celestial Kings out of all of them here. If they made no move, Ling Han could only flee.

Ji Wuming nodded. “If you can kill him, go ahead. No need for mercy.” At this instant, he had turned once more into the Buddha of Slaughter that mercilessly lifted the blade.

Dongfang Rui turned, and said to the two Second Heaven Celestial Kings beside him, “Please move, Milords.”

These two people did not dare put on airs, either. After all, he was the only son of a Heavenly Venerate. Previously, they did not know of the existence of Heavenly Venerable Tier, but it was enough for them to know that Heavenly Venerable Tier was even more awesome than Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

“We will definitely not disappoint Young Master Rui,” the two Celestial Kings said, giving Dongfang Rui enough face.

They strode out, approaching the palace.

Shi Chanzi stepped out, standing in front of Ling Han, and Jia Lan, after some hesitation, also chose to stand beside Shi Chanzi.

The two great Celestial Kings in front of them were naturally prepared. They did not feel it was strange for Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan to appear. They moved without any reservations.?Boom, great dao turned into weapons, and exuded a boundless celestial brilliance in their hands as they blasted towards Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan.

Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan also went all out, battling fiercely with the two great Celestial Kings.

However, these two great Celestial Kings were clearly stronger, and had also ingested the Subduing Purple Fruit. Very quickly, they had gotten the upper hand, and were beating down on Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan. Though their victory was not instantaneous, they definitely would not take too long.

Only half a day later, Shi Chanzi and Jia Lan had lost completely. The two great Celestial Kings arrived, forcing Ling Han and his group to have no choice but to retreat.

They took separate paths, and after they had managed to throw those two Second Heaven Celestial Kings off their tails, they finally reunited at a base in front.

Their peace did not last long. They had only stayed here five days when Dongfang Rui and the two Second Heaven Celestial Kings had charged here again.

They were outmatched, and so could only flee once more.

WIthin a bit more than a short dozen days, they were forced to run here and there, losing one base after another, causing their anger to build and build up.

“I am about to break through,” Ling Han said.
