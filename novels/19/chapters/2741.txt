2742 Ling Feifan

‘Danger?’

This was Ling Han’s first reaction. With his cultivation, if he entered someplace dangerous, his divine sense would immediately react and give him a warning.

However, he immediately shook his head. This place was peaceful and tranquil, and it didn’t seem like a dangerous place no matter how he looked at it. Moreover, his divine sense wouldn’t miss any detail, so he was certain that no elite had approached him.

Perhaps someone dear to him had come across trouble?

This was also impossible! Such a feeling would only occur if both parties were in the same dimension. However, his lovers were all inside the Celestial Guest Residence, and the Empress was definitely still in another dimension. Thus, how could he experience such a feeling?

He brushed it off as a mistaken sensation. He had been cultivating in earnest for far too long, so perhaps his brain was a bit muddled?

He decided to ignore it. However, after a short while, this feeling of apprehension became increasingly strong, so much so that he was unable to ignore it any longer.

“What’s going on?”

Ling Han decided to put aside the task of searching for the core of the dimension first. He needed to deal with this sensation, or else he would be unable to cultivate properly.

***

This was the Martial Crystalline Realm, a low-level dimension. The most powerful elites in this realm were seven Second Tier Heavenly Venerates. Because this dimension was located much too far away, they had failed to receive the command of the Flaming Frost Realm. Thus, they remained as the rulers and overlords of this dimension.

Of course, Second Tier Heavenly Venerates were indeed very powerful as well. In any case, this was also the limit of what this low-level dimension could hold. Otherwise, if they were more powerful and didn’t leave, it would be this dimension that crumbled and vanished.

In fact, it wasn’t that the Flaming Frost Realm couldn’t extend its influence to this dimension. Rather, it was that all dimensions starting from the Martial Crystalline Realm were low-level dimensions. They possessed far too few elites, so the elites from the Flaming Frost Realm chose not to waste their time visiting these dimensions.

The cultivators here were extremely committed to the realm wars, and this was because the medium-level dimension above them hadn’t launched an invasion against them. As such, they could unleash their full power at the low-level dimension beneath them. Right now, they were on the cusp of victory.

Once their dimension advanced, the upper limit of their cultivation level would also be increased. The Second Tier Heavenly Venerates all eagerly anticipated the arrival of such a day.

The An Clan.

“That unfilial girl still hasn’t changed her mind yet?” An Tayun asked, his face filled with rage and his might overwhelming.

This was only natural. He was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so just a glare from him could kill a Celestial King at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven.

“Father, she’s your daughter. Don’t you understand her temper?” a young man beside him said with a bitter smile. There were nine ribbons of iridescent light around him, signifying his status as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

This was a low-level dimension, so a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate and a Ninth Heaven Celestial King were a formidable force that could crush the world.

An Tayun raised his hand, wanting to slam it down on the armrest of his chair. However, after holding his hand in the air for a while, he ultimately decided against slamming it down. Instead, he heaved a long sigh, saying, “I pampered that girl far too much, never interfering in her matters. Now what? She’s actually discussing marriage with those dogs from the Promise City Realm! Where does that leave me?”

The Promise City Realm was the dimension that the Martial Crystalline Realm was attempting to destroy and engulf.

“That little bastard! He actually dared to seduce my daughter! If I capture him, I’ll definitely hack him into a thousand pieces!” An Tayun said with a humph.

“Father!” Right at this moment, a young man ran inside, saying, “I’ve just received this report. Our army achieved an overwhelming victory, and we captured a large number of enemy cultivators. The brat Ling Feifan is also among them!”

“Haha!” After faltering for a brief moment, An Tayun immediately roared with laughter. “Bring him over!”

“I’ve already sent someone over to grab him,” the young man replied. He was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and he was An Tayun’s second son, An Pinghai.

The other Ninth Heaven Celestial King hesitated for a bit before saying, “Father, are you truly going to kill him? Little Sister doesn’t seem like she’s playing around this time. What if she becomes too heartbroken?”

He was An Tayun’s eldest son, An Pingtian.

An Tayun glared at him, saying, “He’s a dog bastard from the Promise City Realm! If I wed my precious daughter to him, wouldn’t I essentially be colluding with the enemy? Hmph! I’m definitely going to smack that brat to death!”

Only after a month was Ling Feifan finally brought to the An Clan. After all, none of them were Heavenly Venerates, so their speed naturally wasn’t impressive.

An Tayun personally walked out of the An Clan residence. He wanted to see for himself just how extraordinary this Ling Feifan was1 that he could actually capture the heart of his dear daughter.

A youth sat on the ground, with no shackles on his body. However, his cultivation had already been sealed. Even if no one guarded him, he would still be unable to run very far in a day. A Mountain River Tier cultivator would be able to catch up to him in a single stride.

Thus, this young man was sitting on the ground all alone, an indifferent smile on his face. If one looked closely, one would find that his appearance shared a 30% similarity with Ling Han’s.

Not only was his appearance similar, but even his disposition was similar.

An Tayun humphed, saying, “You still dare to remain seated after seeing me?”

Ling Feifan picked himself up and clasped his hands, bowing in respect.

An Tayun felt even more displeased. How had this coward captured his daughter’s heart?

“My respects to Father-in-law,” Ling Feifan said.

An Tayun’s jaw instantly dropped, speechless. F*ck! This was no coward at all! This was a fearless hooligan!

“Pu!” An Pinghai couldn’t help but splutter with laughter.

Pa!

An Tayun instantly smacked him across the head. This brat actually dared to laugh at his father? Had he grown tired of living?

An Pinghai bared his teeth. His father was seething with anger, so that smack had truly been painful.

“You only just advanced to the Celestial King Tier, so what makes you think you deserve to become my son-in-law?” An Tayun asked. Even though he detested this brat who had seduced his daughter, he had to admit that he was fairly brave.

It was also because of this that he was willing to continue this conversation.

Ling Feifan wore an apologetic expression as he replied, “In fact, there’s nothing special about me. It’s just that I’m a bit handsome, am an honest person, and also have huge potential that could see me become a Heavenly Venerate in the future.”

The corners of An Tayun’s mouth twitched upon hearing this. ‘Are you sure you’re being apologetic? Are you not just praising yourself?’

He detested this kind of careless and superficially clever person.

“Kill him, kill him!” he said with a wave of his hand.

“Father! Father!” a woman cried from inside the residence. A beautiful girl with delicate features then ran over, with An Pingtian trailing behind her.

She grabbed An Tayun’s elbow, and said, “Father, you can’t kill him!”

This woman was An Tayun’s only daughter and youngest child, An Xiu’er. She was only a few million years old, and she enjoyed much doting from An Tayun.

An Tayun couldn’t help but shoot a glare at his eldest son. He had told him to keep an eye on her and stop her from coming out, yet he had treated his words as nothing but just that, words. Otherwise, with his strength as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, how could he possibly fail to catch up to his younger sister, someone who had only just become a Celestial King?

He twirled his beard, and asked, “Why can’t I kill him?”

An Xiu’er gritted her teeth, and said, “Because… Because I’m already pregnant with his child!”

“Hah?” Ling Feifan’s jaw instantly dropped to the ground.

‘I’ve only touched your hand!’ he thought to himself. ‘You can even get pregnant from that? She’s truly giving it her all to save me!’

Meanwhile, An Tayun became wild with rage, his hair billowing even though there was no wind. He glared at Ling Feifan with a wicked expression, saying, “Very well, brat! How very impudent of you! You even dared to lay hands on my daughter!”

Right now, he simply wanted to kill this brat. He reached over to grab Ling Feifan.

“Father, if you dare to touch him, I’ll commit suicide!” An Xiu’er hurriedly shouted, her voice firm and resolute.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
