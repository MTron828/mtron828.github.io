Pa!

Ling Han stretched out his right hand, and grabbed the fist that the sturdy man had thrown at him. Under the powerful impact, he did not move in the

slightest.

He looked towards the Seventh Imperial Prince, and said, “So it turns out that the Demonic Beast that is skilled in Spiritual Power was reared by you! It was also you, to hide this fact, who had launched the beast tide, and massacred

Huju City!”

When these words fell, the expressions of the five men and women changed drastically.

Yet the Seventh Imperial Prince was calm and unhurried, and said calmly, “You

are right. It was indeed me.”

“Die!” The sturdy man threw another punch.

Ling Han stretched out his other hand and grabbed the sturdy man’s left fist as well. He nodded, and said, “No wonder your spiritual power is so strong. That should be related to those spiritual-aligned Demonic Beasts.”

“Hahahaha.” The Seventh Imperial Prince laughed loudly. “That’s right. My spiritual power was rapidly developed through the help of those Demonic

Beasts!”

“You’re truly deranged!” Ling Han chided.

“Just some foolish commoners. Being able to contribute to this king’s grand ambitions, this can be considered as fulfilling the value of their lives.” The Seventh Imperial Prince said calmly, “It was also you that made this king determined to massacre the city, and thus allowing me to gather enough Blood Divine Crystals, pushing this king’s Spiritual Power to the level of Great Accomplishment!”

“So, you won’t be able to escape either!”

Ling Han smirked coldly, “To satisfy your own selfish desires, you can sacrifice everyone in this world, so what need is there for you to find a scapegoat?” He knew that the Seventh Imperial Prince was an ambitious and ruthless character, but he had never imagined that the latter would actually be so deranged. In order to destroy the evidence, he actually launched a beast tide to massacre the city, and took advantage of this opportunity to create even more

Why was the Seventh Imperial Prince able to launch a beast tide?

It was very simple. The spiritual type Demonic Beast could control other Demonic Beasts. As long as there were enough of them, it would naturally form a beast tide.

He gave a loud shout. Peng, and the sturdy man was sent flying, crashing heavily into the palace walls.

The brawny man spat out blood madly. This blow was really not light, causing him to be severely injured.

“Ling Han, Ling Han, Ling Han, how nice would it be if you had been obedient and sided with me?” The Seventh Imperial Prince said coldly, not even casting a second look at the brawny man, “However, now that I think about it, you would never be resigned to being inferior to others, and your natural talent in cultivation is so terrifying. Sooner or later, you will rebel.

“My mistake is that 1 shouldn’t have any expectations of you!”

Xiu! A colorful figure flashed over, charging towards Ling Han.

It was the only woman in the group of six attendants. She looked to be in her thirties, and was as beautiful as peach blossoms. With a soft exclamation, she stabbed her sword towards Ling Han. Then, with a shake, qiang, this sword opened up like an umbrella, turning into several dozen thin swords that shot towards Ling Han.

Two Inscriptions!

Ling Han saw very clearly that there were veined patterns on this woman’s heart and liver. Clearly, she had cultivated to the second level of the Inscription

Tier.

He released a battle cry, and shot out a punch that was enshrouded in golden energy. At the same time, he also burst out with his strongest power. Fifty overlapping bursts of power smashed towards the woman.

Peng!

That umbrella sword bore the brunt of it, and was immediately shattered. Then, the force of the punch did not decrease, and still blasted towards the woman. The woman was sent flying, drawing an arc in the air, and fell heavily onto the ground.

The woman struggled to get back to her feet, but she had just stood up, when she sat back down. Her whole face had turned red, as if blood was about to seep out.

The Seventh Imperial Prince’s expression was as dark as could be. The two subordinates of Inscription Tier were no match for Ling Han, which made him lose face.

However, though the heaven and earth environment was rapidly recovering, it had only been a short while, after all. He still didn’t have enough resources to create existences of Enlightenment Tier-apart from himself.

Could it be that he would have to take the field himself?

Then what was the point of raising so many subordinates? So they could be spectators at the sidelines, cheering and clapping?

However, if he didn’t attack, how could he kill Ling Han?

Moreover, there were so many Treasured Fruits here!

“Your Imperial Highness, let me!” An old man walked out. His hair had all turned white, but his whole face was extremely rosy.

“All right, then I’ll have to trouble Elder Ge to help.” The Seventh Imperial Prince nodded, appearing very respectful towards this old geezer.

This old man’s name was Lu Ge, and he was already over two hundred years old.

Before the first great upheaval of heaven and earth, Lu Ge was a fist practitioner, and was quite accomplished. He was already over a hundred years old, yet was still able to fight two people single-handedly, and defeat two young men.

After the drastic changes in heaven and earth, he welcomed his second spring. With the help of the Treasured Fruit, he had successfully stood at the forefront of martial arts. Because his fist technique was exquisite, it was not a problem for him to defeat a stronger opponent.

The Seventh Imperial Prince had also paid a certain price to take this person as a subordinate. Usually, he was also very respectful, and addressed him as Elder Ge.

A few years ago, Lu Ge finally advanced into the Inscription Tier, and with the full support of the Seventh Imperial Prince, he also rushed up to the peak stage of Five Inscriptions. With his accomplishments in fist techniques, it was enough to sweep aside all opposition in the Inscription Tier.

If Lu Ge stepped out, that should be enough. Even in a battle of equal cultivation levels, with the essence of his fist technique, he probably wouldn’t be defeated too quickly.

Then, as long as he forced Ling Han’s Absolute Fairness out, he would be able to easily deal with this disobedient guy.

LU Ge smiled proudly, and walked towards Ling Han. With every step, he was like a lion. He was clearly very old, but now, an astonishing vitality was exuding from his body, soaring into the skies hke smoke signals.

Show off!

Ling Han humphed. However, there was a price to pay for acting in front of him.

He was already holding the Heavenly Pattern Jade in his hand, and was instilling spiritual power into it. This only needed a short ten seconds.

Lu Ge deliberately did not move swiftly, but rather walked slowly towards Ling Han. Every time his feet landed, a heavy sound would be heard, as if his steps were landing on his heart, forming an extremely great pressure.

This was what he liked to do. From his mind to his physical body, he would completely destroy his opponent.

Eight seconds, nine seconds, ten seconds.

It was done.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and with a wave of his right hand, shua, the Heavenly Pattern Jade was thrown out. With the Spiritual Power activated, it instantly soared from six times the speed of sound to seven times, eight times, nine times!

It was as fast as lightning.

Lu Ge was instantly shocked beyond belief. From the hands of a cultivator of Extreme Bone Tier, he could actually deliver an attack that was nine times the speed of sound?

How was he supposed to dodge this?

If he had known that Ling Han would have this move, he would have targeted Ling Han’s hand. The moment he moved, he would immediately dodge. Then, there would be a process for him to throw out the Heavenly Pattern Jade, which was enough for him to dodge.

However, by the time the Heavenly Pattern Jade was thrown out, the two of them were only 15 meters away from each other. How could he dodge?

He forcefully threw a punch at the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

It had to be admitted that he, an experienced fist user, was indeed extraordinary. His instincts were extremely accurate, and in the face of the pressure of life and death, he also exploded with great potential. This punch was actually delivered in the nick of time, and it even greeted the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

A look of delight instantly appeared on the old geezer’s face. When he was young, he was known as Iron Fist. After he truly stepped onto the path of martial arts, he had also invested a lot of energy in his cultivation. He had even learnt a Spirit Diagram that could communicate with high-level energy, and the power of his fists was indestructible.

So what if it was nine times the speed of sound? Under his iron fists, it could only be shattered.

Peng! The Heavenly Pattern Jade crashed toward him..
