Chapter 3550: Seven Inscriptions

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everything was as expected. It was very simple, and in just over three hours, Ling Han had broken through to Six Inscriptions.

“I’m just a little bit away.”

Ling Han thought. Even if he didn’t break through to Enlightenment Tier, as long as he advanced into Seven Inscriptions, he would definitely have the battle prowess to match Mystery Realm Tier elites.

He didn’t need to rely on Spirit Tools, the Heavenly Pattern Jade, the Void Beast hide, and so on. With his own strength, he could genuinely battle a Mystery Realm Tier head-on.

And what he had to do was to cultivate for a few more days.

“As expected of Six Inscriptions as breaking limits. I now have much more room for improvement than when I had just reached the Five Inscriptions. Thus, 1 need three to four days to reach the peak stage.” After Ling Han looked at himself, he nodded.

The higher one’s cultivation level, the more difficult it would be to battle those above one’s cultivation level. Part of the reason was that after breaking through the limit, one would not have as much room for improvement as when one’s cultivation level was lower.

For example, when a martial artist in the Meridian Opening Tier the gap between one who had reached Twenty Meridians and one who was only in the Twelve Meridians could be said to be as wide as the sky. One with Twenty Meridians was enough to sweep aside a hundred Twelve Meridians. However when one reached the Inscription Tier, even a Six Inscriptions would only be’ able to deal with three or four Five Inscriptions at the same time.

Thus, if he wanted to be freakishly invincible, he would have to break through on the basis of his limits.

Ling Han continued the process of simulating Seven Inscriptions. He had to make full preparations, and at the same time, inscribe on all the remaining organs. The difficulty level was extremely high, and was also incredibly important. He had to ensure that nothing went wrong.

When he cultivated in the early morning, the Ice Origin Stone, something that couldn’t be hidden at all, immediately exposed him. Some people were still fine, as they hadn’t reached the peak stage of Mystery Realm Tier yet, so they first took advantage of it a bit before running over to attack.

However, there were some people who were already at the peak stage of Mystery Realm Tier and didn’t need to cultivate anymore. They would immediately charge over fiercely, seriously affecting Ling Han’s cultivation.

Once, he had even come across Hong Tianbu, who was extremely resolute. Although he had just stepped into Mystery Realm Tier, he didn’t want to take advantage of the Ice Origin Stone at all. He charged over at the first instant.

In this place, Ling Han couldn’t possibly use the Imminent Skyline, and in terms of control over his movements, Hong Tianbu, as a freakish genius wasn’t much inferior to Ling Han. Hong Tianbu continued to follow him ’ persistently, and he was unable to throw him off his tail.

Or was it because it was especially coincidental that the power of heaven and earth had changed, affecting the formation. As a result, when Ling Han crossed into a new field of flowers, Hong Tianbu suddenly disappeared, as if he had entered into another world.

What a mysterious formation.

Ling Han grasped the profoundness within. After a long time, he shook his head. His cultivation level was too low, so he had no way to comprehend this at all.

Without reaching Celestial Path, he couldn’t see the slightest clue at all. Ling Han made the most of his time, using the last bit of time to cultivate. Then, he found a place to hide, and continued to simulate Seven Inscriptions. One day, two days, three days… Time slowly crept by. Ling Han wasn’t in a hurry. In any case, he had already achieved his goal. Now that he had obtained a top-notch Celestial Foundation Divine Stone, it wouldn’t matter even if he had no gains at all in the following days.

Because he was severely affected, on the ninth day, Ling Han finally reached the end of Six Inscriptions.

Finally, he had arrived!

Ling Han took a deep breath, and suppressed the excitement in his heart. He only had to cross another barrier, and he would be able to take his revenge. ‘Come!’

He began to break through to Seven Inscriptions in the Essence Nurturing Gourd. 5

This was incredibly difficult. Just think, when Ling Han had reached the Seventh Change, that was when the Power of Dimension in his body suddenly showed its might. Even he himself was muddleheaded. Before that, he had absolutely no idea that he could reach the Seventh Change.

And in the case of Seventh Extreme, he had shattered his own bones, and found a way out of extreme death.

What about Seven Inscriptions then?

Should he explode his organs one after another?

Ling Han gritted his teeth. If that was really the case, would he die first?

After all, he didn’t have the Indestructible True Fluid that could immediately heal his injuries, and he didn’t have Rising From The Ashes that could revive him.

Ling Han shook his head. Extreme Bone Tier elites could shatter their own bones, but Inscription Tier elites definitely couldn’t shatter their own organs The two were in completely different directions.

Previously, he had already had a great many ideas, and now that he tried them one after another, he kept failing, but he was not discouraged at all If it was really easy to reach, how could there be no legend of Seven Inscriptions in this world?

Ling Han made a new attempt. This time, he had the organs of Six Inscriptions move continuously, trying to use them to resonate with the other organs, and thus step out of that unprecedented first step..

After a long while, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that his stomach was actually responding!

However, after trying it out, he discovered that this response was too weak, and was far from being able to cause a leap in his level of being.

What to do?

The direction was right, but the heaven and earth seemed to have restrictions, and the extreme of “seven” was definitely not allowed to appear. Whether it was Seventh Change, Seventh Extreme, or Seven Inscriptions, it was impossible to achieve this with normal means.

However, Ling Han had a special technique.

With a move of his Spiritual Power, all the living creatures of the entire inner world responded in unison. They all released their Spiritual Power, fusing it with Ling Han’s thoughts.

Though all this Spiritual Power originated from millions and millions of living beings, they all originated from Ling Han’s inner world, and could be considered a part of him. There was naturally no problem in fusing them together, causing Ling Han’s Spiritual Power to become stronger and stronger. This could only be borrowed temporarily. If he extracted endlessly, then all the living creatures of his inner world would become living dead.

Boom, this colossal Spiritual Power surged out, and only acted on Ling Han’s insides, but it was as if it had opened up another world, expelling the Regulations of this heaven and earth or a similar existence.

My territory? I’m in charge here!’

Seven Inscriptions, open!

Boom, a sudden clap of thunder suddenly rose up in the heaven and earth of the outside world, as if it was filled with fury at Ling Han’s treasonous actions.

Ling Han released a battle cry, and used this instant to stimulate the rise of his level of being.

Kuang! Kuang! Kuang!

On this divine mountain of the Ethereal Peak, a violent storm suddenly raged Dark clouds rolled over their heads, and lightning flashed endlessly. It was as if some most evil and malicious thing had appeared in the world, and a punishment of lightning was about to descend to erase it.

This wasn’t a fantasy. According to legends, a great many powerful evil beasts had been killed by the divine lightning in this manner.

In the field of flowers, everyone felt uneasy, because this was targeting precisely this field of flowers, causing a chill to rise up in their hearts. What if a lightning punishment really descended? With their strength, how would they be able to bear it?

They wanted to flee, but they were lost in this field of flowers, and could not leave at all.

A golden vein appeared on Ling Han’s stomach.

Seven Inscriptions!

Though there was only one veined pattern, it also meant that this was Seven Inscriptions.

Hong, hong, hong! Wild lightning struck endlessly, but Ling Han’s level of being had already begun the leap. This was something that even the heavens could not stop. A drastic change was also taking place inside his body. This was a drastic change in his level of being.

“Thunder has sounded suddenly, and it seems to have a specific target?” Hong Tianbu murmured, “According to the ancient record, there are only two possibilities.”

“There’s an Innate Divine Physique that has come into being, or… there’s a heaven-defying event.”

“This heaven-defying matter could either refer to a certain living being having done something that went against the heaven and earth, or it could also be that his own existence would be going against the heaven and earth.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Could it be that it… is Ling Han?”
