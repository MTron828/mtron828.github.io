3043 Suppressing Shatter Mountains

Although he had already been a father twice, Ling Han was still overjoyed to know that he was going to be a father for the third time.

Before the child was even born, Ling Han immediately traveled all over the Genesis World, paving the best path for his own child.

Pregnancy was difficult, but giving birth wasn’t an easy task, either. It might take hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years.

After Ling Han prepared the natural treasures, he first headed to the Realm Battlefield.

Even if Zhu Xuan’er was far inferior to the Empress, because Ling Han was too powerful, this child would definitely not be born quickly.

Ling Han directly ran to the place of enlightenment of Shatter Mountains. If there was good news, he naturally had to “share” it with his old rival.

To his surprise, Shatter Mountains’s place of enlightenment had really reopened and accepted countless disciples.

Eh, why was this old bastard so shameless?

Ling Han landed, and directly knocked down the plaque on the doors of the place of enlightenment with a palm. Then, he raised his voice, and said, “Old thief Shatter Mountains, your grandfather is here again.”

Pu!

Those who were cultivating in the place of enlightenment spluttered in unison, and their eyes widened in disbelief.

What was going on?

There was actually someone who dared to call Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains an old thief and call himself grandpa?

How bold was he? Anyone who heard him would shiver.

“Who are you? How dare you come to our place of enlightenment to cause trouble?” Someone jumped out. At this time, he naturally had to perform well. Perhaps Heavenly Venerate Shattered Mountain would view him in a different light and take him in as a personal disciple?

Ling Han ignored him. He naturally wouldn’t take such a small fry seriously.

He only needed to wait for a moment. He believed that Shatter Mountains would appear soon.

“I’m asking you a question!” the Celestial King from before shouted loudly. Hong, his voice turned into a huge sword that slashed towards Ling Han.

“Calm down,” Ling Han said softly, and the huge sword shattered with a loud bang. Meanwhile, that Celestial King also flopped down onto the ground with cold sweat rolling down his forehead, unable to move at all.

Instantly, no one dared to move anymore. Even a fool knew that Ling Han’s strength was unfathomable, and he was not someone a Celestial King could match at all, because that Celestial King was at Ninth Heaven.

In just a short while, the sky was filled with a dazzling red glow, and a terrifying aura that made one’s heart tremble assaulted them.

“Brat!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains appeared. He was clearly much stronger, and he exuded a suffocating feeling that even heaven and earth could not contain.

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. It seemed that he wasn’t the only one who had improved. Shatter Mountains had progressed as well.

This was very natural. After so many years, Shatter Mountains had probably pushed all the dimensions in his body to the high-tier high-level dimension level. Thus, his strength had naturally increased by another level.

“You’ve come to court death!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said with a cold smile. Stimulating his supreme power, he charged towards Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and tore open the Void to enter into the Void.

He did not want to start a fight in the Profound Negative Realm.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains did not hesitate at all, and immediately followed him in. He swung his fist at Ling Han, and the force of his fist blasted out, transforming into a huge skull that seemed to want to swallow Ling Han whole.

Ling Han stopped and turned around to face the attack.

Peng!

This time, Ling Han had only channeled the seventh-grade combination seals, increasing his power by 2,000 times. However, he had advanced to the Sixth Tier, and his own power had taken a huge leap, and was even stronger than when he had used the sixth-grade combination seals previously.

With a punch, the skull immediately exploded. Ling Han let out a long cry, and counterattacked Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains.

“Old thief, surrender obediently!”

Shatter Mountains sneered. Weng, he released the dimensions in his body, imbuing them with boundless power.

One, two, three, four… Eh, he actually released 13 dimensions, and all of them were high-tier high-level dimensions.

As expected, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had obtained more than six dimensions from Feng Wuding. It was just that he hadn’t nurtured them to the point where they could have become his battle prowess, so even if he had used them in the past, it would’ve been useless.

13 high-tier high-level dimensions were equivalent to at least 130 Sixth Tiers working together to help him. This was no joke.

Ling Han also unleashed the Powers of Dimension in his body to face this attack head-on.

Boom! The Void trembled, and the energy storm was swept away and exploded. It was an extremely spectacular sight.

It had to be said that the Power of Dimension of a high-tier high-level dimension was extremely terrifying.

Approximately 100 Sixth Tiers would be comparable to a Seventh Tier in terms of power. In other words, the power of Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was at least double that during his previous battle with Ling Han.

But how many times had Ling Han’s strength increased?

Although he had just advanced to the Sixth Tier, and his hundreds of thousands of dimensions were still low-tier high-level dimensions, his own strength had increased tenfold.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

There was no need for him to use sixth-grade seals, and Ling Han already had the absolute upper hand, forcing Shatter Mountains to retreat repeatedly.

“What?!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains faced the sky and roared, appearing to be incomparably furious, and even more disbelieving.

After reaching the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, his strength could no longer improve. Thus, the fact that he could still increase his power by more than a fold was incomparably astonishing.

But even so, he actually still couldn’t defeat Ling Han, a Sixth Tier.

How could he not be depressed by this?

All kinds of Heavenly Venerate Techniques were channeled one by one. Shatter Mountains had lived countless epochs longer than Ling Han, and had mastered countless wondrous techniques. However, the difference in power was too great, so it was useless no matter how many techniques he mastered.

This was because techniques were only methods to use one’s power. If the difference in power was too great, everything would be useless.

In merely a few hours, Shatter Mountains was forcefully suppressed by Ling Han.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han grabbed Shatter Mountains and headed towards the Realm Battlefield.

This trip took more than two hours. Ling Han naturally couldn’t channel the Heavenly Venerable Seals constantly. In any case, if Shatter Mountains didn’t channel the Heavenly Venerable Seals, Ling Han wouldn’t use them, either. If the other party used them, he would use them.

This way, his power would always let him suppress Shatter Mountains. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He originally wanted to “visit” Chong Yan and the other three old thieves, but he realized that his current strength could only suppress a single Seventh Tier, so he shouldn’t be too greedy.

He had the time, so there was no hurry.

“Brat, quickly let go of me!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ face turned livid. If his current appearance was seen by others, how could he endure it?

Ling Han naturally ignored him. Several days later, he arrived at the Realm Battlefield.

During this period of time, he naturally fought with Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains a few more times, but Shatter Mountains was mercilessly suppressed by him each time, unable to shake him off at all.

“Get inside!” Ling Han threw Shatter Mountains, and Shatter Mountains was thrown into the passageway leading into the main battlefield.

“Brat!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains charged over, his hair flying in anger.

“Go to where you belong,” Ling Han said calmly. With a single punch, he sent Shatter Mountains flying back. He stood at the passageway leading into the main battlefield, like an insurmountable mountain.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains stared fiercely at Ling Han. After looking for a while, he turned around resolutely, and shot into the depths of the battlefield.

It was better for him to go in by himself than to be forced by Ling Han because he definitely wouldn’t be able to resist Ling Han, and if Lin Luo and the others saw this, he would be completely humiliated.

Humph, he would just stay here for a period of time. He didn’t believe that Ling Han would continue to guard this place forever.
