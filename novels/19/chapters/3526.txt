Chapter 3527: Fighting over the ship

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Following the course of the river for half a day, Ling Han came out of the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

He felt that it was a pity that he had missed out on today’s cultivation. As for Hong Tianbu’s pursuit, he didn’t take it to heart. The two of them were already as incompatible as fire and water, and this was extremely normal.

“My cultivation… My cultivation is really progressing too slowly,” Ling Han murmured.

Actually, his cultivation was not the slightest bit slow. It was just that he could not compare to some extremely lucky people.

“However, my victory lies in the fact that I’m taking things one solid step at a time, and my foundations are incredibly sturdy.” Ling Han made an objective evaluation.

He set out again.

Since the Ethereal Peak was overseas, hedefinitely had to cross the sea. Thus, the first step was to rush to the coast, and find a ship to cross the sea.

Right now, it was rumored that the seas were also extremely dangerous. Not only was the Sea Race not to be overlooked, but there were also mysterious danger zones appearing in the seas. After entering that sea, the initially calm seas would suddenly become tumultuous, and even Mystery Realm Tier elites would be easily smacked to death there.

Some reefs surfaced, and at night, a mysterious song rang out. Those who had gone over to investigate never came back.

In short, there were many mysterious places in the sea, and they could not be underestimated.

If they wanted to cross the sea, they would still have to find an experienced ship. Otherwise, it was highly possible that they would not be able to get anything at all, but would instead die at the bottom of the sea, and be shared as food among the fish and prawns.

The Dark North Nation’s territory was very large, and there were also many cities near the sea, so there were many routes to the sea.

Originally, Ling Han would definitely choose the nearest route, but now that he was being hunted down by Hong Tianbu, he naturally had to reconsider.

He soon made his choice, and headed towards the Four Yang City.

This was a city by the sea. There was a harbor, but it wasn’t large in scale, and it wasn’t close to him either. If he still encountered Hong Tianbu, Ling Han would just have to admit that he was unlucky. Worse come to worst, he would just have to run again.

Using four times the speed of sound, it only took him less than two days to reach Four Yang City.

He first found a place to rest, and when he had recovered to his prime condition, Ling Han arrived at the harbor, looking for a ship to set out to sea. Unexpectedly, there was a sea of people here, and ferries were hard to come by. Furthermore, the tickets were ridiculously expensive.

-It was up to you whether you wanted to board or not. If you didn’t want to board, there would naturally be others begging to board the ship with large amounts of money.

Ling Han found a large ship. Since he was going out to sea, a large ship would definitely be safer and more comfortable. This ticket had actually been won through a bidding war. Spending a few thousand jade seeds on a single ticket was no different from robbery.

Thankfully, what Ling Han lacked the least now was jade seeds.

The current network had completely collapsed and changed, and the imperial family’s power of governance was not as strong as it used to be. Thus, these remote cities no longer used the Dark North Coins, but rather directly used jade seeds for transactions.

Ling Han had many Spatial Spirit Tool on him. Some were filled with jade seeds, while others were stuffed with food. There was everything he needed in them, so paying for the ticket was naturally no big deal.

The captain of the ship said that they would set out at dawn the next day.

A night passed, and after Ling Han finished cultivating, he arrived at the harbor, preparing to board the ship.

But he was just about to board the ship, when he was stopped.

“Apologies, this ship has been reserved by a Lord. Here, the ticket fare is returned to you!” A sailor said, and tossed out a sack.

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Since I have bought tickets, you all have the duty to take me out to sea. If you suddenly go back on your word, how are you going to compensate for the damage caused to me?”

Being able to ascend the Ethereal Peak at the first instant meant that he would definitely be able to take the initiative. From the moment the news spread out until now, four to five days had already passed. Ling Han did not want to waste another two to three days’ time.

“Hehe, I can’t do anything about that. This is the decision of our boss, so it’s useless even if you tell me.” The sailor shrugged, looking like it had nothing to do with him, and Ling Han shouldn’t bother him about it.

He was extremely proactive when he was collecting money, yet now, he was procrastinating endlessly?

Ling Han humphed, and said, “Today, you all have to give me an explanation!” “What explanation do you want?” A cold laugh rang out, and a group of people walked out of the ship’s hold. The one in the lead was a young man who looked to be in his twenties, his face filled with arrogance.

There were seven other people behind him. There was a middle-aged man who looked to be in his thirties, and there was also a white-haired old man who looked to be in his seventies, but even the white-haired old man was striding forwards, possessing a captivating aura.

Obviously, this group of people were all cultivators.

Ling Han activated his ocular technique, and with a single glance, he could see through all of their cultivation levels.

Two Mystery Realm Tier elites, five Enlightenment Tier elites, and the young man’s cultivation level was the weakest. He was only in Inscription Tier, which was his equal.

Their group should have come out of the prison. Otherwise, how could a young man of Inscription Tier bring a group of powerful subordinates?

As long as he activated Absolute Fairness to defeat the two Mystery Realm Tiers, the others wouldn’t be a problem.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, then turned to look at the young man, “So you are the one who disregarded the rules and snatched this large ship?

“Haha, I have as many jade seeds as I could want. So what if I like to throw money around?” The young man laughed loudly, having an exaggerated arrogance about him.

Ling Han knew that this was because he had been repressed in the prison for too long. Now that he had escaped and come out into the world, and was suddenly in a world of pleasures, he would definitely be overwhelmed, so it would not be strange for him to be arrogant to an inconceivable extent.

However, he had chosen the wrong person.

Ling Han shook his head, “Then I can only ask you guys to disembark.” “Impudence!” A middle-aged man immediately jumped out. “You actually dare to speak to my Young Master like this? Are you tired of living?” “Breaking both his legs and pulling out his tongue is enough. There’s no need to kill anyone,” the young man said calmly.

“Young Master is so benevolent.” The others all praised, making the young man feel smug, as if he really was some kind of benevolent ruler.

Xiu, the middle-aged man charged out and attacked Ling Han.

This was an Enlightenment Tier elite who had opened about twenty acupuncture points. As he shot out a punch, not only was the power of his punch rolling out, those acupuncture points were also exuding power, like hidden weapons. Though their power was not as strong as the barrage of punches and kicks and strikes from weapons, their advantage was that it was hard to defend against.

However, Ling Han activated his Eye Technique, allowing him to clearly see each of his opponent’s attacks.

He charged forward and launched a powerful offensive. Peng, peng, peng! In just a few moves, the middle-aged man was knocked off the ship. With a plop, he fell into the sea.

“En?” The young man and his group were all surprised. They had not thought that Ling Han’s strength would actually be so strong.

“Zhang, Quan, Zhao, Xuan, the four of you attack together,” a white-haired elder spoke up.

Immediately, the remaining four Enlightenment Tier elites all walked out, surrounding Ling Han.

Ling Han stood with his hands behind his back, appearing to be completely unconcerned about those four people.

“Show off!” the young man said in displeasure. This should be his special privilege, making him feel as if his limelight had been stolen.

“Young man, you have to pay the price for your arrogance!

The four Enlightenment Tier elites all launched an attack at the same time. They didn’t have the reservedness of elites at all, and it was only natural that they teamed up.

Because in the prison, Enlightenment Tiers couldn’t be considered elites at all, so it was naturally impossible for them to develop the bearing of elites.

Ling Han activated his Eye Technique and saw through their attacks. He then started to counterattack..
