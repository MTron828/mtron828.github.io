Chapter 817: Yi Shuang Shuang Moves

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A palm strike from a Shattering Void Tier elite was only equivalent to Ling Han stumbling?

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically—did this guy have the life of a cockroach and could not be killed? A Shattering Void Tier elite moved, and he was actually unscathed. Oh, there was indeed some dust on him, but that was all.

Setting aside Ling Han, even if it was another Shattering Void Tier elite, he would be severely wounded or even instantly killed with such a blow!

No, no, no, no, this had to be a lie!

Xu Xiu Ran’s eyes were popping out in shock, his mouth gaping widely. He even had his tongue hanging out in astonishment. Don’t blame him for losing his composure. He knew very well how astronomically difficult it was to cultivate body arts to the extent of Level Ten precious metal precisely because he was a prodigy!

The Sea Race was powerful, right? All of them had a bloodline, especially the royal clans. With their True Dragon bloodline, not only were their chances of breaking through to the Shattering Void Tier greatly increased, they were all cultivators of body arts at the same time and possessed tough physiques. In a battle between opponents of equal cultivation level, they could absolutely claim the upper hand.

But there were very, very, very few rulers of the Sea Race that could reach the extent of Level Ten precious metal in terms of their physique. Breaching this gap was much too difficult. Not only did one need to be of the True Dragon bloodline, the purity level also had to be extremely high.

For example, the four seas’ ruling clan, the Ao Clan, had two to three people who had managed to cultivate their physique to this level. Additionally, that alternative dragon of the Ghostly Dragon Cave was also a unique case. His ancestral bloodline was very pure, and he had managed to reach this level before.

Why couldn’t that alternative dragon be killed even when Immortals descended to the Lower Realm? Simple: that was because his physique had reached the toughness of Level Ten precious metal—it was too difficult to kill him!

The owner of such a physique could only be slowly refined after being subdued. However, that alternative dragon had had a battle prowess of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier, so how could he allow anyone to slowly refine him to death?

Ling Han was currently only in the Deity Transformation Tier, yet his physique had reached the level of Level Ten precious metal. How could one not lose composure in the face of this reality?

Xu Xiu Ran sighed internally. His defeat in Ling Han’s hands wasn’t the least bit undeserved. If he could actually slash through the latter, then Level Ten precious metal would really be too cheap, wouldn’t it?

The Beast Snake King had lived for so many years, and was one of the strongest elites of the current era. Thus, he naturally was the type not to even blink if the sky collapsed. He looked coldly at Ling Han, and said, “I have really never imagined that your physique has actually reached this level!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Old Beast Snake, do you still want to kill me?” After Ling Han had swept himself clean of the dust on his body, he once again soared to stand in mid-air.

In truth, the toughness of one’s physique was only a characteristic trait of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll—its stronger trait was its recovery abilities. Even if someone with the Body of Diamond lost a limb, he would be able to regrow it automatically, but had absolutely no need to circulate the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll for that—how frightening was that?

Naturally, he was not about to tell this to his opponent.

The Beast Snake King sneered, and said, “You merely have a slightly tougher physique. It is fine even if I temporarily cannot wound you. I merely have to capture and bring you back to be slowly refined. One year, ten years... I will manage to refine you completely eventually. The things I lack the least is patience and time.”

“Can you capture me?” Ling Han pointed with a finger.

Instantly, the Beast Snake King felt displeased. What level of existence was he, and when had he ever seen anyone point at him like so? He was immediately going to make his move, but his hand had just raised, when he abruptly stiffened, and called out, “Your Honor, please reveal yourself to see me!”

“What if I don’t want to see you?” Yi Shuang Shuang’s laid-back voice was heard.

“Then please do not interfere, Your Honor. This is the will of the five great sects!” The Beast Snake King humphed.

“Little earthworms... who knows how many I have trampled to death previously? You actually dare to be insolent in front of me!” Yi Shuang Shuang said haughtily. She still did not appear. “I do not want to become enemies with that big earthworm, either. Just get lost so that I will not be called a bully in the future!”

“Your Honor, your boasting is a bit too exaggerated!” the Beast Snake King countered with a sneer. He was one of the strongest elites of the current era, with battle prowess reaching twelve Stars of Shattering Void Tier. Those that could match him in this world were really numbered.

There was no need to mention those monsters of the Purple Moon Empire. All of them knew four to five Mystical Powers, and could make use of power of the nation too, so their battle prowess exceeded even fifteen Stars!

“Are you getting lost or not?” Yi Shuang Shuang rebuked directly.

The Beast Snake King took a deep breath. It was obvious that she was a Shattering Void Tier elite—there was no need to doubt this. However, how much battle prowess did she possess? At this time, the war with the Purple Moon Empire was very difficult. If they had another enemy of the Shattering Void Tier, that would be an additional burden!

It was best not to add another enemy to their enemies’ ranks—unless he had confidence to kill her here. However, they were both in the Shattering Void Tier, so if one of them wanted to flee, there was still a high chance of accomplishing this. In the worst-case scenario, they could ignite their life source, and they could manage to explode with enough speed that not even descended Immortals could manage to catch up to them.

“All right. I will only take this junior with me!” he called out, pointing at Ling Han.

“No way!” Yi Shuang Shuang refused decisively.

“Your Honor, you are too tyrannical!” the Beast Snake King countered coldly. Did she really think he was afraid of her?

Yi Shuang Shuang broke out into laughter, and said, “I have always been tyrannical. You don’t like it? If you’re capable of it, then come and fight me. See how I shall deal with you!”

The Beast Snake King trembled in rage. This woman was really too much of a ruffian. He paid her no more attention, and instead stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han. Since he could not smack this monster to death, he would capture him, and bring him back to be suppressed.

With such physique, he could completely be treated as a human-shaped alchemical pill. Once refined, he would definitely be very nutritious.

“How dare you!” A slender hand smacked out. It enlarged endlessly, blocking the large hand that the Beast Snake King had stretched out. Peng , the two palms collided, and instantly formed a visible ripple that surged out in all directions in midair.

Weng, weng, weng . Immediately, a semi-circular light shield appeared over the Imperial Capital below them. The force of this shock wave caused it to tremble and look like it was about to be destroyed. Pa, pa, pa . There were a few places that had cracked. The shock wave instantly caused tremendous damage.

Thankfully, because this light shield was there, the Imperial Capital was only shaken. Otherwise, it would definitely have been completely leveled.

Shattering Void Tier was too powerful!

In midair, a light shield also appeared over that battleship. The ship swayed and shook as if it was floating on water and had been affected by waves.

“Yi Shuang Shuang, don’t fight him here. My Imperial Capital will be destroyed!” Ling Han called out. That defensive light shield was actually formed by that image of the Black Tower above the Imperial Capital.

This was the amazing use of power of the nation.

If he could solidly unify the whole north region, the defenses formed would probably be so strong that not even the Beast Snake King would be able to breach them.

Yi Shuang Shuang’s figure flashed out, and was already standing in mid-air. She flipped her hair in displeasure, and said, “Brat, you’ve gotten brave, haven’t you? You actually dare to order me around?”

“Milady, please suppress this old snake. Is that better?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

“Though it’s not really all that earnest, I have a very helpful personality. There’s nothing for it, so I’ll just help you this once!” Yi Shuang Shuang turned to look at the Beast Snake King, and showed off a gorgeous smile. “Little worm, if you don’t leave, you really won’t have any more chances to!”

“Who are you, Your Honor?” The Beast Snake King looked at Yi Shuang Shuang with utmost seriousness. He actually could not identify the level of her cultivation. This meant that her cultivation level was not beneath his.

It was definitely impossible for her to exceed him in cultivation level, though. In this realm, the maximum was the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier—unless it was a descended Immortal.
