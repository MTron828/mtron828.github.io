Chapter 1536 He really killed him

Too bad. No matter how strong a Small Saint was, in front of a Great Saint, he was still just a Small Saint.

Hu Yingmu had not been gifted the blood essence of a Saint King; for a Saint King, this was also a massive loss, and would damage his life force. But he himself was a Saint, and also had a precious robe that could dispel the attacks of even a Great Saint. In his eyes, it was enough to allow him to do as he liked in the Immortal Realm.

However, he encountered a “rash fool” who clearly knew how shocking his background was, yet was still determined to hold on to him.

There was no need for this, right?

Hu Yingmu used all his effort to break through the siege, but in front of the present Ling Han, this was a completely impossible feat. The moment he rushed out, he would be smacked back by a massive hand that shadowed the skies. All his effort only ended up in him being dizzy.

All the students watched with their hair on ends; this was planning to kill a Saint!

A Saint was noble and highly revered. Even an elite like the Star Sand Saint did not dare to easily suppress the other Small Saints, because there was not much difference in the speed of Saints. If one party was clearly trying to flee, the other party could only chase futilely from behind.

The present situation was different. Who asked Hu Yingmu to barge in on his own accord? This was equivalent to delivering himself up on a silver platter. If he still managed to flee like that, what justice would be left in this world?

Didn’t that mean that the Star Sand Saint could only watch on helplessly as any Small Saint came here and ran berserk?

What a joke.

Thus, at least in these one hundred million years, it had never been heard that a Saint had been killed. There were those that died of old age, but there was not one that had died in battle.

But now, this exciting scene was about to play out!

Killing a Saint, and the one who would be killing a Saint was an Eternal River Tier!

Heavens!

Hu Yingmu had gone crazy. He did not hold back from burning his own life force. Otherwise, he would definitely be dead. By this time, even if he did not want to, he had to put his life on the line. But so what if a Small Saint burned his own life force? He was still incapable of matching the battle prowess of a Great Saint.

“Ah!” he cried out, having an arm forcefully ripped off.

“Urgh!” he groaned as a large hole appeared in his chest.

“Hiss!” He frowned as his back suffered a palm strike. Even his heart had been crushed.

Even so, he could still fight—the vitality of a Saint was sturdy. In fact, there was not much effect on his battle prowess. When one had reached the height he had reached, what was important was using the Regulations of heaven and earth. As long as his spirit was not destroyed, it could be claimed that his battle prowess would be maintained at prime condition.

However, a spirit was established on a physical body. Without a physical shell, a spirit would only be a weed that had lost its roots. Thus, as long as Hu Yingmu’s physical body was destroyed, his spirit would be exposed. By then, it would be too easy to kill him.

But right at this moment, Ling Han’s aura suddenly declined.

Hu Yingmu was first stunned, then became overjoyed. The blood essence of a Saint King in Ling Han was about to be fully consumed.

He only had to last for a while longer, and would be able to survive this crisis.

“Hahahaha!” He laughed madly. “A mere Eternal River Tier and you still want to kill a Saint, that would only happen in your dreams!”

This was what a Saint was. Even if Ling Han possessed a drop of blood essence of a Saint King, he would not be able to kill a Saint, either. It was too difficult.

“Is that so?” Ling Han smirked coldly, and drew the Divine Demon Sword. Pu, he stabbed it into Hu Yingmu’s body.

“The basis of your confidence is only a drop of Saint King blood essence. Once the saintly blood is consumed, you are nothing in front of me!” Hu Yingmu scoffed. “An ant will always be an ant. Even if you wear an imperial robe, you will still be a piece of trash! You— pu!”

He suddenly paled in shock. A frightening murderous aura was bubbling inside his body, and instantly destroyed his life force completely.

Why was it like this?

He hurriedly had his spirit leave his body. Even if he had to discard this body, he would not hold back. At least he could secure his life. As long as his spirit was still present, he could still make a comeback.

However, it was too late!

The Divine Demon Sword had been forged from divine metal, and having this kind of powerful weapon stab into his body, especially into a vital point, would definitely mean death.

Hu Yingmu’s spirit had indeed left his body, but the murderous aura had already infected his spirit. It was endlessly eroding his spirit as if it was being weathered away. In an instant, it degenerated.

“No...” A sharp howl rang out from his spirit, and echoed in everyone’s mind.

This was only a short instant. Hu Yingmu’s spirit had disappeared, and he was completely dead.

A Saint had thus vanished.

Kuang, a sudden clap of thunder sounded in the skies, and a shower of blood rained down. A Saint had died, and gave rise to a lament from the heavens. From a certain aspect, a Saint represented the heaven and earth. When a Saint died, the heaven and earth would grieve.

Everyone was dumbfounded. He had really killed a Saint. Something that definitely was impossible to happen had really, truly happened.

Heavens!

This definitely was the largest miracle in history. An Eternal River Tier had killed a Saint, and he wasn’t even in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier. That was a level that theoretically couldn’t manage to kill a Saint.

After persisting for 30 minutes, the rain of blood finally stopped. The dark clouds dispersed, and the thunder stopped. Everything returned to normal.

Ling Han turned around and walked back. The divine light on his body had already weakened greatly, but the eyes everyone looked at him with were still filled with reverence.

“Follow me.” The Star Sand Saint curled out a hand, and brought Ling Han back to the Ancient Academy. He did not even call the nine Small Saints with him.

Zhu Xiu’er was surprised, fearful, and filled with hatred simultaneously. This naturally scared her to death, but the Star Sand Saint had completely ignored her “bitter experience”, which made her extremely furious. ‘I am your wife here, your son’s mother!’

Ling Han and the Star Sand Saint conversed secretly for close to a day, and only then did he return. He immediately called his two wives over, and made his preparations to leave the Wood Figure Planet.

On this day, he asked the Star Sand Saint a great many questions, especially concerning the field of prediction. He found out that when one had entered Saint King level, elites truly would possess that kind of ability. However, it was very vague, and only those Saint Kings that were focused on studying this area could become highly accurate.

Unfortunately, that ancestor from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land should be that kind of Saint King.

Hu Yingmu had died, and in a few days, this ancestor would charge over here. Thus, Ling Han had to leave, and the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy would also put up an act and order the arrest of Ling Han. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was not just the Myriad Directions Galaxy that he could not stay; he could not even go to the surrounding galaxies. The prediction of a Saint King was not omnipotent. The nearer he was, the more accurate the prediction would be, and the farther he was, the more vague it would be.

He had to immediately leave. Saints could travel through tearing a rip into space, and were even faster than the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. If he didn’t leave now, it would be too late.

Ling Han asked the opinions of the Rain Emperor and the others. They all expressed the wish to remain. There were many king tiers here, and competing with them could allow them to advance their cultivation level at a faster pace.

Ling Han left behind a large number of leaves from the Reincarnation Tree, as well as a great many top-grade God Tools and Saintly Material which he allowed the Rain Emperor and the others to freely choose from. He did all that he could—everyone possessed top-grade cultivation techniques and top-grade materials, and were also nurtured by the resources from the academy. If they still did manage to reach the apex with all this, there was nothing else Ling Han could say.

After doing all this, Ling Han, the Empress, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden set out. There was not a minute to lose.

On the fourth day after Ling Han left, a golden path suddenly descended from the skies, and landed on the Wood Figure Planet. Then, a frightening saintly might surged out, causing everyone to feel a tremor radiate from the depths of their hearts.

“Are you still not coming out to see me?” A voice rang out. An elder appeared, his saintly might rolling out as if he was the master of this heaven and earth.
