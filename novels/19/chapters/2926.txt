2927 Venting Anger

Ling Han was hated by many, but everyone had to admit that this guy was incomparably freakish. When he was a Third Tier, he already possessed Fifth-Tier battle prowess, and he could come and go as he liked through Hysteria’s base, killing countless enemies.

Feng Wuding, a prodigy from the Genesis World of the last era, had even obtained the inheritance of that Genesis World. Although no one knew what this so-called inheritance was, Feng Wuding was definitely extremely powerful.

When he was in the Third Tier, he, too, could match a Fifth Tier, which was sufficient to prove that his strength wasn’t inferior to Ling Han’s.

Previously, the two of them were already at each other’s throats, provoking each other from afar. It was believed that the first thing Feng Wuding would do upon arriving at the Realm Battlefield was to challenge Ling Han to prove that he was the strongest prodigy in history.

!!

However, unexpectedly, despite Feng Wuding having already arrived at the base camp for three days, he didn’t seem to have the slightest intention of challenging Ling Han.

Everyone was dumbfounded. What was going on here?

Yet someone had guessed Feng Wuding’s thoughts, and said, “This must have been deliberate on Feng Wuding’s part. He does not take Ling Han seriously, and disdains to challenge him at all.”

Was that indeed the case?

“Ling Han, that brat looks down on you so much. Can you really tolerate that?” The large black dog came over to find Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “So what about it? Should I go and challenge him?”

“Go on!” The large black dog nodded. “That brat is so arrogant, so how can we not teach him a lesson?”

Ling Han shook his head. “He did it on purpose. He wants to elevate his own status, so why should I help him to accomplish his goal?”

The large black dog thought about it and agreed. Ling Han’s reputation was earned through battle, and had long since received public acknowledgement. Despite Feng Wuding’s starting point being very high, he didn’t have any astonishing battle merits after all.

If Ling Han was to challenge him first, then Feng Wuding would be able to make a move, which would naturally raise his reputation to the next level.

“He is truly too shameless. He actually wants to use my Little Han’s name to ascend to a higher position. No way, Grandpa Dog is going to teach him a lesson.” The large black dog ran off angrily.

The two supreme prodigies did not exchange blows, but there was a considerable number of skirmishes between the Ling Alliance and the World Alliance. Whether it was at the Realm Battlefield or in the Profound Negative Realm, a considerable number of battles had erupted between both sides, with each side sustaining victories and losses.

However, the conflict between the two major forces became more and more intense. Not only did the conflicts become more frequent, but more and more people got involved.

It wasn’t until one incident that finally made Ling Han furious.

Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing were not at the Realm Battlefield. The couple was responsible for expanding the territory in the Profound Negative Realm, but they were ambushed by the World Alliance, resulting in the two of them being severely injured and almost unable to return.

Family and friends were Ling Han’s bottom line. Previously, he had been negotiable in all aspects, and treated this kind of conflict as a kind of training for everyone, but now the actions of the World Alliance had gone too far.

“Ling Han!” The Empress and Hu Niu both looked at Ling Han.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han stood up, his expression dark.

“Where are we going?”

“To the World Alliance!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The three of them walked out of the house, and headed in the direction of the World Alliance.

Despite this being the Realm Battlefield, the various great forces still divided their territory. One would be here, while the other would be over there. Usually, every force would mind their own business and stay in their own lane. If anyone was to rashly barge into the territory of another force, the lightest punishment would be being banished and kicked out, while the heavy punishment would be getting thoroughly beaten.

There was nothing else that could be done. Previously, in order to contend for Heavenly Venerable Seals, an irrecoverable barrier had already formed among the great Heavenly Venerates. How could they treat each other as brothers just because they were now fighting side by side?

Although close to 90% of the Heavenly Venerates had gathered here, it was completely silent beneath the city wall. The majority of them were cultivating in their own residences, trying to make themselves a little bit stronger in preparation for the next wave of attack from Hysteria’s army.

Perhaps one would be able to survive just because one became a wee bit stronger.

The city wall was very long, but with the pace of Heavenly Venerates, it only took a while to close the distance.

In under 30 minutes, the trio had already arrived at the territory of the World Alliance.

Ling Han stopped in his tracks, and did not continue forward. He turned around.

On one side of the city wall, there was a large group of buildings, which was the territory marked by the World Alliance.

Ling Han strode forwards, heading towards the group of buildings.

Immediately, someone shouted, “Halt!”

Had they walked by the city wall, no one would have cared, but it was different here. This was the territory that had already been demarcated by the World Alliance.

Ling Han looked over in the man’s direction.

“Wu.” That person immediately clutched at his chest with one hand, and blood was dripping from all his apertures.

This man was only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so how could he possibly withstand the might of his gaze?

If it were not for the fact that Ling Han did not want to kill him, this guy would have already died. Even so, he had also been severely injured. Without a few hundred million years of rest, it would be impossible for him to recover.

Ling Han continued to walk forward, but immediately three more people jumped out and appeared in front of him.

However, these three people did not make a move, because they knew who Ling Han was. They were definitely no match for him.

“Ling Han, how dare you barge into the territory of the World Alliance!” a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate called out.

Ling Han looked towards this Heavenly Venerate, and did not speak, but a frightening aura spread out, bearing an indescribable pressure on that person.

“Ah!” the Second Tier screamed involuntarily and staggered a few steps backwards, also bleeding from all his apertures, having been severely injured.

In front of Ling Han, what difference was there between a Second Tier and a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Both would be unable to withstand even a single strike!

This astounded the other two people. Not everyone had personally witnessed Ling Han’s powerful battle prowess, and they kept feeling that the rumors were slightly exaggerated. How could a Third Tier be as powerful as this?

Now that they had seen it with their own eyes, they realized that Ling Han was indeed freakish, even surpassing the rumors.

They didn’t dare to say anything else. Who would want to suffer for nothing?

In any case, they were no match for Ling Han. And since they were no match for him, what need was there for them to seek their own suffering?

Peng! Peng!

However, Ling Han had no intention of letting them off the hook. With a punch, the two of them were instantly sent flying through the air, knocking down who knew how many walls along the way.

The two of them were extremely depressed. They had not spoken out of turn, so why did they still need to suffer a blow?

...

Didn’t you come here to find Feng Wuding? Why did you make a move on them?

They couldn’t get up, as they were already severely injured by Ling Han’s strike.

Ling Han’s expression was cold. He had not come today to spar with Feng Wuding, and see who was the strongest prodigy in history. He had come to beat someone up to vent his anger.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! More Heavenly Venerates leaped out, surrounding Ling Han, yet none of them made a move.

Even in the World Alliance, there were not many Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates. The rest were mediocre, so how could they possibly stop Ling Han?

Hence, not a single one of them sought their own humiliation.

Ling Han clenched his right hand into a fist and threw out a punch.

“What?!”

“You actually dare to take the initiative to attack?”

“How arrogant!”

Everyone was exclaiming in shock. They had not thought that Ling Han would be so arrogant, and would be so overbearing even when he had barged into the territory of the World Alliance.

...

They all moved to parry, but even if there were several dozen Heavenly Venerates, taking this blow head-on still forced them all backwards.

Why was it so difficult to advance to the Fifth Tier?

This was because one would have surpassed the Fourth Tier by who knew how many times in taking this step.

When Ling Han threw out a punch, his fist was unstoppable.
