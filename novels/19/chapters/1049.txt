Chapter 1050: Sudden Elevation

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Yang Luodan was simply flattering Zhao Lun, most of what she said was still very true. Reaching the Sun Moon Tier at an age as young as Zhao Lun’s was tremendously rare!

Of course, this was in part due to Great General Zhao’s sacrifices—he had even suffered severe wounds to help his son. At his cultivation level, severe wounds weren’t something that could be healed after eating a few pills and resting for a few days. Rather, he needed centuries or even millennia of rest to allow his wounds to slowly recover.

However, the most important factor was still Zhao Lun’s prodigious talent. After all, there was still the other six Great Generals and the Left and Right Minister, but who could raise a child as impressive as Zhao Lun?

Zhao Lun instantly calmed down. ‘That’s right! My strength has always been far above Ling Han’s, so why do I need to keep that ant in mind?’

There had never been any notion of fairness in the cultivation world—strength was all that mattered. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yanyu, I’ll propose our marriage to the Shui Clan once this battle is over!” Zhao Lun said calmly. He had already given Shui Yanyu enough freedom. Since he had already reached the Sun Moon Tier, it was high time that he took this seductive beauty as wife.

“Heir Zhao, don’t forget that I’m already part of the Ling Family! I’ll never fathom marrying a second husband, so please don’t bother me anymore!”

Zhao Lun chuckled coldly, and said, “What’s the point of staying with a dead person?”

“Ignore him! Let’s go!” Li Weiwei dragged Shui Yanyu to a relatively distant place to sit down.

“Brother Zhao, let’s sit down as well.” Yang Luodan also went to tug at Zhao Lun.

Zhao Lun humphed and snatched his arm away, completely ignoring Yang Luodan as he sat down by himself.

Jealousy creeped into Yang Luodan’s heart.

She knew that Zhao Lun would definitely do everything within his abilities to please her if she were Shui Yanyu. If it were her, how could he wear such a frosty expression? Yang Luodan was angry, yet she didn’t let her emotions show.

‘Once Ling Han dies, all of the clues will point toward Shui Yanyu. How is she going to escape this perilous situation?’

One had to remember that the Ninth King had quite a close relationship with Ling Han. Thus, even the Shui Clan wouldn’t be able to protect Shui Yanyu.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and Wu Ziren were both standing in the arena, ready to do battle.

Wu Ziren looked extremely ordinary. He was around 30 years old, and was neither tall nor sturdy. His hair was disheveled, and his eyes also appeared to be a little lifeless. If the audience hadn’t witnessed his might with their own eyes, who would have believed that he was a supreme prodigy who could crush those of the same generation as him?

His cultivation level was only at the late stage of the medium extreme, yet he had defeated elites who were already at the peak stage of the high extreme. His battle prowess could surpass five stars!

This was genuinely stunning. One had to realize that the battle prowess of the Seven Generals and the Left and Right Minister could only surpass four stars. If they wanted to surpass five stars, they would need to draw on the power of the nation. However, Wu Ziren could surpass five stars through his own power alone!

Many forces had already tried to recruit him in the past few days, with the amount of attention that he drew being no lower than that of Ling Han. It was just that he hadn’t express his own intentions the entire time.

“Please, you first.” Ling Han gestured with his hand.

A resolute expression appeared on Wu Ziren’s face. He had already received an order that required him to dispose of the opponent before him in 10 exchanges. However, this meant that he also had to sacrifice his life.

“Please!” he said in a raspy voice.

Pa, pa, pa!

The bones in his body crackled as he twisted his neck. Meanwhile, his body became significantly larger, and continued growing. Wisps of black aura surged from his body.

His appearance had seemed ordinary before, yet it became especially sinister now. It was as if he had descended into a Demonic Dao.

Boom!

His aura suddenly grew explosively. It had only been at the late stage of the medium extreme before, yet it rapidly surpassed the high extreme and consummate level. Even so, it still continued to grow ferociously.

“How is this possible?!”

“Isn’t he at the medium extreme? How has his aura suddenly surpassed the consummate level?”

“His aura shouldn’t grow so much even if he’s breaking through on the spot! Anyhow, there should appear heavenly tribulation if he was genuinely breaking through.”

“Gasp! What kind of secret technique can allow one to grow two minor levels and surpass at least nine stars?”

“It’s more than nine stars! The might of his aura isn’t as simple as the peak stage of the consummate level. In fact, it’s soaring toward the pseudo-Sun Moon Tier!”

“It’s 10 stars, perhaps even 11 stars!”

“Impossible! Definitely impossible! Even five-star geniuses only exist in legends. Six-star geniuses are more so unheard of, so how can there be a 10- or even 11-star genius?”

“Heh, six-star geniuses do indeed exist! When this old man was still young, I once went to the Two Realm Battlefield to cultivate my skills. I saw a six-star genius there, and even heard of the existence of a seven-star genius. The reason why such geniuses don’t exist here is because the cultivation level of the Joint Peace Planet is merely capped at the Heavenly Body Tier.”

“No, no, no, this person is definitely not a 10-star genius. His original cultivation level is already at the peak stage of the consummate level. It’s just that he used some secret technique to change his aura. Right now, he’s simply using some other secret technique to forcefully raise his battle prowess.”

There were a dozen or so Sun Moon Tier elites seated somewhere in the stands and discussing something among themselves.

One of the elders had remained silent the entire time. However, an expression of pure shock suddenly spread across his face, and he yelped, “Demonic Qi!”

“Elder An, what’s Demonic Qi?” the other Sun Moon Tier elites asked. They all seemed very respectful toward this elder.

This elder’s surname was An, and he was an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. He was a top-echelon elite even in the Imperial Capital of the Majestic Empire. Only a tiny number of people had a higher cultivation level or status than him—the Seven Generals, the Left and Right Minister, the Nine Kings, and Empress Luan Xing.

Moreover, this Elder An was indeed old enough as well. He had traveled far and wide when he was young, and he had even traveled beyond the Joint Peace Planet before. His experiences were especially rich.

“I’m sure you all know that there’s a Netherworld in addition to our Immortal Realm, right?” Elder An didn’t answer their question, and instead asked a question back at them.

The elites around him nodded. They had indeed heard that there were weak points between the two realms located on other planets. These weak points formed passageways, and it was in these passageways that the elites of the Immortal Realm and Netherworld would engage in intense and bloody battles.

The Joint Peace Planet was extremely fortunate, and didn’t possess any such weak point. Otherwise, how could there be conflict between the three Majestic Empires? If there were a weak point, all of their time and resources would be spent on defending against the Netherworld.

“The wisps of black aura radiating from that person’s body... are none other than Demonic Qi!” Elder An’s voice was extremely certain, and he continued, “Back when I was young, I once traveled to the Two Realm Battlefield and fought against many cultivators from the Netherworld. Thus, I’m especially familiar with Demonic Qi.”

“What?! That person is actually a cultivator from the Netherworld?” Those around Elder An all exclaimed in surprise. This was a stunning turn of events. If a warrior from the Netherworld appeared here, did that mean that the Joint Peace Planet also had a passageway that linked the two realms?

“No, that person is most likely from the Immortal Realm. However, Demonic Qi has been sealed into his body. Strange... When I was still at the Two Realm Battlefield, I often saw people investigating Demonic Qi. However, those who tried to absorb Demonic Qi into their bodies would only end up dying. The Regulations of the Netherworld are completely different from those of the Immortal Realm, with each opposing the other. Trying to have them coexist is simply impossible.”

There was a look of surprise and confusion on Elder An’s face.

“Should we stop the battle?” someone asked.

Another person immediately shook their head, and said, “In order to achieve their so-called fairness, the Iron Blood Stadium seals the entire battlefield once the battle begins. Breaking this seal will take quite a while, even for someone at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. Only great elites at the Heavenly Body Tier can break this seal quickly!”

However, this was merely a battle between two cultivators at the Mountain River Tier, so how could it attract great elites at the Heavenly Body Tier?

“That’s right!” Elder An suddenly clapped his hands together and stood up, saying, “Although I don’t know how he did it, I’m certain that he’s taking advantage of the conflict between his body and the Demonic Qi to forcefully raise his battle prowess. However, the price of doing this... is definitely tremendous!”
