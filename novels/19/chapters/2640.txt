Chapter 2641: The Counterattack Begins

Niu Cangyu and the others all fought to unleash powerful attacks. None of them urged Gu Heyi to help them.

They naturally all had their own plans. As long as they killed Ling Han and immediately snatched the Dimension Scroll, if they obtained the blessing of heaven and earth, they could immediately become a Heavenly Venerate. At that time, how could this prison trap them?

As such, it was good that Gu Heyi wasn’t attacking. This meant that there was one less competitor—the most powerful one at that. Moreover, Ling Han was already a spent force, so the five of them were more than powerful enough to kill him.

Ling Han held the Dimension Scroll with his left hand, continuing to extract its power. Meanwhile, he held the Divine Demon Sword with his right hand, slashing and hacking and creating space for himself.

!!

“How is he still not dead?” After battling for a while, Niu Cangyu and the others found it strange that Ling Han was still alive. In his state, he should have fallen over and died at any moment, so how was he still resisting with such toughness?

Gu Heyi finally charged forward. After observing the battle for so long, he believed that he had noticed some weaknesses. “I don’t know how he’s doing it, but he’s able to wield some of the power of the Dimension Scroll. It’s because of this that he can still resist.

“Don’t hold back. Once we knock the Dimension Scroll out of his hands, he’ll become nothing but lamb for slaughter!”

After hearing this “hint” and encouragement, Niu Cangyu and the others immediately rediscovered their confidence. They continued to attack.

The six elites unleashed their furious and relentless attacks, completely suppressing Ling Han.

They were clearly enjoying an absolute advantage, yet they were unable to turn this advantage into victory no matter what they did. In their eyes, Ling Han was far too stubborn. No matter how they attacked him, once their attacks weakened a little, Ling Han would immediately recover to his original state. They couldn’t kill him no matter what.

“Brat, why let yourself suffer so much?” They started to play a mental game.

“You can’t escape death, so why don’t you choose a swifter and less painful death?”

“Your wounds are too severe; it’s impossible for you to turn the tables!”

However, Ling Han remained unfazed. His eyes remained looking down, not allowing the six people to see the killing intent hidden within them.

“You’re too stubborn!”

“Even if this takes 100 years, we’re still going to kill this brat!”

With the enticement of the Dimension Scroll, Niu Cangyu and the others naturally couldn’t give up halfway. After all, the Dimension Scroll was already valuable enough for them to risk their lives, and they were more so affected by the black energy at this moment. Thus, they were naturally even more crazed and frenzied than normal.

The battle continued, and they all unleashed their most powerful attacks at Ling Han.

Time slowly crept by. Just like they had predicted, one year quickly passed by. Then another year, 10 years, 30 years… Not only had they battled for 100 years, but the battle still continued.

To Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, battling for tens of thousands of years was nothing too surprising. However, the stubbornness of their opponent and his refusal to accept death was still enough to make them feel a sense of exasperation and apprehension.

This young man was truly far too terrifying. If he were truly allowed to stabilize his cultivation, who at the Eighth Heaven could hope to wound him?

However, the more this was the case, the more desperate they were to kill Ling Han. If they didn’t remove this nail from their eyes, they wouldn’t be able to feel at ease. Moreover, there was still the attraction of the Dimension Scroll.

100 years, 150 years, 170 years!

Ling Han suddenly stopped, not dodging anymore.

“Haha! Have you finally accepted your fate?” Fu Yunhai said with loud laughter. He lunged forward, throwing a fist at Ling Han’s forehead. Meanwhile, his left hand clawed at the Dimension Scroll.

He was going to kill Ling Han and snatch the Dimension Scroll in a single breath. Once he obtained the Dimension Scroll, he could immediately become a Heavenly Venerate. At that time, he could dominate the entire Celestial King Graveyard without a worry in his mind.

Of course, he didn’t for a second consider that he might not be the person chosen by heaven and earth.

He refused to accept this possibility.

Fu Yunhai’s punch arrived, and a smile stretched across his face. Success was imminent.

Niu Cangyu and the others had initially thought that this was a trap by Ling Han. However, upon seeing him remain still even as the fist arrived, they involuntarily started to regret their decision to hold back. By the looks of it, Ling Han had truly given up.

They hurriedly lunged forward. Even if they were slower, they still had to fight for the Dimension Scroll.

Peng!

Ling Han suddenly unleashed a fearsome punch. In this instant, he didn’t control his power anymore.

Boom!

Like a crashing tsunami, an overwhelming power surged forth with vigor and violence.

His attack had come later, yet it arrived first. This was the specialty of Body Arts—explosive power. Fu Yunhai wore an expression of deep shock and disbelief as the fist smashed into his face.

Pu!

The fist sunk deep into his head before exiting through the back.

Shield of Origin Power? It was as futile as a sheet of paper!

Fu Yunhai was unable to even put up a struggle as his mind was immediately obliterated, dying in an instant.

His limbs became limp as he hung on Ling Han’s fist.

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’

Niu Cangyu and the others became pale with terror. How would they still dare to attack? They desperately tried to stop in their tracks. However, they had all been charging forward to fight for the Dimension Scroll just then, and they had all been doing so with all their strength. Thus, how could they halt this momentum?

This was a hilarious sight. The four elites were charging toward Ling Han, yet they all wore expressions of absolute terror, with their hands and feet furiously flailing in an attempt to stop themselves.

However, no one could laugh out loud. This was because they had witnessed the grisly sight of Fu Yunhai’s head being obliterated. This had stunned them into silence, and they still had yet to regain their composure.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han unleashed four punches in a row, sending Niu Cangyu and the others flying. Fortunately, they were defending with all their might, so they weren’t easily killed like Fu Yunhai. They only vomited blood, and they weren’t smashed into smithereens.

Gu Heyi also ground to a halt, his face filled with astonishment. He was unable to accept the reality of Ling Han suddenly becoming so fearsome. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You endured this entire time just to unleash your power at this moment?” he asked in a solemn voice.

Ling Han replied with a faint smile. This person was smarter than the others, correctly guessing his intentions.

When extracting power from the Dimension Scroll, he could actually unleash this power in an instant. However, if he did so, the six people would definitely flee upon noticing the changing situation. In that case, he would only be able to kill one or two of them at most. He wouldn’t be able to kill all of them.

Thus, he decided to endure, not unleashing the power that he had obtained. Only at this moment did he finally unleash it.

“…You did this because you want to kill all of us!” Gu Heyi exclaimed, his voice quivering slightly. He could only think of a single possibility.

Ling Han applauded, saying, “Correct.”

With a flick of his hands, Fu Yunhai’s corpse was instantly tossed into the distance.

Peng!

He collapsed to the ground like a heap of trash.

Gu Heyi sucked in a sharp breath, Diao You started to wipe his cold sweat, Niu Cangyu felt his knees shaking, and Xue Chengbai felt his heart contracting… The person before them was far too terrifying. In order to kill them all, he had actually chosen to endure so much. Had he not been afraid of slipping up and being killed?

However, he had indeed endured until this moment. Now… it was their turn to be hunted.

‘Flee!’

Their eyes flickered, yet none of them moved. This was because the first person to flee would definitely be the first person to be targeted by Ling Han. That would only result in death, and it would create an opportunity for the others to escape.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He held up the Dimension Scroll and waved it around, saying, “You guys want it?”

Niu Cangyu, Rong Wenlin, and Xue Chengbai immediately shook their heads. However, Diao You was unwilling to be toyed around with by Ling Han, or perhaps he had more of a backbone than the others, and he said, “So what if I want it? Are you willing to give it to me?”

“Sure!” With a flick of his hands, Ling Han genuinely tossed the Dimension Scroll toward Diao You.

Dimension Scroll instinctively caught it. Only when he gripped the Dimension Scroll firmly did he finally come to his senses. Delight swept over him, and he was so overjoyed that he couldn’t even speak.

Th-th-this… How could such a wonderful thing occur? Had Ling Han’s brain been damaged?
