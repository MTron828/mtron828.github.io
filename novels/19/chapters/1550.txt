1551 Son of a Demon Master

Xiu!

Right at this moment, a majestic light suddenly shot over from afar. Peng, a massive sound rang out from the mountain peak. That came from the majestic light crashing onto the mountain.

As the light dispersed, a youth was presently standing proudly there. His face was handsome, yet he had a pair of silver cat’s ears, which was quite... adorable. Some men whose sexual inclinations were not that firm would probably be completely bent at the sight of him.

“How dare you!” Immediately, a few people shouted in rebuke. How could he ignore the rules like this? Could it be that just anyone could simply come up here like this? Those that could stand here had all used their abilities to prove that they were worthy.

This youth definitely did not have that kind of qualification, because he was only in the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Get lost!” Those few people immediately moved.

“Ha!” A light exclamation, and peng, peng, peng, human figures were sent flying. It was those people that had made a move that were sent flying, like flowers being scattered by a celestial maiden. Another person appeared. This person had a slender, tall figure and a head of silver locks. The eyes were also silver, releasing a bewitching charm.

This was a person whose gender was difficult to distinguish. Wearing loose white robes, the figure was not clearly seen, and the facial features were also incredibly neutral.

“Mo Li!” When they saw this person, a considerable number of people exclaimed in trembling voices.

If one were to ask whether it was the Overlord Sword Demon Master stronger or the Hysteria Demon Master stronger in the Aurora Galaxy, that was something that had never been concluded, because the two great Demon Masters had sparred for who knew how many rounds, yet it always ended in a tie.

But in the Eternal River Tier, if Mo Li claimed to be second, there would definitely be no one who dared say he was first.

He was a publicly acknowledged young king tier invincible in the Eternal River Tier, and he had an above 30% chance of advancing into the Genesis Tier. Don’t think that 30% chance was too small. In truth, not one person among those in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier dared to say that they had a certain chance of becoming a Demon Master.

Mo Li’s superior talent and strong abilities were evidently extraordinary.

And he also had another identity—the personal disciple of the Hysteria Demon Master.

It was not strange for him to come here. After a few more days, the Overlord Sword Demon Master would be sparring with the Hysteria Demon Master. As the personal disciple of the latter, wasn’t it very normal for him to come along? Moreover, observing the battle between Demon Masters was also greatly beneficial for his breaking through to the Genesis Tier.

Ling Han’s eyes tensed. This Mo Li made him feel a very strong pressure. He was definitely not weaker than big shots like Ren Feiyun and Cai Miao. In fact, it was even possible that he was slightly stronger than them.

But what he was more curious about was whether this Mo Li was male or female.

This was probably a matter that a great many people were curious about because Mo Li had never clearly confirmed his or her gender.

The cat-eared youth walked over, and smiled at Mo Li. Then, he looked at Zhu Xuan and said, “So you are the Overlord Sword Demon Master’s daughter, Zhu Xuan?”

Zhu Xuan glanced at Mo Li, and then nodded, and answered, “That’s right, who are you?”

“My name is Wu Jue, and my father is the Hysteria Demon Master,” the cat-eared youth replied.

Everyone suddenly gave an ‘oh’. No wonder Mo Li had moved; this was his (her) junior brother.

Zhu Xuan wrinkled her nose in a frown. She very much disliked the arrogance of this youth.

“The reason why I have come is to see how my betrothed looks like. If she looks ugly, I will definitely not marry her!” Wu Jue looked Zhu Xuan over from top to bottom. “Looks okay, but seems like the waist is a little wide.”

Those last words were directed to Mo Li.

Mo Li’s expression was wooden, and he answered, “It’s not her waist that is wide, but her behind is too small, which is why her waist has lost its curve.”

His voice was also extremely neutral, and one was still unable to distinguish his gender from his voice.

Pu!

A great many people spluttered in laughter. Though this Mo Li’s behavior was cold, his words were really enough to cause someone to die in fury. Zhu Xuan’s pretty face was already bright red in embarrassment. Her right hand tightly gripped her sword. She wanted to commit murder.

Wu Jue meanwhile nodded his head, and said, “I see!”

“En!” Mo Li was very sure.

“The two of you... have you said enough?!” Zhu Xuan squeezed out through gritted teeth, a vein popping on her hand that was gripping tightly onto her sword.

“Barely adequate.” Wu Jue’s mouth twitched, and then said, “Then you... I will just tolerate recognizing you as my betrothed!”

“Absolute nonsense!” Zhu Xuan took a look at Ling Han, and as if fearing that he would misunderstand, she hurriedly exclaimed, “Who is your betrothed here!”

“Your father made a bet and lost to my father, and the stake was you,” Wu Jue said. He spread out his hands, and sighed. “Sigh, really, I am so free and happy being on my own, so why did he have to find a betrothed for me?”

Lost a bet?

Zhu Xuan’s heart clenched, and she exclaimed, “Stop babbling nonsense, how could my father possibly lose to Lord Hysteria!”

Mo Li interrupted, and said, “The wager hasn’t begun yet. It will only be decided tomorrow when the two lords spar.”

Zhu Xuan’s heart suddenly calmed down. The two Demon Masters had to be using the battle’s victor to decide the matrimony between her and Wu Jue, but obviously her father could not possibly lose. She humphed, and proudly declared, “In your dreams!”

Yet Mo Li said, “Junior Sister Zhu, Lord Overlord Sword wagered that he could defeat my master this time; if not, he would betroth Junior Sister Zhu to my junior brother. Obviously, this is already a decided matter.”

Clearly, it was practically an impossible feat for Overlord Sword Demon Master to defeat Hysteria Demon Master, but it was also the same for the latter to defeat the former.

Zhu Xuan suddenly paled. Her father was really too self-confident this time round; he was so confident that he was going to drag her into the bargain!

Wu Jue gave a yawn, and looked towards Ling Han. Previously, he had seen Zhu Xuan casting a few looks at Ling Han. At first, he did not have to be concerned about that, but who asked this girl to have become his betrothed?

‘Hmm?’

He involuntarily stared at Ling Han, and after studying him for a while, he said, “You... look a little familiar.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ling Han paused. He had never come to the Netherworld, so how could he possibly meet the son of a Demon Master? He smiled calmly, and said, “When have we met before?”

“It is this smile, especially asking to be beaten! Especially detestable! I definitely have seen this smile before!” Wu Jue pointed at Ling Han, looking as if someone had stepped on his tail.

A muscle involuntarily twitched in Ling Han’s cheek. Being able to say such words, he clearly was very familiar with him. Strange, he really had never seen this youth before, how did he cause the latter to be fuming with rage like this?

Right, he had eaten one of the chickens of a Demon Master’s daughter, and now had become the target of the son of another Demon Master; was he really that unfortunate?

“It’s you! It’s you!” Wu Jue suddenly leaped up, and took a quick step forwards, his fist crashing down on Ling Han.

So inexplicable!

Ling Han gave a light shove, and swept Wu Jue backwards. Smiling, he said, “Kid, you are no match for me. Your senior brother would be a better match.”

Wu Jue had been too excited, so he had rushed forwards in a moment of impulse. Moreover, with Mo Li standing behind him, he was naturally unafraid. He hurriedly turned around, and declared, “Mo Li, get revenge for me!”

“What did he do to you?” Mo Li asked calmly, having no apparent ire.

Wu Jue’s face suddenly flushed, looking completely like a little wife that had been terribly bullied, yet he was reluctant to say anything.

It was Ling Han who became anxious instead, and he exclaimed, “Hey, hey, hey, can’t you speak nicely? This look of yours would make others misunderstand that I did something to you!”
