Chapter 2576: Limits

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After the man had said these words, everyone bore a strange expression.

Yang Xiaoling had indeed fulfilled her promise, and was “making a move” on Ling Han.

Ling Han did not know who Yang Xiaoling was, and couldn’t help but look towards Tang Yuan, asking, “Who is Yang Xiaoling?”

Tang Yuan patted Ling Han’s shoulder. “You’ll find out when you get there! However, let me warn you, Big Sister Ling’s temper is even hotter than mine. You must not anger her, or you will definitely be in trouble.”

Though Ling Han was not afraid, he was internally surprised. It looked like this Yang Xiaoling had even greater power than Tang Yuan, and that was why she could summon him as she liked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was curious internally, and thus nodded, setting out with the man who had come.

Very soon, they arrived at a courtyard. The visitor led the way ahead, and brought Ling Han to a massive great hall.

This should be a bathroom because there was a colossal bath in the ground, occupying 80% of the space of the entire room. Hot water filled the bath, steam wafting upwards. Petals floated on the surface of the water, lightly moving with the waves.

A woman was seated in the bath, and two maids were washing her hair. Her ink-black hair could reach her waist, and now it was moving with the waves like water plants.

This woman had her back turned on Ling Han, so Ling Han could only see her snow-white back, but there was a flower tattooed there. Ling Han could not distinguish what type of flower it was, because he had not been very long in this dimension.

“Lady Ling, Li Long is here.” The man knelt on the ground with his eyes lowered, not daring to allow his gaze to wander the slightest bit.

“En, leave us,” the woman with her back turned on him said, her voice seductive and graceful.

“Understood.” The man immediately retreated out, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.

Huala, the sound of water splashing rang out. That woman turned around, revealing a seductive, captivating face, and she was completely unconcerned that Ling Han could see the alluring beauty of her breasts. Not only did she not bother to try to conceal them, she instead stuck them out even further, making them look even more erect.

“Am I beautiful?” she asked.

This woman naturally was Yang Xiaoling.

Ling Han smiled naturally, and replied, “Very beautiful.”

These were honest words. The woman was indeed very beautiful. Though her beauty had not reached the extent of the Empress’, she could still be considered an outstanding beauty, especially that kind of dazzling beauty that carried thorns. It was indeed something that would make one’s heart beat wildly.

Of course, this much definitely was incapable of moving his heart.

Yang Xiaoling broke into a loud laughter, appearing wild and unconstrained. She hooked a finger at Ling Han. “Then what are you still standing around for? Come over quickly. Could it be that you are not a man?”

Though she was saying such bold words, the two maids only acted as if they heard nothing. There was no change to their expressions, and they merely continued their respective tasks.

Ling Han shook his head. “Apologies, I am already married.”

“So what?” Yang Xiaoling was still smiling extremely boldly. “You think that I have set my eyes on you, and wish to spend the rest of my life with you? You are overthinking things, and think far too highly of yourself. I only wish to play around with you.”

Ling Han was surprised. This woman actually enjoyed playing with men?

Immediately, he laughed in spite of himself. Men could play around with women, so why couldn’t women with power and ability play around with men? What more when it was in this kind of bizarre place?

This had nothing to do with him.

“If I do not go along with you, could it be that you plan to force me?” Ling Han said, smiling in spite of himself.

Yang Xiaoling laughed loudly. “Do you think that only men can force women? Wrong, wrong! Though you are a new Blood Martial King, and have extremely strong battle prowess, you are still just in the Third Heaven, after all. Could you be a match for Seventh Heaven or Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings?

“My father is a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and as long as he moves, he can instantly destroy you.

“Faced with death, will you obey or disobey?”

Ling Han broke into a grin. In this place, he would repress all his temper, but would never abandon his limits.

For him to bed another woman in order to preserve his own life, and he even had to play the role of the one being played around with?

That was simply impossible.

He shook his head. “Miss Yang had best find someone else. I have no interest in that.”

He turned around and left.

“Stop right there!” Yang Xiaoling suddenly stood up.?Huala, splashes rang out. She pointed a finger at Ling Han. “If you dare to walk out these doors, I guarantee that you will have a tragic end!”

Ling Han ignored her, walking onwards smoothly.

“Come—”

“Report!”

Yang Xiaoling was just about to speak when a Celestial King suddenly burst through the doors. He knelt on the ground, interrupting what she was about to say.

“What is it!!” she demanded impatiently.

“Lord Yang Que summons!” this Celestial King said.

Yang Xiaoling’s face involuntarily paled, fear flashing through her eyes. She paused for at least a breath’s time, and replied, “I understand.”

That Celestial King waited for a moment, and then continued, “My lord has said that Young Miss should set everything aside, and immediately set out.”

Yang Xiaoling took a deep breath, and said darkly, “I already said, I understood!”

Only then did this Celestial King not continue to speak, but he was still kneeling on the ground. Clearly, as long as Yang Xiaoling was not moving, he would continue kneeling there.

“Robe me!” Yang Xiaoling spread out her arms, and the two maids hurriedly took robes and helped her dress.

“Let’s go!” She humphed, and glared harshly at that Celestial King, almost shooting out a kick at him.

Ling Han could vaguely hear something, but naturally would not be taking it to heart. He returned to Tang Yuan’s courtyard because he wanted to get himself an Ascending Dragon Pill, and study just what kind of ingredients were used to concoct it.

“Yi, why have you returned so quickly?” When Tang Yuan saw Ling Han, he was instantly filled with surprise.

It should be known that there was no possibility for any men that this poisonous spider had played with before to even stand up without lying on the bed for half a year or so. He had already prepared himself. When Ling Han was taken back, he would allow him to rest for eight to 10 years, and only then would he have him challenge Lu Li’s Blood Martial King.

Yet Ling Han had actually walked back on his own. This really caused him extreme shock.

Ling Han merely smiled, and asked, “The Ascending Dragon Pill?”

Tang Yuan instantly frowned. These words from Ling Han displeased him greatly. ‘Who do you think you are that you can use such a tone to speak to me?’

“Li Long, do you think that just because you have become a Blood Martial King, you can disrespect Young Master Tang?” Luo Yang immediately leaped out, pointing at Ling Han. “Ptui, you are even less than nothing in front of Young Master Tang!

“Kneel down quickly, and beg Young Master Tang for forgiveness!”

Ling Han turned to look at Luo Yang, and asked, “Looks like you truly have forgotten the pain now that your injuries have recovered. Do you want to die?”

“Li Long, you are too arrogant!” Luo Yang said sinisterly. He did not mind pouring oil on the flames, and making it so that Ling Han would fall out completely with Tang Yuan.

“Try and say that again,” Ling Han said smilingly.

“You ignorant, stupid—”

Peng!

Ling Han moved, blasting Luo Yang’s head into bits with a single punch. That headless body was still pointing at him, looking slightly funny, but at the same time very bizarre.

Luo Yang had provoked Ling Han repeatedly. Did he think that the latter was a pushover?

Pu, the spray of blood splattered onto Tang Yuan, causing him to shudder strongly.

He had a surreal feeling, as if he was living in a dream. Ling Han actually dared commit murder right in front of him. Furthermore, the victim was one of his lackeys at that, the son of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King!

Hiss, could it be that this world had gone mad?

First, there was A’Yuan, and now came Ling Han. They all did not pay any attention to second-generation young masters and misses like them?
