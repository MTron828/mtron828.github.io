Chapter 2237: Standing off against the heavens

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This was a giant creature thousands of meters tall. It looked like a whale, but had a pair of wings. They were not the wings of a bird, but the fleshy wings of a bat. There were also tiny?claws1?sprouting from the wings, covered with black scales and resembling supreme Divine Metal.

“This is that great beast?” Ling Han and his group all mumbled.

This great beast was a combination of the unique traits of the creatures of both Celestial Realm and Foreign Realm. For example, this whale was a form of the Celestial Realm, but the bat-like wings were unique to the Foreign Realm.

The great beast roared furiously at the skies, its voice turning into a massive wave that blasted out in all directions.

Ling Han and the Rain Emperor exchanged looks, and then shot out, pushing out their hands at the skies.

Boom, the sound wave was already assaulting, immediately pushing them into a backwards slide.

Both of them released furious roars as well, bursting out with astonishing power, propping up a safe space, and protecting Hu Niu and the other women.

Shua, shua, shua.?The fabric covering their arms was instantly ripped into shreds, and multiple wounds appeared on their arms, which was quickly followed by the raising of pieces of flesh and blood, revealing eerily white bone.

This was too terrifying. The great beast had merely roared, and already had such might. Even two great Monarch Stars were placed under such strain.

Thankfully, the sound wave finally passed over.

Even Ling Han and the Rain Emperor seemed like they were about to collapse, but it was only for a moment. Not only had they exhausted the majority of the power of Regulation in their bodies, even the Dragon Qi that they had previously accumulated through the Dragon Transformation Technique was completely exhausted.

“The strength of this great beast far surpasses an ordinary Ascending Origin Tier!” Ling Han said with absolute certainty. It was not that he had never seen an Ascending Origin Tier move, but their strength was who knew how inferior as compared to this great beast.

“It very possibly is the king of this land, and was originally destined to reign over all living creatures,” the Empress said slowly.

This great beast really had very bad luck to actually encounter a Four-Star Alchemist like Ling Han, who had “rushed its growth” at all costs. As a result, it was now targeted by the Regulations of the heaven and earth wanting to erase its existence.

It was too strong, and the Regulations would not permit that.

“Now the valley has turned into an ocean of flames, fused with the Regulations of the two Realms, and we can’t approach, either. How will we be able to retrieve the corpse of this great beast then?” Ling Han asked, stuck in a dilemma.

They had paid such a heavy price, so if they really got nothing out of it, it would be much too great a loss.

“We can only wait.”

The great beast’s strength was incredibly powerful. It was defying the heavens, wanting to cut out a path of survival for itself.

“Say, if it didn’t die, would it become the Heavenly Venerate of this heaven and earth?” Ling Han suddenly asked out of nowhere. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This great beast’s strength had already surpassed the limits of the Regulations. If even the Regulations could do nothing against it, it would be able to ignore the Regulations. Then, wouldn’t that be a Heavenly Venerate? However, with the different level of the heaven and earth here, the strength of Heavenly Venerable Tier would also be different.

…A Heavenly Venerate here would only be the level of the Celestial King Tier.

But if this great beast managed to survive, it would definitely be nothing that the five of them could match. They would only be able to give up any idea of obtaining treasures from it.

“Sigh!” Ling Han sighed.

“Sigh!” Hu Niu sighed as well.

“Sigh!”

“Sigh!”

“Sigh!”

All five of them were feeling very gloomy. At first, they had wanted to make some profit, but they had not expected that this would be the actual result.

“Great beast, great beast, please, please die!” Hu Niu placed her hands together, her expression extremely sincere. “Niu still wants to have a taste of your flesh. You must not disappoint Niu, or Niu will curse you to be single for life.”

The other four immediately laughed at this. Hu Niu was still Hu Niu. Her thought processes were always different from the rest.

The great beast battled the heavens. It brandished its wings, creating wild winds with every rise and fall, and turning them into blades of wind that swept towards the skies, tearing through the flames by force.

So strong.

“Could it really defy the heavens, and even destroy the heavenly tribulation?” The five of them were all worried.

Thankfully, though the fiery clouds had been broken up, even more fiery clouds rolled out very soon, forming a frightening assault.

The power of man was limited, but the power of heaven and earth was without bounds.

The great beast held on stubbornly, its ways endless. It could control the various Regulations of Water, Fire, Lightning, Metal, and so on, plus other Regulations that Ling Han and his group could not understand. These should be Regulations of the Foreign Realm.

But no matter how it struggled, the power of heaven and earth was always stronger.

In the pond of this heaven and earth, all existences would only be tiny fish. How could they possibly stand off against the heaven and earth?

This great beast began to sustain injuries, dripping blood from all over its body, and its blood was actually inky green in color, possessing astonishing life energy. As it splattered onto the ground, there would actually be grass struggling to sprout in those spots. Then, the blood would take form, and assume the forms of small deer, puppies, and so on, running around all over.

Ling Han and the others were all watching dumbstruck. This great beast was definitely an amazing Great Herb; its life energy was too boundless.

“That’s not certain.” The Rain Emperor immediately rained on the parade. “The Regulations of the two Realms are different, and the blood of the great beast may be a supreme tonic for this land, but for us, it could be poison.”

True, Ling Han and the others all nodded. Because the poison that they had concocted was a shockingly effective tonic for the great beast, it might be that its blood and flesh would be a powerful poison for them.

“Still, the life energy of that great beast is so strong that even its blood can manifest into other living creatures. This is the power of Creation.”

“Exactly what kind of existence is it?”

Having surpassed the limits of Regulations, it was still alive, and its blood could form living creatures. This was too unimaginable.

“The limits to the great power of heaven and earth are really unimaginable, even if we scramble our brains,” the five of them mused ruefully.

More and more people were appearing. Not one person approached. They were all watching from a distance. Who would dare stand in the way of the great power of heaven and earth?

But all of them knew that this great beast was close to the end of its line, and its flesh and blood would be of great use.

And this great beast was also close to the brink of crumbling, one of its wings having been forcibly ripped off, its tail severed by a fiery blade, and even eerily white bone could be seen from various spots of its body. Its aura was rising and falling unsteadily. This was a sign of impending death.

Everyone was keen and restless. Once this great beast was killed by the heavenly tribulation, a fierce competition would break out among them.

Consumption of the meat of this great beast might allow one to obtain the amazing techniques of Source Power of this heaven and earth, and just how valuable would be the Celestial medicine that had been nurtured by this great beast?

“Second Brother, you go and snatch the corpse of that great beast later. I will take a look underground,” Ling Han said.

The corpse of the great beast was indeed precious, but Ling Han was more curious about the location that was capable of nurturing such a great beast. Perhaps an even more shocking secret lay there. Of course, it was also possible that there was absolutely nothing there.

“All right!” The Rain Emperor nodded, confident and domineering.

Ling Han looked towards Hu Niu and the Empress. “The two of you help out Second Brother.”

“En.” The two women nodded. If it was merely exploring, one person would be enough, but the competition on the surface would need manpower.

“What about me?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked very energetically. She had no wish to be a mere spectator.

“You?” Ling Han stared at her.

Bewitching Maiden Rou’s expression was filled with anticipation. She did not mind how difficult the mission that Ling Han delegated to her would be. On the contrary, that would mean that Ling Han had a high opinion of her.

Ling Han pondered for a while, and then finally said, “As for you? Whatever you like.”

‘F*ck!’

Bewitching Maiden Rou puffed up in fury. For better or worse, she was also a First Secret emperor tier, and would be put in an important position in any great force. After all, even in great Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier sects, there would only be less than 10 emperor tiers.

Ling Han ignored her, and merely stared at the skies in concentration.

Boom, a frightening wave of flames surged past, and the great beast was suddenly cut in half. It released a wave of defiance through its divine sense, yet its form was rapidly falling from the skies, and its aura was immediately beginning to disperse.
