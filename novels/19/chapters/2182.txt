Chapter 2183: Leaping the Dragon’s Gate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After Ling Jianxue and his wife got married, they left the Heavenly Saint Palace, firstly to enjoy their married life, secondly for training, and thirdly also because they would keep being harrassed if they stayed in the sect.

…Even if Ling Jianxue had already married, there were still a great many female disciples willing to pounce on him. He was a man, after all, so wouldn’t it be very normal that he would have a good number of lovers?

And Chen Shuangshuang was unable to chase away all the pestering bugs, either, as there would be people expressing goodwill to her. Hence, the young couple decided to just leave. What they did not see, their hearts would not grieve over. After several hundred to over 1,000 years, all this would naturally be appeased.

Ling Han, too, prepared to leave. He had already cultivated the Heaven Deceiving Technique to Small Accomplishment Level, and was sure that he would be able to attain Great Accomplishment not much later, but to reach Consummate level, he would still have to spend a boundless amount of time.

Several days later, Ling Han received a piece of news.

“Dragon’s Gate Mountain? Leaping over the Dragon’s Gate?” This was the newest information that the scouts of the Heavenly Saint Palace had obtained.

Rich and powerful great sects like the Heavenly Saint Palace naturally had innumerable feelers which they extended to all corners of the Celestial Realm. Their main purpose was to monitor if there were any changes in authority in the many great forces and important matters of the like.

Additionally, the appearance and opening of ancient sites was also within their range of monitoring. After all, some ancient sites were extremely important, and could even alter the destiny of a great sect.

“Who knows what the hell this Dragon’s Gate Mountain is?” Ling Han flipped through the information, and became increasingly surprised as he continued reading, also revealing an expression of pleasant surprise.

“What Dragon’s Gate Mountain?” Hu Niu asked curiously.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “This is really a place where the carp leaps the dragon’s gate. According to the information, this Dragon’s Gate Mountain is not located in the Celestial Realm, but rather floats in the void. It will only appear once every epoch, and if one is able to reach the summit, and leap over the Dragon’s Gate, it would result in a complete transformation.”

“Transforming into a dragon?” Hu Niu continued to ask.

“The dragon is the most powerful Immortal Beast, and turning into a dragon is only a way of putting it, not that you would really transform into an Immortal Dragon,” Ling Han replied with a smile. “The climbing of Dragon’s Gate Mountain only depends on willpower, and not on natural talent.

“If your willpower is not strong enough, no matter how prodigious you are, even a monarch tier could not possibly complete the climb. And if you have an iron willpower, you could still undergo a complete transformation even if you are an idiot, and become a dragon in a single stroke, opening the doors to a supreme path of cultivation.

“Most importantly, it can allow one to deliver a severance to the heaven and earth!” Ling Han exclaimed excitedly.

Helian Xunxue and the other women were all stuck at peak stage Genesis Tier, and hesitated, not daring to take a single step further. Even if they were to sever the mundane, their greatest obsession would definitely be the love they felt towards Ling Han.

However, their aptitude was not adequate, and they could not strike a severance to the heaven and earth to take their step into the realm of celestials. Thus, before their lifespan dried up, or they reached the point where the Immortal’s Tribulation became too serious, they would definitely not make the move to advance to the Severing Mundane Tier.

However, as long as they could leap over the Dragon’s Gate, they could greatly transform themselves, and improve their aptitude of cultivation. Delivering a strike to the heaven and earth to enter into the realm of celestials naturally would become possible, and the chances were extremely high at that.

More importantly, the requirement for climbing the Dragon’s Gate Mountain and leaping over the Dragon’s Gate was not aptitude, natural talent, strength, or cultivation level, but merely pure determination. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“We will definitely succeed!” The women were all confident, and were also incredibly determined.

They had fallen too far behind Ling Han, and had to grab hold of this chance.

“Strange.” Ling Han suddenly faltered. “According to the information, the Dragon’s Gate Mountain would only appear once every epoch, and is a genuine heaven-defying great opportunity that would alter your destiny, but from the last time it appeared until now, it has only been nine trillion years.”

One epoch was 12 trillion years.

“Even if there is deviation, it should not go so far as deviation for three trillion years.” The Empress nodded as well. Just how long was three trillion years? If there was a deviation of tens of millions of years, or even 100,000,000 years, that would still be acceptable. After all, the basic figure was too large.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s mind, and he said, “Unless this is a consciousness of the heaven and earth wanting to nurture more prodigies to stand against the invasion of the force of darkness?”

“En!” Everyone nodded.

The Heavenly Dao channeled with its own logic. For example, when a cultivator broke through, a heavenly tribulation would descend, and that was the heaven and earth working on maintaining a balance, not allowing someone who was too strong to appear, disturbing the channeling of the Heavenly Dao.

And now, the heaven and earth felt a great threat to its existence, so the heaven and earth would appropriately make some changes, such as allowing the Dragon’s Gate Mountain to appear ahead of time, and that was the heaven and earth moving as a self-protective measure.

“However, even the heaven and earth is compelled to make such drastic changes. It can be imagined just what kind of great threat it has sensed this time round? The pressure is so great that it did not hesitate to make a great change to the channeling of Heavenly Dao.” Ling Han looked worried.

“Perhaps, the next time the force of darkness fully invades… it will be considerably sooner than we have predicted.”

The Empress nodded. “What we need the most now is time.”

Even with the 100,000x time acceleration effects of the Black Tower, it was not enough. The more their cultivation levels progressed, the slower their advancement would become, especially after they advanced into Celestial King Tier. Using a whole epoch to advance to the next Heaven was nothing rare.

Even if the force of darkness would only invade fully after another 1,000,000 years, that would only be a trillion years for Ling Han, less than one-tenth of a whole epoch.

Perhaps Ling Han could have become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King by then, but a Heavenly Venerate?

It’d be difficult!

“Since even the heaven and earth has been compelled to make changes, the leap over the Dragon’s Gate this time would definitely have great benefits. We have to take hold of this opportunity.” Ling Han immediately came to a decision.

To give the women the ability of delivering a strike to the heaven and earth to advance into the realm of celestials, Ling Han had to take this detour, what more when it would also be greatly beneficial for himself, the Empress, Hu Niu, and the others.

“There’s not much time, or I would want to make a trip back to the Eastern Celestial Realm, and bring everyone else with me,” Ling Han said.

The “everyone else” he was speaking of was naturally referring to the “veterans” that he had brought with him from the small world, such as his cousin, the peerlessly talented maniac, Gu Fenghua, the White-Robed Sword King, Shen Zhong Chen, and so on.

The Dragon’s Gate Mountain would not be there forever. The time it stayed every time was indefinite, but it would not be too long before it would rip a hole into the void, and leave once more.

“Who knows where Jianxue and Shuangshuang have gone off to. Hopefully, they would have gotten the news as well.”

After the decision was made, they immediately set out.

It was not just them, but the entire Celestial Realm that had erupted in a commotion. Without caring if they could make it in time, countless people rushed towards the Dragon’s Gate Mountain. Even Celestial Kings were not exempted. This was truly a natural Mystery Realm, a test from the heaven and earth, and a blessing from the heaven and earth.

Even if they were elites, they could still get rid of the impurities in their bodies after leaping over the Dragon’s Gate, and improve in all aspects, advancing in the direction of Heavenly Dao.

It was probably only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings that would have completely no use for this.

The heaven and earth would definitely not allow anyone to rise above Regulations, so Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could not possibly be allowed to advance one step further, and cross over into Heavenly Venerable Tier. Of course, for a Heavenly Venerate, this definitely was also a meaningless matter.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Weng, weng, weng.?Multiple figures shot out of Heavenly Saint Palace, and the Transference Portal of Red Blossom Village was also endlessly flickering with light. It was practically channeling without stopping, delivering wave after wave of people.

Though it wasn’t able to cross the boundaries of Heavenly Realms, it could still save a great amount of journeying time, and allow people to arrive at the boundaries of Roc Heaven.

Ling Han and his group also arrived at Red Blossom Village. To increase their pace, only Hu Niu and the Empress were by his side, while the others remained inside the Black Tower.

“Humph, humph!” When they arrived at the Transfer Formation, they saw Ye Jiande look menacingly at them. Then, with a flash of light, he had already disappeared from sight.

Saying that comes from a Chinese folklore legend referring to how a carp can eventually become a dragon by leaping over the Dragon’s Gate — also means getting one’s big break..
