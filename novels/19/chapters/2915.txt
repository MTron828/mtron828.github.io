2916 Chapter 2918 – Bai Mifan

Ling Han had a solemn expression. This person was undoubtedly a prodigy, and wasn’t any weaker than Lin Youlian and the rest. However, he wasn’t famous.

Sigh. Was it because his name was Bai Mifan that he had managed to stay so low-key?

The introduction sure didn’t make for a strong first impression. A person capable of defeating multiple elites, and he went by the name Bai Mifan. It was pretty funny to think about.

Bai Mifan rushed over with both palms striking out. The earth rumbled and huge gusts of wind billowed under the terrifying force.

!!

Fortunately, this was the intersection between both realms, with the Void taking up a huge section of the space. As such, there was no need to be concerned about the level of destruction. Otherwise, even a medium-level dimension would be destroyed by the force of two Fifth Tiers clashing.

The two exchanged blows to test the waters.

“Brother Ling is truly no ordinary man to be able to harness the strength of a Fifth Tier at just Third Tier. I am thoroughly impressed,” Bai Mifan gave his heartfelt praise.

Even though he wasn’t famous, he was extremely proud, and didn’t even consider prodigies like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu on the same level as him. He was sure he wouldn’t lose against any of them. However, when fighting against Ling Han, he couldn’t contain his admiration.

Ling Han was definitely the first person ever to be able to fight on an equal level with him despite his strength being lower by one whole tier.

“You’re pretty good too.” Ling Han nodded. There definitely weren’t a lot of people who could stand shoulder to shoulder with this Bai Mifan.

Bai Mifan lightly chuckled. “However, one’s base strength is only but a tiny aspect of their battle prowess, and is not the determining factor of a fight.”

“Show me what other powerful moves you have then.” Ling Han was excited to see what other techniques Bai Mifan was going to display.

As Bai Mifan clenched his right hand, another seal lit up. He launched another attack, but this time his strength increased by at least 30 times from his previous attacks.

Using a sixth-grade seal from the get-go?

What a rich guy.

Ling Han was curious whether that Heavenly Venerable Seal was created by Bai Mifan himself, or he was given it by an elder.

He also activated his own sixth-grade seal and clashed with Bai Mifan.

The two of them were both around late-stage Fifth Tier in strength, and the boost they received from their Heavenly Venerable Seals was also more or less similar in capacity. As such, they were pretty evenly matched. However, the destructive force behind their clashes was tremendous, so much so that even the Empress and the rest couldn’t find any room to step in.

After a few short clashes, Bai Mifan finally started using his true strength. He activated a sword technique. There was nothing his sword couldn’t sever with its cold light. It was truly terrifying.

Ling Han also took out his Divine Demon Sword, and met Bai Mifan head-on. Neither side was giving an inch.

Ling Han was not anxious at all. Given that Ling Han was one tier lower, Bai Mifan was the one who would surely be anxious if they came to a draw.

As expected, Bai Mifan started to increase the tenacity of his attacks, activating his other Heavenly Venerable Seals, and increasing his own battle prowess.

40, 50, 60 times… Bai Mifan had an astonishing number of Heavenly Venerable Seals, and each one got rarer than the last. Ling Han couldn’t help but be curious about his background when he saw how many resources he had.

However, Ling Han didn’t pale in comparison, either. He activated several high-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals, and managed to keep up with Bai Mifan’s increase in strength.

Eventually, Bai Mifan activated another seal. Suddenly, he gave off an oppressive aura, as though he had become an unbeatable god.

A first-grade seal!

Ling Han was shocked as he thought, ‘Damn, how can this be? Someone else actually came into possession of a first-grade seal?’

Boom!

Bai Mifan slashed with his sword, the terrifying force behind it capable of slashing the world in half.

This was the result of using a first-grade seal to supplement one’s strength. It was truly horrifying.

However, Ling Han was not afraid. He also had a first-grade seal, as well as two complete sets of combination seals. If he used that, then it would actually be horrific.

Boom, boom, boom. The clash between them caused the earth to shake, which naturally drew the attention of many people. When they realized that the person Ling Han was facing was a never-before-seen youngster, they were all surprised.

“Who is that guy?”

“A Fourth Tier with a Fifth Tier’s battle prowess. He isn’t any weaker than those three.”

“But how did someone like that just pop out of nowhere?”

“He even has a first-grade seal. Dear God, could he be the successor of some Seventh Tier Venerate?”

Everyone was curious, but no matter how much they asked, no one knew of Bai Mifan’s true identity.

Ling Han felt a thump in his chest as he thought, ‘Don’t tell me this guy is one of Hysteria’s moles like Meng Dong?’

There were about 100 people in the Flaming Frost Realm who had already risen to Heavenly Venerate status, and each of them should have mastered a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

It was too presumptuous to think that Bai Mifan was an agent of Hysteria just based on that.

Not to mention, while Meng Dong and his gang had the ability to fight against people of a higher tier, they were nowhere near the extent of this Bai Mifan. The latter’s strength was definitely enough to group him with the likes of Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu.

As Ling Han pondered such thoughts, his hands didn’t slack in the slightest. On the contrary, he got even more aggressive.

“Good, how fun!” Bai Mifan excitedly said. “Take another move from me!”

He was completely lost in the excitement of battle, no longer addressing Ling Han as Brother Ling, nor using a polite tone when speaking. As he shouted in fervor, his right eye suddenly emitted a light, creating an illusion which quickly transformed into a single world.

While the world was small, like a sparrow, it had everything needed for survival—mountains, rivers, seas, and lakes. The world was an empty land without any signs of life.

Ling Han frowned slightly as he felt the terrifying pressure. This world seemed all too real to him.

“Go!” Bai Mifan commanded, and the world descended towards Ling Han.

Boom! It was as though an entire world was pressing down on him.

Ling Han soon realized. “This is the dimension that you’ve fused into your body!”

“Indeed!” Bai Mifan wasn’t shy about admitting it, and nodded in acknowledgement. “However, I have yet to refine it to the Great Accomplishment level. As such, I am only able to harness 10% of its strength.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was too terrifying. Using an entire world to suppress your opponent was definitely taken in the literal sense here.

‘So there is such a use for the small world inside your body?’

Even if it only had 10% of the strength, it was still too shocking. Ling Han felt an immense desire to avoid this attack at all costs, or he would be crushed to a pulp.

However, this was still a sparring session. Wouldn’t he be admitting defeat if he didn’t take this move head-on?

...

He cast away his sword. Boom! Utilizing all his ninth-grade seals, Ling Han increased his battle prowess to the maximum output, and punched out furiously.

…If he wanted to be even stronger, he would have to use his eighth-grade combination seals. However, this was his trump in the sleeve right now.

Boom!

As the world descended, Ling Han punched back relentlessly. Bang, bang, bang! With each fist, the world would crack slightly, and by the time it was just on top of Ling Han’s head, it was full of tiny fissures.

Bang! As Ling Han punched back one last time, the world finally crumbled. An enormous amount of energy sprayed forth, causing tremors throughout the entire base.

What a terrifying attack.

Ling Han was also a little exhausted. He had only launched a few thousand punches, but he was already feeling the fatigue from it all. It was evident the amount of pressure he had been under.

The onlookers around them were also astonished. No one expected the Fourth Tier that had suddenly come out of nowhere to be this vicious.

Who the hell was this guy?
