Chapter 2019: Firm Essence Green Gold

As Ling Han’s thoughts whirled, he arrived on the western coast of the island.

The moment he arrived, he was immediately stunned by the scene that met his eyes—this was too grandiose. Marine creatures that numbered in the tens of thousands were presently surging towards the island. Some were already closely approaching, and were presently launching a fierce offensive.

For example, a walrus that was 3,000 meters tall was presently using its gigantic body to crash into the island. Only a single collision, and the whole island would tremble, as if it was about to be fragmented by the crash.

Or another example: a massive lobster was using its twin pincers to send out slashes onto the coast. Multiple seals of Dao covered its pinchers, shining brilliantly.

However, the island had also long since set up the first line of defense, stopping these marine creatures from invading further. Furthermore, though there were a great many marine creatures, and they were very big, their quality was quite unevenly spread out, and only a few rare ones were really strong.

Thus, strictly speaking, they had only come to deliver themselves to death.

A resident of the island sent out a punch, and a black-colored flame blazed. One punch was capable of insta-killing 10 marine creatures. Another waved a sword in a slash, and again black-colored Sword Qi filled the skies. Blood spurted in all directions, and masses of marine creatures collapsed.

There were also powerful marine creatures among the tide, like a golden yellow frog. As it opened its mouth, it would send out golden light that turned into golden arrows. Xiu, xiu, xiu, wherever it landed, it would immediately cause a great many island residents to suffer severe injury.

“Let me!” A loud shout rang out, and Lan Tianyu charged out, blocking this giant frog, and they both began an intense battle.

And there were fierce battles taking place everywhere on this western coast.

There was a very large gap in strength among the marine creatures, but there was no shortage of elites among them. There was an Immortal Palace Tier clam that created a terrifying hurricane capable of destroying everything as it opened and closed its shell. There was also a six-legged green crocodile that spat out seals capable of shaking the heavens and shattering the ground from its mouth.

Intense battles were happening everywhere. No one could slack off, and what was more frightening was that there were endless marine creatures that were presently surging over from the depths of the seas.

It was just like... the people on this island had killed their king, or their prince, and they were now here to get revenge at all costs.

Merely a day had passed, and the coast of the island was already covered with corpses. Blood had dyed the waters of the surrounding area red. However, those that had died were basically all the marine creatures, and the casualties on the side of the humans were still zero.

But, those like Qin Wei and the others were already running out of Origin Power. Furthermore, they were continuously drawing on the power of Regulation. Their spirits were also weary and battered, and their battle prowess could possibly drop from the peak to rock bottom at any moment.

The exertion in the battle was too harsh. Otherwise, with the accumulation of Origin Power that a Celestial had, they could at least continue fighting for more than half a year’s time.

Just think of how they had previously encountered the giant tsunami, and one would know. It had only been several hundred waves, and the formations had sucked all of them dry, causing them to collapse in fatigue.

On the other hand, those on the ancient castle’s side were all still looking very energetic, and there was completely no display of weariness.

This was the amazing trait of the other system of cultivation, or was it a benefit of believing in that “deity”?

“Yi, power of sacrifice!” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

“Sacrifice?” Ling Han frowned. He had naturally heard of the matter of sacrifice.

For example, if some place was too violent and inauspicious, then a sacrifice could possibly remove the inauspiciousness. In the Ancient Realm, the Eternity Sky Emperor had also organized a large-scale sacrifice for the sake of obtaining the Nine Demons Sword so that the murderous aura of the Nine Demons Sword could be removed.

This place was also preparing a sacrifice?

While what was being sacrificed was naturally these marine creatures, what was the sacrifice meant for?

Small Tower did not speak further. Instead, it channeled the Black Tower. Instantly, a majestic power surged up, actually causing all the marine creatures to tremble, and cease their attacks at the same time.

In the boundless sea, practically all the living creatures had not gained intelligence, and they were all in the primal state.

But the more primitive they were, the more sensitive these marine creatures were to powerful beings. For them, the Black Tower was a supreme existence.

However, it was only a mere instant, and when the power of the Black Tower surged over, the marine creatures regained their ferocity, and began to launch a fierce offensive once more.

“...Brat, while you are a bringer of calamity, your luck seems to be extraordinarily good!” Small Tower spoke again. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Are you praising me, commending me, or complimenting me?” Ling Han asked with a grin.

“Your skin is really quite thick.”

“Hehe.”

Small Tower paused, and continued, “There is a Source Power of heaven and earth beneath this island.”

“What!?” Ling Han got a shock. “Really?”

He naturally would not suspect Small Tower. While this guy was a tsundere, there seemed to have never been any previous instance in which it had been joking, and would never use this kind of matter to deceive him.

“What type is it?” he asked quickly.

“Metal Element,” Small Tower said. “Firm Essence Green Gold.”

Metal Element!

Ling Han’s heart involuntarily jolted. He already had three Source Powers of heaven and earth, and they were Water, Fire, and Wood, and now, if he could gain another Metal Element Source Power of heaven and earth, he would be one step closer to having nine Source Powers of heaven and earth to complete his Dividing Soul Tier.

“Hold on, you were speaking about sacrifice just now. Could it be that sacrifice is for the sake of retrieving the Firm Essence Green Gold?”

“The nature of Metal Element is violent and murderous, so to retrieve this Source Power of heaven and earth, you would have to first remove the air of violence of the Firm Essence Green Gold. Otherwise, this would be equivalent to having a Celestial King blast his aura madly. Not even Ascending Origin Tier could stand against that.

“Moreover, the people on the seas have never heard of beast tides, but it has suddenly broken out here.”

‘This means...

‘This beast tide is possibly artificially engineered for the purpose of obtaining enough materials for sacrifice.

‘Though it has not been proven yet, if there really was a Source Power of heaven and earth here, and a Metal Element one at that, then there is a 99% chance that this deduction is not wrong.’

Ling Han stopped his thoughts from wandering, and asked Small Tower, “Then has this Source Power of heaven and earth reached a time it can be retrieved?”

“Almost,” Small Tower said. “This kind of sacrifice would have to continue for at least over a million years. Only then would the sharp air of violence drop to rock bottom. It could possibly be this time, it could also possibly need another two to three times, and only then could it be retrieved.

“However, success would still have to depend on fortune.”

Removing the air of violence was only the first step, winning one the opportunity to show his face in front of the Source Power of heaven and earth, but it did not represent completely that it could be retrieved by then. However, without the opportunity to show one’s face, there was even less possibility of retrieving it.

‘Lan Ruozhi said that they had only been on this island for several million years. Then, it is highly possible that they were the first to discover that this place houses the Firm Essence Green Gold, and that was why they settled down here.

‘And then, through a great many years of study, they came up with this method of sacrifice.

‘Though I still have not met that Island Master, but judging from his actions, he should be a smart man who plans before he moves. Furthermore, this alternate system of cultivation may have some other strange factor to it that could allow him to retrieve the Source Power of heaven and earth.

‘I had already planned to cause a great disturbance. If I could ruin the plans of that Island Master for retrieving the Firm Essence Green Gold, or even if I myself could retrieve it, that would not be too bad.’

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. He could not possibly stop this sacrificial rite. Though Dividing Soul Tier monarch tiers were indeed very strong, against an Immortal Palace Tier, there was still no way he could match the opponent, what more when there were also Ascending Origin Tier elites on the other side too. Even if he took out the poisonous fruit of the Red Spotted Green Bamboo, he would still be unable to succeed.

Then, why not just add fuel to the fire, and he himself could retrieve this Source Power of heaven and earth.

That was what he had decided on doing.

Ling Han roared, and was just planning to push his battle prowess to full throttle when he saw a man suddenly leap over, and directly send a sword slash in his direction.

“Die!”
