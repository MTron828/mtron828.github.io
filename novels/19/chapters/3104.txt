3105 Monkey

A baboon was asking for food from him?

Ling Han was slightly surprised. This was not the Genesis World, where it would not be strange no matter how human-like and intelligent beasts were because even wild animals had become intelligent. This was a world that had just begun on its path of evolution. The appearance of such an intelligent animal would definitely be shocking.

Seeing that Ling Han didn’t respond, the baboon turned around, showing its red butt as it swayed back and forth, as if it was provoking him.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He used his sword to cut off a piece of meat from the wolf’s leg, and then tossed it over.

The baboon hurriedly caught it. Its body was extremely agile, but this piece of meat had just been cooked through, and was extremely hot. As soon as it grabbed it, it immediately let out a strange cry. However, it was clearly a glutton and refused to let go. It kept juggling it from its left hand to its right hand, then from its right hand to its left hand.

After tossing the meat back and forth dozens of times, the heat of the meat slowly subsided. Only then did the baboon grab the meat and eat it. With a bite, oil seeped out. The meat was incomparably fat and delicious.

“Howl! Howl! Howl!” The monkey was so happy that it kept jumping and eating even faster.

Ling Han also began eating. He was indeed hungry. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The baboon quickly finished the meat, and then extended its hand toward Ling Han. Its eyes were wide open, and it looked a little adorable, as if it was begging for more food.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. Previously, he had just seen how it had been speculated that humans had evolved from apes. Then, was this his brother from the primitive ages?

“Take it.” He threw out another piece of meat.

The baboon jumped up in excitement again, and lowered its head, beginning to eat again.

Its appetite was truly not small. Only after eating four pieces of meat did it finally stop asking Ling Han for more.

Xiu, it leaped up and climbed onto a tree. The leaves rustled, and it quickly disappeared from sight.

Sigh, it had really forgotten Ling Han’s kindness. It ran away after eating?

‘You didn’t even stay long enough to wipe your mouth.’

It was better not to have such a brother from the primitive ages.

Strange, didn’t he also obtain a powerful affinity? Why didn’t it work on this monkey?

Ling Han laughed in his heart. He naturally wouldn’t take a monkey to heart. Seeing that the sky was also very dark by now, he decided to find a cave to stay in for the night.

Right now, his strength was only equivalent to an ordinary peak stage of Two Meridians. That could not be considered strong at all. Therefore, he naturally could not be careless.

His luck was not bad, and he quickly found a cave. Furthermore, it was very dry inside. He started a fire, and simply sealed the entrance of the cave with rocks before closing his eyes to rest.

The sword was placed right at his side. If any wild beasts wanted to attack at night, he would kill them immediately.

The night passed peacefully.

One thing had already become instinctive for Ling Han—he woke up before the sun had even risen. He pushed aside the stone at the entrance, found a flat ground, and began to practice his fist techniques.

Entering the deep mountains to train was one thing, but he also wanted to try his luck and see if he could find some precious fruits.

After the great changes of heaven and earth, many new plants had appeared, such as the Meridian Guiding Fruit Tree. In addition, many other plants would bear precious fruits which were greatly beneficial to cultivators.

These plants were called Precious Trees and Precious Herbs, and the fruits they produced were called Precious Fruits. Of course, there were also people who called them Mysterious Fruits, Treasured Fruits, and even Celestial Fruits.

There was a Meridian Guiding Fruit Tree in the Ancient Dao Sect, and it was currently the most precious treasured tree. However, who knew if there was a second treasure tree in this vast mountain?

‘Eh?’

Ling Han was practicing his martial arts when his ears suddenly twitched. He heard rustling sounds, and then saw large monkeys jump down from a tree and sit down in front of him one after another.

There were at least 30 of them surrounding him.

There were tall and sturdy male baboons, as well as female monkeys carrying their cubs. They surrounded Ling Han forcefully, and some were even imitating Ling Han’s fist technique. Their out-of-place appearance really made one want to laugh.

Ling Han ignored them. The time he had to cultivate every day was limited, and he only treated these monkeys as if they did not exist. He only stopped after the limited time of half an hour of cultivation had ended.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak!” These monkeys all jumped up now, as if they knew that Ling Han could not be disturbed just now.

“Don’t tell me you’re all here to eat?” Ling Han couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat. After that monkey had eaten the wolf meat yesterday, could it be that it had gone back to “advertise,” and had only brought so many companions over today?

In his eyes, every monkey looked the same. It was really difficult to tell which monkey was the one from yesterday.

“Alright, I am going to eat breakfast anyway,” Ling Han said with a smile.

On the basis that they were all his “primitive age family,” he would treat them to a meal.

He began to roast the meat, and the monkeys continued to watch. A monkey was impatient by nature. When they smelled the fragrance of the meat, they began to jump up and down, and they could not help but drool.

“Take it.” Ling Han divided the wolf meat into many portions, and after taking a portion himself, he gave the rest of the meat to the monkeys.

The monkeys immediately swarmed forward, and divided the roasted meat among themselves.

After eating, the monkeys dispersed.

“Sigh, as expected, they’re a bunch of ingrates.” Ling Han shook his head. He rested for a while, then slung his sword onto his back, and prepared to set off.

Shua, shua, shua. The leaves rustled, and a few more baboons appeared. However, they weren’t empty-handed this time. Instead, they each held two fruits in their hands.

A total of seven monkeys placed 14 fruits in front of Ling Han.

“Yi, is this for me?” Ling Han was surprised. Could it be that he was wrong? These monkeys also knew how to repay kindness.

“Squeak, squeak.” The seven monkeys all jumped up and down, as if responding to Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and picked up the fruits. He didn’t even need to put them close to the tip of his nose, and he could already smell a refreshing fragrance coming from them.

He washed them cleanly, and picked one to eat first.

As soon as he took a bite, a sweet juice exploded in his mouth, making all the pores on his body seem to open up. There was only one word to describe it: comfortable.

Not only that, but he also felt a trace of energy surging in his meridians, which had the effect of expanding them. However, this speed was ridiculously slow, and could not be compared to when he was practicing his fist technique.

It could increase one’s cultivation?

Ling Han was astonished. No matter how weak it was, it still didn’t require him to cultivate it himself. This boost to cultivation was completely obtained for free. Who would reject it?

Precious Fruit. This was also a Precious Fruit.

Ling Han wolfed down the fruit. After finishing one fruit, he began to eat the other fruits.

These fruits were all of the same type. They were the size of a fist, and were completely red in color.

This fruit was really valuable. Not only was it delicious, but it could also increase one’s cultivation.

Even though Ling Han had already eaten his fill earlier, he still forced himself to finish all these fruits.

When he consumed all 14 fruits, he discovered it was equivalent to having cultivated for another day.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation, and asked a large monkey, “Are there any more fruits like this?”

How could the baboons understand his words? They all squeaked as if they were looking at an idiot.

F*ck, was he being looked down upon by a few monkeys?

Ling Han pointed at the fruit cores on the ground, and then made a gesture of eating, gesturing like this so the monkeys could see what he meant.

Since they were his primitive age brothers, they should be able to understand him, right?
