Chapter 3576: Probing

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

For the moment, there was no possibility of any further improvement. Ling Han walked out of his room, and saw Niu Jianhua and another young man were presently gathered around a young beauty.

That woman was dressed in a lake-green long skirt, graceful and shapely, her looks captivating. Her skin was like milk, fair and smooth. It could indeed be said that she was quite outstanding. No wonder she could make Niu Jianhua and the other man gather around her.

Ling Han took a glance before withdrawing his gaze, and when Niu Jianhua discovered that he had come out, he immediately said to the woman as if presenting a treasure, “Lady Xiao, this is the Grandmaster of Divination that I have spoken of. He is incredibly accurate!”

The swelling on his head had just subsided today, and the bad luck that had been entwined around him had also disappeared without a trace. For the whole morning, he did not choke on any water he had drunk, or farted in public, which convinced him that his bad luck had really left him.

Thus, he naturally had complete trust in Ling Han’s identity as a Divination Grandmaster.

Impressive.

Che!” The other young man, Sun Xun, immediately shook his head, “A brat that is still wet behind the ears, how could he possibly be a Grandmaster of Divmation? At least, he would have to be a Core Formation Tier or even True Self Tier elite to be qualified to predict destiny, what more to speak of changing destiny.”

He definitely didn’t believe Ling Han.

How could Niu Jianhua be willing to lose face in front of a beauty? He hurriedly said, “If you don’t understand, then don’t speak nonsense. This is definitely a Grandmaster of Divination!”

“Ha, from your tone, you probably don’t even know his name, right?” Sun Xun laughed loudly.

Niu Jianhua was instantly rendered speechless. At first, he did not even bother to find out Ling Han’s name, but afterwards, he kept calling him Grandmaster, and forgot to ask Ling Han’s name.

Xiao Zhixuan’s interest was piqued, and she asked Ling Han, “Dare I ask how I should address this Grandmaster?”

Ling Han put on an air of mystery, swept an eye over Xiao Zhixuan, then said, “My name is Can Ye.”

This name really seemed to exude a mysterious aura.

Xiao Zhixuan exclaimed, “Really? Why have you been given such a name? Don’t you have a surname? It can’t be that your surname is Can, right?”

She was a little like a curious child.

Ling Han was speechless. Your question should be directed to Can Ye, what does it have to do with him?

“Grandmaster Can Ye, why don’t you also read my fortune?” Xiao Zhixuan said delicately.

Ling Han turned around and left, “To ask this Grandmaster for help, how could it be something that you can achieve with just a casual word?”

After saying this, he had already disappeared at the door, putting on an extremely pretentious act.

At first, Niu Jianhua wanted to stop him, but his thoughts were on Xiao Zhixuan, so he couldn’t be bothered to care. After all, all his bad luck had disappeared, proving that Ling Han was really a Grandmaster, and he did not dare to offend him carelessly either.

It was said that aside from removing bad luck, these Grandmasters could also bring bad luck to others. He had no wish to begin that kind of unfortunate life again when he had just returned to normal.

“Interesting,” Xiao Zhixuan murmured as she looked at the door. She then stretched, showing off her beautiful curves. This also caused Niu Jianhua and Sun Xun to stare with wide eyes. “I’m going back to take an afternoon nap. Only when your skin is healthy and you’re in a good mood will you feel better.” Ling Han walked around the Primordial Sect. He had already changed his appearance, so he was naturally unafraid that others would recognize his true identity.

However, the area of activity for competitors like them had been restricted. The moment they walked out, the disciples of the Primordial Sect would stop them.

Though Ling Han could smack this kind of opponent to death with a single hand, he wasn’t here to make a big fuss, was he?

He wormed his way into being friends with these disciples. Some were very tight-lipped, while others had the habit of boasting. With a few words from him, they would spit out all that they knew.

This Primordial Sect was very powerful.

The Primordial True Lord already had a group of followers in the prison;, and there was no shortage of elites of the True Self Tier and Core Formation Tier. Now that they had escaped, these people also held important positions in the Primordial Sect.

Under the sect master, there were four elders, all of whom were True Self Tier elites, and under the elders, there were nine protectors, all of whom were in the Core Formation Tier. Below this cultivation level, those in the Cauldron Forging Tier and Foundation Building Tier could only become members of the high level sect members, without any real power.

Of course, in the Primordial Sect, the majority were still ordinary disciples below Celestial Path.

The Primordial True Lord had a total of three personal disciples. The eldest disciple was called Deng Qi, and he had already entered into the Cauldron Forging Tier. The second disciple was called Han Gang, and he had just reached the Foundation Building Tier. The third disciple was called Liu Jun, and his cultivation level was the lowest. He was a Mystery Realm Tier.

Originally, there was still a fourth disciple, Xin Ruyue, who had been killed by Ling Han.

Liu Jun would also be participating in the martial arts competition this time round. It was said that his battle prowess was terrifying, and it was very possible that he was a two-star genius.

Ling Han frowned. A two-star genius in Mystery Realm Tier… this was a bit of a problem.

If he were up against a one-star genius in Mystery Realm Tier, Ling Han would still have absolute confidence in winning. However, if he were up against a two-star genius… If there was still a mortal cultivation level above the Mystery Realm Tier, then the battle prowess of a two-star genius would leap to the next cultivation level.

Ling Han now had to conceal his identity, and there were a great many techniques that he could not use. Fighting this kind of opponent would be too difficult.

“However, I’ve been tempered by the Ancestral King True Blood, and I’ve also seen many scenes of Ancestral King Pan Shi battling when he was young. My horizons have greatly increased, and if I use my eye technique, I might be able to see through the weaknesses of my opponents and obtain victory.” Ling Han was not blindly confident. This Liu Jun was superior to him by a major tier in cultivation level, and was a true prodigy at that. He definitely could not be careless.

He returned to the courtyard, and discovered that Niu Jianhua was presently arguing about something with Sun Xun, his face flushed red and his neck stiff. Sigh, that Xiao Zhixuan clearly had not taken a fancy to either of them, so what are the two of you arguing about?

Ling Han returned to his room. The martial arts tournament would begin tomorrow, and he could still cultivate one more time. It would be good if he could improve a little.

If there were still Ice Origin Stones, Ling Han was sure that cultivating one more time would be enough for him to open another aperture, but now, it would at least take five to six days.

At night, the Primordial Sect also sent a notice through a disciple, introducing how the competition would be held tomorrow.

Because there were too many participants, if all of them were to fight in one-on-one battles, it was possible that they would be able to compete for a month’s time, or even longer. Thus, a large-scale elimination tournament would be held tomorrow, and the thirty-two strongest seeds would be directly decided.

Once one made it into the top 32, they would be able to choose whether to join the Primordial Sect or not. If they could make it into the top 16, they would be able to choose to become the disciple of a protector. If they could make it into the top eight, the elders would also move out to recruit disciples.

If one made it into the top four, he would have the chance to become a disciple of the Primordial True Lord, and become a true disciple.

The knockout tournament was very simple. Everyone would be placed on the same mountain to begin a battle royale. It would only take one day, and when there were only thirty-two left, the knockout tournament would be over, and if there were still more than thirty-two people standing after one day, then it would be a battle to see who would come out first. The thirty-two people who came out first would be able to enter into the final rounds.

Niu Jianhua patted Ling Han’s shoulder, and said proudly, “Don’t worry. Since you’ve helped me get rid of my bad luck, I’ll bring you to the top thirty-two no matter what. You only have to follow me.”

Actually, these words were meant for Xiao Zhixuan to hear. The purpose was naturally to say, ‘Look, just how strong I am.’

Meanwhile, Sun Xun said coldly, “Hehe, I think you yourself can’t guarantee your own safety!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He confronted Niu Jianhua, pouring cold water on him..
