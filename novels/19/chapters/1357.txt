Chapter 1358 Why did you hit me?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Situ Lin screamed in pain. Though Zhao Ku was furious, he felt even more wronged. Why was he being so pummelled horribly for no reason like this?

“Young Master Ku, what exactly did I do wrong? Young Master Ku, have mercy! I only helped you find a beautiful woman; if you are not satisfied, we can find another one!”

“Find another your sister!” Zhao Ku’s eyes were about to breathe fire. He actually dared to still remind him of this?

He was even more furious!

If he could, he naturally wanted to fool around with this kind of exquisite beauty. But more importantly, Ling Han had a Genesis Tier-level background, and even his decree was not effective against him, so how could he afford to trifle with this kind of bringer of misfortune?

“You bastard, I want to pull out your tendons and remove your skin!” Zhao Ku continued to thrash him horribly.

He was a standard spoilt young master, so what would he actually fear? One punch from him, and Situ Lin’s arm was ripped off and his bone broken. It was a mere few punches, and Situ Lin was beyond recognition, not far off from death.

What was pitiful was that Situ Lin still had no idea why he was being beaten.

How innocent!

“Stop!” With a cold humph, a figure leaped down from the second floor. He was a tall, sturdy old man that looked to be in his sixties to seventies. However, his body was solid and well-built, his vitality extremely vigorous.

He was a powerful figure in the Situ Clan, Situ Jianyuan. Though he was not on the level of grand elders, all those who had advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier would be considered mighty figures. Furthermore, he was in the high extreme, and was capable of matching Zhao Ku.

A minor quarrel among the juniors would be fine, but now, it was obvious that death would result soon. Thus, no matter how powerful Zhao Ku’s background was, he could not possibly sit by and watch. Otherwise, if a member of the Situ Clan had been beaten to death in Gathering Wind City, how would they be able to face others in future?

“Old wretch, you dare boss me around?” Zhao Ku showed fully the attitude of a profligate young master. Facing forces that could not match his own clan, he would dare offend them to the extreme.

Situ Jianyuan almost exploded in fury. Ever since he had stepped into the Heavenly Body Tier, when had anyone ever insulted him as an old wretch right to his face like this? He humphed, and demanded, “Let him go!”

He was also familiar with the way a person like Zhao Ku had in handling matters, so he did not bother to talk reason with him. Instead, he directly told the latter to release the hostage.

“What if I don’t?” Zhao Ku was completely nonchalant. Aside from Ling Han, who had a Genesis Tier-level background which he could not compete with, there was really no one he truly took to heart.

Even for those of the current Imperial Family, he was not very wary, either. Wouldn’t it all come down to a competition of their respective fathers?

“Then I can only commit an offence!” Situ Jianyuan moved, and grabbed out at Zhao Ku. However, he observed proper behaviour in his movement. His purpose was only to save Situ Lin.

“You dare make a move against me?” Zhao Ku humphed coldly. A silvery light flashed over his body, and divine might spread out like he himself was a god that counterattacked against Situ Jianyuan.

The Silver Dragon Armor was active, providing a practically invincible defense for him. This was a defense that could not be broken through by anyone below the Eternal River Tier.

Situ Jianyuan was only capable of equalling Zhao Ku at first, but now, with the Silver Dragon Armor, he was naturally completely at a disadvantage. This was still because Zhao Ku had given the majority of his God Tools over to Ling Han. Otherwise, the former would only need to summon a decree, and he would be able to instantly blast Situ Jianyuan into dust.

Thankfully, Situ Jianyuan had no intention to have an all-out fight to the death with Zhao Ku. He deliberately tempted Zhao Ku to pursue himself, and then tossed the latter off his tail. Then, he returned and finally managed to save Situ Lin.

The pitiful Situ Lin’s expression was filled with gloom. He still had no idea why he had been beaten, and this caused a mouthful of resentment to be stuck in his heart, which he could not swallow no matter what he did. He should have fainted because of such heavy injuries in the first place, but because of this resentment, he was still wide awake, his eyes round.

If he did not clarify things, he would really die with a grievance remaining in his heart.

“Hehe, Brother Han, it’s been a long time.” Zhao Ku greeted Ling Han. He saw that Ling Han did not look angry, and calmed his heart. Otherwise, he would not have let things go so easily. He would definitely have killed Situ Lin.

Pu!

Situ Lin finally spat out a mouthful of blood; so that was the truth of the matter.

No wonder Zhao Ku almost beat him to death. So it seemed that the former had long since known Ling Han, and his action of attempting to drive a wedge between them must have angered Zhao Ku!

Additionally, even a spoilt young master like Zhao Ku respectfully addressed Ling Han as brother, so what kind of background would Ling Han possess?

It had to be Eternal River Tier, at the very least!

Gasp!

Situ Lin wanted to throw up blood again. He could feel his heart clench, and felt an incredible feeling of foreboding.

“We have much affinity to meet together,” Ling Han said, smiling. He was constantly thinking of that Silver Dragon Armor that Zhao Ku was wearing. If he could snatch it and give it to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, that would be great.

“Is Brother Han also here for the Highest Jade Essence Heart?” Zhao Ku asked cautiously. If his old man had seen his current behavior, he would definitely not believe that this was his actual son.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Are you also here for it?”

“No! No! How could that be!” Zhao Ku hurriedly shook his head. What a joke; how could he possibly dare to compete with Ling Han? “I am here to safeguard it for Brother Han. We’ll just see who dares compete with Brother Han; whoever dares to, I will deal with him!”

“Not bad, you have good judgement,” Ling Han said, smiling.

Zhao Ku’s eyes instantly lit up. Though he was now playing the lackey, if he managed to maintain a good relation with Ling Han, wouldn’t he then gain the support of a Genesis Tier? Then wouldn’t he be able to do as he liked in the whole Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire? He could kill whoever he liked, and could sleep with whoever he liked.

Just the mere thought of it caused him to be quite excited.

“Brother Han, please!” Zhao Ku respectfully led Ling Han into the auction house.

Situ Jianyuan watched the two men disappear before he then turned to Situ Lin, and demanded, “What’s going on?”

Situ Lin only felt incredibly wronged. How would he know what was going on? It was really such a coincidence. He had paid such a heavy price to invite Zhao Ku over, and had wanted to make use of the latter’s power to deal with his enemy, yet the end result was that he had slapped himself in the face.

“Trash, go back to the clan and reflect well on your errors!” Situ Jianyuan humphed. If they had offended Zhao Ku with this matter, and the Zhao Clan would thus bear a grudge against them, it was possible that the three great clans of Gathering Wind City would become the two great clans in future.

How could Situ Lin dare to speak another word? He could only leave pathetically, and the moment he left, all the mauled flesh on his entire body fell down, blood forming a massive pool on the ground; he was really too miserable.

In the auction house, Zhao Ku brought Ling Han into a private room like a lackey.

It had actually been reserved by Situ Lin, yet was now appropriated by Zhao Ku to gain Ling Han’s favor. If Situ Lin knew this, he would definitely spit out a few more mouthfuls of blood. It might even be possible that he would die out of pure fury.

In the private room, Zhao Ku maintained a fixed gaze. Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was just right beside him, but he did not give her a second look. He was practically more upright than any gentleman. A muscle twitched in Ling Han’s cheek. This was really too f****** much of an act. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Not long after, the auction began.

Ling Han did not have any interest in the other goods. He had come purposely for the Highest Jade Essence Heart. Thus, he had kept his eyes closed in rest all this while. Zhao Ku was chattering nonstop by his side, trying his best to gain Ling Han’s favor.

“Everyone, the item that will be auctioned next is the Highest Jade Essence Heart!” the auctioneer called out loudly, igniting everyone’s passion in a single instant. “The base price is 50,000,000 True Origin Stones, and every subsequent bid cannot be lower than 10,000,000!”

“50,000,000!” Zhao Ku immediately shouted loudly. “My father is Zhao Zuyi; who dares compete with me?”

This spoilt young master was incredibly arrogant. To flatter Ling Han and gain his favor, he was really trying his best.
