Chapter 3480: Seventh Extreme!

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Pa, pa, pa! The shackles inside Ling Han’s body started to shatter.

Ling Han looked pleasantly surprised. He had finally made the right bet.

No wonder no one could reach the Seventh Extreme, because this required the help of the millions and millions of Power of Dimensions inside one’s body. Just ask the world, aside from Ling Han, was there a second person that came out of the Divine Stone, and brought their own inner world?

If there was no one, then it proved that Ling Han’s path could not be replicated.

Kuang!

A furious bolt of lightning rang out. Winds and clouds gathered in the heaven and earth, forming terrifying thunderclouds. Silver snakes danced wildly, as if the heavens were furious, wanting to eliminate some evil existence. It was also as if the heavens were also excited, moved by an inconceivable existence.

“What’s going on? Why has there suddenly appeared a sudden clap of thunder?”

On the nine peaks, everyone was filled with fear.

The power of heaven and earth could not be fathomed, and could only be revered.

Now, the thunderclouds were so dense, and the shockwaves were so terrifying. To say nothing of Mystery Realm Tier elites, even Celestial Path Tier and above elites would probably be killed in the face of the wrath of the heavens.

‘■I heard my seniors say that only after advancing into Celestial Path, would the heavenly tribulation descend as a test,” someone said in a trembling voice.

“I have also heard of it, but the heaven’s calamity is not like that. Instead, it is directly aimed at the mind, and interrogates the Dao Heart,” the other person said. “If one passes, he will be met with good fortune. If he is defeated, the spirit will be shattered, and even reincarnation would be forbidden.

“Is this really a heaven’s calamity?”

There were a considerable number of people here that had come from prison. They had heard of something like the heaven’s calamity, but it did not match what their seniors had said.

If this was a heaven’s calamity, how terrifying would it be? It would directly destroy a living being in both physical and mental terms.

“Wu, the heaven and earth has been disturbed again?” Eldest Baby stopped eating ravenously.

Meanwhile, Second Baby swallowed the meat in her mouth, and said, “Such an astonishing phenomenon of heaven and earth, what kind of freakish freak has appeared again?”

“It should be Father,” Third Baby said with certainty. This proud child had the most confidence in Ling Han.

“Second, try tracing it back to its source,” Fourth Baby said.

Second Baby nodded and activated her ocular technique, chasing after the karma of the phenomenon.

“It’s indeed targeting the palace in the sky, but there are 1,2,7,6,5,3-. 12 people there, so it’s not definite that it is Father.” Second Baby counted with her hand for a while, then looked at the other six children and said.

“It must be Father.” Fourth Baby nodded.

“100% father.” Fifth Baby nodded as well.

“To be able to be so freakish, who else could it be but Father?” Sixth Baby concluded.

“Hu hu “Seventh Baby had fallen asleep at some point in time, and was presently snoring. Her small mouth was slightly open, and she was drooling. It was unknown what delicious food she had thought of.

And in the palace in the skies, the people inside did not have the slightest reaction, because the soundproofing of this palace was very good. No one could hear the commotion that was taking place outside, and the competition was presently incredibly intense, so how could they possibly have the mood to care about anything else?

Ling Han swallowed a Treasured Fruit of Life as he tore through his shackles. Pa, pa, pa! The shackles were endlessly torn apart, and after more than an hour, nineteen had already been torn open.

However, the energy of the first Treasured Fruit of Life was also exhausted. F***, this was a Mystery Realm Tier-level Treasured Fruit. It was so weak? Ling Han mocked internally, yet grabbed another Treasured Fruit of Life and ingested it without hesitation.

This Treasured Fruit was meant for him to break through, so what need was there for him to be reluctant?

On the contrary, the more Treasured Fruits one ate, it meant that the greater the improvement this time was, which was a good thing. It was a very good thing, something that others couldn’t even beg for.

As expected of Seventh Extreme, unattainable in this world. The improvement brought by this breakthrough was also incredibly terrifying.

Ling Han only needed to do one thing now, and that was to tear open the shackles as much as possible.

He no longer needed to care about his bones. After the breakthrough of Seventh Extreme began, his bones underwent a qualitative change. Originally, he had ground them into granules, and now these bone granules were further compressed, bone scraps excreted, and the remaining essence part was reconstructing.

More than an hour later, Ling Han ingested the third Treasured Fruit of Life. He was even a little shocked. The leap of Seventh Extreme was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

The improvement of the level of being was completely unstoppable. Ling Han ingested Treasured Fruit after Treasured Fruit. Thankfully, after ingesting the eighth Treasured Fruit, this rate of evolution finally slowed down.

This delay only lasted for half an hour, and the process of Seventh Extreme finally ended.

Ling Han did some calculations. He had broken through at least over a hundred shackles.

What kind of concept was this?

Many people may not have broken through so many shackles altogether, from Blood Transformation all the way to Mystery Realm Tier.

Then wouldn’t Ling Han be capable of matching the battle prowess of Mystery Realm Tier elites?

This could not be calculated that way.

Cultivation level was cultivation level, and this was real and solid. Furthermore, Ling Han had broken through even more of his shackles, which would make his battle prowess in this cultivation level even more terrifying, and allow him to rush to a higher height in future.

Actually, the latter was more important.

The benefit of the leap in level of being was that the upper limit of his mystical power could be increased again. Additionally, there was also the improvement of his spiritual power. This was a leap.

Unfortunately, this was still not enough to release the empress and the others _ he, who was weaker in abilities, could send them out, but they could not withstand the pressure of this world, and would be directly reduced to ashes. Furthermore, their own abilities were too strong, so Ling Han still could not move them.

Going by this trend, if he could still break the limits of his cultivation level at every cultivation level, then perhaps in Enlightenment Tier or Mystery Realm Tier, he would be enough to bring Heavenly Venerable Tier-level creatures out of the inner world.

He had experienced it himself, and believed that Heavenly Venerable Tier elites should be able to withstand the pressure of this heaven and earth. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The day of a true reunion with his family and friends was not far off.

Ling Han had mastered Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique and the secret technique of the stone wall. Coupled with the heaven and earth environment that had almost recovered, his cultivation speed could be said to be overwhelmingly fast. As long as he had enough Treasured Fruits of Life, he was confident that he could rush up to the Mystery Realm Tier within a year. However, he only had one Treasured Fruit of Life left in his possession, and even if breaking through to the Inscription Tier wasn’t as freakish as breaking through to the Seventh Extreme, he still needed eight Mystery Realm Tier-level Treasured Fruits of Life. However, there was only one… would that be enough?

He had to prepare a few more, right?

Sigh, Ling Han sighed. As it turned out, the fast advancement of cultivation level also had such a problem.

-If this was known to others, they would definitely scold him for showing off. Anyone would want to have this kind of trouble.

Ling Han glanced at the golem, and decided not to waste any more time. He was already a few days behind.

He assimilated with the golem, and after getting used to it slightly, he immediately went to push open the doors to the palace.

Without much effort, the door was opened.

His current power… was probably 100,000kg!

When he was in Sixth Extreme, his power was 75,oookg. This was only an increase of a minor level of cultivation level, and there was actually such a great leap?

Seventh Extreme was indeed freakish.

Ling Han believed that his current battle prowess was enough to match the middle stage or even the late stage of the Enlightenment Tier, and after breaking through to the Inscription Tier, it was obviously no issue for him to sweep aside all other Enlightenment Tier opponents.

He controlled the golem and walked into the palace.

The light was blinding. Thankfully, he was in a clay figure, so his eyes couldn’t see things, so it didn’t matter. His divine sense could sense objects, but couldn’t “see” the color, so there was absolutely no difference whether there was light or not.

He strode forwards. Having fallen behind by so many days, it was unknown where the eight people in front of him had reached..
