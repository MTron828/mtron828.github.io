Chapter 1807: Shameless Sneak Attack

People gathered from all different directions, and they started to climb the mountain before them.

After reaching this place, even elites at the Immortal Palace Tier wouldn’t be able to advance without a suit of Blood Dragon Armor. The fire particles here were far too powerful, and they would kill anyone who wasn’t wearing Blood Dragon Armor.

However, Ling Han was an exception. He possessed the Nine Heavens Flame, and he also possessed the Flame Control Technique. Thus, this place didn’t pose any danger to him whatsoever. Instead, it was much like a playground.

He wasn’t wearing a suit of Blood Dragon Armor, yet the others wouldn’t be able to see this. Instead, they would think that he was wearing the suit of armor underneath his clothes. If they discovered the truth, however, they would all be transfixed with shock and disbelief. After all, what kind of freak could stand here without wearing a suit of Blood Dragon Armor? Even Immortal Palace Tier elites couldn’t achieve such a feat!

“Ling Han, die!” someone roared. Ling Han glanced over, only to see someone charging over with a staff. The symbols on the staff were all glowing, and they were radiating with a formidable aura as the staff smashed down at his head.

This person seemed extremely unfamiliar. However, his cultivation was extraordinary, and it was clear that he was a fourth severance elite. His battle prowess was supreme, and even if he hadn’t reached the level of king tier, he was definitely very close to doing so.

Anyhow, this person clearly wasn’t attacking Ling Han on a whim. Instead, he had been waiting for him for a long time. Not only had he activated the full power of his Pseudo-Celestial Tool, but he had even unleashed a formidable secret technique that formed an image of heaven and earth behind him. The auras of yin and yang circulated through this image.

As his staff slammed down, it was as if heaven and earth were about to be obliterated. Perhaps even Luo Changfeng and Zihe Bingyun could only retreat in the face of such a ferocious attack. In their haste, they definitely wouldn’t be able to muster enough battle prowess to rival this attack.

After all, this was a sneak attack against an unprepared enemy!

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel slightly infuriated. If his opponent had challenged him head-on, he wouldn’t have viewed them in contempt no matter what. In fact, he might even spare them if he won.

But a sneak attack?

Boom!

The person charged over, and his staff arrived before he had even reached Ling Han. The inky black staff smashed toward Ling Han’s head, and it was clear that the person yearned to kill Ling Han in a single strike.

The Empress humphed coldly, and she was just about to counterattack. However, Ling Han placed a hand on her shoulder, and this dissolved her urge to charge forward.

Ling Han slowly looked up.

Pa!

He caught the iron staff with a single hand.

Boom!

This was a devastating collision, and a ripple of shock waves shot through Ling Han’s body before bursting into the surrounding space. The shock waves were far too powerful, yet thanks to his freakish physique, they weren’t able to injure him at all. In fact, the destructive shock waves hadn’t been able to enter his body, and they had only rippled across the surface of his skin.

There was a deafening rumble, and the area where Ling Han was standing instantly caved in. At the same time, a web of fractures spread into the surroundings.

A swirl of violent aura threw dust into the air as it radiated into the distance.

The nearby cultivators couldn’t help but stop to gaze at the commotion.

They raised their brows, and expressions of astonishment spread across their faces.

Ling Han had actually blocked that earth-shattering attack head-on?

‘Is he a f*cking human?!’

Even Ling Han’s assailant was stunned upon seeing this. He definitely hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would be so powerful. One had to realize that he had already prepared this strike for an extremely long time. Moreover, he was attacking an unsuspecting target, so he should have been able to crush Ling Han without any doubt!

Ling Han humphed before pulling with his hand, causing the iron staff to crash toward him. At the same time, his assailant was forced to stumble over along with his staff.

His expression changed drastically, and he frantically shot back in retreat. At this moment, he simply wanted to flee.

“Trying to escape?” Ling Han asked. He unleashed his aura.

Boom!

This aura was like a tsunami, and it caused the limbs of his assailant to shudder, stopping him in his tracks.

Heaven’s might!

This technique was relatively ineffective against king tiers. However, his assailant hadn’t reached such a level yet, so he was naturally affected by the overwhelming heaven’s might. Although he was only affected for a split-second, this was already enough for Ling Han.

Ling Han dashed over and threw a punch as he did so.

Pa!

The man’s head exploded into bits of broken flesh and brain. This was an extremely brutal and bloody scene.

Peng!

Ling Han activated his Origin Power protective barrier, stopping the blood and broken flesh from striking his body.

He then swept his cold gaze across the surroundings, with his silent warning easily understood by everyone present.

This was the fate for those who dared to target him.

Upon catching his gaze, all of the nearby cultivators involuntarily lowered their heads. They didn’t dare to make eye contact with him. Even those who were secretly checking out the Empress didn’t dare to look at her anymore.

This person was far too powerful, and he was also far too merciless.

‘That assailant was from the Qianzhao Clan, right?’

“Ling Han, how audacious! You actually dared to kill my subordinate!” a young man said with a cold humph as he stepped forward. He was wearing a yellow robe that was decorated with the embroidery of 100 lively beasts, each of which was radiating with a terrifying and vicious might.

Ling Han glanced at him, and asked, “Can’t they be killed?”

“My subordinate simply wanted to spar with you,” the young man replied. “Yet, you actually killed him with such ruthlessness! You’re taking things too far!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle and say, “You’re calling his sneak attack a request for sparing? Your shamelessness truly knows no bounds. Oh, that’s right, I’ve forgotten to ask for your name. Come, come, come, tell me who you are.”

Anger flashed across the young man’s face, and he said with a humph, “The Qianzhao Clan’s Qianzhao Yang!”

“Oh, it’s that dogsh*t clan again!” Ling Han said in disdain. For some reason, he had an inherent dislike for the name of this clan. He would feel angry every time he heard the mention of it.

“Woof!” The large black dog was extremely displeased upon hearing this, and he immediately lunged over to bite Ling Han. “Brat, your tongue is so toxic!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ling Han dashed aside with a smile, and said, “There are good people and bad people, so there are naturally good dogs and bad dogs as well. Don’t make a connection with yourself every time I mention something to do with dogs. It’s as if you’re eager to let others know that you’re a scheming and mischievous dog.”

The large black dog was enraged upon hearing this, and he started to snap his jaws as he chased after Ling Han.

Qianzhao Yang’s expression darkened. He was one of the potential successors of the Qianzhao Clan, and his status was, in fact, even higher than that of Qianzhao Gao. Moreover, he was at the peak stage of the fourth severance, and he could already advance to the Dividing Soul Tier. It was only because he wanted to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm one more time that he had suppressed his urge to advance.

‘You people actually dare to ignore me?!

‘F*ck!’

“You’re seeking death!!” Qianzhao Yang roared as he resolutely launched an attack. Although his subordinate had been insta-killed by Ling Han just then, he was also extremely confident that he could have achieved the same feat. Thus, he was completely unafraid of Ling Han. Of course, being unafraid was one matter, and he was still extremely wary of Ling Han’s strength. Right now, he was unleashing this celestial technique with his full power.

“Myriad Sword Technique!” he roared as he patted his waist. Countless golden swords instantly shot forth, with each of them measuring three feet in length. There were at least 10,000 swords, and each of them was filled with a dense pattern of symbols. Moreover, the swords were arranged in some kind of formation, and they were all able to resonate with each other.

Ling Han looked up with an expression of slight interest. He wasn’t interested in the celestial technique, but he was rather interested in the treasured swords.

They were all composed of One-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal!

To him, even 10-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal and Level 20 Godly metal were essentially the same thing. They were nothing more than materials for the Divine Demon Sword to engulf. However, he was still overjoyed to see so much Pseudo-Divine Metal at once.

This would be a fruitful harvest.

With a flash, the Empress immediately dashed forward. She wasn’t a delicate woman who needed the protection of a man. Instead, she was the peerlessly domineering Empress Luan Xing!

“Young lady, I don’t want to hurt you, so hurry up and stand back!” Qianzhao Yang immediately shouted. The Empress was so beautiful that he couldn’t bear to attack her.
