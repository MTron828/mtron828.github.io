Chapter 963: Third Success!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What was a God Tool?

If a divine pattern was carved on a weapon, then the weapon would release a unique might once the divine pattern was activated. Thereupon, the weapon would become a God Tool.

The materials used to craft God Tools weren’t limited to Godly metals. It was just that metals were the most widely used material, and as a result, a large majority of God Tools was made using Godly metals.

And now, a divine pattern had actually appeared on Ling Han’s Mountain River. This signified that, from a certain perspective, his Mountain River could be considered as a God Tool.

An extreme weight God Tool.

He could activate the divine pattern with a mere thought, thereby imbuing his attacks with an extreme weight effect, which increased his battle prowess.

Pa!

A few hours later, the Mountain River Stone in his hand once again crumbled into dust.

‘I’m almost one-third of the way to the late stage of the low extreme.

‘As expected. The higher one’s cultivation level, the more Mountain River Stones are needed to level up. In fact, the increase in Mountain River Stones needed is quite astonishing. When I reach the perfection level, I’ll probably need hundreds of Mountain River Stones just to rise by a sub-minor level.

‘Let me try again.’

He prepared to reach the island for the third time.

“My God! He’s trying to reach the island for the third time?”

Everyone felt dizzy with disbelief upon seeing Ling Han step forward again.

“Oi, oi, oi... Is this real?”

“Has anyone achieved this before?”

“No, definitely not!”

Everyone shook their heads vigorously. Although very few people had managed to reach the island twice, there was always that one or two every several thousand years. During times when prodigies appeared in large numbers, perhaps three or four people would manage to reach the island twice within a century.

However, there was no precedent of someone reaching the island three times.

“Yes, someone has!” someone suddenly exclaimed firmly.

“Who?”

“It was around 300,000 years ago. There was a tremendous prodigy—”

“Xu Ran!”

“Indeed, it was Xu Ran. It’s rumored that he reached the island a miraculous three times. Afterward, he instantly shot to fame. However, he suddenly disappeared for some reason.”

“Who’s Xu Ran?” Most people had never heard this name before.

Ling Han couldn’t care less about what others thought, and he calmly stepped onto the first stone. This time, he wasn’t in a hurry to advance. Instead, he activated the divine pattern on the Mountain River Stone to resist the gravity fields.

Weng!

A gravity field was also unleashed from his body, though its effect was naturally much weaker than those that existed on the stones. However, it was still able to provide a certain degree of resistance.

‘As expected!’

Ling Han nodded in his mind. Zhao Lun had most likely refined his Mountain River Stone after reaching the island for the first time. Then, he used his gravity field to resist the gravity fields of the stones, and was thus able to succeed in reaching the island for a second time.

Of course, the main reason was still due to his powerful abilities. These special extreme weight Mountain River Stones could only add an icing to the cake. If one was too weak, their effect would be meaningless.

Ling Han started pushing forward.

The first 30 stones were extremely easy to cross. However, a look of exertion appeared on his face when he crossed the next 30 stones. Afterward, his body swayed with every step that he took.

The 80th stone!

He stopped on this stone, and sweat poured down his forehead. The Godly bones in his body were all clacking under the immense pressure.

“Heavens! He’s actually reached the 80th stone! He’s only just advanced to the late stage of the low extreme!”

“Gasp! He’ll definitely be able to complete three visits in another 10 years!”

Everyone wore different expressions, many of them malicious. He was a super-genius, so they definitely couldn’t allow him to grow!

Ling Han didn’t persist. Instead, he turned around and retreated.

He started refining his last Mountain River Stone. He was determined to plunder this island as if it were a treasure vault.

After refining the Mountain River Stone, Ling Han reached two-thirds of the way to the late stage of the low extreme. This speed was incredibly terrifying.

However, the Heavenly Sea Mystery Realm only opened once every 10 years, and the number of people who could obtain Mountain River Stones was also very small. It was especially rare that someone could obtain five Mountain River Stones as he had.

A second divine pattern appeared on the large mountain in his Dantian.

“The power of the gravity field has doubled,” Ling Han whispered to himself. Sure enough, the improvement at the start was the greatest. After forming the third divine pattern, however, the power of the gravity field only increased by 50%.

“You can probably make it this time!” There was an expectant look in Shui Yanyu’s eyes as she nodded at Ling Han.

‘Reaching the island three times is a miracle.

‘Can this man perform a miracle?’ Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Ling Han will definitely succeed!” Hu Feiyun had a blind trust in Ling Han’s abilities. That evil beast before had been “killed” by Ling Han, so what difficulty did this pose?

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Of course. I’ll definitely succeed this time.”

He stepped forward again.

It was indeed different from before. He had two extreme weight divine patterns now, and when he activated them, they could provide a large amount of resistance to the gravity fields on the stones. Moreover, as his cultivation level had soared dramatically, his power had naturally also increased immensely. As a result, he was able to easily cross the first 80 stones.

After that, his speed started to slow down.

His expression became strained, but he still managed to reach the 90th stone in no time at all.

The most important steps were these last 10 steps. This was the true challenge.

91, 92, 93...

Everyone looked on intently. Were they going to see the birth of a legend?

One had to realize that Ling Han still hadn’t reached the peak stage of the low extreme yet. As such, he still had quite some room for improvement. If he succeeded this time, didn’t that mean he could perhaps try to reach the island for a fourth time?

This was far too terrifying!

97, 98, 99... He was only one step away!

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face as he took one last step forward. He had reached the island.

Third success!

Sinister killing intent instantly appeared on many people’s faces, most of whom were from the Eternity Sky and Jade Drop Majestic Empires. It was very likely that such a genius could reach the Heavenly Body Tier. Moreover, the increase or decrease in number of such cultivators could directly influence the strength of a Majestic Empire.

They had to kill him before he became too powerful.

Ling Han wasn’t greedy this time, and only picked up one Mountain River Stone before being ejected back onto the bank. He immediately refined this Mountain River Stone and raised his cultivation level to a stage close to the peak stage of the low extreme.

‘I only need four or five more Mountain River Stones to reach the pinnacle of the low extreme.

‘However, even so, it’s still impossible for me to break through to the medium extreme. After all, I’ve fully relied on external items to advance my cultivation level, yet my body doesn’t have the corresponding comprehension.

‘When I get back, I need to calm down and take my time to comprehend this cultivation level.

‘However, the more Mountain River Stones I obtain, the better. I can use them for the medium extreme, high extreme, and even perfection level. It’s best if they contain special attributes as well, for those can also elevate my battle prowess.’

Although Ling Han knew that it was close to impossible to achieve, he still tried to reach the island for the fourth time. It came as no surprise that he failed. In fact, he was a long way off, and only managed to advance a dozen or so steps.

‘By the looks of it, I need to stabilize my cultivation level in addition to reaching the pinnacle of the low extreme if I want to reach the island for a fourth time.

‘I only have a mere 10 years... Do I have a chance to enter here again?’

Ling Han felt that this wasn’t likely. It was much more likely that he would make some preparations then strive to reach the medium extreme after leaving this place. This probably wouldn’t take 10 years.

‘Then I have to maximize gains this time.’
