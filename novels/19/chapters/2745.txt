2746 Might Unleashed

Ling Feifan was astonished as he looked at Ling Han. Was this Ling Han’s ability?

This was far too incredible! In just three days—even though he felt like several years had passed—his strength had undergone a complete transformation. This was absolutely godly.

“Stinky brat, hurry up and give yourself a clean. It’s time to fight for your wife,” Ling Han said as he kicked his grandson in the rear.

Ling Feifan came to his senses, and immediately scampered off.

After a while, Ling Han and Ling Feifan left the Celestial Guest Residence and headed back to the An Clan.

It had to be said that the An Clan was an extremely capable clan. In less than three days, they had already finished the reconstruction of the An Clan, which exuded the domineering aura of a Heavenly-Venerable-Tier clan. In fact, weaker-willed people wouldn’t even be able to approach the An Clan. Instead, they would go weak in the knees.

Ling Han appeared as calm as could be as he walked with his hands clasped behind his back. Meanwhile, Ling Feifan obediently followed after him.

“How are your parents?” Ling Han asked.

“They’re as lovey-dovey as could be. It’s as if they’re joined together at the hip, and they’re never apart from each other no matter what they do,” Ling Feifan replied as he fiddled around with a greatsword in his hand. This was a Celestial Tool that Ling Han had only just forged for him.

With Ling Han’s current ability, forging a Divine Metal billet into a finished weapon was naturally as simple as a single thought.

“They’re traveling and sightseeing all the time, and they even traveled through numerous dimensions. Right now, they’re helping the Promise City Realm resist invasion. Thanks to them, I was forced to become a soldier as well. In the end, I was taken prisoner,” Ling Feifan said through sighs.

Ling Han was surprised upon hearing this. Able to travel through dimensions? Had Ling Jianxue already become a Heavenly Venerate?

“What cultivation is your father at?” Ling Han asked.

“Ninth Heaven Celestial King.”

Ling Han was even more surprised. As a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he could already travel through the dimensions? Did he truly possess such strength?

“Father was extremely fortunate, and he obtained an extremely mysterious pearl. As long as he activates it, he can conceal his presence such that even Heavenly Venerates can’t discover him,” Ling Feifan explained.

Only at this moment did Ling Han understand. Otherwise, he refused to believe that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could truly travel through dimensions.

In any case, traveling through the myriad worlds might allow Ling Jianxue to discover rare opportunities that could potentially help him become a Heavenly Venerate. This was Ling Jianxue’s cultivation method.

As they chatted, they eventually arrived before the gates of the An Clan.

There was already a person waiting for them, and upon seeing their arrival, they immediately bowed, and said, “Our respsects to Lord.”

This greeting was aimed at Ling Han, yet Ling Feifan proudly nodded in response as if the greeting were aimed at him. This almost angered the person to death—he was a Third Heaven Celestial King!

Ling Han raised a hand, and said, “Lead the way.”

The Third Heaven Celestial King didn’t dare to defy Ling Han, so he obediently led the way. A short while later, the three of them arrived at the guest hall, where An Tayun and Yang Zhihe were sitting in the master seat and guest seat, respectively. Meanwhile, An Xiu’er and Yang Xuanlong were standing behind them.

An Xiu’er’s eyes instantly lit up when she saw Ling Feifan. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Xuanlong saw this, and he involuntarily clenched his fists, swearing in his mind that he would definitely find an opportunity to kill Ling Feifan in a while.

Yang Xuanlong had only met An Xiu’er a few times before, so it couldn’t be said that he liked her. However, for the sake of his father’s grand plan, it was vital that he married An Xiu’er. In any case, he wasn’t against this, as An Xiu’er was genuinely a noblewoman who was extremely delicate and beautiful. She was completely worthy of him.

Thus, he didn’t oppose this marriage. However, she had yet to be married, yet she was already making eyes at another man. How could he accept this? How could he not develop killing intent?

Wasn’t the greatest hate of a man being cucked by someone else?

“Begin the battle,” An Tayun said with a wave of his hand. A small tower appeared in mid-air, measuring nine levels in height. It was golden in color and exuding an aura of chaos as if it belonged to the primal beginning of heaven and earth.

This was a Heavenly Venerate Tool. This was a battle between two Celestial Kings, so it was naturally better for them to do battle inside there. Otherwise, the newly reconstructed An Clan might be obliterated again.

The two youths leaped toward the tower.

An Xiu’er couldn’t help but say, “Be careful, Feifan.”

“Rest assured, I can take on 10 of this trash by myself,” Ling Feifan said with a wave of his hand. He appeared as casual as could be.

Yang Xuanlong was almost angered to death, with his killing intent becoming even more intense. He stepped into the treasured tower, deciding that he would definitely kill Ling Feifan.

Even An Tayun and Yang Zhihe wore displeased expressions, with An Tayun saying, “Xiu’er, ladies need to be more reserved and modest!”

As for Yang Zhihe, he humphed to express his displeasure.

Meanwhile, Ling Han laughed heartily, saying, “Young lady, come here, come here.”

An Xiu’er already knew his identity, so she immediately walked over, curtseying slightly and saying, “My respects to Grandpa.”

Ling Han retrieved a Spatial God Tool, holding it over, and saying, “Here, a greeting gift, take it.”

“Thank you, Grandpa,” An Xiu’er said obediently. However, upon observing it with her divine sense, she couldn’t help but gasp. There were countless high-level Celestial medicines inside this Spatial God Tool, and there were even several pieces of Divine Metal. Their value was immense.

This greeting gift… was absolutely exquisite.

Meanwhile, inside the Heavenly Venerate Tool, the battle between Ling Feifan and Yang Xuanlong had also begun.

Inside this space, everything was subject to An Tayun’s whims. Thus, he commanded the Heavenly Venerate Tool to suppress Yang Xuanlong’s cultivation to the First Heaven.

Even so, Yang Xuanlong definitely still possessed a huge advantage. Firstly, his cultivation was at the peak stage of the First Heaven. Secondly, he was more familiar with the Regulations, so he was naturally able to channel them with more nuance and skill.

However, Ling Feifan’s response astonished him greatly.

This was because Ling Feifan didn’t attempt to draw on the Regulations or whatnot. Instead, he immediately charged over to pummel the opponent.

This was far too classless. Was such close-quarters combat any different from a scuffle between hooligans? Was his opponent really a Celestial King?

However, he immediately discovered that Ling Feifan’s punches were astonishingly powerful, with his chest throbbing with each punch that he withstood. He felt terrible, and he truly wanted to cough blood. Moreover, not only were Ling Feifan’s punches powerful, but they were also quick. It wasn’t long before he couldn’t keep up.

He had initially been filled with confidence. After all, what did it matter even if his opponent were genuinely freakish? He could still unleash his Heavenly Venerate Techniques. This was something that Ling Feifan definitely couldn’t block.

Now, however, what opportunity did he have to unleash the Heavenly Venerate Technique?

Peng, peng, peng!

Ling Feifan’s fists rained down with fury, giving Yang Xuanlong no opportunity to unleash his trump card.

“Incapable scum, you actually dared to lay eyes on my wife?!” Ling Feifan spat with extreme disdain as he continued to pummel his opponent.

Yang Xuanlong was completely unable to reply. All he could do was defend with all his might.

However, he was bound to make a mistake. One could fail in their attacks 100 times or 10,000 times with no consequence at all. However, defending was different, and as long as a single mistake was committed, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Under Ling Feifan’s relentless attacks, Yang Xuanlong was eventually struck by a fist, which caused his bones to immediately snap. He groaned in pain.

At the same time, he retreated in a hurry. If they continued to battle head-on, he would definitely be defeated.

After creating enough distance, he started preparing his trump card.

“Ling Feifan, it all ends now!” he roared as he raised his hands to the sky, flickers of white flames dancing across his palms.

They were radiant daylight flames, capable of annihilating all matter.

However, Ling Feifan couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed. He had initially thought that his furious attacks would strip Yang Xuanlong of the opportunity to launch his trump card. However, prodigies were prodigies, after all, and Yang Xuanlong was ultimately able to break free from his attacks.

He shook his hands, feeling intense pain in his bones. Indeed, his Body Art had been rapidly elevated in just a few days, meaning that he didn’t possess a physique powerful enough to match it. Thus, the relentless attacks just then had placed a huge burden on his body.

“Stop dreaming. Your only fate is to be pummeled into paste!” Ling Feifan said with a laugh.
