Chapter 1103: Going Solo

“En, to confirm whether it’s real or fake, we only need to have the Asura Demon Emperor enter and test it out.”

Ling Han put away the puppet. There were no True Origin Stones inserted inside; hence, it could only do some simple transformations. It was not equipped with any real power.

When he put away the puppet, light suddenly flashed before his eyes. After he had appeared in the stone statue formation, people were running towards him from both sides. It was as if none of them had realized that he had previously vanished for a period of time.

Though this period of time was not long, it was still as long as a few breaths’ time, yet not one person had realized it?

The means of a great elite were truly amazing.

“Ling Han!”

“Master!”

Both Shui Yanyu and Ding Ping ran over, the admiration on their faces not the slightest bit concealed.

It had really been too difficult. Even such unprecedented prodigies like Xia Wuque could only give up, but Ling Han, who was merely in the high extreme, actually successfully passed the test. With such a comparison, it was clear how incredible such an achievement was.

“Congratulations, Brother Ling!” Shao Sisi and the others also walked over.

In the meanwhile, Xia Wuque humphed coldly. He hesitated slightly, and then strode off with the spear-wielding man and his other subordinates.

He wanted to kill Ling Han, but going by the current situation, it seemed to be difficult to do so. Putting aside that freakish defense of Ling Han’s, Shao Sisi and the others would definitely not allow him to do so. Thus, he chose to leave; what the eye didn’t see, the heart didn’t grieve over.

Some people came over to strike up a conversation with Ling Han, but with Shao Sisi and the others there, their presence was really too strong, intimidating the masses so much that they could barely speak. Soon enough, they left as well.

Shao Sisi and the others were of the mind to befriend Ling Han, and ensured their attitudes were extremely humble. However, this was not a good place for conversation. Thus, the four of them made an agreement to sit down and have a nice chat after entering into the Majestic Heaven Sect.

The crowd dispersed. Everyone felt a little disappointed because they had “seen with their own eyes” that Ling Han had walked out of the stone statue formation, yet had not obtained any reward.

Despite going through such difficulty, he had not gained anything. This was naturally a disappointment.

When the masses had dispersed, Ling Han tossed out that metal ball, and said, “Little Asura, try entering into this puppet.” He had already filled in True Origin Stones.

The Asura Demon Emperor quickly did as he commanded. Bang , this human-shaped puppet immediately stamped a foot down, exuding an incredibly terrifying aura.

“M-Master, this is a Sun Moon Tier puppet!” he uttered in a trembling voice, almost about to pass out.

Previously, when the two pseudo-Sun Moon Tier puppets had been lost, he had almost died of heartache. After possessing immense power, and then losing it, who would be capable of glossing over it? He had never thought that after only about a year’s time passed, his master would’ve gained a true Sun Moon Tier puppet.

This was too awesome!

“Try it out, what level has it reached?” Ling Han asked.

After the Asura Demon Emperor made a few movements, he replied, “In reply to Master, it should be in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.”

“Only in the medium extreme!” Ling Han was slightly dissatisfied, but since it had been free, his demand should not be too high, should it? He nodded, and said, “This puppet is yours to use.”

“Thank you, Master. This Little Asura will work even harder, be cautious and conscientious, meticulous, strive to the utmost...” The Asura Demon Emperor was again expressing his position.

He had now gained a puppet of Sun Moon Tier, but he did not dare to have the slightest thought of rebellion. His wildness had long since been worn away by Ling Han. In his mind, since Ling Han could give him a Sun Moon Tier puppet to use with a light heart, this meant that he had an even stronger trump card in hand, and could easily subdue him.

He had not guessed wrongly on this part. However, even if Ling Han did not possess something like the Vajra Seal, he could still easily recapture the Asura Demon Emperor.

The Asura Demon Emperor’s divine sense’s level was too low, after all. Ling Han needed only use the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique to knock him out, and then easily draw him into the Black Tower. By that time, he could then easily do with him as he liked.

Ling Han healed his body first as it no longer was subject to the attack of the stone statues. With the channelling of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his recovery abilities were amazing, and very soon, he became completely uninjured.

He changed into a new suit of robes, and smilingly said, “Let’s go.”

The three people and one puppet set off, continuing on their journey.

On the way, Ling Han told Shui Yanyu and Ding Ping how he had obtained three divine seals and the puppet.

“The person buried here... who exactly is it?”

“It doesn’t feel like a tomb. How could he still be so leisurely and refined after death?”

Shui Yanyu and Ding Ping both felt that it was inconceivable. Just think, you could have just buried yourself good and proper, so why had you come up with so many antics?

“Unwilling to remain lonely?” Ling Han murmured. In the end, no one could escape death. Perhaps this great elite sang his own praises because he did not want to be forgotten? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The life essence here was very amazing. Not only could it advance one’s cultivation level, it could also heal the hidden injuries one had received during cultivation, and fully nurture his body. This was a very immense help.

Some simply chose not to continue exploring, thinking that their abilities were too weak, and they would not be able to win over the others. Hence, they found a quiet place, stopped, and began to cultivate and nurse themselves. Nursing their bodies to the prime condition was naturally beneficial to cultivation.

“Master, I have broken through!” Only after a few days, Ding Ping thus exclaimed.

With Ling Han’s alchemical pills forcefully pouring into him, his cultivation level naturally increased rapidly. This was the Immortal Realm, and it was comparatively easy for one to advance in the mortal territory of cultivation levels. In terms of mental state, he had the Reincarnation Tree. If it were not for the fact that Ding Ping still had to advance to the pinnacle of 19 stars of strength, he could have broken through long ago.

Ling Han stood guard for him. Even in the galaxy, the Regulations of the Heavenly Dao were everywhere. Immediately, divine thunder could be heard, and lightning began to strike madly at Ding Ping.

Ding Ping had cultivated Shattering Void Tier almost to perfection, but because he was not the master of a small world, he had no hope of reaching 20 stars of strength. However, 19 stars was still extremely awesome. This allowed his battle prowess to be incredibly frightening, and the heavenly tribulation he had to endure was relatively easier.

After half a day, he had also advanced into Immortal level.

“Master, may I travel around on my own?” He was filled with longing, hoping that he could be like his three uncles, travelling extensively and learning through experience on his own.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “So, your wings have hardened then?”

Ding Ping was so scared he quickly knelt, and exclaimed, “Disciple dares not!”

Ling Han thought for a moment, then drew out the Swift Cloud Talisman, and handed it over to this disciple. He said, “Take it. In a dangerous situation, it will help you escape. In the future, we shall reunite at the entrance.”

“Master!” Ding Ping was incredibly touched. This was something that his master had obtained by surviving the stone statue formation, and was extremely valuable.

“Take it!” Ling Han said smilingly. He had the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, so the Swift Cloud Talisman was not as useful to him as one would think.

Ding Ping knelt and bowed respectfully towards Ling Han. Only then did he take the Swift Cloud Talisman, and left in big strides.

“Are you really at ease?” Shui Yanyu questioned.

Ling Han did not speak. After a while, he said, “The boy’s grown up, so I should allow him to soar. Furthermore, when I was at the cultivation level that he is presently at, didn’t I run all the way to the Imperial Capital on my own and woo myself a beautiful girl?”

Shui Yanyu knew that he was teasing her, and couldn’t help but roll her eyes. Yet, at the same time, she was slightly pleased. What woman did not like hearing her love compliment her on her beauty?

Ling Han laughed loudly, wrapped his arms around this seductive beauty, and kissed her.

Shui Yanyu was greatly embarrassed, and pointing at the Asura Demon Emperor, exclaimed, “There’s still someone here!”

The Asura Demon Emperor was stunned, and hurriedly crouched down and barked like a dog. He even wanted to wag his tail, yet realized that he was no longer that wolf. Involuntarily, he felt a little awkward, and grinning sheepishly, said, “Mistress, don’t think of this Little Asura as a person!”

He was indeed quite shameless.
