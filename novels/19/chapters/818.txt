Chapter 819: Lunar King Battles Yi Shuang Shuang

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yet Ling Han raised his clasped hands smilingly, and greeted, “Lord Lunar King has arrived, apologies for not coming out to greet you!”

“Gegegege!” An incredibly seductive bout of laughter spread out from within the carriage, causing those who heard it to feel as if they had been stroked by uncountable small hands. Slightly itchy, and a bit silky.

“Huge vixen!” Yi Shuang Shuang and Hu Niu declared at the same time.

The carriage door opened, and a voluptuous, incredibly seductive beauty walked out. In terms of looks, Yi Shuang Shuang could match her, but in terms of bearing, though Yi Shuang Shuang was graceful as well, when compared with the former, she paled.

This was an extraordinary inborn beauty. She was born to enchant the whole world, a real calamity.

It was naturally no other than the Lunar King.

“Yo, Little Brother!” the Lunar King greeted gracefully, then with hands on her hips, put on an incredibly seductive pose. Anyone who saw her would blush. “Look, haven’t I become younger and more beautiful?”

Ling Han’s initial understanding of women was on the level of an idiot. That was why he’d only realized that the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden actually liked him only after a millenium had passed. But as he was in intimate contact with Helian Xun Xue, there was naturally a little improvement to his understanding.

“En, the Lunar King is indeed younger and more beautiful as days pass!” he complimented.

This great viven had once gotten into a fight with Ma Duo Bao over the issue of her youth. Thus, he definitely had to go along with her on this matter. The current him was quite capable of withstanding a beating, but with an elite on the level of the Lunar King, even if she could not kill him in a single move, it probably wouldn’t be all that difficult for her to give him an agonizing beating.

The Lunar King was instantly all smiles. Then, she turned to look at Yi Shuang Shuang, and asked, “May I ask how should I address you, Big Sister?”

“I would not dare to be any big sister!” Yi Shuang Shuang’s beautiful face instantly cooled. “From what I see, you are much older than me!”

“How could that be, one look at that skin, and I know that Big Sister is definitely at least a few millenia older than me!” The Lunar King really dared to say whatever she wanted.

A vein immediately popped on Yi Shuang Shuang’s forehead, yet she still smiled, and said, “I heard you guys have been buried for more than twenty millenia. Tsk, tsk, tsk, that would be much older than me, so you are the real Big Sister! No, no, no, not Big Sister, but rather Grandma!”

The Lunar King giggled delicately, and said, “I only napped for a short while. With Time Source Fluid to slow down the passage of time on my body, I have only slept a few years at most. I would not dare be treated as a grandmother, so I had best return the respectful address to Big Sister!”

“Big Sister!”

“You are the Big Sister here, your whole family are Big Sisters!”

The two women glared at each other as their temper flared up.

Ling Han really didn’t understand. It was only an address, so what was so important about it? Looking at the way these two women were acting, they seemed to be ready to immediately start a fight. Hiss, that destructive power would definitely exceed the time when Yi Shuang Shuang was fighting the Beast Snake King previously. It could practically be claimed to be on another level.

Yet Hu Niu was ecstatic, and said quietly, “Fight, fight quickly, it’s best that both of them are beaten to death!”

Ling Han advised, “Lord Lunar King, your long journey must have been difficult. Why not come down for a cup of tea?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Get lost!” Both women moved at the same time, and bang , Ling Han was struck flying over a hundred miles away.

F***, he was merely trying to stop the fight, so why did he have to suffer this absurd disaster?

“Come, let me take a look at your abilities.”

“Gegege, that is precisely my intention!”

The two women once again rose up into the air, and began a furious battle.

It looked like these two women had not completely lost their wits, and still knew to avoid damaging the Imperial Capital below them. However, from the first moment, they were completely showing off their ultimate moves, and engaged in an extremely ferocious battle in midair.

“Blood Devours World!”

“Eight Lunar Techniques!”

In the exchange of blows between the two women, they were instantly shooting out powerful moves, making for an incredibly terrifying display.

Ling Han was awed. This was the real battle prowess of the Shattering Void Tier. In comparison, the Beast Snake King was practically a kid.

“Both their battle prowess should be about fifteen Stars, just about the same with the Fifteen-eyed Corpse King and the giant silver spider. There is obviously only a gap of three Stars of battle prowess, but they are so much stronger than the Beast Snake King! I really can’t imagine how terrifying that old dragon, with twenty Stars of battle prowess, would be!” Ling Han mumbled.

However, since there could appear one person with twenty Stars of battle prowess, why couldn’t there appear a second or a third? Who knew whether the five sects had sealed away this kind of elites or not.

Hopefully not.

After fighting for a while, the air suddenly became silent. The Lunar King and Yi Shuang Shuang both descended. There were a few rips and tears in their clothes, revealing their snow-white skin. One could even get a glimpse of the erotic beauty hidden inside.

However, the two women also immediately drew out a cloak from their spatial Spirit Tools each, so Ling Han could no longer have an eyeful.

“If I could use my full abilities, a single finger would be enough to crush you!” Yi Shuang Shuang’s anger had still not abated.

Yet the Lunar King smiled, and said, “You are indeed from the Immortal Realm! However, with the restriction of the realm, you only have fifteen Stars of battle prowess, which means that you had only reached fifteen Stars before you broke through in the past, and that’s not stronger than me.”

Ling Han was confused, and interrupted, “Should it not be that descended Immortals have twenty Stars of battle prowess?”

Yi Shuang Shuang shook her head, and said, “The restrictions of the realm are not calculated so simply. In truth, the maximum limit this realm can accommodate is the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, but whatever battle prowess you can reach at the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier would depend on your own talent.”

Ling Han finally understood, and said, “So it’s that your cultivation level has been suppressed to the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, and not that your battle prowess is suppressed to twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier.”

There was a big difference between the two. For example, both Helian Rong and Wenren Jie were in the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, but one only had ten Stars of battle prowess, and the other eleven. If the both them had a duel to death, Helian Rong would be very quickly killed by Wenren Jie. He would not even be qualified to take Wenren Jie down with him.

That was precisely the reason why even descended Immortals could not suppress Helian Tianyun those years ago. That old dragon had reached a battle prowess of twenty Stars of Shattering Void Tier at the time, and that was indeed enough to sweep aside all opposition in this realm.

“Oh, right, Lunar King, with the war so tense in the middle state, why have you come here?” Ling Han hurriedly changed the topic, not wanting these two women to begin bickering or even get into a fight again.

“Oh, the five sects? They have already lost once to us before, and nothing will change the second time,” the Lunar King said very loftily, “We heard you’ve established your nation, so with a suggestion of His Majesty, I came to help you train your armies.”

“That would really be great.” Ling Han was pleasantly surprised. He had only secretly learnt a few tricks of training soldiers from the Purple Moon Empire, but it was far from claiming to be skilled.

“Gegege, then how are you planning to repay me, Little Brother?” The Lunar King smiled flirtatiously and gracefully.

“You’re not allowed to have designs on Ling Han!” Hu Niu immediately stepped out in front of Ling Han, stretching out her arms widely, looking like she was protecting her food.

The Lunar King instantly laughed raucously. She shook and swayed in her laughter, displaying her shapely figure in full view, causing both Hu Niu and Yi Shuang Shuang to inwardly call her big vixen at the same time.

The big vixen would not be staying for long. She had brought with her a hundred-person army, and they were all elites amongst elites. Not only were they skilled in training soldiers, their personal abilities were also very powerful, and they were enough to help the Great Ling Empire conquer both the east and south regions.

Thus, the Lunar King invited Ling Han to head to the middle state. The war with the five sects was soon to begin, and even Ma Duo Bao might move in person.
