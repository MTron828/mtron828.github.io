Chapter 2238: Competition

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Originally, this great beast could have become the ruler of this world. It had been doted on by the heavens, and its strength had even surpassed the Regulations. If it had been given a little bit more time to grow, then even the Regulations could not have possibly harmed it.

Yet now, it was forced to battle ahead of time, and the result was that it could only die in despair, so it was naturally filled with dissatisfaction.

But at this moment, not one person dared to approach.

Who knew if this great beast still had a breath of life in it? This kind of existence was too terrifying, and even if it was a Fifth Secret monarch tier that approached, they would only be insta-killed.

The heavenly tribulation began to rapidly disperse. Not only did the dark clouds in the skies disappear, even that ocean of flames was rapidly dying out, and a massive deep abyss had been left in its place, its depths unfathomable.

“Move!”

Ling Han and the Rain Emperor darted out at the same time, one charging towards the deep pit, while the other charged towards the great beast.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?It was not just them. Everyone in the surrounding proximity was like a shark that had smelt blood, all shooting out towards that great beast, and wanting to take their own share of the loot.

“Scram, I am descended from Celestial King Zhang. Do you dare contend with me?”

“Ptui, I am the seventh generation grandson of the Enlightened Heaven Celestial King; who do you think you are!”

“We of the Chang Clan announce that this great beast is ours now.”

“…”

As they fought, they called out loudly, all attempting to use their background to scare off the others so they could monopolize the profits.

But there were really too many Celestial Kings in Clear Heaven Pass. Merely Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings numbered in the dozens, and there were naturally even more Celestial Kings below that grade. Who could be able to scare off the others?

Even if there were differences in level among Celestial Kings, who would care in such a chaotic situation? They were all attacking madly.

Ling Han ignored them. He was sure that with the strength of the Rain Emperor, Hu Niu, and the others, even if they could not monopolize this great beast entirely, they would be able to take a great share of the loot at the very least.

He streaked through the deep abyss, trying his best to recall the spot that the great beast had emerged from.

“It’s right here!”

Very soon, he located a spot because in this relatively flat bottom of the pit, there was actually another massive deep pit with indiscernible depths. Of course, compared to this “ocean,” this pit was much smaller. Its diameter was around several thousands of meters.

Judging by the size, it very much matched the size of that great beast.

Without hesitation, Ling Han leaped into the pit.

At first, it was complete darkness here, but he soon glimpsed light.

Those were actually stars!

This heaven and earth was developing its own world, just like this realm that they were in, where there existed the Ancient Realm and the Celestial Realm. It was also the same here. Another level was presently being developed inside, filled with stars, the sun, and moon hanging in the skies.

In this place, Ling Han discovered that he was incredibly powerful. He could destroy a star with a single breath.

This was not a misconception, but that was indeed the case.

…If he returned to the Ancient Realm, he could easily destroy a star just by stretching out his hand. However, the heaven and earth had their own rules. He was too strong, and if he went to the Ancient Realm, he would definitely be under severe restrictions, his battle prowess suppressed to the extent that would be allowed by the Ancient Realm. Otherwise, he would definitely be expelled by the heaven and earth back to the Celestial Realm, or be crushed and die there. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Ancient Realm was only weak in Regulations, but the heaven and earth was still the heaven and earth, and even a Heavenly Venerate could not possibly stand against the heaven and earth.

Ling Han traversed through the pit. This place did not seem like the place that the great beast had resided in, and what was more important was that what he had first glimpsed was clearly an eye, and definitely did not look anything like that great beast.

The feeling that this eye gave him was too extraordinary, so what Ling Han was truly searching for was that eye.

“En?” He faltered slightly because he sensed a frightening aura surge from behind him. Someone was rapidly approaching, and it was not just one person at that.

Ling Han stopped, turned around, and looked behind him.

A young man was presently flying rapidly, and there were a few more people running on air behind him.

“Scram!” As the young man came close, he stretched out a hand to grab Ling Han.?Boom, his Origin Power formed a terrifying gigantic hand. Wherever he passed, the stars would all be instantly destroyed.

These stars had just been formed, and were very fragile in the first place, so how could they possibly match the might of a Fifth Secret Immortal Palace Tier?

Ling Han frowned slightly. Previously, he had already exhausted his stores of Dragon Qi completely to stand against the sound wave blasted out by that great beast. Now, it was naturally impossible that he would have any more strength to face the attack of a Fifth Secret monarch tier head-on.

However, this man was really too harsh. If anyone was to say the word “scram,” it should be Ling Han who would have that right as the first person who had discovered this place.

How domineering.

Ling Han humphed, and used Void Space. He formed thousands of copies of himself, and easily dodged this blow.

“En?” That young man showed a hint of surprise as his advance came to an abrupt halt. His eyes glowed brightly, focused on Ling Han. “To be able to dodge the strike of me, Meng Feicheng, you are not too ordinary.”

He crossed his hands behind him, and declared, “Not too bad. I will give you a chance to become my dog!”

As the personal disciple of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he did have the right to be arrogant.

Ling Han had not made any reply, and the third wave of people had already arrived. This was a group of nine young people, who practically looked the same. Their attire was also identical, and no one would be able to distinguish one from the rest.

“Oh, so it is Brother Meng!” the nine people spoke at the same time. It was clearly nine men that were speaking, yet just by the sound alone, it was as if it was a single person that had spoken, which was extremely bizarre.

Meng Feicheng turned around to take a look, and his gaze flickered slightly. However, he revealed nothing in his expression as he asked, “The Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan? Hehe, this is already my territory, so please give me some face, and leave here.”

The Chang Clan was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. The Encompassing Age Celestial King was not the slightest bit inferior to his own master, so he naturally dared not act too arrogant. Furthermore, the Chang Clan was blessed by the heavens. Not only had all seven sons of the Encompassing Age Celestial King become Celestial Kings, these Nine Tigers were also birthed by the same mother, from the same womb. Though they only had the aptitude of an emperor tier, the nine of them were connected mentally, and they could match a monarch tier together.

Hence, these nine people were his strong opponents.

“Hehe, we have been hoping to ask Brother Meng to show us some face, and hand this place over to us,” the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan all said, the nine of them speaking like one.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile slightly. If Hu Niu was here, she would definitely be extremely curious.

…Do you guys eat together? Do you guys also use the toilet together?

…Do you each marry one wife, or share one among yourselves?

…Then, what about the consummation of marriage? Would the other eight just be standing by and watching?

Meng Feicheng’s expression darkened, and he said, “I have promised my master to deliver a precious gift to him. Do you all wish to force me to return empty-handed?”

The Nine Tigers of Chang Clan also smirked coldly. “We have also been commanded by our ancestors to take control of this neutral zone, and cannot allow anyone to even take a single grass or tree, so we fear that Brother Meng’s wish cannot be fulfilled.”

“So we can only settle it through battle then?” Meng Feicheng asked calmly. Under normal circumstances, he naturally would not fear the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan, but in this place, power of Regulation was limited. He feared that he would encounter a strong opponent even after defeating the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan. If that happened, it was possible that he would be no match.

Of course, this powerful opponent did not include Ling Han. He was a mere First Secret, and even if he was a monarch tier, Meng Feicheng would be able to suppress the former easily with a single move.

“Let’s battle!” the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan all exclaimed loudly, emanating a blazing fighting spirit.

Meng Feicheng did not make a move, but rather looked into the distance. “However, we, too, cannot pave the way for someone else’s success.”

The Nine Tigers of Chang Clan all looked over as well.

“Brother Liu, how long are you going to stay hidden?” Meng Feicheng asked calmly..
