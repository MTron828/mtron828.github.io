Chapter 1732: Source Water

Ling Han did not continue just being on the brunt of the beating. He channeled the Nine Heavens Flame, and boom, the fiery flames burned the skies.

That first severance grand elder immediately stepped back. He had a feeling if this flame touched him even in the slightest, he would be burned to nothing. He only stopped when he had retreated more than 300 meters away, his eyes fixed on that flame, and his expression changing swiftly.

He steadied his mind, and upon a closer look, he realized that he had made a big fuss over a minor issue. This flame was indeed very frightening, but it was practically impossible that it would be able to penetrate his defenses.

So strange: it gave him a feeling of lingering fear, but the fact was that it was not very strong, either.

Suddenly, a thought flashed in his mind, and an idea that he did not dare believe emerged.

Ancestral flame!

According to legend, there were a total of nine types of ancestral flames in the Celestial Realm, and they were the source of all flames. They could also be considered as the most direct manifestation of Fire Regulations. Someone had once foretold that if one managed to obtain all the nine ancestral flames, they would be able to successfully attain the strongest Fire Regulations, and place above all the Kings.

Could it be that this was one of the ancestral flames? Otherwise, the other party was only in Genesis Tier, so why did he feel a wariness that he would die if he was touched by this fire?

This brat... had been blessed with divine luck, and actually refined an ancestral flame!

That first severance grand elder’s eyes turned bloodshot from envy. Not even a Celestial King could absolutely and with complete certainty encounter such an ultimate treasure, yet it was now possessed by a mere Genesis Tier.

He was going to take this fated opportunity for his own.

“Hahahaha, this is mine!” That first severance grand elder grabbed out at Ling Han, Regulations entwined around his hands. This would be enough to resist the Nine Heavens Flame.

Ling Han sighed. Any second severance grand elders that would come here would have just barely passed the ordeal during the first severance—aside from Bei Xuanming. But even so, this king among kings of Genesis Tier like him would still be completely incapable of matching such a Severing Mundane Tier ancestor that was so weak.

The difference between Immortal level and Celestial level was really colossal. No wonder so many people were filled with confidence, and thought that no matter how wide the difference in power they had with others at present, they only had to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier, and it would be equivalent to having begun from the same starting line.

“Haha, we’ll stop here today, and when we meet next, I’ll take your wretched head then!” Ling Han threw out the wooden raft and left with the Empress, leaving a first severance grand elder roaring in fury behind them.

There was nothing that could be done. Great dao was rippling in the river waters, and perhaps only a Celestial King would be capable of crossing the river by force.

“We have to reach Severing Mundane Tier as soon as possible,” Ling Han said solemnly.

The Empress nodded earnestly. Even though they were presently invincible amongst Genesis Tiers, they would be helpless if they met a first severance grand elder, and this was really very displeasing to them.

The river flow was very quick, but there weren’t many splashing waves. It was so calm that it was slightly frightening. If one looked closely at the river waters, one would discover that there were patterns of great dao rippling amidst the water. Too bad, this river water could not be consumed. Otherwise, for cultivators that cultivated Water Regulations, this would be a precious treasure.

There were no living creatures in the waters. This was very normal. If anything could actually survive in this kind of river water, then this kind of living creature would have to be of the level of Celestial King Tier, which would be terrifying.

“Go to the source of the river,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

After entering into the Celestial Realm, it was as if Small Tower had become invisible, and basically ignored Ling Han completely. According to its words, the Celestial Realm was abundant with Spiritual Qi, and was of great help to its “recovery”, so it could not be bothered to give any regard to Ling Han.

He had not thought that it would actually speak up of its own volition at this moment.

Ling Han mentally said, “There is definitely no good news everytime you speak up! Is it that you have discovered something that is beneficial for your recovery here?”

Small Tower sneered, and said, “I suspect that there is Source Water of the heaven and earth here, and initially planned to help you attain it, but since you’re saying this, then I can’t be bothered to be a busybody, either.”

“Wait, wait, what is Source Water of heaven and earth?” Ling Han asked hurriedly.

“Since the heaven and earth have born the Nine Great Ancestral Flames, then why wouldn’t there be Mother Water that is of the same level?” Small Tower said evenly, and then made no further comment after.

Ancestral flame, Source Water, the same level!

Ling Han inhaled sharply, and asked, “Can I also refine it so that it would become my Source Power?”

“Theoretically, yes,” Small Tower said. “However, at present, I have no desire to help you get the Source Water of heaven and earth at all, so that is now completely impossible.”

F***, this proud Tower, hadn’t he just teased it a little?

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Stop playing around and be serious.”

Small Tower gave a few humphs, and finally said, “It is highly possible that this river is formed from the Source Water of heaven and earth, so if you trace down its source, you should be able to discover the presence of the Source Water.”

“How should I collect it?” Ling Han asked. “This river water cannot be touched at all, the slightest contact would mean death.”

“Without my guidance, you are naturally going to end up dead, but with my presence, everything would be different,” Small Tower declared proudly, but did not continue speaking. Clearly, it was holding a grudge.

“...Good Small Tower, my words just now were too harsh just now.” Ling Han could only surrender. If it was an enemy, he could still defeat him, but the proud Tower was in his body, and he was completely helpless against it.

Small Tower put on airs for a while longer, and then continued, “In truth, it is very simple. You have refined the Nine Heavens Flame as your life force, so you only need to wrap yourself in Nine Heavens Flame, and you will be able to guarantee that you will not be injured by the Source Water.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Will that work?” Ling Han was doubtful. The Nine Heavens Flame hadn’t even reached Severing Mundane Tier, so how was it supposed to resist this kind of Source Water?

“Stupid, I’m not asking you to directly resist the Source Water. This is only a sliver of aura that has seeped out from the Source Water. If the Nine Heavens Flame could not resist even this, then what right does it have to be called one of the Ancestral flames?” Small Tower asked in disapproval.

“But I still have to sever my mortal bonds, and if I veer off my original course...” Ling Han was hesitant. If he missed this opportunity of breaking through to the Severing Mundane Tier, he would have to wait for another 10,000,000 years, or would have to look again for a different location to sever his mortal bonds.

But if he would also have to wait 10,000,000 years, he would definitely choose to first break through to the Severing Mundane Tier, and come back in future to collect the Source Water.

“Sigh, how did I get such a stupid master like you?” Small Tower sighed in despair. “The whole Mystery Realm should be formed by the Source Water of heaven and earth, so if you could gain the Source Water, that would be equivalent to severing your mortal bonds in a location where the power of heaven and earth is most abundant, and that is still not enough?”

Ling Han was immediately relieved. This was great; it would not delay either matter.

The Nine Heavens Flame was already incredibly awesome, so if he could gain a Source Water of heaven and earth and make it into his own Source Power, what kind of impressive extent would his battle prowess reach?

He related this matter to the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Both women naturally agreed that he should go and collect the Source Water. In any case, the Empress could enter into the Black Tower, come back out when they arrived where the Source Water was, and break through into the Severing Mundane Tier there.

Ling Han sent out multiple palm strikes, pushing the wooden raft forwards. On the way, he had also caught up with a great many people. He saw that a great battle broke out between some wooden rafts when they encountered one another. The people on board only had to be blasted into the water, and they would definitely be done for.

They journeyed for another stretch, and he discovered Mao Shuyu and Zhang Chong to his surprise. Thus, he followed behind the two of them.

This decision of his was very correct because these two people encountered quite a number of waves of attacks, and in the last wave, they were not able to resolve the attack. It was Ling Han who moved and helped them resolve their crisis.

Mao Shuyu’s eyes were sharp, and she recognized Ling Han. Zhang Chong, meanwhile, was embarrassed. When he thought of his previous attitude towards Ling Han, and how now the latter helped him, taking no account of their former enmity, this made him feel quite apologetic.

Thus, Ling Han accompanied them on the journey. Two days later, they went ashore. From here, they could head towards the final location for Severing Mundane Tier, but it was also the most dangerous place in the Severing Mundane Pool: the Cave of Death.
