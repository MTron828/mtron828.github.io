Chapter 2137: Partiality

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Long Yuexi had died.

A Celestial King of her generation, a Ninth Heaven overlord, practically the strongest existence in the Celestial Realm, someone who had endured countless epochs, and borne witness to changes over the ages, had still finally died and returned to dust.

If it were not for the fact that she could not let it go, she should have died long ago, several epochs ago.

“Grand Elder!” The members of the Roc Palace all wept. Even Elder Fuyun showed a hint of grief in her expression.

She had sided with the Four Seas Palace because she was incredibly realistic. However, it did not mean that her heart was already leaning in favor of the Four Seas Palace.

“Long live the Imperial Empress!” The members of the Four Seas Palace, meanwhile, were all excited. With Long Yuexi’s death, the Roc Palace was finally conquered.

Shang Zhiwei did not feel any kind of happiness. Instead, she showed a disappointed and frustrated expression. Perhaps it was Long Yuexi’s final words that pierced her heart.

Long ago, several epochs ago, she had already lost, lost to Tianyun, and it was a complete, absolute loss at that.

Tianyun and Yuan Sheng had both long since died, and now Long Yuexi had also died. So what if Shang Zhiwei was the one to have the last laugh? When the flames of her vengeance were calmed, what meaning would there be left to her life?

“After I kill Tianyun’s reincarnation, and settle the matters of the Palace, I will go to the doorway of darkness, and battle with those elites from the Foreign Realm right until I bleed the last drop of my blood,” she murmured. “Pacifying the storm of darkness, this was Yuan Sheng’s strongest wish. Though I cannot realize it on his behalf, I will definitely try my best.

“Long Yuexi, though you have been my lifelong enemy, any crimes would be cleared with death. Taking into consideration the fact that you, too, are a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, I shall offer you a funeral!” she declared loudly. WIth a wave of her hand,?boom, the indestructible Roc Mountains were forcibly torn apart, as if they were merely a painting being unfurled.

With another wave of her hand, she delivered Long Yuexi’s body into the mountain range that was torn open. Then, with her clapping her hands together, the mountains immediately returned to their original state, as if nothing had happened previously at all.

This was the strength of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Others would only manage to bump a few rocks off after fighting for so long, but she could easily cause damage.

“Enough!” she spoke up again, filled with dominance.

“Greetings, Imperial Empress!” The Spiritual Mountain Celestial King descended, half-kneeling in front of her, and appearing incredibly reverent, but the lowered gave held a very strong adoration.

He has always loved Shang Zhiwei, and the fact that he was willing to stay as a number two in the Four Seas Palace was also because of this.

However, he had never dared to confess his feelings, fearing that after he was rejected, Shang Zhiwei would expel him from the Four Seas Palace.

Xiao Gu had his own principles when he was mimicking and impersonating. Though he saw how the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had half-knelt, he did not kneel down alongside him, but rather went off in a daze on the sidelines.

“So it’s Old Bone Demon!” Shang Zhiwei looked at Xiao Gu. “It was rumored that you had already died several epochs ago, and it looks like the rumors were not false. The consciousness that was born from the Celestial Bone has already died out, and the intelligence of this newly born one is no more than that of a three-year-old.” She had excellent insight, and could tell Xiao Gu’s origins with a single glance.

“So it’s Old Bone Demon…” Xiao Gu was very interested, and began mimicking her words.

Shang Zhiwei did not take offense. Her gaze turned to Ling Han, a complex expression appearing on her face. After a long while, she finally said, “You are Yuan Sheng’s disciple, and that would make you my disciple, my child.”

When these words were spoken, a storm of protest rose among the members of the Four Seas Palace.

A disciple was one thing as Shang Zhiwei had a total of three personal disciples. But a child?

Shang Zhiwei had never married, so it was naturally impossible that she would have any children. In that case, what kind of privileges would Ling Han have? Becoming the Young Imperial Emperor of Four Seas Palace?

Though everyone was unwilling to accept this, no one dared to say anything. They could only feel envy.

The Four Seas Palace had always been ruled by Shang Zhiwei’s word alone. This was also the privilege due to a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the high and lofty status of a divinity.

“You are Yuan Sheng’s disciple…” Xiao Gu was also mimicking from the side, copying Shang Zhiwei’s expression and actions completely, and causing Ling Han to involuntarily feel gloomy. ‘You f***** actually want to become my father as well?’

“Hand over Tianyun’s reincarnation.” Shang Zhiwei looked at Ling Han, her eyes holding benevolence. She was really treating Ling Han like her own child.

“Hand over Tianyun’s…” Xiao Gu repeated.

Ling Han pretended to be puzzled, and asked, “What Tianyun’s reincarnation?”

“Tianyun’s reincarnation has definitely not left the Roc Heaven, and she is not in anyone’s Spatial God Tool, either. Then there is only one possibility, and that is she is inside the… that Yuan Sheng forged,” Spatial God Tool stated calmly. However, she deliberately skipped over the name of the Tower of Three Realms. It seemed like she knew that the effects of this name were overwhelming.

Xiao Gu still copied, completely shamelessly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Han was inwardly stunned. Shang Zhiwei had only done a sweep with her divine sense, and she had already scanned over every single person’s Spatial God Tool?

As expected of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, she was too strong.

However, there was absolutely no way that he would hand Hu Niu over. Thus, he said, “Aunt Wei, Senior Tianyun has long since died. The Hu Niu now is only Hu Niu. She only possesses the martial imprint of Senior Tianyun, yet is a completely independent personality. She is only a junior of yours, so why should you lower yourself to her level?”

To play the fool with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was clearly a very stupid thing to do.

However, Ling Han was truly shameless, and had even directly addressed her as “Aunt Wei”, causing the members of the Four Seas Palace to exclaim at his shamelessness. He was really too quick to go along with her lead.

However, this address of ‘Aunt Wei’ made Shang Zhiwei feel elated. If she had been able to lay down her love for Yuan Sheng, she would not have possibly targeted the Roc Palace for so many years. As the saying went, the stronger the love, the stronger the hate that would result. What made her most despondent was the fact that she had never gotten any recognition. However, when Ling Han addressed her as Aunt Wei, it was equivalent to giving her status on behalf of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

To Shang Zhiwei, what could be more important than that?

Involuntarily, she smiled, and said, “You have a really sweet tongue, child.”

“You have a really…” Xiao Gu copied her words earnestly and tirelessly.

“However, as long as it is related to Tianyun, then it has to be destroyed. I cannot allow any sliver of her to remain in this world!” Shang Zhiwei declared decisively. Her hatred towards Tianyun was not something that could be resolved by just the words “Aunt Wei”.

“Aunt Wei, it is easy to make enemies, but hard to resolve grudges. It would be better that you just let it go,” Ling Han advised from the sidelines.

Shang Zhiwei’s eyes blazed. “You are merely besotted by that little girl’s beauty. It is not true love! I have a disciple who is as beautiful as a celestial maiden. She is definitely in no way inferior to that little girl. Her temperament is gentle, and she has excellent natural talent in cultivation. I will make the decision and betroth her to you. She would be a truly good match for you.”

Hearing these words, the members of the Four Seas Palace were all dumbfounded.

Shang Zhiwei had a total of three disciples, but only one of them was female. Thus, she had to be speaking of Holy Daughter An Ran.

True, Holy Daughter An Ran was extraordinarily talented in cultivation, and practically looked like she would become the second Shang Zhiwei. Furthermore, she was also as beautiful as a celestial maiden. She was a truly exquisite beauty, but to say that she had a gentle temperament?

Everyone shook their heads in unison, filled with disbelief. Holy Daughter An Ran definitely had absolutely no relation with these words.

This woman was incredibly proud, just like a peacock spreading its tail feathers. To say nothing of peers, even in Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier, there were not many that she truly paid any regard to.

If she knew that Shang Zhiwei wanted to marry her off to Ling Han, she would probably explode.

Furthermore, just how much did Shang Zhiwei dote on Ling Han?

Shang Zhiwei had always considered Holy Daughter An Ran as her own daughter, yet now she was easily betrothing her hand to another like this. She did not even bother to ask, so it was clear just how partial she was to Ling Han, right?

This was very much to be envied!

The members of the Four Seas Palace all looked at Ling Han, and even a great many Celestial Kings were no exception.
