Chapter 3593: Descending from the heavens…

Translator: Henyee Translations I Editor: Henyee Translations

Little Loli

Niu Jianhua was really petty, to actually block him at the entrance of the Primordial Sect.

Aren’t you afraid of angering the Primordial Sect and that they would dispatch elites to eliminate you?

Lmg Han turned around to take a look. This place was already outside the territory of the Primordial Sect, and the four old men had not done anything either. It was because of this that no trouble had been drawn out.

Old b@stards, when I have advanced into Celestial Path, let’s see who would be able to thrash whom.

Ling Han didn’t feel safe, and after leaving far away, he took out the Void Beast hide and wrapped it around himself. Then, he left the main path.

He had just entered into the forest, and xiu, xiu, xiu, five figures arrived through the air.

Niu Jianhua and his four old servants.

Hold on, one, two, three, four, five Celestial Path elites?

Ling Han was surprised. Niu Jianhua had actually reached the Foundation Building Tier?

Thinking about it, it made sense. He had missed out on the Ethereal Peak, and ad not obtained the Star Origin Fruit either. What was the point of delaying his breaking through to Celestial Path any further then?

“Wang Quan, how many times have I said that I would rather kill the wrong person than let him go!” Niu Jianhua said balefully, “Since you think that person’s back looks very much like that evil thief, you should detain him! Could it be that you don’t know that there is a disguise technique that can change a person’s appearance?”

Wang Quan was the old man who had stopped Ling Han previously. Now he could only reluctantly agree. Who asked him to let Ling Han go?

Thankfully, he was only suspicious now. If he was sure that the one he had let go was “Can Ye”, Niu Jianhua would probably want to chop his heart into pieces.

“He’s only a mortal, and he can’t have run far. Find him!” Niu Jianhua continued.

“Yes, Young Master.” The four old men all dashed out.

F***, wasn’t it just smashing you with a stone slab? Was there any need to bear a grudge?

Ling Han lamented internally. If Niu Jianhua and Jianhua was still a Mystery Realm Tier, he would be able to sneak over and deliver another strike, but a Celestial Path elite… hehe, probably when Ling Han was within thirty meters of him, the latter would be able to see through him, and then it would be him delivering himself right up to his doorstep.

He would remember this enmity.

Ling Han turned around and left quietly.

After wearing the hide of the Void Beast, Ling Han’s speed was naturally not very fast. In a single night, he had only travelled a few hundred km After daybreak, he first cultivated, then continued his journey with the hide of the Void Beast wrapped around him.

The Primordial True Lord should soon discover that the Spirit Diagram had een stolen, and “Can Ye” had disappeared. He would definitely send elites to hunt him down.

Though he had already changed his appearance, it was still best to be careful. After all, his original appearance was definitely also on the wanted list of the Primordial Sect.

He set out towards the Imperial Capital, but because he was wrapped in the hide of the Void Beast, his speed could not be fast, but that was all right He only had to travel a little further, and confirm that it was safe, and he would be able to continue his journey at full speed.

The day passed, and at night, Ling Han did not continue his journey Instead he wrapped himself in the hide of the Void Beast and planned to take a nap ’ After he had finished cultivating, he would continue his journey with all his might.

Xiu, a shooting star appeared above Ling Han’s head.

‘It can’t be so coincidental, right?’

Ling Han mocked internally. However, he soon revealed an expression of shock, because this shooting star was really crashing directly towards him.

‘F*ckyou!’

Ling Han hurriedly used the Imminent Skyline. Peng, peng, peng! This was a forest, and there were trees everywhere. Ling Han instantly burst out at a terrifying speed, breaking through who knew how many trees along the way before finally stopping. However, looking at the distance, he had only travelled over 5km away.

Thankfully, there were trees along the way, and with the toughness of Ling

Han’s present physique, he could still bear this kind of impact.

Yi?

Ling Han looked surprised. The meteor had clearly fallen to the ground, but why was there no movement at all?

Had it been eaten by a dog?

He was curious, and hurriedly rushed back. The over 5km route was naturally a matter of the blink of an eye.

Returning to the vicinity of the original spot, Ling Han leaped up a large tree and looked down. Involuntarily, he gaped.

That wasn’t a shooting star, but rather a shuttle. It was completely silver in color, and its perfectly streamlined shape was filled with supreme beauty. What kind of physique did he have? Why did things that fell from the skies, whether they were meteorites or shuttles, all like to crash onto him?

Ling Han reflected on his own actions. Could it be that it was because he had repeatedly broken the limits of heaven and earth, and that was why the heaven and earth was jealous of him, and wanted to use this kind of method to erase him?

Right at this moment, the shuttle’s hatch opened, and a person jumped out. Then, this person was gone.

It was not that he had suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth but rather that this person was too small, and had been blocked from sight by the shuttle.

Xiu, the shuttle had disappeared.

It had truly vanished from the face of the earth, as if it had never existed in the first place.

And where it stood, there was a silver-haired little lolita that looked to be only six or seven years old. Her face was incredibly delicate, and her eyes were wide, filled with innocence and… mischief.

Strange, how could these two completely different traits appear on the same person?

“Yiyaya, how did the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth in this world recover?” The little loli’s expression was filled with confusion, “Didn’t Grandpa say that this would take at least another thousand years?”

“I have deliberately chosen myself, to establish a large kingdom, and then fill the palace with handsome men, feeding me snacks every day… won’t this small wish be realized?”

“Could it be that I, the Demon King, have flown to the wrong place? Isn’t this the Celestial Sea Planet?”

“Or has Grandpa been lying to me all this while?”

“En, this old geezer always lies to kids, unreliable!”

The silver-haired little lolita bit on a finger, and seemed to be thinking After a while, she clapped her hands, “I’ll find someone to ask first.”

She took out a Clairvoyant, picked it up and examined it. Very quickly, the Clairvoyant’s line of vision met Ling Han.

No way, she could even spot him like this?

“Native!” the silver-haired little lolita shouted at Ling Han.

He had really been discovered.

AS Ling Han leaped down from the tree, he thought, ‘What kind of treasure is this Clairvoyance? It can actually see through the disguise of the Void Beast hide.’

“Yi, so it’s a handsome big brother!” The silver-haired little lolita’s eyes lit up, “Handsome Brother, want to eat toffee?”

Sure enough, she took out a piece of candy and waved it around.

Lmg Han couldn’t help but feel awkward. ‘Are you trying to use sugar to court me?’

He immediately realized that this little loli was a problematic child.

“Sure,” he said with a smile.

Yet the silver-haired little lolita withdrew her hand, “Then you can’t eat for nothing. In future, you have to carry me, feed me, and coax me to sleep.” Tsk, there were really a lot of conditions.

Ling Han laughed, “You want to bribe me with a piece of candy? No, I am not that kind of casual person.”

The silver-haired little lolita became anxious, and said, “This candy of mine is very delicious. I used Golden Cloud Cow Milk as the raw ingredients, and added With the Spring of Eternal Spirit and the Heavenly Mist Lotus Fruit, combined with one hundred and eight supplementary ingredients.”

Ling Han was surprised. When the Golden Cloud Cow matured, it was a True Self Tier existence. Being able to milk it, what kind of noble clan did the little loli come from?

-Here, I’ll give you a piece of meat. Want to trade?” He took out a piece of dried meat from his Spatial Spirit Tool.

“Hehe.” The silver-haired little lolita put on a fake smile, and even rolled her eyes at him.

F***, are you really only six or seven years old?

Ling Han spread out his hands, “If you don’t want to trade, then forget it
