Chapter 369: Battling Again

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

All of them were excited. Though none of them had experienced it first-hand, they had heard from Ling Han that he had been pursued by Duan Zheng Zhi all these days. All of them felt ire at that, and now that the Boiling Blood Pill was successfully concocted, they could finally raise the flag for their counterattack. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han exited the city and headed south. However, he had only travelled about a hundred miles when Duan Zheng Zhi appeared once again as if he was a tapeworm.

“Brat, let’s see where you’ll run off to this time!” Duan Zheng Zhi sneered. Previously, Ling Han did not use the “instant movement talisman” but rather chose to take the risk and compete with him in speed to escape into the city; what did that imply?

He no longer had any instant movement talismans left—or he only had one or two left, which he had to save for a time when he needed it to save his life.

“However, I am quite impressed. You obviously have no more means to preserve your life, yet you still dare to leave the city alone!” he continued. He was trying to probe Ling Han’s words now; he wanted to know if Ling Han still had any instant movement talismans in his possession.

Ling Han smiled calmly and said, “Who said that I left the city alone?”

“Oh, could it be that you’ve hired an elite martial artists?” Duan Zheng Zhi was slightly alarmed. There was indeed no such idiot in this world who obviously knew that he was currently being hunted down by an elite in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier yet would still deliberately and boldly leave the city to go to his death.

However, when he expanded his divine sense, he did not detect that there was anyone lying in ambush in their proximity.

In truth, he had followed Ling Han for a long while before he finally appeared in front of him. Firstly, now that they had travelled far enough, it was impossible for Ling Han to escape back into the city, and secondly, he had to confirm that there were no elite martial artist following behind Ling Han to protect him.

How was it possible that he would appear if he was not completely sure?

Ling Han smiled slightly, and raised his right hand slightly. Hu Niu’s figure appeared out of nowhere and immediately stretched out her small arms to hug him, looking completely like she was planning to keep clinging to him.

Duan Zheng Zhi’s mouth instantly opened in a gape, his eyeballs looking like they were about to pop out of his head.

How could this be possible!?

A living person appeared out of thin air? Could it be that this little girl had appeared by using the instant movement talisman? But did this world have this kind of instant movement talisman that would actually allow one to appear in such an exact location?

Duan Zheng Zhi suddenly had a sense of foreboding. When one encountered something that he could not logically explain, he would definitely experience a feeling of helplessness.

“Niu Niu, thrash him!” Ling Han said with a smile.

“En!” Hu Niu answered decisively. Her tiny figure twisted, and xiu , like a bolt of lightning, instantly appeared behind Duan Zheng Zhi. She raised her tiny fist, aiming a punch on the back of Duan Zheng Zhi’s head.

Her speed was really much too fast, so fast that Duan Zheng Zhi did not even have the time to dodge nor parry. All he could do was use Origin Power to protect his head and circulate his martial intent to form a shield.

To clash head-on with an opponent in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier with the ability of the Spiritual Ocean Tier... the only result would be that Hu Niu’s fist would be completely shattered.

But how could Hu Niu be so easily dealt with?

Her tiny fist changed direction inconceivably and pounded right below. Peng , it hit Duan Zheng Zhi’s back directly, and this one punch was enough to make Duan Zheng Zhi stumble so that he almost collapsed onto the ground.

Hu Niu succeeded in this first attack and immediately displayed her beastlike style of attack. Peng, peng, peng. Her tiny fists waved repetitively, endlessly assaulting Duan Zheng Zhi’s weak points.

Duan Zheng Zhi was astonished and could only expand his Origin Power without caring for the price to protect his entire body. It was as if he had become a porcupine, and there was no longer any area left for Hu Niu to attack. This finally forced Hu Niu to have no choice but to stop. With a xiu , she had leaped back to Ling Han’s side and once again clung to him, acting spoiled.

The Hu Niu now looked harmless, like a delicate, pretty little princess. Who would have thought that her attacks just now had been so wild and incisive!

Duan Zheng Zhi suddenly felt a powerful fear, because protecting his whole body with Origin Power like this was a very huge expense on his reserves, and about an hour at most in this condition would leave him powerless. Hu Niu needed only wait until the time when he appeared to be short of Origin Power to attack, and at that time, he would be... The results would be unthinkable!

Thankfully, he still had a secret weapon!

Duan Zheng Zhi drew out his imitation Demonic Noise Saber. This was a Level Five Spirit Tool, and furthermore, it was capable of releasing sound attacks from all directions. Hu Niu’s cultivation level of the Spiritual Ocean Tier was a solid weakness. With the demonic noise penetrating her brain, her only fate would be being slaughtered by him as he desired.

“Heng, you two are indeed a bit strange, but in front of absolute power, your only fate would be death!” he said coldly.

Ling Han laughed loudly and said, “Haven’t you seen how pathetic you looked just now!”

“Ugly guy!” Hu Niu exclaimed haughtily.

“How dare you!” Duan Zheng Zhi waved the Demonic Noise Saber, and immediately, sound waves spread out to attack Hu Niu and Ling Han.

“Big Brother Guang, it’s time for you to come out!” Ling Han waved his hand, and Guang Yuan’s figure appeared instantly. This guy curled his hand into a fist, and hong , four flashes of Fist Qi danced, all transforming into the image of five silver-colored dragons that charged towards the demonic sound waves.

Peng, peng, peng, peng . The five dragon images were shattered in the first instant, but the demonic sound wave was not diminished. It continued on its path and left a considerable number of wounds on Guang Yuan’s body before finally disappearing.

It was worthy of being called the imitation of a Level Ten Spirit Tool. It was far stronger than any other ordinary Level Five Spirit Tool.

Duan Zheng Zhi, meanwhile, looked astonished. He said, “You have actually broken through to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier? That’s not right, how could you possibly appear here all of a sudden?” If one person used an instant movement talisman to appear here, that could still be called a coincidence, but for two? How could such a thing be possible!

Moreover, how could instant movement talismans be wasted like that?

He came to a realization abruptly and exclaimed, “A Spatial Spirit Tool that can store living beings! You brat, you actually have such an extremely valuable treasure on you!” His expression turned heated. This was too shocking, because that was equivalent to having an army of his own wherever he went!

Just think, if he went alone and snuck into a major faction, then released a large number of elites from his Spatial Spirit Tool and suddenly mobilized them into a sneak attack... How shocking would be the results of such a battle?

Especially for the Thousand Corpse Sect. The thing that this party needed the most was a place of concealment where they could secretly develop. If he could obtain such a divine treasure, then who in this world would still be able to find the Thousand Corpse Sect?

“Hahahaha, even the gods are on my side!” He laughed loudly. If he could bring back this kind of divine treasure, then there would no longer be any need to mention his failure of destroying the branch at the Sea Breeze City. He would be rewarded greatly, and it might be even possible that he would be directly promoted to become the vice sect leader.

“Dream on.” Ling Han naturally knew what he was thinking. He shook his head and said, “Big Brother Guang, kill him!”

“All right!” Guang Yuan opened his hand and took a crimson red pill, which, of course, was the Boiling Blood Pill.

“Haha, so what if you have broken through to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier? You are only in the first layer, whereas I am in the third, and I also have the Demonic Noise Saber in hand! Killing you would be as easy as killing a chicken!” Duan Zheng Zhi said disdainfully.

To prevent any accidents from happening by having the battle drag on, he immediately took the initiative to charge over. He raised the saber in a flying slash and the offensive demonic noise surged forth, able to penetrate the brain and shatter the heart.

Guang Yuan roared in rage. Hong , a terrifying aura emanated in a wave from his body, and actually formed a hurricane around him. Martial intent was flickering within.

Peng , he shot out another punch, and as before, four flashes of Fist Qi which transformed into five dragon images appeared. Yet these five dragon images were at least ten times bigger than the previous five. Each was about thirty feet tall, and their silver color shone brilliantly.
