3080 Continually Changing Situation

Everyone was deeply astonished, including Ling Han.

This turn of events was truly unexpected. Hysteria had just reached the peak of its life, yet it had quickly fallen to rock bottom in the very next instant. Was it done for? Was it about to die? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Extermination, just who in the world are you?!” Hysteria roared using its divine sense. It discovered the perilous situation of its body, and it realized that it might explode at any moment.

It was using its full strength to stabilize its body, yet it was as if that destructive power were the ultimate will of heaven and earth. This was a will that didn’t heed his command.

Extermination clasped her hands behind her back, and explained calmly, “With life comes inevitable death. Separation begets union, and union begets separation. Do you know? Every world and every dimension has an upper limit regarding how much power it can contain. After engulfing so many realms, the power that you’ve absorbed has already surpassed this limit.

“So, even if I hadn’t targeted you, you would have still struggled to escape this fate of destruction.

“I simply accelerated the process.”

Hysteria was boiling with rage. If Extermination hadn’t used that so-called Origin Destroying Strike, would it have been forced into this perilous state?

If it were given enough time, it could have torn open the void using its absolute strength and jumped out of this small and restrictive pond!

Of course, Hysteria naturally didn’t know what lay beyond the void. Was it a more spectacular world, or was it an ice-cold and desolate land of nothingness?

Regardless, as long as it left this world, it would no longer have to suffer the restriction of this heaven and earth.

Now, however, was everything going to be destroyed by its past self?

‘Why? Why?! Why?!?!’

“Everyone, are you not going to hurry up and attack? We can’t allow it to unleash a dying attack and cause immense damage!” Extermination said as she looked at Ling Han and the others. To be more precise, she was specifically talking to Ling Han.

After all, no one else could cause any damage to Hysteria, even though it was already in such dire straits. Not only that, but a casual counter-attack from Hysteria could easily kill even Seventh Tier elites—the death of Extermination and Yellow Sand in the last era was proof of this fact.

The might of the Genesis World was unstoppable, and the invincibility of Seventh Tier elites was not absolute.

Thus, only Ling Han was powerful enough to attack it.

Ling Han frowned upon hearing this. Everything was progressing according to Extermination’s plans. Not long ago, she had obstructed Ling Han and given Hysteria the opportunity to engulf all of the dimensions. Now, however, she was screwing Hysteria over and pushing it to the brink of destruction.

Just what was she playing at?

Ling Han felt an instinctive urge to refuse her proposal. However, Hysteria had already become their greatest threat, so it was necessary that they eliminate it as soon as possible.

If it were killed now, they still had an opportunity to rebuild the Genesis World.

However, Extermination was definitely scheming something else. She definitely wasn’t trying to help them.

If she had truly been acting in the best interests of the Genesis World, then she would have allied with Ling Han a long time ago. With Ling Han’s power at that time, they could have easily suppressed Hysteria and stopped it from advancing. Once Ling Han advanced to the Seventh Tier, they could have then killed Hysteria with relative ease.

Yet, things had come to this instead.

That being the case, Extermination’s aim was definitely more than just killing Hysteria.

In any case, she had repeatedly mentioned a new age and jumping out of this small pond. Thus, killing Hysteria was most likely… only a single aspect of her plans.

The problem was, what if Extermination knew that Ling Han would think like this? Thus, she was doing the opposite of what she meant, and her true intention was actually for Ling Han not to attack?

Ling Han felt slightly hesitant. There was an information asymmetry between them, so he could only rely on guessing.

He looked at Extermination, and Extermination simply smiled faintly at him. She was stunningly beautiful, and it was as if everything was within her grasp.

Ling Han immediately made up his mind.

Whoosh!

He charged forward and unleashed a furious punch at Hysteria.

The reason for this was simple. If Extermination didn’t block his attack, then that would mean that she truly wanted him to attack Hysteria. If that were the case, then he would retract his attack straight away. If the inverse were true, however, and Extermination stepped forward to block him, then it would prove that she was uttering a load of trash.

His attack was as quick as lightning.

Extermination didn’t stop him, yet Ling Han didn’t retract his attack, either.

Just as Ling Han’s fist was about to strike Hysteria…

Whoosh!

Extermination finally made her move. She immediately dashed beside Hysteria and unleashed a palm strike at Ling Han.

The three of them were almost standing in a straight line, with Hysteria in the middle. Moreover, Extermination was closer to Hysteria, so even though she had launched her attack later, it was her attack that landed first.

Peng!

Extermination was immediately sent flying by the shock wave, with her face as white as a sheet.

Even as strong as Extermination was, she still couldn’t withstand the power of Ling Han’s devastating attack. She would definitely be at a disadvantage if she faced his attacks head-on.

Surprisingly, however, Ling Han didn’t attack her or Hysteria again.

There was surprise in Extermination’s beautiful eyes as she stood in the distance.

“You’re very good at acting. You purposely stepped forward just then, and you acted as if you wanted to stop me at all costs,” Ling Han said calmly. “However, since you’ve set up such a scenario, you naturally would have considered the fact that I would guess your intentions and use this method to probe you.

“So, I speculated that you’ve set up a scheme within a scheme.

“This current scenario is still a facade, something you’re using to cover up your true intentions!”

Extermination’s expression finally changed.

Wah!

She vomited a mouthful of blood, which immediately combusted upon hitting the ground, turning into a pile of ashes. She stared at Ling Han for a long time, eventually saying, “Who would’ve thought that you could make such a calm judgment in such a short amount of time and in the face of such a complicated situation?”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I was simply taking a gamble.”

Extermination suddenly roared with laughter, and said, “Very well! Then you’ve gambled correctly! However, after planning and preparing for so many years, is this something that you can interfere with?”

She recited some chant, and her beautiful face instantly became even paler. She spat out another mouthful of blood, and this again combusted into ashes just like before. She then pointed at Hysteria from a distance.

Whoosh!

A burst of black air rushed at Hysteria.

This was definitely nothing good.

Ling Han humphed coldly and swung a fist at the burst of black air.

Meanwhile, Lin Luo and the others all wore strange expressions. The situation was changing far too quickly.

In the beginning, it had been them struggling and trying to attack Hysteria, while Extermination was the one doing everything she could to stop them. Now, however, the situation was the complete opposite. It was Extermination who was trying to attack Hysteria, and it was Ling Han who was trying to stop her and protect Hysteria.

This situation was far too strange.

Ling Han’s punch slammed into the burst of black air. However, his fist eerily passed through the black air, and it was as if the back air didn’t exist at all.

Whoosh!

The black air entered Hysteria’s body and didn’t exit again.

Ling Han turned around to observe the situation with a frown. What was this black air? It was ineffective against him, yet it was incredibly destructive toward Hysteria.

Hysteria’s aura became increasingly unstable after being infiltrated by the black air, and it was as if it were about to explode at any moment.

“This is another secret code of death that I obtained from the Genesis World’s Will of the last era,” Extermination explained calmly. However, unleashing this attack had placed a huge burden on her, and she immediately spat out another mouthful of blood. Her aura also plummeted drastically.

“This attack is only effective against dimensions, so it’s impossible for you to stop it.”

Ling Han chuckled coldly, saying, “With your current situation, how many more times can you unleash such an attack?”

He charged at Extermination, not giving her another opportunity to attack.

Extermination dodged, not willing to face Ling Han head-on. Instead, she found opportunities to continually attack Hysteria.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

She attacked Hysteria again and again. Even though the burden on her was so immense that she wanted to vomit her internal organs, she still persisted and continued to attack.

She attacked relentlessly, and Hysteria was finally unable to withstand this pressure any longer. Its colossal body undulated like water, and all of a sudden, a column of blindingly bright light erupted from its body.
