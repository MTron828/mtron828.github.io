Chapter 2300: War Soldier

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Hu Niu stuck her tongue out, and said, “Disgusting!”

She was a standard glutton, so in her eyes, there was no such thing as adorable or not adorable. There only existed delicious or disgusting.

Meanwhile, the Empress didn’t pay any heed to this. She was no glutton, and she was as proud as could be. She believed that she was the greatest and most beautiful in the entire world. No one could rival her.

The metallic person slowly walked over in a mechanical manner. It swayed from left to right, and sure enough, it appeared fairly adorable.

“Here, give me a hug,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said as she immediately jumped forward. She extended her arms toward the metallic person.

Whir.

‘The metallic person raised its head to look at Bewitching Maiden Rou. At the same time, two rays of red light shot from its eyes, racing toward Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Bewitching Maiden Rou gave a soft shout as she immediately crossed her arms before her chest, drawing on the Regulations and forming a shield.

Peng!

The two rays of red light struck the shield, causing intense light to erupt into the surroundings. Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was forcefully pushed back.

Thud, thud, thud.

She retreated a dozen or so steps before finally coming to a stop.

‘The metallic person didn’t stop, and with a jump, it continued to attack Bewitching Maiden Rou.

“Are you picking on me?” Bewitching Maiden Rou shouted in anger. This machine looked so adorable, yet it actually dared to attack her? She no longer found it adorable.

She resolutely attacked, unleashing her Earth Soul cultivation. However, her battle prowess was at the peak stage of the Fifth Soul, and this was enough to crush almost everyone at the Dividing Soul Tier.

Crackle.

The eyes of the metallic person lit up. This was its attacking method, and it was capable of attacking from range. Moreover, its attacks were relatively powerful, and it was able to force Bewitching Maiden Rou back.

Everyone was astounded. What in the world was this metallic person?

If it had been at the Eighth Lotus, then suppressing Bewitching Maiden Rou shouldn’t have been a problem. If it were at the Seventh Lotus, however, just what kind of incredible craftsmanship would be required to allow it to possess this limit-breaking battle prowess?

This was definitely a puppet.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s expression changed, and she exclaimed, “This is a War Soldier from the Dark Inverse Realm!”

“That’s right, it’s definitely a War Soldier!” After hearing her reminder, everyone nodded in agreement. They all wore expressions of realization.

Ling Han’s interest was piqued. How did the Dark Inverse Realm possess so many strange and peculiar things?

This dimension was seemingly very reliant on external items. For example, their armor could greatly increase the battle prowess of cultivators. Moreover, he had only obtained the crudest of such armor. It hadn’t been forged with care, and could easily become pieces of precious armor after being placed

here for three years.

That being the case, just how formidable would the exquisitely created pieces of armor be?

Now, another strange War Soldier had appeared before them. It was most likely at the Dividing Soul Tier, yet its battle prowess could surpass the Heaven Soul. It was truly astonishing, One had to realize that only Heaven Soul emperor tiers could rival Bewitching Maiden Rou.

The battle was intense, and Bewitching Maiden Rou was completely unable to gain an advantage.

Her strong suit was charm techniques, yet her opponent was a battle robot with no sentience. It could be said that her beauty was being shown to a blind being, It was completely useless. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Thus, she could only rely on her physical skills to battle against this robot. However, this wasn’t her strong suit, so she was completely unable to suppress the War Soldier.

Ling Han became increasingly interested in the creations of the Dark Inverse Realm. If he could steal this knowledge and bring it back to the Celestial Realm, he could greatly increase the strength of the Celestial Realm. At that time, resisting the invasion of the Foreign Realm would be far easier than it

was now.

He stepped forward and grabbed at the War Soldier.

Upon seeing this, Bewitching Maiden Rou cooperatively jumped back. She didn’t try to stubbornly prove her strength. Before Ling Han, she knew when to advance and when to retreat. She definitely wouldn’t steal Ling Han’s thunder on purpose, nor would she lose face for him.

Peng!

With a single push of his palm, Ling Han immediately pinned the War Soldier to the ground. It was completely unable to move.

He possessed battle prowess matching the Third Secret of the Immortal Palace Tier!

Everyone had already become accustomed to this. They knew that Ling Han’s power was already at an indescribable level.

Ling Han subconsciously used his divine sense to observe the War Soldier. However, the War Soldier immediately shattered with a crack. This was just like the precious armor from before.

Ling Han picked up a piece of the broken War Soldier, and carefully examined it. It was filled with thin metallic threads that were woven in a tremendously complex pattern.

It had self-destructed again!

The Dark Inverse Realm had seemingly integrated special structures into all of their creations. It didn’t matter if these creations fell into the hands of their enemies—if the latter were too weak, they would be unable to observe these creations with their divine sense. If they were too strong, however, their

divine sense would also cause these creations to immediately self-destruct. This prevented their enemies from discovering any secrets.

This made things extremely difficult. If these creations couldn’t be examined, how could Ling Han replicate them, and bring the technology back to the Celestial Realm?

Ling Han shook his head, and casually tossed the piece of metal aside.

The others didn’t pick it up, either. This was a crippled War Soldier, and they existed all throughout the Two Realm Battlefield. In fact, there were many that were countless times more powerful than this one. However, even though the Ancestral Kings had examined them for innumerable epochs, they

had still come up empty-handed. They couldn’t find anything of worth.

“Let’s go.” They continued to advance. Right now, their goal had already moved on from trying to discover the secrets of the War Soldier. Instead, they were trying to figure out how to leave this place. Otherwise, they would all die of old age in a measly 1000 years.

They continued to venture forward. This time, they kept their ears perked for any changes in the sound of their footsteps lest they were subject to another surprise attack. The battle prowess of these War Soldiers was astounding. Moreover, who was to say there wasn’t a more powerful one lying in wait?

After walking for an hour, they all came to a stop. This was because they heard an extra pair of footsteps.

Tap, tap, tap.

These footsteps were rapidly closing in. It was far quicker than the previous War Soldier.

Was this a completely different War Soldier?

They looked behind them. However, this place was far too dark, so their vision was severely impeded. They could only see a meter around them.

After a short while, a figure appeared before them.

“F*ck! Why is it a person!”

This wasn’t a War Soldier, but rather a member of the Demon Race. He had a single horn on his head, and he was none other than the elite from the Baoyu Clan.

He was slightly disheveled, and his body was riddled with wounds. He wore a cruel and vicious expression on his face.

Even though he had unleashed his trump card and fought with his life against the holy deer, he had still been no match for it. His companions had all been eaten alive, and only he had been fortunate enough to escape. Moreover, this was only because he had reached the Holy Mountain. Otherwise, he

would have definitely been killed.

He placed all of his resentment on Ling Han and the others. Moreover, he also knew about the valley, so he gave chase all the way over. Even though he didn’t catch up to Ling Han and the others, he discovered the hole that they had dug. Thus, he continued to pursue them.

At this moment, he finally caught up.

“Kneel!” he bellowed in an icy voice. All of his companions had been killed, filling him with both grief and fury. However, he didn’t dare to seek revenge on the holy deer. Thus, he could only take his anger out on Ling Han and the others.

“Single-homed beast, not only are you ugly, but even your mouth is stinky,” Ling Han said with disdain.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others all found this funny. This was because Ling Han also had two horns, yet he was calling the other person a single-horned beast. Then what was he? A two-horned beast? Did he not see the irony in this?

“Impertinence!” the single-horned demon roared with a humph. His right hand swiped at Hu Niu and the others. He knew that Ling Han was extremely strange. Even though his battle prowess was inferior, his physique was sturdy enough to withstand his attacks. Thus, he decided to capture Hu Niu and

the others first.

“What audacity!” Ling Han’s gaze became ice-cold.

Swoosh!

The Divine Demon Sword was unsheathed, and a flash of blue soared through the air, sending an arm tumbling into the sky. The arm then thumped into the ground.

This arm... belonged to the single-horned demon.

This person was called Baoyu Jianying, and he was transfixed with shock and disbelief as he stared at his severed arm. He then looked at the sword in Ling Han’s hand with an incredulous expression.

“F*ck!”
