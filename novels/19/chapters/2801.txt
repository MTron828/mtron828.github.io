2802 Do something about it

“You?” Ling Han shook his head. “It’s not that I look down on you, but you are not worthy to be my opponent.”

“Ling Han…!” He Yufeng gritted his teeth. How domineering he had been back when he could actually suppress Ling Han with just one move. If Lin Piaoxue hadn’t made a move back then, this guy would have already been dead long ago. How would he have had the right to be arrogant now?

The Empress stood up. “I’ll kill you!”

He Yufeng became so angry that his expression turned hideous. Why was it that the people by Ling Han’s side could be so arrogant? She was merely a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, and yet wanted to suppress himself?

!!

He gave a humph, and said, “Fine, I want to see this guy’s expression once I suppress you!”

The Empress’ beauty made his heart skip a beat; how painful would it be if he killed the Empress in front of Ling Han?

What a good idea.

“Ling Han, our young master is going to suppress you.” Behind them, those mutinous and unscrupulous people called out. They were cheering for He Yufeng while mocking Ling Han. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ling Han’s eyes sharpened, and wherever his gaze swept, there wasn’t anyone among these people who didn’t lose their voice.

A Heavenly Venerate had been angered, and the heaven and earth were moved, so who would still dare to shout?

“Why keep quiet?” He Liqun said lightly as he turned around to give a sweeping glance, which immediately made those people’s hearts beat like drums, so they could only bite the bullet, and once again started rattling off a string of curses.

He Liqun stroked his beard and smiled. In the past, he had been scolded most terribly by Ling Han, but he took pride in his status, so naturally he felt disdain to bring himself to curse others.

The Empress jumped out and charged murderously towards He Yufeng.

Boom!

The two Heavenly Venerates immediately started a fierce battle.

After exchanging only a few blows, He Yufeng’s expression turned to one of shock.

The Empress’ strength far exceeded his expectations; not only was she not easily suppressed by him, she was actually even stronger than him.

How was this possible?

It was already bad enough with Ling Han being freakish; why were the people around him just as freakish?

The Empress’ attacks became more and more severe; she had already endured for a month, and now that she could finally make a move, all of that burst out in each attack that she shot out.

Ling Han nodded. Indeed, the Empress had fused the power of 100 dimensions. Although currently she was still in the middle stage of the First Tier, her battle prowess was at the middle stage of the Second Tier, having completely crossed a cultivation level.

And what about He Yufeng?

Although he was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, he was only in the early stage of the Second Tier, and his battle prowess was also in line with the cultivation level, which obviously made him inferior to the Empress.

Therefore, He Yufeng was suppressed by the Empress as soon as he came up to fight.

He Yufeng also knew this, but didn’t worry about it too much, as battle prowess wasn’t determined merely by strength alone, but also Heavenly Venerate Techniques, Heavenly Venerable Seals, and Heavenly Venerate Tools!

Weng, he drew out a sword with seven seals glowing on it, which he had applied the power of a Heavenly Venerate to, and then boosted with the Heavenly Venerate Technique and Heavenly Venerable Seal, and unleashed his attacks towards the Empress.

The Empress didn’t have a Heavenly Venerate Tool—she was at a disadvantage in this regard. She avoided the sharp sword. Wandering around continuously, she then sent out her jade-like palm in a palm strike, circulated the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate, and boosted it with a Heavenly Venerable Seal—her battle prowess suddenly soared.

As far as strength was concerned, of course the Empress was stronger, but He Yufeng had a Heavenly Venerate Tool in hand. He wasn’t in a disadvantageous position, and could completely make up for the gap in strength.

The two fought fiercely, but there wasn’t a clear victor for a while.

Anyway, it seemed both were evenly matched. However, everyone knew that He Yufeng had already lost, and it wasn’t just by a tiny bit.

…A Second Tier was fighting against a First Tier, and even used a Heavenly Venerate Tool, but it was just a draw. Would you not be embarrassed?

He Yufeng’s face became flushed as he felt frustrated, furious, and ashamed all at once. Even the people by Ling Han’s side could win against the strong from a position of weakness, being able to fight against him even if their cultivation level was lower by a minor tier. This was too unreasonable.

“That’s enough!” He Liqun shouted in a deep voice. He didn’t want his son to continue suffering such psychological blows, otherwise it wouldn’t be an encouragement to his son at all, but rather hitting his self-confidence and making him doubt his life.

He Yufeng launched a few more attacks before stopping with great reluctance and retreating.

Ling Han shook his head. “My wife, with her cultivation level being the First Tier, fought against you, and she nearly beat the crap out of you. Therefore, trash like you should toe the line more, and not come out to embarrass yourself.”

He Yufeng’s eyes blazed with fire, and yet he didn’t refute, because the statement was based on true facts.

Ling Han crooked his finger towards He Liqun. “Old geezer, it’s your turn now.”

He Liqun sneered. “An eloquent speaker you may be, but in the face of absolute strength, there will only be grievance for you.”

Ling Han laughed out loud. “Who was the one being beaten to a pulp by me back then? If you hadn’t run so fast, you would have been dead by now, right?”

He Liqun’s gaze sharpened. When he had been thrashed by Ling Han in the past, it had actually been witnessed by everyone in public, which was a shame he could never erase. He snorted. “I will accomplish what I have originally said then, which is to flatten Ling City!”

He made a move. Boom, terrifying forces condensed, turned into a monstrous giant hand, and pressed towards Ling City.

With the power of a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, when this blow swept past, Ling City would definitely cease to exist forever.

Ling Han also made a move, immediately drawing out the Divine Demon Sword. With a slash of the sword towards the sky, shua, the big hand was instantly split right in the middle, and the parts fell on two opposite sides.

Peng!

The ground shook as these two powers hit the eastern and western side of the city, respectively, causing a strong earthquake.

Ling Han held his sword and charged murderously towards He Liqun. He couldn’t let the other party act recklessly, otherwise Ling City would really be reduced to ruins if he was even slightly negligent.

“You’re seeking death!” He Liqun said coldly. He naturally wouldn’t be afraid of a fight, and started exchanging blows with Ling Han.

He didn’t care about the life or death of the surrounding people, and immediately exploded with full power.

Remember that there were many unscrupulous people right behind him. At this moment, they were jolted by the power which exploded out of him, and 99% of them turned to dust. Only four or five people were spared, but they were also severely wounded and not far from death.

All of them regretted it so much. Had they had known earlier, they would not have joined in the commotion and ended up losing their lives.

Ling Han fought a fierce battle against He Liqun.

He immediately went all out to channel the Heavenly Venerable Seal, Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate Technique, Five Elements Lightning Technique, and the others, but he was lacking greatly in strength due to the difference in cultivation level. There was too wide a disparity in the battle prowess between him and He Liqun. The other party just needed to make a move at will, and he could already crush Ling Han to death.

“Merely a First Tier,” He Liqun said disdainfully.

But deep in his heart, he was truly shaken and in shock. A First Tier Heavenly Venerate could even fight so fiercely that it made him envious and resentful.

...

However, this would eventually become history. As long as he killed this freak, it would eliminate any future trouble.

“Ling Han!” A delicate voice suddenly rang out. “Niu is back!”

It was Hu Niu.

“Friend He, do listen to me. How about letting it go?” A woman’s voice also rang out. Although it wasn’t loud, it was filled with frightening power.

He Liqun couldn’t help feeling startled. He frowned and turned his head to look.

A beautiful woman dressed in imperial robes was standing not too far away, holding a whisk dust in her hand, and exuding an aura of elegance and tranquility.

“Friend Earnest Meditation!” He Liqun greeted the other party with a nod of his head. She was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate whose strength was not inferior to his, and of course couldn’t be taken lightly. However, it was also impossible for him to let the matter drop just like that. “This matter has nothing to do with Friend Earnest Meditation, so please don’t interfere.”

Heavenly Venerate Earnest Meditation shook her head. “This person is the husband of my disciple, it is imperative that I do something about it.”
