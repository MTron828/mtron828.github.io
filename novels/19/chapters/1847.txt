Chapter 1848: I Can Even Cause Trouble By Eating Meat

“Commander, we’ve already been searching for him for more than half a year. Perhaps...” a female knight in silver armor said to Commander Guan in hesitation.

Since their separation with Ling Han, they had been searching for his whereabouts this entire time... although they had already come to a conclusion in their minds. In the face of such furious shock waves, Ling Han had definitely been killed.

However, just how much did Hu Niu long for Ling Han? They naturally couldn’t give up just because they couldn’t find him. Thus, they all worked hard to search for him every single day.

However, they all knew that Ling Han had definitely died. It was just that no one wanted to bring this up first.

Commander Guan fell silent for a moment. She then retrieved some materials, and constructed a mini-formation. With this done, she retrieved a piece of pitch-black rock. She wore a pained expression, yet she still gritted her teeth and placed the rock inside the formation.

The formation instantly lit up. Like a mirror, a figure then appeared before them. This was an indescribably beautiful woman who was filled with liveliness and vigor. She immediately jumped over, and she asked, “Have you found Niu’s Ling Han?”

Upon seeing her excitement, Commander Guan couldn’t help but start to shed cold sweat. She paused for a moment before replying, “Young Imperial Empress, your subordinate indeed found Ling Han...”

“Where is he? Where’s Ling Han?” Hu Niu asked and looked around. She didn’t possess the dignity and reservedness of a successor of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force at all.

It was all the fault of this man!

Fortunately, he had died. Although the Young Imperial Empress would feel depressed for a while, she would eventually overcome this sadness.

“Young Imperial Empress, we came across a battle between two elites while we were returning. We were caught up in the shock waves, and Ling Han... Ling Han... suffered the misfortune of being struck by them!” Commander Guan said as she gritted her teeth. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Hu Niu faltered for a moment before flaring up in rage, and shouting, “Nonsense! How can Niu’s Ling Han die?! Hurry up and find Ling Han back for Niu! Otherwise, I’ll feed you to a Dogbear!”

Cold sweat trickled down Commander Guan’s forehead. Ling Han had already died, so how could she find him back?

However, Hu Niu was certain that Ling Han hadn’t died. She knew about the existence of the Black Tower, and after becoming mature, she had looked into the origin of the Black Tower. She had discovered some clues, so she was certain that Ling Han couldn’t have been killed so easily.

“Anyhow, Ling Han hasn’t died. Find him for Niu! If you don’t find him, then don’t even think about returning!” she said angrily. A thought suddenly flashed through her mind, and she said, “No, Niu is personally going to look for him. Niu doesn’t feel reassured leaving these matters to you! And those sh*tty elites and whatnot. They can also wait for Niu! Niu will definitely blast them into smithereens!”

“Young Imperial Empress, you can’t’!” Apart from Commander Guan, even the female knights in silver armor hurriedly started to discourage Hu Niu.

It was far too significant for the Young Imperial Empress to leave. What if their mortal enemies learned of this and ambushed them halfway?

Commander Guan knelt down on one knee, and said with confidence, “Rest assured, Young Imperial Empress. We’ll definitely find Ling Han!” Even if Ling Han had truly died, she was still prepared to wander around for a few hundred thousand years. She would definitely prevent the Young Imperial Empress from leaving until she succeeded in cultivation.

However, Hu Niu angrily shook her head, and said, “No, no, no! Niu doesn’t feel reassured by you people! Niu is going to personally look for Ling Han!”

Commander Guan and the others immediately started to wipe the cold sweat from their brows. In terms of troublemaking, this Young Imperial Empress could seemingly rank first.

Moreover, even though Commander Guan possessed a superior cultivation level, the hierarchical order of the Roc Palace was extremely strict. In any case, the title of Young Imperial Empress didn’t simply signify that Hu Niu was a potential successor. It was only because her cultivation level was still low that there was a “Young” before her title. However, she would definitely become the Imperial Empress in the future. There would be no other option.

Did they dare to scold Hu Niu?

Anyhow, the grand elder most likely wouldn’t allow the Young Imperial Empress to muck around... right?

With this in mind, they didn’t try to discourage Hu Niu anymore.

‘We’ll keep searching. Since the Young Imperial Empress insists, we’ll do everything that we can.’

Ling Han slowly strolled around. Right now, the Empress was cultivating in seclusion in order to advance to the fourth severance. Even with the help of the Reincarnation Tree, this would most likely still take an extremely long amount of time. She wouldn’t be coming out of the Black Tower any time soon.

‘How can I find Commander Guan and the others?’

It was almost impossible to coincidentally come across the right person in the Celestial Realm. After all, the Celestial Realm was far too large.

Thus, he had to make himself become more noticeable. He had to cause some commotion. That way, Commander Guan and the others would perhaps hear news of him, and find their way over. Of course, this was on the premise that they still believed he was alive.

‘Then I’ll go to the nearest city first. If Commander Guan isn’t stupid, she’ll most likely think of this possibility as well. The chance of coming across her in the wilderness is far too small. If I enter a city, however, I can ask around for some information.’

This region had already been razed into flat earth. Thus, he couldn’t find anyone to ask where the nearest city was. That being the case, he could only randomly pick a direction.

After walking for seven days, he was still traveling through forests and grasslands. There was no sign of civilization.

‘Hmm?’

He sniffed slightly, and he could smell an alluring aroma. As a glutton and an alchemist, he was certain that this was the smell of a Three Stone Deer being roasted. Moreover, it had been marinated with at least 13 different spices. Among these spices were three extremely high-level medicinal ingredients.

Ling Han involuntarily walked toward the source of this aroma. He entered a small forest, only to see a man currently sitting on a rock in a patch of empty land. There was a campfire before him, and there was a piece of meat roasting above this fire. It gave off an appetizing aroma.

The man turned around upon hearing Ling Han approach. He was slightly robust, and even when sitting down, he was still half a head taller than most ordinary people. He was extremely handsome, and he more so possessed an air of composure about him. Judging from his appearance, he was at most in his early twenties.

Of course, age was insignificant in the Celestial Realm. However, this person’s flame of life was still extremely lively and vigorous. Thus, he definitely wouldn’t be too old.

However, it was clear that he hadn’t expected anyone to come. There was a hint of astonishment on his face.

“Friend, can you share some of your food?” Ling Han shamelessly asked. As a glutton, being overly familiar with strangers was naturally a necessary skill.

The young man faltered for a brief moment before smiling and casually waving his hand. “Be my guest!” He secretly gave a signal.

Ling Han saw this, yet he didn’t expose the young man. Instead, he sat down and retrieved a small knife to cut off a piece of roast meat. He then started to chow down on it. “Delicious!” he praised.

The young man smiled faintly. He retrieved a bottle of wine and handed it to Ling Han. His smile was extremely meaningful.

Ling Han accepted the bottle of wine and gladly chugged it down. He then ate some more roast meat. His entire body felt satisfied and relaxed.

“Young Master!” At this instant, seven people suddenly ran over from different directions. They all kneeled down on one knee to greet the young man. However, when they saw Ling Han, they couldn’t help but feel astonished.

The young man’s surname was Lu, and he was called Lu Xianming. As he gazed at Ling Han, his expression gradually became baleful. “Friend, there’s no need to act anymore. Where’s Chen Si? Did you kill him, or did you knock him unconscious?”

He was resting here, and he had commanded his eight subordinates to spread apart to guard eight different directions. Yet, Ling Han had suddenly appeared, and Chen Si, the person who had been responsible for guarding that direction, hadn’t returned. It was extremely obvious what had happened.

Ling Han was astonished. He then started to perform a deep reflection of his actions. He was definitely a magnet for trouble. He had simply been attracted here by the aroma of meat, yet he was still caught up in some kind of trouble...

‘F*ck!’
