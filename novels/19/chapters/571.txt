Chapter 572: Resolving The Formation

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“Since you can’t fight me, don’t blabber so much!” Feng Po Yun waved his hands. “Get lost, I’m going to break the formation.”

Bai Yuan wouldn’t possibly dare to block him. Only Feng Po Yun was slightly easier to talk to; if it were any other Shattering Void Tier elite, he would have already died several hundred times. He hurriedly ran into the formation—only inside the Fourth Killing Formation did he have any sense of security.

The Fourth Killing Formation could kill even high-level Shattering Void Tier elites, and although the formation wasn’t complete, killing low-level Shattering Void Tier warriors still wasn’t an issue. If the Thousand Corpse Sect could use the death of a Shattering Void Tier elite to declare their reappearance, then it would definitely cause a stir through the word.

Thinking about this, Bai Yuan couldn’t help but get excited—would he personally be the one to bring about such a miracle?

Killing a Shattering Void Tier elite... this was no different from killing a god.

Killing a god to reestablish their sect, intimidating the entire world!

‘Come, come, use your life to announce the return of the Thousand Corpse Sect! Then, we’ll refine your corpse into a Corpse Soldier—a Holy Corpse Soldier that surpasses Golden-Armored Corpses!’

Feng Po Yu walked with large strides and entered the large formation with black mist swirling around him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Atop the city wall, everyone was nervous. This was truly the end of the line. They’d originally thought that they’d be trapped and die in the city, and never would’ve thought that a Shattering Void Tier would suddenly appear; there was hope in breaking the formation.

In everyone’s hearts, Shattering Void Tier elites were undefeatable legends, just like the existence of gods; they believed that if Feng Po Yun intervened, that large formation would definitely be broken.

In a short while, terrifying divine light surged from afar and rippled over, instantly provoking the reaction of the great city-guarding formation, which started forming a shield. Even so, everyone’s legs still shivered in fear and panic.

This was a battle on the Shattering Void Tier level, and if it weren’t for the existence of the great city-guarding formation, the ripples alone could make Heaven Tier warriors hack out blood, and Deity Transformation Tier ones break down into pieces.

The power of the humanity’s peak, so powerful that it couldn’t be fathomed.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The terrifying battle continued; flashes of divine light shot towards the horizon, shaking the skies. Even the void was torn apart, and a constellation of stars was shattered and fell, turning into a stream of meteors 1 .

Ling Han suddenly felt an itch inside. In the vast lands, most tenth tier rare metals were harvested from meteors, and where did these meteors come from? They obviously came from constellations of stars. However, men’s powers were limited, so how could anyone pluck stars and grab moons?

There were terrifying gales that covered the skies densely, and even Heaven Tier elites couldn’t fly to the limit, so how could one speak of catching stars? Only Shattering Void Tier warriors possessed the power near humanity’s limits, approaching the power limit that this realm could accommodate. Only then could one reach out to shake down the stars.

Feng Po Yun battled fiercely against the Fourth Killing Formation and shattered many stars that turned into meteors falling to the ground. Although tenth tier rare metal could not be harvested from every star, but there should be at least one or two, right?

Unfortunately, the Fourth Killing Formation still hadn’t been broken through, and if he were to charge out rashly, he would definitely be crushed to death.

There were many people who harbored the same idea, and their gazes were burning with desire, but firstly, the killing formation deterred them, and secondly... who dared to take a mighty Shattering Void Tier’s belongings? That would truly be getting tired of living.

The divine light shone on the world, shockingly terrifying; how many people could’ve personally seen a battle on the Shattering Void Tier level?

Now, everyone was destined to witness it, but separated by a formation, no one could truly see clearly. They could only sense the ripples of the battle and imagine the powerfulness of the Shattering Void Tier.

After some fierce fighting, suddenly, there was no more sound.

It was over?

“Look, the mist is starting to fade!” someone cried out.

As expected, the mist certainly began to disperse at a fast pace, as if sucked by an air vent. In a few breaths’ time, the black mist that covered the surrounding ground and the skies disappeared completely.

The Fourth Killing Formation had been deactivated.

Extremely far away, Feng Po Yun’s expression was filled with loneliness. A victory that people could only dream of was not worth a mention for him. He drank a mouthful of fine wine, and took large strides towards the city gates.

Ling Han had to admit that this older brother had already surpassed the level of showing off, reaching new heights.

“So he’s actually that impressive?” Helian Xunxue said in a quiet voice.

“Huh, do you know him?” Zhu Xuan Er said astoundingly.

“Yesterday, Han Han and I bumped into him. He and Han Han drank and became sworn brothers,” Helian Xunxue said.

Pu!

Zhu Xuan Er instantly spurted out. Becoming sworn brothers with a Shattering Void Tier elite...? This was truly like a fantasy! But thinking again, Ling Han was a Heaven Grade alchemist, so becoming sworn brothers with a Shattering Void Tier elite wasn’t overreaching, as they were both at the peak of their respective fields.

Ling Han, however, looked disgusted as his expression distorted. Han Han? When did this chick come up with a nickname for him?

Everyone hurriedly came down the city walls and opened the gates, welcoming Feng Po Yun’s return.

Shattering Void Tier elites were supreme beings, and usually seeing them was as hard as climbing the skies, but this time, they actually received the help of a Shattering Void Tier... truly unexpected.

“Lord Feng!”

“Lord Feng!”

Yin Xue Yang and the other Heaven Tier warriors paid their respects. The others had no chance to speak, and simply knelt down in the distance.

Feng Po Yun nodded, and said, “I owed Yin San a favor. He requested a few days ago that if Million Treasures City were to encounter a crisis, I should help him resolve it. So, you guys don’t need to thank me.”

Yin San wasn’t just anyone, or else how could a Shattering Void Tier owe him a favor! He was Spirit Treasures Pavilion’s Great Pavilion Master, named Yin Shan. Being ranked third, many that were familiar with him called him Yin San2 .

Of course, only Shattering Void Tier elites would dare call him Yin San.

Yin Xue Yang suddenly realized why Great Pavilion Master didn’t worry about leaving with the other seven Pavilion Masters; as it turned out, there was already a foolproof plan.

With a Shattering Void Tier elite keeping an eye out, wasn’t that certain enough that nothing would go wrong? But, as to why Feng Po Yun didn’t intervene earlier, leading them to assume that all was over...

Well, who would dare question a Shattering Void Tier elite?

He was able to intervene, so you’d better thank the heavens.

Feng Po Yun was obviously received by a few Heaven Tier elites only. Others had no right to go up, but some people still wanted to cause trouble.

“Han Lin, return the Origin Crystals!” someone shouted at Ling Han.

“That’s right, we didn’t use yesterday’s quotas at all, so return the Origin Crystals!”

“Hand over the Origin Crystals!”

Yesterday, the people who bought the 180 quotas all shouted at Ling Han. In order to save their lives, they were cut fiercely. Now that the crisis was lifted, the more they thought about it, the more they were dissatisfied about it.

Moreover, Ling Han was a mere Flower Blossom Tier, and although there was a freakish little girl by his side, she was still small, after all. The larger girl only had amazing brute force, and was at most in the Spiritual Infant Tier.

On the other side, there was a handful of Deity Transformation Tier experts, and even Heaven Tier beings.

“Return the Origin Crystals!” Countless people demanded of Ling Han.
