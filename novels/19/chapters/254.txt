Chapter 255: The Wedding Begins

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Though Ling Han was only in the Gushing Spring Tier, he also had the eyes of someone who used to be in the Heaven Tier. He would be able to tell with a single glance someone’s cultivation level as long as they were below the Heaven Tier.

But he actually couldn’t see through Yan Tian Zhao now?

Had the latter already reached the Heaven Tier?

That was impossible. That was absolutely impossible. Even he, the Alchemy Emperor, had spent two hundred years to finally achieve this step, and no one had achieved such an impressive feat before him. Although it was impossible that no one managed to repeat his achievement, but there would definitely not appear a young man in his mid-teens who managed to reach the Heaven Tier.

Ling Han observed him closely, and could not help but frown faintly. He could somewhat sense an imcomparably evil aura from Yan Tian Zhao, but could not clearly describe what it exactly was.

But what could be confirmed was that this aura had formed a kind of barrier, which did not let him see through Yan Tian Zhao.

Ling Han could not help but heave a sigh internally. Though he had met such monsters as the Sword Emperor and the Phoenix Maiden in his last life, at that time, he was already standing at the peak of the world. Thus, he would not feel anything strange about meeting so many exceptional geniuses.

But what about this lifetime?

There first appeared a Rong Huan Xuan who had gained the inheritance of the Thousand Corpse Sect. Originally, he would have been able to reach the level of a monster, but after his body was taken over by Asura Demon Emperor, he would definitely be even more terrifying in the future.

And now here was a Yan Tian Zhao, who was capable of preventing Ling Han from seeing through him, which meant that the former’s monstrous level was definitely not low.

He was only in the Gushing Spring Tier, and was currently in the tiny little Rain Country, yet he had already encountered two people who could possibly become logic-defying in the future… then in the Nine Nations of the Desolate North, the whole Northern Region, or even in this whole world, how many such monsters would there be?

Weren’t there too many geniuses in this lifetime? He had so easily encountered them.

“So it’s Little Brother Yan.” Ling Han smiled, then looked left and right and asked, “Where’s Lady Yan?”

“My mother felt a little unwell and is currently resting at home, she has not come,” Yan Tian Zhao said politely, looking completely like a polite, well-mannered young man, making anyone who saw him unable to help but have a favorable impression of him.

Ling Han nodded and said, “Is Little Brother Yan planning to give me your support?”

“Haha, I am just here to attend Big Sister Yu Tong’s wedding today and enjoy a cup of wine. I don’t know about anything else.” Yan Tian Zhao laughed, and stepped to another side. He easily maneuvered, and his behavior was absolutely unlike a young man of his age.

This was seen by some old guys, and they could not help but be astonished. When had such a young man appeared in the Imperial City? Not only was he very mature, but even they were not able to see through to his cultivation level, which was something extremely strange.

“Ling Han!” A harsh voice was heard and they saw a tall man approach them. He said, “What are you doing here?”

Liu Bu Cheng, Liu Yu Tong’s Seventh Uncle. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han was pondering over his attitude as he asked, “It is Yu Tong’s wedding. Should I not come here to offer my congratulations?”

Liu Bu Cheng looked meaningfully at Ling Han, and was similarly pondering over Ling Han’s words. He frowned slightly and said, “If you have come to enjoy a cup of wine, then we would naturally welcome you, but if you are here to make a fuss, then the Liu Residence is not a place where you can do as you like.”

Ling Han smiled and nodded. He could not tell the attitude of the Liu Clan from Liu Bu Cheng’s words and tone. He was simply discussing the matter as it was.

‘Let’s just see, then.’

About all the guests had arrived, and they all took their seats. The majority of the seating was arranged in advance, but there were some exceptions such as Ling Han. However, they naturally had some emergency seats set aside, so he at least did not have to stand at one side.

“Fu Yuan Sheng, Grandmaster Fu, has arrived!” A servant announced, which instantly caused a shock to all those seated. That was one of the two Big Bosses of alchemy of Rain Country, who was merely beneath the Rain Emperor in status.

The Clan Head of the Liu Clan personally came out to receive Fu Yuan Sheng. The two of them walked side by side, smiling and laughing, and seemed to be having an enjoyable conversation.

The Liu Clan marrying one of their daughters actually managed to successfully invite Fu Yuan Sheng; what an honor was that?

But those seated were well aware that Fu Yuan Sheng could not possibly have come for the sake of the Liu Clan; instead, he was here because of Ling Han!

They had long heard that the two Big Bosses of alchemy were dearly fond of Ling Han, and Fu Yuan Sheng was personally here to attend the wedding today. He was obviously here to support Ling Han fully. How could this be mere fondness? This was practically pampering Ling Han like he was his own son.

“The Third Elder, Jia Bo Yuan, of Spirit Treasures Pavilion, Master Jia has arrived!” Fu Yuan Sheng had just taken his seat when another very important person had arrived.

Jia Bo Yuan’s status was not as high as Fu Yuan Sheng’s, but he was still someone who was in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and in Rain Country, that was an elite level. Usually, it would be difficult even to catch one glimpse of such elites, but they actually came to attend the wedding today.

Liu Yu Tong and Feng Ming did not have such face. Then Jia Bo Yuan either came here because of Ling Han, or because of Feng Yan.

It was unknown whose side he was on.

Right at this moment, Feng Yan finally arrived. He had his hands placed behind his back and casually sat at the most central seat. When his eyes passed over Ling Han, a cold smirk appeared at the corners of his lips and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

The unspoken words here were, I want you to watch as your own woman is married to another man, but what can you do?

Ling Han pretended he had not seen anything. It was not the time yet. There was no need to rush.

“The groom and the bride pay their respects to the Heavens and Earth!” the announcer called out loudly, and they could see a person walking out from either side of the Main Hall. On the left side was a young man who was wearing nuptial robes. He was quite good-looking, but filled with a sloppy, ruffian-like air. On the right side was a young woman in bridal robes. She was wearing a red veil on her head and was being supported by a maid servant on one side. She was slowly walking over.

Anyone who had eyes could see that the woman in bridal robes had her cultivation sealed, and was being forcefully dragged over by the maid servant beside her.

“Wait!” Ling Han stood up.

‘Here it is, here it is, here comes the grand show,’ everyone thought in their hearts, and they were all filled with anticipation—after all, what was so nice about attending a wedding anyways? They were not the groom, and the majority of the people here had come here for the confrontation between Ling Han and Feng Yan.

“What do you mean, Ling Han?” one of the clansmen of the Liu Clan asked frostily.

“I do not agree to this wedding!” Ling Han said with a shake of his head.

“Haha, who do you think you are? Does the Liu Clan marrying off one of their daughters still require your approval?” the man said icily. He was in his thirties, and was at the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier.

Ling Han looked at Liu Bu Cheng, but saw that the latter was completely unperturbed, as if he had no idea what was going on. Instantly, Ling Han understood. There were actually two voices in the Liu Clan. One was in support of marrying Liu Yu Tong off to Feng Ming, while the other was not in agreement.

However, the side that was in disagreement was obviously at a disadvantage. Thus, Liu Yu Tong had still come out to get married, but with the understanding that this would not affect the benefit of the entire Liu Clan, this side was still willing to open the back door for lIng Han.

Therefore, Ling Han had successfully entered into the Liu Residence. Otherwise, he would definitely have had to fight his way in.

Ling Han strode over and said, “Let me repeat, I do not agree to this wedding!”

“Get lost!” the clansman of the Liu Clan shouted, and flew over, delivering a punch towards Ling Han.

The fist approached, and there was a terrifying shock wave surrounding it. As a clansman of the Liu Clan, his battle prowess was more powerful than any other person in the seventh layer of the Gushing Spring Tier, and had already reached the level of an ordinary person in the eighth layer of the Gushing Spring Tier.

Ling Han raised his hand and casually threw a punch of his own.
