2920 Developing Dimensions

“You owe me 100,000,000 pieces of Divine Metal.” These were Wally’s first words.

Ling Han looked towards him, and saw that this guy was extremely weak, looking like he would collapse at the slightest breeze.

“The volume of these calculations is too great; at least half of my calculation units will collapse due to overload,” Wally said.

Ling Han nodded. “All right, all right, all right. To say nothing of 100,000,000, I can even get you a trillion pieces.”

As long as the Powers of Dimension in his body could evolve into real dimensions, then Divine Metal would really be a piece of cake for him.

Just look at Hysteria. It was only a dimension, yet could create countless Heavenly Venerates. If Ling Han could become a Genesis World himself, Divine Metal would naturally be no big deal. It could be created with a single thought from him.

Wally stretched out a finger and tapped on Ling Han’s forehead. Then, it lit up, transmitting countless formulae and laws to Ling Han.

Ling Han passively received these formulae and laws, and analyzed them alongside his own comprehension to perfect it.

“Wally, thanks a lot for this,” he said seriously.

“Don’t think that you can renege on the payment of 100,000,000 Divine Metal pieces just because you say these words,” Wally asserted.

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I definitely won’t cheat you. That’s right, this place may no longer be safe in the future. Go to the Profound Negative Realm; it will become a transcendent dimension in the future, replacing this place.”

“Are you trying to send me away so you can renege on the payment?” Wally asked suspiciously.

Because there were already plans to abandon the Flaming Frost Realm, the evacuation had naturally been carried out.

Moreover, the Profound Negative Realm would become a transcendent dimension in the future. At present, it was completely barren. All the forces wanted to settle in as soon as possible and divide the territory. Hence, it was necessary to send people over as soon as possible.

Ling Han went into seclusion. Though the front lines were important, it did not matter much even if he wasn’t there given the present situation. With the Power of Dimension suppressing the enemy troops, the Flaming Frost Army had an absolute advantage. They only had to sacrifice some territory from time to time.

When Ling Han used his cells to nurture the Powers of Dimension, that was because he thought that there would come a day when he could transform them into real dimensions. At that time, he himself would be a second Genesis World, and his battle prowess would be endless.

However, how could a single cell contain an entire dimension?

This would require Wally’s help.

In summary, it was very simple. Ling Han would build his own Regulations of Space so that his cells could be infinitely large. Then, it would not be an impossibility for a single cell to accommodate a whole dimension.

The conclusion was simple, but the process was extremely complicated.

Ling Han incorporated Wally’s proposal, but it was more about his own comprehension.

Calculation was Wally’s specialty, and Ling Han was standing at a higher position, using Wally’s calculations to test out his own ideas.

He was the real decision-maker and the executor of actions.

This was a very long process, but Ling Han had plenty of patience.

For those like Ling Xi, nurturing a dimension in their Dantian could be said to be a piece of cake. Even if they wanted to accommodate two dimensions at the same time like Bai Mifan, it could still be accomplished by a Seventh Tier elite, and they themselves only needed to nurture these two dimensions.

Ling Han was different. He was nurturing dimensions inside his cells, and there was no one he could learn from. Only Wally’s calculations could be of help–Ling Han proposed a great many possibilities, and Wally eliminated the completely impossible, reducing Ling Han’s workload.

He sat quietly, and the Heavenly Venerable Seals in his body all lit up, communicating with the heaven and earth, and extracting the two types of fundamental particles to nourish his body.

In the past, all the energy would be divided evenly among the cells in his body, and the two fundamental powers also needed to grow. There were really too many mouths that needed to be fed, which also caused Ling Han’s progress in cultivation to be astonishingly slow.

Right now, Ling Han was fully focused on nurturing two specific cells in his body.

That sped things up.

How many Heavenly Venerable Seals did he have in total?

More than 200. Not only did he have a first-grade seal, he had gathered all the seals of the eighth and ninth grade. With their resonance, how many times could his cultivation speed increase?

It should be known that this was not a battle where only one or a set of seals could take effect; instead, however many seals he had now was the number of seals that would take effect.

How many times had this increased his cultivation speed, then?

1362 times.

This kind of terrifying cultivation speed was completely focused on two cells, nourishing those two dimensions. What kind of concept was that?

Merely a mere 20,000 years had passed, and the Power of Dimension within these two cells was thriving and growing, each turning into a small world.

How small was it?

Just like the small world that Ling Han had planted in Ling Xi’s body in the past.

Ling Han revealed a smile, not because of the growth of these two dimensions, but rather due to formation of these dimensions.

From Power of Dimension into a real dimension, this step was too astonishing. It had never been seen in the past or present, and perhaps it would never happen again in the future.

However, this was only the beginning, the second step Ling Han had taken to become the strongest in all of history.

He began to strengthen these two dimensions. Time passed quickly, and soon another 900,000 years had passed. These two dimensions had both reached the extent of a medium-level dimension.

There was no way to advance any further. Ling Han himself was only a Third Tier, and there would be an upper limit to his physique.

Ling Han’s right hand turned over, turning a dimension into a projection and blasting it out. Space trembled, which was incredibly terrifying.

“It can’t compare to Bai Mifan’s,” he said softly.

This was normal. Bai Mifan was a Fourth Tier, and this was an advantage in cultivation level. It couldn’t be helped.

“If the quality is inferior, then I will use quantity to make up for it.”

Ling Han continued to cultivate in seclusion. He continued to cultivate to form the third and fourth dimension. Another 900,000 years passed, and he had also cultivated these two dimensions to the pinnacle of his current cultivation level.

He sensed for a while, and discovered that after nurturing four dimensions in his body, a great pressure was exerted on his physique. There was a limit to this. After reaching the limit, nurturing new dimensions would be a suicidal action.

However, four was far from his limit.

Ling Han went into seclusion once more. Another 8,000,000 years later, he had turned a total of 13 Powers of Dimension into real dimensions, and advanced them to medium-level dimensions.

This was his current limit.

“Now, what level can my battle prowess reach?”

...

Ling Han tore a rip into space, and entered the Void. If he were to train here, only then would it not cause any damage.

With a single thought, the 13 dimensions in his body were projected at the same time, turning into 13 projected dimensions, and exuding an incredibly terrifying pressure. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Go!” Ling Han shouted lightly, and sent out the projections of the 13 dimensions. He had blasted open a hole in the energy storm in the Void.

‘Very impressive!’ Even Ling Han himself was given a scare. ‘With the addition of the eighth-grade combination seals, would I be able to fight even a Sixth Tier elite?’

Very quickly, he shook his head. He should still fall a bit short of that.

‘However, what if I really go all out and truly blast out the 13 dimensions?’

Though these were only medium-level dimensions, when the whole dimension was thrown over, and there were 13 of them at that, then what kind of concept was that?
