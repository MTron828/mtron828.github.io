Chapter 2534: Advancement again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Alchemy was a very profitable business, especially for a high-level alchemist. Every time they were requested to concoct alchemical pills for others, they would demand an astonishingly exorbitant fee, and if they were to concoct alchemical pills themselves, they would put them on auction.

Ling Han wanted more to be requested to concoct alchemical pills for others, and demand great Celestial King Tier herbs as his fee. In that way, he would not need to concoct too many alchemical pills, and he would have enough ingredients to concoct a new Crimson Bright Fire Pill.

This time, he was trying to get the ball rolling.

As expected, after a few days, there was someone who established communication with him, asking him for help in concocting an alchemical pill.

It was only a single person, and there was no expected scene of an endless stream of people lining up to ask for his help. This was very normal. Who knew what Ling Han’s skill in alchemy was like? What if he wasted their ingredients, and they ended up with a failed concoction? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This first person had come because he was brave.

Ling Han only began pill concoction after several days of preparation. Very soon, he completed the pill concoction, and its grade was extremely high at that.

That person left in jubilant spirits. Once the news spread out, three people came at different times on the second day, requesting Ling Han’s help to concoct alchemical pills.

Ling Han began to get busy.

All Celestial Kings were extremely wealthy. The longer it had been since they became Celestial Kings, the more shocking amounts of wealth they naturally possessed, which caused Ling Han’s moneybag to begin to become fat.

He had a Celestial Physique of Time, and concocting a cauldron’s worth of Celestial King Tier pills would only be the matter of a few hours in real time, so the rate at which he was making money was naturally amazing.

Ling Han’s fame spread farther and farther, and more and more people came to request him to concoct alchemical pills. His pill completion rate was truly shocking, and as the number of alchemical pills he concocted increased, the grade of the completed pills was also steadily improving.

Everyone knew that an impressive alchemy king had appeared in the martial academy.

Three years later, Bewitching Maiden Rou came out of seclusion. She had successfully broken through to the Third Heaven.

When she knew that Ling Han had arrived, she was naturally overjoyed. And Little Terror also finally saw Ling Han. It immediately rushed over, and almost crushed Ling Han on the ground with a?bang.

The little guy’s power now was too frightening. Its cultivation level was Fifth Heaven, but its power had soared directly to the peak stage of the Sixth Heaven, which naturally caused even Ling Han to clench his teeth at the impact.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and picked Little Terror up.

“This little guy is becoming sturdier and sturdier. It should be very delicious.” The large black dog appeared, and drooled in Little Terror’s direction.

Why did he share the same temperament as Hu Niu?

“How much Divine Metal have you gotten?” Ling Han asked.

“Pei, do you think that Divine Metal is cheap vegetables, and can be gotten just anywhere?” the large black dog immediately cried out. “Grandpa Dog just came back for a breath of fresh air, okay?”

Ling Han’s expression was suspicious. “Have you gotten into some kind of mess, and have thus deliberately come back to avoid the trouble?”

The large black dog immediately changed the topic, his eyes shifting everywhere.

This damn dog was indeed not the type to behave, and would cause trouble everywhere. Thankfully, he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, or he would have long since been pummeled to death many times over by now.

He said a few words, and then left. It was possible that the trouble he had got into this time was not just small trouble.

Ling Han did not give him any further regard. He took out the Crimson Bright Fire Pills, and passed it to the Empress and Bewitching Maiden Rou. After three years, he had only managed to concoct three pills in total.

…It should be known that a single Crimson Bright Fire Pill was enough to make all Celestial Kings at Fifth Heaven and below fight each other over. He had concocted three of them in a period of three years; this was extremely shocking.

They ingested the pills, and began to digest its effects.

A great Celestial King Tier pill could only be digested very slowly.

A whole year later, Ling Han had finally completed digesting this great pill, and this was still because he had used time acceleration effects, or it would have needed at least around 1,000 years.

The advancement was very obvious. He had originally been in the early stage of the Third Heaven, and now he reached the late stage in a single stroke.

10 billion years of hard cultivation only resulted in such minor advancement?

In truth, the improvement via an alchemical pill would not take into account the acceleration of time. Taking into account Ling Han’s time acceleration effects of 1,000 times, a Crimson Bright Fire Pill had only saved him 10 million years of hard cultivation.

Hence, this kind of advancement was understandable.

“I cannot ingest another Crimson Bright Fire Pill in the short run.” As an alchemist himself, Ling Han was the most sensitive about the effects of an alchemical pill. There would be poison left behind by the alchemical pill, and a great problem would result if he ingested another Crimson Bright Fire Pill without waiting for this poison to be removed from his body.

He inspected carefully, and this poison was actually Regulations, but their level was very high. With his ability, he would not be able to remove them in a single stroke. They could only be removed in a slow, consistent process, so it would consume a lot of time.

Ling Han came out of seclusion, and the Empress came out very quickly soon after. She also had the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique, so her time acceleration effects were the same as Ling Han’s. However, it was much slower for Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Not long after, Ji Wuming came over to pay him a visit. At the first instant, he pronounced Ling Han’s true identity.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel gloomy. He had initially been confident that he could deceive everyone.

“Hehe, having such freakish talent in cultivation, and being a grandmaster alchemist at the same time, there are not many people like that,” Ji Wuming said. “Moreover, I did not believe that you would die so easily, so I simply guessed that it had to be you.”

Thankfully, Heavenborn had only battled with Ling Han once, and was not familiar with the latter. Otherwise, the former should have guessed that not only had Ling Han not died, he had also arrived in the martial academy already.

It was not only Ji Wuming. Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the others also came one after another. They all had guessed it. There was absolutely no way that Ling Han could have died in the Celestial Realm. They only had not known when he would arrive here.

There were also Ling Huo and the other manifestations of the Source Powers. They had come with the Empress and the others. Source Powers of heaven and earth naturally had excellent aptitude, so the rate of their cultivation was astonishing. All nine of them were already Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Yet, they had succeeded because they were Source Powers, but at the same time, it was also their weakness. It was practically impossible for them to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier as they were chained to the level of Regulations.

Their peaceful life was very soon interrupted because Xiao Yingxiong had come again.

“We battle again in the Nine Deaths Formation.” He issued a challenge.

Ling Han was surprised. Why had this guy come so quickly? Had he ingested some kind of natural treasure that caused his battle prowess to improve by leaps and bounds? Otherwise, how could he have such confidence?

“Sure.” Ling Han nodded. In a battle of equal level, he did not fear anyone.

“Three days later,” Xiao Yingxiong added.

The challenge this time soon alerted the entire martial academy. After all, they were both prodigies of the Battle Roll. Not only were the disciples of this present term all very interested, even a considerable number of people from the last term and the term before last decided that they would go and watch the battle.

Three days’ time passed very quickly. Ling Han walked towards the Nine Deaths Formation. After arriving, he couldn’t help but grit his teeth. There were too many people here, weren’t there? There was a complete sea of heads, and it was not just humans—there were also demi-humans, with tails or had the heads of goats, donkeys, and the like. All kinds of races were here.

The present Flaming Frost Realm had gathered all the prodigies of various races of the entire Genesis World. It was a complete wild mixture.

Xiao Yingxiong was already waiting for him. He was seated on the ground, while a sword was laid out on his legs, but the sword was not unsheathed, feeling like a dragon that was hidden in a valley, and as if it would be able to alarm the heavens the moment it appeared.

Seclusion could not allow the use of precious tools, but he was only using the Nine Deaths Formation to have a “fair” battle with Ling Han.

“You’re here!” Xiao Yingxiong said solemnly.

Ling Han smiled. “Is this the basis for your confidence?” He pointed at his sword.

“You will know when we battle.”

Ling Han chuckled, and walked into the great formation on the third level of the Nine Deaths Formation.

He would not become conceited. The only thing that differentiated them was that the other party had not cultivated Body Arts as well. In terms of pure power of Regulation, he was really not the slightest bit inferior in a battle of equal level, or would only have a slight disadvantage.

If they were to battle in the great formation of the fourth level, his disadvantage would be too great.

Xiao Yingxiong also walked in, and faced Ling Han directly.

“Not making your move?” Ling Han was surprised.

Xiao Yingxiong brandished his sword casually, and did not even unsheath it. Then, he said, “I have.”

Ling Han chuckled. “Looks like asking for a spar is a lie, and you have another motive, right?”
