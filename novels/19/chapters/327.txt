Chapter 328: Analysis

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Sword light filled the whole sky!

This ultimate move’s power far surpassed Ling Han’s tier—even a king like the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf didn’t dare to be careless. All of its hair stood up as a flashes of lightning shot out at the same time from its nine eyes, combining into one and forming a thick electric arc that fired towards Ling Han.

To catch bandits, catch the ringleader; If Ling Han was annihilated, then this move’s power would naturally disperse on its own.

The lightning was also Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf’s ultimate move.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, sword lights decreased in size, greeting the lightning. Pa, pa, pa, the sword lights were annihilated one after another, but at the same time, the lightning shrunk at a rapid pace.

Each sword light was equivalent to Ling Han’s full-strength attack, and although it wasn’t enough to battle Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf’s full-strength attack head on, there were still many sword lights. With each sword light striking it, the lightning finally became as thin as a spider’s thread, completely disappearing at last.

At this time, only three hundred sword lights remained.

Hong!

The Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf had already fired its ultimate move, so it couldn’t possibly follow up with another one. It could only use its claws to guard its head. Three hundred sword lights struck, and the fierce clashes instantly produced flashes of blinding light.

Ling Han slumped onto the ground. He truly gave it his all with the strike just now, directly drawing out all the Origin Power inside his body. If this couldn’t kill the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf, then he could only hide inside the Black Tower, wait for his Origin Power to recover, and then find this beast king again.

Fortunately, the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf lay on the ground with fresh blood gushing out continuously; its chest was slightly moving up and down, signaling that it was still alive.

Kickass—it received the Mysterious Three Thousand head on and was only heavily injured.

Ling Han was deeply moved, but an intense fear arose in him toward the the Heaven’s Sword Sect. Just what sort of force was it for it to possess such a terrifying ultimate move... too shocking. Even with his Heaven Tier experience, it was still very hard to use this sword art. Moreover, this sword art’s power was linked to Sword Qi, and not everyone could cultivate it to such a terrifying degree.

Previously, when Ling Han pushed out seven hundred sword lights, he already guessed that the Mysterious Three Thousand’s extreme should be at Sword Qi’s consummation. Theoretically, a martial artist could cultivate to form ten flashes of Sword Qi, but there were still geniuses that cultivated eleven or twelve flashes. So, if one flash of Sword Qi could evolve into one hundred sword lights, then theoretically, one could cultivate twenty-nine flashes of Sword Qi, making up the three thousand.

The first form was Sword Qi, so Sword Ray should initiate the second form.

Sword Ray was Sword Qi extrapolating in this way, the third form Breaking Limits could only be used when one grasped sword heart.

The third form corresponded to three different stages in way of the sword.

That the Heaven’s Sword Sect could stand erect for ten millennia without collapsing was expectedly not without reason.

“Senior Brother Jian Cheng, the battle ahead suddenly stopped. Could they have battled it out?” A voice drifted over from afar.

“Hehe, battling so fiercely, we must go see just who it is!” Another voice sounded. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

‘Sh!t.’ Ling Han hurriedly collected his thoughts and struggled to climb up. He only expended all his Origin Power, his physical stamina was still preserved. He walked staggeringly to the side of the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf, picked it up, and with a thought, xiu , he entered the Black Tower.

In an instant later, two figures arrived immediately at the same time.

It was two youngsters, only twenty-four or twenty-five years old, both looking handsome, confident, and out of this world. As for their cultivation, one was at the seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, and the other was shockingly at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier.

“Huh, how come there’s no sign of anyone?” the purpled-clothed youngster said.

The other youngster that wore a blue garment lowered his gaze, looking at the traces left from the battle, and said, “The battle just now was not between two people, but between a person and a beast.”

“Senior Brother Jian Cheng, how so?” the purple-clothed person asked.

The blue garment youngster let out a smothered laugh and said, “There’re claw marks everywhere, can’t Junior Brother Yue tell?”

The purple-clothed person laughed too, and refuted, “Couldn’t it possibly be one person who used a claw-type weapon?”

“It’s certainly possible!” The youngster in the blue garment nodded. He then pointed to the ground and said, “However, there are still several footprints here, enough to prove that one side was a beast.”

“Couldn’t it be possible that two people battled, and one brought their pet beast?” The purple-clothed person seemed to like nitpicking.

The youngster in the blue garment laughed and said, “The footprints that belong to a human look exactly the same, don’t you tell me that the two people were wearing the exact same shoes and their sizes are exactly the same.”

Under this rebuke, the purple-clothed person paused, then muttered, “Could it not be possible?”

This seemed to be his favorite expression.

“From the traces of destruction, the battle prowess of the person and the beast were quite astonishing.” The youngster in the blue garment no longer spoke sarcastically to his companion, and looked at the battle traces seriously. He revealed a stern expression and said, “This battle prowess is at least nine stars.”

“Nine Stars?” The purple-clothed person was slightly shocked, and said, “Senior Brother Jian Cheng, not to mention the people in the current exam, there aren’t many Spiritual Ocean Tier practitioners that possess nine star battle prowess even in our Winter Moon Sect.”

The youngster in blue garment nodded and said, “There certainly aren’t many, but not too few either, at least several hundred. Who exactly was it that came here to battle with a beast? Huh, this blood!” He revealed a shocked expression. There were large amounts of blood left by the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf, which the traces had glowing crimson-colored lines of fabric in them. As the blood itself was red, if one didn’t examine them closely, one would really overlook it.

He thought of a possibility and cried out abruptly, “The Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf!”

“What?!” The purple-clothed person also revealed a shocked expression. “I certainly heard that there was a Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf roaming around here, but the Spiritual Pedestal Tier experts have searched for it and even Flower Blossom Tiers swept over with their awareness, but they all found nothing at all.”

“It should be it, this blood can’t deceive me!” the youngster in the blue garment said, revealing a smile at the corner of his lips. “Interesting, interesting, one who could battle so fiercely with the Nine-Eyed Beast Wolf... such a person is a worthy opponent.”

“Hahaha, even you as one of the seven sons of the Ao Family feel the urge to battle?” The purple-clothed person laughed loudly.

The youngster in the blue garment, Ao Jian Cheng revealed an arrogant expression and said, “What’s so interesting about bullying the weak. If I battle, I’ll battle geniuses—only stepping on geniuses is pleasurable enough.”

“Hahaha, Senior Brother Jian Cheng, the one I’m most impressed with amongst the seven sons of the Ao Family is you, and that is precisely because you possess a strong cultivator’s desire for battle,” the purple-clothed person said.

Ao Jian Cheng smiled faintly, but the arrogance in his expression didn’t disappear as he said, “Let’s go, there’s nothing left to see here.”

The two came quickly and left quickly.

Inside the Black Tower, Ling Han revealed a hostile expression—this guy was actually Ao Feng’s son.
