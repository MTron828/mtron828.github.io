Chapter 2295: Holy Mountain

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others pondered for a moment before hurriedly running over to follow Ling Han.

Ling Han was far too powerful, and his mind was also extremely nimble. They couldn’t go wrong if they followed him.

Ling Han didn’t stop them, either. Even though he detested the people of the Foreign Realm, those who invaded the Celestial Realm all belonged to the Demon Race. Not a single one of them belonged to the Angel Race. Thus, it was extremely difficult for him to hate them.

In any case, the Angel Race was battling against the Dark Inverse Realm on the other side of the Foreign Realm, so Ling Han naturally wished that they were as powerful as could be. Otherwise, if the Dark Inverse Realm conquered the Foreign Realm, the next in line to fall would be the Celestial Realm.

Because of this, he decided to give Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others a hand. He would bring them out of this place.

The invading claws of the Foreign Realm needed to be severed. However, the armor that defended them needed to be reinforced. They needed to hold back the invading Dark Inverse Realm.

They ventured into the distance, coming across several other tribes in the process. However, they passed these areas peacefully, not triggering any conflict.

After a dozen or so days, a large mountain appeared in their vision. It was golden-yellow, and it was much like a mountain that had been created from gold.

“This is the Holy Mountain,” they all said.

According to the information provided by the tribespeople, this was the holy mountain, From the outside, it looked like a mountain that had been forged from gold. However, when they ascended it, it would appear no different from ordinary mountains. For some strange reason, however, it would always

look like a golden mountain from afar.

From this point on, their journey would start to become dangerous.

“According to the tribespeople, powerful beasts wander around the foot of the mountain, hunting those who come to ascend the mountain.”

“In fact, the most powerful beast can rival those at the Ninth Lotus! If we come across one, we won’t even have the opportunity to flee.”

“We must be extremely careful.”

They quietly chattered among themselves. This place was far too dangerous, and the wild beasts more so wouldn’t give a toss about their backgrounds. Regardless of whether they were the successor of a large clan or a student of the Hundred Battles Academy, they would be eaten if they were caught.

Here, staying alive was their top priority.

Ling Han was slightly more confident. Even though his cultivation had been suppressed, his Divine Demon Sword had already advanced to the level of Divine Metal. Even though it still had yet to reach the level of Celestial Tool, the domineering nature of its Sword Qi could already threaten those at the

Ascending Origin Tier.

Of course, the prerequisite to this was that Ling Han had an opportunity to launch an attack. Otherwise, if an Ascending Origin Tier elite killed him with a single thought, everything would be for naught.

In this place, metals were a rare commodity. However, they did still exist. Thus, tribespeople would enter the Holy Mountain every year, transforming ordinary pieces of armor into treasured tools, However, the probability of being killed was also extremely high.

As such, it wasn’t strange to see pieces of armor littering the ground. This was a common sight. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Of course, these billets would also be picked up by others. They wouldn’t stay on the ground forever.

Ling Han and the others saw several armor billets as they walked toward the Holy Mountain. This was a physical reminder of the cruel reality of this place. People were dying all the time.

Crackle!

A strange sound ripped through the air, and they looked over to see a gigantic insect appear. Its body was pitch-black and covered in a layer of solid armor that reflected a metallic glow. A lotus bloomed on its back, showing seven petals and four leaves.

It flapped its cicada-like wings, and it was this that caused the strange sound.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others all wore anxious expressions. This insect was extremely powerful, far exceeding the limits of their battle prowess. They all retrieved their precious armor, yet they still felt a complete lack of confidence.

The gulf between them was simply too great.

Ling Han strode forward. His suit of armor significantly boosted his battle prowess, allowing him to rival those at the Fourth Leaf of the Seventh Lotus.

“Brother Ba, don’t be reckless!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly shouted in warning, She wasn’t worried about Ling Han per se, but rather worried that they would lose their key to leaving this place.

The others all nodded in agreement. Against a powerful insect like this, fleeing was naturally the best course of action. According to the tribespeople, the Holy Mountain was a forbidden area for the Insect Race and the Holy Beasts. Not a single one of them dared to enter.

Thus, they would be safe as long as they fled onto the mountain.

“Don’t worry, Niu’s… is the strongest! He can definitely defeat this ugly insect!” Hu Niu was filled with confidence. Fortunately, she had finally become a little smarter, and she didn’t directly call Ling Han’s name.

No one believed her. Those at the Fifth Leaf of the Sixth Lotus possessed a battle prowess around the First Leaf of the Seventh Lotus. The gulf between this and the Fourth Leaf was far too great. It would be a miracle if Ling Han could win.

Crackle!

The gigantic insect fluttered its wings as it swooped down at Ling Han. Just the turbulence caused by its flapping wings was already terrifying, with the surrounding air transforming into blades of wind that slashed at Ling Han.

Ling Han roared as he threw a fist, with his attack instantly transforming into a giant hammer.

Clang, clang, clang!

The blades of wind were obliterated. The hammer then raced toward the insect at an incredible speed.

Everyone was shocked by this sight. They knew that Ling Han was powerful as he possessed the ability to defeat a monarch tier at the same cultivation level ina single strike. This placed his true battle prowess at the Second Leaf or even the Third Leaf of the Seventh Lotus. However, one’s freakish power

needed to have a limit, right? After all, his cultivation level was clear for all to see. He still had yet to reach the Seventh Lotus.

However, Ling Han’s attack instantly provided them with boundless delight. He could easily rival the attacks of those at the Fourth leaf of the Seventh Lotus.

They gazed at Ling Han’s suit of armor, which was fully glowing at this moment. Even though it couldn’t be considered as a genuine set, it still made Ling Han appear extremely domineering and mighty at this moment.

“Hmm…? Perhaps this is…?!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s expression instantly became animated.

“Talso have the same thought!” a monarch tier said. His eyebrows jiggled, and it was as if he were about to start dancing.

“The Dark Inverse Realm’s armor!” several people exclaimed in unison.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s face flushed red with excitement, and she was beside herself with delight. “The rough billets can transform into battle armor after being placed on the Holy Mountain. Judging from this, this Holy Mountain definitely has links to the Dark Inverse Realm!

“We’ve always wanted to discover the secret behind the Dark Inverse Realm’s armor. If we can obtain this secret, our overall battle prowess will rise by a significant amount. At that time, resisting the Dark Inverse Realm will be no problem, and conquering the Celestial Realm will also be far easier than

anticipated.

“In fact, we might even be able to launch a counterattack against the Dark Inverse Realm. After fusing the two dimensions together, even if we don’t become a medium-level dimension, we can still at least rise to the top of the low-level dimensions.

“Even though we’ve killed several elites from the Dark Inverse Realm at the border, once they die, their armor also self-destructs. As such, we’ve never been able to discover the secrets behind their armor.

“Perhaps… this is a chance!”

They were all filled with excitement. If they truly managed to bring a flawless suit of armor back, they would have made a massive contribution to the Foreign Realm. Perhaps even Heavenly Venerates would come to commend them.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Meanwhile, Ling Han was still battling against the giant insect. Even though his battle prowess was extremely impressive, the giant insect’s shell was a natural layer of armor. It was incredibly hard, and even Ling Han’s full-power attacks could only leave some dents. However, these dents would quickly

recover, and it was as if the insect wasn’t being affected at all.

As the battle dragged on, Ling Han also discovered that he was becoming increasingly hungry. It was as if his strength had been exhausted, and he was overcome by a feeling of fatigue.

This was the peculiar suppression of this heaven and earth. Living beings all had to consume food. Otherwise, they would feel fatigued and exhausted.

On the other hand, this giant insect had clearly become familiar with this peculiar environment, so its endurance was far greater than that of Ling Han.

If this continued, Ling Han would lose!

The excitement was wiped off everyone’s face. If the situation didn’t improve, they would all die here.

“Hurry up and ascend the mountain!” they said with urgency. Since Ling Han could still rival the giant insect, they needed to seize this opportunity to climb the mountain. Otherwise, they would face certain death.

Ling Han shook his head. He then retrieved the Divine Demon Sword..
