Chapter 1798: Coincidence

Celestial King Tier force!

Celestial King Tiers were the paramount elites of the Celestial Realm, and Celestial King Tier forces were the most powerful forces in the entire world. Who could rival such juggernaut forces?

Fu Shenbing and the other elites almost wet their pants in fright, and their heads were completely numb with apprehension.

No wonder the female knight was so powerful! As it turned out, she was an elite from a Celestial King Tier force!

They were both at the fifth secret, yet the female knight was practicing a Celestial King Tier technique. As such, it was only natural that her battle prowess was far superior to his.

Gasp!

Who in the world was Ling Han? He actually had links to a Celestial King Tier force? They were almost certain that Ling Han hadn’t offended the Roc Palace. After all, they were separated by the boundless seas, so how could a measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivator offend them?

Moreover, that was a Celestial King Tier force! Even if Ling Han were 100 times more audacious, would he dare to offend them?

However, they had clearly underestimated Ling Han’s tendency to cause trouble. At this moment, he had already offended the Zihe Clan.

“Where is the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm located?” the female knight asked in extreme impatience.

Fu Shenbing hurriedly and respectfully told her the location of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Before an elite from a Celestial King Tier force, he didn’t dare to act arrogantly at all.

The female knight couldn’t care less about Fu Shenbing’s obsequious attitude, and she immediately patted her Dragonhawk, commanding it to turn around and instantly soar into the distance.

The 10 female knights behind her quickly patted their Dragonhawks and followed her lead.

Only when these female knights vanished into the distance did Fu Shenbing breathe a sigh of relief. He was drenched in cold sweat.

The female knight had shown no hesitation to kill, and she more so had the support of a powerful Celestial King Tier force. As such, she could act as wantonly as she wanted.

Fu Shenbing pondered for a moment before saying, “Dongxue, go to the Han Clan to explain the situation to them.” The female knight could pat her hands and leave, yet the Fu Clan still had to deal with the aftermath.

“Old ancestor...” Fu Dongxue shuffled over, and whispered, “I looked into Ling Han just then, and this brat is truly a big troublemaker. He went to Dark Moon City not long ago, and he destroyed a Severing Mundane Tier force. While he was at Black Moon City, he also became enemies with the Xiao Clan, a two-star force. Not only that, but there’s also great animosity between him and Bei Xuanming, the Holy Son of the Lunar Sect.”

Fu Shenbing frowned upon hearing this, and he said, “Send someone to the Xiao Clan and tell them to behave themselves... Crap, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm!”

The Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm had already opened, so what would happen if someone from the Lunar Sect killed Ling Han? The Roc Palace would definitely become infuriated, so what would they do at that time? If the Roc Palace were reasonable, they would still be able to watch on as outsiders. However, if the Roc Palace were unreasonable, what would they do if the Roc Palace decided to destroy them as an offering for Ling Han?

More frighteningly, Fu Gaoyun had an extremely close relationship with Ling Han. As such, his three fellow potential successors were definitely extremely jealous of him. After entering the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, how could they not seize the opportunity to kill Ling Han?

Gasp!

If Ling Han were killed by a member of the Fu Clan... the Fu Clan would definitely be done for!

“Hurry, send more people into the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm! Tell them what’s happened, and have them protect Ling Han at all costs!”

Fu Dongxue hurriedly nodded, and replied, “Understood!”

If Fu Shenbing knew that Ling Han had already offended another Celestial King Tier force, just what kind of expression would he wear? Would he still insist on protecting him at all costs?

He would definitely be as hesitant as could be.

Ling Han was far too much of a troublemaker!

***

Inside the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm.

Upon entering, one would be met with an expanse of suffusing mist. This mist was harmless, yet it would completely obstruct one’s sight and divine sense. It was as if they had gone completely blind. After walking for 30 or so minutes, however, this mist would gradually dissipate, and allow them to more clearly see their surroundings.

This was a large plain that was covered in grass that reached one’s waist. This was a land that was filled with life and vitality, and as the gentle breeze blew by, the tall grass would undulate like a stretch of green waves. It was a spectacular sight.

Many cultivators were sprinting forward at an incredible speed, and they quickly disappeared into the distance.

A fiery current swirled through the land, and it radiated with a sour and sulphuric smell. Far away in the distance, one could also see a colossal mountain that towered into the clouds. Mist gently rolled off the mountain.

In fact, this mountain was the volcano that unleashed lava into the surroundings, and suppressed the violent aura of the mystery realm. However, the lava would transform the surrounding land into a scorching sea of heat, so the cultivators had to rely on their Blood Dragon Armor to survive. Otherwise, they would be instantly incinerated into ashes by the powerful Regulations of Flames.

According to rumors, Dividing Soul Tier elites could rely on their own abilities to wander around the outer regions of the plain. Elites at the Immortal Palace Tier could venture further in, yet they were still unable to reach the depths of the plain. Moreover, the more powerful one was, the more easily they would trigger a backlash from the violent aura of the mystery realm.

After all, the violent aura had only been suppressed, not dissolved.

As such, this mystery realm had become a place for Severing Mundane Tier cultivators to explore and adventure.

“Hmm?” Ling Han was slightly astonished. He discovered that the origin flames in his body were churning around, and it was as if they were extremely... intimate with the scorching heat waves in the surroundings.

“I have a feeling that these heat waves can’t injure me,” Ling Han said. He decided to remove his Blood Dragon Armor. Otherwise, the heat waves would be kept a foot from his body. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Be careful!” the Empress hurriedly said in warning.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Rest assured, I know what I’m doing.”

He slowly removed his Blood Dragon Armor, and the heat waves in the surroundings instantly surged toward him like thirsty horses that had seen an oasis. They transformed into countless slithering fire snakes, and it was as if they were about to refine his body. Right at this moment, however, a supremely domineering aura radiated from Ling Han’s body, and it was as if he were a high and mighty ruler.

This was the Nine Heavens Flame.

The fire snakes instantly calmed down, and they started to slowly encircle his body. In fact, they even bowed slightly, and it was as if they were paying respects to their ruler.

“It can’t be that coincidental, right?” Ling Han exclaimed in astonishment.

The Empress also came to a realization, and she said, “Perhaps this Celestial King Tier force was the one that created the Flame Control Technique? And perhaps they were also the previous owner of the Nine Heavens Flame?”

“Almost certainly. Otherwise, this reaction can’t be explained,” Ling Han said with a nod. Although he possessed an ancestral flame, Regulations of Flames that were more powerful than him could still threaten and wound him.

The flames in this mystery realm were so powerful that even Ascending Origin Tier elites needed to exert their full power to resist their might. Even so, they were still restricted to only wandering around the outer regions of the plain. Judging from this, one could imagine just how powerful the flames in this mystery realm were.

As such, there could only be one explanation for why they didn’t harm Ling Han.

“There seems to be an intangible will of the heavens,” Ling Han said. “I obtained the Nine Heavens Flame first, and I then obtained the Flame Control Technique from Bewitching Maiden Rou. Now, I’ve even entered the den of that Celestial King. This is truly an amazing coincidence.”

The Empress nodded upon hearing this. She was also feeling respect and apprehension toward the intangible will of the heavens.

Was there truly an intangible power that lay transcendent above all matter?

“Since we’ve already entered, there’s no point pondering this anymore. Let’s look around and hope we find some treasures,” Ling Han said. He was extremely eager to advance to the third severance as doing so would allow him to kill Zihe Bingyun.

The Empress gently nodded in understanding. Anyhow, she would be happy as long as she was by Ling Han’s side.

Although they had an extra suit of Blood Dragon Armor now, Ling Han still didn’t let the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden into the mystery realm. Her cultivation level was far too low, so even the Blood Dragon Armor wouldn’t be enough to help her resist the scorching heat of this mystery realm. If she insisted on entering, she would definitely suffer a fate of death.

Ling Han and the Empress continued to advance. As they did so, they didn’t forget to search for Blood Dragon Stones. These were materials that could allow them to advance at an explosive speed. However, Blood Dragon Stones were extremely difficult to find, and it was completely up to luck whether they could come across them or not.

Ling Han’s luck had always been decent, so it wasn’t long before they came across a shiny red object. Picking it up, they discovered that it was indeed a Blood Dragon Stone.

As its name suggested, this was a blood-red stone.

“Huh?” Ling Han suddenly exclaimed in surprise. His Nine Heavens Flame suddenly wavered, causing the Blood Dragon Stone to instantly disintegrate and turn into ashes. At the same time, the essence within the Blood Dragon Stone was completely absorbed into his body.
