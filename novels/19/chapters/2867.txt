2868 Killing Them All

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was running out of Great Herbs.

There were only seven leaves on this Great Herb, and he had finished every one of them. He had to resort to eating the stem now. Even though the effectiveness was not any weaker compared to the leaves, he could only get seven to eight bites of it.

A sense of doubt rose in the Highest North Heavenly Venerate’s mind. Could he endure until the end of Ling Han’s power burst?

He definitely could.

!!

He pushed the negative emotions to the back of his mind as quickly as they came up.

How could one who could become a Heavenly Venerate not have this much toughness?

With the exception of a never-before-seen prodigy like Xin Qihu, everyone had to encounter tons of setbacks and pitfalls on their path to becoming a Heavenly Venerate. If he hadn’t had at least this much tenacity, he would have long perished on his journey to becoming a Heavenly Venerate.

He tried his best to hold on, relentlessly swallowing the Great Herb while calculating the time.

One hour, one and a half hours, two hours!

He revealed an expression of joy. He could still barely use the Great Herb in his hand one more time, while Ling Han’s burst of power had ended.

‘Hahaha! Brat, it’s your turn to suffer!’

The Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate also displayed a cold smile filled with killing intent. Ling Han was already at his limit. This time, it was their turn to beat the sh!t out of this brat.

Ling Han did not falter. Boom! An even more shocking power erupted from his body, raising his battle prowess by yet another level.

“What?! Another combination seal?!” The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was shocked. Ling Han’s skull, pelvis, arms, and legs were shining with the light of a seal. This was definitely another combination seal.

This time, the Highest North had the urge to vomit blood literally. A sense of despair crept up inside him.

Heavenly Venerable Seals were rare beyond compare. Barring the seven more widely known seals, trying to obtain even one of them was incredibly difficult. And if even getting one of them was this hard, what more of obtaining such a combination seal?

However, not only did Ling Han have combination seals, he also had more than one set.

Knowing this, how could the Highest North Heavenly Venerable not want to vomit blood? How could he not despair?

How could he possibly hold on?

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was a tough man, but the Great Herb in his hands was completely spent. It was impossible to make bricks without straws; how was he supposed to endure any longer?

He took his final portion of the Great Herb, and then roared as he launched a desperate attack.

As a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, he was not short of decisiveness. Since there was no path to retreat, he had to kill his way out.

He aggressively pressed forward, turning defense into offense. Only by pushing Ling Han back, or at the very least making him ease up on his attacks, would he have the chance to regroup with the Gray Space Heavenly Venerate and the rest.

For the sake of survival, he gave it his all.

Ling Han had a calm look on his face. Why would he give the tiger a chance to return to the mountains?

‘Kill!’

He continued with his fierce onslaught. Using the astonishing power of the Four Directions Seals, he sent the Highest North Heavenly Venerate flying into the distance with a single punch, not showing any signs of stopping at all.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was truly in despair. He could feel the organs inside his body seething. They were close to bursting.

How strong was the body of a Heavenly Venerate? It was tempered with the fundamental powers of the Genesis World, and was many times stronger than Divine Metal. Each ascension brought it closer in strength to the level of a Heavenly Venerate Tool.

But now, he was being beaten into submission by Ling Han.

He was frustrated, enraged, and indignant. However, there was nothing he could do to turn this unfavorable, losing situation around.

His chances of survival were slim.

A cold glint flashed in Ling Han’s eyes. Peng! He struck out with his fist, straight into the Highest North Heavenly Venerate’s temple, directly blowing this Heavenly Venerate’s mind to bits.

So what if he was a Heavenly Venerate? Unless he managed to release his spirit ahead of time, a complete destruction of his mind would result in absolute death.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate had died!

At that moment, the Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate and the rest stopped in their tracks.

The Highest North Heavenly Venerate was famous as them, and their strength was more or less the same. They had fought, both on the same side and on opposing ends, for many epochs. But now, the Highest North Heavenly Venerate had been killed right before their eyes. They didn’t even have the chance to save him.

This gave them chills down their spine, and they felt a sense of nervousness from the depths of their soul.

Would they also meet a similar end?

However, no Heavenly Venerate was that fragile. The four of them immediately rekindled their fighting spirit, and charged at Ling Han.

Ling Han did not shy away from the challenge, and met the four of them head-on.

‘Is this brat courting death?’

The Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate and the rest didn’t understand, but they did not care, either. All they wanted… was Ling Han’s death.

‘Kill, kill, kill!’

Just as their attacks were about to land, Ling Han revealed a mysterious smile. With a wave of his right hand, he threw out the thing hanging on his back. As the stone sheath unwrapped itself, a broken saber was revealed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Weng! Immediately, a terrifying, murderous aura surged forth.

“What?!”

“Not good!”

The Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate and the rest were shocked. As they were assaulted by this wave of murderous aura, their battle prowess instantly fell. They had to focus a lot of their effort to resist it. Otherwise, they might not even be able to stand firm.

Ling Han chuckled, and then launched his attack.

Naturally, he was already mentally prepared before he threw out this broken saber. Furthermore, his body harbored millions and millions of Powers of Dimension, making him incredibly resistant to oppressive auras. He had discovered this fact back when he opened the stone, but he had intentionally put on a ruse to hide his true abilities.

He hadn’t been thinking too hard about it back then. He simply hadn’t wanted to reveal his strength. Little had he known, it had resulted in him successfully trapping the Four Great Heavenly Venerates.

Peng! He crushed the Six Heavens Heavenly Venerate’s skull with a single punch. Then, as he turned around, he smashed the Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate’s skull in with his knee, utterly destroying the latter’s mind in the process.

...

He wasn’t done yet. He retracted his hand and leg, and then struck out again with both simultaneously.

Peng! Peng! Both the Four Sides Heavenly Venerate’s and Gray Space Heavenly Venerate’s skull were smashed.

Ling Han wasn’t intentionally trying to make things so bloody, but he didn’t have a choice. A Heavenly Venerate could only be killed by destroying their mind.

Shua! He wrapped the broken saber back in the layers of stone. Even though he had a strong resistance to the murderous aura emitted by this broken saber, he still felt some of its effects. It was just that he could withstand it better than a normal Fourth Tier.

His movements were very practiced—throwing out the saber, killing, and then cleaning up, all in a single breath. As Ling Han finished, Yue Chengwang was in such shock that he stood up from his chair, his face twitching uncontrollably.

Heavenly Venerates were individuals that wouldn’t even balk at the destruction of an entire realm. However, the scene before him was simply too shocking. Five Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates practically perished in an instant. How could he possibly accept such a thing? How could he possibly remain calm?

Ling Han looked at Yue Chengwang silently.

Yue Chengwang couldn’t stop himself from gulping, as he felt sweat dripping from his forehead.

He could sense the pressure of death coming down on him, but under Ling Han’s stoic gaze, he didn’t dare move a single muscle. Otherwise, he would surely fall on the receiving end of Ling Han’s swift attacks, and end up the same way as those five Heavenly Venerates.

“Ling Han, my father is a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate. It’s not too late for you to cease and desist!” he warned Ling Han.

He felt great shame to the point of wanting to kill himself as the words left his mouth.

...

He was still a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, an all-powerful existence in any medium-level dimension. Even in the Flaming Frost Realm, he would stand amongst the strongest of elites. But now, he was forced to use his father’s name to try and scare someone else just so that he would have a chance to survive.

Shameful. It was much too shameful.

Ling Han walked towards Yue Chengwang, and casually said, “Sure, I don’t mind sparing your pitiful life.”

Yue Chengwang felt a sense of relief, despite being utterly displeased with how Ling Han had called him pitiful.

However, before he even had a chance to fully process it all, he saw Ling Han’s iron fist coming straight for him. Peng! His head was instantly crushed.
