Chapter 3371: Young Master Cat

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

After exchanging a few words with Jin Sanyin, Ling Han bade farewell and left.

The other party expressed that if Ling Han still needed anything else in this aspect, he could continue to look for him. The Jin Clan specialized in the material business, and basically, as long as Ling Han could name it, they would be able to obtain it.

Of course, the prerequisite was that Ling Han could afford it.

Although Ling Han had left, Jin Sanyin had not. He was still drinking tea in the private room, looking extremely relaxed.

The door suddenly opened and a young man in his twenties walked in.

“Ninth Grandpa, isn’t it too much of a loss to sell it to him at such a low price?”

The young man sat down and asked the old man.

Jin Sanyin smiled slightly and said, “This young man is very outstanding. I think very highly of his future, so I’ll treat this as forming a good relationship with him. Perhaps there will be a time when we would have to ask a favor from him in the future.”

“Why would our Jin Clan need his help?” The young man expressed his dissatisfaction and said proudly, “If it wasn’t for the fact that we wanted to keep a low profile, how could the Chen Clan become the rulers of this empire?”

Jin Sanyin’s expression changed. “Shaojian, you’re too arrogant. The Chen Clan isn’t as simple as you think!”

However, Jin Shaojian was still unconvinced, and he said, “Ninth Grandpa, you’ve been deceived by the rumors. What flying rat? How can this environment of heaven and earth give birth to a Core Formation Tier elite?”

Jin Sanyin nodded slowly. “Indeed. At this stage, no matter how talented one is, it’s impossible for him to leap through the Celestial Gate. Chen Fengyan is at most at the Mystery Realm Tier.”

-Our Jin Clan has three Mystery Realm Tier elites. If we work together, Chen Fengyan will definitely be beaten until he can’t find his bearings!” Jin Shaojian said with a smile, then flattered Jin Sanyin. “Ninth Grandfather is only a hair’s breadth away from the Mystery Realm Tier. As long as you advance into the Mystery Realm Tier, with Ninth Grandfather’s natural talent in martial arts, you alone will be enough to suppress Chen Fengyan.”

Jin Sanyin couldn’t help but laugh out loud. This flattery made him feel very pleased.

He waved his hand and said, “Remember the ancestral teachings. Back then, we had to keep a low enough profile to escape a calamity. Now that heaven and earth have just begun to flourish, it is the time for our Jin Clan to rise. We must seize this opportunity.”

“Yes,” Jin Shaojian replied respectfully. However, he had never understood why the Jin Clan still wanted to keep a low profile when the Dao of Heaven and Earth was recovering. Shouldn’t they take the opportunity to seize the world?

He had already asked about this several times, but he had never received a definite answer. After asking too many times, he could not be bothered to waste further time on asking about this.

His eyes flickered. What right did a mere Blood Transformation Tier cultivator have to receive such high regard from his ninth grandfather?

Hmph!

After Ling Han returned to the academy, he received a message from the academy. His application had been approved, and the academy had already prepared a larger courtyard for him.

He happily brought the children over. As expected, this courtyard was much larger. It could even be said to be a small manor.

It was unknown if his identity as a High Level alchemist or Formation Master had taken effect, or if it was because he had won first place in the Hunting Competition, but the academy also wanted to use this opportunity to reward

him.

Forget it, forget it. Ling Han began to create formation foundations.

He bought two kinds of materials. One was Dark Jade Iron. According to his request, it was cut into 33 thin rods. This was used to make the Vajra Formation. The other was a cloth woven from Dark Silk and Golden Scale Silk.

This was used to make the Precipice Formation.

The Vajra Formation was easy to create. As long as one bought the corresponding ink, it would be more expensive, but since it could be resolved with money, it was not difficult. What was difficult was the Precipice Formation. At the very least, one would need the blood of an Inscription Tier to make the ink.

Where was he going to find an Inscription Tier cultivator to extract blood from?

Forget it, I’ll create the Vajra Formation first.

He was creating the formation foundations very quickly; he could make seven in a day, and that meant he could finish it in five days at most.

Other than creating formation foundations, Ling Han’s focus was all on breaking through to the Sixth Change.

He was not worried about his foundations. With Second Baby’s eye technique, she could point out the shortcomings in his cultivation one by one. He had long reached perfection. The difficult part was how to break through to Sixth

Change.

This was a breakthrough of his limits. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han had been pondering this question ever since he had returned from the Eternal Moon Ancient Site. However, added with the few days that he had returned, it had been a long time and he still had no clue at all.

This was very normal. How could it be so easy to break through the limit? If Ling Han didn’t know that there was still a Sixth Change, he would definitely muddle-headedly attempt to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier, he thought to himself. Even if he reached Sixth Change, he would still need to spend a lot of time to stabilize his foundations, and only attempt to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier after confirming that there wasn’t any

Seventh Change.

This was because it was the ancients who had concluded that there wasn’t any Seventh Change. It wasn’t like the Dao of Heaven and Earth had said that Sixth Change was the true end, and it was impossible to advance any further.

But it wasn’t quiet outside.

Chen Fengyan was still in seclusion, and Hong Tianbu had gone on an expedition. The few elder princes seemed to have disappeared all of a sudden. No one could restrain the envoys from the Demon Race this time, and it

created a grat commotion.

To the Demon Race, they were here to take revenge this time. They naturally did not have any scruples.

Now, even the Imperial Capital Academy was no longer a paradise. That Young Master Cat would come to the academy every other day to challenge Ling Han, and if he couldn’t find the actual person, he would randomly beat someone up.

The cultivation of Extreme Bone Tier was already at the top level in the academy, and this Young Master Cat was even more so a super genius. His battle prowess could match that of Inscription Tier, so who in this academy could contend with him?

In just these few days, many people in the academy had already been injured by him. This caused the academy’s disciples to be filled with resentment towards Young Master Cat, but also with dissatisfaction towards Ling Han.

You were the one who caused this trouble, but now, you have gone into hiding somewhere, and it was them that was bearing the consequences.

In reality, Ling Han was also very innocent, because he had no intention of hiding his tracks. However, Young Master Cat refused to go to his place no matter what, so what could he do?

It was only until this time, when Ling Han changed his residence, the news of his return naturally spread.

The next day, Young Master Cat charged over.

Since the identity of the Demon Race had been exposed, the demons who came this time did not cover themselves with cloaks. Instead, they walked out

openly.

Young Master Cat really lived up to his name. He was a cat demon with a furry cat face. His eyes were abnormally bright and had a terrifying brilliance.

His cultivation had reached Fourth Extreme, and his battle prowess had advanced into the Inscription Tier. He was a top prodigy even among the

Demon Race.

He had come alone, and the people from the Imperial Capital did not dare to ambush him either. Otherwise, be it the Fourth Prince or Yuwen Hou, they would cause a calamity.

Therefore, the Demon Race was very restrained now. If they did not start killing, the humans would definitely not dare to break the rules either.

He went straight to Ling Han’s current residence. He had been to the academy many times, so he was familiar with it.

A large number of disciples followed behind Young Master Cat.

Some of them were purely here to watch the show, while others were hoping that Ling Han could display his might and give this envoy from the Demon Race a taste of his own medicine, teaching him a good lesson.

Young Master Cat strode forward, and very quickly arrived at the entrance of Ling Han’s courtyard.

He was very polite and walked over to knock on the door.

However, no one answered.

Young Master Cat looked displeased. You still want to pretend that you’re not around?

Coward. How cowardly. How could such a person defeat the elites of the Demon Race?

Young Master Cat knocked on the door again. Just as he was about to lose his patience and wanted to blast open the door, the door opened with a creak..
