Chapter 3528: Fog

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han was like a tiger that had entered a flock of sheep. In just a few moves, he had defeated those four Enlightenment Tier elites as if they were mere vegetables that he was slicing through.

What!

The two elders who were Mystery Realm Tiers were finally moved. Ling Han’s battle prowess clearly hadn’t reached the level of Mystery Realm Tier, yet his battle prowess far surpassed ordinary Enlightenment Tier. This was practically unimaginable.

This was definitely a prodigy of martial arts, and that was why he could crush his peers as easily as drinking water.

—As they saw it, Ling Han should also be an Enlightenment Tier elite. Otherwise, they really could not imagine that someone could surpass a major tier and still sweep aside all opposition and be invincible.

“Young man, who is your master?” A white-haired old man asked Ling Han.

He was wary about Ling Han’s origins. To be able to nurture such a prodigy, it had to be some old Spiritual Infant monster, or Spirit Transformation True Lord, right?

Thus, he had no choice but to be cautious.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “My Master is the Great Freedom Heavenly Master, and is located above the Nine Heavens, in charge of the universe.”

So awesome.

The two elders exchanged looks. Naturally, it was impossible that they had heard of this name.

“Brat, are you messing with us?” another old man shouted. He had a head of black hair, but he had too many wrinkles.

Ling Han clapped his hands, “Clever.”

“Humph, playing tricks in front of us, you are seeking your own death!” The white-haired old man was furious, and charged towards Ling Han. He stretched out a hand, and grabbed out.

In the end, he had his reservations. Thus, this attack was meant to capture Ling Han, and not kill him.

Ling Han immediately activated Absolute Fairness, and the white-haired old man’s aura instantly plummeted.

—He was not a Celestial Path elite, nor had he fused with the eye of any Primordial Vicious Beast, nor was he the descendant of a Spirit Transformation True Lord, so what kind of treasures could he be bestowed with, to resist Absolute Fairness.

Ling Han charged over, and with a single punch, peng, the white-haired old man was knocked unconscious.

“Impossible!” The other old man exclaimed in shock. Ling Han obviously only displayed battle prowess on the level of Enlightenment Tier, but why did his companion appear even weaker than those people from before? He couldn’t even block a single blow?

Ling Han once again charged towards the black-haired elder, and shot out another punch.

The black-haired old man was already on guard, but Absolute Fairness had directly pulled down his cultivation level by two major levels. How could he possibly be a match for Ling Han?

Peng, he was also knocked unconscious with a single punch.

Ling Han clapped his hands, and looked towards the young man, “How is it now?”

A hint of fear appeared on the young man’s face. The basis of his confidence were his followers, but now that his followers had been defeated, he instantly felt panic in his heart.

“You, you, what do you want to do?” he stuttered, “My father is Zhang Ziyun, a Spiritual Infant Tier great elite!”

Ling Han chuckled, “Nothing much. I just want to give you a beating, so that you can remember clearly. This is not the prison, where you can do as you like.”

The young man took a few steps back, and said, “How dare you, you actually dare—”

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and had already grabbed the young man, giving him a series of punches and kicks.

“What do you mean dare? I’m Hong Tianbu. Don’t you know that I’m the number one prodigy of the Imperial Capital?” Ling Han tried to attract animosity for Hong Tianbu.

What Hong Tianbu? Was he very powerful?

The young man was at a loss, but a punch landed on his nose, causing a nosebleed. Instantly, he screamed in pain.

However, the other seven people had heard of Hong Tianbu’s name, and all of them felt apprehensive. No wonder this person was so powerful. As it turned out, he was Hong Tianbu, one of the twin prodigies of the Imperial City!

After Ling Han gave the young man a good thrashing, he steered this group of people off the ship.

The ship captain and the others were all shocked by Ling Han’s battle prowess, and all of them were trembling in fear.

Ling Han’s expression was cold, and he asked, “There should be no problem if we set out according to the original plan, right?”

“No! Definitely not!” These people hurriedly shook their heads.

Some people had arrived long ago, yet were chased off. It was naturally impossible to find these people. Those who had come later did not know that such an incident had happened, and were completely unaware of it. After they boarded the ship, they entered into their own rooms.

At eleven o’clock, the large ship set off, setting out to sea.

As he watched the large ship leave, the young man who had been thrashed previously appeared again. He said hatefully, “Hurry up and contact Third Senior Brother. Tell him that when he encounters Hong Tianbu on Ethereal Peak, he must kill him!”

“No!” He hurriedly shook his head, “Don’t kill him, leave him alive for me to kill personally!”

“Yes, Young Master.” the attendants hurriedly replied.

Now that there was the Wide Star Vine, communication was too convenient, and distance was completely no problem.

“Achoo.” On a large ship, Hong Tianbu suddenly sneezed. He rubbed his nose. Recently, he had been plagued by bad luck. Otherwise, with his cultivation level of Mystery Realm Tier, how could he possibly sneeze?

Obviously, his bad luck was not as simple as just a sneeze.

After the large ship left the harbor, it raised its sails, and instantly, rode the winds and waves, its speed beginning to spike madly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Recently, everyone had gone to Ethereal Peak. This ship had already made three trips back and forth, so it could be said that it was a walk in the park. Thus, the ship’s boss patted his chest and guaranteed that this trip would only take less than a day, and would definitely be safe.

After entering into the deep sea, though there were winds and waves, the winds were not too fast, and the waves were not too strong either. The ship was slightly shaken, but it would never stop. This caused some people to experience seasickness, and vomit endlessly.

This had nothing to do with abilities. Some people just got seasick.

Ling Han did not have any reaction to this. Furthermore, even if he would get seasick, he only had to enter into the Essence Nurturing Gourd, and he would be able to avoid this kind of feeling.

However, a few hours later, a dark cloud approached, blocking the sun. Suddenly, the surroundings became dusky.

“What is it?” Everyone ran out of their cabins one after another, and came onto the deck. It was clear that there was still a very long time until dark, yet it had suddenly become so dim, which was unacceptable to them.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry,” one of the sailors comforted. “Clouds in the sky, wind on the sea, and the heart of a young girl are always unpredictable. It’s very normal.”

This guy actually was a bit of a poet.

Everyone laughed out loud. Since he said it was normal, there was no need to be nervous.

Ling Han activated his ocular technique, yet he frowned and said, “Is it normal for a fog to appear on the sea?”

“What fog?” Everyone followed his gaze, yet did not see anything. The light was too dim.

“Brat, what nonsense are you spouting?”

“I’m warning you, don’t scare us with such dangerous words!”

“Be careful or I’ll beat you up!”

Everyone chided him, thinking that Ling Han was deliberately saying some false words to attract attention.

However, the sailor had witnessed Ling Han’s might before, so he couldn’t help but feel astonished. He hurriedly shouted, “Boss, a fog has appeared ahead!”

Instantly, the captain of the ship steered the ship and turned around in a hurry.

This was too rushed, and everyone felt as if the ship was about to capsize. They hurriedly grabbed onto the things around them, to prevent themselves from being sent flying.

Ling Han weighed down his body, and his body was firmly locked onto the deck. He looked ahead, and saw that fog was presently rapidly surging towards them.

He shook his head. To say nothing of the fact that the large ship was still turning, even if it had already adjusted its course, and was sailing at full speed, it could not possibly be faster than this fog.

In the blink of an eye, an endless fog wrapped around them..
