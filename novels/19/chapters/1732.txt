Chapter 1733: Severing mortal bonds in the lake’s center

“Yi, why aren’t you guys continuing on with us?” Mao Shuyu asked curiously.

They should climb ashore once they had reached this place, and head to the Cave of Death.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You guys go on ahead. We still have to head somewhere else.”

Somewhere else?

Hadn’t they come to the Severing Mundane Pool to sever their mortal bonds? Then there was only one place they had to go—the final destination, the Cave of Death. Why did they have to go somewhere else?

But since Ling Han was not saying, Mao Shuyu could not find out anything even though she was incredibly curious. She could only continue onwards with Zhang Chong in tow and her heart filled with confusion. Ling Han and his group, meanwhile, continued on the wooden raft, and traveled upriver.

Ling Han thought he had not disappointed the request that Mao Dai had made of him by sending Zhang Chong and Mao Shuyu here. No matter what, it was impossible that he could watch over the two of them for the whole way and be their babysitter.

The three of them boarded the wooden raft, but saw Fu Xiaoyun and Bei Xuanming had just caught up with them, but what was surprising was they, too, did not climb ashore, but rather continued traveling against the river’s flow, as if they were also heading towards the Source Water.

The two sides made eye contact. Fu Xiaoyun was expressionless, while Bei Xuanming showed a taunting expression as he asked, “Mere ants, what right do you have to travel alongside this Holy Son?”

“Oh, do you know what is at the source of this river?” Ling Han asked deliberately.

Bei Xuanming humphed, and retorted, “What need is there for me to tell you?”

“It can’t be that you’re pretending to know when you don’t?” Ling Han laughed loudly.

Instantly, Bei Xuanming showed killing intent. This little ant actually dared to mock him? He immediately wanted to make a move, but Fu Xiaoyun stopped him, so he could only give up in displeasure.

Fu Xiaoyun looked at Ling Han, and said, “A senior of my clan advised me that if I wish to sever my mortal bonds in a different manner, I can only head to the source of this river. Only the mystical power of heaven and earth there would be enough to support this method.”

She paused, and seemed to be watching for any change in Ling Han’s expression, but how could Ling Han possibly reveal anything. Thus, she continued, “Why do you want to go to the source of the river as well?”

Severing Mundane in a different manner would mean striking the heaven and earth.

The other was an heiress of a three-star force, so it was not strange that she knew that she could deliver a strike onto heaven and earth, but what made Ling Han secretly pleased with his luck was the fact that one could only deliver a strike onto heaven and earth at the great river’s source, and it could not be done in the Cave of Death.

After all, Mao Dai had only guessed that the Severing Mundane Pool could allow him to strike the heaven and earth, but limited by his cultivation level and experience, how could he compare to a noble clan of Immortal Palace Tier?

He really had to thank Small Tower. If not for its warning, Ling Han would not be able to strike the heaven and earth. He would either be severely injured or even killed by the backlash, or could only deliver that strike onto himself.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How coincidental. I, too, wish to sever my mortal bonds in a different manner.”

“Hahaha, you think you can!” Bei Xuanming laughed loudly.

Among the veteran three-star forces, it was no secret that one could advance into the Severing Mundane Tier by delivering a strike on the heaven and earth. But being aware was one thing, and being able to do it was another. Bei Xuanming had also once thought of striking the heaven and earth, but in the end, he did not manage to. This strike was still delivered onto his own mortal bonds.

And now a brat that had popped out from who knew where actually said he wanted to sever his mortal bonds in a different manner. That was a real joke.

“Whether I can or otherwise will only be known after I try,” Ling Han said, being neither too humble nor proud.

Bei Xuanming wanted to fly into a rage again. A mere Genesis Tier actually dared to speak to him in this manner?

Yet Fu Xiaoyun smiled, and said, “Then let’s travel together.”

She was very curious about Ling Han because she could not see through him at all. it should be known that she had cultivated a celestial technique. It was not very destructive, but she could see through the real condition of others, but she could not see through Ling Han. There was only one reason for this, and that was that his strength was far superior to hers.

Was this even possible?

She did not believe it. She herself was already a king tier of Genesis Tier, so how could there possibly be anyone that was far stronger than her? It had to be that Ling Han had cultivated a secret technique that could block her probe.

This made her very curious, and she wanted to know exactly what secret technique that was.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Forget it, I don’t like this guy, and this guy doesn’t like me, either, so we had best travel separately.” He pointed at Bei Xuanming.

Bei Xuanming almost exploded in fury. He was a first severance grand elder, and only he had the right to dislike Ling Han. Was this brat treating him like they were equals?

Fu Xiaoyun smiled daintily, however, and only felt that Ling Han was very interesting. She nodded, and said, “All right, I hope you will be able to successfully sever your mortal bonds in a different manner.”

“Same to you.” Ling Han clasped his hands in response. By now, he also felt that it was a slight pity for Fu Xiaoyun to be matched with Bei Xuanming. She was clearly too good for him.

Bei Xuanming looked coldly at Ling Han, his killing intent surging. He definitely had to find some chance to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han could see this, and merely smiled faintly. He only had to successfully advance into the Severing Mundane Tier, and even if Bei Xuanming advanced into the second severance, so what? He could still crush him!

The two wooden rafts advanced continuously, going against the flow of the river. After traveling for a whole three days, the source of the river finally appeared ahead of them. The endless river water was surging out of a giant lake, and there was a massive rock in the water, forming an island at the center of the lake.

It was really tough for them to reach this point. There were many whirlpools on their way there, and the slightest carelessness could destroy their rafts and kill them. Thankfully, their reaction speed was incredibly fast, or even if it was a first severance grand elder, he could still be finished on the way here.

In this place, that mysterious mystical power of heaven and earth was rolling out, and was incredibly abundant.

After Fu Xiaoyun and Bei Xuanming rowed their raft to stop at the side of the rock, the two of them first climbed ashore, and then stored the wooden raft into a Spatial Spirit Tool. They planned to sever their mortal bonds here. One was aiming for Celestial level, while the other was planning to attain the second severance.

Ling Han and his group also climbed ashore the island at the lake’s center, and similarly put the wooden raft away. Meanwhile, Small Tower was mentally speaking to Ling Han, telling him that the Source Water of heaven and earth should be at the bottom of this lake.

To go underwater now?

Ling Han shook his head. If he was to dive alone, he would be worried about the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. If he took them into the Black Tower, the Empress would not be able to advance to Severing Mundane Tier. Who knew how long it would take to sever one’s mortal bonds, so how could he waste time?

Moreover, he, too, had to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier.

He thought for a moment, and decided to first sever his mortal bonds with the empress. After they advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, he would then set out in search of the Source Water of heaven and earth—if he could obtain it, he would be lucky, but if he did not manage to, then he would just forget about it. He could always come back after he had become a Celestial King.

But if he missed this opportunity to sever his mortal bonds, he would have to wait another 10,000,000 years. This was too long a time.

He told the Empress this, and the two of them sat down on the island in the lake’s center, and began their breakthrough to the Severing Mundane Tier.

Though the two of them had already reached the peak stage of Genesis Tier, Severing Mundane Tier was a completely different beginning. All their previous experience would be of no help. They could only comprehend the unique mystical power of the heaven and earth here, and then attempt to control this power to deliver a strike onto themselves.

Because they were inexperienced, this was especially dangerous. In the slightest moment of carelessness, they could kill themselves. And the Severing Mundane Pool was one of the best locations for severing mortal bonds. This mystical power of heaven and earth was also especially strong, so the strength of the strike was naturally astonishing.

Ling Han and the others all tried hard to get used to this kind of mystical power. Because Bei Xuanming had already struck himself once, he appeared to be very much at ease. Additionally, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was also getting used to this kind of mystical power; there would come the day that she would have to strike herself eventually.

This mystical power was heartless and cold, and represented the fact that the heavens were completely impartial, and would not take into account wealth, strength, or nobility. In the eyes of the heavens, every existence was equal. And this heartlessness would become a blade to sever the mortal bond that one valued the most, and then one would be able to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier.

It was easier said than done. This kind of mortal bond, kinship bond, was also called karmic hindrance and obsession. How could it be severed so easily?
