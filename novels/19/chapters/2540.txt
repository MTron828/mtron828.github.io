Chapter 2541: Wally’s counter

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han did not manage to stop him in time. Wally nodded, and replied, “Yes!”

This guy did not know how to lie at all.

Everyone cried out in surprise. Though they knew that there were some dimensions that were proficient in technology, and had indeed seen War Soldiers before, this was truly the first time they had seen one as “human” as Wally.

Liu Yufei’s eyes shone strangely, and she stared at Wally for a while before finally withdrawing her gaze.

“This little chit is no simple character, and definitely has ulterior motives,” the large black dog whispered next to Ling Han’s ear.

Ling Han nodded. The timing of Liu Yufei’s appearance was too coincidental. She had come earlier, but this should also have been her first time here. Furthermore, the information she had grasped was inaccurate as she did not know that the great doors could only be opened with the use of lifeblood from a great many supreme monarch stars.

Perhaps she had been just about to leave when she discovered Ling Han and the others. Otherwise, with how dense the poisonous fog was outside, how could she have so many antidote pills?

At least, Ling Han previously had not known that this historical site had belonged to Celestial King He Feng, yet Liu Yufei had revealed this quickly. The information she had gained definitely was superior to what Ling Han knew. In fact, it might be that she had even more information than Xiao Yingxiong and the others.

Weng, Wally continuously released waves of green. They were extremely rhythmical as they reverberated into the distance. A great beast appeared, but when the wave swept over it, a clear disruption appeared.

“This is real,” Wally said.

He was always serious in his actions. Since he said that he would determine the authenticity of these great beasts, he would definitely execute this action with 100% effort. He would not bother about what others thought at all.

When the great beast approached, everyone made their move.?Boom, this great beast was instantly blasted into bits. It was indeed real.

At this, everyone no longer had any more doubts about Wally’s ability.

“Aren’t War Soldiers machines made for war?” Xu Huan asked. This was also a supreme monarch star, whose cultivation level had even reached Sixth Heaven.

Wally explained, “I am not made for battle, but rather for analysis.”

Ling Han quickly changed the topic. Wally could not hide any secrets at all. He would answer anything he was asked. If they found out more about Wally’s abilities, they would probably bear malicious intentions towards him. In fact, they might even find out that the robbery of Heavenborn’s abode was their doing.

The large black dog also had the same thought. He directly used a paw to cover Wally’s mouth.

“Hehe, is there something that cannot be known to others?” the Imperial Void Celestial King asked calmly. He reached out a hand to grab the large black dog.

How could the move of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King be anything ordinary?

The large black dog roared in fury, “Imperial Void boy, do you think that Grandpa Dog is afraid of you?”

He opened his mouth, and spat out a shadowy light. There were boundless seals flickering in this light, causing a cold chill to grip at everyone’s heart.

This light… was too terrifying.

Yet the Imperial Void Celestial King was unafraid. They had both originated from the Celestial Realm, and he was already one of the strongest existences within the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier in the Celestial Realm. Boundless starlight flickered in his giant hand, as if it, too, had become a great beast.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

After a few exchanges, the large black dog was forced to retreat. There was still a slight gap in strength between him and the Imperial Void Celestial King.

“Since you are an analysis-type War Soldier, then help me take a look. What am I lacking that is causing my inability to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier?” the Imperial Void Celestial King asked Wally.

Actually, he did not have much high expectations. The other was not a Heavenly Venerate, so how could he possibly give him any guidance? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yet Wally surveyed him, and answered, “Payment is required.”

The Imperial Void Celestial King laughed in spite of himself. “You really think that you can help me?”

Wally nodded. “At least, I can point out your shortcomings.”

The Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t help but be tempted. He did not fear that Wally would deceive him, as he would be able to easily suppress the latter. He nodded slowly. “What do you want?”

“Divine Metal, Dimension Scrolls, or the like,” Wally answered casually.

The Imperial Void Celestial King couldn’t help a twitch of his lips. And he said “or the like”? This was Divine Metal. There was not much even in an entire dimension, especially after Heavenly Venerates had appeared. It would all be taken to improve their Devouring Metal, so just how much Divine Metal would there be left after everything?

Even if he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he had just obtained 17 pieces of Divine Metal himself. As for Dimension Scroll, even he did not know what that was.

“A piece of Divine Metal in exchange for a single question,” Wally continued. Since this involved Heavenly Venerable Tier, the value was too high. He naturally had to hike up his price.

Though the Imperial Void Celestial King was tempted, he did not have any Divine Metal on him. Could it be that he would have to shatter the Ancient Bell of Qian and give a piece to Wally?

Still, if the method to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier could be obtained from Wally, then the Ancient Bell of Qian would no longer be important to him, so what did it matter if he had to surrender it?

“All right!” He took out the Ancient Bell of Qian, and threw it over to Wally. “This is my precious tool, and is forged from a total of 17 Divine Metal pieces fused together. As long as your answer can satisfy me, I can give it to you! However, if you dare to deceive me, then do not blame me for being violent.”

Wally was completely unconcerned. His eyes only glowed green, and scanned over the Ancient Bell of Qian. Immediately, he shook his head. “This Divine Metal is not pure enough, and has pitifully little essence. At most, it can only be considered the equivalent of five pieces of Divine Metal.”

The Imperial Void Celestial King was stunned. Not pure enough? How was that possible!

It was he himself that had melted these 17 pieces of Divine Metal, so how could he not know if they were pure or impure? Furthermore, how could impure Divine Metal possibly possess such great might? Wasn’t that just a joke?

“As expected, you are lying to me!” he declared menacingly.

He knew it; how could a mere War Soldier possibly know how to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier? He was just trying to scam him.

Ling Han was secretly guilty. He naturally knew what was going on here. It was because he had previously used the Divine Demon Sword to extract the essence of Divine Metal inside the Ancient Bell of Qian, and that was why the Ancient Bell of Qian had now become impure.

If the Imperial Void Celestial King knew this, he would probably go all out and fight him.

The Imperial Void Celestial King lashed out, and delivered a palm strike at Wally.

This was only a War Soldier; so what if he killed him? Even if this was known to the martial academy, there was nothing he had to fear. It was different if he wanted to kill Ling Han or any other person as he would have to kill the others to prevent them from leaking the secret. Otherwise, as long as even one of them returned, and reported this to the martial academy, then even if the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable spoke up on his behalf, it would be useless. He would definitely have to pay the price with his life.

Nothing would be accomplished without rules, and no one was an exception to this.

…He naturally did not know that Wally was actually also a disciple of the martial academy. This was arranged by Heavenly Venerate Zhou Heng. Otherwise, he would have done some serious thinking before he made a move.

With how terrifying a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was, when the blow landed, Wally was instantly crushed into bits.

Ling Han, the large black dog, and the Empress made no move to interfere. They knew that Wally’s “vitality” was incredibly strong. Previously, he had already been destroyed by the large black dog once before, and hadn’t he still recovered from that in the end?

As the product of several hundred epochs of hard work of a whole dimension, how could he be so easily destroyed?

“Humph!” The Imperial Void Celestial King sneered coldly, and swept aside his sleeves. He even swept a menacing look over Ling Han and the large black dog, his warning obvious. This was the consequence of having caused him displeasure.

“Huh?!”

“Ah!”

“Aaah!”

But Xiao Yingxiong and the others immediately exclaimed in shock, and saw that those bits of Wally seemed to have gained a life of their own, and were gathering in the same direction. Then, they fused together, turning into a massive sphere, which then grew arms, legs, and a head.

In just the blink of the eye, Wally reappeared again.

Seeing this scene, even the Imperial Void Celestial King was stunned. He definitely had not expected that a “person” that he had personally killed could actually still come back to life.

Wally stared at the Imperial Void Celestial King.?Zi, red light burst from his eyes. This power that was filled with destruction and had incredible, extraordinary speed instantly swept onto the Imperial Void Celestial King.

“Urgh!” The Imperial Void Celestial King released a muffled groan.
