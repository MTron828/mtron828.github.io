3036 Heading to Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains watched as Ling Han’s figure gradually disappeared into the distance, his heart filled with mixed feelings.

A mere Fifth Tier could actually make him lose his temper. Then, what would happen when Ling Han reached the Sixth Tier?

In fact… Seventh Tier?

He shook his head, allowing himself to recover from dejection. He was in the Seventh Tier, an existence that couldn’t be killed even if the Genesis World collapsed. How could he be so passive?

As long as he evolved the dimensions to the extreme, he would definitely be able to possess even greater strength. At that time, he would definitely be able to kill Ling Han.

Definitely!

Ling Han returned to meet the Empress and the others, and then decided to leave.

He couldn’t keep fixating on Shatter Mountains. It was not fair.

Rain had to be split evenly, right?

The group set off for Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment.

This distance was very long, but Ling Han traveled at full speed. In just over 10 days, they arrived near Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment.

Their current location was a large city, and Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment was tens of thousands of kilometers outside the city. For Celestial Kings, they didn’t need to walk for long, so it was naturally very close.

They rested for a while, and then Ling Han put all of them into the Celestial Guest Residence, and then moved out.

This time, he couldn’t be bothered to play slowly.

In just a few steps, he appeared at the foot of the Chong Yan place of enlightenment.

He walked up the mountain calmly.

Chong Yan’s place of enlightenment didn’t have any restricted areas. Anyone could come here, but not many people could reach the top of the mountain.

This was because Chong Yan had set up a restriction here. It was impossible to reach the end point without a powerful ability to challenge those above one’s level.

Ling Han intentionally suppressed his cultivation level to experience this suppressive power.

However, Chong Yan had set up such a restriction mainly to test Celestial Kings, so it couldn’t possibly be too powerful. Thus, even if Ling Han suppressed his cultivation level, his physique had been tempered by four types of fundamental power, and he also had boundless Powers of Dimension. This was too powerful.

He placed his hands behind his back, and walked towards the top of the mountain. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Eh, this person is so showy. He even has his arms crossed behind his back.”

“Hehe, if you posture, you’ll be struck by lightning. It won’t be long before this guy crawls like a dog.”

“I’ll bet with you. This guy can’t even crawl. He’ll probably just lie on the ground.”

There were people on the road, and they all spoke up.

As long as one could successfully reach the top of the mountain, they would be able to obtain a token. This would free them from the suppression, and they would be able to come and go as they pleased.

Therefore, apart from those who wanted to enter the place of enlightenment, the others were all calm and collected.

“Look, look, who’s here?”

“What an extravagance!”

On the mountain road, many people looked toward the foot of the mountain, and saw a super luxurious carriage speeding toward them.

‘How luxurious?’

This carriage was actually being pulled by nine True Dragons, which were all Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings!

Hiss, could it be that the person who came was a Heavenly Venerate? Otherwise, how could he be qualified to be pulled by nineTrue Dragons that were in Ninth Heaven?

It wasn’t just the steeds. The carriage itself was also incomparably luxurious. Its entire body was made of Divine Metal, and it naturally had veined patterns that extracted the yin and yang energy and gathered the essence of the Five Elements. It was practically a holy land for cultivation.

Regulations manifested, and it was incomparably magnificent.

The carriage quickly arrived at the foot of the mountain before coming to a stop. A woman as beautiful as a fairy stepped out of the carriage.

There were nine ribbons of iridescent light surrounding her body, and she was clearly a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Was this the owner of the carriage?

But jaw-droppingly, she walked to the other side of the carriage, and respectfully opened the door. “Young Master, we’re here.”

Young Master?

Hiss, this woman was actually just a maid.

Everyone was shocked. Nine Ninth Heaven True Dragons pulling the carriage and a Ninth Heaven beauty as a maid. What kind of background did this young master have?

Under everyone’s gazes, a man in white alighted from the carriage. His hair was black and thick, and it was tied up with a jade crown. His face was as beautiful and translucent as jade.

“Yi!”

Everyone was surprised because this young man only had seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around his body.

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King?

This wasn’t right. No matter how strong a Seventh Heaven was, he shouldn’t be able to make 10 Ninth Heaven elites willingly become his servants, right?

“Hehe, he’s Yan Wuyue!”

“Yan Wuyue? Who is Yan Wuyue?”

“Eh, could it be that supreme prodigy from the Yan Clan?”

“Exactly.”

“Hey, whom are you guys talking about?”

“You’re really ignorant. You don’t even know about Yan Wuyue?”

“Don’t you know about the three Heavenly Venerates in the Yan Clan?”

“Hiss, it’s actually that Yan Clan?”

“That’s right. This Yan Wuyue is the most outstanding descendant of the Yan Clan. It’s said that he has the potential to surpass his master. In the future, he might reach the Third Tier or even the Fourth Tier, surpassing his father, uncle, and grandfather.”

“No wonder. Such a person naturally has Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings willing to follow him. If he’s lucky, he might be able to leap through the dragon gate and advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

On the mountain path, many Celestial Kings were filled with emotion. Although they had also passed the test and entered the place of enlightenment of Chong Yan, what about becoming a Heavenly Venerate?

Perhaps one or two of them could succeed, but people like Yan Wuyue were destined to become mighty figures in the future. Their lives were so good that it made people jealous.

Yan Wuyue had a faint smile on his face. He looked very approachable, but his eyes were filled with incomparable pride, as if he was looking down from above.

As far as he was concerned, the people here were all trash. They didn’t even have the qualifications to make him take a second look.

“Yan Wuyue wants to worship the Chong Yan place of enlightenment too?”

“Didn’t they say that he would definitely become a Heavenly Venerate?”

“Fool, even if you’re bound to become a Heavenly Venerate, there’s still a difference in the amount of time you would take. Besides, what kind of existence is a Heavenly Venerate? How can you be bound to become one?”

“If I were to become Lord Chong Yan’s disciple, that would truly be certain. Furthermore, I would be able to reach an even higher limit.”

Amidst everyone’s discussions, Yan Wuyue went up the mountain.

He didn’t let his maidservant follow him, and the nine dragons had already pulled the carriage away. He climbed the mountain step by step as if they were taking a leisurely stroll.

“He’s really strong. He doesn’t show any signs of strain under such pressure.”

“He’s a prodigy!”

“I have to admit that.”

“Hehe, there’s another person up there. He’s clearly showing off. Compared to Yan Wuyue, the difference is obvious.”

Everyone sighed with emotion, and naturally thought that Ling Han’s relaxed attitude was completely fake.

However, Yan Wuyue knew very well how much pressure he himself was under.

However, he cared too much about his reputation. He purposely didn’t channel his full power to show that he was at ease. Naturally, he could only suffer in silence.

He sped up. He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to reach the top of the mountain if he continued to idle around like this. That would really be a huge joke.

Yan Wuyue walked faster and faster, and soon caught up with Ling Han.

His gaze turned cold. He had come to become a disciple, but someone actually dared to block his path?

‘Get lost!’

He brazenly attacked, sweeping towards Ling Han. He intended to smack Ling Han down the mountain.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and also returned a palm strike.

Peng, Yan Wuyue immediately turned into a rolling gourd and rolled all the way down the mountainside. After rolling for an unknown number of times, he finally stopped at the foot of the mountain. His four limbs were spread out as if he spread-eagled.

“…” Everyone else.
