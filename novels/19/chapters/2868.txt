2869 Empty Fort Strategy

“Why?” Yue Chengwang’s remnant soul, which hadn’t yet dissipated completely, let out an unwilling voice.

Didn’t Ling Han promise not to kill him?

“Just kidding, don’t take it seriously!” Ling Han said lightly.

Yue Chengwang’s remnant soul let out a shrill cry. Despite being reluctant, it could only return to heaven and earth.

!!

If he wasn’t dead already, he would still be infuriated to death by Ling Han.

Ling Han stood upright in mid-air and glanced around. Here, the sky was filled with yellow sand, and the heaven and earth were so unique that even the eyesight of the Heavenly Venerate couldn’t reach very far.

After scanning around, he said, “Listen, demons and monsters, I will stay here for 10 days. If anyone wants to make a move, I will definitely oblige you for a battle.”

After speaking, he just sat down cross-legged.

This… was so domineering!

In the distance, the figures of Heavenly Venerates loomed.

Yue Chengwang and the others were interested in the treasures belonging to Ling Han, so how could other people’s hearts actually be at peace?

Naturally that was impossible.

Yue Chengwang and the others had merely moved first, while the others were simply waiting and observing. It was inevitable that a huge battle would be set off.

However, no one thought that the battle between Ling Han and Yue Chengwang would end so quickly; moreover it was a complete victory for Ling Han, with him absolutely crushing the other party without sustaining any injury at all.

Facing such a terrifying opponent, who would dare to step out and be targeted?

However, only Ling Han knew that he had had no other option.

It was due to the fact that he possessed a special ability—after killing a Heavenly Venerate, he would absorb the life essence of the other party. Remember, he had killed six Heavenly Venerates in one go just now, with five of them having already advanced to the Fourth Tier.

Thus, their life essences gushed into his body all at once, making him feel like he was about to explode!

The infinite Powers of Dimension were like a millstone, crushing these life essences and turning them into energy that Ling Han could absorb, improving his cultivation level at a terrifying speed. Yet on the other hand, this power was too terrifying, and the rush of power caused him indescribable pain.

One had to know that despite him having insta-killed these opponents, there was actually a trick to it. In terms of real battle prowess, the Highest North Heavenly Venerate and Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate were not much inferior to Ling Han, and it was merely that the Heavenly Venerable Seals that Ling Han had mastered were much more impressive. Additionally, with the assistance of the broken saber, all that allowed him to create a miracle.

However, these Heavenly Venerates exploded, and the life essences gushed into his body. He was actually being filled to the brim, to the point of nearly exploding. The pain was so difficult to bear that he had to use all his power to suppress it.

Ling Han forcibly suppressed that feeling of pain. Should he show even the slightest hint of being in pain, perhaps some daring person would make a move against him, and then would immediately be able to confirm his real condition.

Although Ling Han would still have the help of the Empress and Hu Niu, the strength of the two women was only at the Third Tier, and fighting against a Fourth Tier would surely be a disastrous situation for them.

Therefore, Ling Han had no choice but to take a risk, and sat down domineeringly just like that. On the contrary, it made people unable to ascertain his depth and real condition.

Inside his body, his cultivation level was skyrocketing.

As expected of a Fourth Tier, the power was extremely powerful indeed, so much that the energy being transformed was overwhelmingly abundant.

One day, two days, three days… Time passed continuously, and soon the 10 days’ time was up.

Ling Han didn’t stand up. He realized that he had still underestimated the energy of the six Heavenly Venerates, especially the five Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates. He wasn’t able to fully absorb the energy in 10 days, so he still couldn’t stand up.

He continued to sit and refine the energy, but this made other Heavenly Venerates develop other ideas.

“The 10-day period is up, why hasn’t he left yet?”

“Did he think that wasn’t enough display of his might, and still intend to continue intimidating us?”

“What an arrogant guy.”

“But is there a possibility that something is wrong with him?”

“It isn’t an impossibility. It would be absolutely impossible to kill five elites of comparable strength in one go without paying a little price.”

“Hiss, then this guy was deliberately being intimidating before, but he was actually in the process of healing?”

Everyone looked at each other in dismay. If this had been true, then they might have missed a great opportunity.

“Perhaps, right now he still hasn’t recovered yet?”

“Hehe, why don’t you go up and test it out?”

Many people were speculating that Ling Han still might not have recovered his battle prowess, but who would dare to give it a try?

Hadn’t they seen the fate of the Purple Flames Heavenly Venerate and the others?

If, by any chance, Ling Han was deliberately setting a trap, and trying to lure out those who wanted to kill him, then wouldn’t that be walking right into his trap?

Thus, many people were getting restless, but stayed still.

The more people there were, the more their hearts wouldn’t be united. Perhaps if there was only one person, he would grit his teeth and get on with it.

Yet right now, you were looking at me, and I was looking at you. No one wanted to pave the way for others, so the opportunity was wasted just like that.

Just like this, another seven days passed by in a flash.

Ling Han’s body moved, and he stood up.

He had finally refined all the life essences of the Heavenly Venerates. Not only had he regained his battle prowess, but his battle prowess had also further increased by another notch due to the fact that his cultivation level had advanced to the late stage of the Second Tier.

“All of you…” Ling Han swept a gaze around and shook his head. “…have missed a great opportunity. I did lose my battle prowess previously, and should anyone have made a move, I’d have been unable to stop it. Well, for the sake of you being so obedient, I will spare you this once.”

He laughed and walked away.

This… was too arrogant!

Everyone was furious. It turned out that they had really fallen into Ling Han’s empty fort strategy.

But since he had succeeded, then fine. Why did he still need to say it out loud and mock others?

Damn, it was too detestable of him.

Yet they hadn’t dared to make a move before, let alone now.

...

Who else with cultivation level below Fifth Tier could take down Ling Han?

Unless it was the strongest prodigies such as Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu.

“That’s right. He killed Xin Qihu’s servant. Although he was merely a Celestial King, who is Xin Qihu? He’s someone who would never accept such humiliation.”

“We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.”

Everyone comforted themselves in this way. Ling Han was doomed to die anyway, so why should they take action?

***

Ling Han returned to the base. Upon returning, he handed the broken saber to Zhou Heng, while Lin Xiaoyang and Chu Hao both went to find new veins of ore.

Zhou Heng immediately said that this was definitely not the precious tool of a Sixth Tier, but rather belonged to a Seventh Tier as he himself couldn’t forge this kind of precious tool.

Astonishingly, two Seventh-Tier items had appeared here.

However, the Seventh Tier was immortal, and now the corpse of a Seventh Tier and a broken weapon of a Seventh Tier were found. Ultimately, whose hands had caused this?

...

Zhou Heng thought for a while before saying, “Theoretically speaking, a Seventh Tier can die. However, it’s not like being killed by someone, but rather that he can collapse his mind himself. Even if the physical body is immortal, what remains will just be a dead soul.”

Ling Han nodded. A Seventh Tier couldn’t be killed, because the body was too strong, and there wasn’t any kind of power that could penetrate it, so it was naturally indestructible, but suicide would be an entirely different matter.

“But, does a Seventh Tier have a reason to commit suicide?”

This was the critical point. Which Seventh Tier would commit suicide? Could one have cultivated himself into an idiot?

Ling Han looked at Zhou Heng, while Zhou Heng also looked at him. They couldn’t figure out why a Seventh Tier would commit suicide.

“This dimension is much more complicated than we have imagined, and, quite possibly, hiding some world-shaking secret,” Zhou Heng said.

Indeed, only this dimension had Heavenly Venerable Stone, and could also produce Great Herbs that could be used by even Heavenly Venerates and even Heavenly Venerable Seals!

It should be known that Heavenly Venerates were hated by the heaven and earth, so how could the heaven and earth produce Heavenly Venerable Seals to help the Heavenly Venerates?

Not much consideration had been given to this matter before, because it was a wonderful thing, but when the Seventh Tier corpse was found, everything became weird.
