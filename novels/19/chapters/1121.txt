Chapter 1122: I’ll Hit You

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After arriving at this level, Ling Han finally saw Shao Sisi and the others again. He also saw some people of the older generation, some of them at the Sun Moon Tier, and some of them at the Heavenly Body Tier.

It was clear that after passing the sixth trial, everyone took the seventh trial with extreme seriousness. Everyone was recovering and bringing themselves up to their peak condition. Only then would they challenge the seventh trial.

Perhaps Ling Han didn’t think much of the Purple Pattern Mountain River Pills, but how incredible would the Purple Pattern Sun Moon Pills be? Or the Purple Pattern Heavenly Body Pills?

This was especially so for the Purple Pattern Heavenly Body Pill. After reaching Empress Luan Xing’s level, even an elevation of one star would allow her to become invincible throughout the Joint Peace Planet for two hours, to say nothing of an elevation of four or even five stars.

Thus, these alchemical pills were extremely precious.

If you had them and I also had them, then it would be good for both you and me. Moreover, neither party would dare to use them carelessly. This was a type of strategic weapon. If they weren’t used with care, and if the balance of power was disrupted, chaotic changes could ensue, perhaps resulting in the destruction of an entire Majestic Empire.

In addition, there would be a huge power disparity between someone who had a six-star Purple Pattern Heavenly Body Pill and someone who had a seven-star Purple Pattern Heavenly Body Pill.

Thus, everyone naturally gave it their all when challenging the stone statues.

Ling Han didn’t see Shui Yanyu. This wasn’t surprising, as she had probably been eliminated already. After all, she was only a two-star genius. It was impossible for her to arrive at this level.

He started to adjust his condition. After reaching his peak state, he entered the seventh level of the tower.

There was nothing to hesitate about, and Ling Han directly unleashed his Ultimate Arrow.

Pa!

The stone statue immediately fell down. However, it had only fallen down, and not been sent flying.

Ling Han shook his head in his mind. By the looks of it, his “hit me” path would come to an end here. The stone statue on the eighth level definitely wouldn’t be struck down by his Ultimate Arrow unless he could reach the height of a seven or even eight-star genius.

As for the ninth level?

He would need to reach the height of a nine or perhaps even 10-star genius!

Fortunately, there was an “I’ll hit you” option in addition to the “hit me” option. Although Ling Han didn’t want to be hit, he was even more curious to find out what the reward for passing the ninth level was.

He strode toward the entrance to the eighth level. Unlike the seventh level, this place was empty and deserted.

Even prodigies like Shao Sisi hadn’t made it to this level yet. They had been specially sent to a small world to open the sky and perfect their cultivation foundation, yet they still hadn’t formed a fifth Mountain and River, after all. As they hadn’t reached the pinnacle of the Mountain River Tier yet, their strength could only reach a maximum of six stars.

Combined with some secret techniques, a power of six stars was perhaps enough to help one scrape past the seventh level. However, it would be impossible for them to pass the eighth level.

As before, there were two stone statues standing in the middle of the room. However, there was an extra vial of pills on the ground this time. It was clear that the Invincible Paragon Saint was feeling red-faced after his prediction of Ling Han not being able to pass had turned out to be inaccurate. He didn’t have the face to show himself.

Ling Han chuckled as he grabbed the vial of pills. However, the stopper on the vial couldn’t be opened, and it was evident that these pills couldn’t be used to pass the trials in this tower.

He didn’t diss the Invincible Paragon Saint anymore, instead sitting down to recover to his peak condition. He held a True Origin Stone in his hand, and channeled the Universal Eight Desolation Technique to absorb the power from the stone. The speed of his recovery was incredibly quick.

After around two hours or so, he stood up and climbed the stairs to the eighth level.

He picked the “I’ll hit you” stone statue. In terms of offensive ability, his power hadn’t even reached six stars yet. As such, even the explosive power of his Ultimate Arrow was somewhat limited. In other words, it was impossible for him to raise his power anymore. When it came to defensive ability, however, how many stars could he surpass?

‘Hehe, come at me.’

The “I’ll hit you” stone statue instantly came to life when he walked before it. Then, it struck its fist toward him.

Peng!

Ling Han was instantly sent flying. However, before he had even landed, the stone statue had already caught up again and launched another strike.

‘So fast! So powerful!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

There was no special divine pattern on the stone statue’s body. It was just that its power was extraordinarily great. Ling Han couldn’t block its fists.

However, what did that matter?

His defenses had already reached the toughness of Level Four Godly metal. If one wanted to wound him with raw power, they would need to possess power that was at least at the Sun Moon Tier.

In any case, all Ling Han could do was try his best to ward off the stone statue’s relentless and powerful attacks. There was absolutely no opportunity for him to counterattack. He tried his best to protect his face. Since he couldn’t escape the fate of being beaten, of course it was necessary for him to guard his handsome face.

When choosing the “hit me” statues, one strike was all it took to pass the trial and thus level. However, the “I’ll hit you” statues were completely different.

Peng, peng, peng!

A barrage of relentless attacks continued to rain down on Ling Han, and it appeared as if the stone statue would only stop when it had beaten him to death. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Only when the hourglass stopped flowing did the stone statue retreat to the side. The “I’ll hit you” on its chest changed into “pass.”

Ling Han groaned, and thought to himself, ‘Can’t you beat me a little less?’

He walked out, and the stone tablet reappeared among the changed surroundings. However, another person had also arrived in this place.

It was Empress Luan Xing!

This was astounding. Empress Luan Xing had also managed to make it here! However, had she passed by striking the stone statue, or had she passed by being beaten by the stone statue?

Ling Han felt that the former was more possible. After all, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was far too unique. However, if it were the former, then this empress’ power was unexpectedly strong. If this were the case, shouldn’t she have been powerful enough to defeat the Jade Drop and Eternity Sky Majestic Empires? Why didn’t she unite the Joint Peace Planet?

Of course, it was also possible that those two Majestic Empires had been Imperial Empires before. If that were the case, they would have extremely powerful trump cards—for example, supreme killing formations that couldn’t be moved. As such, they would have tremendously powerful defenses even if their offensive abilities were lacking.

There was definitely a reason behind the three Majestic Empires being able to coexist “peacefully” for millions of years.

Empress Luan Xing also saw Ling Han. A look of astonishment appeared on her face that was hidden by the aura of Primal Chaos that shrouded her. She hadn’t expected anyone else to also make it through the first eight levels of the tower. She even more so didn’t expect that person to be Ling Han.

Killing intent flashed past her beautiful eyes. She, who had never been touched by a man before, had actually sucked this person’s blood! And she had sucked it from his neck, no less. Moreover... her breasts had also been groped by this bastard!

These memories caused her killing intent to seethe and boil. Even that wisp of will in her mind couldn’t prevent her from steeling her resolve to kill this person. She immediately struck a palm toward Ling Han.

This was an attack from a Heavenly Body Tier elite, and even heaven and earth lost their luster.

“Stop, stop, stop!” the stone tablet shouted. The overwhelming attack instantly vanished into thin air. “Although I also detest that brat, anyone who enters this tower is a seed. Before I give up on them, none of them can die!”

Ling Han’s heart thumped against his chest. There was the Invincible Paragon Saint to protect him now, but what would he do after they left this tower?

He cultivated in the Scarlet Heaven Academy, and the Great Ling Empire was also a vassal state of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. He could run, but he couldn’t hide!

‘Sigh, why did you suddenly run over to suck blood? It’s not like you’re a bat or anything!’

Empress Luan Xing didn’t attack anymore, instead simply glaring at Ling Han.

She knew that it would be impossible to kill Ling Han here. Thus, being the decisive person that she was, she naturally wouldn’t waste any more time or strength on him. However, she was infuriated by the fact that she could only glare at the pervert who had molested her, even though he was standing right before her eyes.

She was an empress, a ruler of a Majestic Empire, yet she actually couldn’t deal with a lowly subordinate?

“It’s the last trial already, so hurry up and begin! I can barely wait any longer,” the Invincible Paragon Saint said. “Hurry, hurry, hurry! If you can pass, I’ll give you a massive surprise!”

Empress Luan Xing didn’t hesitate, and immediately climbed the stairs to the ninth level. It was clear that her goal was to leave this tower as soon as possible and then kill Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head. By the looks of it, he would have no choice but to use the Black Tower.
