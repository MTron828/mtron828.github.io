Chapter 1591: Killed

In the darkness, even the Heaven Demons felt that their senses were greatly affected. They could not see, hear, or sense anything that was more than 30 meters away from them.

This was inconceivable. For those that had reached their level, they only needed to release their divine sense, and they would be able to even accommodate a whole planet in the range of their senses. And now, all of a sudden, their senses were restricted to a diameter of around 30 meters, which naturally was something that they had difficulty to adapt to.

There was nothing they could do about it. So what if they were peak stage Heaven Demons? They had only grasped the Regulations of the Netherworld, so how could they possibly be a match for the present Ling Han?

This was being overwhelmed by his superiority in Regulations.

Ling Han brandished the two swords like a thousand-armed guardian deity. Sword Qi danced unhindered, and blood spurted in all directions.

He was too strong. His individual battle prowess was enough to overwhelm even peak stage Heaven Demons, and only the 10 strongest big shots combining forces would be able to stop his progress at the minimum, but now that they were being enshrouded by the darkness, what combining forces? Easier said than done!

This created a massive opening for Ling Han, allowing him to attack freely as he desired.

Pu, pu, pu, pu. One after another, heads flew. They were all the strongest beings of the current era. There were Earth Demons and Black Demons among them. However, Yellow Demons did not even have the right to participate, so they’d managed to avoid this calamity.

And whether it was being beheaded by the Divine Demon Sword or the broken wooden sword, that would be a fatal blow. It was guaranteed that not even their spirits would be able to flee, as they would be destroyed.

“A bunch of liars who uphold a false reputation!” Ling Han uttered coldly, and the Divine Demon Sword in his right hand slashed out. Another Earth Demon was killed, blood spraying out. He did not dodge; bathing in the divine blood made his killing intent blaze even further.

“I kindly agreed to help you all merge the two Realms, and gave you all a chance to become Celestial beings, and this is your repayment to me?

“Could it be that you all think that I am made of clay, and will allow you to knead and shape as you wish?

“This is the choice you have made, so you should now suffer the consequences of your actions!”

Pu, pu, pu

. Another several heads were sent flying.

“Retreat!” a Heaven Demon shouted loudly. “Those below Heaven Demon, all of you retreat, you are merely going to your deaths this way!”

“Run!”

All the Heaven Demons felt heartache. These Earth Demons and Black Demons were all the pillars of strength of their clans, the future grand elders. And if they could open the doors to the Celestial Realm, then these people could possibly have a chance of becoming Severing Mundane Ancestors.

Watching them killed like they were mere vegetables being harvested, they were enraged yet helpless. In this complete darkness, their reaction speed was innumerable times slower than usual. They could only dispel the attacks directed towards themselves; how could they manage to dispel the attacks directed towards the others in the nick of time?

The other Demon Masters hurriedly fled, but just how much weaker were they as compared to the present Ling Han?

They were clearly running in one direction, but no matter how much they ran, they could not run out of this darkness, because their senses had practically lost all significance in this place. They were completely incapable of confirming if they really were running in a straight line.

All the Heaven Demons were also helpless. The present Ling Han’s power was seriously superior to theirs, and they were not able to dispel the darkness in their surroundings at all. They could only be very submissive in this battle. Furthermore, Ling Han was very despicable, and was merely targeting the Earth Demons and Black Demons. This naturally meant that he was killing one with every strike, and the rate of his massacre was astonishingly efficient.

Not even an hour had passed, and all the Earth Demons and Black Demons were killed off. The heaven and earth grieved together, culminating in a rain of blood that continued without end.

Ling Han, meanwhile, was bathing in the divine blood, the murderous aura bursting forth from his whole body. At this time, he could already fully control the broken wooden sword, making it seem as if this Demonic Tool had turned into a black demonic dragon, exuding endless Demonic Qi.

One man stood there indomitably, wielding two swords.

Even the Heaven Demons were all rendered speechless. They only felt like they really had created a massive problem, actually becoming enemies with such a freak.

If they had known this would happen, why not cooperate peacefully, and merge the two Realms? Then everyone would have a chance of becoming a Celestial being.

Now, it was great. It was a question whether they would even be able to survive this, what more becoming Celestial beings.

“Now that things have come to this, there is no way out!” the Heaven Demon of the Zhang Clan declared coldly. “All of you, use your ultimate attacks. Today, if we are unable to kill this brat, he will become an endless problem!”

All the Heaven Demons nodded coldly. Even if Ling Han could only use this kind of celestial technique once, that guy had a Celestial Tool, and it meant that he was invincible. Furthermore, how could it be that this boy’s cultivation level would not improve further?

Once Ling Han, too, broke through to the Genesis Tier, his battle prowess would naturally be stronger than that of other Demon Masters and Saints. Who asked him to be capable of merging the Regulations of the two Realms?

This kind of enemy was definitely a deadly problem!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

All the Heaven Demons began to burn their life force, sparing no expense. Of course, they only burnt a sliver of it, increasing their battle prowess to a limited extent. After all, they still had the advantage in numbers. There were so many Heaven Demons here, and they were the strongest power of the Netherworld.

Ling Han had clearly evaded them all this while because he was not confident that he could defeat all of them. Now, they were igniting their life force to boost their battle prowess further, which would be enough to suppress him!

Boom!

These Heaven Demons were all blowing out continuously, and the darkness was forcibly blown away, returning this place to more or less normal condition. All of the Heaven Demons had the Regulations of great dao entwined around their bodies, innumerable stars that took the form of Dao Manifestations thousands of meters tall encircling them, being insufferably arrogant.

They were going all out,

Ling Han sneered, “Now it’s time for me to send you all on your way!”

“In your dreams!” All the Heaven Demons smirked coldly, moving out to press their hands on Ling Han. In their tumultuous rage, and adding their battle prowess that was blazing to the maximum, their present might was too frightening. One palm strike from them, and they would be able to shatter a great star.

The strongest power of the Netherworld! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Do you all think that this is my strongest battle prowess?” He opened his mouth, and spat out a flame.

Nine Great Ancestral Flames, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Flames of the Celestial Realm!

“What?!”

All the Heaven Demons paled in shock. Even their Dao Manifestations were trembling. They only felt that this flame was too frightening. The slightest contact with it, and they would be burnt to ashes. There was definitely no other possible result.

What kind of fire was this? Why was it so terrifying?

Ling Han used the Nine Heavens Flame. This was an immortal flame, though it had not truly matured yet. Otherwise, this was an existence that was equal to a Celestial King. Beneath Celestial King, who would not die upon contact with it?

At present, Ling Han temporarily possessed the cultivation of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and the might bursting from the Nine Heavens Flame had also reached the peak of the Netherworld, and was even close to the Celestial level.

This was Ling Han’s true fatal weapon!

With a flick of Ling Han’s finger, multiple finger-like flames shot out, blasting out towards those Heaven Demons.

All the Heaven Demons hurriedly scampered away. This flame was not something that they could hold up against; they were completely on a different level from it.

“Run!” the Heaven Demon from the Gou Clan squeezed out through clenched teeth. There was no longer any significance to continuing the battle. Merely this flame alone was something that they could not dispel, and furthermore, Ling Han still had a Celestial Tool, and could disappear at any time. This would only be them risking their lives for nothing.

All the Heaven Demons nodded in disappointment. Just think, they were all the top-tier beings of the whole Netherworld, yet now they were actually forced to flee by a mere Eternal River Tier. This was something that they could not accept.

But if they did not flee, could it be that they would be staying behind to court death?

“Planning to leave even now?” Ling Han sneered, and with a thought, the Nine Heavens Flame spread out endlessly, becoming a massive cage that imprisoned all the Heaven Demons within.

“None of you can escape!” he stated threateningly.
