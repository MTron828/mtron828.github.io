Chapter 1609: Olive branch

This battle was destined to have far-reaching effects, but for the moment, those effects would not be reflected, because the spreading of the news would need time. The universe was too colossal.

Nothing changed in Ling Han’s life. He continued to cultivate, and related the matter of merging the Regulations of the two Realms to the Rain Emperor, Xu Ran, Ding Ping and the others, and they, too, began to attempt to do the same—there were still Regulations of the Netherworld in the Black Tower.

After cultivating beneath the Reincarnation Tree for a month, the Notionless Saint, Ding Ping, Jiuyao, Xu Ran, and the others all shook their heads. They were completely unable to merge the Regulations of the two Realms. The two could not be merged at all. At most, they could just barely coexist, but once they exited the Black Tower, the Regulations of the Netherworld they had grasped would definitely be erased by the heaven and earth of the Immortal Realm.

Only the Rain Emperor was still in seclusion, and two months later, he had successfully merged the Regulations of the two Realms of the lowest tier.

Though it was the very lowest tier, it was enough to shock everyone.

Where there was the first, there would be the second. It was only a matter of time.

Ling Han, too, couldn’t help but be incredibly impressed by this second brother of his. The Rain Emperor did not possess the Black Tower, nor did he cultivate any Celestial King technique. He had accomplished this all on his own, one step after another, creating a wide path that others would gasp in shock at.

This was a true prodigy of martial arts.

Previously, everyone had the alchemical pills that Ling Han had left behind. Thus, they were all close to the Eternal River Tier by now, and with an Alchemy Emperor by their side, added with the fact that they themselves were prodigies, there was no need to worry about the comprehension of cultivation level. Even if they wanted their rate of cultivation to slow down, it was not possible.

Ling Han nodded. Once everyone had advanced into the Eternal River Tier, he would be able to consider improving the pill recipe so that the medicinal effects would not be so powerful, which would allow all of them to be able to use it. Of course, the fact that the medicinal effects were so violent also showed how powerful the effects could be, and if he adjusted the pill recipe, it would definitely lead to a great decline in the medicinal effects.

He was again busy, studying pill recipes every day, or discussing the art of formations with the Tranquil Heart Saint while he continued to accumulate Origin Power. Breaking through to the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier was close at hand.

Another three months later, the Empress finally took a crucial step, and had formed 1,000,001 stars, officially advancing into the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier!

This drew a heavenly tribulation, but because the Empress had nine doppelgangers, she could distribute the attacks that she sustained, which was equivalent to weakening the might of the heavenly tribulation by 10 times. Furthermore, her nine doppelgangers could also simultaneously parry the heavenly tribulation, and the joined forces of the 10 of them would further weaken the heavenly tribulation by another 10 times, which was equivalent to her only having to sustain 1/100th of the might of the heavenly tribulation.

It naturally was a piece of cake.

Next, Ling Han was finally prepared, and also advanced into the consummate level, and began to endure his own heavenly tribulation.

His heavenly tribulation would be frightening to others as he had to shatter his own Godly bones so that they would be tempered during the heavenly tribulation.

Weng, a golden path suddenly descended from the galaxy, and saintly might abruptly pervaded the area.

The Star Sand Saint and the other Saints all appeared. The visitor was definitely a Saint.

“I am Blue Feather, and I come from the White Rainbow Forbidden Land.” The golden path dispersed, and a Saint appeared. However, there were also three juniors behind him. They were all in the Eternal River Tier, each of them having the bearing of giants among men. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Greetings, Senior!” The Star Sand Saint bowed. This was a Saint King!

The Blue Feather Saint King nodded. He looked towards the skies, and when he saw how Ling Han took the initiative to shatter his own Godly bones to be tempered by the heavenly tribulation, he couldn’t help but show a sliver of shock. Even a Saint King like him would be gaping with shock at this scene.

“This boy... is Ling Han?” he asked.

“In reply to Senior, precisely!” the Star Sand Saint replied respectfully, his heart also slightly depressed. At first, he was the strongest elite in a few hundred galaxies, and even when many Saints saw him, they would have to respectfully address him as senior.

But now, he had become a junior as the visitor was a Saint King.

The Blue Feather Saint King was silent for a moment, and then said, “It is rumored that a few people of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land all died here?”

“Yes,” the Star Sand Saint said concisely yet comprehensively, though his heart shook. The news of the previous battle had finally spread to the various Forbidden Lands.

“Tell me the details of the battle,” the Blue Feather Saint King commanded.

The Star Sand Saint related the battle from the beginning to end, and did not add the slightest bit, nor did he detract from it the slightest. He merely described the battle from his point of view. Furthermore, he even withdrew his own memories to reconstruct the situation at that time.

Seeing two Saint Kings working together to attack Ling Han, yet instead ending up killed by Ling Han in three moves, the Blue Feather Saint King couldn’t help a drastic change in his expression.

Before this, though he had already confirmed the news of two Saint Kings dying in battle, he still had some doubt, and thought it was possible that some powerful Forbidden Lands had made their move, and used Ling Han’s name to kill the two Saint Kings.

But now he could confirm that his previous guess had been wrong. This young man was awfully powerful.

Behind him, the three young people also showed expressions of shock. They really couldn’t believe it; a man whose cultivation level was even lower than theirs actually managed to slaughter Saints, and the person slaughtered was even a Saint King, and furthermore, it was not just one!

The Blue Feather Saint King withdrew his expression of astonishment. He already decided to maintain good relations with Ling Han, and smilingly said, “Merely his enduring a heavenly tribulation is so shocking, no wonder he possesses such enigmatic methods.”

He did not speak any further, obviously wanting to wait until Ling Han finished enduring the heavenly tribulation to converse with him.

The Star Sand Saint did not dare to take the initiative to speak up, and neither could he leave. He could only stand on one side, his heart even more suppressed. By now, he was close to becoming a specialist escort, and it could be expected that the Blue Feather Saint King was only the first; there would be more Star Sand Saints arriving.

Half a day later, Ling Han had completed enduring the heavenly tribulation, and by channeling a drop of Indestructible True Fluid, his body was instantly reformed, completely unscathed. This naturally brought another surprise to the Blue Feather Saint King and the others.

“Young friend!” The Blue Feather Saint King beckoned Ling Han over, all smiles.

Ling Han descended, and greeted with clasped hands, “Greetings, Senior!”

The Blue Feather Saint King paused slightly, and then continued, “Young friend, your military successes are formidable, managing to even slaughter Saint Kings. I do not dare to put on the airs of a senior in front of you. If you are angered, and kill me as well, what am I to do?” When he said the last words, he was smiling. Naturally, he was deliberately joking with Ling Han.

“You can just call me big brother,” he said.

The three juniors from the White Rainbow Forbidden Land all froze. In their hearts, the grand elder had always been solemn and austere, and he was absolute authority. Yet now, they actually saw him joking around, making them feel as if their perceptions of the world were about to crumble.

Furthermore... big brother?

Gasp!

Ling Han also grinned, and answered, “Then I will humbly oblige.” He had killed Saint Kings, and furthermore, it was not just one, so if he continued to put on the act of a junior, it would instead cause the Saint to feel uneasy.

Though he was now only in the Eternal River Tier, what if he suddenly flew into a rage, and again became powerful?

Ling Han conversed with the Blue Feather Saint King for a very long time, mainly about the matter of merging the two Realms. The White Rainbow Forbidden Land had not joined the Heaven Crushing Alliance, but it did not hinder them from being strong, nor did it hinder them from knowing how to open the doors to the Celestial Realm.

Before this, everything was mere fantasy. They naturally had no interest in joining the Heaven Crushing Alliance, but now that Ling Han had appeared, especially when he had even killed Saint Kings, the White Rainbow Forbidden Land naturally set their hearts on him.

They were determined to board this ship, and even if the merging of the two Realms ultimately failed, they would be able to enter into the Celestial Realm via Ling Han’s help.

Thus, this time, it was the Blue Feather Saint King himself who appeared personally.
