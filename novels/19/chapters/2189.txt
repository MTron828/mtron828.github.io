Chapter 2190: Summit

The Rain Emperor’s experiences were naturally very rough.

After he’d begun his lone journey, he had done odd jobs in powerful clans before, had been a disciple in inferior, minor sects, had also been quick to repay debts of gratitude and vengeance, had been forced deep into the mountains, and had become a loner.

However, he was extremely resilient. He had always been able to walk out of multiple dilemmas, and became stronger and stronger.

The Rain Emperor’s luck was not too bad, either. When he attained the Fourth Severance, he entered into an ancient site, and obtained a Natural Peach Seal, allowing him to achieve the Fifth Severance, and after advancing into Dividing Soul Tier, he obtained the remains of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, which he then refined into his own body.

What kind of benefits did that have?

He achieved Dividing Nine Souls!

To accomplish this, it was not absolutely necessary that one had to have nine Source Powers of heaven and earth. For example, Ji Wuming had also formed nine divided souls with the Celestial King imprint from his last life, but Ling Han had not become a Celestial King in his last life, nor had he obtained any Celestial King remains, so he could only rely on the Source Powers of heaven and earth.

In comparison, using the Source Powers of heaven and earth to form nine divided souls was definitely superior. Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could only stand equal to the heaven and earth instead of truly being capable of replacing the heaven and earth.

Later, the Rain Emperor joined the Great Majestic Sect, and very soon climbed from the position of an external disciple all the way to become a Holy Son. With his domineering air and strength, he definitely left his competitors far behind, causing all the other Holy Sons to pale in color next to his brilliance.

Thus, he met with the combined targeting of a great many Holy Sons, which ultimately took the form of killing intent at Dragon’s Gate Mountain as they launched an attack on him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, the Dragon’s Gate Mountain was very unique. Everyone’s cultivation level would be suppressed to the Mountain River Tier, and the Rain Emperor had created his own techniques, forming his own path. In a situation of his cultivation level being suppressed, he would instead become stronger.

Added with Ling Han’s help, they had sent the six Holy Sons into panicked flight.

Ling Han couldn’t help but muse inwardly that this second brother’s luck was actually overwhelmingly strong. He clearly did not have any heaven-defying treasure, nor was he a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King, yet he still managed to attain Dividing Nine Souls.

As long as he could break through the barrier of Heaven Soul, the Rain Emperor would be able to form nine divided souls as easily as splitting bamboo, looking down on all Immortal Palace Tiers. This was a height that even the Empress and Hu Niu could not reach.

Ling Han was sure that there were indeed doted sons of heaven and earth in this world. Of course, the Rain Emperor himself was an extraordinary prodigy of cultivation, and this was an undeniable fact.

The Dragon’s Gate Mountain really had a variety of different tests of willpower. Thankfully, all of them either were monarch tiers, or had something that supported their determination. Their willpower was like a sharp blade that became stronger and sturdier through being tempered.

Seven years later, they could finally see the summit.

Everyone looked overjoyed, and hurriedly increased their pace. They could see that there was a stone doorway at the summit, and it looked quite ordinary, but hundreds of beasts were engraved on the doorframe, and they all looked vivid and lifelike.

“These are all Source Beasts,” someone said slowly, “the creatures that were born at the beginning of the heaven and earth. They carry a natural intimidating air, and even if they are merely engravings, it can still be felt. Furthermore, aside from heaven and earth, there is not one person that can carve out the image of a Source Beast.”

Ling Han had heard that theory before, and nodded internally. That was why it was said that the Dragon’s Gate Mountain was nurtured by the heaven and earth. This was clear evidence.

Now, it was only the last step that was left: leaping over the Dragon’s Gate.

Ling Han’s gaze swept by. He actually spotted a few familiar faces.

“Brother Ling!” Someone walked over, clasping his hands in greeting towards Ling Han.

Yulan Fenghua.

His expression was filled with confidence—not too long ago, he had successfully broken through to the Immortal Palace Tier, and was presently a First Secret elite. After he had leaped over the Dragon’s Gate, he would be further improved in all aspects. In the future, it might be that he could even become an equal of the Imperial Void Celestial King.

Who was the Imperial Void Celestial King?

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King. In fact, he could possibly become a Heavenly Venerate in a few more epochs.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “So it is Brother Yulan.”

Yulan Fenghua couldn’t help but ask, “After we leave, why don’t we have a spar?”

In the past, when they had entered the Lost Land from the Ancient Realm, both he and Ling Han were clearly Dividing Soul Tiers, yet he was clearly no match for the latter.

This was something he could not accept, and now that he had broken through to the Immortal Palace Tier, he thus issued a challenge to Ling Han.

He was not planning to use his superior strength to bully the weak, and merely wanted Ling Han to admit that he was outmatched, satisfying his pride.

“Sure,” Ling Han replied casually. This person had repeatedly nurtured sinister designs against him, and he could not help but want to kill him too. As for the Imperial Void Sect… with how prodigious he was, as long as he had changed his identity, and showed off a bit of himself, he was confident that they would not close their doors on him.

“Ling Han!” A soft exclamation rang out, and An Ran, too, arrived elegantly, glaring angrily at Ling Han. “You owe my master a great debt of gratitude, yet you actually turned your back on us. Are you even still human?”

Ling Han sighed softly. Towards Shang Zhiwei, he indeed felt grateful, apologetic, and a little hateful. His feelings towards her were very conflicted. He shook his head, and said, “Regarding Aunt Wei, there will come a day when I will make my explanations to her.”

“Ungrateful vile character, die!” An Ran ignored him, and moved directly.

Boom!

The Rain Emperor moved, blocking An Ran’s blow. “You want to touch my fourth brother? You have to get through me first!”

An Ran was surprised. Though her cultivation level had been suppressed, she was still a super monarch tier. Even an ordinary monarch tier would stumble back in retreat from this blow, but the Rain Emperor had parried hers easily. In fact, her arm was even numb from the force. Just how domineering was this?

She was not to be trifled with, either. Immediately, she charged towards the Rain Emperor with a soft exclamation.

Peng, peng, peng.?The two of them battled fiercely. The Rain Emperor was pulling no punches in his attacks, sending An Ran back in continuous retreat.

There naturally were people who knew An Ran here, and they couldn’t help but watch in shock. Who was this incredibly domineering man? He was really too awesome.

Meanwhile, An Ran was completely filled with disbelief. In a battle of equals, she would actually be the one being suppressed!

It should be known that even Shang Zhiwei had said that she herself was also not much stronger than this at this stage!

Then didn’t this mean that the Rain Emperor was even stronger than Shang Zhiwei in her youth?

She did not believe it!

An Ran’s battle cry did not die out. She was determined to defeat the Rain Emperor.

Ling Han looked at the Rain Emperor, and looked at An Ran. A strange thought suddenly popped up in his mind: could these two become a couple?

“Leap over the Dragon’s Gate!” He gathered his idle thoughts. With how domineering the Rain Emperor was, he naturally had his own mind. There was no need for him to be overly concerned.

The women were all eager to give it a try.

Now that they had reached this place, it could be said that they had completed 90% of the journey, but as the saying went, the closer one was to completing a task, the tougher it got. If this last leap was not accomplished, then the carp would still be a carp, and could not become a dragon.

And the last leap was not simple, either. It was not everyone that could succeed.

Their belief had to be determined.

Some leaped over, and turned into dragons, flying down the mountain, while some fell off the mountain, howling in pain. They naturally were smashed into bits, with no hope of reprieve.

The women all had determined, resolute expressions. At this moment, their willpower was as strong as Divine Metal, love supporting them.

They definitely could not fail.

They began to leap over the Dragon’s Gate one after another.

Ling Han’s hands were clenched tightly into fists. He was concerned about all of them.

First, it was Zhu Xuan’er. With a leap, she crossed over the Dragon’s Gate, and her body was immediately extended, turning into the body of a dragon, but her limbs did not change much. They merely took the form of dragon clawed paws. Her four paws grasped at the clouds, and after circling once in the air, she left towards the foot of the mountain.

Then, it was Li Sichan, Liu Yutong, Helian Xunxue… Each woman passed the test successfully, and when the last woman, Shui Yanyu, also crossed over the Dragon’s Gate successfully, Ling Han finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Cheng Zixin, Yan Xianlu, and the others also leaped over the Dragon’s Gate one after another, turning into dragons that descended the mountain.

“Brother Ling, I’ll take my leave first,” Yulan Fenghua said smilingly, striding towards the Dragon’s Gate. His white robes fluttered gracefully, with him looking incredibly poised and confident.

With a light leap, he immediately turned into a green dragon that danced through the air.

“Second Brother, stop fighting,” Ling Han said to the Rain Emperor.

“All right!” The Rain Emperor was very decisive, and turned around suddenly. Tossing An Ran off his tail, he leaped over the Dragon’s Gate and left.

“Don’t even think of leaving!” An Ran was not willing to give up, and set off in hot pursuit.
