Chapter 2150: Almost insta-killed

With the attack of a strong enemy, An Ran naturally did not have the leisure to search for Ling Han’s whereabouts, or think about exactly where the latter had gone.

As she battled, she retreated, fleeing off farther and farther.

“Hu, I finally tossed her off my back.” Ling Han came out of the Black Tower, and breathed a long sigh of relief. Now, he was really free to go anywhere he wanted.

“Yi?” His brow immediately furrowed in a frown as he sensed a familiar aura was rapidly rushing towards him.

“Ling, Han!” Lin Xuan released a furious roar, and he charged over from a distance. With him stabbing his spear into the air in front of him, suddenly the force of the spear took shape, and shot towards Ling Han like a sharp arrow.

As this spear attack swept past, the ground around him all cracked, showing how frightening this blow was.

Or was it rather that the surroundings of this place were extraordinarily sturdy? Otherwise, with such a sweeping blow from a First Secret monarch tier, this place would have long since been turned into a great pit that was as deep and wide as an ocean.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then did not enter into the Black Tower. Instead, he turned around and ran.

To enter into the Black Tower whenever he got into trouble was not advisable.

“Can you run?” Lin Xuan smirked coldly, pursuing him relentlessly.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and drew out the Divine Demon Sword. He turned around and delivered a slash, the Sword Qi alarming.

Even if Lin Xuan was a First Secret monarch tier, he did not dare allow this strike to land on him. However, his strength was too powerful. He merely clenched his fist and shot out a punch, and this streak of Sword Qi was shattered, and his speed only paused for just a slight moment.

Just how wide was the gap in speed between the Immortal Palace Tier and Dividing Soul Tier?

Lin Xuan quickly closed the distance between the two of them. His right hand wielded the spear, while his left hand was free as he blasted out an attack at Ling Han.

At present, his jealousy was on full throttle, and there was no one around, either. Even if he killed Ling Han, there would be no one who would know. He could just blame it on those ferocious beasts. What would it have to do with him?

Die!

A vicious light flashed through Ling Han’s eyes as well. He actually turned against the flow, and greeted Lin Xuan’s attack head-on.

Peng!

The force of the punch reached him. This was a blow that could break Four-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal from its force, but when it landed on Ling Han, it did not cause any kind of damage, and only sent Ling Han flying backwards.

Weng, weng, weng.?Void Space unfolded, and Ling Han switched out. Immediately, he appeared behind Lin Xuan, and sent out his own punch.

“Hahahaha, I have already seen this move before. Do you think I will have no precautions in place?” Lin Xuan countered with a smirk. He sent out his spear in a reverse stab. It was fast, accurate, vicious, and ruthless, showing fully the strength he possessed as a monarch tier.

Ling Han was neither angered nor shocked, and was presently gathering momentum for a super storm.

Great Clash of Source Powers!

The Great Clash of Source Powers was created from combining five Source Powers of heaven and earth, so how great would its might be? It was enough to explode a hole in the Void!

Immediately, Lin Xuan paled in great shock. This attack was so terrifying that it was completely unimaginable to him.

He admitted that Ling Han was very strong, being capable of sustaining a few blows from even a First Secret monarch tier, but he absolutely did not think that Ling Han’s battle prowess could actually threaten him. But when this attack was launched, he immediately sensed that if he was hit, he would be dead beyond a doubt.

But he had underestimated his enemy too far!

Yes, he knew that Ling Han’s physique was astonishingly tough, and also knew that the latter possessed an ability allowing instant movement. Thus, this counter from Ling Han was completely within his expectations. However, precisely because of this, he had been careless, because he had not taken Ling Han’s strength to heart at all.

Thinking of dodging only now? How could that be!

Boom, a great explosion took place in the air, and the area within the surrounding five kilometers was completely flattened.

However, when the storm of energy stopped, Lin Xuan was still standing, and there was a seal with an indescribable shape flickering behind him, exuding a supreme aura.

The seal bestowed by a Celestial King had just managed to block that fatal blow.

As expected, though the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King had left, how could he be completely unprepared? With the protective Regulations personally bestowed by a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, even an Ascending Origin Tier could not possibly kill Lin Xuan.

Of course, now that the Celestial King Tier seal had been used, its power would begin to disappear. Thus, this was a last resort to save his life, and could not be used easily.

Lin Xuan stared at Ling Han in shock, his face bearing an expression of absolute disbelief.

He, a monarch tier of his era, a great and noble Immortal Palace Tier, had actually almost been killed by a mere Heaven Soul, and it would be an insta-kill at that!

…He was still blowing his own trumpet. If he had not been given a power boost from the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King, how could he possibly be exclaiming in shock at this moment?

This person… was too dangerous!

Lin Xuan’s expression was filled with shock, but the killing intent in his heart had already reached a point of no return. At this moment, no matter who appeared, no one would be able to stop him from killing Ling Han. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Without killing this brat, he would not be able to rest or eat in peace.

“Die!” He charged out once more, but since he now knew that Ling Han had such a frightening deadly move, he naturally had prepared himself as well. If he made the same mistake twice, he would not deserve the name of a monarch tier.

Of course, Ling Han sent out another strike of Great Clash of Source Powers, yet Lin Xuan managed to leap away in time, and left the attack range of this move far behind him.

“What’s wrong, not daring to take the blow?” Ling Han grinned widely. “I have taken all your strikes head-on, yet you don’t dare to face my attacks head-on. What kind of Immortal Palace Tier are you?”

‘F***, it’s not me that is weak here, but rather that you are too freakish!’

What Dividing Soul Tier’s attack could penetrate the defenses of an Immortal Palace Tier, and pose a threat to the latter? And how many Dividing Soul Tiers would have defenses that could hold up to even the attack of an Immortal Palace Tier?

Ling Han was the only one!

How could there be such a freak in this world?

And Lin Xuan could not retort, either. It was indeed he, an Immortal Palace Tier, that was dodging, and not daring to face Ling Han’s strike head-on.

He was really going to kill himself with his depression.

“Die! Die! Die!” Lin Xuan had learned his lesson, and did not approach Ling Han further. Instead, he delivered his attacks from a distance. He was superior to Ling Han by a major tier, and even if there was such a wide distance between them, he could still pose a massive threat to Ling Han with such long-distance attacks.

On the other side, Ling Han’s Great Clash of Source Powers was limited by distance, and could no longer become a threat to Lin Xuan.

In this manner, Ling Han was instantly in a crisis.

Ling Han no longer lingered in battle. The Great Clash of Source Powers could only be an unexpected move, and if he could not deal with his opponent with a single blow, he would have no further chances afterwards. If he still had another Source Power of heaven and earth, he could just enter into the Black Tower, and directly cultivate to the consummate level of Dividing Nine Souls before coming back out.

By then, he would be equivalent to the First Secret Immortal Palace Tier, and he would then be able to turn around and oppress Lin Xuan as easily as mowing down weeds.

“Still trying to escape? No way!” Lin Xuan set off in pursuit. There was absolutely no way he was going to let his opponent leave.

Today, Ling Han definitely had to die!

Ling Han ignored him completely, and only used his movement technique, moving as fast as lightning.

Lin Xuan used all the means at his disposal, but Ling Han’s methods of ensuring his own safety were varied and plentiful. Void Space allowed him to have thousands and thousands of mirror images, while the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll allowed him to sustain attacks that were above his limits. When the Indestructible True Fluid channeled, he could instantly return back to the prime of his health from a near-death state.

One pursued, while the other fled. Seven days passed, and Lin Xuan couldn’t help but feel shocked. In such a long time, he actually failed to capture a mere Heaven Soul.

His killing intent burned even brighter, while he was also filled with curiosity about Ling Han. This person had to have some massive secret to him, or how could he possibly be so freakish?

He would kill this guy, and snatch his great fortune for himself!

Thus, he strengthened his resolution. He had completely dismissed the idea of seeking the treasure that was possibly within this Mystery Realm from his mind, and focused on pursuing Ling Han. He was sure that if he captured Ling Han, his gains would surpass all else.

Another half month later, an unknown coldness suddenly rose up in Lin Xuan. A blood-red fog was wafting right ahead, and this filled him with endless chills. Involuntarily, he stopped moving.

If he chased into this fog, he would definitely die. This was his instinctive feeling.
