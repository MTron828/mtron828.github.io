Chapter 1489 Clash of Bulls

The seven rank three king tiers had naturally advanced into the top 16. Meanwhile, there were no underdogs among the top 16. Apart from the rank three king tiers, the Rain Emperor and the Notionless Saint had also managed to advance. They had both silently broken through to the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Otherwise, there was no way they could have defeated opponents who wielded powerful and high-level God Tools.Taking them into account, four of the top 16 king tiers had all come from Joint Peace Planet. This was absolutely astonishing.

However, it was a shame that Ding Ping and Jiuyao hadn’t managed to make it into the top 16. After all, their cultivation levels were still too low. Meanwhile, Xu Ran hadn’t advanced to the Eternal River Tier or pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier, either. Thus, even though he was extremely talented, he still appeared quite ordinary when compared with the plethora of king tiers in the academy.

They drew lots again before being divided into two separate brackets. Each bracket would have one victor, and these victors would battle for the title of the strongest.

Only the final victor would receive rewards. The other people would all be stepping stones.

Ling Han observed their situation. He and Empress Luan Xing had both been assigned to different brackets. However, Empress Luan Xing and Gu Daoyi were in the same bracket. This meant that it was extremely likely that they would eventually come across each other. They were destined to fight an intense battle.

Meanwhile, the Rain Emperor was also in the same bracket as Empress Luan Xing. As such, there was little chance that he could emerge as the victor of that bracket. After all, he still had yet to advance to the Eternal River Tier.

Although the other bracket didn’t have Gu Daoyi, it was still stacked with tremendously powerful individuals. There was Long Xiangyue, Second in the World, and Hong Ma. In fact, Ling Han’s next opponent was none other than Second in the World.

This was definitely going to be a ferocious battle between supreme king tiers.

However, Long Xiangyue immediately ran over and pointed a slender finger at Ling Han’s nose, saying, “I’m definitely going to defeat you. So, don’t lose before the semi-final!”

She could only meet Ling Han if they both advanced to the final battle of their bracket.

Second in the World was standing beside them, and he couldn’t help but grimace. ‘Are you just going to ignore my feelings?’

Ling Han smiled faintly. Both Long Xiangyue and Second in the World had already advanced to the Eternal River Tier. It could be said that they were powerful opponents.

“Where are the adults of your tribe? Have any of them broken through to become True Dragons? I want to purchase a dragon horn from you guys. I’m open to any requests and discussions,” Ling Han said.

‘H-he still dares to raise this issue?’

Long Xiangyue’s expression grew even darker. Someone in her tribe had indeed broken through to become a True Dragon. That was her aunty. She was a supreme prodigy of the Long Tribe, and she was more so breathtakingly beautiful. In fact, she was even more beautiful than Long Xiangyue.

Was Ling Han not satisfied with her?

‘Pei, pei, pei! I’ve got nothing to do with him!’

“You’re trying to target my aunty? In your dreams!” she said coldly. This stinky man was truly greedy.

Ling Han didn’t know about the strange rules of their tribe, so he couldn’t help but grumble in his mind. ‘I didn’t do anything untoward, so why are you treating me with such hostility?

‘I didn’t say that I was trying to snatch a dragon horn, either. Rather, I’m proposing a fair exchange. Is there any need to become so angry?

‘Women, what mysterious beings.’

“Ling Han, I’ve been yearning to battle against you for a long time!” Second in the World said, his voice booming like thunder.

His physique was astonishing, and he looked much like a barbaric bear. Standing before him, Ling Han looked much like a young child.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Then let us battle to our heart’s content!”

“Heh, as you wish!”

They still had yet to battle, but there were already sparks flying between them. This sent waves of excitement through the people standing in the surroundings. They were eager to see these two king tiers do battle straight away. The battle between them would definitely be spectacular.

It wasn’t long before the eight battles all started at the same time.

Ling Han faced off against Second in the World. Second in the World didn’t underestimate him. He immediately let out a huge roar, and black hair instantly started to grow from his body.

He had already looked like a barbaric bear just then, and at this moment, he barely looked human anymore. Fangs started to protrude from his mouth, and his fingernails also became long and black. A cold glow shimmered around him, and his physique was enough to instill apprehension in his opponent’s mind. It was as if he were a gigantic beast from the ancient past.

“Iron Bone Barbaric Bear Bloodline!” someone exclaimed in astonishment.

Ling Han’s heart shuddered. Iron Bone Barbaric Bears were Ancient Divine Beasts, and although they were slightly inferior to True Dragons, powerful Iron Bone Barbaric Bears were still Genesis Tier Saints. They were incredibly terrifying.

“Roar!” Second in the World bellowed loudly before aggressively striding toward Ling Han. He was like a battle chariot hurtling toward Ling Han.

The physique of Iron Bone Barbaric Bears was top-notch in the world. These were beasts that could rival even True Dragons.

Ling Han wore a strange expression. His opponent was charging over to engage in close-quarter combat? Where had his courage come from?

Perhaps the physique of Iron Bone Barbaric Bears was top-notch in the world. They could indeed challenge True Dragons to some extent. However, this was merely the case in the Immortal Realm. Ling Han had practiced the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and the offensive ability of this technique was a solid zero. However, its defensive ability... hehe.

‘Come!’

Ling Han also charged toward Second in the World.

Peng!

Neither of them shirked, and it was only natural that they went straight into one another. Both of them were sent stumbling back. They were rank three king tiers, and were both at the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Thus, it could be said that their power was almost identical.

Second in the World shook his head. The collision just then had made him feel a little dizzy. However, he immediately smiled, and said, “Among those at the same cultivation level as me, I’ve yet to come across anyone who dares to battle against me head-on. How many more collisions can you withstand?”

“As many as you want,” Ling Han replied calmly. The collision just then hadn’t affected him in the least.

“Fine!” Second in the World replied with a loud laugh. He charged toward Ling Han again. However, dark light started to emanate from his body as he charged forward, allowing his speed to become quicker and his power to become greater. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t cower, and he also charged toward his opponent.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them continued to collide with each other. These were genuine body-on-body collisions, and there wasn’t anything to cushion the force of their impact.

The spectators were all stunned, yet they found this battle to be somewhat hilarious.

This was a battle between supreme king tiers, yet they were actually charging at each other like two bulls? Where was their demeanor as elites?

However, apart from Ling Han and Second in the World, who else dared to battle like this? Perhaps their bones would all be broken after a dozen or so collisions. After all, just how violent were these collisions?

Nonetheless, the two king tiers continued to charge at each other as if they didn’t feel any pain. Before long, they had already collided with each other over 100 times.

The spectators couldn’t help but feel admiration.

However, which of them could know that Second in the World was actually experiencing unspeakable distress?

He knew that his physique was incredibly powerful, so he especially liked to use these kinds of methods to defeat his opponents. He could completely crush his opponents both physically and mentally. In reality, this was indeed the case when he battled against opponents at the same cultivation level. No one could face his attacks head-on.

Now, however, his vision was blurry and his stomach was in turmoil. He was feeling incredibly nauseous, and it was as if he were about to vomit his guts out.

At this moment, he felt like he was just an ordinary person. Meanwhile, Ling Han was like a boulder. When an ordinary person tried to charge at a boulder, it was much like trying to smash a rock with an egg.

‘F*ck, which of us possesses the Iron Bone Barbaric Bear Bloodline? Can you be more reasonable? How is your physique even tougher than mine?’

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “Again?”

“Of course!” Second in the World gritted his teeth as he struggled on. This type of battle was his strength, so he would have no face to show himself if he were defeated by Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them collided with each other again, and their battle was like a clash between bulls.

However, those with a sharp eye quickly discovered that Second in the World was becoming slower and slower.

As he became slower, the force of his charges naturally grew weaker as well.

Although Second in the World was still stubborn in appearance, he was already becoming afraid of Ling Han in his mind. He couldn’t help but subconsciously reduce the force of his attacks.
