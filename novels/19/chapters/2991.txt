2992 Mysterious Voice

There were hundreds of thousands of dimensions inside Ling Han’s body, and they had all become high-tier high-level dimensions. If he unleashed his full strength, it would be as if hundreds of thousands of Sixth Tier elites were helping him at the same time. His power would be unfathomable.

Casting one’s gaze over the Seventh Tier elites, who could possibly rival Ling Han in terms of power?

In fact, every single one of them could only eat his dust.

However, Ling Han’s actions also meant that he would exhaust all of his potential while he was still at the Sixth Tier. After advancing to the Seventh Tier, his power would only increase when he mastered a new type of fundamental particle. In addition, his physique would also become indestructible. It wouldn’t be like now, where his power would increase by astounding amounts each time he advanced to the next tier.

Of course, this was unless he raised the dimensions inside him to a higher level.

The transcendent level.

Not every dimension needed to reach the transcendent level, and only three or four of them reaching this level would be fine, just like the Genesis World. At that time, he would be able to channel the power of dozens or even hundreds of Seventh Tier elites. Fighting against others would be like picking on children.

History told Ling Han that it would be impossible to cultivate transcendent dimensions inside his body. However, he had already created a miracle by cultivating hundreds of thousands of dimensions inside his body, so why couldn’t he create another miracle?

“It’s a shame that I’ve already reached the maximum number of dimensions inside my body. And because of the limit of my cultivation, I won’t be able to cultivate these dimensions to a higher level. I can only leave it here,” Ling Han murmured to himself. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hopefully I can still absorb this energy after I advance to the Sixth Tier.”

Ling Han sighed in reluctance.

He completed his cultivation, and continued to move forward.

Since he had already come here, he naturally wanted to see what was hidden behind the 33rd level.

As he walked, he continued to calculate in his mind.

Just then, he had considered strengthening his defenses. The first option would be the simplest option. He simply needed to raise his cultivation level and be tempered by one other type of fundamental particle. At that time, his physique would naturally undergo a qualitative change.

The second option would be to use his Power of Dimension to form a shield.

Of course, the first option was definitely better, since it would solve the problem at the root. His defenses would permanently improve, and there wouldn’t be a need to consciously perform an action.

However, the problem was that Ling Han was only at the Fifth Tier right now. It would be a long time before he reached the Seventh Tier. As such, thinking about these things was a waste of time.

In other words, he could only choose the second option.

He hadn’t been able to do this before, because his dimensions had been too weak—they couldn’t have withstood attacks at the Seventh Tier. Now, however, they could.

With the might of hundreds of thousands of Fifth Tier elites combined together, he could surely rival someone at the peak stage of the Seventh Tier, right?

Ling Han continued to ponder how he could utilize his Power of Dimension to form a formidable shield as he walked forward.

Weng!

Four orbs of earthen-yellow light materialized around him, with each of them linked to the others with a thread of golden light. They formed a triangular pyramid that shielded Ling Han inside.

“With such a powerful defense, even Seventh Tier elites will need to attack it several hundred times before they can break it,” Ling Han said with a confident smile. While they were attacking him again and again, would he not be able to react?

As long as he funneled his power into these orbs, their defensive capabilities would immediately reach a peak again.

This could be considered as another form of invincibility.

Ling Han looked around.

“Hmm? Where’s this?”

Contrary to his expectations, there weren’t any broken dimensions. Instead, it was as if he were in the depths of the universe, where there only existed vast expanses of pitch-black, ice-cold, and empty space. There was a speck of light in the boundless distance, and it glowed with a gentle yet paramount aura. Even though they were boundlessly far apart, Ling Han could still detect this with ease.

This gentle speck of light made him feel an innate sense of closeness.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. Why was this speck of light making him feel like this? One had to realize that his battle prowess was already at the Seventh Tier, meaning that nothing in the world could manipulate his emotions.

“You… have… come…” an ancient voice said in Ling Han’s mind. This was a grand and majestic voice, yet it didn’t carry any feeling of life or emotions.

‘What’s going on?

‘Who’s talking to me?’

“After enduring for so long, you’re here at long last,” the voice said again.

“Who are you?” Ling Han asked in a solemn voice.

“I’m a seed buried inside your mark of life, and I was only reactivated after returning to this place,” the voice replied.

This thing was inside him?

Ling Han’s hair stood on ends.

F*ck! What did they think he was? Why did they all want to bury crap inside him?

First it was Hysteria, leaving a mark on his body during his previous life, and having it follow him through rebirth. And this time? What the hell was this?

‘My body, mind, and mark of life aren’t taverns! You people can’t enter and exit as you please!’

“You haven’t answered my question yet,” Ling Han said. “Who are you? What’s your identity? Where are you from?!”

The ancient voice sighed softly, saying, “I’m not a specific person. I’m simply the undissipated will of a world.”

‘F*ck! What a mysterious-sounding answer.’

Ling Han was just about to speak.

Weng!

Countless images suddenly flashed through his mind.

He saw intense battles, he saw rivers of blood, he saw… Chong Yan, Shatter Mountains, and the other Seventh Tier ultimate elites—including Yellow Sand who had already died—battling against a woman in black.

Jue Huo! Also known as Extermination!

Extermination was indescribably beautiful as always, yet she was also as cold and ruthless as could be. She was battling against six Seventh Tier ultimate elites, yet she was still enjoying the upper hand. Elsewhere, there were two armies locking horns, and all of the soldiers were at the Heavenly Venerable Tier. Countless elites were wounded and killed.

This was a Realm War, and this scene was exactly the same as their battle against Hysteria.

However, Hysteria was far more hideous, and its opponents were now Lin Luo, Xin Fu, and the other new Seventh Tier elites.

Ling Han was even more astonished. Just what in the world was going on? He was actually witnessing the Realm War from the Genesis World of the last era? What did this have to do with him?

Afterward, he saw something that he already knew about.

Yellow Sand sacrificed himself to forcefully contain Extermination. Meanwhile, Chong Yan and the others detonated the Genesis World to unleash an attack that far exceeded the Seventh Tier.

In the end, Extermination was shattered into pieces. Because Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand wasn’t the focus of the attack, his body hadn’t been destroyed. However, his divine sense was completely obliterated.

At the same time, the Genesis World also collapsed, with all of the dimensions shattering at the same time, and instantly killing countless beings. This created an unfathomable power that broke the dimensional barriers and pushed all of the dimension fragments into the void. This power increased layer by layer, and it was a magnificent power that even Seventh Tier ultimate elites were far inferior to.

The life power of these dimensions was also buried. Because this power was so concentrated, it gradually transformed into Great Herbs that were incredibly useful to Heavenly Venerates over time. Fragments of the dimension core also remained, and these transformed into the Heavenly Venerable Seals.

As it turned out, this was the origin of the Great Herbs and Heavenly Venerable Seals in this place.

Ling Han also saw Chong Yan and the other Seventh Tier elites being struck and severely wounded by this unfathomable power of destruction, which caused them to enter a state of slumber. They only managed to recover after slumbering for a very long time.

When they were buried inside the depths of the shattered dimensions, countless specks of light materialized and entered their bodies.

These specks of life were most likely the marks of life of the prodigies of the Genesis World of the last era. Indeed, it was because of the marks of life that they were able to take a human form after absorbing enough energy.

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han suddenly faltered. What did Chong Yan and the others say before? That it was them who had protected these marks of life to win a sliver of hope for the future? However, what Ling Han saw was a completely different story. The five of them had already fallen into a deep slumber, so how could they have possibly done this?
