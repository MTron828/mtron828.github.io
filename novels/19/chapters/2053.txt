Chapter 2054: Plains

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel speechless. This little girl was really the jealous type. Even after having spent so many years with the Empress and the others, she had not changed her original aspirations. Whenever she got the chance, she would want to monopolize him.

“Be good!” He rubbed Hu Niu’s head.

Hu Niu pouted, appearing very unhappy. However, Ling Han soon made her smile again as she related her experiences on the dragon bridge.

As expected, she had also encountered Dragon’s Breath, but there were no Blooms of Dao.

Going by that reasoning, it was possible that there would be no Dragon’s Breath on the normal bridges, or the Dragon’s Breath would be pitifully weak.

The two of them waited for a while, and then they saw the Empress step off the dragon’s head with an incredibly graceful bearing. Her charms were uncomparable, and could easily make anyone submit to her.

“Hu Niu, big witch!” Hu Niu pouted her little mouth, appearing very displeased about seeing her.

Another two days later, Bewitching Maiden Rou also appeared.

Ling Han looked at her, and the corner of his mouth involuntarily twitched.

Bewitching Maiden Rou had not come alone, but was rather surrounded by at least a dozen men. Furthermore, every single one of the men had an ingratiating expression on his face, as if they wanted nothing more than to surrender their very souls for her.

When she spotted Ling Han, Bewitching Maiden Rou couldn’t help but smile dazzlingly, a hint of pride curling up the corners of her lips.

‘See, what do you think of my charms?’

“Let’s go!” Ling Han did not even give her any regard. His left arm wrapped around the Empress, his right held Hu Niu’s small hand, and he turned and left.

“Wait for me!” Bewitching Maiden Rou hurriedly leaped off the dragon’s head, and chased after Ling Han, which made those over dozen men show expressions of jealousy and hatred.

What right did he have?

They had curried favor with her throughout the journey, and fought to step in front of her whenever there was danger. Meanwhile, Ling Han clearly did not do anything at all, yet their goddess still chased after him. How could they tolerate that?

“Hold it right there!” A young man leaped out, standing in the path of Ling Han and the others.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Step aside!”

“If you had the ability, how could I manage to block your way?” this man declared proudly. He was clearly provoking him.

“Scram!” Hu Niu ordered.?Peng, she shot out a punch, and that man was instantly sent flying. In a mere instant, all that was left of him was a tiny black dot.

“Do any of you still want to block the way?” The little girl swept a glance at those remaining, her eyes extremely fierce.

Those remaining hurriedly shook their heads in unison. They all felt glad that they had not been that rash. Otherwise, they would have ended just like the man just now.

…There were Regulations of Gravity here causing suppression. No one was capable of flying here. Thus, after having been sent flying so high, it was very likely that he might be smashed to bits upon landing. By then, he would definitely be deader than dead.

Ling Han smiled, and set off again, his hands holding the hands of the two women with him.

Bewitching Maiden Rou hurriedly set off in pursuit. Her head was low, looking like a little wife who had been wronged.

This side of the cliff was connected to an expansive plain. This time, it really was a plain. The grass was half a foot high, and there was no end in sight. It looked like a green ocean.

And in the endless distance, there was a Divine Dragon hovering in the skies. Even if there was an endless distance between them, they could still sense waves of dragon’s might spreading out, causing one’s heart to soar and submit.

However, this was not a real Divine Dragon, but rather a mountain peak. It was just incredibly steep, so it looked like a dragon.

Ling Han and his party then set out towards that Divine Dragon mountain. This was also the direction in which the others were heading.

This plain was really too wide. Even if they were advancing in the same direction, they soon were separated. Just like the myriad of stars dotting the skies, they were also scattered all over this plain, the distance between them farther and farther.

They continued forwards. In any case, there was that Divine Dragon-like mountain acting as a landmark ahead of them, so there was no need to worry that you would lose your way. This ocean-like plain felt very novel to them at first, but when enough time passed, they naturally would be bored of it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Roar!

All of a sudden, a black shadow streaked out from the bushes. That was a black panther, its body covered in purple-colored light patterns, and as it pounced, there was a beauty of brilliant lights and flowing colors coming from it. It aimed straight for Bewitching Maiden Rou.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was annoyed. Its first target of attack was her. Did it think that she was going to be an easy target?

“Haha!” Ling Han laughed loudly. “You are indeed the easiest to bully.”

He did not move, because this black panther wasn’t too strong.

Bewitching Maiden Rou exclaimed softly, and moved to counterattack the black panther.

Peng, peng, peng.?Human and panther were embroiled in an intense battle, and it was actually very hard to tell which of them was better.

This black panther was at Yin Soul, having very strong battle prowess close to the standards of king tiers. Thus, even if Bewitching Maiden Rou was an emperor tier, and could still be invincible even with a gap of a minor level, she was still unable to defeat it, at least not very soon.

Hu Niu was yawning in boredom. Watching this kind of battle was making her very sleepy.

“Witch Rou, Niu’s coming to help you!” She shot out a punch.?Pa, this black panther was instantly sent flying.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han and the Empress both looked surprised, because the black panther actually hadn’t been killed by Hu Niu.

…Since the little girl had already moved, she had to have calculated the strength of this black panther. She should have killed the black panther directly with a single punch, but the result was completely different. This punch had only sent the black panther flying.

This defense was quite amazing.

Peng, the black panther crashed into the bushes. It struggled to get back on its feet, and just barely managed to.

Though it had not died, Hu Niu had still inflicted a serious injury on it.

“Who asked you to bully me!” Bewitching Maiden Rou pounced, and struck heavy blows to it. Now that the black panther had sustained serious injury, it naturally could only be beaten submissively in her hands. But even so, it had still been hit at least 100 times before finally dying.

“This hide is really tough!” Ling Han walked over. He tried out the defenses of the black panther, and it had reached about Earth Soul in level. No wonder it only came off with a severe injury even after bearing a blow from Hu Niu.

“Niu wants to eat roast meat!” Hu Niu was beginning to drool.

Ling Han skinned and removed the tendons of the black panther, yet surprisingly discovered a crystal in the black panther’s head. It was green and translucent, and dragon’s might was vaguely seeping from it.

“Why would there be dragon’s might?” The four of them were all surprised.

“This is the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm, where, it is said, 100 Divine Dragons have been buried. They were all Celestial King Tiers. In that case, there would definitely be a considerable amount of benefits left behind, enough to cause a transformation in the living creatures here,” Ling Han deduced.

“Is this edible?” Hu Niu stared at the crystal, and licked her lips.

This little girl judged if an object was useful or not by seeing if it was edible or not.

“This is a Dragon Crystal. Its effects are weaker than those of Dragon’s Breath, but it still has some benefits after refining,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

Oh, was that right?

Ling Han put the Dragon Crystal away. Since it was useful, it naturally could not be wasted.

They continued onwards, and saw the great plain was gradually disappearing, and the rise and fall of mountains had appeared in front of them. There were also small patches of forest and craggy rocks scattered all over.

No wonder a black panther had appeared just now. As it turned out, they had entered the area of a mountainous forest.

A harsh cry rang out, and they saw a massive golden condor fly across the skies. However, its claws were very strange. They were not the normal claws of birds, but rather five-clawed dragon paws. Golden light was reflecting from them, as if they were metallic in nature.

This harsh cry turned into a blade that sliced over at Ling Han and his party. It was about as long as a mile. As the blade swiped past, large swathes of trees were violently cut down, and nothing could stop its advance.

Ling Han humphed, and clenched his hands into fists. Then, he, too, gave a loud shout.?Boom, a frightening storm of energy surged out from his body, pouring out diagonally ahead of them.

Great Clash of Source Powers!

As the storm of energy surged past, a cone-shaped area of vacuum suddenly appeared ahead of them, and the sound wave blade that the golden condor had shot out was also broken, sweeping past on either side of Ling Han and the others without causing the slightest bit of harm.
