2663 Wang Clan’s Invitation

With the time acceleration effects, Ling Han advanced to the eighth level of Indestructible Celestial King Physique in only 17 years. However, the amount of resources that he required in order to progress one step further would be astronomical.

Ling Han planned to concoct alchemical pills, and proceed to sell them.

At this moment, he received an invitation from a major force.

Although he had received many invitations before, all of them were just sending him compliments, with subsequent requests to befriend him. However, this invitation was different as it directly stated its purpose was to help Ling Han sell his alchemical pills.

This triggered Ling Han’s interest as concocting alchemical pills was just a means for him to obtain cultivation resources—if he could be relieved from the selling part, then he would be most willing to do so.

He gave it some consideration, and then decided to go to this appointment.

This major force was known as the Wang Clan. The grand elder of the Wang Clan was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate from the Flash Passion Realm and also the greatest elite of that realm. He had arrived in this realm very early on, and brought many clan members along with him.

After so many years, the Wang Clan had already been firmly established this place, and greatly expanded their influence.

Within the Wang Clan, aside from the grand elder, there was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate by the name of Wang Ande, who was at the moment resisting Hysteria alongside the grand elder in the Realm Battlefield, while the one in charge of the clan’s affairs was Wang Qianyang, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

However, the Wang Clan did not just invite Ling Han. To be exact, a descendant of the Wang Clan had just broken through to the Celestial King Tier, and thus the Wang Clan invited guests from various realms, especially outstanding disciples of the martial academy.

This descendant of the Wang Clan was also quite well-known, going by the name Wang Jiayue. She was known to be a stunning beauty with amazing natural talent in cultivation. This time, she would be enrolling in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy after breaking through to the Celestial King Tier.

It was said that this young lady of the Wang Clan had many suitors, but she nevertheless had high aspirations, and had never shown any signs of affection to any man. However, there were also rumors that Wang Jiayue already had someone she admired, and thus did not pay any attention to other suitors at all.

The Wang Clan was located in a faraway place. However, as the invited guests this time were mainly disciples of the martial academy, the event was held within martial academy grounds. After all, Wang Jiayue was about to enter the martial academy, so this banquet was also held with the intention to make her presence known.

Ling Han just traveled for a short while before arriving at the place where the Wang Clan’s banquet was held. The place was an abode where a junior member of the Wang Clan resided. Now, he was already an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, and his strength naturally ought not to be underestimated.

This place was absolutely unlike the Celestial King Graveyard; every disciple here would have the aptitude of a Monarch Tier at the very least.

The reputation of the Wang Clan was great indeed. After all, they had a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate as grand elder and a great elite in the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, so there were many people who came, and a great number of disciples actually took pride in having received invitations from the Wang Clan.

Ling Han kept a very low profile. He handed over his invitation card, and quietly entered the venue. He helped himself to drinks while waiting quietly.

Once the Wang Clan had received his invitation card, they would have known that he had arrived, and hence someone would eventually come out to meet with him and discuss the details of selling alchemical pills on his behalf.

Ling Han sat there, drinking, and watched people come and go. Many people were greeting one another and building connections. Usually, everyone would have been preoccupied with cultivating. This was therefore a rare opportunity. However, there were also many people like Ling Han, who would sit by coolly while ignoring the others.

“Y-y-you…” An exasperated voice sounded in Ling Han’s ear.

Ling Han turned his head, and saw that this person was somewhat familiar, but he didn’t seem to quite remember, so he asked, “You are?”

Zhuo Kai was nearly angered to death. The misery that Ling Han had caused him! Yet, Ling Han didn’t even remember who he was? He gritted his teeth, and said, “I’m Zhuo Kai!”

Ling Han thought about it for a bit, and then said, “Oh, you are Zhuo Kaizi!”

Ling Han finally remembered: this person was the second-generation young master whom Ling Han had taught a lesson when he initially entered the martial academy. The other party was extremely arrogant due to having a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate as a grand elder.

Zhuo Kai was fuming with rage. “I’m Zhuo Kai, not Kai Zi!”

“It’s not much different anyway,” Ling Han said with a smile. Of course, this kind of second-generation young master wasn’t worth his time in his eyes.

Zhuo Kai humphed, and said, “Ling Han, don’t think that I can’t put you in your place! My grand elder is coming back for a break from the Realm Battlefield. When that time comes, we’ll see if you can still be as arrogant!”

Ling Han frowned slightly. “I didn’t want to be bothered with you, because to me, trash like yourself is not worthy, and yet here you are, getting on my nerves, and thinking that I dare not put you in your place?”

He moved directly, laying a hand down on Zhuo Kai.

Almost 100,000,000 years had passed. Ling Han had already become a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, while Zhuo Kai was still the same as before. He couldn’t dodge the palm strike at all even when he saw it coming.

Pa, Zhuo Kai was heavily slapped across the face with a crisp sound. Immediately, half of his face was crushed, leaving behind a bloody chin; the sight was terrifying and disgusting.

Zhuo Kai shrieked in pain, immediately attracting the attention of others, who all cast their eyes towards him.

“Hey, isn’t that Ling Han?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“And Zhuo Kai.”

“That Kaizi went to stir up trouble again? Hehe, this time he had really hit a wall. Who is Ling Han? He even stepped on Heavenborn’s face; he is the most impressive among this year’s batch of disciples.”

“Didn’t you know that Lord Zhuo Bing is going to take a break, and will be coming back from the Realm Battlefield?”

“Oh, no wonder this brat dares to be so arrogant! Hehe, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and having returned from the bloody battle of the Realm Battlefield, his battle prowess cannot be compared with one who had just broken through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. No matter how freakish the Celestial King, he can only respectfully and with reverence greet him ‘Lord’ when they meet.”

“So Ling Han may be feeling great at this moment, but if Lord Zhuo Bing gets angry, then the former will be punished.”

Everyone was engaged in a spirited discussion, and quite a number of people was even more gloating at Ling Han’s misfortune. After all, Ling Han had suddenly risen too fast, causing many people to feel green with envy.

Ling Han couldn’t care less. If Zhuo Bing came back to give him a hard time, then he would bring the black donkey out. The large black dog had such a close relationship with it; there wouldn’t be any problem to bring it out to give people a scare.

At this moment, the sound of jingling bells from girdle ornaments was heard, and a whiff of fragrant perfume came through. A young lady stepped out from the inner courtyard, dressed in a green palace dress and with jet-black hair cascading like waterfalls. Her skin was white as snow, and she was stunningly beautiful and ethereal.

As soon as this young lady appeared, she immediately attracted the attention of many people, and all of their eyes were burning with desire.

She was the main character of today’s banquet, the beloved daughter of the Wang Clan, Wang Jiayue.

“Celestial maiden Jiayue!” Many people called out, appearing quite fanatical.

Even with Ling Han’s high standards, he couldn’t help but give a nod of approval and call her a beauty. It was obvious that this woman was indeed astonishingly beautiful. It was no wonder that she was the beloved daughter of the Wang Clan, and was being admired by countless people.

Wang Jiayue greeted everyone with a curtsy and a sweet smile on her pretty face, but nevertheless did not pay attention to anyone, appearing quite arrogant. As her gaze quickly swept towards Zhuo Kai, she couldn’t help frown, and asked, “What’s going on?”

An incident causing injury to another actually happened at her dinner banquet. This was disrespectful to the Wang Clan and to her, Wang Jiayue.

Naturally, there would be someone rushing to flatter, and recounted to her what had just happened.

Wang Jiayue instantly expressed her dissatisfaction, and said to Ling Han, “Young Master Ling, whatever grievances that you may have against Young Master Zhuo can be resolved outside. This is the Wang Clan, after all!”

Ling Han smiled. “Alright, I will take note of it next time.”

In his eyes, Wang Jiayue was just a pampered little girl, and he didn’t want to bother stooping down to her level.
