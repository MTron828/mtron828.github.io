Ling Han entered into the Black Tower, and sat down with crossed legs. Then, he gripped the Mountain River Stone in his hand.

After entering this place, he, an invincible existence in the Shattering Void Tier, could only depend on the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique and the Black Tower to spring traps on others, and no longer possessed the image of invincibility. This made him extremely displeased.

Now, he was filled with an incredible thirst for power.

He would first advance into the Mountain River Tier, then go out and thrash that bunch.

Advancing from Shattering Void Tier to Mountain River Tier was a qualitative change, a true metamorphosis from mortal to immortal.

Without talking about anything else, even Shattering Void Tier would only have a lifespan of slightly more than 1,000 years, but what about Immortals? A cultivator of the low extreme of the Mountain River Tier would have a lifespan as long as 100,000 years, and every next advance of a minor level would increase his lifespan by another 100,000 years.

And after advancing into the Sun Moon Tier, his lifespan would be counted in millions of years.

Hence, whether it was the advance of a minor level or a major cultivation tier, it was a massive transformation.

Without entering into Immortal level, he would only be an ant in the end.

Ordinarily speaking, taking this step would need several months, years, or even more than a century, but with a Mountain River Stone now in his possession, it was extremely simple. After refining it, he would advance into the Mountain River Tier. However, there was a limit to this kind of Mountain River Tier. He would not be able to advance past the low extreme, and still required his personal comprehension of the cultivation level.

One hand holding onto the Mountain River Stone, Ling Han began refining.

Weng , an unknown energy surged out of the Mountain River Stone, and directly took effect inside his Dantian, stimulating an amazing change inside his body.

His Spiritual Ocean was drying up, his Spiritual Pedestal was deteriorating, and the inside of his Dantian had very quickly become a mass of ruins.

To bring new life amongst destruction.

This realization suddenly arose in Ling Han’s heart. From mortal to Immortal was a qualitative change; hence, he needed to cast away his old body.

The great ocean ebbed completely, leaving behind a wasteland, and in this wasteland, a sliver of life slowly came to be.

Hong, long, long. The ground was trembling, and some kind of change was brewing beneath it.

The more essence of the Mountain River Stone Ling Han drew on, the more obvious this change was. Finally, when he had completely refined this Mountain River Stone, the ground split apart as if a terrible earthquake was occurring. Then, from beneath the ground, a huge— no, a small sharp peak emerged.

Hong , Ling Han only felt his whole body shake. This small sharp peak was exuding a powerful energy, which was remolding his body.

This was the mountain of Mountain River Tier?

A muscle in Ling Han’s cheek twitched slightly; this was a bit too small, wasn’t it?

However, he had only refined a single Mountain River Stone. How could he possibly manage to reach the middle stage or the middle stage of the low extreme in an instant?

“I am already in the Mountain River Tier now?”

Ling Han stood up, yet abruptly felt an intense hunger within him. This was not his stomach being hungry, but rather his body, which was filled with hunger for more power.

He hurriedly grabbed a large pile of Spiritual Herbs, and began eating like crazy as he continued to purify even more of the Spiritual Herbs with the Heaven Transformation Bowl. Then, he poured it into his mouth to fulfill the demands of his body.

From mortal to Immortal, how humongous this step was? Ling Han could finally understand. After all, if he were to swallow these Spiritual Herbs a day before... he would burst from being overnourished even if there was only a ten thousandth of the amount.

But now, he only felt a terrible hunger as if he were about to starve to death...

Once about half of the Spiritual Herbs planted in the Black Tower had been consumed by him, this feeling of hunger finally disappeared. Instead, there was an indescribable feeling of power replacing it.

It was really too strong, at least a few hundred times the power of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier!

Xiu , Small Tower appeared. It was moving lightly, and said, “To advance in this manner is not beneficial to your cultivation.”

“I know!” Ling Han nodded. “However, I am now in a rush to give someone a thrashing, so we can only do this. When I go back, I will cultivate once more from the beginning.”

Small Tower nodded, and continued, “However, you still have advanced into the Mountain River Tier, so the fourth floor of the Black Tower can be opened now.”

“The floor of Fire!” Ling Han was pleasantly surprised.

“That’s right. You can use Divine flame in the Black Tower to temper your spirit and physique to a whole new level,” Small Tower said.

“Can’t I use it outside?” Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a frown.

“For the moment, no.” Small Tower swayed from left to right; this meant a shake of the head. “As long as the tower is not mended, you will only be able to use a portion of the might of the Black Tower, and this is a very small portion.

“Now, you can go and pass the heavenly tribulation,” Small Tower continued.

The Black Tower was very amazing as it could even block the tribulation. This was really an absolutely independent space of its own.

Ling Han nodded, and flashed out of the Black Tower. Abruptly, he could see the red clouds disperse, and black clouds came rolling out in waves. The brilliant white light of lightning was flickering in the sky.

The heavenly tribulation was coming.

Ling Han was unafraid. He would make use of the power of the tribulation to temper his Godly bones, and improve his physique so it would reach the level of Level Two Godly metal.

“Yi!” In the vicinity, a young man appeared. At first, he looked surprised, but then he immediately released a large shout to summon his companions.

He was a member of the group of seven from before. They had not managed to find Ling Han, yet were not satisfied to miss out on this “fateful opportunity”. Hence, they had left one of their group to stand guard nearby, wanting to know whether Ling Han would suddenly reappear or not.

They had really managed to anticipate that moment.

The man was slightly surprised. Ling Han actually managed to refine the Mountain River Stone in the short time of a single day and complete the breakthrough. However, he was just a Mountain River Tier cultivator that had just broken through, so how much battle prowess could he actually possess?

He did not make a move. If he dared to disturb the tribulation of another, he would incur the ire of the heavens and earth, and end up pulled in to experience the tribulation together. This was definitely not good news.

Moreover, what need was there for him to be in a rush?

After passing the tribulation, Ling Han would definitely be severely injured—this was him speaking from experience. Thus, he was in even less of a rush to make his move.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Very quickly, his five companions leaped over in quick succession as well. When they saw Ling Han was about to pass a heavenly tribulation, they could not help but smirk coldly.

You hid yourself, so we couldn’t find you, but now, you were actually stupid enough to undergo a tribulation here? That really was courting your own death.

Hong , a bolt of lightning was already descending from the sky.

Ling Han stood proudly. The thing he feared the least was the tribulation—his physique had already crossed over into the Mountain River Tier in advance, and the might of the tribulation would definitely only be in the early stage of the low extreme. Otherwise, how many people would be able to survive?

Kuang, kuang, kuang. Bolts of lightning descended one after another. Ling Han basked in the divine lightning, and took the initiative to let it disintegrate his physique to temper it with the divine lightning.

The divine lightning could not harm him, but it was a different case if he were to take the initiative to disintegrate his own physique. His Godly bones were broken by force, transforming into uncountable pieces; experiencing the barrage by the lightning, they were improving and advancing further.

In the future, every time he increased his cultivation level, there would be another experience like this?

Or so Ling Han thought. This was absolutely a cruel torture!

“That’s right. Every time you advance a minor level, you’ll have to experience a tribulation and another tempering of your physique,” Small Tower responded. “Only with that would your physique be refined and polished to perfection, becoming indestructible and invincible. At the same time, every experience of tempering is also a polishing of your spirit.”

“Couldn’t we get some Divine Pills that could allow one to instantly advance into the Genesis Tier?” Ling Han said mockingly.

“Where would be the fun in that?” Small Tower countered.

“There is indeed none,” Ling Han replied, smiling. His eyes were bright; he was beginning to structure his Godly physique.
