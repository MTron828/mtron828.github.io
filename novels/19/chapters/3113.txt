Li Changdan, a proud prodigy.

He was only 21 years old, but he had already opened nine meridians. No one in the Ancient Dao Sect could surpass such a young person of Nine Meridians.

This was a man who was born with a halo around him. He was destined to be brilliant and dazzling.

If Ling Han hadn’t appeared, he would definitely have been made the Dao Child and inherited the legacy of the Ancient Dao Sect. He would have been able to obtain the core inheritance and reach the peak of existence.

Unfortunately, Sun Jianfang had brought back a Divine Stone which had actually nurtured a person. This had caught Li Changdan off guard, and might have even caused his status as the Dao Child to fly away.

He was naturally displeased with Ling Han, but he was extremely shrewd. In the Ancient Dao Sect, who would dare to make a move under Sun Jianfang’s nose?

Fortunately, Ling Han had only just started, and was still far inferior to him.

Li Changdan didn’t believe that before Ling Han caught up to him, those elders of the sect would agree to make Ling Han the Dao Child.

The Dao Child would represent the next generation of a sect. Of course, they had to establish the one who was strongest and had the greatest potential as the Dao Child.

The changes in this world had just begun, and the path to immortality was an endless one. They were only standing at the starting point, and the resources should naturally be spent on the most suitable people.

Such as Li Changdan!

Thus, after learning that Sun Jianfang had given Ling Han three Meridian Guiding Fruits, even with Li Changdan’s shrewdness, he still couldn’t bear it. As he instructed, the matter of He Miaoyin inviting Ling Han to the banquet happened.

Of course, it was so that he could make things difficult for Ling Han. It would be best if he could humiliate Ling Han to the point that the latter could no longer stay in the Ancient Dao Sect. At the very least, he had to make Ling Han’s reputation stink. If that happened, how could he continue to become the Dao Child?

“Come, Junior Brother Ling, let me introduce you,” Li Changdan said with a smile. He was gentle and refined like a modest gentleman, and people couldn’t help but have a favorable impression of him.

“This is Rui Yuanliang, Senior Brother Rui,” he said, pointing to a young man beside him. This person was about 24-25 years old, and his face was filled with arrogance, as if he did not take Ling Han seriously at all.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Senior Brother Rui.”

Rui Yuanliang only snorted softly, and raised his chin slightly as a form of greeting.

Ling Han sneered in his heart. ‘Is it really okay for you to be so arrogant?

‘What’s the big deal about you?’

“Senior Brother Rui is Elder Qi’s son-in-law. His natural talent in martial arts is quite extraordinary, and he’s already an elder of Eight Meridians now,” Li Changdan continued.

Rui Yuanliang revealed a reserved smile and nodded slightly at Li Changdan.

‘Oh, so he was a freeloader that was living off of his wife. What was there to be arrogant about that?’

“This is Lao Liyan, Senior Brother Lao,” Li Changdan introduced again.

Ling Han was too lazy to even nod. These people were all arrogant, and they seemed to be either the descendants or in-laws of the elders. They thought that their status was so very noble, so why should he be bothered to act polite to them?

“Humph, how arrogant!” Lao Liyan said in dissatisfaction.

These people were all too selfish. Didn’t they know who was the one who put on airs first?

“This junior brother is really arrogant,” another man said. “Don’t think that you can be arrogant just because Lord Sect Master dotes on you!”

Ling Han glanced at him, and asked, “And who are you?”

“Tan Gaobo,” the man said proudly.

“Never heard of you,” Ling Han said calmly, and then turned his face away.

“You…” Tan Gaobo and the others were furious. No matter how much Sun Jianfang thought highly of Ling Han, the latter had only stepped onto the path of martial arts for less than a month. Naturally, he should maintain absolute respect and modesty in front of these senior brothers.

Moreover, they were all the descendants and in-laws of the elders. Just how high was their status?

‘As long as you are not the Dao Child, what right do you have to be arrogant in front of us?’

“Alright, alright.” Li Changdan waved his hand to stop the conflict from intensifying. “Junior Brother Ling is young and impetuous. Don’t blame him.”

This seemed to be speaking up for Ling Han, but it was actually pointing out his arrogance. It was equivalent to adding fuel to the fire.

Ling Han looked at this young prodigy from the Ancient Dao Sect. He was young, but his shrewdness was truly profound.

Tan Gaobo and the others all wore displeased expressions, and their gazes towards Ling Han were filled with disgust. In their eyes, Ling Han was only a lucky person. Because he had been born from the Divine Stone, he had inexplicably obtained Sun Jianfang’s favor.

It was too unfair.

They looked at each other, and then sneered. They would definitely make a fool of this kid and ruin his reputation.

“Junior Sister He has come!”

Right at this moment, someone spoke, and a woman in red walked out surrounded by four beauties. They were all wearing off-shoulder dresses, revealing fair shoulders. One could see their proudly bulging breasts presenting an extremely alluring sight.

This couldn’t help but cause many men to howl like wolves and cheer with all their might.

The woman in red was He Miaoyin, today’s female lead. She walked to the middle of the hall, and said a few opening words before announcing the start of the banquet so that everyone could have fun.

Ling Han had no interest in paying attention to anyone, and just sat at the side. Huan Xue, on the other hand, was doing her job as a little maid. Once Ling Han gave the word, she would go and bring over Ling Han’s favorite food.

This made everyone envious. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

By now, everyone had heard about what had happened. Huan Xue had defeated Zhang Baichuan who was a Two Meridians, so she at least had the strength of Two Meridians.

In this era, cultivators were the most precious resource. Regardless of their cultivation level, they were superior in status, yet Huan Xue was actually serving Ling Han like a maidservant, willing to work without complaint. How could this not make people envious?

The banquet continued, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. There were no more conflicts, which surprised Ling Han greatly. There was actually no one who came to provoke him?

This didn’t make sense. He was someone with a halo of trouble.

When the banquet was about to end, He Miaoyin returned to her room. However, when she appeared again, her pretty face was icy. The door was immediately closed, and the music stopped playing.

“What’s going on?”

“What happened?”

Everyone was curious and started asking around. After a while, they were all in a commotion.

It turned out that He Miaoyin’s Meridian Guiding Pill had been stolen!

It was said that this Meridian Guiding Pill was a gift from He Guan to his granddaughter for her birthday in attaining adulthood. Now that it had been stolen, He Miaoyin was naturally enraged.

Now that the door was closed, the meaning was obvious. The thief was among them!

“I’m sorry, everyone. We’re going to search everyone now.”

Although everyone was dissatisfied, they couldn’t afford to offend the He family. Moreover, they didn’t have a guilty conscience, so they naturally didn’t mind being searched so they could prove their innocence.

Ling Han raised his eyebrows slightly. Could this be a plot against him?

When someone walked over and wanted to search him, he didn’t object. He just strictly paid attention to whether the other party took the opportunity to frame him.

To his surprise, he completed the body search smoothly.

Was he thinking too much?

“Found it!” A voice rang out. A woman was standing beside Huan Xue with a bottle in her hand. There was a pill inside.
