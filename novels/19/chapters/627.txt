Chapter 628: An Ugly Person with an Even Uglier Heart

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han already walked past the entrance, with a sturdy man leading them towards the place of the banquet.

“Brother Han, it was you just now, right?” Li Feng Yu’s sister was constantly watching indifferently from the side, yet suddenly spoke up.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Don’t you accuse me wrongly!” He certainly activated the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow and gave Zuo Qiu Le Cheng a shot. It should’ve been extremely covert, but she actually saw through it.

Li Feng Yu laughed loudly, and said, “In front of my sister, don’t you think of concealing any secrets. She’s naturally endowed with an extremely shocking perception.”

“Brother!” Li Feng Yu’s sister said, displeased. They’d just met, and he already divulged her trump card.

Li Feng Yu coughed, and said, “Come, let me introduce you, here is my sister Li Zi Xian. Sigh, she’s soon to pass twenty, but hasn’t found a husband yet. Her standards are beyond reach, with no genius or exceptional talent to her liking, worrying this brother to death.”

As expected, Li Big Mouth!

“Brother!” Li Zi Xian couldn’t help but blush and stomp her feet.

Ling Han laughed loudly. With such an older brother, what sort of experience would it really be like. He also introduced himself. “I am Ling Han, this is my friend Zhu Xuan Er, and this is Hu Niu. That over there is the ruffian rabbit.”

“Ruffian what? You in charge of who’s a ruffian? Your freaking uncle— ah!” The rabbit was immediately displeased, but being bitten on the tail by Hu Niu, it instantly screamed in pain.

The Li Siblings were instantly shocked. This large white rabbit actually opened its mouth to talk?

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Yes, this damned rabbit knows how to talk.”

“Let go, Uncle Rabbit’s tail that was grown out with great difficulty can’t get any shorter!” the rabbit screeched.

“Don’t be rude to Niu’s Ling Han!” Hu Niu chided it.

“I really don’t know what’s so good about this guy!” the rabbit muttered.

The Li Siblings still hadn’t come back to their senses from such a shock, feeling their outlook on life collapse. There was actually a beast that knew how to talk... they actually forgot to think about the now obvious fact that Ling Han used a pseudonym.

Under the sturdy man’s guidance, they soon arrived at the lake, seeing long tables set up here. Food and fine wine filled the tables, yet there was not a single chair.

People held plates and fetched some food from the table, walking while eating, and occasionally drinking wine.

For martial artists, standing for a few days wasn’t tiring, so it didn’t matter whether there were chairs or not. Without a fixed seat, people wouldn’t be displeased because someone else had a better spot. Moreover, walking while eating could make everyone communicate and converse better.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. Although he hadn’t met Wang Family’s pearl, her remarkableness was already demonstrated.

Seeing so many people, Li Feng Yu’s heart of gossip immediately burned fiercely as he said, “Brother Ling, Lady Zhu, Sister, you guys find a place to eat, I’m going to find a few people to have a chat!”

Without waiting for Ling Han and the others to respond, he already dashed out—if he suppressed it any longer, he’d have internal injuries.

‘Poor Zuo Qiu Le Cheng,’ Ling Han said inwardly, yet secretly enjoyed it—served him right for being such an unpleasant person!

“Eat! Eat! Eat!” Seeing so much food, Hu Niu’s eyes instantly glowed, but after smelling it with her small nose, she couldn’t help but be disappointed. “It’s not fragrant at all!”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Its free anyway. Can’t be many good things if its free, just eat casually.”

“Alright, Niu will eat casually.” Hu Niu sighed.

The two came to a table and began to fill their plates, instantly frightening people on the sides. Were you guys the reincarnation of hungry ghosts, filling up such a tall plate, not afraid of bursting?

“Eat casually.”

“Yes!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Hearing the two eat and talk like this, the people nearby were speechless. Wang Family took out a great deal this time. Many foods were made from high-level beast meat and fourth tier and fifth tier spirit fruits; taking any bit of it would sell for a sky-high price.

However, as these two people saw it, it didn’t apper to their liking at all. More importantly, one should eat less if it wasn’t to one’s liking, yet they still filled up so much.

After a while, Zuo Qiu Le Cheng also walked in. This time, he didn’t have the coachman accompanying him. Walking alone, he’d already restored his calm, and became that arrogant genius earlier.

However, everyone immediately pointed at him, discussing animatedly, and many people even wore a disdainful look.

This bent man!

Zuo Qiu Le Cheng almost passed out from anger. He only arrived a little late, yet Li Feng Yu had already spread his “orientation” to the whole place? Li Big Mouth, truly too big of a mouth!

He forcibly composed himself and thought that rumors stopped with the intelligent. The more he argued, the more unclear it would be.

A fragrant breeze could be smelled as a girl walked over; after she glanced over Zhu Xuan Er’s face, she spoke bitingly, “Tsk, looks pretty good from afar, but this face, sigh. This great physique was really given to the wrong person.”

Zhu Xuan Er didn’t take it to heart. Her appearance was unparalleled, definitely the number one in the world, rarely seen in ten thousand years. Moreover, a girl would dress up for the man who loved her; her beauty needed only blossom for Ling Han, and she’d never thought of letting others admire her exceptional beauty.

Ling Han’s gaze, however, turned cold. With his temperament for protecting those close to him, even if Zhu Xuan Er was only a normal friend, he wouldn’t allow her to suffer the slight of others, let alone now that the two of them were close to being a couple?

“Ugly girl, what did you say?” Ling Han tossed a glare.

“U-ugly girl?” That girl’s expression turned pale, and she immediately burst into anger. He dared to insult her as an ugly girl? She was Jing Shuang Shuang, and countless men were intoxicated by her, but now, someone actually called her ugly to her face?

“Not only is your face ugly, your heart is ugly too, ruined my appetite!” Ling Han sighed.

People said “a feast for the eyes”, but now, she actually ruined his appetite... so how ugly did she have to be to have such destructive power?

Jing Shuang Shuang trembled in anger, feeling that Ling Han’s words were truly like ice, not only cold, but cutting her painfully! She saw Zhu Xuan Er’s figure from behind earlier, and instantly felt put to shame and unable to compare with that beauty that was in the other’s bones.

She couldn’t help but walk over to get a careful look. Who would’ve expected that Zhu Xuan Er actually had an extremely ordinary face, which instantly relieved her inside, and at the same time, she couldn’t help but mock her.

However, she didn’t faze Zhu Xuan Er, and almost exploded from anger herself.

“Fairy Jing, what’s wrong?” Her escorts immediately surrounded over; there were a dozen in before their eyes.

“This person... wanted to harass me!” Jing Shuang Shuang pointed at Ling Han.

Ling Han instantly shivered, and said, “Hey, don’t disparage my tastes. Even if I had a wolf-like urge, I wouldn’t take a fancy to you. You can dream on!”

Jing Shuang Shuang was about to pass out from anger. How could there be such a person with a tongue like a sharp blade, piercing her all over the body.

“Nonsense!” An escort jumped out. “Hurry up and kneel down to apologize to Fairy Jing, or else, I, Zhu Xiao Tian, will definitely not forgive you!”
