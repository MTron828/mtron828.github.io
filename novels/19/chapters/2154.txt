Chapter 2155: Success!

Cultivate, cultivate, and more cultivating.

15,000 years later, Ling Han formed his sixth divided soul. 22,000 years later, he formed his seventh divided soul.

Within the Black Tower, the flow of time was 100,000 times faster than in the outside world!

What surprised Ling Han was the fact that beyond the fifth divided soul, he did not need any specific item to become a bearer for his divided soul, nor did any heavenly tribulation descend, as if this kind of cultivation level was completely nonexistent.

But Ling Han could indeed feel that every time he broke through, his strength would soar greatly.

But no matter how strong he became, he kept feeling like there was still a long way to go before reaching the Immortal Palace Tier. He could not overcome this barrier no matter how much he tried.

It looked like qualitative change would only take place after reaching Dividing Nine Souls.

30,000 years later, Ling Han formed his eighth divided soul.

There was only the last one left.

Ling Han continued to cultivate, but the final stage was unexpectedly difficult to break through.

100,000 years, 300,000 years, 1,000,000 years… Ling Han was still cultivating hard. He was completely stuck on this stage.

‘No, looks like this is not something that can be broken through to with merely cultivating,’ Ling Han thought, and then said, “There has to be a trigger.

“Great joy, great grief, fury, and fighting spirit all can help me to break through this wall.

“That’s right. That idiot must still be standing guard outside, so I’ll go and play some more with him.”

Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and in a mere instant, he heard a loud laugher.?Hu, a long spear was shockingly attacking, as if it had torn through space, and was instantly piercing towards his chest.

Lin Xuan indeed had not left, and had been standing guard all this while.

1,000,000 years had passed within the Black Tower, but only 10 years had passed in the outside world. To a First Secret monarch tier, this little bit of time spent waiting was naturally no big deal.

“Did you think you managed to deceive me?” Lin Xuan smirked coldly. This brat was really very patient, to have actually hidden himself for more than 10 years. Too bad, his patience was even better!

For the treasure of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, to say nothing of 10 years, even if it was a billion years, he would still have the patience to wait.

What Celestials lacked the least was time.

Ling Han laughed, and raised a fist to parry.

Pu!

A blood-red light flashed over his fist. Even with his physique, he was still incapable of matching the destructive power of an Immortal Palace Tier, and some skin had been sliced. Blood spurted, and he himself was also sent flying.

However, Lin Xuan was astonished.

Ling Han’s strength had actually increased countless times over. Though he had not reached the level of the Immortal Palace Tier yet, he seemed to be just a hair’s breadth away.

‘Impossible!’

No matter how weak an Immortal Palace Tier was, he would be able to suppress the strongest Heaven Soul. This was a reality that would never change for eternity, yet Ling Han seemed to have broken the trend of this reality.

He had already increased his strength by so much just by going into isolation for 10 years, then what about going into isolation for another 10 years, or 100 years?

Was he going to become heaven-defying?

Impossible! Impossible!

Lin Xuan comforted himself internally. An Immortal Palace Tier was definitely capable of suppressing a Heaven Soul, and he was a First Secret monarch tier, stronger than the ordinary First Secret Immortal Palace Tiers by two minor levels, so it was absolutely impossible that Ling Han could turn the tables on him.

“I definitely cannot allow you to live!” His killing intent blazed. This brat was too freakish. Even if he could not break the iron rules of the cultivation world, what if he did really break through to the Immortal Palace Tier?

Thankfully, there was no Mystery Realm for the Immortal Palace Tier here, or he would really have to worry.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Yet Ling Han had no distracting thoughts, and only blazed his fighting spirit as he fought with Lin Xuan.

This battle continued for three months, and Ling Han was completely battered from his battle. Only when he was completely incapable of fighting any longer did he then enter into the Black Tower.

“Ah…” Lin Xuan howled furiously towards the heavens. Just when it looked like he was about to kill Ling Han, the latter had used some kind of method to disappear again, causing all his effort to go to waste, and him to almost explode in fury.

But what else could he do? Only continue waiting!

Within the Black Tower, as Ling Han healed his injuries, he thought back to the battle, causing his fighting spirit to blaze.

Presently, he felt no great joy or grief, and the kind of trash like Lin Xuan could not possibly enrage him, either. Thus, he only had the option of fighting spirit left to him.

Half a year passed inside the Black Tower, and Ling Han charged out. Without wasting words, he launched an offensive against Lin Xuan.

Only a short while had passed in the outside world. Thus, Lin Xuan had not even warmed his seat when he saw Ling Han revitalized and launching an attack at him.

‘F*ck!’

Lin Xuan could only counter immediately, and battled Ling Han.

The time for this battle was much shorter, and only took a month. Ling Han withdrew from battle, and went into the Black Tower. Though this battle had taken a short time, it was more intense, and the injuries Ling Han sustained were no lighter than his previous wounds.

He recuperated for another three months, and then appeared once more to battle Lin Xuan.

Battle, recuperate, battle, recuperate, and he went through this cycle repeatedly.

Ling Han had the Black Tower, and with the time acceleration effects, he had enough time to recuperate, but it was different for Lin Xuan. He had just battled with Ling Han, and had not even gotten his breath back when the latter came back again.

The endless repetition of this not only filled him with weariness, he felt an indescribable irritation too.

And right at this moment, Ling Han’s fighting spirit had also accumulated to the pinnacle.

This time, he began a long period of isolation after entering the Black Tower.

A whole 100,000 years later, Ling Han’s eyes suddenly snapped open. There were nine great daos entwined around his body, exuding a supreme aura.

He had succeeded in Dividing Nine Souls, and he had practically reached a height that no one had reached before him.

By now, he was equivalent to a First Secret Immortal Palace Tier!

Ling Han jumped up to his feet, and laughed out loud. By now, he was equivalent to a First Secret, so when he truly broke through to the Immortal Palace Tier, he would be capable of suppressing ordinary Fourth Secrets at least!

Dividing Nine Souls, even one was rare to come by in a few epochs. If it was not extremely awesome, how could it be deserving of so many Source Powers of heaven and earth within Ling Han’s body?

“I’ll use that idiot as a power test!” This time, Ling Han brought the Empress, Hu Niu, and the other women with him out of the Black Tower. He now had absolute certainty that he could suppress Lin Xuan, and naturally needed not fear having the four women come out.

Moreover, this place had once possessed the might of Heavenly Venerable Tier, and he was sure that even the divine sense of the Spiritual Mountain Celestial King could not possibly touch this area.

“Ling Han!” Lin Xuan called out loudly. He was fuming mad, and even his eyes were bloodshot. “Do you dare battle upfront with me once and for all?”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “Is there something wrong with your brain? Just how many times have I battled with you already by now?”

Lin Xuan completely lost his wits from his extreme fury as well. Indeed, Ling Han fought him fiercely every time he came out, and it was a head-on confrontation, as if he was not weaker than him. But when he fought towards the end, he would always run off. Such cowardly acts could also be considered being upfront and forthright?

He glanced at the Empress and the others, appearing very confused. ‘What is the meaning of this? To actually bring out the people inside your Spatial God Tool? What are you playing at now?’

Ling Han snapped his fingers. “After fighting for so long, there should be a conclusion by now.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Have you decided to accept your death?” Lin Xuan laughed coldly. He was naturally not going to believe Ling Han’s words. This guy would definitely fight for a while, and then disappear without a trace again.

“You had better save these words for yourself!” Ling Han moved.?Boom, nine divided souls showed their might inside his body, pouring frightening power into him, and causing a qualitative change to take place in his battle prowess.

Boom, this strike caused even the weather to rage.

“What?!” Lin Xuan paled in great shock. This attack from Ling Han truly possessed the might of the Immortal Palace Tier.

Hurriedly, he parried with his spear, and the tip of the spear clashed with Ling Han’s fist. A frightening force assaulted the spear, the impact causing him to involuntarily retreat in succession. He finally managed to stop after retreating for a whole 137 steps.

For an elite like himself, retreating one step was a good few miles, so what kind of unbelievable concept was 137 steps?

And looking back at Ling Han, the latter had only retreated 106 steps.

The gap between them… was clear at a glance!
