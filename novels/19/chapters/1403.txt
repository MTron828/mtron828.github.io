1404 Killed with a single slash

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden dared not underestimate him.

She had advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier from the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, so her power could surpass more than five stars but less than six stars. However, according to rumors, the Seven Generals and Left and Right Ministers were all four-star geniuses, and added with the cultivation level of the peak stage of the low extreme and the boost from power of the nation, there should be a two to three-star gap of power between the both of them.

This was not a small gap.

However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s bloodline was special. She possessed the power of a True Phoenix, which could greatly increase her battle prowess. Furthermore, she had also learnt some secret techniques from Ling Han, and all these factors added together should grant her a further increase of one star of battle prowess.

Thus, the gap between the battle prowess of both sides should be about one to two stars, so this fight would be worth fighting.

Sha Jing gave a loud shout, and the divine patterns on the precious saber glowed one after another with his full power. An air of military might channeled out, soaring to the skies and sinking underground in a very terrifying manner.

He was not a super genius, but if it was in mere terms of the numbers he had killed, he could possibly surpass such young king tiers like Ling Han and Chi Huangji. The bloodshed that he had experienced had condensed into an air of slaughter that had taken form. Those with a slightly weaker temperament would crumple with a single touch.

“We go up for the battle!” Sha Jing shot up into the skies, like a shooting star that had swept past, which was going against its natural direction.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden naturally would not fear a battle. The wings on her back shook, and she similarly flew up into the skies.

Boom!

Neither of the two great elites spoke another word. They immediately went into battle positions and began to fight. Shock waves descended one after another, but they were blocked by the protective formation of the Imperial Capital, and the Great Commander of the Imperial Guards, Qu Qiuxue, also stood above the Imperial Capital. She raised her head to look at the skies, an expression of surprise on her face.

When had there appeared another female great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier in the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire?

Furthermore, though she had just stepped into the Heavenly Body Tier, her battle prowess was incredibly astonishing. Though she was not an equal match for Sha Jing, she did not experience too much of a loss, either. She advanced and retreated accordingly, not showing any sign of losing.

Unfortunately, she was on duty, so she did not fly up into the skies to watch the battle. Yet, she still felt a burning curiosity. Where had this woman come from?

“Father!” Zhao Lun called out softly, a disappointed expression as well as a frightening killing intent flashing through his eyes.

Zhao Jianbai glanced at his son, and couldn’t help but give a humph.

He knew what his son was trying to say. He wanted him to kill Ling Han.

He was really too childish!

Ling Han could advance into the Heavenly Body Tier, so could it be that you couldn’t do the same? The moment he was in a dilemma, he would ask this father of his for help. Did Ling Han have a father in the Heavenly Body Tier? He did not yet, he had still broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier so quickly on his own!

Hence, one would still have to depend on oneself.

Zhao Jianbai sighed. Who asked him to have only a single son? Who was he going to help if not him?

“Ling Han, we go up to the skies and fight!” he spoke up, his voice like a battle song, resounding loudly.

Ling Han sat calmly, and asked, “If I move, our empire will have one less elite. Are you sure you wish to seek your own death?”

This...! This...! This...!

Not just Zhao Jianbai, when everyone in the area heard this, which of them did not think that Ling Han was boasting too much?

Zhao Jianbai was an experienced elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, and had immersed himself in this cultivation level for innumerable years, so how could he be matched by you, a rookie who had just advanced into this cultivation level? Furthermore, though all of them were subjects of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire and could draw upon power of the nation, their official rank was different, so the degree of power of the nation they could draw on was also different.

He was just a minor seventh-rank military officer, so how could he compare to a grand Great General?

What a joke.

Zhao Jianbai laughed from extreme anger. “Brat, though it is indeed extraordinary that you have broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier at such a young age, if you underestimate the great powers of this world just because of that, do you not think that is too arrogant? Come, we go up into the skies for the battle!”

“You are still unable to claim yourself as one of the great powers of the world!” Ling Han stated calmly. “Since you want a battle, I will accommodate you!”

He drew that dilapidated wooden sword. Though this thing was only sturdy, it was more than enough to deal with a mere cultivator in the low extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier.

When Zhao Jianbai saw this, his expression involuntarily became livid.

Was this a weapon?

‘It looks f******* more like a stick to poke the coals, and you f******* use this to fight me. Just how much are you belittling me?’

“Good! Good! Good!” His face was livid. “If I do not kill you here, then my surname is not Zhao!”

Ling Han took a step out, his right hand raising the wooden sword, and sent out a slash straight at Zhao Jianbai.

It was extremely simple, merely a strike heading right at him.

Zhao Jianbai was practically frothing blood in fury. At first, he used a battered sword to humiliate him, and now was just sending such a direct slash in such a disdainful manner at him. Did he think he was a weakling? ‘Fine then, if you are so bold, that is your own fault for seeking death!’

His right hand shook, and a sword appeared in his grip, quickly stabbing at Ling Han’s forehead.

Directly aiming for his spirit!

‘What!?’

He was abruptly shocked—this strike from Ling Han was too fast. He had just waved his sword, but in the next moment, it had appeared in front of him. He hurriedly waved his own sword to parry the incoming strike, and was sure that with the sharpness of the Divine Sword in his grasp, one strike would not only immediately sever the coal stirring stick, Ling Han would also be sliced in two and become two halves.

The wooden sword descended. Pa, a crisp sound rang out. Zhao Jianbai’s Divine Sword was actually sliced into two halves, and the wooden sword fell with practically no deterrence. At this instant, a murderous aura surged out of the sword’s blade. It rolled out like smoke in an extremely frightening manner.

Even Zhao Jianbai couldn’t help but shiver. He had killed people like scything flax all his life, fighting on the battlefield, and could claim that he was a butcher. However, in front of this murderous aura, he was completely a junior, and was no match at all.

The wooden sword fell, and he was directly slashed in two, his spirit destroyed as well.

‘What?!’

A powerful Heavenly Body Tier elite had actually been killed with a single slash like that; how was this believable?

Meanwhile, the Left Minister felt his heart constrict strongly. With his insight, he naturally could tell very clearly that Ling Han’s abilities had reached an extent that he could easily overwhelm Zhao Jianbai, and that was why he had been successful with only a single slash. Of course, the murderous aura of this seemingly ordinary wooden sword was actually brimming over, so Zhao Jianbai practically did not even counter in the end.

It was merely icing on the cake. Even if Ling Han had used another weapon, he would also have succeeded, except for the fact that it would only be a slight bit more difficult.

As it turned out... not only had Ling Han advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier, he had even surpassed him.

This would have to be the battle prowess of the high extreme, at the very least. Otherwise, how could he have possibly killed Zhao Jianbai with a single slash!

Ling Han withdrew his sword, and saw that the very ordinary-looking wooden sword in his grasp was actually exuding a dark shadowy light. Even he felt a strong shudder when he saw this, as if this was not a very ordinary wooden sword, but rather a Divine Sword that had fought on the battlefield for countless years.

He knew that this sword was not ordinary, but he had never thought that its murderous aura would be so exposed when it had touched blood. The veined patterns on the wooden sword had visibly become more distinct. The patterns were very simple, yet there was also an indescribable majesty about it.

A sword of massacre, directly destroying the spirit!

He would have to slowly study it in future.

He put away the sword, and turned to look at Zhao Lun.

This proud prodigy was now completely dumbstruck. He had not regained his senses from the fact that Zhao Jianbai had died. He could not accept this. His father had battled for innumerable years, and yet was killed with a single slash from Ling Han.

Only when he was focused on by Ling Han’s icy eyes did he suddenly shudder violently and wake up from his shock.

“You, you actually killed my father!” he said in a trembling voice. Suddenly, he turned towards the Left Minister. “Lord Left Minister, this person killed a Great General of our Majestic Empire, which is no different from committing treason. I beseech you to execute the law of the empire, sir!”

F*** you!

The Left Minister felt a muscle twitch violently in his cheek, and almost cursed. Wasn’t that throwing him into the fire pit as well?ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
