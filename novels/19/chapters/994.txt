Chapter 995: Seed of the Reincarnation Tree

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The auction progressed very quickly.

Everyone had a rough idea of what each item was worth, and thus nothing exceeded its estimated value by too much.

Few people fought over ordinary items as these could all be purchased outside. What was the point of wasting their money on them here?

However, the appearance of truly valuable items would lead to heated competition.

The appearance of the first Mountain River Stone instantly triggered a small crescendo.

In the end, Li Weiwei had the winning bid of 7,000 True Origin Stones. She was about to reach the Mountain River Tier soon, so she could use Mountain River Stones to raise her cultivation level to the low extreme first. After that, she could slowly cultivate to bring her comprehension to the same level. Doing this would save a huge amount of time.

The second and third Mountain River Stones gradually appeared for auction as well. Almost all of the winning bids came from Li Weiwei, Ji Yun’er, and Shui Yanyu. Who told them to be so rich right now?

After waiting for a long while, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle was finally brought onto the stage.

After a brief introduction, the elder announced the starting price. “The Cloud Piercing Shuttle starts at 100,000, and each bid must be at least 5,000 more than the former.”

This was very astonishing. The starting price was already a whopping 100,000!

“110,000!”

“120,000!”

Bids came thick and fast in the beginning as Flight God Tools were not only extremely rare, but also incredibly useful. The bid on the Cloud Piercing Shuttle quickly exceeded 500,000. At this price point, the number of bidders had already decreased dramatically. After all, this was a huge sum of money, and most forces were hesitant to spend so much on a single item.

When the bid reached 700,000, only three bidders were left.

“730,000, going once!”

“730,000, going twice!”

The elder was just about to end the bidding.

“800,000,” Ling Han said.

“800,000, someone has raised the bid to 800,000!” The elder was overjoyed. The more the item sold for, the more commision he would receive.

“810,000!” Someone on the third level raised the bid again.

“900,000,” Ling Han said casually. In this auction, the Cloud Piercing Shuttle was the only item that he was determined on obtaining. In fact, he even wouldn’t hesitate to spend all of his True Origin Stones.

His rival hesitated for a moment before saying, “910,000.”

“1,000,000.” Ling Han raised the bid to an insane level.

This time, no one raised the bid anymore.

After all, genuinely large forces naturally owned Flight God Tools already... though no one would complain about having too many Flight God Tools. However, 1,000,000 True Origin Stones was already the highest limit. This kind of Flight God Tool would appear every few years, so what was the point of overpaying right now?

“Hehe, next up, we have a mysterious item for auction.” The elder gestured with his hand, and a beautiful woman instantly walked on stage with a tray in her hand. There was a small pouch resting on the tray.

This woman was extremely beautiful, and she was wearing a low-cut dress that revealed large swathes of her snow-white skin. Even part of her seductive and voluptuous assets was visible. However, no one gave her a second glance, as their attention was all drawn to the small pouch on the tray.

That was the mysterious item for auction. What did the small pouch hold?

“Has anyone heard of the Godly Tree—the Reincarnation Tree—before?” The elder swept his gaze around the arena.

“What Reincarnation Tree? I’ve never heard of it before.”

“I’ve never heard of it, either. What kind of Godly Tree is it?”

Most people shook their heads. It wasn’t that they were ignorant or ill-informed, but rather that this so-called Godly Tree was definitely too unknown. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t tell me... Don’t tell me that it’s that Reincarnation Tree!” someone suddenly yelped. He was an elder who was seated on the bottom level. His hair was all white, and so was his beard too.

Someone beside him hurriedly asked, “Elder Zang, do you know this Godly Tree?”

This elder had lived for hundreds of thousands of years, yet he was still only at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. It was almost impossible for him to break through to the Sun Moon Tier. However, his old age coupled with his love for reading ancient books meant that he was quite renowned for his knowledge.

“According to legends, the Reincarnation Tree is a Godly item that doesn’t belong to this world. It can bring our divine sense on a journey, and a fraction of a second in the outside world is enough for one to experience three full reincarnations. This is an extremely mysterious item.”

“Gasp! Then won’t one be able to comprehend any cultivation technique if they use this Godly Tree to cultivate?” Everyone exclaimed in astonishment upon hearing the elder’s words.

This was far too astounding. Any force would go crazy to obtain this kind of treasure.

Which idiot had put this treasure up for auction?

Ling Han’s heart also thumped in excitement. He had taken a small sip of Reincarnation Tea before, and that had allowed him to experience one full life. As a result, he had been able to comprehend the profoundness of the Shattering Void Tier much earlier than anticipated. Moreover, it had caused his divine sense to become far stronger than that of others at the same cultivation level as him.

Was Reincarnation Tea made from the leaves of the Reincarnation Tree?

“Hehe, this small pouch holds a seed of the Reincarnation Tree,” the elder said with a chuckle.

Excitement spread throughout the arena, and many people instantly stood up in fervor.

One had to realize that the accumulation of Origin Power required time. For example, one would gain 100,000 years of life expectancy with each minor level they advanced in the Mountain River Tier. However, it would only take a maximum of 10,000 years to accumulate one’s Origin Power to the peak limit.

What was hard was comprehending one’s cultivation level and strengthening one’s divine sense.

However, if they could cultivate under the Reincarnation Tree, a fraction of a second would be equivalent to one lifetime! Would one still need to worry about being unable to comprehend their cultivation level? Would one still need to worry about being unable to strengthen their divine sense?

‘It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine!’

This was the only thought running through everyone’s mind at this moment.

“Hehe.” The elder chuckled, and said, “I need to make something clear first. Although this seed has already been appraised and confirmed as the Reincarnation Tree, legends say that this tree doesn’t belong to this world. No one knows how to grow it.

“Moreover, according to ancient records, the Reincarnation Tree needs 12 trillion years to grow. It’s because of this extraordinary growth time that it can allow one’s soul to experience a lifetime in just a fraction of a second.”

Pu!

Everyone felt like spitting blood. Whether or not the tree could germinate was already a problem. Yet, even if it did germinate, it would still need another 12 trillion years to grow. Who could wait for that long?

One had to realize that the lifespan of a cultivator at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier was only 40,000,000 years. This was a long way off from 100,000,000 years, let alone 12 trillion years.

People often said that later generations enjoyed the shade cast by trees planted by the earlier generation. However, who would be able to enjoy the benefits provided by this tree? Perhaps one’s clan or force would have already disappeared by the time the Reincarnation Tree became mature.

This was 12 trillion years, not 1.2 billion years. Who could guarantee that their clan would prosper for such a long time?

A large majority of people lost interest upon learning of this.

“The starting bid is 1,000,000 True Origin Stones. Each increment has to be at least 10,000 True Origin Stones.” The elder sighed as he announced the starting price. He knew that the price of the Reincarnation Tree would definitely fall dramatically after he revealed its lengthy growth time. However, the auction industry had its own set of rules and regulations, and if they lost credibility, how would they continue to do business in the future?

“1.01 million.”

“1.02 million.”

There were still some bidders. After all, this was a genuine Godly Tree, and if they resold it to someone else, there was a possibility that they could make a huge profit.

“Purchase this tree!” the Small Tower suddenly said.

“It needs 12 trillion years to grow... Do you think I can live so long?” Ling Han asked in his mind.
