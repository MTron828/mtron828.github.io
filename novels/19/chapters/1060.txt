Chapter 1061: Sacrificial Altar

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Asura Demon Emperor felt a bit similar to this murderous aura.

Neither of them had a physical form, and both of them existed in more of a spiritual sense. Back then, the Asura Demon Emperor had survived being sliced into eight separate pieces—this would have been impossible if it were another being, even if they were far stronger than the Asura Demon Emperor.

However, the Asura Demon Emperor was most afraid of spiritual attacks. As long as his opponent had a stronger divine sense than him, they would be able to severely wound him through spiritual secret techniques.

This murderous aura was such kind of opponent, with its attacks targeting one’s divine sense.

The Asura Demon Emperor started gagging, yet he was still in his mist-like form, so how could he vomit anything out? After gagging for a while, he returned into the puppet wolf’s body, and said, “Master, this aura is quite hard to deal with.”

“You need to temper your divine sense more,” Ling Han said.

Saying this was easy, yet there were very few cultivation techniques that could temper one’s divine sense. Moreover, these rare few cultivation techniques were generally owned by Demon Masters. Ordinary cultivators could only strengthen their divine sense as increasing its toughness was far, far too difficult.

This was similar to how cultivating one’s body was easy. Body Arts weren’t easily accessible, yet there were still numerous avenues to get ahold of them. However, what about cultivation techniques that could strengthen one’s physique? They were incredibly rare!

Of course, the Asura Demon Emperor didn’t dare say this, and could only grumble in his mind. However, he was especially curious. Not only did his master possess a powerful physique, but he even possessed a tremendously tough divine sense. Was he trying to defy the heavens? What kind of secret technique did he cultivate?

The human and wolf continued to advance forward. The murderous aura here all treated a certain region as the core, and would continuously gather until it reached a certain threshold, after which it would form a humanoid figure.

It wasn’t long before another humanoid figure appeared and charged toward Ling Han.

It gave a piercing cry that was silent yet directly entered one’s mind and triggered tumultuous waves.

“Battle of divine senses? Who’s scared of whom?” Ling Han unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique toward the humanoid aura.

Pu!

The humanoid aura was instantly blasted into smithereens. Its obliterated parts still wanted to gather, yet were unable to do so no matter what as if they had lost their adhesiveness.

Sure enough, the weak point of this murderous aura was its divine sense, which was also its strong point. As long as one had a stronger divine sense, they would be able to easily defeat this murderous aura.

Ling Han waved his hand, causing the fragments of murderous aura to shatter into countless pieces that scattered into the surroundings.

“Master, your might is truly brilliant! You’re definitely the strongest prodigy in all of heaven and earth and in the past epoch and the future epoch! Not one of the strongest, but the strongest!” The Asura Demon Emperor heaped praise on Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Since I’m so great, you, my underling, can’t be too weak, either. I’ll hand the remaining opponents to you.”

“Fine— not fine!” The Asura Demon Emperor was just about to pat his chest and agree, yet he instantly dropped his tail in fright when he cast his eyes ahead. This was because an even larger murderous humanoid aura had appeared ahead.

They had already defeated a few humanoid aura figures, and they knew that the larger their bodies, the more murderous aura they possessed. At the same time, it also meant that they were stronger.

As for the one before them right now... If it roared, the Asura Demon Emperor wouldn’t simply be jolted out of the puppet body. Instead, his entire body would shatter into pieces. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although his existence was peculiar—it wouldn’t matter even if he was shattered into pieces—who would want to be blasted into bits for no good reason? It hurt like hell, okay?!

“Master, save me!” the Asura Demon Emperor cried pitifully.

Although he had the body of the puppet wolf, and had a battle prowess at the late stage of the consummate level, it was as if the murderous humanoid aura figures were his nemesis. They specialized in divine sense attacks and completely mitigated his advantage of having a powerful physique.

Ling Han tried to absorb the murderous aura into his Black Tower, yet they possessed a martial intent even though they weren’t genuine living beings. They were like God Tools, and it was therefore necessary to erase their martial intent before they could be absorbed.

However, without the support of martial intent, the murderous aura here would also completely vanish.

Thus, the Black Tower couldn’t provide him any help.

Ling Han unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique, instantly causing the head of the humanoid aura figure to explode. However, the other parts of the humanoid aura remained unscathed.

A harrowing sight played out before them. The humanoid aura plucked its own head off before sending a surge of murderous aura toward its neck and growing another head.

The humanoid aura didn’t have a set form to begin with, and it could reassemble itself even if it was hacked into dozens of pieces. As such, it was naturally easy for it to regrow its own head.

“This one is slightly stronger.” Ling Han attacked again, activating his divine patterns of flame as he unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique. Both of these techniques were extremely effective against the humanoid aura figures.

The humanoid aura didn’t yield, instead launching into a ferocious battle against Ling Han. Spiritual attacks that caused incredibly uncomfortable piercing pain were contained in all of its attacks.

It took Ling Han quite some time and effort to finally dispose of this humanoid aura figure. The process had been straining, and it was as if he had fought an intense battle against a powerful enemy.

“Master is so amazing! Master is so great!” The Asura Demon Emperor instantly started to flatter Ling Han again.

They continued to advance, and after dealing with a few more humanoid aura figures, a gigantic humanoid aura figure that measured nine meters in height suddenly appeared before them.

Even Ling Han furrowed his brows in apprehension, let alone the Asura Demon Emperor, whose eyes were already popping out of his head in fright.

There was far too much murderous aura gathered here!

“Rargh!!” A spiritual attack surged over as the gigantic humanoid aura slammed its palm on them. More surprisingly, this spiritual attack transformed into a tangible wave that even caused the ground to rumble and tremor.

Ling Han instantly pushed any thoughts of battle out of his mind.

Shua!

He immediately grabbed the tail of the puppet wolf and entered the Black Tower along with the Asura Demon Emperor.

Boom!

Dust billowed through the air as the palm of the giant humanoid aura struck into the ground. However, it was a little baffled. Where were its opponents?

The Black Tower was pushed along by the shock wave, drifting into the distance along with the other particles of dust.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower and immediately started to flee.

There was absolutely no point in battling the humanoid aura here. If he battled against Demonic Beasts, he could at least hope to obtain some nutritional Spiritual Meat. As for humanoid aura figures? He would receive sh*tl!

That being the case, what was the point in battling against them?

Ling Han frenziedly ran away, evading the humanoid aura figures if he could. If he couldn’t avoid them, he would hack them aside with his sword and then seize the opportunity while they regathered themselves to flee.

However, the murderous aura grew stronger the deeper he ventured into the crimson land. As he continued to advance, even humanoid aura figures that measured 30 meters tall were not an uncommon sight. Even Ling Han lacked the confidence to battle against them, and he would skirt far, far away whenever he caught sight of one.

The spiritual attacks of such humanoid aura figures were on par with those of elites at the Sun Moon Tier, so even Ling Han was no match for them.

A mountain appeared before him.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han immediately shook his head. That was no mountain. Instead, it was a sacrificial altar! However, it looked like a mountain at first glance because of its enormous size.

This sacrificial altar was genuinely massive, measuring a full 3000 meters in height. Its body was in the shape of a triangular pyramid, and it was built from stone slabs that were all bigger than houses. It was entirely red, and under the dim glow of night, it looked much like a sleeping beast.

Why did Ling Han think that this was a sacrificial altar?

This was because a sanguinary smell of blood flooded into his nostrils. Such a pungent smell was definitely the result of at least several million beings being killed, not just a few thousand or several tens of thousands. In fact, the stone slabs of this sacrificial altar hadn’t been red to begin with, but had been dyed red from the blood that flowed down its surface.

Mountains of corpses were still piled next to the altar, and although they weren’t piled as tall as the altar, they covered an area of several hundred kilometers wide. After seeing this, the figure of several million was truly a severe underestimation. At least ten times that number of beings had been killed here.

What on earth was the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire scheming?
