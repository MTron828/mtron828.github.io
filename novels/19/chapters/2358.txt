Chapter 2359: Area of madness

Ling Han was stunned. The so-called Source Power of heaven and earth was actually Chaos Source Rock!

No wonder Small Tower had previously said that the Chaos Source Rock could help it recover slightly. This was a treasure close to Celestial King Tier… no, Celestial Kings were also using Source Power, which was only a level higher than Regulations.

This was a Celestial-King-Tier resource, and it could be said that Celestial Kings were using Chaos Source?Rocks1.

However, though this Chaos Source Rock in front of him was massive, the essence contained within was actually not much. To speak more crudely, it contained too many impurities.

“Even a little bit is still good.” Ling Han swept out with a palm strike, wanting to extinguish the flames on the rock, yet shockingly discovered that the flames merely flickered when his palm landed. He actually had not managed to extinguish the flames.

“Interesting!” he commented, smiling.

“Let Niu do it!” Hu Niu was full of zest, and also waved out her small hand to extinguish the fire, but the flames merely waved, and were completely unmoved.

“Hu! Hu!” The little girl then simply chose to puff up her cheeks and blow out, which caused Ling Han, the Empress, and Bewitching Maiden Rou to break into laughter. Even Little Terror was baring its teeth, releasing a wolf-like howl.

“You are no wolf, so why are you howling like one?” Hu Niu placed her hands on her hips, fuming.

Little Terror expressed that it was very innocent. From birth, that was the way it called out.

Ling Han channeled the power of Regulation, and pressed his hand down once more on the burning rock. An endless chill spread out, turning into layers of ice which wrapped around the rock.

The flames were immediately controlled, but they were still flickering stubbornly, seeming like they were unwilling to go out no matter what.

Ling Han increased the intensity of the power of Regulation, and the flames were further repressed, but still were not extinguished.

“The Source Power of heaven and earth is indeed extraordinary.”

Ling Han nodded internally. No wonder this would be effective for the recovery of the Black Tower. It was indeed extraordinary.

However, Small Tower has also said before that a Chaos Source Rock could only help it recover by a ten-thousandth, which was still endlessly far from the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

The Source Power of heaven and earth should be set between Regulations and the essence of a Genesis World, the transition between the Celestial King Tier and Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Ling Han continuously used his power to suppress it. Various Regulations appeared one after another, and only then did he finally suppress the flames.

He casually tossed the Chaos Source Rock over to Bewitching Maiden Rou, and said, “For you.”

“Me?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked in surprise as she pointed at herself, appearing like she could not fathom this at all.

At present, everyone needed Chaos Source Rocks, and, logically speaking, the priority of Ling Han, Hu Niu, and the Empress should be higher than her.

Ling Han smiled. “You have to quickly complete the tempering of the Immortal Palace Tier, and we still have some slight room for improvement, so you can use it first.”

Both the Empress and Hu Niu nodded. They were not petty people, what more when Ling Han’s words were reasonable.

Bewitching Maiden Rou was touched. Though Ling Han had spoken the truth, Chaos Source Rocks would not expire even if they were not used, so how could it be that it could not be stored inside the Black Tower? She did not say anything further, and merely put away the Chaos Source Rock.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Your strength is indeed a weakness among us. You will only be a burden unless you advance into the Ascending Origin Tier.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When these words fell, Bewitching Maiden Rou was instantly outraged. ‘Does this guy really not know how to speak sweet words in the slightest? Will you die if you comfort me a bit?’

“I am going into the Black Tower to cultivate!” she snapped. If she had enough strength, she would definitely beat Ling Han up.

Ling Han laughed, and drew Bewitching Maiden Rou into the Black Tower.

They continued onwards. The volcano was constantly erupting, and because the direction of lava flow was indefinite, there was no way to trace its whereabouts. Hence, they could only collect the Chaos Source Rocks that had been scattered in the area.

This time, their luck was not that good, as they had not found any even after half a day.

Initially, the mountain was green and grassy, but with the volcano wreaking havoc, there were holes and depressions everywhere. Some places were even filled with fiery flames, but ordinary fire could not last for too long, either. The plants here all had astonishing vitality, and the flames soon went out by themselves.

“Do not underestimate this place.” Ling Han flipped through the information that Liao Kong had given them before. It contained a detailed introduction of Golden Clouds Mountain.

The outer circle here was very safe, but when one entered into the inner circle, it would become dangerous.

That was because Golden Clouds Mountain by itself was already very amazing, and had a strange effect on living beings. If one stayed for a long time here, his cultivation level would advance astonishingly quickly, but the side effect would be that his spiritual state would become extremely violent, and only the primitive instincts of slaughter would be left in the end.

The native wild beasts here were all violent killing machines, and some cultivators who risked coming here tried to quickly grow, yet they were all swallowed by their own greed, and ultimately also became wild beasts in human form.

Though the eruptions of the volcano had no pattern, the majority of substances erupted would be falling inside the inner circle. Hence, if they wanted to increase their harvest, they would have to enter deeply into Golden Clouds Mountain’s premises.

“Let’s climb the mountain,” the Empress said.

Hu Niu’s expression was filled with excitement. “Climb the mountain to hunt us some food!”

Ling Han nodded. Though this mountain was very bizarre, being capable of influencing the spiritual state, they were merely planning to stay here for around one or two months. This could not possibly turn them into wild beasts.

They climbed the mountain, and there were increasingly less people around them. This was because everyone knew that there were mad wild beasts which would battle to death even if they were outmatched on the mountain, and if they encountered powerful beasts… It was definite that death would be the only outcome.

Begging to be spared was useless. These wild beasts, or even wild men, only had the sole thought of slaughter, and even the disciples and descendants of Heavenly Venerates were worthless in their eyes.

It was not just them. Even the wild beasts and wild men of the mountain were very interested in these Chaos Source Rocks. As long as they were at the Ninth Lotus or had reached the peak stage of the Eighth Lotus, Chaos Source Rocks would be beneficial for them, and desire for strength was their second instinct aside from desire to slaughter.

Ling Han and the others soon encountered one such mad wild beast. It was a palm civet, but it was as long as nine meters, with wings sprouting from its back. However, it was no longer snow-white or golden like Holy Beasts, but rather dark gray in color. Furthermore, it was battered and tattered, looking incredibly ugly.

The moment this wild beast appeared, it pounced, releasing a mad barrage of bites, but in truth, it only had merely Eighth Lotus Fourth Leaf’s battle prowess, and Ling Han defeated it just by stretching out a hand.

Hu Niu immediately took out the barbeque grill while banging a knife as she cheered, “Meat! Meat! Meat!”

Ling Han waved a hand. He was very interested in the reason why these wild beasts had gone mad.

Theoretically, the Regulation of Darkness also had this effect, being capable of driving others into madness, but Ling Han had not sensed any strong Regulation of Darkness in this place. If it was said that this was the main reason for their madness, he would refuse to believe it.

He examined closely, and discovered that there was a grayish layer contained in the head of this wild beast, but he was completely unable to discern what exactly this was.

Xiu, a streak of green light suddenly shot over. As it turned out, Wally had taken human form, and was presently scanning it with his eyes.

“A substance that has never been seen before,” Wally soon declared.

“Aren’t you afraid that you would be discovered by a Heavenly Venerate by suddenly appearing like this?” Ling Han asked.

“They won’t.” Wally appeared very confident in himself. “Firstly, I have activated my concealment skill, and secondly, those two beings with Vitality Index over 15,000 points are only a form of spiritual wave. The chance of me being discovered is zero.”

Ling Han knew that this guy spoke in probability and odds. Since he had appeared, it was definitely fine. Ling Han had only been joking.

“Even you don’t know what this is?” Ling Han asked.
