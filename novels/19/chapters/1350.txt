Chapter 1351 Highest Jade Essence Hear

Zhao Ku didn’t dare to make a peep as he hurriedly left with his 12 beauties and warriors. As for whether or not he hated Ling Han and wanted to take revenge for this, only he himself would know.

The remaining members of the Earth Dragon Sect all felt pure despair. Even Zhao Ku had fled with his tail between his legs!

To say nothing of the terrifying Ling Han, even if he patted his hands and left, would Zhao Ku forgive them for this?

“You’ve inflicted this fate upon yourselves!” Ling Han was merciless as he massacred them.

Feng Po Yun, Ding Ping, and the others all joined in on the massacre of the Earth Dragon Sect.

However, they weren’t depraved and bloodthirsty people, after all, so they stopped after killing everyone who was culpable. As for the remaining people, they crippled their cultivation before letting them go. They were free to live out the remainder of their short lives.

Ling Han and the others all felt solemn after this massacre. None of them felt the joy or delight of exacting revenge.

However, the Five Sects had finally been relegated to the annals of history. They had finally cut this ribbon of fate, and there would be no more lingering thoughts of the Five Sects in the future.

Ling Han collected his spoils of battle.

However, the warship was far too large, and even he couldn’t wrap his divine sense around its entire body and bring it into the Black Tower. Moreover, its huge size meant that it couldn’t be landed in most places. In other words, this warship could only stay in the air and continue to consume exorbitant amounts of True Origin Stones.

Ling Han wasn’t profligate enough to waste his resources on such a luxurious yet useless warship.

He started a huge demolition job, ripping all kinds of valuable items off the gigantic warship—for example, he took Godly metal and True Origin Stones. The Godly metal was obviously for his Divine Demon Sword to consume, while the True Origin Stones were essentially money.

He also collected all kinds of other materials. He could sell these in the future.

After ripping off the final formation, the gigantic warship naturally lost its ability to fly. It crashed down from the sky. However, Ling Han had already flown the warship to an uninhabited place deep in the marshlands before his huge demolition job. Thus, the warship naturally wouldn’t cause too much damage when it eventually crashed down.

However, the huge impact of the crash still triggered an earthquake that affected some of the surrounding areas.

Fortunately, this was the Immortal Realm, where the foundation of the land was incredibly stable. Otherwise, the destruction caused by the crash would have definitely been 10,0000 times more severe.

Ling Han came out of this battle with a rich supply of loot. Although he had plundered Zhao Ku, he had essentially been plundering the wealth of an Eternal River Tier. Thus, his yield was naturally astonishingly bountiful.

After devouring the large amount of Godly metal that he had obtained, the quality of Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword successfully advanced to level nine. Moreover, after the shrinkage from before, it was now gradually starting to grow back in size. Although it still hadn’t returned to its original size yet, it had already reached a length of around two feet. Ling Han was extremely satisfied with this.

They left the Earth Dragon Sect and headed toward the nearest city. Ling Han still needed to sell the huge amounts of materials that he had ripped out from the gigantic warship.

This would earn him a huge sum of money. Perhaps he would even be able to purchase enough Level Nine Godly metal to raise the quality of his Divine Demon Sword to level 10. If that were to happen, the Divine Demon Sword’s cultivation level would surpass Ling Han’s.

They arrived at Gathering Wind City. This was a huge city, and there were even Heavenly Body Tier elites overlooking it. Cultivation and business were both booming in this city.

Since they wanted to sell things, they naturally had to look for the Gold Origin Auction House. Ling Han handed this task to his disciples. There was no need for him to personally attend to everything.

After a few hours, his five disciples returned. They had already handed the materials to the auction house. Moreover, they also brought with them some unexpected news—the Gold Origin Auction House was going to hold a large auction soon, and one of the items would be... the Highest Jade Essence Heart!

Highest Jade Essence Heart—this was what Old Man Xu had asked Ling Han to search for. The old man hadn’t told him why, but he had asked Ling Han to obtain it at all costs and bring it back to him if he were to ever come across it.

Ling Han had never forgotten this request. In fact, he had even asked his three brothers and five disciples to keep this request in mind. Who would have thought that they would come across the Highest Jade Essence Heart here?

“Master, what’s the use of this thing?” Ding Ping asked.

Ling Han shrugged, and replied, “I don’t know, either.”

His five disciples all felt confused. Why was their master looking for this item if he didn’t know its uses?

Ling Han laughed, and said, “I’m sure we’ll find out about its uses if we ask around.”

‘These five disciples... Jeez, since they know that there’s a Highest Jade Essence Heart for sale, why didn’t they ask about its uses?’

If Ding Ping and the others could read Lin Han’s thoughts, they would definitely feel extremely hard done by. They thought that Ling Han already knew about its uses! After all, it was his instruction for them to keep an eye out for it. After they learned of its auction, they had hurriedly run back to tell him about it.

Ling Han wandered around to gather some information about the Highest Jade Essence Heart.

In the end, he learned that this item had two uses. First, it could be used to suppress and dissolve fire poison. Second, it could be used to save one’s life. This was a Godly medicine that was nurtured by heaven and earth, so it was even more effective than many other Divine Pills.

However, this also meant that the Highest Jade Essence Heart was incredibly valuable. As such, it would naturally attract attention and bids from many people. After all, life-saving treasures were the most valuable things. Moreover, with this item in hand, one could also increase their chances of finding treasures in ancient sites that were covered in intense flames. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh. He was always faced with the same problem.

He didn’t have enough money!

Although he could make a huge sum of money from the materials that he had handed the auction house, who knew whether this would be enough to win the bid for the Highest Jade Essence Heart? In any case, he still wanted to purchase some more Godly metal.

‘How can I make more money?’

“Master, there’s a tournament ground in this city, and one can place bets there. For each battle that you win, you can double the value of your bet. If you win 10 battles in a row, you can receive 1000 times the value of your bet! However, if you lose even a single battle, you won’t make a single cent at all,” Jiang Yuefeng said.

“Oh?” Ling Han’s eyes instantly lit up, and he asked, “Is it fair?”

If one won nine battles in a row, yet the tournament ground owner dispatched a cultivator one major tier above to them in the 10th battle, how could one ever achieve 10 victories in a row?

“Participants will only come across opponents at the same cultivation level,” Jiang Yuefeng replied. “However, Master, you can’t participate in this tournament ground.”

“Why not?”

“Because there’s a rule stating that only those below the Heavenly Body Tier can participate,” Jiang Yuefeng said with a chuckle.

Ling Han was speechless. However, the existence of such a rule made a lot of sense.

Although this city was overlooked by Heavenly Body Tier elites, this also signified that Heavenly Body Tier elites were the strongest beings in this place. They were like the kings of this city, so how could they stoop as low as participating in a tourney?

“Go, everyone participate in the tournament ground to win me some money!” Ling Han could only pin his hopes on the others.

Ding Ping patted his chest, and said, “Leave it to me! I definitely won’t disappoint you, Master!”

“No, leave it to me!” Chen Ruijing hurriedly said.

Ling Han’s disciples scrambled to help him solve his money problem.

Feng Po Yun walked over, and said, “Haha, Fourth Brother, Mu Rong Qing and I also want to give this tournament a go.”

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Among us, Ding Ping has the greatest chance of winning 10 battles in a row. After all, he’s already reached the middle stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. He should be invincible among cultivators at the same cultivation level.”

Everyone nodded in agreement. People would only come across opponents at the same cultivation level in battle, though the definition of “same cultivation level” encapsulated everyone from the early stage to the consummate level. In other words, there could be a power difference of three or even four stars. To most cultivators, reaching four stars was already the limit. Thus, someone at the early stage of a tier would definitely be at a huge disadvantage if they were to come across someone at the consummate level of the tier.

That being the case, it was natural that people would only participate in the tournament ground battles when they reached the consummate level of their tier. This way, they could at least guarantee that they wouldn’t be at a disadvantage in terms of cultivation level.

However, how many people in the world could reach the pinnacle level?

Extremely few! Those who could reach the pinnacle level were genuine king tiers!

“Then we’ll let Ding Ping battle first. He can win us 1000 times our bet!” Ling Han came to a decision, and he handed all of his True Origin Stones to Ding Ping.

Ding Ping patted his chest, and said, “Master, leave it to me!”
