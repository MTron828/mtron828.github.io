Chapter 1052: The Empress Speaks

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The battle thus ended.

In the Iron Blood Stadium, there was complete silence. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was too inconceivable. This sudden turn of events was really too dramatic, and happened too quickly!

Wu Ziren was someone that possessed battle prowess on the level of pseudo-Sun Moon Tier. Even if an elite in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier stepped up, he would still have to exert a little effort to suppress Wu Ziren.

But Ling Han?

His cultivation level was definitely in the late stage of the medium extreme. He had not burst out with enough power to produce a shock just now; he had merely blocked Wu Ziren’s fatal strike with a very strange method. He had also struck with his sword at an inconceivably fast speed, and ended the battle.

Strange, this was too strange.

An elite at pseudo-Sun Moon Tier was actually killed so simply?

Everyone was tweaking their ears and scratching their cheeks in frustration. No matter what, they could not accept this conclusion. They had obviously seen it with their own eyes, but none of them could accept this fact, because this far exceeded common sense.

Perhaps there really was a 10-star genius in this world, but the battle prowess that Ling Han had shown previously had definitely not reached that level!

Strange! This was too strange!

“The brick in that brat’s hand!” Finally, someone spotted this clue. Otherwise, in that kind of dangerous situation, what reason would Ling Han have for taking out a brick? But what kind of brick was that? It obviously did not have any divine patterns flickering on it, so it should not be a God Tool, yet it was capable of dispersing the attack of a pseudo-Sun Moon Tier opponent.

“Hahahaha, the damn blockhead has indeed won!” Li Weiwei laughed, clapping her hands.

Sha Yuan was also extremely shocked, and exclaimed, “This is too inconceivable. He could still win in this kind of situation? Strange, strange, this is much too strange!”

Meanwhile, Zhao Lun looked like he had been struck dumb.

For the sake of this battle, he had spent a whole 400,000 True Origin Stones. Just now, he had boasted wildly, yet now reality gave him a heavy slap.

Not only had Ling Han not died, he had turned the battle around and killed Wu Ziren!

He lost his man, his face, and also his money!

“Zhao Lun, what were you saying just now?” Li Weiwei giggled. She had never been a benevolent one. Since she now had the upper hand, she was naturally going to press her advantage.

Zhao Lun’s face was ashen. Although he was the son of a Great General, 400,000 True Origin Stones was definitely not a paltry sum, and caused him great heartache. Now, being mocked by Li Weiwei in this manner, it could be imagined how horrible a mood he was in.

“We’re leaving!” He felt shamed, and directly left with a flutter of his robes.

Yang Luodan quickly followed suit, inwardly anxious. Zhao Lun was not in a good mood right now, so when they returned, he would definitely vent it on her. Who knew how much she would be tortured this time.

‘This brat must definitely be gotten rid of as soon as possible!’ Sha Yuan stared at Ling Han, who was standing in the stadium. His eyes were flickering with killing intent. ‘And that stone slab. Exactly what kind of treasure is it that it can actually disperse the attack from a pseudo-Sun Moon Tier foe? After this lowly commoner is killed, aside from taking his cultivation technique, we cannot miss this stone slab, either.’

Only at this moment did the people in the Iron Blood Stadium finally release the restrictions, and were able to enter into the stadium.

Xiu , a female guard flew in, and stood at the top of the high flagpole in the Iron Blood Stadium, conveying an imperial decree in a dignified manner. “By Her Imperial Majesty’s command, Ling Han is summoned!”

“We shall obey your imperial decree!” everyone quickly exclaimed, appearing to be incredibly reverent and fearful.

Oh no, even the empress had been disturbed. Now, no matter what secrets Ling Han had, it was of no relation to any of them.

Who would dare compete with the empress?

Ling Han shook his head internally. In that situation, he only had two options. Firstly, he could hide into the Black Tower, and secondly, he could use the Absolute Beginning Stone to excuse himself. Although he did not want to reveal the Absolute Beginning Stone, in comparison, the importance of the Black Tower far exceeded the former’s.

Thus, he chose to use the Absolute Beginning Stone.

This time, it was not the Ninth King conveying a false imperial decree. Ling Han followed that female guard into the Imperial Palace. After passing through multiple layers of defense, they finally arrived at the imperial garden.

“Your Imperial Majesty, Ling Han has been brought!” The female guard half-knelt to pay her respects.

Empress Luan Xing had her back to them, her beautiful figure wrapped in a bright red cloak. Only her beautiful cloud-like hair was visible, draping over her shoulders, slightly showing her slender nape and a little of her earlobe. Yet, she was filled with an enchanting grace that could make anyone’s spirit and heart drunk.

Formidable and imperious, but also filled with grace and tenderness. Merely her rear view was enough to perfectly meld these two opposing sides perfectly. She was probably the only one in the world who could accomplish this.

Slight confusion once again rose up in Ling Han’s heart. The charm of this empress was really too much. Though he had tried his best to suppress the memory of her figure at the bottom of his heart, it was immediately incited once more with him seeing her now. Furthermore, the memory was 10 times stronger than before.

After staying with her for a while longer, was there really any man in this world that could resist her charms?

“That stone slab, let me see it!” Empress Luan Xing said. She was not at all reserved with Ling Han, and directly spoke up.

She was the ruler of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, and could give and take as she desired.

Ling Han knew that he could not possibly resist. Hence, he took out the Absolute Beginning Stone, and said, “This is something I obtained not too long ago when I was travelling outside. It can absorb all attacks.”

The female guard by his side received the stone slab from him, and took small, quick steps to Empress Luan Xing. She half-knelt, while her hands held up the Absolute Beginning Stone.

Empress Luan Xing received it, and directly held her index and middle fingers together to draw a line over it.

“En?” She released a surprised exclamation. Although she had not used too much power in her fingers, the attack was completely absorbed. This had far, far exceeded her imagination. She began to gather power, wanting to release a stronger power to test out the limits of this stone slab.

Suddenly, their surroundings darkened. Only Empress Luan Xing stood proudly, releasing an overbearing presence that proclaimed her sole supremacy in this land.

Too strong, she was really too strong!

Ling Han did not doubt in the least that if Empress Luan Xing wanted to kill him, he would not even have the chance to duck into the Black Tower.

The gap between every cultivation tier in the Immortal level was really too wide. To the present him, the Heavenly Body Tier was so far that it seemed like the horizon.

However, even after she had gathered power for such an attack, it still did not produce the slightest effect when the attack landed on the Absolute Beginning Stone. There wasn’t even the smallest ripple.

Ling Han thought, ‘This is the Absolute Beginning Stone. Only power of the Genesis Tier can damage it. Heavenly Body Tier would really not have much use against it.’

“Ling Han...” Empress Luan Xing began, yet she paused slightly.

Ling Han knew her intention. He did not have a choice, so he could only say, “I was just thinking to gift this amazing stone to you, Your Imperial Majesty. Please allow me to do so, Your Imperial Majesty.”

Humph, just treat it like a betrothal gift. When they got married in future, they would have ‘fun’ every day in return!

This thought passed in his mind, and Ling Han couldn’t help but feel stunned. Unconsciously, he had again been captivated by the charm of this Empress Luan Xing. Subconsciously, he had thought of taking her as one of his wives, but in truth, he had not even seen the real face of Empress Luan Xing.

This was too scary. How could there be such a seductive beauty? Shui Yanyu appeared to be graceful and elegant, but compared to her, they were completely of two different worlds.

Empress Luan Xing was very pleased. She was an overlord of this era, so how could she possibly open her mouth to ask for something from her subject? After some thought, she said, “Your cultivation level has progressed rapidly. In the future, you could become a pillar of support for our Empire, so I shall bestow on you the title of a ninth-rank military officer. You’ll also receive a salary from the empire!”

Weng!

Above the Imperial Capital, a change immediately took place on that totem, releasing a pillar of light that show towards Ling Han. Moreover, Ling Han’s name was added to the totem, releasing a brilliant light.

Was this compensation?

Ling Han sighed internally. There was nothing to be done. Since the empress had that intention, he could not refuse. However, it was not bad that he got an official rank out of the deal. From this moment on, he could draw on power of the nation to cultivate and boost his battle prowess. More importantly, now that he had an official rank, he was no longer a hostage!

It meant that he was finally a free man!
