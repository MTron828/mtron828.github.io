Chapter 3610: You are not worthy of watching the battle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the Cold Water Lake, on top of this ice island, two elites were fighting? These two people were both very young. One was dressed in green robes, while the other was dressed in purple robes. Both of them were very young, but standing there, they had an intimidating bearing.

“Qian Senlai, you were no match for me when you were a Human Dao Foundation, you were no match for me when you were a Heavenly Dao Foundation, and now that er’ve returned to the mortal level, you’re still no match for me,” the young man in green said proudly.

There was a sword in his hand, and it shone with brilliant light, exuding a fierce and cold aura.

The purple-robed young man who had been referred to as Qian Senlai snorted, “Luo Xi, is the reason why my ranking is lower than yours because my battle prowess is lower than yours? It is just that you are very lucky, and that is why you are ranked one place higher than me every time.”

The young man in green, Luo Xi, shook his head, “Keep being stubborn, and see how I will teach you how to behave!”

-Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Qian Senlai was completely unafraid. “However, before that, we have to chase off a fly!” Luo Xi looked towards Ling Han. Previously, neither of them had cast a second look at Ling Han, but that did not mean that they had not discovered Ling Han.

—Tang Yun’er had already entered into the gourd. Though her Spiritual Power far surpassed her peers, it was obviously incomparable to Ling Han. She had long since been unable to hold on.

Meanwhile, Qian Senlai had already strode over to Ling Han. He held a black saber in his hand, which was covered with veined patterns, exuding a monstrous might, “Get lost. You are not qualified to observe our battle!” initially, Ling Han had only planned to leave after he landed on the ice island and recovered his Spiritual Power In any case, there were no Water Element creatures here, but the prerequisite was that he had willingly left.

You want to chase me away?

What right did he have!

“Was this island of ice built by your family?” Ling Han asked.

Qian Senlai faltered for a moment. Of course, that was impossible. This was naturally formed, but don’t you know who I, Qian Senlai, am? To actually dare to speak insolently to me?

“Even if it was built by your family, does this Cold Water Lake belong to your family? Building illegal structures in a public place, you should be fined!” Ling Han blurted out.

Qian Senlai was a little dumbfounded. What was going on here?

-Hahahaha!” Meanwhile, Luo Xi laughed loudly. Because of his ranking, he and Qian Senlai had already been enemies for a very long time. Now that he saw this old rival being duped into a daze, he was greatly pleased.

Qian Senlai’s expression darkened, and he said, “Are you determined to suffer a little?”

He strode over, dragging the blade of his saber on the ice island. Crackle!

Sparks flew into the air.

In truth, this Island of Ice was incredibly sturdy, and was completely capable of sustaining normal Mystery Realm Tiers battling on it. Yet now, the two of them had actually sliced off the top, so their strength was indeed terrifying.

This naturally was because they had used high-level energy. Otherwise, in terms of pure brute force, Mystery Realm Tiers were really not qualified to cause damage to this kind of ice mountain.

Ling Han crossed his arms over his chest, and knew, “What is it? Want to fight?”

“Are you even qualified?” Qian Senlai said with a cold chuckle. He was the ninth-ranked prodigy of the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, there were at most five prodigies who were more powerful than him, or even fewer.

—This kind of ranking naturally would not be strictly calculated based on battle prowess in a battle of equal cultivation levels, so he was sure that his true battle prowess was definitely not just ranked ninth.

Even if he was only ranked ninth, that was not something that this unfamiliar young man in front of him could compare to. The gap was too wide.

Ling Han stretched his neck and arms and legs, and broke into a grin, ”1 just happen to be a little bored in the water, so I’ll use you to relieve my boredom.” Qian Senlai raised his thick brows. Did this guy really want to die? He actually dared to provoke him like this?

That’s right, this person did not know who he was at all. No wonder he was bursting with confidence.

Hehe, then let him see what a top-grade prodigy was.

“Get down!” He moved, and stretched out his left hand. Boom, a frightening power surged out, pressing down on Ling Han.

Ling Han casually sent out a palm strike. Peng, Qian Senlai’s attack was dispersed.

“Yi?” “En?”

Qian Senlai and Luo Xi were both stunned. This scene had exceeded their expectations.

Even if Qian Senlai hadn’t used his full strength, Ling Han’s strength was already not to be underestimated.

“If you could also have that kind of strength in the Foundation Building Tier, you would be qualified to be ranked in the top hundred.” Qian Senlai judged, “Unfortunately, you are only a mere Mystery Realm Tier. With a leap from the Celestial Gate, you may be reduced to a mediocre character.

“Even a mediocre person can beat you to burst!” Ling Han counterattacked. He charged forwards, his fists moving continuously. Boom, boom, boom, the power of his fists surged out, incredibly domineering.

Qian Senlai showed a hint of seriousness. He did not use his saber, but rather put it away. Instead, he used his palms to deal with Ling Han.

What a joke. He was one of the few prodigies of Peaceful Splendor County. If he still needed to use a Spirit Tool to deal with a nameless nobody, would he still have any face?

They had only exchanged a few blows, and Qian Senlai immediately frowned. This opponent was unexpectedly strong.

Thankfully, his opponent did not seem to have cultivated Spiritual Power, and did not use any high-level energy. Though battle prowess was strong, his destructive power was only brute force. He could deal with it by dispelling his attacks.

This was natural. In the first place, Ling Han’s Spiritual Power had almost been used up before he had surfaced. Though he could still use it for a while, wasn’t there another person on the other side? He naturally had to keep some trump cards.

Good steel should be used on the cutting edge. If he used Spiritual Power, he would definitely communicate with the power of destruction, and directly kill these two people.

Even so, Ling Han still activated his Eye Technique, easily seeing through to all of Qian Senlai’s weak points. It wasn’t long before he gained the upper hand.

Yet Qian Senlai did not panic in the slightest. Instead, he laughed loudly, “Brat, I don’t know why you have such great power, but without cultivating Spiritual Power, your battle prowess has weakened by at least half!

“Hl let you see just how strong a Mystery Realm Tier can be! With a soft exclamation, his palms immediately became silvery white. This was also the Energy of Metal, and its level was extremely likely to be denser than the Metal Energy that Ling Han had stimulated. The way it was arranged was also different, and that was why it appeared silver in colour. Boom, he delivered a palm strike, and the silvery light was dazzling. Ling Han still greeted the incoming attack with his bare fists. Peng, the two of them exchanged a blow, and both took a few steps back.

Bloodstains appeared on Ling Han’s fist. The destructive power of high-level energy was too great, and the Spirit Diagram that Qian Senlai had mastered was extremely extraordinary, possessing even greater might. Thankfully, Ling Han’s bones had been tempered too hard, so it had only broken his skin. Looking at Qian Senlai again, he was not much better. The web between his thumb and forefinger had actually split open.

Why?

Ling Han used Frequency Attack. After all, now that you have used high-level energy, it can’t be that I would continue to maintain my original battle prowess, right?

“I have really underestimated you,” Qian Senlai said solemnly. He had really gone all out in that attack just now, but he had actually only managed to tie with Ling Han. The strength of his opponent was really extraordinary.

At least on the level of Mystery Realm Tier, the other already possessed the qualifications to stand against him.

The smile at the corners of Luo Xi’s lips also disappeared. He too felt the pressure.

If Ling Han could still maintain his standard when he leaped over the Celestial Gate, then this person would definitely become a powerful competitor for them.

Most importantly, what was it? The other party was already so powerful without even knowing how to communicate with high-level energy.. How amazing would it be if he learnt the amazing use of Spiritual Power?
