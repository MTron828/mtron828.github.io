2957 Shocking Change

Ling Han extended his senses, and an expression of disbelief immediately appeared on his face.

Thank you readers!

That was because… the majority of his life essence had flowed towards Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire, as if she was a bottomless abyss that could absorb and accommodate everything.

How could Ling Han not be stunned?

According to the deduction of the Seventh Tier ultimate elites, absorbing and refining life essence was Hysteria’s unique ability. This was because Hysteria had relied on this to start its conquest. It could even swallow dimensions and use them to strengthen itself.

Ling Han, Huangfu Dongyue, Meng Dong, and so on had all been bestowed with this ability by Hysteria. However, they could only absorb life essence, so there was a great limitation of their ability.

This was very normal. How could Hysteria possibly bestow any real trump card on them? Wouldn’t it be afraid of any accidents?

However, there was now another that was able to absorb life essence.

Was Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire one of Hysteria’s creations?

Was this possible?

The Heavenly Venerate Absolute Fire was a Seventh Tier; could Hysteria create a Seventh Tier ultimate elite?

Utterly impossible! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Hold on, what if this woman was like Meng Dong and the others, and was one of the living beings of the Genesis World who had had Hysteria’s spiritual mark attached to them? Then wouldn’t it be possible?

Of course, throughout history, there were only a total of 12 Seventh Tiers. If Hysteria just happened to choose one person, and that person became a Seventh Tier in the future, then the chances of this were pitifully low. It was like it had struck a great stroke of luck.

Becoming a Seventh Tier was very, very difficult!

However, why was Jue Huo able to absorb life essence? It was normal for her to be more powerful than Ling Han. She was a Seventh Tier, and her strength was superior to his, so she was naturally able to absorb more than he could.

“Yi?” Jue Huo also let out an exclamation of surprise. She was obviously unaware of this ability of hers. When the waves of life essence surged into her body, she felt a strangeness and novelty, as well as an indescribable fear.

In essence, she was still a child that had yet to reach one year old in age.

The six elites were enraged, and shouted at Ling Han, “Ling Han!”

For a Sixth Tier elite to die just like that, it was a great loss to the Flaming Frost Realm.

Ling Han came back to his senses, took out a Great Herb, and began to gnaw on it. This was the healing type of Great Herb, so it was naturally impossible for him to have eaten it before this. Now that he was gnawing on it like it was a carrot, the injuries on his body immediately began to recover.

“You have caused a great calamity!”

“No one can save you now!”

Ling Han’s expression was filled with disdain. “I’ve already killed him, so what’s the point of spouting such nonsense? Come, whoever is displeased and unconvinced, just bring it on. Just try and see whom I would fear?”

The six elites all glared at him, but did not speak.

They were naturally unafraid of Ling Han, but the problem was that there was still an ultimate Seventh-Tier elite on the sidelines. If she wanted to protect Ling Han, who would dare make a move?

When a Seventh Tier killed, there was no need for a reason. A single thought was more powerful than heaven and earth.

However, no one noticed that the eyes of Jue Huo, which were originally the pure eyes of an infant, had changed. A layer of dark red had appeared, and she had become incredibly demonic.

This dark red color became darker and darker, which also caused her aura to go out of control and blaze like fire.

“Ah…” She released a sharp cry, and shot straight up into the skies. Casually brandishing her fists and striking out with her legs, hong, hong, hong, the power of the Seventh Tier completely leaked out, forming a frightening destructive power.

Ling Han and the six elites all paled in shock. Jue Huo had clearly lost control of her emotions. In fact, she had even entered a state of madness.

A dignified Seventh Tier could actually go mad?

Ling Han also knew that Jue Huo had just absorbed a large amount of life essence from Yue Borong. Could it be that this was the cause? Otherwise, there was no other possibility.

The six great elites were all enraptured. For a Seventh Tier to go berserk… was too terrifying.

But when they looked at Ling Han again, their killing intent involuntarily blazed.

Now that Jue Huo had gone crazy, it was naturally impossible for her to protect Ling Han. Furthermore, Ling Han’s injuries had not recovered yet, and the explosive power of the Heavenly Venerable Seals had just passed, so it was precisely the moment when he was at his weakest.

If they worked together to attack him, they could very possibly kill Ling Han quickly.

…It was now or never!

Ling Han was too terrifying. His strength was improving every day, and if he was allowed to take another step further, he might be able to possess the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier. By then, would anyone be able to deal with him?

‘Die!’

The six elites communicated with each other through their divine sense, and moved together, attacking Ling Han.

“Haha, come fight me!” Ling Han naturally wouldn’t be surprised by this. He had long since expected that these six people would gang up on him. The only miscalculation was that Jue Huo would actually be unreliable and go mad.

As Ling Han fought, he continued to retreat. At present, Jue Huo was attacking willfully, and even if the distance was somewhat large, the might of Seventh Tier was still incredibly terrifying. If he was even touched once, he would definitely be injured.

“Today, it will be difficult for you to escape.”

“Dreg of Hysteria’s troops, die!”

The six great elites all unleashed their full power at the first instant. Each of them possessed a second-grade seal, and with the boost, their power increased by more than 70 times. When secret techniques were used, their might was incredibly frightening.

Ling Han also channeled the ninth-grade combination seals. With the amplification of more than 200 times, his battle prowess was definitely not inferior to any Sixth Tier’s, but there were as many as six of them, which naturally gave him tremendous pressure.

This was a very good opportunity to temper himself, Ling Han thought. He had the initiative. Once he tore a rip into the Void, he would be able to return to the Genesis World, and the others could only become lost in the Void because they did not have dimension coordinates.

This was something that he was even more awesome at than Hysteria.

Fight, fight, fight. The seven elites were all fighting with their full strength, and the battle was extremely intense.

This was a fierce battle among elites that were only inferior to the Seventh Tier, so it was naturally incomparably terrifying. Every attack carried force that could destroy the heavens. Thankfully, this was in the Void, or the damage caused would be unimaginable.

“Ah!” In the distant skies, Jue Huo suddenly released a sharp cry. The pressure of the Seventh Tier swept out.

Ling Han and the six great elites felt an involuntary suffocating feeling. This was too terrifying, so even they couldn’t help but stop involuntarily.

And this was still because it was them. If they had only had Fifth-Tier battle prowess, they would definitely have been throwing up blood violently by now.

Xiu! A figure flew down, her speed so great that no one could catch sight of her.

Ling Han and the others were all shocked. They were elites at the peak stage of the Sixth Tier, yet were actually unable to glimpse this figure. This naturally was unbelievable to them.

Seventh Tier, only a Seventh Tier could accomplish this!

Jue Huo appeared. Her red dress was like blood, and her whole body was enshrouded in light that was radiating as if it had a life of its own.

Her appearance remained unchanged, and she was still as breathtakingly beautiful as ever. However, her aura had completely changed.

Previously, she had been innocent and ethereal, but now she was filled with aloofness and a bone-deep killing intent. Even Sixth Tier elites would feel a chill rise from the bottom of their hearts.

There was not the slightest bit of confusion left in her eyes. There was only the indifference of a supreme elite. In her eyes, life itself was worthless.

The six elites were all captivated, and they involuntarily stepped back.

They had ignored the Seventh Tier ultimate elite, and actually joined forces to attack Ling Han. This was absolute treason.

Now that this Seventh Tier was angered, was she going to punish them?
