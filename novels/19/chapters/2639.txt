Chapter 2640: Spent Force?

“This is our opportunity! He’s severely wounded, and he’s even vomiting his blood essence!” Gu Heyi said with loud laughter. With a roar, he immediately charged forward.

Niu Cangyu and the others hurriedly attacked as well. They had to kill Ling Han. Otherwise, since they had already offended Ling Han so deeply, he would definitely seek revenge in the future if he were afforded time to recover. At that time, they naturally couldn’t stop this freak.

Just as Gu Heyi had said, Ling Han’s wounds were truly far too severe.

During the final strike of the tribulation, Ling Han had channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. However, he had already exhausted his energy before that, and the punch had also lingered for far too long. Thus, Ling Han had been left with no option but to combust his blood essence to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Even so, his physique had still been blasted apart by heavenly tribulation, causing him to vomit blood. Moreover, it was because he had been channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll that there were still symbols of the technique pulsating within his blood essence.

Right now, he was in an incredibly feeble state. In fact, even an ordinary Sixth Heaven Celestial King might be able to kill him.

Yet, he was facing the attacks of six powerful elites. What could he do?

Boom!

The attacks arrived. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Peng, peng, peng!

Bursts of energy erupted, instantly evaporating the entire lake. In fact, the entire region beneath them was flattened, creating a sea-sized crater.

Many Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings were unable to dodge in time, and they were all obliterated into smithereens by the devastating shock waves. Many more were also wounded.

The combined attack of the six elites was absolutely petrifying.

Ling Han… was most likely dead.

The six elites paid absolutely no heed to others as they scoured the surroundings for Ling Han’s corpse. However, they found no such thing.

“It can’t be! Our attack was definitely too powerful for that brat to block. However, with the might of his physique, there should at least be a corpse.”

“Perhaps heavenly tribulation was too powerful? And it already damaged his physique?”

“That would be a shame.”

The six elites all wore a deep frown. If Ling Han had been turned into dust, then they would have wasted all these years of hard work and patience. They would have gone to all these lengths for nothing. Thus, they were naturally unwilling to accept this.

This was especially the case for Gu Heyi. He was still hoping for the Greenish Black Flowing Ripple Fruit to advance to the Eighth Heaven, thereby allowing him to rival Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, his plan had fallen apart, so he was naturally feeling extremely stifled, as if he couldn’t find an avenue to unleash his rage.

‘Hmm? I feel like we’ve overlooked something!’

“Are you guys looking for me?” Ling Han’s voice traveled over.

Whoosh!

With a flash, he had already appeared before them.

He was still riddled with wounds, and he was still drenched in blood, his bones exposed. However, his wounds hadn’t become more severe.

Gu Heyi finally connected the dots, exclaiming, “You hid in a Spatial Celestial Tool just then!”

The reality was extremely simple. The six elites had unleashed a fatal strike, yet Ling Han had simply entered his Celestial Guest Residence, leaving it to the Spatial Celestial Tool to face that attack.

After all, this was a Celestial Tool! Something at the Ninth Heaven! In this world, only those with a battle prowess at or above the Ninth Heaven could damage Celestial Tools. Even so, they would still be unable to damage the Divine Metal itself. That being the case, how could those with a battle prowess at the Eighth Heaven possibly damage a Celestial Tool?

Ling Han grinned in reply. Combined with his blood-drenched appearance, this smile appeared as harrowing as could be.

“It’s my turn now?” he asked.

Gu Heyi forcefully calmed himself down, snorted, and said, “So what if you escaped death once? In your current state, how can you possibly be our match? To say nothing of the six of us, even a single one of us can easily suppress you at this moment!”

Ling Han’s condition was far too poor. Thus, what did it matter that he had advanced to the Sixth Heaven? Instead of rising, his battle prowess had instead fallen.

“Is that so?” Ling Han said with a loud laugh.

Boom!

Like a raging tsunami, his aura started to explode.

“How is this possible?!” the six elites exclaimed in shock.

How was Ling Han’s strength still increasing? And at such a rapid speed?

This was impossible! Stabilizing one’s cultivation required a great deal of effort, with even 100 years being a short time. This was especially the case at such a high level. It wouldn’t be impossible that some might still remain in the process of stabilization even after 10 billion years.

Yet, Ling Han had stabilized his cultivation immediately after breaking through? And his battle prowess was increasing several folds over? How was this possible?

“That’s…” Gu Heyi stared at the rolled-up scroll in Ling Han’s left hand. His instinct told him that this was the source of Ling Han’s exploding power.

After staring at it for a moment, his expression suddenly changed, and he exclaimed in deep astonishment. “Dimension Scroll!”

He was a prodigy from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy, and he was even the most powerful disciple enrolled in the past 10 billion years. Thus, it was no surprise that he recognized the Dimension Scroll.

“What Dimension Scroll?” Niu Cangyu and the others asked.

Gu Heyi initially didn’t want to explain. After all, he viewed these five people with contempt. Their cultivation was but a shell, with their battle prowess being as weak as could be. However, since he might need to use these five people, he replied, “After opening a Dimension Scroll, one can obtain the power of heaven and earth and immediately become a Heavenly Venerate.”

“Pu!”

Niu Cangyu and the others immediately spluttered in shock. They were wide-eyed and gaping, and it was as if they had become stupid.

They were indeed transfixed with shock. In comparison, what was the Greenish Black Flowing Ripple Fruit worth? After obtaining it, they would only have a sliver of a chance to advance to the Ninth Heaven. The Dimension Scroll, however? It could directly allow one to become a Heavenly Venerate!

Heavenly Venerate! Even to Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, this was still a lofty and unreachable proposition!

“H-how is this possible?! Such a divine matter actually exists in the world?!” Diao You exclaimed in a trembling voice.

Niu Cangyu and the others also expressed disbelief. Would this not overturn all the iron rules of cultivation? There was absolutely no need to challenge oneself and exert effort! After all, a single scroll could allow one to become a Heavenly Venerate!

Gu Heyi had no option but to say, “It’s not as ideal and simple as you think. The Dimension Scroll can only be opened by those chosen by heaven and earth. However, this is power bestowed by heaven and earth, so heaven and earth can naturally confiscate this power as well. Moreover, those who become Heavenly Venerates in this manner can only become a First Tier Heavenly Venerate at most.”

‘So that’s how it is.’

Niu Cangyu and the others finally understood the implications. However, the gleam in their eyes became increasingly bright.

They finally understood why Ling Han hadn’t activated this divine treasure. This was because he wasn’t the person chosen by heaven and earth!

However… perhaps they were?

Even though such Heavenly Venerates would be controlled by heaven and earth, and even though it would be impossible to advance to the Second Tier, was becoming a Heavenly Venerate not impressive enough already? What else could they wish for?

“Kill him!” Without Gu Heyi needing to tell them, they immediately charged forward with red in their eyes.

For the sake of obtaining the Greenish Black Flowing Ripple Fruit, they would be willing to fight with all their might. However, they definitely wouldn’t risk their lives. After all, as long as they had enough Ascending Dragon Pills and time, they could eventually advance to the Ninth Heaven.

However, becoming a Heavenly Venerate was different. This was valuable enough for them to gamble their lives.

Upon seeing this, a cold smile involuntarily appeared on Gu Heyi’s face. He had withheld a vital piece of information: if one of them were the person chosen by heaven and earth, the Dimension Scroll would automatically react to them.

Right now, however, the Dimension Scroll remained in a state of slumber, signifying that none of them was the chosen person.

Gu Heyi didn’t care much about this. This was because he desired much more than just becoming a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, much less a Heavenly Venerate controlled by Heavenly Venerate.

Did people not cultivate to achieve transcendence?

He naturally wouldn’t reveal this information. Instead, he would let these people bet their lives. In any case, he felt like Ling Han was in an eerie state at this moment.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Niu Cangyu and the others dashed forward, attacking Ling Han as they did so.

Ling Han stepped around to dodge. His wounds were far too severe at this moment, and he was already out of power to channel the Regulations. Thus, he was purely relying on the power of his physical body to move.

“Attack harder! He’s already a spent force!” Niu Cangyu and the others shouted.
