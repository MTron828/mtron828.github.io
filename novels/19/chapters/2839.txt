2840 Fight

“Fight?” Ling Han looked at Rong Yang in surprise. He had not expected that Rong Yang would actually come to invite him to participate in some kind of fight.

Rong Yang nodded. “That’s right, a fight. There are over a dozen of us, and we suppress our cultivation level to a specific level and then fight. The last standing will be able to claim the first place.

“Furthermore, before the fight, we will all sever a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and the first place holder will be able to obtain these seals for himself.”

Ling Han was surprised. There were really heavy stakes on this fight.

However, in a battle of equal cultivation levels, did he have any match? Wasn’t this just delivering treasure straight into his hands?

Ling Han looked at Rong Yang. Though his grudge with the Rong Clan had been resolved by Lin Xiaoyang, his relationship with the Rong Clan could not be considered amiable. Why would Rong Yang push such a good opportunity onto him?

Rong Yang could tell the doubt in Ling Han’s eyes. He smiled bitterly. “I have no intention to choose you to profit. However, recently, a monster has suddenly popped up. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, there is no one that is his match, and I lost very terribly.”

“Oh?” Ling Han was slightly surprised. Though Rong Yang was not the strongest in his cultivation level, he had also accommodated a great many Powers of Dimension when he had been in the First Tier. Under circumstances when both parties were equal in cultivation level, there should not be many that could defeat him.

“Could it be that it was either Xin Qihu or Wu Haoyang that made a move?”

Rong Yang shook his head. “We aren’t idiots, so how could we fight them if it was them? That man’s name is Meng Dong. No one knows his background, but within the cultivation level of the Second Tier, he can be considered invincible.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Thus, you have come to find me?” Ling Han looked towards Rong Yang.

“Ling Han, you are already able to match a Fourth Tier when you are only in the Second Tier. However, this may not be an ability that you alone possess,” Rong Yang said seriously. “In a battle of equal cultivation level, none of us could match Meng Dong. Afterwards, he relaxed the restrictions, and allowed us to use Third Tier’s power to fight him. As a result, we were still horribly defeated.

“In the end, he allowed us to fight him with Fourth-Tier power again, but the result… Most of us still lost.

“And just like this, he has deceived us three times. Everyone has lost three Heavenly Venerable Seals.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel tempted. Rong Yang said that there were over a dozen of them, so whenever Meng Dong won, he would be able to obtain more than a dozen Heavenly Venerable Seals, and if it was three times, there had to be 40-50 Heavenly Venerable Seals that he had obtained.

Ling Han’s great luck was already shocking enough, yet now he still only had 14 Heavenly Venerable Seals, and seven among them were the more widely known Heavenly Venerable Seals, which was something that practically every single Heavenly Venerate possessed, so they could not be counted.

They were both in the Second Tier, but the gap between them was quite wide.

“Come, let’s go take a look then.” Ling Han immediately decided. He really would like to see who, besides himself, could be so freakish.

Ling Han did not call over the Empress, Hu Niu and the others, and directly set out with Rong Yang.

He did not fear that Rong Yang was trying to trick him, because he could traverse freely through the Genesis World, so who could stop him? Of course, Hysteria was also a party that could not be overlooked. It seemed to have set its eyes on him, and he kept encountering it in the Void.

After journeying for a few months, they arrived on top of a great mountain. There were a great many people gathered here, and they were all Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han was surprised. The present world was in complete chaos, and even Heavenly Venerates were all fearing for themselves. Why had so many people still come out, and so boldly and publicly at that?

However, once Rong Yang explained, Ling Han understood the reason.

That was because all the Heavenly Venerates here came from powerful backgrounds. Either they had fathers or grandfathers who were Fifth Tier or Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, or it was their master or grand elder that was an elite of this level. As long as there was no power that could kill them all in one fell swoop, there only had to be one that managed to escape, and those Heavenly Venerates would unite in vengeance. What force in this world would be able to stand against that?

Of course, if any of them were caught alone, it would be hard to say.

Ling Han saw a great many energetic, young Heavenly Venerates who had only been cultivating for one to two epochs, and there were some even younger that had only been cultivating for tens of billions of years, yet they had already advanced to the Second Tier or even Third Tier, which was truly extraordinary.

He couldn’t help but feel rueful. Though the world was completely chaotic, this had also led to the rise of a great many prodigies.

However, wasn’t it said that there were only over a dozen people fighting? The number of people here was not just a dozen, but at least over 100.

Even Rong Yang was a little stunned. Previously, there had indeed been only over a dozen of them fighting here.

“Probably many people went to ask for help, unwilling to resign themselves to being deceived by Meng Dong, and wanted to win back their pride. In fact, they may even be having designs on those Heavenly Venerable Seals that Meng Dong obtained,” Rong Yang guessed.

Ling Han nodded. That was at least 40-50 Heavenly Venerable Seals, and even he was slightly tempted whether he should commit a murder and robbery.

“Rong Yang, is this the helper that you have invited?” A yellow-robed young man walked over. He had a lanky build, and the aura exuding from him had also reached the Fourth Tier.

Rong Yang nodded. “He is Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” The yellow-robed young man showed a hint of surprise. “The Ling Han who broke records at the Realm Battlefield?”

“That’s him.” Rong Yang nodded.

“Haha, Brother Ling, I am Qiu Jian.” The yellow-robed young man clasped his hands in greeting towards Ling Han. “I have long since heard of your name.”

Since he was treating him politely, Ling Han would naturally not behave arrogantly, either. He nodded, and also greeted him. “Brother Qiu Jian.”

While they were chatting here, it also attracted the people around them. When they heard the legendary Ling Han was here, a great many people were intrigued. After all, the record that Ling Han had set in the past had really never been achieved before, and it was extremely possible that no one would ever match it.

However, some newly promoted Heavenly Venerates expressed disdain towards Ling Han. They had only heard of Ling Han’s legends, but had not witnessed his feats personally. Thus, their attitude was to doubt everything, and they thought that they themselves were the strongest.

“Ling Han, do you dare to fight us?” Someone immediately issued a challenge towards Ling Han.

This was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. He was indeed very extraordinary. He had only been cultivating for 10 billion years, and he had already reached this level. Merely in terms of speed, he really had surpassed Ling Han by who knew how many times.

Hence, he looked down on Ling Han very much. A Second Tier who had only reached this level in over an epoch? That was so weak.

“I, too, wish to fight with this legendary prodigy,” another Heavenly Venerate said. He was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, but the fight could begin after they suppressed their cultivation levels, so even if there was a big gap in cultivation level, it was no great issue.

“Me too.” This was another Heavenly Venerate, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate as well.

Challengers stepped out one after another, and there were as many as over a dozen of them. They all wanted to become famous by stepping on Ling Han’s shoulders. After all, Ling Han had indeed left behind a legend in the Realm Battlefield in the past.

Ling Han smiled. The main lead was not even here yet, and there were already people ready to present him with some Heavenly Venerable Seals?

He deliberately revealed a troubled expression. “There is only one of me, but there are over a dozen of you…”

With how hesitant he seemed, everyone thought that he was afraid.

“This is not a group battle. We are going to fight one by one.”

“That’s right; we are not going to bully you.”

“Do you dare!?”

The people who had previously provoked him all exclaimed, wanting to egg Ling Han on to fight.

Ling Han considered again, and then nodded. “All right then.”

Those people who had challenged him were all overjoyed, but then Ling Han continued, “However, I fear my divine might would scare you guys off. Thus, anyone who wants to challenge or fight me should step out and sever their Heavenly Venerable Seals first. I am afraid that you guys will not be fighting later.”

...

This was his real motive. Otherwise, if he blasted a fighter to bits with just a single punch, would the others still dare to fight him?

“Who would be afraid!” those fighters all declared, their heads raised high.
