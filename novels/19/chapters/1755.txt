Chapter 1756: Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts

Was this not a nonsensical question!

Ling Han only stared at that bell. If he was able to defeat Ding Yaolong, why did he have to declare that he would come back again in the future?

He was only a first severance, and no matter how freakish he was, he was still just a first severance. He could defeat all opponents in the second severance, and just barely matching the early stage of the third severance already made him a freak among freaks. As for the fourth severance... the gap was really too wide.

As Ding Yaolong waved the bell, it released an endless black Qi, and he declared, “This is called the Black Mist Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts! Innumerable years ago, the ancestors of our Ding Clan had already begun to refine it. However, refining this object would require the sacrifice of innumerable living souls.

“To avoid being erased by divine punishment, every ancestor would only refine a small portion, and after innumerable years, it has finally been refined successfully.

“If it was not for the fact that your potential is too frightening, despicable brat, I really would not want to expose the secret of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts yet!”

The black mists surged out, turning into an ocean, and multiple skulls appeared in the hazy ocean, releasing sharp cries that could easily make any Severing Mundane Tier bleed from all the seven apertures. If an ordinary first severance was here, his soul would probably be separated from his physical body easily with a few waves of this bell.

“Tight situation, retreat!” The large black dog broke into a run and fled. “I will retreat first, the mission of the envoy of justice will be up to you, brat!”

At this moment, it did not have a sliver of seriousness left.

If anyone actually trusted this large black dog, that person was definitely too naive and kind.

Ling Han also leaped to the Empress’s side. If there was the slightest danger, the two of them would enter into the Black Tower together.

“Humph, before the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, you still think you can escape alive?” Ding Yaolong asked coldly. He had summoned even this kind of top-secret weapon, so he was naturally filled with the determination to kill Ling Han.

Among the ghostly wails and shrill cries, innumerable skulls pounced towards Ling Han and the Empress, each of them possessing the battle prowess of a third severance!

Though it was only the third severance, just how many were there?

More than 10,000!

Thus, putting aside the fact that Ling Han and the Empress were only in the first severance, even if it was a fourth severance grand elder facing this kind of precious Tool, he would probably only be able to flee pitifully. True, if the might of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts was not so strong, what need would there be for the ancestors of the Ding Clan to refine it undertaking the risk of sustaining divine punishment for so many generations?

“Mere spirits, scram!” Ling Han shouted loudly, releasing the Nine Heavens Flame.

Boom, the fiery flames surged out, turning into a circle which protected himself and the Empress inside.

This was effective, compelling the skulls to stay outside the circle. Yet the skulls in front would pounce, followed quickly by those behind, and when each skull collided with the circle, they would expend a portion of the flames. If this went on, it would not take long before they would be able to invade the circle.

Even so, Ding Yaolong was still incredibly stunned. If it was him that was besieged by the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, the situation would definitely not be much better than what Ling Han was facing now.

But who was he? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This naturally was the credit of the Nine Heavens Flame. The ancestral flames of the heaven and earth were incredibly dominating. Unfortunately, Ling Han’s cultivation level was too low, which limited the might of the Nine Heavens Flame. Otherwise, let alone whatever Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, even Celestial Kings would shiver at the sight of it.

No matter how freakish this despicable brat was, he finally would not be able to escape the fate of death now.

Ding Yaolong revealed a slightly twisted expression, and declared, “Despicable brat, after you’re dead, I will snatch away all your fated opportunities, and as for the woman beside you, I will turn into a beautiful corpse, and I am sure that a great many people would be willing to toy with her.”

With his identity, he should not have said such threats, but who asked Ling Han to have destroyed the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan twice, and Ding Yaolong’s heart was really filled with too much hatred.

If he did not say a few words at this moment, he would not be able to appease his anger even if he tore Ling Han into pieces.

“I never thought that you are this type of person, Ding Yaolong.” The large black dog had circled back, and appeared behind Ding Yaolong. It immediately aimed a bite at him.

“Ah!” Ding Yaolong cried out in pain. He had not imagined that the large black dog would appear and disappear so suddenly, and was able to emerge behind him without any prior signs like this. This bite landed very solidly on him.

In the past, when the large black dog had not yet become a Celestial, Han Lu, who was similarly a fourth severance, had still sustained a harsh bite from the large black dog. And now that the large black dog had advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, even if Ding Yaolong was slightly stronger than Han Lu, his actual gap with the large black dog had actually shrunken many times over.

This bite caused Ding Yaolong’s spine to straighten suddenly, and his hips abruptly leaned forwards.

“See Grandpa Dog’s Monkey Stealing Peaches[1]!” The large black dog was prepared for this. It released its bite and turned around, quickly arriving in front of Ding Yaolong. Then, it shot out a firm leg, harshly kicking over, and hitting directly at Ding Yaolong’s raised crotch.

Pa, the sound of n*ts being crushed rang out.

Even if Ding Yaolong was a fourth severance grand elder, so what? This was not just having his n*ts ache, but having even his n*ts crushed.

“Ah...” He released a sharp wail, his legs suddenly clenching tightly together, and even his face having turned pale.

“Grandpa Dog’s last strike of the three consecutive moves, Crippling Chrysanthemum[2]!” The large black dog circled around behind Ding Yaolong, and stabbed his dog’s paw straight into the latter’s behind.

“Ah!” This time, Ding Yaolong’s cry was really felt with overwhelming agony. His @nus having sustained a severe injury, he screamed in pain once more, the misery in his voice indescribable.

“Success, retreat!” The large black dog broke into a run and fled. Its style had always been sneak attacks and cheap tricks.

As for head-on confrontation? Ah, what did that mean? Grandpa Dog had absolutely no idea.

Ding Yaolong clenched his legs tightly together, one hand covering his behind, while the other was still holding onto the bell. No matter how one looked at it, this scene was really out of sorts.

Ling Han couldn’t help but break into raucous laughter. The large black dog’s cheap tricks followed one after another. In the future, he really could not afford to be careless around it. This cunning dog made no distinction between allies and enemies. If he did not take caution, and fell for one of its tricks in future, he wouldn’t even have anywhere to cry.

In this manner, Ding Yaolong was rendered unable to continue to spin the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, and his attack dispersed by itself without Ling Han having to do anything to resolve it.

“Ding Yaolong!” A gruff shout rang out, and the grand elder of the Long Clan appeared, his expression cold as ice. “I did not think that your Ding Clan had actually refined such a vicious Evil Tool in secret; no wonder the clansmen of our Long Clan would occasionally disappear. As it turned out, they had all fallen into your poisonous hands!”

Xiu, another figure appeared. The grand elder of the Duan Clan had also come. His eyes were also fixed on the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts menacingly.

“Ding Yaolong, I need an explanation from you today!” he stated calmly, but an incomparable determination was clear in his tone.

All of a sudden, Ding Yaolong actually became the target of a combined interrogation from two great fourth severance grand elders.

These two were not Han Lu, but were true prodigies. The victor would be difficult to decide if it was a duel, but in a battle of two against one, he would definitely be in trouble! Of course, if it really exploded into a fierce battle, he would definitely be able to inflict severe injury, or even cause death to at least one of them at the cost of his life.

Ding Yaolong humphed, and declared, “What do I need to explain? Get out of the way, both of you. Otherwise, I will slaughter the two of you as well!”

No matter what, he was definitely going to kill Ling Han today.

Da, da, da. Blood was dripping from both the crotch of his trousers and behind, and accompanied by his present cold and aloof expression, the force of the impact was quite strong.

Though the grand elders Duan and Long were both furious and filled with hate, when they saw this miserable appearance of Ding Yaolong, especially when he was holding his legs tightly together as if he had been raped, their aged faces involuntarily twitched. They really f****** wanted to laugh!

Their urge to laugh was seen by Ding Yaolong, and he couldn’t help but tremble in fury. Two elites of the same level were actually smiling at him!

Their smiles were not of friendliness; instead, they were laughing at him.

He was very angry, no, close to exploding with fury!

“All of you, die!!” he roared loudly, and the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts was used once more.
