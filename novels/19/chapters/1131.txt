Chapter 1132: Majestic Heaven Sect

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The starship arrived near Ling Han, but did not stop. It merely slowed down.

When the starship was started, it would expend the largest number of True Origin Stones. Thus, even if they were willing to allow Ling Han to come aboard, there was completely no need for them to deliberately stop the starship. They merely had to slow down.

Ling Han shot over. The starship did not stretch out its defenses, but this was very normal. With no danger anywhere, what was the point of pulling out the defense shield? It would be a complete waste of True Origin Stones.

He landed on the deck, and there were already three men waiting for him there.

“How may I address you?” one man asked. He was an elite of Sun Moon Tier, his aura powerful, forming a suppression in terms of pure level. At first, he was very cautious, but when he sensed that Ling Han’s aura was only of Mountain River Tier, he immediately relaxed.

Ling Han clasped his fists together in greeting, and said, “My name is Han Lin. Previously, I encountered galactic pirates and managed to fortunately escape. However, now that I have lost my starship, I am unable to progress to my destination. Thankfully, you all came across me and saved me.”

Since that assaulter thought he had succeeded, why shouldn’t he temporarily keep his identity secret, and gain an environment in which he could be allowed to peacefully grow?

“So it is young friend Han.” The man nodded. Though he was not sure of the authenticity of Ling Han’s words, if he claimed that he had been purposely waiting for them here, and laid a trap or something, he was not about to believe that. After all, the galaxy was too massive, so who would be able to grasp the ship route of another?

“Where are you heading to, young friend?” he asked again.

“Flying Cloud Planet,” Ling Han replied.

The man couldn’t help but smile, and said, “Then it is really coincidental. We are also heading to the Flying Cloud Planet, so we shall bring you along with us, young friend.”

“Many thanks!” Ling Han quickly said. In this Immortal Realm, where power meant everything, it was actually very rare for an elite to be amicable to others.

The man waved him off, and had one of his subordinates bring Ling Han below deck to rest.

Ling Han exchanged conventional greetings with that person, and found out that this was the tradeship of the Mo Clan. That large man previously was named Mo Gu, and was a core person of the Mo Clan.

The Mo Clan was based on the Southern Plentiful Planet, but because it was dealing in the intergalactic trading of goods, they also had a branch on various major planets and in major Majestic Empires, which caused the standing of the Mo Clan to be very extraordinary—if the Southern Plentiful Majestic Empire wanted to harm them, all they had to do was switch location, and begin turning their new home into a new base.

On this trip, they were delivering a large amount of goods to the Flying Cloud Planet. It was really a coincidence; they had only veered off their initial flight route to take a look because Ling Han’s heavenly tribulation had attracted them.

Ling Han made a note of this favor secretly in his heart. When they lent him a helping hand, they might not have thought of asking him to repay the favor, but if he was really ungrateful, then he was really not a man.

He had indeed veered far off from the flight route from the Joint Peace Planet to the Flying Cloud Planet. However, his luck was not too bad, as he was not too far away from the Flying Cloud Planet. Thus, they merely had to travel for about another seven days, and the starship would be able to land on the Flying Cloud Planet.

Naturally, it was impossible that Mo Gu, as an elite of Sun Moon Tier, would take note of a “minor character” like Ling Han. In the following seven days, he had not paid Ling Han a visit, and only when the starship landed, and they disembarked, did Ling Han finally see him again. He once again expressed his thanks to the latter.

Ling Han bought a map in the city, and, according to the map, realized that he was not far off from the Majestic Heaven Sect.

There were actually only two Majestic Empires on the Flying Cloud Planet: the Four Seas Majestic Empire and the Great Heaven Majestic Empire. Furthermore, the territories of these two Majestic Empires added together were not as large as the territory occupied by the Majestic Heaven Sect.

There was nothing to be done. Though Venerable Trinity had clearly expressed that they had no interest in taking over the world, it was a fact that the Majestic Heaven Sect had occupied such an expansive territory. How could the two Majestic Empires dare to attack them for the purpose of obtaining more territory?

On the other hand, it was already quite good that the Majestic Empires were allowed to exist. Moreover, if the territory of an Eternal River Tier elite was even smaller than Heavenly Body Tier, how could it be acceptable?

Thus, the current situation was something that all sides could accept and were satisfied with.

Ling Han was presently in the Great Heaven Majestic Empire, and there was about a month’s journey from here to the gates of the Majestic Heaven Sect, the Heavenly Wind Mountain. And this was taking into account the speed of the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. If it was him using his own legs to travel, that would take half a year at least.

“Let’s set out!”

Ling Han took out the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, and set off towards the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Seven days later, he had entered into the territory of the Majestic Heaven Sect, but it was only after another 20-odd days that he finally arrived at the mountain gates of the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Hiss, no wonder it was called the Majestic Heaven Sect!

In front of him, there was a mountain peak so high that it towered into the clouds. Even if he activated the Eye of Truth, he could not see the peak. It was probably tens of thousands of meters tall, at least.

This was the main peak of the Heavenly Wind Mountains, Cloud Piercing Peak.

Aside from the main peak, there were seven other subsidiary peaks. Similarly, they were extremely tall, but they were appropriately located, so there was not a single mountain peak that was as tall as another.

Now that he had arrived here, he could not travel around with the Cloud Piercing Shuttle as he liked. Ling Han steered the Cloud Piercing Shuttle into a descent, and put it away. Then, he began to travel on foot.

This was an important territory of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and there were a great many places where no entry was allowed, and where various restrictions were set up. There were also disciples of the sect responsible for regular patrols.

Ling Han was not here to swindle or cheat, so he had absolutely no intention of using the Black Tower to enter into forbidden territory. Instead, he travelled along the main path, and arrived at the foot of a subsidiary peak.

After he made some queries, he found out that outsiders usually were not allowed to trespass into the main peak and seven subsidiary peaks. However, it was a different case in these few days. There were a few seeded disciples in the sect that were currently recruiting followers, which had attracted a great many people to come and apply for the position.

Previously, it had already been explained. Only seeded disciples were qualified to recruit followers, and if one became a follower, aside from being unable to gain any resources for cultivation, there was actually no difference in their treatment and the treatment of official disciples. They could even listen from the sidelines when the seeded disciple was being taught by Venerable Trinity!

How massive was that kind of lure?

Discounting those who did not manage to enter into the Majestic Heaven Sect, even inside the Majestic Heaven Sect itself, there were a great many ordinary disciples that strived with their all to become the followers of some seeded disciples.

Moreover, it was definite that every seed would definitely become a supreme elite—they would be an existence at the consummate level of Sun Moon Tier at least, since the barrier to the Heavenly Body Tier was really too hard to breach. However, wasn’t the consummate level of Sun Moon Tier awesome enough?

If they could rely on their help and stay by the side of such elites, it would be of extremely great help to their future development.

In short, the foot of one of the subsidiary peaks, White Cloud Peak, was currently packed with people. They all longed to become the followers of one of the seeds.

Every seed could only possess three followers at most. Naturally, that was not enough to satisfy the masses, and it was something that they would be fighting desperately over.

“Stand aside, stand aside!” A commotion was heard from behind them. Four men were clearing the path, and behind them, there was a gloomy-looking young man. His vitality was strong, so he was indeed very young, but his cultivation level had shockingly reached the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, which was very astonishing.

“Who is this? Being so arrogant and overbearing, could it be a key disciple?” someone nearby asked.

“You don’t even know who he is?”

“Why should I know him?”

“Hehe, he is Zhang Tong, Lord Yang Hao’s follower.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What, Yang Hao!? You mean that super genius who had used a mere 600 years to reach Sun Moon Tier, that Lord Yang Hao!?”

“Of course!”

“Hiss... Still, however awesome, it is Lord Yang, so what does it have to do with him?”

“You don’t know, right? Zhang Tong had once been a key disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect, and purposely surrendered this identity to follow Lord Yang! At the time, many people said he was dumb, but what about now? There are even some seeded prodigies that wish to follow Lord Yang; unfortunately, Lord Yang is completely disdainful of them!”

“What, is it real?”

As they spoke, those four people in charge of clearing the path had walked to stand behind Ling Han. The others had all obediently allowed them to pass, which made Ling Han appear very prominent.
