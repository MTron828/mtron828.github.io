Chapter 2101: Son’s rival in love

“That’s right, since that Junior Brother Ling of yours clings to you so much, why don’t I see him accompany you here?” Ling Han asked.

“Don’t bring it up. This guy recently offended someone, and is presently being reprimanded!” Chen Shuangshuang shook her head, showing an expression of anger.

“What’s the matter?” Bewitching Maiden Rou hurriedly asked.

“This brat, he’s so stubborn and hard-headed. He has clearly already become a core disciple, and if he gave it some more effort, he may even be able to enter into the ranks of Holy Sons. Furthermore, the granddaughter of Grand Elder Jiuhua has also set her eye on him, and has the intention to marry him. But what did this brat do? He actually refused!”

Chen Shuangshuang’s expression was filled with indignant fury at his lack of drive. “This stupid brat, even if he was going to refuse, he could be more tactful about it. But what did he do? Not only did he refuse directly and immediately, he even said that he has someone else that he likes. So stupid!”

“And now what? Grand Elder Jiuhua is already angered, and commanded that he be imprisoned, saying that he would only be released when he changed his mind.”

“Sigh, so how stupid can this brat be?”

As Chen Shuangshuang spoke, she kept looking at Bewitching Maiden Rou, her expression very colorful.

Ling Han and the others exchanged looks, the same thought rising up in their heads. ‘You’re the stupid one here!

‘For your sake, Ling Jianxue did not hesitate to offend a grand elder, yet you are still calling him stupid.’

Sigh, they had never seen as great a blockhead as she was.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “He is truly a silly brat.” To actually fall for such a careless, simple-minded girl.

They roamed around in the Dark Forest for seven days, and gathered many Numbing Clouds Mushrooms. They were only missing one more, and Chen Shuangshuang would be able to complete her mission.

“We’re finally almost done. I’m so tired,” Chen Shuangshuang panted. Actually, with her cultivation level of third severance, how could she possibly feel tired? She was just putting on an act.

Shua, shua, shua. The bushes ahead of them suddenly began to shake.

“There’s a wild beast!” She immediately became alert.

Shua, the bushes separated, and a young man in white robes walked out. He was quite good-looking, with a lanky build and a cultivation level of fourth severance.

“Junior Sister Chen!” this white-robed young man immediately called out.

Chen Shuangshuang was startled. “Yang Xiao? Yi, why are you here?”

“Oh, I have also gotten a mission to gather Numbing Clouds Mushrooms. I never thought I would so coincidentally meet you here,” the white-robed young man, Yang Xiao, replied with a smile, but there was clearly a sliver of self-satisfaction in his eyes.

Not only had he deliberately accepted the same mission as Chen Shuangshuang, he had also sacrificed a great amount. He had dripped some Dew Liquid on Chen Shuangshuang, which provided guidance for him, allowing him to chase her all the way here.

Just when he was about to catch up to her, he then circled around to be ahead of her, and pretend that it was a coincidental meeting with her.

“What a real coincidence!” Chen Shuangshuang was too careless, and did not doubt him in the slightest.

Ling Han saw this, and with a thought, a killing intent rose up in his heart.

That little brat, he actually dared to target his son’s wife?

However, he immediately suppressed this killing intent. Chen Shuangshuang was not an object that belonged to anyone, so it was natural that anyone could start courting her. Success or failure would depend on their respective strategies.

Of course, if Yang Xiao was going to do anything underhanded, he would definitely move without mercy.

“Yi, Junior Sister Chen, these five are…” What Yang Xiao had not expected was that Chen Shuangshuang was actually not alone, but was rather with five other people. Furthermore, three of the women among them were captivatingly beautiful, being so exquisite that he almost lost control of himself.

“Oh, they are all Junior Brother Ling Jianxue’s relatives,” Chen Shuangshuang said.

This was the honest truth, but a careless person like Chen Shuangshuang had not asked just what kind of relation they had with him.

“Junior Brother Ling’s relatives?” Yang Xiao’s eyes roamed over Ling Han and his group, yet could not tell anything from their appearance.

He was only a fourth severance, and it would truly be a strange thing if he managed to distinguish the depths of Dividing Soul Tiers.

“So you are Junior Brother Ling’s relatives.” He clasped his hands in greeting. Though his tone was very polite, his animosity was clearly revealed in his eyes.

It was only Chen Shuangshuang that did not know that Ling Jianxue was fond of her. For her sake, he had even rejected the granddaughter of a grand elder, and this almost caused Yang Xiao to die of jealousy. If it was him, he would definitely accept happily.

Grand Elder Jiuhua was a Celestial King, and a Third Heaven Celestial King at that. If he could become his grandson-in-law, his future prospects would definitely be boundless.

Why wasn’t it him?

Additionally, Yang Xiao also thought that Ling Jianxue was too stupid.

If it was him, he would definitely agree first. There was no rule that said a man could only marry one wife. He could absolutely hook up with Chen Shuangshuang in the future instead.

“Junior Sister Chen, I have already completed my mission. What about you?” Yang Xiao pulled his attention back. Since he did not have the good luck that Ling Jianxue had in romance, he could only concentrate his focus and energy on Chen Shuangshuang.

Though this girl was careless and simple-minded, her natural talent in cultivation was very high, and she was also pretty. She was the best candidate for his dao partner.

“I’m still missing one.” Chen Shuangshuang sighed, and slanted a sideways glare at Ling Han. If it had not been because of this guy, she would definitely have been able to finish her job too by now.

“Then let me accompany you, Junior Sister,” Yang Xiao quickly offered.

“Sure.” Chen Shuangshuang accepted without hesitation.

If it was only Yang Xiao, she would still hesitate for a while, but since there were also Ling Han and his group with them, she wouldn’t worry about having Yang Xiao with her—just the two of them alone was definitely not something allowed.

Ling Han stroked his chin as his gaze roved over Yang Xiao.

It was naturally not right to kill him just because this person was his son’s rival in love. However, while killing him was not right, they could still mess around with him.

How should they give him a hard time?

As a father, he had missed his son’s growth, and being unable to stay by his son’s side for so many years, Ling Han did not mind doing some protective actions for the sake of his son.

This was how wilful a father could be!

Another day later, they found the final Numbing Clouds Mushroom, and completed the task. In the meantime, Ling Han and the others also caused trouble intentionally, ruining several of Yang Xiao’s attempts to become close with Chen Shuangshuang, causing this guy to feel great resentment.

Now, this guy completely believed that Ling Han and the others were Ling Jianxue’s close relatives. Otherwise, why else would they be so proactively ruining the pleasant matters between himself and Chen Shuangshuang?

Damn!

After a day had passed, he had already tolerated Ling Han and his group, especially Ling Han, enough. Thankfully, now that the mushroom gathering mission was completed, he and Chen Shuangshuang would be returning to the Heavenly Saint Palace, and they could then go a separate way with these five people. There was no further need for him to worry that when he was courting Chen Shuangshuang, a tree would suddenly collapse, the earth would suddenly crack, or a wild beast would suddenly scuttle out of nowhere.

“We’re going to the Roc Palace, which is on the way as well. We can separate once we reach Roc Heaven,” Ling Han said smilingly.

“Sure!” Chen Shuangshuang was immediately excited. She could have a few more days to see the three beautiful, fairy-like big sisters.

Yang Xiao’s expression darkened completely at this, though. His eyes became menacing as he wanted nothing more than to skin Ling Han alive.

‘Haven’t you guys caused enough harm to me? You guys still plan to pursue us and continue to cause trouble?’

Once or twice, one to two days, and he could still bear with it, but if you guys had no sense of propriety like this, he could not continue to tolerate it, either. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Humph, did they really think that he was a pushover?

A killing intent rose up in him. Ling Han definitely had to be killed, but as for these three women… With how beautiful they were, it would be too much of a waste to just kill them like that.

Then, he would capture them first. If they agreed to become his women, he would spare their lives. Otherwise, he would rape them and then kill them!

His heart set, he immediately revealed a smile, and said, “The close relatives of Junior Brother Ling would be my own close relatives. I want nothing more than for you guys to spend a few more days with us.”
