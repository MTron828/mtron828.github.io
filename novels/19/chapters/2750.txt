2751 Smeared

“Ling Feifan, how did you come back?”

“Exactly, weren’t you captured? How did you come back?”

Everyone asked this in curiosity.

Before Ling Feifan could even answer, he saw a young man pushing his way through the crowd and making his way over, saying, “Ling Feifan, did you surrender to the enemy? Is that why they released you back as a spy?”

Upon hearing this, a wave of commotion spread through the crowd.

Ling Feifan was infuriated, and he shouted, “Jiang Yiran, don’t you dare smear me!”

“Heh, your family isn’t from our dimension, so it won’t be a surprise if you guys surrender and betray us,” the young man scoffed.

This person was called Jiang Yiran. As for why he was targeting Ling Feifan, the reason for this was simple. This was because a girl that he liked had extremely strong feelings for Ling Feifan. As a result, he always targeted Ling Feifan no matter the situation.

This time, the opportunity was even better. As a measly First Heaven Celestial King, he had actually managed to escape alive after being captured and brought to a foreign dimension? And he hadn’t suffered a single wound?

He had fled back himself? Who would believe this? There was definitely something fishy about this.

“You bastard!” Ling Feifan roared, unleashing his killing intent. This accusation was far too severe. This person was extremely underhanded, and if his smear truly stuck, then it wouldn’t only be him who was punished. His parents would be dragged into the mess as well.

“What? You want to kill me to keep this a secret?” Jiang Yiran said, sticking his neck forward.

He wasn’t afraid of Ling Feifan, as he was also a First Heaven Celestial King. He was confident that no one at the same cultivation level could defeat him.

“Bastard, I’ll pummel you to death!” Ling Feifan roared as he charged forward and threw a punch at Jiang Yiran.

“Sure enough, you’ve been shamed enough to erupt in anger now that I’ve exposed you!” Jiang Yiran said with a cold chuckle. He raised his hands to form a seal before his body, and said, “Hurry, ask the lords to come over. We need to thoroughly interrogate—”

Pu!

As he was speaking, Ling Feifan’s fist also arrived.

Ling Feifan’s body had already been tempered by Ling Han, so he now possessed a powerful Body Art. Even if he couldn’t compare to the Ling Han of yore, his power was still quite extraordinary.

Under this punch, Jiang Yiran’s arms were both brutally broken, and he was more so sent flying into the sky.

Peng!

He flew back, with the dozen or so people behind him acting as human cushions. Only after skidding back a huge distance did they finally grind to a halt. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jiang Yiran was absolutely stunned. Ling Feifan had only been gone for a few years, so how had he suddenly become so powerful?

“Look at this! Just look at this! You definitely surrendered to the enemy. Otherwise, how could you have become so powerful?” he screamed. Channeling his Source Power, he slowly healed his arms.

“Are you truly seeking death?” Ling Feifan asked in a baleful voice. With Ling Han standing beside him, he was naturally filled with confidence. It was also because of this that he didn’t try to explain himself.

“Are you threatening me?” Jiang Yiran said with a loud laugh. “Even if you can shut me up, can you shut up the mouths of everyone in the world?”

He was intent on smearing Ling Feifan as much as he could. In any case, Ling Feifan’s return was far too strange and suspicious to begin with, so it was extremely easy to sling mud and make it stick.

Ling Feifan gave a soft shout as he lashed out again, launching another attack at Jiang Yiran.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

In just a few strikes, Jiang Yiran already became as disheveled as could be. Before a combination of Body Art and Regulations, how could he possibly resist?

“Ling Feifan, that’s enough.”

“Exactly. There’s genuinely a lot you need to explain.”

The others couldn’t watch on any longer, and they all stepped forward to stop Ling Feifan.

Ling Feifan flew into a rage, and he shouted, “He’s been smearing me this entire time, so why did none of you step forward to stop him, huh?”

Everyone was rendered speechless. In their minds, however, they all mused that even though Jiang Yiran had taken things too far, his accusations had indeed been aligned with their own doubts.

“Who’s causing trouble in the army camp?” a voice that was filled with dignity and might said. They looked over, only to see an elegant man in white appearing, not a speck of dust on his clothes.

Many females instantly gazed at him with respect and reverence. This man in white was called Shen Bo, and he was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

There were few Heavenly Venerates in this low-level dimension, so Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could almost be regarded as the most powerful elites. Thus, he naturally made their hearts flutter.

Jiang Yiran hurriedly clasped his hands, and said, “My respects to Lord Shen!”

Ling Feifan also stopped his attacks, saying, “Lord Shen.”

Shen Bo raised his hand slightly before looking at Ling Feifan in surprise, and saying, “You’re back? What about the other prisoners?”

‘How would I know?’ Ling Feifan said in his mind.

Because of his relationship with An Xiu’er, he had been directly brought to the An Clan. Thus, he naturally didn’t know about the others’ situation.

He shook his head, and replied, “I don’t know.”

“Why don’t you know?” Shen Bo said in a stern voice. “How did you escape?”

Ling Feifan suppressed his anger, and said, “Since I’ve already returned, I’ll naturally explain everything in detail. However, my parents are still worried about me, so can you allow me to visit them first?”

“If you’ve defected to the enemy, that’s a most serious crime, so how can you still be allowed to visit anyone?” Jiang Yiran interjected.

Shen Bo wore an expression of displeasure upon hearing this. He was currently speaking, so who had the right to cut him off? However, Jiang Yiran’s words were his thoughts as well, so he simply glared at Jiang Yiran, but didn’t reprimand him.

“The actions of I, Ling Feifan, will let down neither heaven and earth nor my own conscience!” Ling Feifan said loudly. “By treating me like this, are you not afraid of bitterly disappointing me?”

“If you’re truly innocent, then what do you have to be afraid of?” Shen Bo said sternly. “Make haste and explain yourself!”

“Feifan!” Right at this moment, two voices sounded in unison, and a man and a woman immediately flew over.

Ling Jianxue! Chen Shuangshuang!

“Father! Mother!” Ling Feifan hurriedly called. After he was captured, they had definitely prepared for the worst. Now that they were reunited, they all felt like they had been apart for a lifetime.

The three of them were just about to embrace, yet Shen Bo immediately stopped them, and said, “You two, your son has very likely committed the crime of defecting to the enemy, so before we understand the situation fully, he needs to undergo interrogation first.”

Ling Jianxue was enraged upon hearing this. The small family of three had come here to fight for a foreign world, yet they were now being accused of defecting to the enemy?

Because of his incandescent rage, Ling Jianxue failed to even notice Ling Han. In any case, Ling Han’s hair was still disheveled and his face was still dirty, and it had more so been over an epoch since they had last seen each other. Thus, how would he suspect that this person was his father?

“Shen Bo, step aside!” he said in a baleful voice.

It was because he was a righteous person who couldn’t stand to see a weaker person being bullied by a stronger person that he had decided to battle for the Promise City Realm. In fact, he had stuck to this principle throughout his journey through the numerous dimensions. Now, however, his thankless sacrifice had earned him the accusation of his son being a traitorous defector? How could he accept this?

“Ling Jianxue, don’t tell me you want to get physical with me?” Shen Bo said coldly. He was naturally unafraid.

“And what if we do?” Chen Shuangshuang said. She was hot-tempered, and she immediately lashed out at Shen Bo.

She had been accepted as a disciple of the Heavenly Saint Palace back then, so her talent naturally wasn’t lacking. After cultivating for an epoch, she had also reached the Ninth Heaven, giving her the right to oppose Shen Bo.

Boom!

The two elites became locked in an intense battle, and the surrounding crowd naturally had no option but to scamper. Otherwise, if they were accidentally hit by a wayward shock wave, they would truly suffer a miserable fate.

Meanwhile, Ling Jianxue seized this opportunity to rush up to Ling Feifan, asking, “Feifan, are you okay?”

“Dad, I’m fine,” Ling Feifan replied.

Only at this moment did Ling Jianxue look toward Ling Han. A sense of familiarity involuntarily welled up in his heart, yet he was unable to immediately put his finger on the reason. Moreover, this was the Promise City Realm, so how could he be familiar with anyone here?
