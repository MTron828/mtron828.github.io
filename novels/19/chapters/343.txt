Chapter 344: Little Overlord Spear

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han’s physique was extremely strong—having formed the Rock Cliff Body, his body was like a rock, difficult to harm by sharp weapons. However, the main power from Yang Chong’s attack came from the shock, as if it were shocking his entire body into pieces.

For example, a sword slashed on a rock might only burst out a bunch of sparks, and while the rock stayed unharmed, the blade’s edge instead would get bent. However, if a hammer was used to smash it? Then it was very likely to smash the rock into a pile of rubbles.

That was the case now. A wound immediately appeared on Ling Han’s hand, and his entire right arm turned fully red; it was the blood that soaked through his clothes.

Ling Han grimaced. He was a bit conceited, assuming that when he formed Rock Cliff Body, he could look down on people of the same tier. This attack truly taught him a great lesson. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He reached out with his left hand and grabbed at the spear’s tip.

“Audacious!” Yang Chong snorted. His nickname was Little Overlord Spear; who could seize his spear?

He thrust the spear hard. Pu, pu, pu, pu, six flashes of Spear Qi were generated and turned into six silver spearheads that thrust at Ling Han’s shoulder, throat, chest, and face.

Ling Han smiled slightly—would he suffer a second time?

Fist Qi burst forth, and six silver-colored fists appeared, firing towards the Spear Qi.

Peng, peng, peng, peng , muffled sounds reverberated as the spearheads and silver fists clashed. It was clearly visible that the spearheads were completely annihilated but the silver-colored fists had some energy left, continuing to travel for a distance before being extinguished by the gust brought about by the long spear.

Hiss!

Everyone was shocked. What was Qi? It was power and martial intent combined; without corresponding martial arts comprehension, Qi wouldn’t be strong. With only martial arts comprehension and no power, Qi also wouldn’t be strong.

Thus, the collision of Qi was the most simple and unadorned impact that couldn’t be faked; it was a collision of hard power.

Ling Han’s Qi forcibly suppressed Yang Chong’s Spear Qi; what did this prove?

Kickass!

“What’s more surprising is that the spear set off Yang Chong’s Spear Qi—that spear is a Spirit Tool, right?—yet Han Ling’s punch, which was set off completely unarmed, could suppress the Spear Qi fired by it, proving that Han Ling’s martial intent is far above Yang Chong’s!”

Someone saw what was even deeper. There was no doubt since they were the elites amongst the younger generation in the Winter Moon Sect, and had a discerning eye.

“This freak!”

“He’s only nineteen, wait till he reaches twenty nine years old—what heights would he reach?”

“He probably might be recruited by a large force in middle state like Zhu Xuan Er was?”

“Pah, he improved relying on medicinal pills anyways.”

The majority was surprised, but some were disdainful, thinking that everything Ling Han achieved was because of medicinal pills; if they could also receive fostering by endless medicinal pills, they would definitely be stronger than Ling Han.

These people were obviously envious.

Ling Han grabbed the spear tip; the Rock Cliff Body, on top of Origin Power, guarded his hand, and vein-like lines spread out, radiating brightly.

Yang Chong pulled his spear, but discovered that his spear was as if it were rooted in Ling Han’s hand, completely immobile. A baleful look surfaced in his eyes; he stopped pulling, and simply poured all his force on the spear, pressing towards Ling Han.

He didn’t believe that, under such a thrust, Ling Han could still be as if nothing had happened while holding the spear with his bare palms.

One had to know that his spear was a Fourth Tier Spirit Tool!

Ling Han snorted and shook his right arm, forcibly pushing the spear aside. Yang Chong was pouring all his strength in, so when the strength resisting him disappeared, he instantly fell forward uncontrollably.

Ling Han raised his right fist and left it straight up, placing it on the track where Yang Chong was charging.

Yang Chong’s expression changed drastically. If he rammed into it, it would be seen as him ramming his face into Ling Han’s fist. However, he had just used his full strength to thrust forward, so how could he be able to stop this momentum?

Teng, teng, teng, with quick steps, he rammed into Ling Han’s fist.

From everyone else’s perspective, this scene was extremely strange... Ling Han raised his fist long ago, and Yang Chong was as if he were possessed, ramming into it with his face of his own accord; moreover, it was done with all his might.

As the cheek and the fist were about to close contact, everyone closed their eyes, unable to look... this was an obvious tragedy.

Yang Chong’s face was twisted. He didn’t want to, but he really couldn’t stop!

Peng!

His face rammed heavily into Ling Han’s fist, and under the forceful impact, he instantly spun rapidly towards one side, almost breaking his neck.

Fortunately, with this external force, he was instead able to control his body now. He hurriedly stepped downwards with his feet, forcibly halting the momentum.

But how could a face compare to a fist? Not to mention Ling Han’s fist was refined by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, as hard as a rock. The result of this head-on exchange was that the right side of his cheek bulged greatly, making him look like a pig’s head.

One side was like a pig’s head, and the other side was completely normal. Seeing such an intense contrast, people couldn’t help but laugh, and a quite a few people burst into laughter.

Ling Han also laughed. “Junior Brother Yang is so bold and fierce, actually using your face to attack my fist. My respects, my respects! Could Junior Brother Yang be planning on abandoning the spear and cultivating the legendary iron-faced art?”

Being teased like this, Yang Chong was naturally fuming with anger, but no matter how one saw it, it looked like he used his face to ram Ling Han’s fist. Ling Han stood completely still and he was the one who approached it on his own accord.

‘Damn it, this damned bastard!’

Yang Chong pulled himself together, brandished the silver spear, and said, “The outcome hasn’t been decided, don’t you get happy too soon.”

“Hmm, you can justify and speak with such reason while looking like a pig head, Junior Brother Yang’s legendary iron-faced art is already somewhat successful.” Ling Han continued to mock.

“Damn it!” Yang Chong couldn’t bear it anymore. He swept the long spear, charging in a frenzy at Ling Han with the same old trick.

Ling Han suffered once and wouldn’t receive it head-on again unless he formed Iron Sheet Body. With a body like a metal chunk, he probably wouldn’t fear such a head-on exchange. He laughed loudly and said, “In three moves, I’ll make you kneel and sing the conquer song!”

“Bullsh!t!” Yang Chong gained knowledge through pain; he wouldn’t give Ling Han the chance to grab his spear as he brandished the long spear in circles smoothly and quickly.

Ling Han dove right in. Under the Eye of Truth, would moves at a mere seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier have no flaws? He charged in front of Yang Chong from an inconceivable route, fired a punch, and said, “A spear’s advantage is in its long-ranged attacks and the immense power from sweeps, but at close range, a long spear has not much use and is only a burden!”

Yang Chong clenched his teeth, and made his left hand available to fend off Ling Han’s fist.

Peng!

He immediately staggered and retreated. However, he was smart, thinking to take advantage of this backward momentum to increase the distance between him and Ling Han before organizing a counterattack. However, how could he use such a small trick in front of Ling Han?

Ling Han followed him like one’s own shadow. Peng, peng, peng, he threw two consecutive punches and sent Yang Chong flying.

As expected, he only used three moves.
