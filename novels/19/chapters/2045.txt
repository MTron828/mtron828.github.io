Chapter 2046: The golden dragon bridge lights up again

The Empress stepped out. Her purple long skirt stuck close to her figure as it fluttered in the slight breeze, putting the perfect outline of her figure on full display.

Involuntarily, this made a great many people feel carefree and relaxed, unable to remove their eyes from her.

Weng, weng, weng.?The dragon bridges lit up one after another, and in an instant, their number exceeded five.

“This is at least an emperor tier!”

“Hehe, when I go to choose my dragon bridge later, if I can walk the same path as her, I will definitely court this exquisite beauty!”

“You had best save the effort. You are not even a king tier, so what right do you have to court her?”

“Is an emperor tier definitely strong? My cultivation level is peak stage Heaven Soul, and the majority of emperor tiers would not be my match.”

The Empress’s exquisiteness had caused a massive commotion. Though Hu Niu’s beauty was not inferior to hers, the Empress’s grace and bearing were as unique as a rare gem.

Weng, the sixth and the seventh dragon bridge lit up in quick succession.

Now, the noise of chatter from the masses instantly silenced. Seven dragon bridges lighting up meant that this exquisite beauty was a monarch tier!

Any place that could nurture a monarch tier had to be of the Celestial King Tier, and that had to be a high-level Celestial King Tier at that.

How could the descendant that had walked out from this kind of force be slighted?

In quick succession, the eighth dragon bridge lit up.

The crowds exploded in uproar.

Eight dragon bridges lighting up at the same time, what did that signify?

She could possibly attempt nine bridges, and then would be able to stimulate a golden dragon bridge!

Heavens, could it be that a sixth supreme monarch tier was going to appear? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Four monarch tiers appearing at the same time meant that it was possible an Eighth heaven Celestial King would emerge. Then, if this was the situation, did it mean that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was going to appear now?

Ninth Heaven Celestial King, the strongest in the world!

Everyone inhaled sharply at the same time, stunned to the point of speechlessness. The Hundred Dragons Tournament Battles this time round would definitely be the start of a new era.

Weng, true enough, the ninth dragon bridge lit up!

Suddenly, the nine dragon bridges all dimmed, and a golden dragon bridge lit up.

“Heavens, what have I seen!”

“Another prodigy that can stimulate a golden dragon bridge!”

“What kind of prosperous age of cultivation is going to begin here?”

“No, no, no. We have never seen these two women before. They must not be from our Universal Peace Heaven. If monarch tiers were gathered from all the Heavenly Realms, it would be very normal for six super monarch tiers to appear.”

“But however you put it, for six monarch tiers to appear at the same time, it is possible that a Ninth Heaven Celestial King will emerge from among them!”

“Ninth Heaven Celestial King!”

“Ninth Heaven Celestial King!”

“Ninth Heaven Celestial King!”

Finally, the only words that were left being murmured by the mouths of the masses were Ninth Heaven Celestial King. In the eyes of ordinary Celestials, Ninth Heaven Celestial King was an existence that stood at the pinnacle of the Celestial Path, on the same level as the heavens, supreme and noble.

And they had personally witnessed the rise of a future ruler. This naturally caused them to feel their heads numb and feel extremely excited.

“Who would it be?”

“Tian Qingyue?”

“Xia Houtong?”

“Zhu Huiyun?”

“That little girl munching on a chicken drumstick?”

When they thought of Hu Niu, the masses all shook their heads repeatedly. As they saw it, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had to be incredibly austere. What Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be munching on a chicken drumstick, and act so casual?

The Empress smiled dazzlingly at Ling Han, and then stepped onto her bridge.

She was never a delicate flower that needed to depend on the protection of another, but rather the all-powerful great Empress!

Ling Han mused ruefully in his heart. If you loved someone, you should not protect her completely, but had to give her space, and allow her to fly as she willed.

Bewitching Maiden Rou also stepped out. With a sway of her slender waist, she arrived at the edge of the cliff. That alluring grace instantly caused a few people to feel like their eyes were going to pop out.

How could there be such a devastatingly seductive woman?

Bewitching Maiden Rou stretched out her slender hand. She was clearly channeling her cultivation technique, yet it seemed like she was dancing elegantly. Suddenly, one after another, dragon bridges lit up, responding to her power of Regulation.

One, two, three, four, five, six!

A total of six bridges.

This meant that not only was Bewitching Maiden Rou an emperor tier, she could also be ranked in the upper echelons of emperor tiers, and was just a hair’s breadth away from advancing into the ranks of monarch tier. Unfortunately, monarch tiers had to be at the fifth severance, and this was something that she could never accomplish in this lifetime.

…Unless she severed her own cultivation level, and started back from the very beginning again, but exactly how many people would possess such determination?

Bewitching Maiden Rou also smiled beautifully, and stepped onto the bridge.

“Let me!”

“Let me!”

“Let me!”

After Bewitching Maiden Rou, countless people shoved one another in their efforts to stimulate the dragon bridges. They all dreamed of being able to pick the same dragon bridge as Bewitching Maiden Rou. In that way, they might perhaps have a chance of getting close to her.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. The commotion that Bewitching Maiden Rou had given rise to would actually be even larger than that made by the Empress and Hu Niu?

Upon further thought, this was also normal.

Though the Empress and Hu Niu were more beautiful—one was incredibly dignified, while the other was pure—if one were to talk about the matter of seducing men, it was definitely Bewitching Maiden Rou’s allure that was superior.

A Bewitching Maiden was a Bewitching Maiden after all.

Ling Han naturally would not allow the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to take risks. She had not even advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier. If she was to meet with any villains on the dragon bridge, she really would not have the slightest bit of ability to save herself.

It was naturally the same for Shi Lei and Shi Yu. They were too weak, so they had best just obediently stay inside the Black Tower.

Countless people were attempting to stimulate the dragon bridges. Actually, as long as they were cultivators, and had reached the Severing Mundane Tier in cultivation level, they would definitely be able to stimulate the dragon bridges. The only difference lay in the number. The majority could only stimulate a single one. After all, whether they were king tiers, emperor tiers, or monarch tiers, they belonged to the extremely limited category of people.

Ling Han did not wait longer, either. After Bewitching Maiden Rou, he also began to stimulate the dragon bridges.

However, what Regulations should he use?

Ling Han was slightly hesitant. Merely in terms of Source Powers of heaven and earth, he had four of them in his body, and added with the three types of power of Regulation bestowed on him by the Black Tower, this number had reached as many as seven. Additionally, he himself also had a grasp of the Regulation of Slaughter, Space, and Time, and added together, this had broken the limit of 10.

Even if it was in terms of his own grasp of the Regulation of Slaughter, Space, and Time, they were extremely powerful, though they could not be compared with the Source Powers of heaven and earth.

Then, he would just try them one by one.

The first one was Fire.

The first Source Power of heaven and earth that Ling Han had obtained was the Nine Heavens Flame, and thus he first stimulated the Nine Heavens Flame.

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul appeared.?Boom, his whole body was burning fiercely, stimulating the dragon bridges.

Weng, weng, weng.?Suddenly, the dragon bridges lit up one after another. Five, seven, eight!

This kind of great commotion was extremely astonishing, immediately drawing the eyes of a great many people. Then, they were all shocked silly.

Another prodigy that could stimulate eight bridges!

Would he be able to stimulate another?

“It should not be possible. Six supreme monarch tiers have already appeared just now, so it is impossible that another one would appear, right?”

The majority thought so. Seven super monarch tiers, just the thought of that made them numb.

Weng!

RIght at this moment, the ninth dragon bridge lit up, and then just like previously, all the dragon bridges dimmed. Then, a golden dragon bridge exuded majestic light, as if a golden dragon was about to leap out of it.

“Heavens!”

“The golden dragon bridge has lit up again!”

“It’s the seventh one by now!”

“This has broken all records in history, right?”

Everyone exclaimed in shock, and then they all became numb. Now, if there was an eighth person that could stimulate the golden dragon bridge, they would already be capable of accepting it peacefully.

Really, they could not be any more surprised than this. Their nerves were already tough enough.

…If they knew that Ling Han had stimulated the golden dragon bridge with only a divided soul, they would definitely drop onto their knees in shock.

However, Ling Han did not take a step.
