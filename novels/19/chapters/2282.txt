Chapter 2283: Class begins

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Celestial Maiden Yunhe knew her own suffering. She did not dare to make a move at all. It was as if what she was facing was not a person, but rather a ferocious primitive beast. Once she made a move, she would be facing a terrifying counter, and would lose her life in an instant.

And with her aura tightly locked down on, she did not dare even open her mouth, fearing that it, too, would result in an attack from Ling Han.

Droplets of sweat streamed down her forehead, and her whole body was completely damp. She felt incredibly weary. It was not a physical weariness, but a spiritual exhaustion. She really wanted to lie down and take a good rest, not wanting to move even a single finger.

Even if everyone could not see the storm brewing under the surface between Ling Han and Celestial Maiden Yunhe, they only had to see the layer of cold sweat on Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s forehead, and they knew that she was presently in an extremely disadvantageous position.

They were all astounded. Ling Han hadn’t even made a move, all right? Why did Celestial Maiden Yunhe look like she had just gone through a fight, and it had been an extremely difficult, great battle at that? She looked like she was close to death.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and withdrew his aura. Instantly, he became harmless again. However, with the appearance of the Demon Race, he appeared slightly eerie and frightening.

At this, no one dared to speak any further.

Even an idiot would know that Ling Han was indescribably powerful, and Celestial Maiden Yunhe was not even capable of making a move.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe breathed a sigh of relief. She finally understood that Ling Han had defeated Di Fei with a single move not because the latter was too weak, but rather because Ling Han was too strong.

This person’s strength had even surpassed the range of monarch tiers!

However, it should be known that Monarch Stars would only emerge from the Dividing Soul Tier onward, and it was the final stages of the Dividing Soul Tier at that.

How could there be Monarch Stars in the Severing Mundane Tier? A monarch tier was the strongest among them.

With both of them being monarch tiers, why was there such a huge gap between them?

she composed herself, and said, “Everyone, please board the carriage. It is time that we should set out towards the Hundred Battles Academy.”

No one spoke, and everyone merely boarded the carriage in silence. They were still in utter astonishment at how powerful Ling Han was.

This carriage of Celestial Maiden Yunhe was extremely spacious. There was absolutely no problem even if over a dozen people boarded it together. Everyone sat down on the seats, appearing very reserved. From a certain aspect, this was also Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s private domain.

Ling Han boarded the carriage, and with a sweep of his gaze, he strode forwards with absolutely no reservations, and planted himself on the soft couch. It was naturally this that was the most comfortable seat here.

Immediately, everyone turned to look at him, gritting their teeth and pursing their lips.

“That was Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s private couch, and you actually dared to sit on it. Isn’t this an offense to the beauty?

Ling Han did not take the expressions of the masses to heart at all. He simply switched to a more comfortable position, crossing his legs. In fact, even his shoes were touching the sheets.

Even if Celestial Maiden Yunhe had already experienced this once, she still wanted to thrash Ling Han now—this guy was really too despicable. She had made up her mind: once Ling Han disembarked from the carriage, she would immediately discard this soft couch.

However, seeing how Ling Han grabbed a towel from beside the couch to wipe himself, Celestial Maiden Yunhe almost passed out in fury. That was her personal towel. Not too long ago, she had just used it, and now Ling Han wiping himself with it was equivalent to indirect intimate contact between the

two of them, causing a murderous urge to rise up in her.

Everyone remembered the name “Ba.” They had understood by now. There was no way that they could possibly match Ling Han. They could only anticipate the big shots in the Hundred Battles Academy would make a move after they enrolled, or maybe those elites that had already advanced into the

Seventh Lotus would do so.

On the journey, everyone was especially quiet. The carriage rocked and swayed for half a year until it finally stopped, and Long Tu’s voice rang out from outside. “Master, we have reached the Hundred Battles Academy.”

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. They had finally arrived, and there was no further need for them to face Ling Han. They had really been under enormous stress.

They hurriedly alighted from the carriage, while Ling Han was the second-last to disembark. When he had gotten off the carriage, Celestial Maiden Yunhe’s irritated voice rang out. “Long Tu, discard everything that is in my carriage!”

Right, it was not just Ling Han. She had also developed a grudge against everyone else.

Long Tu did not understand, yet could only obey. How could he possibly dare to question her commands?

‘The Hundred Battles Academy was built at the foot of a mountain, with structures that stretched outward. There were a considerable number of greatly differing building styles among them, One was the style of the Demon Race, simple and crude, wild and primitive; another was the style of the Angel

Race, filled with luxury and unnecessary lavishness. Even a small house would be built with all effort and the best materials.

There were also multiple caves, eerie and frightening. Those were allocated for the Insect Race. There were also stretches of forest, with the main colors being white and gold. This was to accommodate the Holy Beasts.

Ling Han and the others entered into the academy. Celestial Maiden Yunhe made arrangements for them, so someone from the academy came out very soon, and conducted a selection process for them. Only those that had reached king tier at least would be qualified to become disciples of the Hundred

Battles Academy.

Ling Han’s heart was a little heavy because the king tiers of the Foreign Realm numbered far more than in the Celestial Realm.

With just the numbers he had seen, there were astonishingly many of them, and in the greater environment of the entire Foreign Realm, this was definitely just a drop in the ocean.

The overall level of this realm was higher than the Celestial Realm’s, so it could accommodate more prodigies and elites.

Ling Han passed very easily. He was a monarch tier, and he would definitely be treated with great regard even in the forces of an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At present, he was a member of the Demon Race, so he was naturally assigned to stay in the Demon Quarters, staying together with his “companions” who likewise had red skin, honed heads, and tails.

If Ling Han had been given the choice, he would’ve definitely chosen to stay in the Angel Quarters. They were at least easy on the eyes.

The main theme of the Demon Quarters was fighting. It was like they were all filled with endless energy. Sometimes, there would not have been any conflict at all. They merely wanted to fight because they were in a good or bad mood.

Ling Han could not care less, and simply lay down in his rooms to sleep, waiting for classes to start at the academy.

He was truly very interested in the cultivation world and history of the Foreign Realm. Also, why did the Foreign Realm have to invade the Celestial Realm? It was clear that the Celestial Realm had an inferior overall level of cultivation, so what could they do even if they succeeded in their conquest?

It was one thing for the others, but why would the Heavenly Venerable Tiers of the Foreign Realm have to move? They really could not gain any form of benefit.

“There must be something I don’t know,’ Ling Han thought. This was also the reason why he wanted to come here.

Several days later, there was information from the academy. Class would begin tomorrow, and the main lecturer was a Ninth Lotus elite.

After waiting patiently for a day, Ling Han went with a large number of his “companions” towards the plaza of the academy.

In the four directions of north, south, east, and west, each zone was clearly separated. The Demon Race was on the east side, the Angel Race on the west side, the Holy Beasts on the south side, and the Insect Race on the north side. There was definitely no one who sat randomly.

Ling Han’s gaze swept over the masses, and he was secretly astonished. The number of king tiers and emperor tiers here was really astonishing, with their majestic life essence soaring sky-high.

Previously, in the neutral zone, he had killed a great many prodigies through deception. Initially, he had thought that it would be a severe wound to the Foreign Realm, causing a vacuum to appear in the next few billion years, but from the look of things now, he had really been too optimistic.

There were over 10,000 people here, and the strongest among them was Eighth Lotus. In other words, they were Immortal Palace Tiers, but there were not many of them. It was said that the academy would ordinarily nurture their students up to the Seventh Lotus, and they would leave upon attaining the

Seventh Lotus. Only the really outstanding figures would be able to stay behind, and continue to enjoy the resources provided by the academy.

Hence, the Seventh Lotuses that appeared here were emperor tiers, at least, and those Eighth Lotuses were definitely monarch tiers.

“For the sake of survival!” An elite shot forwards, the pattern of Ninth Lotus blooming on his forehead. This was an elite of the Insect Race. He was just a giant ant, completely dark red in color, his joints like metal.

“For the sake of survival!” everyone roared as well, appearing extremely excited..
