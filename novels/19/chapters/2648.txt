2649 Miracle!

Even in this grand hall, heavenly tribulation still came and went as it pleased.

However, this palace was indeed extraordinary. Theoretically speaking, heavenly tribulation should have formed outside the palace. The first bolt of lightning would then directly destroy the palace. It was because of this that people went to desolate locations to face heavenly tribulation.

Here, however, heavenly tribulation directly appeared beneath the roof of the storey. Dark clouds gathered, amid which lightning flashed.

This was extremely strange!

Perhaps heavenly tribulation knew that it couldn’t damage this palace, so it directly appeared in this level?

This wasn’t impossible. This was because the might of heavenly tribulation also had its limits—the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven. However, Heavenly Venerates had exceeded this limit, so how could their constructions be damaged by heavenly tribulation?

Why were Heavenly Venerates detested by heaven and earth? It was naturally because they had broken the rules of heaven and earth.

At this moment, all kinds of thoughts rushed through Ling Han’s mind. However, he immediately focused his attention on the tribulation.

Crack!

The first bolt of lightning slammed down, its might reaching the middle stage of the Ninth Heaven.

Ling Han channeled the Five Elements Lightning Technique as he faced this strike, and he was unexpectedly able to manipulate the power of heavenly tribulation. Meanwhile, he also summoned his Divine Demon Sword. Following his advance in cultivation, he naturally needed to elevate the level of the Divine Demon Sword as well.

In his mind, his Celestial Seed was undergoing its seventh transformation.

Bolts of lightning continued to slam down. However, a large portion of their energy was absorbed by the Divine Demon Sword and the Five Elements Lightning Technique. Even so, heavenly tribulation at the Ninth Heaven wasn’t so easy to face. Ling Han was still riddled with wounds as he faced the remnant power from the bolts of lightning.

In comparison, his Indestructible Celestial King Physique which had only just reached the seventh level was truly a bit too weak. It seemed completely powerless against the destructive power of the Ninth Heaven.

One day later, heavenly tribulation dissipated.

Ling Han observed his own power, and a bitter smile involuntarily appeared on his face.

“This advance can be regarded as the advance where my power has increased the least!”

Because the energy of the Dimension Scroll had already been exhausted, his Body Art remained on the same level as before. His Body Art was the main source of his battle prowess, and it had already reached the pinnacle of the early stage of the Ninth Heaven. It was now approaching the middle stage.

This time, only his power of Regulations became more powerful. Even so, it had only been at the peak stage of the Eighth Heaven to begin with, and while it had now indeed advanced to the Ninth Heaven, it had only reached the early stage of the Ninth Heaven. Combined with his Body Art, Ling Han’s battle prowess had now reached the middle stage of the Ninth Heaven.

It could be said that his battle prowess had only improved by very little.

“This is also because the gulf between the Eighth Heaven and the Ninth Heaven is far too great. Combined with my Body Art, it’s as if I haven’t advanced at all.”

If he still had had a Dimension Scroll, his Body Art would have improved as well, so his battle prowess might have reached the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven. At the very least, it would have reached the late stage of the Ninth Heaven.

However!

Ling Han raised his hand, activating the Five Elements Lightning Technique. Gold, azure, black, red, and yellow intertwined together before there was a flash of white lightning that instantly transformed nine-colored divine lightning that pulsated in his palm. He could manipulate it in any form he wanted.

“Combining all five types of lightning together has led to a qualitative change. The might of a single strike can allow me to unleash destructive power at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven!

“I’ve never come across such a powerful secret technique before!

“As expected of a Heavenly Venerate Technique!

“However, with my current strength, I can only unleash nine such strikes at most. After all, this is a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and its might is far too extreme!

“If I can obtain all nine scrolls of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, and if I can channel each individually, I’ll be able to maintain my explosive strength for longer.

“Shame, I still need six more scrolls.

“Instead of moping around here, I might as well test out Wally’s models. I’ll see if I can directly extract the six fundamental powers!”

Ling Han immediately stopped moping around, and started to mull over how he could resolve this problem.

In any case, the Empress was still cultivating in seclusion, so he had much time on his hands.

Ling Han started to channel Wally’s model. He had initially used this “cultivation technique” to absorb power from the Dimension Scroll, but he was now using it on the entire heaven and earth.

In fact, Ling Han had already attempted this before in the Celestial Realm. However, he hadn’t succeeded at the time.

However, Ling Han hadn’t been a Celestial King at that time, either, and the Celestial Realm was more so a super low-level dimension. Meanwhile, this place was a transcendent dimension. The difference between the two was immense, so it was worth another try.

Ling Han sat down cross-legged. He didn’t enter the Celestial Guest Residence this time, as the barrier of Divine Metal would affect his communication with heaven and earth.

He sat as still as a boulder, not forgetting to also accelerate time. As for enemies finding him, he didn’t worry about this at all. With his current strength, he could leave with composure and ease even if he came across a Ninth Heaven Celestial King at the peak stage.

In fact, if Ling Han suddenly unleashed the Five Elements Lightning Technique, it was possible that those at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven might even die by his hands.

10 years, 100 years, 700 years… Ling Han was still unable to sense the fundamental power of the Genesis World.

This was very normal. After all, only Heavenly Venerates could sense, grasp, and channel the six fundamental powers. Moreover, this was only Heavenly Venerates above the First Tier. This was because First Tier Heavenly Venerates could only use the unique power of each dimension. In some sense, they could be regarded as Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han was only at the Seventh Heaven, yet he wanted to ascend the heavens with a single stride?

However, Ling Han was no fool, and he naturally had his own reason for doing this—he had once absorbed Void Particle Energy before, and he also had the model that had taken Wally countless years to create. Wally was more so the culmination of hundreds of epochs of knowledge.

With this in mind, maybe, perhaps, Ling Han would have a sliver of a chance. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han became increasingly calm and relaxed as his mind entered a state of wandering around the outside world.

A minute particle suddenly rushed into his body. In terms of size, this particle was as small as could be. In terms of quality, however, what this particle possessed was utterly terrifying. This infinitesimally small particle possessed the power to obliterate heaven and earth.

Pa!

The particle suddenly burst apart, transforming into a storm of violent energy that coursed through Ling Han’s body.

“Wah!”

Ling Han shuddered violently before vomiting a mouthful of blood. He felt as if two-thirds of his bones had been instantly broken. In fact, he had almost been killed.

‘This is… Void Particle Energy!’

That particle had been none other than a Void Particle. He had absorbed a single one, yet the energy contained within it had been far too terrifying. The explosion of that particle that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye had almost killed Ling Han.

One had to realize that he was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King whose battle prowess could reach the middle stage of the Ninth Heaven, yet he was almost unable to withstand this strike!

However, Ling Han wasn’t afraid. Instead, he was absolutely ecstatic.

He had attracted a Void Particle!

If he told others about this, they definitely wouldn’t believe him. Even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t draw on the six fundamental powers, so how could Ling Han, a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, do so?

“Cough, cough!” Ling Han roared with laughter as blood continued to drip from his mouth.

He hurriedly channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to heal his wounds. He then guided the chaotic energy inside his body, using it to temper himself.

Right now, he was still unable to directly absorb Void Particle Energy. Instead, he could only use this method of tempering to strengthen his Body Art. Doing so was like taking a huge detour, but being able to manipulate this Heavenly Venerable Tier power while at the Celestial King Tier was definitely worth it. In fact, it would be worth it even if things were 100 times more difficult.

“I’m still too weak, so I needed 1000 years to attract a single Void Particle.

“The Dimension Scroll was much better. Not only could I extract its energy at any time, but its power was also gentle and not chaotic like this ‘wild’ particle.”

Ling Han shook his head as he muttered this complaint. He then started to cultivate again.
