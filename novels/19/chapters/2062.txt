Chapter 2063: Battling Tian Qingyue

Boom, a blazing light surged past, and a massive turbulence appeared in the Regulations of heaven and earth.

This was the Great Clash of Source Powers. Aside from Regulations of Earth, the other four types of Regulations were all intensely clashing; the might that was created from this explosion was incredibly frightening, and also affected the Dao of Heaven and Earth in the surroundings.

Sikong Hao?

He had already disappeared, his form and spirit both destroyed in this blow.

A great Heaven Soul king tier, and he actually couldn’t withstand a single blow from a Yang Soul!

Who could believe that?

The iron rules of cultivation had determined that Sikong Hao would have been able to kill Ling Han in two to three moves, but now the tables were turned. This was extremely inconceivable.

How could there be such a powerful Yang Soul?

Tian Qingyue’s gaze immediately turned harsh, and was covered with a layer of haze.

Just now, the fact that Ling Han’s performance had been slightly inferior to Sikong Hao’s had already made him feel that Ling Han’s strength had caught up to his from when he had been at this stage, which also mean that if Ling Han’s cultivation level was presently also Heaven Soul, the two of them would be equals. Of course, Tian Qingyue definitely had strong confidence in himself, and thought that he would still be capable of being slightly superior.

But Ling Han actually killed Sikong Hao with a single bow, which was enough to match Tian Qingyue’s present strength. This had also shattered his self-confidence.

He did not think that he would have been able to do so when he had been a Yang Soul himself.

He could not do this, but Ling Han could. So wasn’t this difference obvious enough?

He was actually inferior to Ling Han, inferior to a guy that he had previously looked down on. He looked down on Ling Han, so wouldn’t he have been disdaining himself even more?

“H-how dare you!” Behind Tian Qingyue, a follower came back out of his shock, and immediately shouted at Ling Han, pointing a finger at him.

Not only was he a Heaven Soul, he was also an emperor tier.

If he was being honest, he was definitely no match for Ling Han’s previous explosive attack, but even if he had taken on this attack head-on, he would only have sustained minor injury. It was definitely impossible that he would have been killed. Thus, he had enough confidence to rebuke Ling Han. As long as he could block a few blows from Ling Han, Tian Qingyue naturally would stand up for him.

“Sikong was only sparring with you, yet you dealt him a deadly attack. That is too cruel!” he continued.

“Oh?” Ling Han shook his head. At the beginning, Sikong Hao had indeed merely wanted to humiliate him, but by the second move, he had already shown his killing intent, so how could this possibly still be a spar?

‘You guys want to kick me around, and distort the truth deliberately?’

“I have killed him anyways, so what about it?” Ling Han’s tone was very forceful. Since you guys were being so overbearing, there was no reason for him to step back, either.

“A person who kills… needs to pay with his life!” that follower declared menacingly.

“Pay with your life!” the other followers similarly called out loudly.

Tian Qingyue did not speak, but his gaze was very harsh as killing intent surged from him.

If Ling Han’s battle prowess was only like what it had been at the start, then he would disdain from dealing with Ling Han with how proud he was. That was because it was definitely he that would win in a battle of equal cultivation levels. But now that he had witnessed Ling Han’s true battle prowess, Tian Qingyue was not as confident in himself as he had once been.

In a battle of equal cultivation levels… he would definitely lose!

To say nothing of equal cultivation levels, Ling Han only had to advance into Yin Soul, and he would probably be able to suppress Tian Qingyue.

This caused Tain Qingyue’s killing intent to blaze madly. As an invincible monarch tier, it was enough that he could not overcome a gap in cultivation level and suppress his superior opponent, and he actually would be the one being suppressed by a weaker opponent. Furthermore, there was a total gap of two minor levels. This was completely unacceptable.

Could it be that he was only an ordinary cultivator, and Ling Han was an invincible monarch tier?

…This was really him overthinking things.

That was because Ling Han had used the Great Clash of Source Powers. The might would increase accordingly as his cultivation level increased, but it was mainly still restricted to the major tier he was in. The change in battle prowess brought about by a minor level was not very apparent. Thus, even if Ling Han advanced into Yin Soul, he would still be unable to suppress Tian Qingyue easily. Even if he was an Earth Soul, he could not do so. Only after he himself had reached Heaven Soul would he be able to.

“No one can kill my people, and leave completely without a look back!” Tian Qingyue spoke up. “You commit suicide. At least you will be able to ensure your corpse is whole.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Han laughed loudly. “I have just killed a dog that only knows to bark madly. What’s the big deal?”

“You are only seeking your own death like this!” Tian Qingyue humphed, and in a flash, he already appeared in front of Ling Han. Stretching out his hand, his five fingers grabbed out at Ling Han’s throat.

He was a Heaven Soul monarch tier. This grab was both quick and ruthless, with frightening power of Regulation surging in his strike. Even an emperor tier at Heaven Soul would be instantly suppressed by this kind of Regulations, being completely destroyed and corrupted.

Ling Han did not hesitate the slightest. With his soft exclamation, the Great Clash of Source Powers was activated, and a terrifying storm of energy exploded from his chest.

Tian Qingyue had clearly witnessed how terrifying the Great Clash of Source Powers could be, yet did not look like he was going to retreat in the slightest. His right hand was still in its original position, tackling the Great Clash of Source Powers head-on.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The power of Regulation surged out madly, turning into multiple astonishing seals that glowed and dimmed, and were incredibly bright in their brilliance.

Ling Han and Tian Qingyue were both sent several hundred meters back, but in the next instant, they both charged back, and an intense exchange of blows unfolded.

The heaven and earth were forcibly ripped, showing multiple tears in space. It was like the whole world had become inky black, but every time the two great monarch tiers clashed, an incredibly brilliant light would surge out, lighting up the whole universe.

Everyone was completely stunned and dazzled by the scene. Had this kind of battle really exploded between two Dividing Soul Tiers?

It was probable… that even the power of Immortal Palace Tier was only like this as well.

Those eight followers of Tian Qingyue felt their scalps grow numb. Their mouths gaped widely, but they could not spit out a single word.

This was too stunning. That guy that was fighting on equal terms with Tian Qingyue was only a mere Yang Soul!

For a Yang Soul to be able to match a Heaven Soul, this was already something that came out of fantasies, and only those very rare super monarch tiers like Tian Qingyue and Xia Houtong would be able to do so. But the person that Ling Han was fighting was no ordinary Heavenly Emperor, but a supreme monarch tier like Tian Qingyue.

Monster, he was such a freak!

The two great monarch tiers battled fiercely. Their figures flashed, and even an ordinary Heaven Soul would feel their eyes blur and an urge to vomit arise upon seeing this kind of battle.

Pa, pa, pa,?blood splattered. There was Ling Han’s blood, and there was also Tian Qingyue’s.

The eight great followers were all astounded. Tian Qingyue had actually sustained injury. This arrogant super monarch tier actually would get injured as well!

After exchanging several hundred blows, the two great monarch tiers stepped to the side, and were separated by about 60 meters. They faced each other, but made no further move.

Tian Qingyue did not make a move, because now he was more familiar with Ling Han than others. This man’s physique was practically tough to a chilling extent. Even after sustaining several hundred blows from him, Ling Han had only bled a little. But in Tian Qingyue’s case? Though he had not sustained as many blows as Ling Han had, his physique was far from being a match for the other party’s, and the injuries he had actually suffered were actually no lighter than what Ling Han had sustained.

If they continued the battle, it was possible that he would lose, or even possibly die!

This was naturally something that he would definitely not do.

And the reason why Ling Han had not made a move was because the exertion of his Origin Power and spirit was very great, and he could no longer channel the Great Clash of Source Powers.

Thus, they only faced each other.

“Lord Tian actually can’t do anything to this guy!”

“He is just a mere Yang Soul!”

“Heavens, how could there be such a freak?”

“I am about to go crazy!”

The eight followers were all exclaiming in shock while grabbing their heads, filled with absolute disbelief.

“I will spare your life this once, and will definitely demand it in future!” Tian Qingyue declared menacingly.

“Ha!” Ling Han scoffed. “In a battle of equal cultivation levels, it would be a piece of cake for me to kill you!”

Tian Qingyue’s aura had weakened, and this was an incredibly striking reality. The space for Ling Han’s growth was far superior to his. However, in the blink of an eye, his killing intent blazed again. This kind of terrifying opponent really had to be killed as soon as possible, or there could possibly be no chance to do so in future.

And right at this moment, a group of people were walking over to the canyon, and the person in the lead was a captivatingly exquisite and graceful beauty.
