Chapter 1757: A Yang Soul elite arrives

The Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts was really too terrifying.

If a treasure could also be divided into a flawless severance and normal severance, then the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts was definitely a flawless severance, and had furthermore attained a flawless severance through striking the heaven and earth!

It definitely could overwhelm all elites of the same level. Otherwise, the Ding Clan would have been too foolish to pay such a great price to refine it.

Thus, when the ghostly mist appeared, the grand elders of both the Duan and Long Clan could only evade, and Ling Han and the Empress used Lightning Flash, similarly leaving the territory that was enshrouded by the ghostly mist.

The fierce ghosts wailed shrilly, rolling about in the black mist. Those eerie screams caused a considerable effect on Ling Han and the others, causing them to bleed from their seven apertures and also look similar to a ghost.

What a frightening treasured Tool!

The only one who was unaffected was Ding Yaolong. He was the user of the treasured Tool, so he was naturally immune to its effects. As for the large black dog, he had really run away too far, so he was unaffected as well.

Ling Han’s physique was strong, and his spirit had also been tempered by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Though he was bleeding from his seven apertures, he could still hold on. The Empress had nine doppelgangers; in this half a year’s time, she had already destroyed a few, which she had later formed again, so the attack that she sustained could be divided equally among all 10 of them, so she could bear it as well.

After all, this was only a portion of the full might of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts.

The grand elders Duan and Long were still fine. Their cultivation level was still strong, and it would be too difficult for mere sound waves to inflict injury on them.

Thus, though the four of them looked very pitiful, they were completely capable of holding on.

“Take down the ringleader first!” the grand elders of the Duan and Long Clans exclaimed softly, and charged towards Ding Yaolong. They could not continue being a submissive target like this, after all.

But Ding Yaolong did not even move at all, and only summoned the black mist towards him so that it surrounded him. In this manner, if the two grand elders of the Duan and Long Clan were to attack him forcibly, they would be trapped by the black mist, and that would definitely be big trouble.

“You two old bastards, I had planned to kill the two of you after a few hundred million years passed, but since I have already exposed the secret of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts today, I will take this chance to slaughter all of you!” Ding Yaolong declared coldly.

The grand elders of the Duan and Long Clan were both marveling at their luck in secret. They had not imagined that the Ding Clan would actually refine such an evil treasured Tool, and more importantly, they had actually refined it successfully.

It should be known that the heaven and earth would bestow a punishment to erase the person who had refined this kind of evil weapon, but looking at the situation now, there seemed to be a mysterious force that was suppressing the evil of this Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts.

It was still missing a slight bit, and had yet to reach the requirement for drawing a divine punishment onto it. Thus, though the thunderclouds had formed, the divine punishment had still not descended all this while.

If Ding Yaolong had taken this Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts when they had completely no expectation of it, they definitely would’ve been finished!

Thankfully, they knew about it now. If they knew about it, it would be fine. This was only a Pseudo-Celestial Tool that was equivalent to the fourth severance, after all.

Ding Yaolong battled two great first severance grand elders on his own, but not only did he force the two great grand elders into dodging and evading in a tizzy, he could still spare a hand to launch attacks at Ling Han and the Empress. The person he most wanted to kill was still Ling Han.

If Ling Han was allowed to flee this time, the Ding Clan would definitely be done for.

This brat had to die! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han and the Empress continued to channel and use Lightning Flash continuously. After advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, both their power and grasp of Regulations had improved many folds over. Thus, they would not be tired after using Lightning Flash a few times.

They did not retreat, because Ling Han wanted to know just how powerful this evil weapon was so he could decide when he would come charging back the next time.

When he next came to the Ding Clan Manor, he would definitely not flee any longer. Instead, he would destroy the Ding Clan entirely.

“Grand Elder!” Just at this moment, a voice shouted out, filled with fury.

Ding Song.

Previously, he had headed to the Han Clan, and had just made his way back. The first thing he saw was that the ancestral shrine had again been ripped apart, so his fury was naturally out of bounds. He immediately spotted Ling Han, and his eyes narrowed. He instinctively thought that all this was caused by Ling Han.

He really had not guessed wrongly.

“This person is Ling Han?” There was another person next to Ding Song, dressed completely in black. There were multiple patterns that looked like spiders on his clothing, causing one to subconsciously feel disgust upon seeing them.

This was a man who looked to be in his forties. There were actually patterns on his face as well, stretching all the way to his neck, and it was probable that he had them on his chest, though they were not visible at this moment.

He looked longer at the Empress’s face, and an incredibly stunned expression involuntarily appeared on his face. A strong change took place in his gaze.

“In reply to Milord, that despicable brat is Ling Han!” Ding Song hurriedly replied with utter respect.

This blad-clad man’s name was Han Hongfei, and he was a Yang Soul grand elder of the Han Clan.

Dividing Soul Tier was divided into the four cultivation levels of Heaven Soul, Earth Soul, Yin Soul, and Yang Soul. Though Yang Soul was only the first level, the gap between Severing Mundane Tier and Dividing Soul Tier was similar to the gap between Genesis Tier and Severing Mundane Tier. No matter how prodigious you were, there was no way to possibly compensate for this gap.

Han Hongfei reluctantly withdrew his gaze from the Empress’s face. Then, he looked at Ling Han, and calmly stated, “You may commit suicide, and as for that girl, come here.”

He was completely issuing a command.

This was natural; he was a Yang Soul elite, and who could be an equal match for him here?

The grand elder of Duan Clan could not help but point out, “Milord, this is Dark Moon City!”

Dark Moon City was under the administration of the Black Moon Sect, and above the Black Moon Sect was the Fu Clan. No matter how one looked at it, it was not up to the Han Clan to show off their military might here.

“Are you threatening me?” Han Hongfei swept a cold look over the grand elder of the Duan Clan. The aura at the level of Yang Soul rippled out, as if the heavens itself was collapsing.

The grand elder of the Duan Clan suddenly spat out blood. The difference between their cultivation levels was too huge. He could not even hold up against one look or the release of his aura.

The grand elder of the Long Clan gripped his hands into tightly clenched fists, yet only dared to keep his fury in his heart. Facing the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, he could still parry and dodge, but against a Yang Soul elite, he would be dead with a single gesture of his hand.

“Milord, I cannot apprehend this boy, so please help me!” Ding Yaolong put the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts away. Since someone from the Han Clan had come, who was further a Yang Soul elite, Ling Han would definitely be dead, and there was no further need for him to make any more moves.

Han Hongfei only acted as if he had not heard him. Why would he need to give a mere fourth severance any regard? Without entering into Dividing Soul Tier, fourth severance was mere trash. He cast another look at Ling Han and the Empress, and a hint of impatience showed in his expression. “What are you still standing around for?”

“Old bastard, has your head been kicked by a mule?” Ling Han couldn’t help but throw insults. “If you want to die, then you can go and die on your own! Get f******* lost!”

‘Holy f*ck!’

Han Hongfei was involuntarily stunned, and then flew into a thunderous rage. A first severance junior actually dared point his finger at him and insult him straight to his face? He humphed, and immediately stretched out a hand to grab at Ling Han.

Hong, Origin Power, broad and powerful, spread out. This was the strike of a Dividing Soul Tier, so how could anything from a Severing Mundane Tier compare? Even a fourth severance was far inferior.

“Old bastard, you are only drawing trouble for the Han Clan. I will eventually go to the Han Clan and seek you out for an accounting!” Ling Han threw down these words, grabbed the Empress, and entered into the Black Tower, “Ultimate Invincible Escape.”

Xiu, the two of them immediately vanished.

Hong, long, long, Han Hongfei’s palm strike descended and completely missed its target, yet the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan that was initially only half-destroyed completely crumbled under this strike.

This was a Dividing Soul Tier elite’s attack!

Ding Yaolong’s mouth twitched, and he felt like the ancestors of all the previous generations would probably be climbing out of their graves to find and punish him.
