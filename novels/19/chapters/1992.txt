Chapter 1993: Ji Wuming has arrived

The two of them were battle maniacs, and now they had formed a friendship through their battle. However, Yi was definitely not the kind to be very cordial. After waving a hand at Ling Han, he sat down at one side, as if he was a fossilized rock.

Though he had become quiet, not one person dared to come near him, fearing that he would go berserk again.

Meanwhile, Ling Han returned to Hu Niu and the others, and said, “What the heck is the Twin Eyes World Destruction?”

“In legends, in times of chaos, a person born with golden and silver eyes would appear, his left hand controlling Space, while his right grasped Time. He would either bring order out of the chaos, or would completely bury this chaotic world,” Hu Niu explained.

Ling Han was astonished, and asked, “Which also means that this kind of person is born capable of controlling the power of Time and Space?”

“That should be the case.” Hu Niu nodded, but then spread out her hands. “Niu isn’t very sure, either. They all pop out of nowhere for no reason, which makes Niu very troubled.”

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou looked enviously at Hu Niu. That was an inherited memory!

One who possessed the memories of an Ascending Origin Tier or even Celestial King, which meant possessing the supreme brand of a great elite, would practically be soaring through the cultivation levels. There basically would not be any kind of barrier appearing.

What was even better was that one could enjoy the comprehension of cultivation of a great elite, yet he himself could maintain his own individuality and a complete personality. This was the best thing about it.

Some people had gained a fateful encounter, and obtained the memories left behind by a great elite, which would include the brand of cultivation, but it would also have the lifetime experiences of that great elite. Then, when the endless experiences surged over you, it could very easily make you confused and incapable of distinguishing whom this memory belonged to.

Then a great change in temperament could possibly occur.

Ling Han glanced at Yi again. Previously, when they had been fighting intensely, he had not used the two Regulations of Time and Space.

Obviously, the previous Yi had not been in his strongest battle mode.

A smile quirked up the corners of Ling Han’s lips. He, too, had not used his full power, and had not revealed any of his trump cards.

He hoped that they would battle again soon. Furthermore, it had to be a full-power battle when they could both battle to their hearts’ content.

On the other side, Ma Tongguang’s eyes were staring fixatedly, his legs shaking.

At first, he had wanted to find a chance to kill Ling Han after entering into the Yang Soul Ocean, but after witnessing the battle between Ling Han and Yi, he naturally dismissed this idea.

Who would be killing whom?

To say nothing of the fact that Ling Han and Hu Niu and the Empress might not separate, but even if they did, would he be any match for Ling Han?

That would only be suicidal!

He couldn’t help but feel despondent, and even his expression had become lifeless.

Just think, he was a cultivator of both alchemy and cultivation, excelling in both. Even in the Western Celestial Realm which was filled with talented people, there were not many that could be his equals, but when he came to the Eastern Celestial Realm, it seemed like the first person he met had already surpassed him.

Ling Han’s strength in cultivation was stronger, and in terms of alchemy, he had not become a Four-Star Alchemist, but was already respectfully addressed as grandmaster, which was proof of his natural talent in alchemy.

This made Ma Tongguang very crestfallen, and his killing intent also overflowed.

Without getting rid of Ling Han, he would not be able to rest or eat in peace.

Even if he couldn’t get rid of him now, it was fine. He could kill him after returning to the Western Celestial Realm. That would be his territory.

What? The strongest monarch tier had such power that even a Heaven Soul might not be able to kill him? That was fine. There was no lack of the Immortal Palace Tier and Ascending Origin Tier elites in the Western Celestial Realm. He only had to offer a high enough reward, and it was guaranteed that there would be someone willing to kill Ling Han for him.

Tolerate. Now, he could only wait for the Yang Soul Ocean to open, and after breaking through to Yang Soul, he would be able to return to the Western Celestial Realm. By then, Ling Han would fall straight into his hands.

‘Let’s see if I won’t get you killed.’

Ling Han swept an eye over him from afar, sneering internally. It looked like he should deal with this person to prevent him from scrambling around in front of him and causing trouble.

‘Hmm?’

Suddenly, he experienced a feeling of extreme discomfort, and turned to look in a specific direction.

Simultaneously, the Empress and Hu Niu also stood up at practically the same time, and on the other side, Yi suddenly snapped his eyes open. A streak of golden light and silver light shot out, as if they could reach the ends of the Celestial Realm.

“My Lord!” Shu Yarong leaped out, falling into a half-kneeling position, incredibly respectful.

A man in fluttering white robes appeared, his demeanor incredibly carefree, as if he was untouched by mortal affairs.

Ji Wuming!

Ling Han’s eyes narrowed slightly. The present Ji Wuming was considerably stronger than he had once been again, and Ling Han was completely incapable of estimating his strength.

Yi’s strength was flamboyant, like a fiery flame wanting to incinerate the heavens and earth, but Ji Wuming was more reserved. Upon first glance, there was nothing special about him, but if one took a longer look, one would be able to increasingly sense how terrifying the other party was.

Ji Wuming was like a massive ocean that had unfathomable depths. No one knew just how strong he was, or to what extent.

Ji Wuming smiled slightly at Shu Yarong, and raised his hand slightly. Only then did Shu Yarong stand up, and she stood respectfully behind him, as if she was a female attendant.

No, to be more accurate, she was more like his guard, just like how a soldier would guard her general.

But a noble Celestial King would actually become a guard?

What battle would need so many Celestial Kings to appear on the scene, and even a Seventh Heaven Celestial King was only worthy of becoming a soldier?

Ji Wuming’s eyes glanced over. First, his eyes paused longer on Ling Han, and then he spotted Yi. Especially when he discovered Yi’s golden and slver eyes, his lips parted slightly, showing a hint of a smile.

He was just like a hunter who had spotted prey.

Ling Han possessed a treasure he needed, and Yi had the bloodline he needed.

These two people... he was going to take both of them for his own!

“You looking at me like this make me very displeased!” Yi spoke up, provoking Ji Wuming directly.

“So what about it?” Ji Wuming asked smilingly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I’ll beat you up!”

Yi’s figure flashed, and there was only an afterimage left on the huge rock he had been perched on. Meanwhile, he had already appeared in front of Ji Wuming, and had already shot over a punch.

Ji Wuming made his move, and very casually sliced a hand at Yi’s punch.

All this looked extremely slow, yet it had actually reached its target before Yi’s fist did.

“En, power of Time?” Yi released a low grunt of surprise, which was followed by a cold smirk. “Do you think that you are the only one who has grasped the power of Time?” His golden eye shone brightly. Countless stars were born, but they instantly exploded and died.

It was as if his whole person had become an empty image. He was clearly standing right there, yet seemed like he did not belong to this plane.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. One after another, many Yis appeared. In an instant, more than a dozen of them had appeared, and each shot out a fist that crashed towards Ji Wuming.

“Plucking your own self from the past and future so that you can join forces in the present time?” Ji Wuming said, slightly intrigued. “The one who possesses the Twin Eyes of Destruction is indeed extraordinary, being capable of grasping even this kind of forbidden power.

“One is already frightening enough, but now there are a dozen of them!

“Moreover, every single one is the true self, but aside from the present self, all the other selves do not belong to this time and space, and cannot be killed.

“There is practically no solution to this.”

Ji Wuming seemed like he was making a commentary. Though he said that there was no solution, he did not show the slightest hint of being troubled in his expression. Instead, he tapped out with a finger.

Boom, the whole heaven and earth were trembling, and everything had disappeared from existence, leaving behind only this single finger that split apart the heaven and earth, as if it had opened the sky and struck the earth, bringing all the vicissitudes of eternity.

‘Your power of Time is indeed impressive, and is practically irresolvable, but this finger of mine can split open the heaven and earth, and create a new world.

‘There must be a world first to have Regulations form later. Then, this finger of mine suppresses the power of Time in terms of level.’

Boom!

The finger flicked past, and those more than one dozen Yis suddenly swayed, and then disappeared, leaving only a single one behind.
