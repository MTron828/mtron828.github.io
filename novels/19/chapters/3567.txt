Chapter 3568: Killed

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The two Celestial Path elites battled fiercely, and Ling Han couldn’t interfere either. Hence, he entered the Seven Shattering Sect with his arms crossed behind his back.

“Halt!” The members of the Seven Shattering Sect hurriedly called out.

Ling Han said calmly, “I am the Department Chief of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Dark North Nation. I am now acting on behalf of the heavens, announcing the Seven Shattering Sect as an illegal organization, and disbanding you. All of you should immediately disperse, and behave yourselves. You can be guaranteed peace for the rest of your lives. Otherwise, you will be executed on the basis of a crime against the nation.”

“Who do you think you are? Just because you say it’s illegal, it’s illegal? Just because you say we are disbanded, we are disbanded?” one of them shouted.

Ling Han glanced at that person, and said softly, “Die!”

A golden sword shot out from his mouth. With a ‘pu’, it sank into the man’s chest, and then exited through his body.

With his current strength, it was no issue for him to insta-kill an ordinary Mystery Realm Tier.

Peng, there was still an expression of disbelief on that person’s face. He looked dumbly at the masses, but his body fell backwards, landing heavily on the ground, blood gushing all over the ground.

The Lord Sect Master was currently engaged in a fierce battle with someone. This news naturally alerted the other members of the sect, and they all rushed to the entrance. This scene was also witnessed by a great many people, and they were all breaking out in a cold sweat.

How could he spit out a golden sword from his mouth?

According to legends, there was a Sword Saint that nurtured a sword with his own body. Indeed, he could spit out a flying sword, and kill people from far away.

However, Ling Han was only an Inscription Tier, who was who knew how far away from being a “Celestial”.

“After counting to three, those who are still standing within the Seven Shattering Sect will be killed without mercy!” Ling Han said calmly, “One!” He began to count, his voice filled with vigor, spreading throughout the entire Seven Shattering Sect.

However, he counted very slowly, giving everyone time to retreat.

“Two!” It was indeed slow, but he would not be uttering each word after a gap of a very long while.

The people in front of him dispersed. Without Pang Haifeng standing guard, the Seven Shattering Sect was only a mob.

This sect had not been established for very long, and there were only three people that Pang Haifeng had brought out of the prison. The other members of the sect were all new disciples, so what cohesiveness could they have?

A great catastrophe was imminent, so they naturally fled separately.

Of course, if Pang Haifeng managed to survive this tribulation, they would definitely return. After all, it was easy to enjoy the shade under a large tree©. Elites were pouring like rain now, and without entering into Celestial Path, even Mystery Realm Tiers would only be able to get by very badly.

“Three.”

Ling Han looked around, and he could no longer see a single person in the entire Seven Shattering Sect.

He smiled faintly. The problem now was Pang Haifeng. He definitely had to get rid of this person. Otherwise, even if he chased him away now, it wouldn’t be long before the Seven Shattering Sect would be revived.

The battle between the two Celestial Path elites was incredibly intense, and after about half a day, their speed slowed down. It could not be helped. Even Celestial Path elites did not have an endless supply of power, and there would eventually come a time when they ran out.

However, even if his power was close to exhaustion, that was still a Celestial Path elite. A casual attack would be able to kill a Mystery Realm Tier, and it was still not something that Ling Han could interfere with.

Pang Haifeng howled. He couldn’t hold on any longer.

His opponent had the Battle Armor to continuously provide her with power, so the expenditure was far lesser than his. Furthermore, the defense provided by the Battle Armor was too strong, and he could not break through it at all. Thus, if he continued to expend his power, it would only end in his death.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He decided to flee and submit allegiance to a Core Formation Tier elite.

In this day and age, even the Spirit Transformation True Lords had appeared. It wasn’t embarrassing for him to rely on a Core Formation Tier cultivator. The weak were prey to the strong, and this was a wise choice.

Ling Han could see very clearly. He had long since held the Heavenly Pattern Jade in his hand, and had also completed its compression. When he saw Pang Haifeng turn around, he immediately raised his hand. Xiu, the Heavenly Pattern Jade instantly smashed out, and with Spiritual Power, reached 12 times the speed of sound.

If Pang Haifeng was still in his prime condition, Ling Han wouldn’t have been able to catch sight of him at all.

He couldn’t even find his tracks, so how could he lock onto him?

However, Pang Haifeng’s power was mostly exhausted at this moment, so Ling Han activated his Eye Technique and caught hold of his weakest point. Shua! The Heavenly Pattern Jade directly aimed for Pang Haifeng’s left rib.

Pang Haifeng was just about to flee, but for some reason, a powerful fear rose up in his heart. Instinctively, he stretched out a hand and pressed down.

Peng!

The Heavenly Pattern Jade smashed onto his hand, instantly causing blood to spurt out. Pang Haifeng released a muffled groan, his whole face turning pale.

This strike was really too painful, and had directly shattered five of his fingers! “Damned little beast, I’m going to kill you!” Pang Haifeng cursed. He had never imagined that a dignified and powerful Heavenly Dao Foundation elite would actually be hit by a sneak attack from a mere Inscription Tier, and ended up with five broken fingers at that.

Without Saintly medicine that could regrow flesh and bones, these five fingers would never grow back.

“You won’t be able to kill anyone!” Princess Bixiao declared coldly. Underneath her silver armor, she was as heroic as a goddess of war. Brandishing her battle hammer, she smashed it towards Pang Haifeng, not giving him the chance to attack Ling Han at all.

Pang Haifeng was already at the end of his line in the first place, and now that one of his hands had been crippled, it was natural that his mind was in a state of chaos. After being repeatedly attacked by Princess Bixiao, he continued to throw up blood, and when he wanted to break out of the siege again, Princess Bixiao had already activated the Battle Armor’s acceleration ability, which was even faster than his speed.

His eyes were bloodshot, and he knew that he would not be able to dodge this tribulation today. With this kind of awareness, he threw caution to the wind instead. Ignoring the attacks of Princess Bixiao, he charged fiercely towards Ling Han.

He wanted to drag this junior down with him.

A dignified Heavenly Dao Foundation elite was actually going to drag an Inscription Tier cultivator down with him?

If this spread out, he would definitely become a great joke, but Pang Haifeng hated Ling Han to the core, and he could not possibly wound Princess Bixiao. If he had to drag someone down with him, it could only be Ling Han.

He used the foundation stone of Heavenly Dao to take Princess Bixiao’s attack head-on. This was enough to buy him some time, and if he wanted to kill Ling Han, he only had to stretch out a hand.

Boom!

He delivered a palm strike at Ling Han. This strike condensed all his hatred. Not only did it contain the great power of a Foundation Building cultivator, it was also fused with his Spiritual Power, stimulating a higher level of energy, which turned into a giant hand of fire.

“Die!” he forced out through gritted teeth. He was determined to see Ling Han turn into a pool of blood first, and be burnt to ashes.

Peng, as the attack surged past, even heaven and earth shook.

“Apologies, I have disappointed you.” Ling Han’s calm and unhurried voice rang out from within the rolling mass of energy.

W-what!

Pang Haifeng could not accept this. Even if his strength had fallen further, it would be a piece of cake for him to insta-kill any cultivator below Celestial Path.

Peng, Princess Bixiao would not be reserved with him either. With a blow, Pang Haifeng was instantly sent into the mud.

This Sect Master of the Seven Shattering Sect forcibly got back to his feet. He definitely had to get to the bottom of this. Otherwise, he would die with remaining grievances.

He saw that Ling Han was standing not too far away, and he was wearing a Battle Armor that was flickering with golden light.

p***l

He spat out the last curse word in his life, then collapsed to the ground again. The fact that he was able to stand back up was also because his obsession had not dissipated. In truth, his vital signs had already been destroyed.

It was actually another Battle Armor. Damn it, could it be that this kind of treasure was so common that even Inscription Tiers could wear one?

Meanwhile, Ling Han gritted his teeth. Thankfully, Pang Haifeng’s power was more or less exhausted. Otherwise, in the dying strike of a Heavenly Dao Foundation elite, even if he was wearing a Battle Armor, he would not be able to escape.

Even so, he was still shaken to the point of severe pain all over his body.

T won’t go so far next time. F*ck! I almost lost my life!’
