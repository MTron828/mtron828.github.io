Chapter 1170: Death Valley

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Yellow Spring Mystery Realm was not on the Heavenly Wind Mountain. Instead, it was in the Death Valley that was 100,000 miles away.

It was still within the territory of the Majestic Heaven Sect, but had been a forbidden area since several millennia ago. One should know just from hearing the name. This was the Death Valley; death was the only fate of those who came in.

It wasn’t until Venerable Trinity came here and suppressed the inauspicious air of this place using his supreme techniques that the historical site buried beneath finally reappeared, allowing people to enter, explore, and obtain treasures.

However, this ancient site was no training grounds. It was designed specifically for cultivators to foray into. This place should have been the abode of an elite as it had frightening restrictions in place for protection.

Venerable Trinity had indeed dispersed a part of the formation here, but could not completely do so. Hence, this place could only be visited once every 100 years because it was at such intervals that the might of the restrictions would be weakened the most. With Venerable Trinity in charge of opening the doors, entrance was finally—and only—possible then.

Even so, it could only accommodate the power of the Mountain River Tier at most. If it was too strong, the restrictions would be triggered—that would definitely not lead to a positive result.

Even though Venerable Trinity had disposed of the inauspicious air of this place, it was filled with an eerie coldness. If it was not for the fact that the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm would be opened every 100 years, there would definitely be no one willing to come to this place.

There were no flowers, plants, wild animals, nor birds. This was a completely barren place.

A black aura was exuding from the whole valley. Its exact source could not be found, but it engulfed the whole valley, causing an urge to avoid it arise in people just from seeing it. No one wanted to come in contact with it.

But now, this place was brimming with people. Some had still come here to try their luck even if they had not gotten entrance slots from the Majestic Heaven Sect.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over the gathered masses, and he saw a familiar person that he himself had not seen many times.

...Sha Yuan!

Involuntarily, his eyes frosted over, a sliver of killing intent seeping into his gaze.

This man coveted the treasure in his possession, and had demanded it from him several times. After Ling Han had refused, the former had even sent out people to hunt him down and kill him.

This enmity was one that Ling Han had never forgotten.

Previously, even if Ling Han had wanted to take revenge, he could not find a chance. That was because Sha Yuan had reached the consummate level of Mountain River Tier by himself, and remained at the Academy and the Great General Sha’s Residence all day. How was he supposed to kill him then?

But now?

There was practically no change in Sha Yuan’s cultivation, but Ling Han had already advanced into the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. Furthermore, this place was not Point Star City, but rather a Mystery Realm.

‘Sha Yuan, you should repay your debt to me!’

“So he is Sha Yuan?” the Rain Emperor asked. He had heard Ling Han speak of how he had become enemies with Zhao Lun, Sha Yuan, and the others.

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “En, that’s him.”

“Let us brothers join forces and kill him together!” Murong Qing declared with burning killing intent.

Even the strongest of the three of them had just barely advanced into the high extreme. There was still quite a distance from Sha Yuan’s level. Even if the three of them joined forces, they could not possibly have a chance of winning.

Ling Han shook his head, and declared, “He is mine!”

“After entering into the Mystery Realm, we will move separately,” the Rain Emperor said.

Feng Po Yun nodded as well. They were all brave and courageous characters, filled with confidence in themselves. They had no intention to continue living under Ling Han’s protection.

Ling Han knew he could not convince them otherwise, so he simply nodded, and said, “Be careful!”

He had given enough alchemical pills to his brothers, disciple, and Helian Tianyun. Furthermore, martial arts could not be improved with mere cultivation alone. Practical experience was similarly important.

“Han Lin!” He Tao, Wu Zhe, and four other young men and women with high reputation walked over.

All around them, people stepped back, giving way to this group of six.

They were the six great king tiers of the Mountain River Tier in the Majestic Heaven Sect. They were invincible in the Mountain River Tier, and after entering the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm, they would be truly invincible because Sun Moon Tier elites could not enter. Who would be a match for these six king tiers?

Of course, now, it was seven king tiers.

Ling Han nodded, then clasped his hands, and respectfully said, “Greetings, everyone.”

They had met once before to discuss the matter of opening the treasure trove. Because the treasure trove was in the deepest parts of the Mystery Realm, and there were various fated opportunities on the way there, they could not possibly abandon everything else and head directly there. Thus, they had agreed to move separately before reaching the treasure trove.

Wu Zhe had swept away the embarrassment of his previous loss, and recovered his strong confidence. Even when facing Ling Han again, he did not avoid his gaze.

“That should be about it.”

Very soon, an elite descended from the skies as if he was a heavenly emperor. There was endless divine light trailing behind him as if the heavens themselves were moving for him.

“It’s Venerable!”

Many people called out, incredible reverence on their faces.

In this galaxy, elites of the Eternal River Tier were the strongest existence. Naturally, they were like true gods in everyone’s hearts.

However, no one could distinctly see the actual features of this elite.

Endless divine light entwined around his whole body, so it could not be distinguished whether he was tall or short, man or woman. If it were not for the fact that they knew that there was only one elite of the Eternal River Tier here, they would not have been able to guess his identity at all.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. A great many other figures shot over, and they all stopped behind Venerable Trinity. Upon counting, there were a total of 24 figures.

These were the 24 Heavenly Body Tier elites of the Majestic Heaven Sect. It looked like the operation today was extremely important if it caused all the elites of the Majestic Heaven Sect to turn out in full strength.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them. These 24 people did not disguise their faces, and could be clearly seen. However, aside from Wei Zecheng, Ling Han did not recognize anyone else, and merely memorized these people’s faces.

Venerable Trinity did not waste time on words, and directly stretched out his hands. He began to channel a powerful Mystical Power, sweeping aside the black Qi of this place. Though the wind that was blowing out of the valley was still eerily cold, it was much better now.

This was a necessary step. Otherwise, if one directly stepped in, all those below the Heavenly Body Tier would be completely eliminated.

Venerable Trinity entered the valley. The 24 elites of the Heavenly Body Tier assisted him from the sidelines, dealing with some scattered black Qi, and the others followed behind him.

All those who had received an entrance slot had been given a jade pendant. Before, it had been completely unnoticeable, but at this moment, it was now exuding a soft light, forming a halo, and protecting their owner within.

There were some here to take advantage of the commotion; naturally, they could not possibly possess a jade pendant. They appeared very obvious here.

But what was strange was that the great elites of the Majestic Heaven Sect looked to have no intention of chasing them away. Instead, they allowed them to mingle in with the crowd, much to their confusion.

If the Majestic Heaven Sect had no plans to take control of this Mystery Realm, what was the point of distributing entrance slots, then? After they had opened the Mystery Realm, wouldn’t it be fine if they just allowed others to enter directly?

But those who were here for the first time found out why very soon.

“Ah!” someone shouted in agony as he collapsed onto the ground. He was twitching all over, appearing to be in great suffering. In a mere short moment, all his movements stopped, and all the life signs had vanished from him. He had actually died.

Ling Han was surprised—he had completely not discovered anything off. That person had just died for no conceivable reason.

Since he had already cultivated to the Immortal level, there was definitely no possibility of it being a strange illness, causing him to suddenly die.

If there had to be anything unusual, that was that the dead man was a “stowaway”, and there was no flickering light of a jade pendant from him.

Could it be that this was the reason?
