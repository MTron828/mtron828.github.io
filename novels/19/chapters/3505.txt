Chapter 3506: Gongsun Liang

“Humph, where did you guys get such confidence from?” Shen Tian sneered.

“All right, just as they have said. Eldest Senior Brother, you and I will take down Princess Bixiao, and Ling Han will be handed over to our Junior Brothers,” Tu Jianbai said with a smile.

No matter how they looked at it, they were completely on the upper hand.

“All right.” Shen Tian nodded.

“Attack!” The five of them leaped out at the same time, and blasted out at Ling

Han and Princess Bixiao respectively.

Ling Han’s figure retreated slightly, and he first distanced himself from Shen

Tian and Tu Jianbai.

Those two people were Mystery Realm Tier elites, after all. Ling Han was still no match for them at the moment, so he didn’t want them to take advantage of the opening to attack him. That wouldn’t be a joke.

Bao Zhixue and the others hurriedly set off in pursuit, naturally not allowing

Ling Han to escape.

After putting enough distance between them, Ling Han stopped dodging, and very casually began to battle with Bao Zhixue and the others.

These three people weren’t even one-star geniuses. Fortunately, they were still at the Enlightenment Tier. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to withstand a single strike from Ling Han. Even so, it was only because Ling Han hadn’t unleashed his full power. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to withstand so many strikes.

On the other side, the battle between Princess Bixiao and Shen Tian and Tu

Jianbai was also very intense.

Though there were a great many people in this world that were called prodigies, there were not many that could really be called one-star geniuses.

For example, Shen Tian and Tu Jianbai were only slightly stronger than the average Mystery Realm Tier and were still far from the level of one-star genius.

However, Princess Bixiao was a one-star genius in the first place. Previously, she had failed in her attempt to break through to Celestial Path, yet had accidentally awakened some Primitive Age bloodline, causing her battle prowess to improve further. Though she still could not be considered a two-star genius, she was already very close.

Both of them were at the Consummate level of Mystery Realm Tier. Two of them had ordinary battle prowess, while the third was almost a two-star genius. What suspense would there be in this battle?

However, just like Ling Han, Princess Bixiao hadn’t unleashed her full battle prowess yet. Thus, her battle with Shen Tian was also extremely drawn out.

“Guys, why don’t you hand over your Spatial Shen Tian? Let us inspect them to avoid any injuries!” Shen Tian still couldn’t tell that they were at a disadvantage, and he was actually trying to persuade Ling Han and Princess

Bixiao to surrender.

Ling Han sighed, and asked, “What is the most important thing for a person?”

“To be thick-skinned.”

“Courageous.”

“Being shameless.”

“Must be black-hearted.”

The toddlers spoke one after another, each calling out louder than the last.

Ling Han’s expression darkened. ‘Is that what I taught you?’

He hurriedly shook his head, and said, “The most important thing for a person is to have self-awareness. You are obviously just a few clowns, yet you still jump up and down. Aren’t you just making a fool of yourself?”

Peng! Peng! Peng!

He suddenly exerted force, and shot out three consecutive punches. Bao Zhixue and the others were all sent flying, completely losing their battle prowess.

Seeing Ling Han flip out, Princess Bixiao also increased her battle prowess, sending Shen Tian and Tu Jianbai backwards.

What!

Shen Tian and the others were all shocked. They had not thought that Ling Han and the princess would actually have such powerful battle prowess. They were practically two freaks.

Ling Han was no longer cordial, and said, “Go back and tell Gongsun Liang that our patience is limited, and so is His Majesty’s patience. If he still doesn’t come to see us tomorrow, then Highest Splendor Sect could possibly be destroyed in a single day!”

Shen Tian and the others were both furious and embarrassed. Five against two, their cultivation level was not weak, and they had the advantage in numbers. And they were still being overwhelmed, so what excuse did they have left?

“Ling Han, you actually dare to threaten a Celestial Path elite?” Shen Tian shouted harshly.

“Defeated opponent, don’t blabber nonsense. Hurry up and deliver the message.” Ling Han waved his hand dismissively.

You weren’t the one who defeated me.

However, Ling Han and Princess Bixiao were on the same side, so he had no

face to argue.

The five of them humphed as they glanced at Ling Han and Princess Bixiao before turning around to leave.

They did not use the Burst Cloud Crossbow, and left behind the last shred of their pride that had not been torn open — if they really wanted to kill Ling Han and his companion, Gongsun Liang only had to move personally. Just how strong was a Celestial Path elite?

“You really took their treasure chamber?” Princess Bixiao was surprised. This was the treasure chamber of a Celestial Path elite.

Ling Han spread out his hands, “Don’t spout nonsense when there is no evidence.”

“Hehe.” Princess Bixiao smirked coldly, slanting a sideways glance at Ling Han. Ling Han could only raise his hand, and said, “We agreed that you too would have a share. Here, take it.”

He handed over a necklace.

Princess Bixiao naturally wouldn’t be reserved. After receiving the necklace and examining it carefully, she frowned and asked, “How does this Spirit Tool work?”

“Ah, this is a golden necklace. It looks good on you,” Ling Han said sagely. Princess Bixiao’s expression instantly froze. Wasn’t this just toying with her?

“Ling Han!” she shouted frantically.

“Alright, alright, alright. I’ll give this to you, all right?” Ling Han sighed, and handed over something else.

This was a piece of metal, yet it was as transparent as jade. It was extremely strange.

“Golden Jade.” Princess Bixiao knew her stuff, and immediately said, “This is a One Star material, and can be used to forge a high-level Spirit Tool!”

“As long as you’re satisfied,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Princess Bixiao looked at Ling Han. This guy had given her a One Star Material right from the get go, so his gains must be far more than that. However, this was what Ling Han had obtained, and she had only kindly accepted the hush money. Was a One Star Material not enough?

She could not be too greedy either.

Following this guy was a good way to make money, and no formation could stop him.

This thought suddenly popped up in Princess Bixiao’s mind.

Ling Han’s gains were naturally even greater. He had obtained a total of four One Star materials, but he already had two Spirit Tools in his possession, and his sword was also a Two Star weapon. Thus, he naturally did not place much importance on One Star materials.

Aside from that, there was a large amount of jade seed, and lastly, there was a rock. It looked like it had been knocked down from a stone tablet, and there were two and a half words on it, but Ling Han did not recognize any of them.

Ling Han couldn’t tell what kind of precious material this rock was made from. It was grayish white in color, and though it looked quite old, that was all. It exuded an ancient aura.

However, for Gongsun Liang to store this inside the treasure chamber, there must be something special about it. It was just that he had not discovered it yet.

Unexpectedly, Gongsun Liang appeared that afternoon.

A terrifying aura enveloped them, and Ling Han, Princess Bixiao, and the seven babies all felt their hearts throb. They all went out, and saw that there was already a middle-aged man standing in the middle of the courtyard.

This man clasped his hands behind his back, his head slightly raised, looking at the skies at a forty-five degree angle, exuding a strong air of posturing.

However, he did indeed have the right to show off. He stood there, as if he was naturally one with the heaven and earth. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Gongsun Liang.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao both thought. The Highest Splendor Sect only had one Celestial Path-level elite, so there was no need to guess the identity of this person.

“Sect Leader Gongsun.” Ling Han and Princess Bixiao both clasped their hands in greeting.

Since Gongsun Liang had no intention of surrendering, he naturally wouldn’t show any respect to mortals like them. He simply nodded coldly.

“Hand over what you stole yesterday!” he said directly..
