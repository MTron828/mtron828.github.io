Chapter 1163: Gao Faction

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was slightly astonished. People actually went to such great lengths for a Mystery Realm? This proved just how extraordinary that place was. Otherwise, why would those powerful forces make so many preparations?

“By the looks of it, I’ll have to tag along with you guys when the Mystery Realm opens,” he said with a smile.

These prodigies were all successors of super-powerful forces. As such, they were extremely well-informed regarding the situation inside the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm. Ling Han refused to believe that the forces behind them would remain inactive faced with the temptation of the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm.

Perhaps those kinds of “Mountain River Tier” cultivators would also follow them into the Mystery Realm.

“Hehe!” Shao Sisi and the others all chuckled in reply.

There was no need to lie to someone who already knew their secret. It was because they also engaged in such practices that they knew of these secrets.

“Brother Ling, you can ask for whatever you want if you’re willing to join my Thousand Frost Majestic Empire!” Shao Sisi said. There was a glimmer in her bright eyes, and air of charm exuded from her body.

Her promise, coupled with her gaze, was almost as if she were saying “I’ll even consider marrying you”.

“Hehe, Brother Ling, I have a little sister, and she’s a stunning beauty who’s worth sacrificing nations and cities for!” Du An said hurriedly. “You together with her are a match made in heaven! I guarantee that I can earn a position of a duke for Brother Ling.”

“Join the Domineering Summer Majestic Empire, and we’ll be blood brothers!” Xia Wuque said.

Ling Han had already proved his talent; he was worth this price.

Although Ling Han had offended Yang Hao, Yang Hao was only at the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, his background wasn’t any stronger than theirs. It could be said that as long as Yang Hao didn’t reach the Eternal River Tier, they needed not be afraid of him.

Anyhow, even if he could reach the Eternal River Tier, how many years later would that be?

Yang Hao had only taken less than 1000 years to reach the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. However, it was a huge and difficult leap to advance from the Sun Moon Tier to the Heavenly Body Tier, to say nothing of the Eternal River Tier. There was only a single Eternal River Tier elite in the galaxy, and this proved just how extraordinarily difficult it was to reach this tier.

Thus, his several hundred years’ lead over Ling Han would disappear in no time. In the future, advancing just a single tier would take him tens of thousands of years. A period of several centuries was nothing compared to this.

Meanwhile, Ling Han skirted around their questions and avoided giving any answer. He already had his own force, so how could he join someone else’s empire? In any case, even if were to join one, it would be the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

After all, even the empress was his!

Of course, he only dared to say this in his mind. Otherwise, the Eternity Sky Emperor, Jade Drop Emperor, and even a few members of the Seven Generals might charge over to the Majestic Heaven Sect to kill him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When the gathering concluded, Ling Han met up with the Rain Emperor, Feng Po Yun, Murong Qing, and Helian Tianyun and started to drink again.

Now that Ling Han had arrived, they could naturally cultivate under the Reincarnation Tree again.

Meanwhile, Ling Han snuck out for a break and took Shui Yanyu to a field of flowers far away from the Reincarnation Tree.

“Wife, our son is so fortunate!” Ling Han said in admiration as he cupped his hands over her voluptuous breasts.

Helian Xian Xue’s breasts were pitifully small in comparison. It was with great fortune that her flat chest hadn’t starved their son to death.

Although they had already become one, Shui Yanyu was still easily embarrassed. Her face flushed red, and she turned around to bite his wrist, chiding, “Damn pervert!”

Her sparkling eyes were filled with affection.

Ling Han’s heart shuddered in excitement, and he said, “Thankfully I was shameless enough. Otherwise, how could such a beautiful teacher have become the mother of my child?”

Shui Yanyu struggled weakly, and scolded, “If you weren’t pervertedly groping me while saying this, perhaps I might have been moved! Now, however, I only want to bite this damn pervert to death!”

“Is your zodiac the dog? You’re actually going to bite me?” A playful look flashed across his eyes, and he said, “If you like biting so much, I can teach you a new kind of game. I guarantee you’ll be able to ‘bite’ and ‘nibble’ to your heart’s content.”

He started to whisper in Shui Yanyu’s ears, and her eyes instantly widened in astonishment. She couldn’t help but leap up and jump on top of Ling Han’s body. “Damn pervert! Stupid pervert! Shameless pervert!”

Ling Han laughed heartily, and said, “So, wife, it turns out that you like to take the lead! Come, your hubby will let you do as you please today!”

Shui Yanyu pinched him aggressively. Why did this person always tease her until she became utterly embarrassed?

“Gasp! Say, wife, where are you pinching!” Ling Han purposefully clenched his teeth and sucked in a sharp breath.

Shui Yanyu looked down, only to find that she had pinched his erect buddy. She was so embarrassed that she could barely look Ling Han in the eyes.

“Hehe, wife, I love it when you’re like this,” Ling Han said with a chuckle. “You’re clearly a seductive beauty, yet you’re so easily embarrassed.”

“Damn! Pervert!”

***

After battling against Wu Zhe and Yang Hao, Ling Han naturally became renowned throughout the Majestic Heaven Sect. Although Hu Feiyun’s performance had been more stunning, everyone knew that her power was derived from the spiritual mark in her body. Her actual power was only so-so.

The next morning, an endless stream of people came to visit Ling Han. They wanted to become friends or at least become acquainted with him.

Ling Han didn’t act haughtily. Instead, he talked and joked with them...

...because in his eyes, these people were walking piggy banks!

Those who could enter the Majestic Heaven Sect were generally all successors of powerful forces. The only thing they weren’t short on was money.

He needed to earn money, so he had naturally placed his focus on alchemy. Once he refined pills, these people would become his customers.

Ling Han chuckled gleefully.

His attitude was warm and welcoming, and those who came to visit all felt flattered by his hospitality. They hadn’t expected for Ling Han to be so modest and kind.

Meanwhile, Shui Yanyu shook her head in pity. She knew Ling Han extremely well, so she naturally knew what he was thinking. ‘These people are being treated as pigs for slaughter, yet they’re still thanking Ling Han so profusely. Sure enough, they’re being sold and still helping the seller count his profits.’

Then, her mind wandered to herself. Hadn’t she also been willingly captured by him?

“This sweetheart!” Her voice was embarrassed yet affectionate.

“Cough, this is Senior Brother Han, am I correct?” A man in green walked over, and a look of amazement flashed across his face as his eyes swept over Shui Yanyu. He glanced at her once more before turning his eyes to Ling Han.

Ling Han’s impression of him was already at rock-bottom. “That’s right, I’m Ling Han,” he said indifferently.

The man in green smiled haughtily, and said, “I’m Gai Yongsi, and I’ve come from the Gao Faction.”

“What Gao Faction?” Ling Han hated it when others acted haughtily before him. He felt annoyed just looking at the smug face of the man in green.

Gai Yongsi remained unfazed, and said, “Senior Brother Han, you still don’t know, do you? Our Majestic Heaven Sect is actually split into several factions. Our founder took nine disciples in total, and thus the factions led by them are the strongest. The Gao Faction is one such faction.”

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Venerable Trinity didn’t wish to dominate the galaxy, yet by the looks of it, his nine disciples were definitely no peace-lovers.

Once the Venerable Trinity passed away, this galaxy would definitely descend into chaotic war, one which would require maps to be redrawn.

“So what?” Ling Han said indifferently.

A hint of anger crept onto Gai Yongsi’s face. Hadn’t Ling Han heard him say that he had come from the Gao Faction, a faction that was founded by one of Venerable Trinity’s disciples? However, he forcefully suppressed his anger upon remembering the objective of his visit. “I’ve come on behalf of the young master to specially invite Senior Brother Han to join our Gao Faction.”
