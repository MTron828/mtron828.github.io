1278 All Elites Move Out, Hunt Down Ling Han

The higher-ups of the Five Sects sat together, discussing how they should deal with Ling Han.

Five Sun Moon Tier-level forces, or perhaps among the top five greatest sects in this echelon, were actually joining forces to hunt down an ant from a small world who was only in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. In the past, this would have been unimaginable to them.

But now, they were all thinking they had to eliminate him.

“That damn brat must have gotten some great fated opportunity to be capable of opening the sky previously. Otherwise, he could not have risen up in a short 20 years’ time. This has broken the laws of the cultivation world.”

“That’s right. He managed to accommodate the power of the nation of the whole Lower Realm. This would have a frightening requirement for his physique.”

“He must have gotten a precious treasure in the Lower Realm, and only then did he manage to advance so quickly even in the Immortal Realm.”

“The Lower Realm is not so simple. At least, the 12 military officers subordinate to the Heavenly River King all entered this small world, and left behind their supreme inheritance.”

“Unfortunately, the small world suppressed our power. We could not forcefully open the Twelve Palaces even if we entered.”

“Perhaps... this brat has obtained the inheritance of the Heavenly River King!”

Gasp!

The members of the Five Sects could no longer stay calm. Who was the Heavenly River King? In truth, they weren’t very clear, either. They only knew that this was an incredibly powerful existence. Actually, even the 12 military officers were powerful and invincible.

If they could obtain the inheritance of the Heavenly River King... no, even if it was just the inheritance of the 12 military officers, then they would at least be capable of matching Eternal River Tier, wouldn’t they?

Who would be willing to accept inferiority? Especially in the case of cultivators, all of them had their own pride.

“We must apprehend that damn brat!”

“Since he seeks his own demise from so far away, how can we not oblige?”

“Send out all the elites!”

The Five Sects soon reached an agreement, which was to mobilize all the elites in their sects. Furthermore, to prevent one of the other sects from keeping the treasures to themselves, every team in search of Ling Han was a mix of people from all Five Sects. Each sect would send out two people, and small teams comprised of 10 members were thus born.

Of course, even if it was the Five Sects, they still had a limited number of Sun Moon Tier elites. Although sending out so many people into the vast Two Realm Battlefield was not equivalent to a drop of water entering the ocean, in truth there was not much difference from that.

Moreover, considering the fact that Ling Han would occasionally enter into the Black Tower to concoct alchemical pills, the chances of them successfully finding Ling Han dropped considerably.

In truth, Ling Han had no plans of hiding. He very boldly searched for both his enemies and Realm Spirit Stones in the Two Realm Battlefield, yet still did not encounter anyone from the Five Sects, so what could he do?

When it looked like three months were about to pass, Ling Han was both expectant and anxious.

Very soon, he would be able to take the Berserk Blood Spirit Pill to improve his power, but before that, he had to first burn himself in the immortal flame. Just the thought of that caused a muscle to twitch in his cheek.

Ding, ding, ding.

Sounds of battle could be heard ahead of him. Ling Han was not the nosy type, but this was the Two Realm Battlefield. What if it was a battle between beings of the Netherworld and cultivators of the Immortal Realm?

He immediately rushed forwards, but when he saw both sides of the battle, he couldn’t help but shake his head.

This was not a conflict between the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld. Instead, both sides were human.

Obviously, this was either a battle of vengeance, or a fight for profit. And in the case of profit, it would be even simpler. A Realm Spirit Stone should have appeared here, which caused a conflict to rise up between the two sides.

However, both sides were very strong as they were on the level of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

Whey they saw Ling Han suddenly appear, both sides paused slightly. However, when they realized that Ling Han was all alone, and his cultivation level was only in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, naturally no one would care about him. They continued the battle once more.

“Stop! Stop!” However, only after a few moves, one of the two sides suddenly called a halt.

“Humph, you were the ones who picked the fight, now what do you want to do?” the other side asked.

The person who called a halt said, “We’ll let you have that Realm Spirit Stone.”

This shocked the other side. To be honest, they were at a disadvantage here, yet if the other side wanted to eliminate all of them, they would also have to pay a heavy price. Thus, the other side was planning on wearing them down until their side lost all their fighting spirit and took the initiative to hand over the Realm Spirit Stone in exchange for a chance to flee all this while.

But they had never thought that the other side would actually stop the battle at this time.

They retreated, and saw the other side did not move. After carefully running far enough into distance, they hurriedly ran with their full strength, and very soon disappeared.

“Hehehe, this is really travelling far and wide to look for you, only to find you easily. You actually delivered yourself right to our doorstep,” a middle-aged man who had a sword on his back said calmly, his eyes fixed on Ling Han, exuding a powerful coldness from his gaze.

“The intelligence is indeed accurate. Medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier!” a middle-aged woman continued.

“Brat, kneel and accept your death. We can give you a quick end.” This was an old woman. Her figure was humped, and she held a walking stick in her hand.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “What a coincidence. I was just thinking of looking for you guys!”

He saw the sign of the Heaven’s Sword Palace on the two people’s sleeves, and out of the remaining eight, every two people had the same sign. Very easily, he deduced that they came respectively from the Cloud Phoenix Sect, Absolute Saber Sect, Blue Thunder Sect, and Earth Dragon Sect.

“Humph, I have always wanted to see how this brat that opened the sky looked like. Has he actually eaten the liver of a True Dragon or the heart of a True Phoenix to actually be so outrageously bold?” The old woman raised the walking stick, and then suddenly sent it down in a series of knocks. Ka, ka, ka. Suddenly, a crack appeared on the ground’s surface, and quickly stretched out towards Ling Han.

And just as the ground cracked open, there actually appeared endless darkness underground, which formed multiple snake-like creatures.

They weren’t snakes but Earth Dragons, or rather earthworms.

“DIsgusting!” Ling Han humphed, and sent out his sword in a slash. Millions of sword projections swept out, and these earthworms were all severed into pieces, once again turning into shadows.

At this strike, all 10 members of the Five Sects looked shocked.

Though the old woman had not used her full power, Ling Han was still very carefree and relaxed, not revealing his true abilities, either.

This young man... could not be underestimated.

“Hehe, please hold the lines for me, everyone. Don’t let this junior flee, and wait until I take him down.” The sword-bearing man took one step forwards. Suddenly, sword intent set out, the sharp Qi cutting right through the air itself.

He was an elite from the Heaven’s Sword Palace. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Sword cultivators indeed possessed frightening destructive ability.

Among the Five Sects, whether it was the Earth Dragon Sect, the Cloud Phoenix Sect, or the Blue Thunder Sect, they were actually not pure humans, but rather half human, which meant that they were the descendants born from the union of Divine Beast and human.

They were stronger than ordinary Immortals, especially when they awakened their bloodline. They weren’t just a little bit stronger at that time. For example, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier only after 10,000 years since entering into the Immortal Realm.

Unfortunately, it was limited to the level of the Five Sects. They did not have any cultivation technique to allow them to advance one step further, and could only remain on the consummate level. If they did not get any special encounter, they would remain on this level for the rest of their lives.

However, the Heaven’s Sword Palace could stand as an equal with these three sects, and from one aspect, it proved how strong sword cultivators were since they could compensate for their shortcoming of the lack of bloodline.

Furthermore, this elite had reached the peak stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Merely aiming the tip of his blade at Ling Han, he made Ling Han feel as if his skin was about to tear. His sword intent was truly frightening.

Too strong!
