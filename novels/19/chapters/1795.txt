The woman cast a cold glance at the old ancestor, and it was as if she viewed him not as an Immortal Palace Tier elite, but rather as a mere ant.

Just how much contempt was she showing?

The old ancestor was called Fu Dongxue, and he had already reached the Immortal Palace Tier hundreds of billions of years ago, granting him a limitless lifespan. He wasn’t the strongest elite of the Fu Clan, and he could, in fact, be considered as one of the weakest. However, an Immortal Palace Tier elite was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, after all, and one could be regarded as a supreme elite even if they had only cultivated a single secret palace.

If anyone else dared to treat him with such contempt, he would have already charged over and smacked them to death. However, he didn’t dare to attack this woman.

This was because she was also at the Immortal Palace Tier.

Moreover, after reaching this major tier, it was already impossible to determine each other’s specific cultivation level unless they released their aura. It was because of this that Fu Dongxue felt slightly apprehensive, and didn’t dare to rashly attack her. He was afraid of coming up against a brick wall.

As an old ancestor, if he were defeated at the entrance of his clan, that would be a humiliating matter that would accompany him forever.

Even so, Fu Dongxue was still brimming with confidence. Even though he was up against 11 people, only their leader had reached the Immortal Palace Tier. The remaining people were all at the Dividing Soul Tier. This was indeed a supremely powerful group of cultivators, yet they were only strong enough to gain the attention of the Fu Clan. They were still far too weak to frighten the Fu Clan.

Of course, the Fu Clan naturally didn’t wish to battle against Immortal Palace Tier elites if they didn’t need to. After all, doing so would result in huge losses for both sides.

“Where’s Ling Han?” the female knight asked coldly. Her gaze was as haughty as could be.

‘Ling Han? Who’s Ling Han?’

Although Ling Han had shot to fame recently, his matters still hadn’t been significant enough to capture the attention of Immortal Palace Tier elites. Thus, Fu Dongxue naturally didn’t recognize his name.

Xiu!

Right at this moment, a shuttle shot over at an incredible speed before grinding to a sudden halt. A tall and skinny elder leaped out from the shuttle, and he swept his gaze around the surroundings before saying, “Old Monster Xue, I’m here to ask for a person!”

His voice was like thunder as it boomed through the air.

Fu Dongxue’s pupils contracted slightly, and he asked, “Han Luo, what’s the meaning of this? You actually ran over here to ask for a person?”

Han Luo was an ancestor of the Han Clan, a three-star force. He was also an Immortal Palace Tier elite, and like Fu Dongxue, he had also cultivated a single secret palace. The two of them had battled against each other 100 or so times during their incredibly long lifetime, and it could be said that they were extremely familiar with each other.

“Humph! An audacious brat destroyed the physical body of a junior of my clan in the Ancient Realm. Not only that, but he’s provoked the Han Clan time and time again. Our ancient ancestor has already issued a clan order to kill this brat!” Han Luo said.

Fu Dongxue frowned upon hearing this. The ancient ancestor of the Han Clan had actually issued a clan order? This signified that the Han Clan was hellbent on killing their target.

However, which brat had dared to act with such audacity?

“Whom are you looking for?” he asked.

“Ling Han!”

Pu!

Fu Dongxue instantly choked upon hearing this, and his expression became as strange as could be.

‘Ling Han... it’s Ling Han again!

‘Who in the world is this brat? He actually attracted two Immortal Palace Tier elites to the Fu Clan?’

Perhaps Fu Dongxue had never heard of this name before, but he would certainly never forget it again after today.

If he learned that Ling Han had also offended the female successor of the Zihe Clan, perhaps he would be so shocked that he would spit out a mouthful of blood. This Ling Han was definitely a sign of misfortune!

Fu Dongxue turned to the woman, and asked, “Friend, has the brat Ling Han also wounded members of your clan?”

Since Ling Han wasn’t a member of the Fu Clan, nor a member of the Fu Clan’s subordinate forces, Fu Dongxue naturally wouldn’t hesitate in sentencing him to death. After all, the Fu Clan definitely couldn’t start a conflict with the Han Clan or any other three-star force because of a measly brat like Ling Han.

However, he was feeling hesitant because Han Luo and the woman had clearly come from two different forces. As such, whom should he hand the brat to?

The female knight’s gaze was cold, and she impatiently said, “Are you going to hand him over or not? Why are you spewing so much nonsense?”

Fu Dongxue was almost angered to death.

‘I’m also an Immortal Palace Tier elite, so what’s with your attitude? Moreover, it’s you who’s asking me for a person, not the other way around! Your attitude is far too arrogant and haughty, no?’

Upon hearing the woman’s words, Han Luo immediately turned to her and said in a firm voice, “Friend, Ling Han belongs to the Han Clan!”

The Han Clan wasn’t simply seeking Ling Han to exact revenge. Instead, they were also lusting over the secret techniques that he possessed.

In the beginning, they had suspected that Ling Han was the successor of some Celestial King Tier force. However, after pondering over this for a while, they discovered that he wasn’t worthy of holding such a position. That being the case, they concluded that Ling Han had obtained the inheritance and treasures of a deceased Celestial King. As such, they definitely had to capture him no matter what so that they could extract his soul and obtain his secrets.

Ling Han definitely couldn’t fall into the hands of others.

The female knight glanced at Han Luo, and asked, “Are you threatening me?” Her gaze was ice-cold and emotionless.

Han Luo’s heart shuddered, and it was as if it were about to leap into his throat. This was a terrible feeling, and he almost jumped up to throw a punch at the woman. It was as if she were a formidable beast.

He was utterly astounded. The woman was clearly at the Immortal Palace Tier, so why did he feel such overwhelming pressure from her?

“The Han Clan must personally kill Ling Han! Friend, if Ling Han has also offended you, the result will be the same if the Han Clan deals with him,” Han Luo said. His tone was much softer than before.

The female knight frowned upon hearing this. There was impatience on her face, and she said, “Hurry up and piss off. Otherwise, I’ll kill you right here and now!” Her piercing gaze swept over, and a boundless killing intent instantly surged toward Han Luo. Even the sky shuddered slightly.

Han Luo couldn’t help but feel apprehension. However, he immediately exploded in rage. He was an Immortal Palace Tier elite, and he could be regarded as a powerful elite no matter where he went. In fact, he would be highly valued even if he went to a Celestial King Tier force.

Yet, this woman actually wanted to kill him?

F*ck!

“If the tiger doesn’t roar, you’ll think I’m an ill cat!” Han Luo said in a cold voice. If he didn’t show his might, it was clear that the woman would continue to act all high and mighty.

At the end of the day, everything still revolved around power.

The woman shot a cold glance at Han Luo before extending her right hand and smacking it toward him. “You’re seeking death!”

“How audacious!!” Han Luo roared. This woman was far too domineering and wanton.

After shouting this, however, his jaw involuntarily dropped, and his eyes involuntarily widened. This was because the female knight’s attack had caused large swathes of divine iridescent clouds to form in the sky. At the same time, the great dao transformed into soaring columns that plummeted down toward him.

This was far too powerful! This was far too terrifying!

“Fifth secret!” Fu Dongxue exclaimed in a quivering voice. His hands were shaking in fear.

What was an Immortal Palace?

In fact, the Immortal Palace Tier should have been referred to as the Immortal Organs Tier. This major tier involved cultivating one’s internal organs into secret palaces. The organs of importance were the heart, the liver, the spleen, the lungs, and the kidneys. After cultivating all five of these organs into secret palaces, one would have reached the pinnacle of the Immortal Palace Tier.

In other words, the Immortal Palace Tier had a total of five minor levels.

Fu Dongxue had only cultivated a single secret palace, so his cultivation level could be referred to as the first secret, first palace, or first immortal palace. However, once the woman unleashed her attack, he immediately realized that she was a fifth secret elite!

When a fourth severance cultivator attacked a first severance cultivator, what would the result be? An instant kill! When a heaven soul elite attacked a yang soul elite, what would the result be? Instant kill!

So, when a fifth secret elite attacked a first secret elite, what would the result be?

It would naturally be an instant kill!

Boom!

Divine iridescent clouds surged into the surroundings, and the glow of the Regulations suffused through the sky. At the same time, Han Luo’s figure comprehensively vanished.

He had been annihilated into nothingness!

Fu Dongxue’s legs started to tremble uncontrollably. An Immortal Palace Tier elite—someone who could act as he pleased in the surrounding millions of large cities—had been insta-killed by someone just like that. Both his body and his divine sense had been completely obliterated.

‘This... where in the world is this female knight from?!’
