Chapter 3483: Three Styles of the God of War

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Though there was no hint, as long as one “saw” that dragon-shaped statue, everyone could guess that this was the end of the palace.

That was the statue of a young dragon. When one arrived at the feet of the young dragon, or touched the young dragon, they should be the final victor of this time’s Young Dragon Trial.

At present, there was still Ling Han, Hong Tianbu, Hu Er, and Princess Bixiao who could still move.

Who would be able to emerge victorious?

“Scram!” Hong Tianbu immediately turned around and charged towards Princess Bixiao. He threw a punch, wanting to blast Princess Bixiao aside.

Hu Er abandoned Ling Han, and intercepted Hong Tianbu.

Previously, he had gone to block Ling Han, but it was not to pave the way for Hong Tianbu.

Ling Han rubbed his body and approached. This time, it had become a battle royale between three parties. Aside from Hu Er, the other two wanted to charge through the doors.

Hu Er only attacked and didn’t defend. He wanted to hold back Ling Han and Hong Tianbu, so he was naturally attacked by the two of them. Soon, the golem’s damage reached 100%, and he could only stare helplessly.

Ling Han and Hong Tianbu continued to battle as they chased after Princess Bixiao. This woman was the first to charge through the doors.

Ling Han sent Hong Tianbu flying with a single punch. His power was at an absolute advantage. Then, his legs exploded with his full power. Peng, peng, peng! He ran as fast as he could, and set off in pursuit of Princess Bixiao.

Princess Bixiao was only about six meters away from the stone dragon. Just when she thought that she was about to win, she sensed Ling Han’s approach.

She hurriedly ran with all her might. Even if everyone joined forces, they were still no match for Ling Han. It was obviously not a good idea for her to turn around and fight.

However, before she had even ran three steps, Ling Han had already caught up to her. With a crash, peng, she immediately fell to the side.

She hurriedly charged back, throwing a punch at Ling Han.

Ling Han turned around and threw a punch, blocking this blow from Princess Bixiao. However, it was also because of this that his momentum naturally stopped. Meanwhile, Hong Tianbu was also rapidly closing in on him. Without the slightest hesitation, he threw another punch at Ling Han, wanting to take advantage of the opening to surpass him.

Peng!

Ling Han swept Hong Tianbu onto the ground with a sweep of his leg. The golem’s weight was extremely heavy, releasing a deep sound.

At this time, Princess Bixiao also took advantage of the opening to advance. As long as she was the first to stand in front of the stone statue, she would be the victor.

Unfortunately, she had only run a few steps, when Ling Han caught up to her again. He crashed into her again, and she was thrown off course.

Hong Tianbu picked himself up and gave chase again, but the distance was already too far, and he couldn’t catch up at all.

Ling Han was the first to reach the dragon statue. He placed his hand on it, and instantly, the entire stone statue lit up. Boom, a wave of light surged out, and the palace that had initially been radiating with brilliance immediately darkened.

Ling Han automatically floated out of the golem. Then, being drawn by a force, he slowly floated in midair.

“No—” Hong Tianbu also jumped out of the golem. Now that the death light had disappeared, he naturally wasn’t afraid of being illuminated to death. He took large strides towards Ling Han, and with a battle cry, jumped high up, delivering a palm strike.

Weng, with a flash of light, Hong Tianbu was sent flying, unable to approach Ling Han at all.

The others also came out of the golems one after another, but did not attack, because Ling Han had obtained first place and gained the approval of this place of trial, so they couldn’t hurt him at all.

They were both disappointed and rueful. Who would have thought that the person who had won would actually be a “weakling” in the Extreme Bone Tier?

In Ling Han’s mind, there was a brilliant light flickering, forming countless characters, and these formed a human figure, playing out some kind of technique.

This was… the Three Styles of the God of War! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han grasped the information contained within. Three Styles of the God of War, drawing on the power of heaven and earth, and unleashing a mighty attack. Each style was fiercer than the last, but the limit was three styles. After the third style, the body would have to bear an indescribable burden, and would no longer be able to use any style.

This was a real powerful move, just like the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

Even so, Ling Han still felt slightly regretful. This was the final reward for the Young Dragon Trial?

Wasn’t this a little too petty?

It felt inferior to the supplementary cultivation technique that he had obtained in the mural.

Forget it. This could not be protested, and it was already said that this was a selection of candidates for Young Dragon. As long as they could stand out from the nine peaks, they would be able to participate in the True Dragon Trial in future.

Being able to take the name of True Dragon, this trial should have a lot of rewards.

Ling Han hung high in the air, while a True Dragon danced furiously behind him. No matter which peak one was on, they could still see it clearly.

“What, he actually obtained the first place in the Young Dragon Trial?”

“Ling Han, one of the twin prodigies of the Imperial City?”

“Isn’t he an Extreme Bone Tier; he is capable of suppressing Hong Tianbu?”

“Didn’t the Demon Race also send a great many prodigies? That Hu Er is known as the number one prodigy of the Demon Race, yet he still couldn’t suppress a measly Extreme Bone Tier cultivator?”

“Don’t you guys know that cultivation level is suppressed here?”

“True.”

“Then doesn’t that mean that Ling Han is the strongest in a battle of equals?”

“This must be the only explanation.”

Everyone was rueful. As for the real situation, they were not sure, and could only make deductions based on the information they knew. Though they had not completely guessed correctly, Ling Han had indeed obtained the first place in the Young Dragon Trial by chance. It was because his battle prowess at the same cultivation level was the strongest, and that was why he could become the champion of the Young Dragon Trial.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! In an instant, everyone in the trial grounds were repelled by a mysterious and powerful force, and they were sent out of the ancient site one after another. Like flowers being scattered, they scattered near the entrance.

It was the same for Ling Han. He had been thrown to the side of a stream, and there was a gentle force wrapped around him. Right until he landed on the ground, this force finally disappeared, so that he would not die from falling from a high position.

He looked at his wrist. There was a third mark on it, and it had also disappeared without a trace.

He had been stamped again?

Why did the people here like stamps so much?

He shook his head, and immediately moved. He had to pick up the children, and then return to the Imperial Capital.

However, he had not walked too far, when he bumped into a group of people.

He did not know these five people, but they obviously knew him. At first, he was stunned, and then looked pleasantly surprised.

“Seventh Uncle, this brat is Ling Han.” One of them pointed at Ling Han, appearing slightly excited.

“Haha, I’ve really searched high and low for you, and you’ve delivered yourself to my doorstep.” One of the five people was a middle-aged man, while the other four were all very young. The middle-aged man laughed loudly, his expression also filled with excitement.

Ling Han stroked his chin, and asked, “Are you people treating me like a fat sheep?”

“A mere Extreme Bone Tier cultivator has become the number one in the Young Dragon Trial. Instead of finding a place to hide, you’re actually strutting around in public like this. Say, if I don’t kill you and snatch your fated opportunity, will the heavens forgive me?” The middle-aged man was still laughing loudly.

“You’re that confident?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Hehe, do you think that just because you obtained the first place in the Young Dragon Trial, you are invincible in this world?” The middle-aged man sneered, “In a battle of equal cultivation levels, you may indeed be number one in this world, but unfortunately, I will not be battling you at the same cultivation level now!”

“I am… Enlightenment Tier!” the man declared proudly..
