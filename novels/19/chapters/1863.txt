Chapter 1864: Another discussion of victory or defeat

The Shantian Clan could be considered an old clan of Alchemy City. They were not a noble clan of alchemists, but their clan’s ancestor was a Dividing Soul Tier elite, and was quite well known even in the third level. Yet now, they had actually suffered a setback in the first level; this naturally made them feel humiliated.

If it were not for the sake of decreasing the pressure of the competition, Shantian Wu would not have possibly come deliberately to the first level to participate. And contrary to his expectations, he had not even managed to pass the first round.

However, now that Ling Han had offended the Shantian Clan, did he think he could pretend nothing had happened?

If it were not for the fact that this was Alchemy City, Ling Han would have long since died 100 times over.

Ling Han crooked a finger, and said, “Looks like you, too, want to be beaten.”

“Hahaha!” Shantian Jiu laughed loudly, but there was not much humor to his laughter. It was completely a taunting laughter. “Do you think that I am the same kind of idiot as my younger brother?”

“...” Shantian Wu.

However, the gap between the two brothers was indeed very wide. One was a prodigy, while the other was comparatively mediocre. One had long since advanced into the fourth severance, while the other had just barely advanced into even the Severing Mundane Tier, and basically would not have any hope of advancing further than that.

Thus, Shantian Jiu had enough confidence to be proud.

Ling Han wanted to make a move. Though the tournament was about to begin, suppressing this kind of character was only a matter of raising his hand for him. However, before he managed to, he saw a staff member run over, and say, “The tournament is about to begin, come quickly to draw your lot!”

With this interruption, Ling Han also dismissed the thought of making a move, and followed the other into the arena.

“Brother!” Shantian Wu called out defiantly. Not only did this brother of his call him an idiot, he even allowed Ling Han to enter the arena. ‘Are you really my brother?’

Yet Shantian Jiu shook his head. Though the Shantian Clan was very powerful, they were nothing compared to Grandmaster Zi Cheng. He did not dare to barge into the arena and wreak havoc.

He humphed, and said, “We’ll go in and take a look, and when he leaves, we can make our move. It won’t be too late.”

Shantian Wu could only nod. In front of this overbearing brother, he could only be a yes-man.

The two of them entered the arena, and began to watch the battles.

The battles on the second day were no longer a battle royale, but an individual spar of one against one. After all, 99% of the participants had been disqualified yesterday, and those that remained behind now were only about 1,000.

They had to be fielded sparingly, or the battles would not last for the consecutive nine days.

After they had drawn lots, the contestants that had won yesterday were divided into 16 areas. Only one person could qualify for the next round from each area, and then they would have to win another two rounds before they could enter into the final rounds on the fourth level.

Ling Han was allocated into the second area, and his first opponent’s name was Tang Feng.

He did not know the details of this opponent, nor did he take it to heart. For someone who was determined to become the ultimate champion, it did not matter what kind of opponent he encountered on his way. They would all be defeated in his hands.

The battles in the 16 major areas began at the same time. Otherwise, they couldn’t possibly end in one day. If everything was drawn out too long, it would seem tedious and boring.

Some battles very soon ended. That was because a great many prodigies from other forces had come to the first level. There was no shortage of king tiers among them. Then, it was natural that they had ended their battles in an instant. But there were only king tiers here, but no emperor tiers. That was because emperor tiers would have to come from at least four-star forces. If they had come here, they would have some privileges, and would not have to battle on the first level.

There were incredibly drawn-out battles as well. Both sides would be locked in a furious exchange of blows, and from the look of things, it did not seem like the victory would be decided in a single day.

Ling Han waited for a while, and then it was his turn.

His opponent had also arrived on the stage. It was a young man whose features were sinister. He was dressed all in blue, with the symbol of a black cauldron woven into his robes.

“Tang Feng, the Holy Son of Black Cauldron Sect!”

“Black Cauldron Sect? The three-star force, Black Cauldron Sect?”

“Hiss, it is said that Tang Feng has the aptitude of a king tier, and can suppress 100 elites of the same cultivation level all on his own?”

“That has to be the case. Otherwise, how could he be considered a king tier?”

This Tang Feng had a big renown, and was recognized immediately by many. Perhaps he had also drawn the attention of many others as well. After all, he was a king tier, and was not someone that they could see at any other time easily.

And in the eyes of the masses, Ling Han naturally became the background whose only purpose was to enhance his display of strength.

On the spectators’ seats, Shantian Jiu also showed a smile, and murmured, “I never thought that this brat’s first opponent would actually be Tang Feng. Then, there is definitely no chance for him to enter into the second round. Even if it was me, I would only have a 50% chance of winning against Tang Feng.”

He was definitely blowing his own trumpet. With his abilities, he would definitely be ending in defeat if he was matched with Tang Feng. Furthermore, it would be a horrible defeat. In fact, it could even be an instant defeat.

Meanwhile, Shantian Wu seemed very excited, and very much anticipated watching Ling Han be defeated. And then, he would make things worse for him, and give Ling Han a good thrashing so that he would suffer doubly both mental and physical pain.

And in yesterday’s positions, Cheng Fengyun and his group were seated in rows. That was because they had all bought through tickets, so it was practically made up of all the original members.

“Young Master Cheng, what do you think would happen today?” Someone actually asked Cheng Fengyun to again provide a commentary, though it was not known whether he had done it deliberately or otherwise.

WIth a shua, all eyes in the surroundings were set on him.

Being looked at by so many people, with Cheng Fengyun’s vanity, he naturally would not be able to shirk the matter. He thought for a moment, and said, “Though Ling Han is indeed not weak, it is clear that Tang Feng is stronger!

“It should be known that those people yesterday had only been a mob who had an empty advantage in numbers, yet did not know how to work together, nor did they have any individual that was particularly strong.

“But it is a different story today. Those that have managed to emerge victorious from the battle royale yesterday can all be considered elites. And Tang Feng... you have heard it too. He is the Holy Son of Black Cauldron Sect, and is furthermore a king tier of the younger generation!

“I dare make the assertion that it would definitely be Tang Feng who would be victorious in this battle, and furthermore, it would be a crushing victory.”

If this prediction did not take Ling Han into consideration, that was really quite logical. A Holy Son that had come from a three-star force might not be able to match an heir from a four-star force, but the gap wouldn’t be too wide, either. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Thus, everyone nodded repeatedly, expressing their agreement with Cheng Fengyun’s opinion.

“However, Ling Han is really very strong; he only used a single move yesterday to defeat over 60 people. Perhaps he, too, is a king tier?” Still, there were others that maintained a different opinion.

“How about we place some stakes?” Someone was deliberately stoking the flames, and turned to look towards Cheng Fengyun.

Cheng Fengyun’s pride acted up, and he declared, “If Ling Han can still make a comeback in this battle, in fact, if he can hold on for only 100 moves, I will eat the chair under my behind!”

“Great!” Those who watched the excitement naturally did not mind the matter blowing up. The spectators all began cheering, seeming as if they were praising Cheng Fengyun. In truth, they were only forcing him into a corner so that there would be no way he could go back on his word.

Cheng Fengyun was filled with confidence. Tang Feng’s strength was definitely guaranteed. There was definitely no problem with his judgement.

As for yesterday? That was because Shantian Wu and his group were too weak!

Everyone’s interest intensified. At first, the victory of the battle between Ling Han and Tang Feng was no concern of theirs, but now that it involved a gamble, their feelings of anticipation soared instantly.
