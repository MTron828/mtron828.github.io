2749 The surrender of a Heavenly Venerate

Yang Zhihe was extremely powerful.

After all, each Heavenly Venerate was a supreme prodigy. This was especially the case since he was someone who had cultivated to the pinnacle in a low-level dimension. Regardless of whether it was talent, knowledge, or willpower, he had reached the apex.

Unfortunately, his opponent was Ling Han.

He was a freak who had extracted the unique power of heaven knew how many realms. Moreover, he had even fused them together to form a core that endlessly provided him with power. This gave him the right to rival Second Tier Heavenly Venerates while still being a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

!!

Moreover, this power was boundless, and it was as if he were a dimension himself. This was the most terrifying aspect.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Yang Zhihe was already giving it his all, yet he was still unable to break free from Ling Han’s suppression.

Everyone watched on in speechlessness. Was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate about to be defeated?

This Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was definitely going to defy the heavens!

“Sweet Lord, so this is my grandpa?” Ling Feifan gasped. He had heard innumerable stories about Ling Han’s strength, yet just hearing about them was far too abstract. Moreover, it was entirely possible that those stories had been exaggerated.

By the looks of things now, however, those stories hadn’t been exaggerated at all! In fact, they had barely described a tenth of Ling Han’s freakish power!

How could a person… be so freakish?

Meanwhile, Yang Xuanlong was rendered completely speechless as he glanced at Ling Feifan. He had initially planned to charge forward and capture Ling Feifan once his father achieved victory. He would then brutally humiliate him.

Now, however, his dreams had been absolutely crushed.

Ling Feifan was indeed weaker than him, yet Ling Han was completely capable of pummeling his father. Thus, if he still dared to act on his impulse, he would truly be asking for a beating.

“Friends, no matter what, Brother Yang is still someone from our dimension. We can’t watch on and allow him to be defeated, can we?” a Heavenly Venerate said. His title was Ancestral River, and he was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

“Mm-hm.” Another Second Tier Heavenly Venerate nodded in agreement.

The internal conflict among them was another matter. Right now, however, this was something that pertained to another dimension, so they had to cooperate.

“Brother An, what do you say?” the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate asked.

Counting Yang Zhihe as well, they had four Second Tier Heavenly Venerates on their side. The other three were doing battle on the Two Realm Battlefield.

An Tayun shook his head, saying, “There’s no need to further exacerbate this conflict. After all, it only started off as a small matter.”

Indeed, this was only a small conflict between three youths. Was there any need to involve so many Second Tier Heavenly Venerates?

“Since Brother An is unwilling to step forward, let the two of us resolve this problem instead,” the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate said. He then strode forward to join the battle.

Another Heavenly Venerate also roared as he soared into the sky.

Upon seeing reinforcements, Yang Zhihe instantly rediscovered his confidence.

At their lofty height, would they still care about the judgment of mere mortals?

So what if they ganged up on their opponent? Who dared to disparage them?

The three Heavenly Venerates teamed up to attack Ling Han.

Ling Han was unfazed. His strength came from his own body, so he was confident in his invincibility.

‘Let’s battle it out!’

He continued to channel the three Heavenly Venerate Techniques, with the core in his body funneling power into him and allowing him to continue the high-intensity battle.

However, the three Heavenly Venerates were no pushovers, either, and they were completely able to rival Ling Han after teaming up.

The battle continued for a month, yet it was still impossible to decide a victor.

“Friends, hear me out, would you? Why don’t you all stop for a moment?” An Tayun said.

The Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the others all nodded in their minds. Ling Han’s strength was seemingly infinite, and they couldn’t see any hope of suppressing or defeating him. Thus, they were better off ending the battle now.

However, Ling Han was unwilling to accept this. After all, Yang Zhihe had wanted to kill his grandson!

Ignoring the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the Four Nights Heavenly Venerate, Ling Han continued to furiously attack Yang Zhihe.

“You…!!” The Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the Four Nights Heavenly Venerate were both infuriated. They had already stopped, yet Ling Han was still shamelessly continuing?

They had no option but to rejoin the battle.

Three months, six months, one year!

The battle between the four Heavenly Venerates was intense and chaotic.

However, the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the others couldn’t compare to Ling Han, who had a power core in his body that endlessly provided him with strength. They were indeed powerful, yet there would eventually come a point where their energy was exhausted. However, there were three of them, so it was entirely possible for two of them to battle against Ling Han while the third stood aside to rest.

In fact, they only needed a short moment. Heavenly Venerates could forcefully extract the power of heaven and earth simply by opening their mouths and breathing. In just a few breaths, they could recover to their peak state.

This was also the reason why Ling Han had been able to battle against Wu Haoyang for hundreds of thousands of years. Their recovery ability was far too quick.

If this continued, they might never determine a victor.

As the battle dragged on, the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the others became increasingly anxious.

Right now, they were invading the Promise City Realm, so elites like them couldn’t leave the front lines for an extended period of time. Yet, three Second Tier Heavenly Venerates had been caught up here, so the situation on the front lines was becoming increasingly dangerous.

The Promise City Realm was indeed weaker than the Martial Crystalline Realm, but not by very much.

“Friend, what condition do you have to stop?” the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate asked, finally yielding to his opponent. In his eyes, nothing was more important than defeating the Promise City Realm.

“Give me Yang Zhihe’s head!” Ling Han said.

“Impossible!” To say nothing to Yang Zhihe, even the Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the others couldn’t agree to this.

Second Tier Heavenly Venerates were the most powerful beings of the Martial Crystalline Realm, so they definitely couldn’t sacrifice one of them.

“Then the only option is to battle!” Ling Han said coldly.

“You’re taking things too far!!” the three Heavenly Venerates roared in fury. They all retrieved their Heavenly Venerate Tools.

Weng, weng, weng!

Three columns of brilliant light soared into the sky. These three Heavenly Venerate Tools consisted of a sword, a broadsword, and a spear.

With these Heavenly Venerate Tools in hand, the battle prowess of the three Heavenly Venerates instantly soared.

Ling Han didn’t hold back, either, retrieving his Divine Demon Sword, whose might astonished the nine heavens.

The four of them continued to do battle, with the three Heavenly Venerates already gaining an advantage. However, it was still impossible for them to suppress Ling Han.

After battling for another 10 years, even An Tayun couldn’t watch on any longer. He flew into the sky, and said, “Ling Han, that’s enough. Otherwise, I’ll have to step in as well.”

They all shared a common goal, and that was to defeat the Promise City Realm. When that dimension collapsed, they would then share the huge opportunity that presented itself.

Ling Han also knew that he couldn’t possibly kill Yang Zhihe with so many Heavenly Venerates opposing him. In fact, his failure was guaranteed as soon as Yang Zhihe decided to flee. It wasn’t that easy to kill a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He pondered for a moment before replying, “Fine, then tell Yang Zhihe to apologize to my grandson. I’ll temporarily forgive him after that.”

Gasp!

Telling a paramount Heavenly Venerate to apologize to a mere Celestial King? And only forgiving the former temporarily?

Yang Zhihe almost went wild with rage. So what if he decided to slaughter 10,000 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? Who dared to reprimand him? Now, he had only attempted to kill a single Celestial King, and he had more so failed at that, yet Ling Han actually wanted him to apologize?

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “Don’t want to? Then let’s keep fighting! I don’t mind at all!”

“Brother Yang!” The Ancestral River Heavenly Venerate and the others looked toward Yang Zhihe, and said, “Please understand the priorities.”

Since Ling Han had already taken a step back, it was now Yang Zhihe’s turn to concede. After all, they each needed to make a concession to resolve this problem, no?

The Four Nights Heavenly Venerate and An Tayun looked at him as well, and it was as if their expressions were saying, “If you don’t agree, then we’ll step in and help you agree.”

Yang Zhihe naturally couldn’t die. However, he also couldn’t act on his own whim. No matter what, defeating the Promise City Realm was still the most important task at hand.

“Fine!” Yang Zhihe said, the veins on his forehead bulging. He had no option but to bow his head unless he wanted to have a falling out with the other Heavenly Venerates.
