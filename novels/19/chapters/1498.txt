1499 Will not yield! Will not submit!

‘I disagree, I will not submit!’

Ling Han stood like a mountain, firm and unyielding.

He could bleed, and his spine could break, but he would not bend.

Everyone was watching. At this moment, Ling Han was undoubtedly all alone, but standing there, he looked like he could look disdainfully down on the rest of the world.

Even if there were millions standing in my way, I would still charge bravely forwards!

At this moment, everyone was moved by his charisma, and a dead silence fell.

“You will not yield? So what!” Zhu Xiu’er stated disdainfully. Putting aside the fact that there were only a few teachers here, even if the Nine Saints themselves had come, which one of them would dare reute her will and object to her actions?

Did they want to deceive their master and eliminate their ancestor!?

“I will just ask this question: who here feels that I have lost?” Ling Han’s eyes swept over everyone, and no one dared to make eye contact with him, all bowing their heads and avoiding his gaze.

“I’m not convinced!” Empress Luan Xing was the first to walk up to the martial arts ring. F***, Zhu Xiu’er dared to insult her beloved; she did not care who was the one throwing the insults; she only had to beat her up! She stared fixedly at Zhu Xiu’er, imperial might and her breathtaking charms intertwined together. Even Zhu Xiu’er lowered her head involuntarily, feeling inferior.

“I’m not convinced, either!”

“I’m not convinced, either!”

“I’m not convinced, either!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, the Rain Emperor, Ding Ping, and the others all walked up the martial arts ring. They were not the only ones; even Zi Chenfeng, the Second in the World, Long Xiangyue, and other such rank three king tiers also leaped onto the martial arts ring.

They only respected the strong; if the victory was based on true strength, there was nothing to be said. However, if it was obtained with such abuse of power, no one would submit. If even that could be allowed, then what was the point of competing in the first place!

A competition had to be fair. Whoever was stronger would rightfully be the winner!

This was a publicly acknowledged truth among king tiers!

“I am not convinced, either!” Another person leaped onto the martial arts ring. This was not a friend of Ling Han, nor was he a rank three king tier. Ling Han didn’t even know him, in fact, but he had spontaneously walked onto the martial arts ring.

“Ling Han should be the winner!”

“Judge again!”

More people ascended the martial arts ring. There were a total of only 900 new students this time round, but now there were already over 100 that had ascended the ring to support Ling Han, and there were more walking onto the martial arts ring. Young king tiers were filled with passion in the first place, and now their fire had been ignited, and could not be extinguished at all.

“Fine, all of you are planning on rebellion?” Zhu Xiu’er asked coldly. “Get off the martial arts ring immediately. I will count to three, if there is anyone still on the ring, I will throw him out of the academy!”

She definitely had that kind of authority. If she wanted to expel a few people, could the Nine Saints even object?

But what she did not expect was that it would have been better if she had not said these words. The moment she announced this, even more people were jumping up onto the martial arts ring.

“Just go ahead and expel me then!”

“If you can’t even ensure this little bit of justice, what meaning will there be to continue staying here?”

“That’s right, if I submit today, this will definitely leave a shadow in my heart. Would I still have hopes of becoming a Saint in future?”

Everyone was saying such.

What had everyone entered into the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy for?

Wasn’t it for the sake of someday becoming a Saint?

Otherwise, a considerable number of them had Saint-level backgrounds, so what need was there to have come all the way here?

But if a shadow was left behind in their hearts, there was no hope of becoming a Saint, and what was the point of staying, then? They had been forced to crawl into a dog’s hole just over a year ago, and which one of them was not filled with resentment? This resentment had completely exploded through today’s matter.

King tiers... could not be insulted!

200, 300, 400, 500, and practically everyone had ascended onto the martial arts ring.

Zhu Xiu’er’s eyes involuntarily turned cold. Since these people were so disobedient, they would just have to be expelled completely. Did they really think they were all that awesome? She smirked coldly, and was just about to speak. Right at this moment, a heavy pressure was felt, causing her to be unable to speak a single word.

“The winner this time is Ling Han!” A voice was heard, like the willpower of the heaven and earth that everyone would accept willingly.

This was a Saint, the Star Sand Saint!

Suddenly, Zhu Xiu’er’s expression was livid. She had never imagined that her own man would actually slap her harshly in the face at this moment, but no matter how displeased she was, how could she dare voice her objection at this moment?

Her status and power were all because of the Star Sand Saint, and the Star Sand Saint merely had to say one word, and she would fall from the apex right down to rock bottom.

Once she had lost the precious position of Saint Missus, she was only a Heavenly Body Tier, and could just barely be called an elite.

The Great Saint had spoken, and no one dared disagree. Furthermore, this was the truth, after all. Ling Han should have been the winner in the first place.

Abruptly, everyone cheered. The Star Sand Saint had made a just judgement, which was equivalent to having supported them, which made them feel overjoyed.

Gu Daoyi’s expression was livid, and all the teachers looked livid as well.

They were the losers in this farce.

“Ling Han! Ling Han! Ling Han!” Everyone was loudly calling out one name, lifting the mood to the extreme.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and waved his hand to express his thanks to all of them.

He did not know if the Star Sand Saint would have interfered in the end if these people had not supported him, but this event did make him feel an even stronger longing for power.

Zhu Xiu’er only had the backing of a Great Saint, and already dared to detain him and deliberately distort the facts in front of countless others. What if a Great Saint was also like that?

What was crucial was that he himself had to be strong.

Ling Han watched Zhu Xiu’er leave angrily, Gu Daoyi walk down from the martial arts ring with a dark expression, and all the teachers leave with sullen expressions. Though this victory had been his in the first place, with how Zhu Xiu’er had created trouble like this, it became he who had offended all the teachers. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Let it be that he had offended them. In any case, he did not expect anything from these people.

Ling Han did not wait for Wei Zhen, and directly returned with Empress Luan Xing and the others to the eighth campus—in any case, this teacher was not pleased to see him, either, so what need was there to wait for him to leave together?

Because they had quietly turned around and left, they were ahead of the rest, and actually did not alert those in the academy. Ling Han headed directly to the library, and chose a new killing formation. If he encountered Gu Daoyi again, he would not give him another chance, and would kill him directly.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, meanwhile, followed Ling Han to the eighth campus. In any case, when cultivators went into seclusion, it would last 80-100 years, at least, so it was all right for her not to be at her own campus for a great many years. It was fine as long as the resources were dispensed as usual.

Ling Han browsed for a long time, and finally decided on the formation that he would choose—the Blood Crow Formation.

This was an extremely high-level formation among Level 15 formations, its might comparable to the peak of the high extreme. If 10 formations were joined as one, their power might not reach the peak of the consummate level, but the middle stage and late stage were still possible.

As long as he inscribed this killing formation, he could put up a fight even against an opponent in the peak of the consummate level, and would not be like how he had been when fighting Wei Zhen, having to use all sorts of tricks, and still only managing to strike him when the latter had had a moment of carelessness.

He returned to his quarters, and entered into the Black Tower. He began to comprehend Dao beneath the Reincarnation Tree, wanting to completely understand this new formation in the shortest time possible.

Seven days later, Wei Zhen led the team back.

The seniors had already long been waiting, but when they aggressively approached, they discovered that Ling Han was actually not present among the returning party. This made them feel as horrible as if they had thrown a full-power punch right into empty air.

As it turned out, Ling Han had left early on.

And subsequently, the news about the final battle between Ling Han and Gu Daoyi had spread as well, including how Zhu Xiu’er had attempted to deliberately distort the facts, how Ling Han had proclaimed that he would not submit, and that the masses had erupted in an uproar in the end. Finally, the Star Sand Saint had personally spoken and set things right.

This caused even the seniors to feel hot-blooded when they heard this. Though a great many people still could not let go of “tradition”, they could not help but raise a big thumbs up for Ling Han.

If it weren’t for the fact that he had that kind of upright heart and iron will, and hadn’t crawled through the dog’s hole on the first day he entered the campus, would there have still been his unwillingness to submit to Zhu Xiu’er’s tyranny? The Great Saint had expressed his stand; was that actually praise for Ling Han’s resistance to an extent?
