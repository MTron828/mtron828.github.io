1269 A Favor

WIth the appearance of the Purple Moon Divine Maiden, the masses could only step back, and give way to this elite.

Xie Donglai stared fixedly at Ling Han, thinking that though he had not managed to obtain the Realm Spirit Stone, the latter hadn’t, either. Furthermore, he had lost to an elite of the Eternal River Tier, so this was an inevitable matter.

After the Purple Moon Divine Maiden had completed the handing over of the funds, Jin Ming personally walked towards Ling Han, handed over a Spatial Sack, and said, “Young Master Han, this is the payment for the auction, totalling up to 365,840,000 True Origin Stones.”

Pu!

Xie Donglai immediately spluttered. Hold on, Ling Han was not a buyer, but was rather a seller?

He earned over 300,000,000, so what did that mean?

That large-sized Realm Spirit Stone was sold by Ling Han. Otherwise, how could he have possibly obtained a profit of more than 300,000,000?

His expression changed drastically, and he felt as if he had received a heavy slap, feeling extremely horrid.

As it turned out, it had been him who had been the ugly person doing all kinds of foolish things to get attention from the very beginning.

He confidently declared that he would get hold of the Realm Spirit Stone to show off his wealth to Ling Han, but Ling Han was the seller of the Realm Spirit Stone! He endlessly raised the bid, but in truth, he was only paving the way for him. And for that reason, he had even offended an elite of the Eternal River Tier.

He was really an idiot!

Xie Donglai did not reflect on himself in the slightest, and only felt that Ling Han was really too despicable. From the very beginning, the latter knew everything, yet chose not to speak a single word, causing him to embarrass himself.

‘Damn! Damn! Damn!’

He was a descendant of the Great General Xie, and possessed the backing of Eternal River Tier. Even if Ling Han was a Level Eight alchemist, so what? Compared to himself, he did not even have the right to pick up his shoes for him!

Ling Han put away the Spatial Sack without counting the amount carefully.

“Young Master Han, won’t you count the sum?” Jin Ming asked smilingly.

“I trust you, sir.” Ling Han smiled as well.

Jin Ming nodded. Though the Gold Origin Auction House had always been known for its integrity, and there had never been any incidents of deceiving their customers, a sum of close to 400,000,000 True Origin Stones was still an astonishing amount. Even elites of the Heavenly Body Tier could possibly be moved by such an exorbitant sum, so it would not be strange if they made a move.

Yet Ling Han trusted him so completely, which caused him to involuntarily feel very pleased. He felt that this young man would have great prospects for the future.

“You are that alchemist?” the Purple Moon Divine Maiden suddenly spoke up, asking Ling Han.

“I am indeed an alchemist.” Ling Han nodded.

“It is said that you are already in Level Eight?” the Purple Moon Divine Maiden asked further.

“Yes.” Ling Han did not speak needless words. In front of this kind of elite, it was best not to play any tricks.

The Purple Moon Divine Maiden looked quite impressed, and said, “Your true age should be less than 50, right? Not only have you advanced into the peak stage of the low extreme in the Sun Moon Tier in cultivation level, you have also reached Level Eight in alchemy. With that kind of achievement, you could probably look down on the entire Immortal Realm.”

‘What?!’

Jin Ming and Xie Donglai both turned pale in astonishment. Their first reaction was that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden must have seen wrongly. How could there possibly be such a young genius of cultivation and Grandmaster of alchemy?

Less than 50 years old?

It was unimaginable, absolutely inconceivable!

Yet would an elite of Eternal River Tier make an error of judgement?

Yet Ling Han’s heart clenched. Elites were elites, after all. He was young, and this was something that was known to all. But when Sun Moon Tiers looked at him, they could only judge that he was less than 1000 years old, and Heavenly Body Tiers could only conclude that he was less than a century old.

Yet the Purple Moon Divine Maiden had further limited his age to below 50. Even if there was only a difference of 50 years, a cultivator in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier would have a lifespan as long as 1,000,000 years. Her perceptiveness was truly scary, to be able to make such a detailed judgement.

“Going by this trend, you may be able to advance to become a Level 15 alchemist within 1000 years. By that time, even I would have to ask you to concoct alchemical pills for me,” the Purple Moon Divine Maiden said.

A Level 15 alchemist?

Ling Han reckoned that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden should be in the high extreme of Eternal River Tier, and that was why she needed a Level 15 Divine Pill.

“Thank you for the praise, Milady. However, if I reach Level 15, I am willing to concoct alchemical pills for Milady without any conditions,” Ling Han said.

“Oh?” The Purple Moon Divine Maiden was astonished. Concocting alchemical pills without any conditions? This was not a small promise.

The higher the level of the alchemist, the higher the price one would have to pay to ask them to concoct alchemical pills, especially from Level Nine onwards. The time taken to concoct alchemical pills would be longer and longer, from a few months to a few years’ time. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Concocting a Level 15 Divine Pill would need around 10 years’ time. That was equivalent to wasting 10 years of his life. The lifespan of 10 years of a Level 15 alchemist, how valuable was that?

Thus, to ask a high-level alchemist to move required a very high price.

Yet Ling Han actually said that he would concoct alchemical pills for her without conditions; this was too generous.

Ling Han continued, “Do you feel curious, Milady? In truth, the reason is very simple. I have a lover who is currently in Milady’s Purple Moon Army. I would like to ask Milady to take care of her, which was why I was so generous.”

The Purple Moon Divine Maiden couldn’t help but laugh loudly. The fact that Ling Han had been so honest, and spoke of his own motives so boldly, had instead earned her favor. She thought that this man was honest, and more importantly, was willing to make sacrifices for his woman.

“Young man, walk with me!” she said.

“Yes, Milady!”

The two of them left. Xie Donglai wanted to follow as well, yet with a casual wave of the Purple Moon Divine Maiden’s hand, he had been thrown to who knew where.

“Young Master!” The two old servants hurriedly chased after that little black dot. Their mission was to protect Xie Donglai.

The Purple Moon Divine Maiden was very curious about Ling Han, and asked him about the matters between himself and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She also understood the grudge between him and Xie Donglai, and couldn’t help but say, “Then just let your little girlfriend stay temporarily in my army. Even if Xie Qian himself came, so what? Who would be afraid of him!”

She spoke these words with much forcefulness, her heroic spirit boundless.

“Thank you, Milady!” Ling Han said sincerely. Before they left the Cloud Apex Planet, it should be safest for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to stay in the Purple Moon Divine Maiden’s army. After he had dealt with the Five Sects, they could return to the Great Ling Empire together, and by then, who would care who was Xie Qian?

“Hold on to this token. I give you special permission to enter into the Purple Moon Army once every month to meet your little girlfriend.” The Purple Moon Divine Maiden tossed a metal plaque at Ling Han.

Ling Han was overjoyed. Even though they could only meet once a month, the barracks of Purple Moon Army had never welcomed any male visitors, so he was really an exception.

WIth a wave of her hand, the Purple Moon Divine Maiden’s figure broke through the space, and disappeared in an instant.

Heavenly Body Tiers were capable of flight, and Eternal River Tiers’ speed was naturally even more amazing.

Ling Han kept the token away, and involuntarily smiled. If she saw him boldly stride into the barracks, just how astonished would the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden be?

However, now that he had money, he naturally would be buying Godly metal without restraint. Additionally, he also had to accumulate comprehension in seclusion to break through to the medium extreme. He once again returned to the auction house, and asked the latter to purchase Godly metal above Level 5 on his behalf.

Ling Han himself was a Level Eight alchemist, and added with the fact that the Purple Moon Divine Maiden seemed to look on him quite highly, this naturally caused Jin Ming to have an even higher opinion of Ling Han. The latter agreed happily with a nod, and even had no plans to collect any payment from Ling Han.

“As a token of friendship,” he had said.

There was naturally no disadvantage to having another friend, so Ling Han naturally accepted the latter’s kindness happily. He first went to meet the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and then entered into seclusion.
