2666 Change of attitude

Ling Han nodded, and cracked a grin. “That’s right.”

The Wang Clan had great power, and their grand elder was even a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Thus, the difficulty of obtaining Divine Metal for the Wang Clan definitely was much lower than for Ling Han. If it were not because of this, what need would there be for Ling Han to cooperate with the Wang Clan? He could concoct alchemical pills himself, and all the profit would be his.

Wang Qianyang considered for a while, and said, “Agreed!”

But he immediately continued, “Divine Metal is too valuable. Young friend, you would have to concoct a great many alchemical pills to exchange for a single piece.”

“I know.” Ling Han nodded. “You can deliver the ingredients to me tomorrow.”

Wang Qianyang laughed. This kind of swift decisiveness in Ling Han’s style was really to his tastes. Suddenly, he had an idea, but after slight hesitation, he reconsidered. ‘When this boy has concocted a few cauldrons of alchemical pills, I’ll consider this again after checking the grade and pill concoction success rate.’

“I’ll take my leave.” Ling Han clasped his hands together. Since the major matter was already decided, there was no further need for him to stay any longer.

“Young friend, won’t you have some wine?” Wang Qianyang tried to urge him to stay.

Ling Han did not speak, and merely signaled at the foot of the mountain.

Only now did Wang Qianyang recall how the abode below them had already been destroyed by the shock wave from the battle between Ling Han and Wang Qianyang, so he could only grin awkwardly, and said, “Please, young friend.”

Only after Ling Han had left did Wang Jiayue walk out.

“Grandfather, why are you so polite to that mad man?” she asked, acting spoiled.

Wang Qianyang revealed an amiable smile. He had always liked this granddaughter. “He has true ability, so he can naturally be mad.”

Wang Jiayue pouted. “He’s just slightly skilled in battle.”

“Hahaha!” Wang Qianyang laughed loudly. He stroked his granddaughter’s head, and suddenly said, “Yue Yue, you aren’t very little any longer, and now you have broken through to the Celestial King Tier, so it should be about time that you consider the matter of marriage, right?”

Wang Jiayue instantly became shy, stomped her foot, and exclaimed, “I have no wish to marry. I want to stay with Grandfather!”

“Silly girl, who wouldn’t marry when they grew up?”

***

Ling Han returned to his own abode, and recounted the events of today to the women, which also made the latter shake their heads repeatedly. This husband was really not the type to let their hearts rest easy. Wherever he went, he would be causing trouble.

The very next morning, as expected, the Wang Clan sent an important character to deliver the ingredients for alchemy.

It was Wang Yangming.

These ingredients were too valuable. What was to be done if there was a robbery on their way here?

With a Ninth Heaven Celestial King’s protection on the way, even if he encountered someone that he could not match, he could still easily and happily escape. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Yangming clearly did not like Ling Han very much. After arriving here, he tossed a Spatial God Tool over to Ling Han and left quickly, as if looking at Ling Han any longer would upset him.

Ling Han naturally would not be concerned. Wang Yangming did not like him, and he, too, did not like Wang Yangming very much, either.

For the sake of Divine Metal, Ling Han began pill concoction.

He examined the ingredients that the Wang Clan had delivered first, and couldn’t help but feel rueful. They were indeed a noble clan; they were very wealthy.

These ingredients were enough to concoct seven cauldrons’ worth of Celestial-King-Tier pills, and according to Wang Yangming, this was only a negligible amount.

A force whose existence was measured in epochs truly had extraordinary wealth.

Ling Han channeled his physique, and time accelerated. In only a few hours, he concocted his first cauldron of alchemical pills.

“Perfect and flawless.” Ling Han smiled. As his cultivation level progressed, it was also an easy matter for him to concoct Celestial-King-Tier pills. Not only could he ensure his pill completion rate, the grade of the completed pills would either be High Grade or Peak Grade.

He continued, and he concocted all seven cauldrons’ worth of alchemical pills in a single day.

Then, he notified Wang Yangming to come and collect the alchemical pills.

Not too long after, Wang Yangming arrived, but his expression was slightly dark.

“Why have you asked me to come?” he demanded impatiently.

“The alchemical pills are completed. You can take them now.” Ling Han tossed over that same Spatial God Tool.

Wang Yangming scoffed. What kind of joke was this? Only a single day had passed, and Ling Han had concocted all the alchemical pills? Did he think that Wang Yangming only knew to ingest alchemical pills, and had absolutely zero knowledge of alchemy?

“Brat, one should be down-to-earth— yi!”

He was just about to teach Ling Han the proper way to behave, but when his divine sense extended into the Spatial God Tool, he immediately released a shocked exclamation because there were indeed seven bottles of alchemical pills inside.

‘This can’t be real, right?’

Wang Yangming hurriedly took out a bottle of alchemical pills, and after removing the cork, his expression was instantly moved.

They were real alchemical pills!

He switched to another bottle. This was real as well; all seven of them were.

Concocting seven cauldrons of Celestial-King-Tier alchemical pills in a single day was amazing.

‘Hang on!’

Wang Yangming looked stunned. Making those seven cauldrons of alchemical pills was indeed theoretically possible, but wasn’t it very normal for the cauldron to explode in the process of pill concoction? Especially in the case of Celestial-King-Tier pills. The concoction process was naturally even more difficult, and the cauldron exploding was an extremely common occurrence.

To successively concoct seven cauldrons, while the good luck for all seven cauldrons was off the charts, with not one exploding… Was there any such coincidence?

Wang Yangming took a deep breath, and then nodded. “Young friend Ling, I have underestimated you previously!” He bowed slightly towards Ling Han as courtesy.

Ling Han couldn’t help but greatly change his opinion of this man. As expected of one who was born in a noble clan. Though it was inevitable that he would have some arrogance, he was able to go with the flow, and his manner was extraordinary as well.

“It’s fine.” Ling Han nodded.

“I will immediately meet with the clan leader. Hehe, I hope we will develop a stronger relationship in the future,” Wang Yangming said, smiling.

Ling Han bared his teeth in a grin. This old geezer had really changed his attitude too much and too fast, which made it hard for Ling Han to adjust to it all of a sudden. He kept feeling that this old geezer had some kind of ulterior motive.

Wang Yangming left, and very soon returned. This time, he brought a great amount of ingredients, enough to concoct 20 cauldrons’ worth of Celestial-King-Tier pills.

Ling Han continued his pill concoction, and he notified Wang Yangming to come again only three days later.

Though Wang Yangming had long since prepared himself, he still got a great shock.

20 cauldrons, not one pill less. This had reached the greatest value theoretically possible.

Wang Yangming was amazed, and left once more with the alchemical pills.

A day later, Wang Qianyang came personally… along with Wang Jiayue. She had already passed through the Nine Deaths Formation, and had become an official disciple of the martial academy.

“Young friend, though I have already had very high expectations of you, to think that still was an underestimation.” Wang Qianyang sighed ruefully.

He thought back to his conversation with Ling Han several days ago. When the latter had lightly said that he could concoct any kind of alchemical pill, Wang Qianyang had not taken it seriously. He thought that it was inevitable that Ling Han would exaggerate, having achieved such accomplishments at such a young age, and had not imagined that not only had Ling Han just told the truth as it had been, he had basically been modest.

Meanwhile, Wang Jiayue’s beautiful eyes were bright as she looked at Ling Han in surprise. She also found out about Ling Han’s various feats in the last few days, and finally knew how amazing this guy was.

In comparison, Ma Yuhai was practically trash.

“Young friend, there are three pieces of Divine Metal here.” Wang Qianyang handed over a Spatial Celestial Tool.

Ling Han naturally would not be reserved; he stretched out his hand and took it. With a sweep of his divine sense, he immediately grinned.

As expected of the Wang Clan, they were truly wealthy. Even for something as valuable as Divine Metal, they could give out three pieces in a single stroke.

“You’ve given too much.” Ling Han was pleased, but still spoke frankly.

Though he had concocted close to 30 cauldrons’ worth of alchemical pills, with the prerequisite of taking 50% of the profits, one piece of Divine Metal was enough for his fee.

Wang Qianyang laughed loudly. “The remaining two pieces will be an advance payment then.”

There was something as good as this?

Ling Han smiled. “Does Clan Leader Wang have some other business?”

Wang Qianyang was pleased. This brat really knew how to read between the lines. “My Yue Yue has reached an appropriate age, and wishes to seek an ideal husband—”

He had not even finished his words when Ling Han interrupted, and said, “I have a brother who has astonishing natural talent in cultivation, and has not yet married at present.”

Wang Qianyang’s face instantly turned dark.
