Chapter 1044: Yielding

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The expression on Yang Xuan’s face clearly indicated that he wanted to retreat. Ling Han was a stranger who had joined in on the battle, so there was no need for him to risk his life to help him.

In any case, the Yang Clan didn’t hate pirates as much as outsiders thought they did.

That was right. The Yang Clan and pirates were indeed mortal enemies. In the millions of years of their existence, the Yang Clan had lost countless clan members to the pirates. However, without the existence of the pirates, would cultivators still need the Yang Clan to protect them? Without the pirates, how could the Yang Clan earn enough income to support their clan?

When all hares were killed, the hounds would be stewed and eaten 1 . This was a concept that even mortal humans knew, so how could the Yang Clan not understand this?

Thus, the Yang Clan only ever sought to protect their own ships. As for exterminating pirates, they had never been proactive or keen to do it. After all, they would be hurting their own interests if they proactively hunted pirates.

Of course, Yang Xuan couldn’t make his retreat when facing the pirate too obvious. Thus, he could only decrease his strength slowly and eventually reveal a flaw, and then finally let Xi Cheng pass him.

Ling Han naturally noticed it, and he sneered in his mind. He then turned to Yang Xuan, and said, “Thank you for helping, Senior. Wife, it’s time for us to retreat!”

Xiu!

Before Yang Xuan could even reply, he pulled Shui Yanyu into the Cloud Piercing Shuttle with him and immediately soared into the sky.

“Thick face, I’ll come to slap you again some other time!” Ling Han didn’t forget to tease Xi Cheng as he left.

Xi Cheng seethed with rage and violently leaped up, reaching a height of almost 300 meters. He wanted to jump onto the Cloud Piercing Shuttle and pummel Ling Han into the sea. However, once the shuttle was activated, its speed would be four times that of ordinary Sun Moon Tier elites. That being the case, how could the enraged Xi Cheng catch up to them?

Xi Cheng fell from the sky and landed in the sea with a loud plop.

“Sh*t! Sh*t!” He cursed loudly as he trained his gaze on Yang Xuan. If this person hadn’t blocked him, how could the detestable little brat have had enough time to retrieve his Flight God Tool and escape?

‘F*ck!’ Yang Xuan swore in his mind, and even cursed Ling Han as well. It was clearly that brat who had caused such trouble, so why did he have to be dragged into it? Although he had been locked in battle with Xi Cheng just then, they had merely been preventing each other from intervening in the other battles. At their cultivation level, who hadn’t cultivated for millions of years, and who didn’t value their own life immensely?

However, Xi Cheng only cursed for a short while before charging toward Yang Xuan. Flames of rage flickered in his eyes.

He, an elite at the Sun Moon Tier, had actually been slapped by a junior cultivator at the Mountain River Tier. How could he not be furious?

Ling Han circled around the ship once before casually flying off into the distance.

Shui Yanyu pointed at Yang Xuan, and said, “That person is so shameless!” She appeared extremely angry.

They were helping the Yang Clan, yet the Yang Clan actually allowed the pirate elite to attack Ling Han. This left her extremely disappointed.

“Heh, it’s fine when you get used to it.” Ling Han didn’t think much about what had just happened. Most people only cared about their own benefits, so how could he expect a complete stranger to sacrifice his life for him? Anyhow, his aim hadn’t been to help the Yang Clan anyway. He was merely here to kill some pirates.

Shui Yanyu remained angry for quite a while. She had lived in the Imperial Capital her entire life, so it was no surprise that her mindset and experiences were nowhere near Ling Han’s.

After a while, she suddenly shuffled over, and said, “Close your eyes.”

“Why?” Ling Han turned around to face her.

Shui Yanyu was slightly irritated, and said, “I told you to close them, so just close them!”

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll fly at random and crash the shuttle?” Ling Han asked with a chuckle.

“Are you going to close your eyes or not?”

“Fine. If wife wants me to close them, I’ll close them!” Ling Han shut his eyes and immediately sensed a shadow moving toward him. Then, a pair of warm and soft lips pressed onto his lips.

‘Mmm...?’

Ling Han was slightly astonished. ‘Shui Yanyu actually kissed me?’

Although Shui Yanyu was charming and naturally seductive, her personality was actually quite cold and aloof. Even though Ling Han had been hugging, kissing, and groping her this entire time, she had always been passively receiving it. However, she had taken initiative to kiss him now... Strange!

He immediately opened his eyes, only to see that Shui Yanyu’s eyes were shut. Her face was flushed red as she clumsily kissed him.

She was clearly in heat, with her breathing heavy and her neck an alluring shade of pink. This pink stretched all the way to her jade-like chest, though it was a shame that her chest was hidden by her clothes, hiding her stunning body from him.

“Wife, have you finally decided to have kids with me?” Ling Han asked a mood-killing question. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shui Yanyu rolled her eyes at him. She was feeling excited after recalling how Ling Han had slapped Xi Cheng across the face just then—what Mountain River Tier cultivator could slap a Sun Moon Tier elite?

Her body would go weak with excitement whenever she recalled that sight, and it was as if some kind of feeling were about to burst out of her body. This made her want to hug Ling Han tightly and give herself to him.

Yet, for some reason, Ling Han was hell-bent on ruining the atmosphere??

“Wife, your kissing skills aren’t up to scratch. Let me teach you.” Ling Han pulled Shui Yanyu over and leaned in for a deep kiss.

“Mmm...!” Shui Yanyu immediately started to moan, and she placed her hands on Ling Han’s chest in an attempt to push that pervert back. However, her strength became weaker and weaker, and in the end, she started to reply fervently as her arms wrapped around Ling Han’s neck.

This man could easily cause her body to heat up in excitement.

“Damn pervert!” she murmured. “I hate you!”

“Why do you hate me?” Ling Han nibbled her earlobe as he played with her breasts.

“I hate you because you caused someone to enter my heart. I can’t forget them no matter what!” Shui Yanyu aggressively bit Ling Han’s shoulder. However, Ling Han’s skin was too thick, and his flesh was to tough, so there was no way she could break his skin.

A rush of emotions surged through Ling Han’s mind. ‘Is this seductive beauty confessing her love to me?’ He cupped Shui Yanyu’s beautiful face, and said seriously, “I’ll definitely treat you well, for all eternity!”

“Humph! You still have two other lovers!” Shui Yanyu said with jealousy.

“Hehe.” Ling Han chuckled guiltily. Although he had three wives-in-waiting—including Shui Yanyu—he had many more lovers in addition to that.

He was smart enough not to continue with this topic, and said, “Let’s swap the position. We’ll go kill some more pirates as well.”

Shui Yanyu was absolutely stunned. ‘This damn pervert actually said something as vulgar and as unrefined as “position” 1 before me? I’m done for... If I really end up with him, will I also become like this in the future?’

The two of them flew around the Star Sea on their Cloud Piercing Shuttle, exterminating all of the smaller groups of pirates. When they came across Sun Moon Tier pirates, however, they would flee into the distance. They came and went as they pleased, and this caused all the pirates to detest them from the bottom of their hearts.

10 or so days passed, and the number of pirates that had died by their hands had already exceeded 100.

Moreover, Shui Yanyu had finally broken through to the medium extreme!

If news of this traveled back to the Scarlet Heaven Academy, it would definitely cause quite a large stir.

Her cultivation speed was indeed much slower than Ling Han’s. However, she had still managed to advance one minor level in only a dozen or so years. This was still an astonishing feat.

Of course, this was partly because she had obtained several Mountain River Stones which sped up the accumulation of her cultivation. This was in addition to the Heavenly Qi Pills that Ling Han had continuously given her, which allowed her to reach the peak stage of the low extreme in an extremely short amount of time.

In the past few days, she had also fought many intense battles, and her own comprehension ability was also fairly outstanding. Thus, she was finally able to achieve this important breakthrough.
