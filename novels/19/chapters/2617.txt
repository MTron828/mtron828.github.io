Chapter 2618: Death of Xu Huan

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han strode forward, drawing on the Regulations of Space as he did so.

Peng!

Xu Huan was still fleeing, yet he immediately crashed into a wall, which sent him flying back.

He was deeply astonished. With his strength as a Sixth Heaven Celestial King, what wall wouldn’t be shattered by him? Moreover, where in the world had this wall come from?

Xu Huan focused his gaze, yet he was shocked to discover that this “wall” was actually Ling Han!

!!

“I truly overestimated you. With such pathetic behavior, you still have the face to live?” Ling Han said coldly. He immediately unleashed a strike at Xu Huan.

“No!” Xu Huan immediately raised the Soul Extinguishing Drum to block this strike. This was a Celestial Tool, so even though he was unable to fully awaken it, it would still be impossible for Ling Han to shatter it with brute strength.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t attack a Celestial Tool head-on. Even though Xu Huan couldn’t unleash the full power of the Celestial Tool, if Ling Han dared to attack it head-on, that would be equivalent to triggering the Celestial Tool to awaken by itself. That would be an extremely foolish move.

He retracted his fist at a lightning speed.

Xu Huan was delighted upon seeing this. He had successfully evaded an attack. Afterward, he would immediately activate a movement technique and cause his speed to increase fourfold. At that time, Ling Han would be unable to catch him.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han said in an ice-cold voice.

Pa!

Xu Huan heard the sound of bones snapping, after which an agonizing pain shot through his body. He immediately stumbled and collapsed to the ground. Half of his body felt numb and unresponsive.

His pelvic bone had been shattered by Ling Han’s kick.

However, Celestial Kings were Celestial Kings, after all, so how could a broken bone stop them in their tracks?

Xu Huan ignored the pain, with his strong desire to live urging him to use his hands to slam the ground. He instantly shot forward.

At his level, there was no need to limit his attacks or movement techniques to just using his hands or feet, as one only needed their divine sense to channel the power of Regulations.

Xu Huan didn’t dare to even glance at Ling Han. Right now, there was only a single thought in his mind—to escape.

“I’ve already said this many times. If others don’t provoke me, then I won’t provoke them,” Ling Han said calmly. “If others provoke me, however, I’ll repay them with 100 times the fury!”

Pu!

When he finished saying this, he had already caught up to Xu Huan and unleashed a punch, blasting a huge hole into his back.

“You… actually… dared!” Xu Huan said in a quivering voice. This punch had directly obliterated his heart, causing a severe wound. However, even more fatal than this was Ling Han’s martial intent that was causing chaos inside his body. Xu Huan’s divine sense was nothing before this martial intent, and the demise of his mind was imminent.

This was his doomsday.

“My father will definitely kill you! Kill you!” he bellowed. He then crashed to the ground, his eyes wide open.

In this place, Celestial Kings were worth as much as dogs. What did it matter that he was a Sixth Heaven Celestial King? What did it matter that he was the descendant of a Heavenly Venerate?

Ling Han retracted his fist, and swept his gaze over the seven remaining people.

Pa, pa, pa!

They all fell to their knees, trembling in terror.

“Please don’t kill me!” they exclaimed as they kowtowed.

Ling Han was unfazed, and he simply asked, “If I had been captured by you people, would you have let me live?”

The answer was clearly no!

He immediately lashed out.

Pa, pa, pa!

How could Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings hope to block Ling Han’s strikes? Their heads exploded one after another.

In just a moment, Xu Huan and all eight of his companions were killed.

The surroundings were deathly silent. As the spectators gazed at Ling Han, it was as if they were gazing at a corpse.

After all, those nine people had all come from Heaven Transforming City, a city that was guarded by paramount Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Yet, Ling Han had killed their descendants just like that! Indeed, it would have been joyful to kill them. However, just how much trouble would this cause?

Thus, even though Ling Han looked alive, he was, in fact, already a dead person.

In this prison for Celestial Kings, no one could stop Xu Fang and the other paramount Celestial Kings from killing people—regardless of who their opponent was.

However, Ling Han paid absolutely no heed to this. Since he had already advanced to the Fifth Heaven, he was confident that he could escape from the grasp of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Moreover, his strength was advancing each day and each hour, so when he reached the Sixth Heaven, it was very likely that he could even rival Ninth Heaven monarch tiers.

In any case, he felt slightly at a loss as he stared at the Soul Extinguishing Drum.

This was a Celestial Tool that contained a huge amount of Divine Metal. If he allowed the Divine Demon Sword to engulf it, it would definitely take another step toward becoming a Heavenly Venerate Tool. However, it was a shame that this Celestial Tool had been forged by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. In other words, this Celestial Tool would become even more ferocious when it didn’t have a master.

As such, even Ling Han didn’t dare to touch it. Otherwise, he would have to face the might of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Right now, he had no option but to flee if he came across such a powerful being.

‘Forget about it. I’ll collect this Celestial Tool another day,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

It could be said that he had set his sights on this Celestial Tool.

He gazed toward the Ancient Tomb. Right now, at least 90 percent of the Celestial King Graveyard’s Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were inside this place. Perhaps not all of them, but at least 99 percent of them had most likely been affected by the black energy as well, causing them to become bloodthirsty and frenzied. If he entered, he would definitely face great peril.

Even though he knew this, Ling Han was still extremely resolute as he strode toward the Ancient Tomb. He was far too curious. Just what in the world was Desolate Moon scheming?

Ling Han made his way toward the Ancient Tomb, and it wasn’t long before he disappeared into it.

***

Inside the Ancient Tomb, Xu Fang was currently engaged in an intense battle with a black shadow.

He wasn’t alone, and there were several other Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings battling alongside him. Even so, they were still unable to gain an upper hand. This battle was abnormally difficult.

If others saw this, they would definitely exclaim in disbelief. Just what kind of existence was this black shadow? It actually possessed such overwhelming power! Even a team of several Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was unable to suppress it!

Looking closely, however, one would discover that this black shadow was actually confined to a small area. Because of this, it was clear that even though Xu Fang and the others couldn’t win, they couldn’t lose, either.

However, this black shadow was far too quick, and it was impossible to make sense of what exactly it was. Was it a human or a beast? Or perhaps it was a precious tool or some other matter?

At this critical moment, Xu Fang suddenly faltered.

He was clearly the main force of the team, so his sudden falter naturally subjected his team to immense pressure. A Celestial King was instantly struck and sent flying by the black shadow, with a gaping wound appearing on his chest. He had suffered a severe wound.

“Hurry, retreat!” another Ninth Heaven Celestial King immediately exclaimed.

They hurriedly shot back in retreat. Because the black shadow was confined to a small area, it immediately turned around after pursuing them for a short distance.

“Brother Xu, what’s wrong?” the others asked as they turned to Xu Fang.

Xu Fang wore an ice-cold expression as he replied, “My son was killed!”

“What?!” the others exclaimed in deep shock. Who was so audacious? They actually dared to kill someone from Heaven Transforming City?

“Which audacious person was it?”

“Was it the Desolate Moon Alliance or the Seasons Alliance? Or perhaps it was the Ten Thousand Dragons Alliance? They think that they can become enemies with Heaven Transforming City with an alliance of a few Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings?”

With a thought, Xu Fang made a grabbing motion at the void. He then said, “When I retrieve the Soul Extinguishing Drum, I’ll naturally know who the culprit is!”

The others were even more stunned upon hearing this. Xu Huan already had the Soul Extinguishing Drum, yet he had still been killed?

“Even if Nephew Huan was unable to unleash the full might of the Soul Extinguishing Drum, he was still capable of reaching the early stage of the Eighth Heaven, right? That being the case, the culprit at least possesses a battle prowess at the early stage or middle stage of the Eighth Heaven.”

“Far too many people meet this criterion in the Celestial King Graveyard. It doesn’t shrink the pool of people at all.”

“However, no one in the younger generation is capable of killing Nephew Huan. Thus, the culprit is definitely an old and experienced Celestial King.”

As they said this, a small blood-red drum had already shot over from the distance, landing in Xu Fang’s hand. He sensed it slightly, and fury involuntarily spread across his face.

“The person who killed my son… was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King!”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
