Chapter 151: A Shocking Discovery

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

The meat-eating little girl had returned.

“Hug! Hug!” once Hu Niu caught sight of Ling Han, she immediately pounced into Ling Han’s arms, and buried her head into his embrace.

Yi? Yi? Yi?

Ling Han examined the little girl from head to toe, but why did he not find any horns, wings, or anything of the sort? This little girl looked like there was… absolutely no difference from before? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

What was going on here?

After he had eaten two portions of the godly medicine, the first portion refined his flesh and skin, and the second portion reforged his bones. He had practically gone through a complete transformation, and the changes he experienced were extremely distinct. But Hu Niu didn’t show the slightest bit of change at all. If it was just as it looked then wouldn’t it have been a waste of the last portion of godly medicine?

‘No, no, no, no, some changes cannot be seen from the surface. There must have been a great change to the little girl’s body.’

“Sniff! Sniff!” Hu Niu wrinkled her nose, and suddenly, a ferocious light shone from her eyes. With a “teng,” she leaped out of Ling Han’s arms and regained the look of a wild beast. All her four limbs pushed off from the floor, and “xiu,” she rapidly jumped out of the room.

“Aiya!” Ling Han immediately realized that Hu Niu must have used her nose to sense the presence of the Liu sisters.

This little girl was like a wild beast, not only having a very good nose, but also a very strong territorial nature. Now that there were two strangers who had entered into her territory, the little girl’s ferocious character would naturally be roused.

Ling Han hurriedly chased after her.

“Peng!”

In a few leaps, Hu Niu had arrived at her own room. Without any further thoughts, she immediately barged in, and the door was actually easily shattered to pieces by the force. Like a little tiger, she pounced in, her mouth slightly open and her hands formed into claws that could attack at any moment.

“Damn scoundrel, you indeed had evil intentions!” since Liu Ru Er saw Ling Han’s bare upper body, her heart has been beating like a drum and her face was as red as blood. There was no way she would have been able to go back to sleep, so when she heard the sound of the door breaking, she naturally thought that Ling Han’s lust was stimulated and he had come to force himself on her. She instantly bounced up, and struck out her palm in an attack.

“Peng!”

Her palm struck Hu Niu’s body. Though her previous power had dropped to the bottom, after a few days of recovery, her power had already reached the level of Body Refining Tier. This palm strike of hers actually caused Hu Niu to be flung back.

However, she immediately realized that something was off. That was not a huge pervert, or a great lecher she had struck, but rather a little girl.

“Xiu,” Ling Han came in right after, stretched out his arms and caught Hu Niu who had been flung back by her blow.

“Damn, damn scoundrel!” Liu Ru Er could not stop herself from cursing when she saw Ling Han was there. And after such a big commotion, Liu Feng Er woke up as well. Her eyes swept over the scene in front of her, obviously a bit confused about what was going on.

“Kill! Kill!” Hu Niu struggled in Ling Han’s arms, and there was no sign that she had suffered any injury from the blow.

Ling Han was relieved, and said with a smile, “It’s a misunderstanding. The place that the two of you are staying in now is this little girl’s room. She was not here these few days, but has returned just now and discovered that you two have taken over her room, so she thought the two of you were enemies. That’s why she is a little agitated.”

That was not just agitation. She looked like she practically wanted to devour them!

The Liu sisters thought as they took in Hu Niu’s very ferocious appearance. However, this place belonged to Ling Han, so he was the one who had the final say in things.

“Haha, it’s late so we won’t disturb your rest,” Ling Han said with a laugh, and stepped back out. However, there was no way to close the door that Hu Niu had shattered. Never mind, he’d deal with the door tomorrow.

***

After he had returned to his own bedroom, Ling Han pushed Hu Niu down to sit on the bed, and said, “Little girl, those two girls are temporarily considered to be friends, so don’t attack them.”

Hu Niu pouted to show her displeasure. She did not like other living creatures trespassing into her territory, but since Ling Han had already said so, she could only accept it. However, little girls would be little girls, and she quickly forgot about her displeasure. She clung to Ling Han, and said, “Hug! Hug!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and examined Hu Niu closely a second time, yet could not detect any kind of changes on her at all. He felt it very strange.

“That’s not right!”

He immediately shook his head. Hu Niu had sustained a blow from Liu Ru Er just now, but did not suffer any injury at all. There was a definite upgrade to the little girl’s physical body, but to exactly what extent, that would need to be confirmed through continuously increasing the force of attack.

Forget it, he’d just think about it later.

Seeing that there was a faint light in the sky, Ling Han decided not to sleep any longer, and chose to begin cultivation instead.

He sat down cross-legged and began to circulate the Five Elements Heaven Grade Skill. His Heaven Grade Spirit Base trembled lightly, and immediately started to swallow and suck in the Spiritual Qi around him like a whale. After he had taken the godly medicine and upgraded his bones, flesh, and veins, the speed at which he could absorb Spiritual Qi had also increased quite a bit.

It was not that his Spirit Base had become more powerful, but because his veins had become cleaner, which naturally allowed Spiritual Qi to flow through his veins more smoothly than before. This would also have the effect of increasing the speed of his cultivation.

Of course, this was also due to how awesome his Spirit Base was. Otherwise, after absorbing so much Spiritual Qi, if he could not manage to refine it into his own Origin Power in time, what would be the point?

At the end, he swallowed an Ancient Clear Pill to further speed up his cultivation.

Hu Niu watched him for a moment before getting bored, and imitated him in sitting cross-legged.

Ling Han immediately felt something was off. Because there had suddenly appeared the eye of a hurricane next to him that was absorbing Spiritual Qi, and fighting with him over the Spiritual Qi around them, causing his cultivation speed to drop drastically in a single instant.

His eyes snapped open and saw how Hu Niu was sitting cross-legged in a very serious manner, and there was actually a solemn expression on her little face.

‘Ya!’

Though he was already sure, he was still very shocked when he confirmed the fact with his own eyes.

…Hu Niu actually awoke her own Spirit Base and had officially stepped onto the path of a cultivator!

How inconceivable. This little girl was so young!

Typically, one would only awaken his Spirit Base at about eleven or twelve years old. Even if one managed to awaken his Spirit Base early, that would be one or two years earlier at most. However, this little girl awoke her Spirit Base seven or eight years ahead of time. Moreover, based on the extent she was snatching away the Spiritual Qi just now, Hu Niu’s Spirit Base was definitely Heaven Grade, and could even be a match for his own.

One had to know that his Spirit Base had all five elements, and was one of the top-rated even among Heaven Grade Spirit Bases. Then what was the little girl’s Spirit Base?

Ling Han concentrated his divine sense into his eyes, and used a sliver of the spiritual power he had retained from his last life to gaze into Hu Niu’s Dantian.

‘What?!’

Ling Han felt a sudden pain in his eyes, and quickly turned his head. He rubbed his eyes with his hand and actually found traces of blood on his hand. But he did not bother about this now, because he was still astonished by what he had actually witnessed just a moment ago.

‘Was that real?’

He saw Hu Niu’s Spirit Base, but was that really a Spirit Base?

Ling Han felt this was inconceivable, and his entire body experienced a coldness that came from a layer of cold sweat.

…In Hu Niu’s Dantian, that Spirit Base was actually a slumbering person!

That was a magnificent beauty, and though her eyes were tightly closed, causing her beauty to pale quite a few shades, she was still disturbingly beautiful. Even Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan seemed to pale in comparison with this sleeping beauty.

There was no mistake. It was definitely that magnificent beauty that was absorbing Spiritual Qi, and her efficiency at absorbing Spiritual Qi was not the least beneath him.

Ling Han had never seen such a Spirit Base that could actually take the form of a human being!

But this was not what caused him to feel cold. When he had been staring at this magnificent beauty, her eyes suddenly snapped open, and a terrifying killing intent actually sliced to him through his own divine sense. If the black tower had not trembled slightly at an appropriate time, most likely, he would not just suffer his eyes bleeding, but have his divine sense completely obliterated.
