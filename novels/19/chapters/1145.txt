Chapter 1146: Gathering of Prodigies

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After appeasing Hu Feiyun and getting her to cultivate, Ling Han took Shui Yanyu to the side.

The first thing he did was give her a passionate kiss. They hadn’t seen each other for over two years, and he truly missed this beautiful and bewitching woman.

Shui Yanyu tried to break free at the start, yet her body quickly went limp. She collapsed into Ling Han’s embrace, and her beautiful face flushed a deep shade of red. Her eyes were as seductive as could be.

“Don’t...” She wanted to push him away, yet at the same time, she also wanted to stay in his embrace.

“Wife, you’ve been poisoned! This poison can only be cleared away if I sleep with you.” Ling Han’s expression became serious, and he said, “This poison is called love, and it’s the most potent poison in the world! However, if I don’t sacrifice myself for you, who will?”

Shui Yanyu instantly wanted to roll her eyes. Ling Han was clearly aroused himself, yet he was still trying to find a seemingly legitimate excuse. He was far too shameless.

However, she couldn’t think straight after being passionately kissed by Ling Han, so she dazedly nodded her head. Only after a while did she realize that this was not the place for such things. However, Ling Han greedily kissed her a few more times, causing her to become even more dazed and spaced out. Right now, all she wanted was to be fiercely taken by this male.

“I love you!” she murmured.

“I love you too.” Ling Han moved his fingers dexterously, and Shui Yanyu’s enchanting naked body quickly appeared before him. He dragged a finger across her jade-like body, completely igniting up her flames of lust.

“Love me!” Shui Yanyu wrapped her arms around Ling Han’s neck.

She hadn’t seen her lover for two years, and she had been especially worried about him, even though she knew he was definitely safe. After seeing him again, her yearning for him quickly dissolved into flames of lust that seemed as if they wanted to swallow Ling Han whole.

“Darling!” Ling Han passionately kissed this seductive beauty. He wasn’t going to stop at just a taste this time. He was going to turn her into his woman.

“Han, be gentle,” she said in a barely decipherable voice.

“I will...”

He passionately thrust inside her.

Ling Han and Shui Yanyu lay among a field of flowers. Shui Yanyu was cuddled up in Ling Han’s lap, a satisfied smile on her face.

“Baddie, you were only... in a rush to do me because you actually want to marry Her Majesty!” Shui Yanyu couldn’t help but pinch Ling Han after hearing him explain his situation with Empress Luan Xing.

Ling Han hurriedly shook his head, and said, “That was something between you and me. It had nothing to do with others! Wife, you’re so beautiful and enchanting, and I’ve already held back for so long. Weren’t you afraid that I would be so pent up that I became sick?”

“D-damn pervert!” Although they had already become one, Shui Yanyu still couldn’t endure Ling Han’s teasing. Her face instantly flushed red.

Ling Han’s lust was instantly aroused when he saw her embarrassed and seductive expression.

“Mmm!” They were cuddled together, so how could Shui Yanyu not detect his little buddy’s movements? Her eyes instantly widened.

“Wife, it’s time for round two!”

Ling Han laughed loudly as he pressed Shui Yanyu under his body. Then, he started to launch a new round of attacks.

***

Once, twice, thrice...

This was Shui Yanyu’s first taste of lovemaking, so she naturally couldn’t get enough. Meanwhile, Ling Han was also intoxicated by this seductive beauty, and it seemed as if he were going to forget all matters and lose himself in pleasure.

The two of them only concluded their passionate lovemaking experience after three entire days.

They finally exited the Black Tower, yet Hu Feiyun was already full of complaints. She had been cultivating under the Reincarnation Tree, where one day was equivalent to one year. Moreover, she had cultivated for five days straight, and she had almost gone crazy from boredom. She shouted that she wanted to go out.

Ling Han shook his head. Who would’ve thought that Empress Luan Xing also had such an innocent and ditzy side to her? What would it look like if such kind of personality was displayed by the empress?

He was extremely eager to see it.

After exiting the Black Tower, Shui Yanyu immediately started to move out of her old residence. She was naturally going to move in with Ling Han. That way, she could cultivate in the outside world during the day, thereby absorbing the Spiritual Qi and increasing her Origin Power. At night, she would enter the Black Tower and comprehend the great dao under the Reincarnation Tree, thereby increasing the speed of her cultivation as much as possible.

Ling Han could keep three followers, yet he had only taken one so far. Thus, it was entirely possible for him to let Shui Yanyu into his palace to cultivate—as long as no one snitched on them, Shui Yanyu wouldn’t need to relinquish her identity of an ordinary disciple, either.

Shui Yanyu’s main focus was on cultivation, while Ling Han’s main focus was on alchemy.

He needed money.

His Divine Demon Sword was still only a Level Three God Tool, and he needed to elevate it to Level Four, Level Five, and so on. However, that would require a countless amount of Level Three and Level Four Godly metal, and purchasing them would cost an astronomical amount. Ling Han did indeed have a lot of True Origin Stones, yet it was still far from enough.

The highest level pill he could refine right now was the Mysterious Azure Pill, with each pill being able to sell for several thousand True Origin Stones. As for the ingredients, he had already planted them in the Black Tower. It wouldn’t be long before he could harvest them, and this would greatly reduce his expenditure.

However, Ling Han wanted to refine pills of even higher levels. This was because refining a cauldron of higher-level pills would take around the same time, yet the profit that he could make would increase significantly.

In addition, he definitely had to leave enough time to cultivate, and thus it was extremely important to pick the right type of pill to refine.

Of course, he still hadn’t obtained any higher-level pill recipe yet, so he naturally had to stick with refining the Mysterious Azure Pill.

Ling Han regretted not asking Empress Luan Xing to command the Alchemy Institution to make a copy of all of their pill recipes for him. If he had done that, he would have been able to slowly study and digest the recipes.

It was a shame that he and Empress Luan Xing hadn’t been on such good terms at that time.

Anyhow, this didn’t matter. It wasn’t as if he wasn’t going to return to the Joint Peace Planet.

Knock, knock, knock.

Someone was knocking on his door.

Fan Ru hurriedly went to answer the door. He returned after a while, and he handed an invitation to Ling Han. “Young Master Han, this is an invitation for you.”

Ling Han accepted the letter and skimmed over it. A few seed-level prodigies were hosting a gathering where they would enjoy some tea and discuss their understandings of dao. This gathering would take place tomorrow afternoon, and all seed-level prodigies at the Mountain River Tier were welcome to attend. They had all entered the sect for quite some time now, yet they still had yet to properly gather together.

“The timing is just right. They didn’t do this just to suit me, did they?” Ling Han said with a smile. He had obliterated Gan Shiyun’s God Tool, and he had even taken the remains as his spoils. This woman definitely wouldn’t let this matter slide.

“Hehe, there are six people who have formed five Mountains and Rivers, and this is a great opportunity for me to see just how strong they are.”

The next day, Ling Han confidently strolled toward the mountain peak by himself.

This gathering was held atop the White Frost Peak. This peak was exclusive to seed-level prodigies, so it was impossible for key disciples and ordinary disciples to come and spectate their battles—no matter how much they wanted to.

The White Frost Peak was especially tall, yet this kind of height was nothing much to cultivators at the Mountain River Tier. Ling Han was only walking at a “strolling” pace, yet he still arrived atop the peak in just an hour’s time.

“Please show your invitation.” This peak was extremely spacious, and there were two young men standing by either side of the entrance. Their auras were quite powerful, yet they could only stand guard at the gates.

They were probably someone’s followers, though they seemed quite remarkable for mere followers. One could imagine just how powerful the seed who they followed was.

Ling Han handed his invitation over. One of the young men looked over it, and a hint of earnestness instantly appeared on his face. “Oh, it’s Young Master Han! Please enter!”

The peak was filled with stones of all shapes and sizes—these stones were probably seats. Right now, most of the stones were already taken. Ling Han looked around, and he saw a couple of familiar faces.

Shao Sisi, Su Jing, Du An, Quan Lixuan, the Rain Emperor, and Ding Ping!

The last two clearly didn’t recognize Ling Han. They hadn’t heard his name yet, so they naturally wouldn’t think that he was Ling Han. They merely glanced at him before retracting their gazes.

Another few people arrived after him. There was Xia Wuque, and there was also the ditz in Hu Feiyun. There was also... Gan Shiyun!

She glared at Ling Han once she arrived, a baleful and frosty aura emanating from her body.
