Chapter 478: Small Black Temple

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

The blood-sucking bugs covered the entire sky as if stirring up a locust plague; however, they ate not crops, but fresh blood!

The bug-tornado swept over, and instantly, several corpses drained dry were tossed out; no one could stand a single exchange of blows.

Such a combination wasn’t simply summing up their power, but an exponential increase, reaching infinitely close to the Flower Blossom Tier!

The leftover martial artists were greatly shocked, unleashing their ultimate life-saving moves as Spirit Talismans were torn and law decrees fired out. These were originally used when contending for the most valuable treasures, but now, in order to save their lives, they couldn’t care possibly care.

Without their lives, all was over.

Hong , in an instant, the side of the human martial artists had imposing momentum; no matter how close the bugs were to the Flower Blossom Tier, the Spirit Talismans created by those in the Flower Blossom Tier could parallel, and the Spiritual Infant Tier law decrees could directly annihilate, Flower Blossom Tier warriors.

These blood-sucking bugs obviously weren’t king tier beasts and couldn’t possibly withstand such a violent bombardment; the entire swarm of bugs was almost instantly extinguished.

Weng , a blood sucking bug the size of a human head flew waveringly out from the “tornado.” Its wings were somewhat tattered, it was barely able to fly.

There was actually still one that slipped through the net?

“It’ss probably the king of the swarm,” Ling Han said. It was precisely the arrival of this bug king that changed the swarm’s battle style; earlier, infinite blood-sucking bugs acted on their own, but it gathered all the bugs together, and battling under its command, their power increased by several levels.

However, it was also precisely because it gathered all the bugs together that it gave everyone the chance to make a clean sweep, escaping narrowly.

The ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier!

This bug king’s strength was overbearing enough, and secondly, it was enveloped in the center and received relatively less damage, saving its life.

The bug king stared at everyone with hateful eyes, yet didn’t launch an attack, and instead fluttered its wings to fly higher, running away.

“Think you can escape?” Everyone sneered, firing attacks one after another. Instantly, Sword Qi and Saber Qi stormed over, slashing towards the sky. However, the bug king was at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier after all; it opened a black shield and blocked everyone’s attack, continuing to fly higher.

Once it reached a certain height, everyone could only stare blankly. After all, if one didn’t enter the Flower Blossom Tier, there wasn’t much one could do against opponents that could fly.

The bug king looked coldly at everyone. These humans annihilated its subjects, it would definitely come back again and kill all of these humans... It wouldn’t be long before it reproduced a large amount of descendants.

It retracted its gaze and fluttered its wings again, searching for a safe place to rebuild its swarm army.

Shua, shua, shua, a flash of Sword Qi struck, emitting resplendent light!

The bug king first regarded it as beneath its attention; at such a height, no one could harm it. However, the instant it struck, it knew that it was gravely mistaken. With a pu , the Sword Qi slashed through, and its already broken wings were instantly completely severed.

It looked shockingly at that human below, absolutely unable to believe there was such a stunning and peerless sword! It could no longer maintain its flying posture, falling straight down from the sky.

Ling Han smiled faintly and sheathed Demon Birth Sword.

“Kill!” Everyone charged out, and with a few hits, the bug king was killed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Unfortunately, although it was at the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier beast, it was dirty and disgusting; no one held any interest in its flesh. So, after confirming the bug king’s death, no one looked at it again.

They all looked at Ling Han as that sword attack just now made them all shiver inwardly. The bug king flew so high, yet Ling Han’s Sword Qi still harmed it. Although the wings were the most fragile, it still made everyone greatly astonished.

Ling Han walked to the side of the bug king and sliced open the bug king’s body with his sword. Looking at it briefly, he saw the beast had no bones, so it naturally wouldn’t have any bone patterns, while its wings and shell had nothing of the sort.

As expected, this wasn’t a king tier, since it didn’t have bone patterns.

Everyone departed one after another, having great interest in this place and wanting to explore to the bottom of it all.

This place was very strange. They clearly came up from the first layer, but one side was now a golden wall, as if they’d come to one side of the divine temple. However, such a large place defied reason to begin with, so more strangeness wasn’t strange at all.

Since there was only one direction to go, the three followed behind everyone, advancing forward.

After walking for about twenty minutes, a building suddenly appeared before them. Its shape was exactly the same as the golden temple’s outside but much smaller, probably only three meters high. It was also completely black, with only one entrance.

Everyone halted. The sudden appearance of a building naturally made people want to charge in to have a look.

However, this place was quite strange, and everyone was worried about the danger inside. No one was willing to stand out, being the first person to enter.

Weng, weng, weng, a strange sound rang.

Ling Han’s expression instantly changed as he said, “Not good, there’re still blood-sucking bugs here!”

When his voice fell, a black cloud flew out from within the temple, as if to cover the sky and hide the earth, sweeping towards everyone.

“Not good!”

Everyone cried out. When they fended off the first swarm of bugs, they already used all of their trump cards, but now there was another wave... what could they do?

The swarm of bugs already stormed over as everyone hurriedly defended; they couldn’t simply wait for their death.

With only a moments effort, everyone retreated one after another. The swarm of bugs was much larger than the previous one and everyone’s strength dropped, so they could only fight whilst retreating.

“Go, let’s go into the temple!” Ling Han decided not to retreat but instead advance.

In this relatively narrow space, they could weaken the advantage the swarm of bugs had in numbers.

The three entered the black temple. There was only one layer and it was quite empty. In the middle area, there was a stone table with someone’s remains, which was now only a pile of bones, on top.

Was this an offering used to pay respects to gods?

What was that bug swarm all about?

“Master Ling, don’t you space out!” Yue Kai Yu shouted loudly. He and Guang Yuan were battling fiercely, but Ling Han was actually entranced by the remains, making their pressure instantly increase drastically.

“A bloody battle can increase your strength,” Ling Han said smilingly. He walked with large strides to the side of the remains, but without going near, he felt an indescribable pressure as if it were going to shatter his entire body.

How terrifying!

Ling Han revealed a shocked expression. The remains were definitely not ordinary when their owner was alive—at least a Shattering Void Tier existence. That was the only explanation why he’d feel as if his divine sense was being cut by swords and sabers.

It could even be a God Tier being!
