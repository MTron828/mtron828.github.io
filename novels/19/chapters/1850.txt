Chapter 1851: Old bastard

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Really just name the price?”

“Go ahead,” Lu Xianming said, similarly with a smile.

Though he was an alchemy prodigy, he also had outstanding accomplishments in martial arts, and was a king tier himself. But he speculated that he was far from Ling Han’s level in martial arts. Thus, he was of a mind to recruit him.

If this kind of prodigy was working for him, his status would be even more secured.

In a contest among Holy Sons like them, they were allowed to make a move on each other, but it definitely had to be between equals in cultivation level. Otherwise, if they breached the rules of the sect, not only would their status as Holy Son be stripped, they would even be executed.

A contest was a contest, and rules were rules. They were not allowed to mess around.

Ling Han was invincible among his peers, so before he ascended to the apex, the former could become his absolute helping hand.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Then I won’t be greedy, either. For example, Celestial King Tier techniques, give me 10. As well as Source Powers, the likes of Five Elements, Slaughter, Time, just give me one of each.”

Lu Xianming’s initially smiling expression immediately turned green, and he also felt humiliated and angry.

‘Are you joking with me?’

Celestial King Tier technique?

How could a four-star force possibly have a Celestial King Tier technique? And 10 at that?

And there was Source Powers too. That thing was even rarer than Celestial Kings, and to offer one of each? ‘Why don’t you just fly while you are at it?’

People said the price asked for was as high as heaven, while the offering price was as low as the earth, but Ling Han’s first offer was really so high that he could not even open his mouth. Even if he bargained the price down to one Celestial King Tier technique and one Source Power, so what? Was he able to pay the price?

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “You can’t even satisfy such low requests? Sigh, forget it, I had best ask others.”

He stowed away the stuff on the ground, and grabbed a piece of roast meat while he was at it. With a wave of his hand, he strode off.

...If it was not for the fact that he had eaten their food, and screwed them over too, he couldn’t be bothered to involve himself in this kind of murderous enmity.

How could it be that Lu Xianming was an absolute good guy?

Looking at his figure that gradually disappeared from sight, Lu Xianming and his subordinates finally relaxed. After all, Ling Han was really too strong. With him there, they felt as if there was a stone weighing down on their hearts, and felt greatly pained.

“Young Master, this person is too arrogant. When we return, should we find a few people to...” one of his subordinates said, making a slicing motion with his hand.

Lu Xianming swept a stern look on him, and darkly said, “No matter what, he has still saved our lives, so how could we return kindness with ingratitude? Do you all think that my life is worth just that little bit?”

“We dare not!” The seven guards all half-knelt reverently. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

‘When we next meet, I hope you will not refuse me again.’ Lu Xianming withdrew his gaze, and recovered his confident and calm composure. With a wave of his hand, his eyes were extremely grim and solemn. “Let’s go!”

Though he wanted to be kindhearted, the ambush this time had caused his heart to completely harden.

The contest of heirs was destined to be irreconcilable!

He could not afford to be merciful any longer, or he would only be giving up his own life.

***

Ling Han was very pleased. Though he seemed to have a knack for attracting trouble, he had also obtained a large pile of Star Stones and Godly metal because of it, which made him very happy.

Humming a tune, he suddenly felt an incredibly strange feeling, like even his heart was sinking.

“Kaka, lad!” Amidst a series of cackles, an elder appeared by his side. He was really very old, appearing to be in his seventies, all his hair gray, and more than half of his teeth missing too, looking like he was close to death.

However, Ling Han did not dare to think that the other party was weak in the slightest bit. He had a feeling that his elder was even stronger than Commander Guan.

Commander Guan was already a fifth secret elite, and a fifth secret elite that had walked out from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier-level force at that. Then, this elder... definitely had to be in the Ascending Origin Tier!

“What advice do you have for me, Senior?” Ling Han was not able to flee. The other’s Qi had completely locked down on him. Once he had the slightest intention to flee, the other man would definitely move without the slightest hesitation. And even in that instant when he dodged into the Black Tower, he would not be spared.

The Ascending Origin Tier was too strong; they were the strongest beneath Celestial King Tier!

The old man laughed loudly, clapped a hand on Ling Han’s shoulder, and said, “Lad, your temperament is really steady. If any other person was scared like this by me, they would probably either turn around and flee, or be shivering with fear.”

“Hoho, thank you for Senior’s praise!” Ling Han frowned slightly because he realized that when the elder had clapped his shoulder, some unknown Regulations had also been sent into his body.

It was definitely nothing good.

The elder withdrew his hand, and said, “What I have sent into your body is named Black Murderous Curse, and is my unique trick. Without me dispelling it for you, even if several hundred Ascending Origin Tiers made their move together, it would be useless.”

He crooked his finger a few times, and Ling Han’s expression immediately changed. He could feel his heart shrink suddenly and harshly, as if a net was tightly wrapped around it, squeezing it so hard that he felt incredible pain.

Ling Han was internally furious, but he did not panic, and darkly asked, “This junior thinks I have not done Senior any offense, so why has Senior planted such a technique on me?”

“Kaka, I want you to do something for me, but fear that you will not do your best, so I can only use some means first to prevent you from forgetting.” The elder cackled. When one had reached a height that he had, he naturally would not be concerned about the attitudes of others. If he did not like anyone, he only had to erase him.

Of course, he presently wanted Ling Han to do something for him, so even if he disliked him, he would temporarily tolerate him. For a mighty figure like himself, this kind of patience was not a big deal.

Ling Han’s heart calmed. Since he wanted him to do something, then he temporarily wouldn’t be in any danger. He asked, “May I know what Senior wants me to do?”

“Steal something,” the elder said smilingly. “My name is Blood Shadow Demon, but the majority call me Old Demon Blood Shadow, and I, too, like this name. Hehe, I am only an old demon.”

Ling Han was speechless. This old bastard did not feel this was an insult at all, so even if this insult was thrown into his face, it was useless.

“What do you want me to steal, and where is it?”

Old Demon Blood Shadow looked at Ling Han admiringly. “If it was not for the fact that I am so determined to obtain that item, I really could not bear to have you take the risk, brat. So calm and composed, I would really like to treasure your talent.”

He paused slightly. “There seems to be something in your body, brat... Forget it, proper business is more important!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel his heart clench. Ascending Origin Tiers could not discover the existence of the Black Tower, the Nine Heavens Flame, and the likes with a single glance, but upon direct skin contact, they would immediately discover something was off. Thankfully, the old bastard was more anxious about stealing something. Otherwise, should he carefully examine in closer detail, he would at least be able to discover the Nine Heavens Flame and Xuanyin Source Water.

Those were Source Powers, and even Celestial King Tiers would be tempted. The old bastard would definitely kill him without the slightest hesitation, and take them for his own.

“I want you to enter into Alchemy City, and steal the two Natural Peach Seals there for me.” Finally, Old Demon Blood Shadow announced his demand.

“...” Ling Han.

This was really too much of a coincidence, wasn’t it?

Ling Han wanted to achieve fifth severance, so he had to obtain the Natural Peach Seal. Otherwise, once the heavenly tribulation struck him, there would be absolutely no way he could survive.

And so coincidentally, the old bastard wanted him to steal the Natural Peach Seal.

Moreover, Ling Han had just encountered the Holy Son of Alchemy City, and now the old bastard wanted him to sneak into Alchemy City.

“Senior has probably witnessed that farce previously, right?” Ling Han asked smilingly. The old bastard should have no idea that he, too, wanted to get the Natural Peach Seal, but must have seen those three sneak attackers attempt to assassinate Lu Xianming.

The admiration in the Old Demon Blood Shadow’s expression became more pronounced, and he said, “So the child can be taught!”
