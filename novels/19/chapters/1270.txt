Faceless plucked the strings of his qin even faster.

Weng, weng, weng!

Melody reverberated through the air, and bursts of sound waves transformed into countless weapons that shot at Ling Han. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The sky was almost blotted out by the tsunami of weapons. Their cold glints intertwined, creating an extremely harrowing scene.

However, Ling Han was unafraid. He had advanced one minor level, and his physique had also elevated to the toughness of Level Seven Godly metal. Even if he faced the attack of a consummate level cultivator head-on, he would at most spit two mouthfuls of blood.

Moreover, his opponent had suppressed his cultivation to the middle stage of the medium extreme. Thus, even if he possessed a battle prowess of six stars, it would still be incredibly difficult for him to injure Ling Han’s physique.

Peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han launched a flurry of attacks and shattered the onslaught of sound wave attacks. He drew closer and closer to Faceless.

Faceless appeared slightly astonished. When battling at the same cultivation level, his opponent was actually this powerful! However, this also stirred his fighting spirit. His hands became a blur as more sound waves surged from his qin. They didn’t transform into sabers, swords, axes, and spears this time, instead gathering to form into a giant human.

The giant measured 30 meters in height. It was dressed in a full suit of armor, and it held a massive ax in his hand. However, upon closer inspection, this giant was actually a corpse that had already shriveled to become a skeleton. Ignis fatuus[1] burned in its empty eyes, releasing an eerie and sinister chill.

Upon appearing, the skeletal giant immediately raised its ax and charged at Ling Han. At the same time, the armor on its body started to glow, surprisingly forming streaks of divine patterns. This skeletal giant appeared incredibly realistic.

‘It’s merely formed with sound waves, so why does it feel so real?’

However, Ling Han was unfazed, and he met the skeletal giant’s attack with his fist.

Peng!

His fist collided with the skeletal giant’s ax, releasing a devastating shock wave that instantly surged into the surroundings, crushing the land and causing a huge amount of damage.

However, this was a stretch of desolate land to begin with, so it mattered little how much they damaged the surroundings.

What was astonishing was that the skeletal giant was actually able to block Ling Han’s attack.

Ling Han hadn’t expected this. The skeletal giant was merely formed from sound waves, so how could it possess such powerful might?

‘As expected of a king tier. Their abilities sure are astonishing.’

Ling Han laughed loudly as he continued to exchange blows with the skeletal giant. Streaks of divine patterns appeared on his fist and arm, and his battle prowess instantly surged to another level. He threw several more punches, and the skeletal giant was finally shattered into pieces.

However, Faceless simply plucked his qin a few more times. Another skeletal giant materialized and charged at Ling Han.

‘Again?’

Ling Han shook his head. He couldn’t stay passive and allow Faceless to attack him at will. He activated the Star Plucking Step, escaping from the skeletal giant at a blinding speed before dashing at Faceless.

“Hmm?” Faceless was slightly surprised. He hadn’t expected Ling Han to possess such tremendous speed. However, this didn’t faze him. He extended his arm, and surprisingly drew a thin sword from his qin. He immediately thrust the sword at Ling Han.

He had hidden a sword in his qin and caught Ling Han completely off guard.

Ling Han had no time to adjust his attack, so he immediately took a deep breath before exhaling forcefully.

Hu!

He instantly floated back like a falling leaf.

Shua!

Faceless’ thin sword swept past the tip of Ling Han’s nose. If it were an inch closer, it would have sliced Ling Han’s nose clean off. Even if it hadn’t sliced his nose off, it would have still drawn blood.

Meanwhile, the skeletal giant had already arrived behind Ling Han. It viciously swung its ax at his back.

Faceless naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity slip, and he immediately charged at Ling Han from the front. This placed immense pressure on Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng!

Faceless and the skeletal giant launched a flurry of attacks at Ling Han, one from in front and one from behind.

‘Just as I expected, he’s incredibly powerful!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

This was the first time he had become so disheveled in a battle against someone at the same cultivation level. However, although they said this was a battle at the same cultivation level, Faceless was actually one sub-minor level above him. Moreover, Faceless had only suppressed his power. His grasp and application of Regulations were still at the pinnacle level.

Thus, there was still a gap between their abilities—a relatively big one, at that.

However, did fair battles truly exist in the world? If one possessed weaker cultivation than their opponent, who dictated that their opponent had to suppress their cultivation level? Faceless was already being extremely generous by suppressing his cultivation level.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t complain, either. However, since his opponent had drawn a weapon, he also wouldn’t hold back anymore. He roared as he unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword.

Murderous aura instantly soared into the sky.

The Divine Demon Sword had elevated in quality and become a Level Six God Tool, and thus its might had naturally soared to a new height. A wisp of heaven’s might also flowed through it, and this more so induced fear into one’s heart. Ling Han swung the sword.

Pu!

The skeletal giant was instantly sliced into two halves. Sword’s might coursed through it, and the two halves of its body violently exploded into pieces. It was unable to withstand even a single attack.

“Brilliant sword!” Faceless didn’t forget to praise the Divine Demon Sword as he slashed his own sword at Ling Han.

Ding!

Their swords collided, releasing a dazzling divine light.

Faceless’ sword was a Level Eight God Tool, yet it was completely unable to suppress Ling Han’s Divine Demon Sword. Faceless had nurtured his sword himself, and thus it contained his martial intent. Coupled with its two-level advantage, its might wasn’t weaker than that of the Divine Demon Sword. However, it was still unable to gain an advantage.

Ling Han’s Level Six Divine Sword was just as powerful as Faceless’ Level Eight Divine Sword—this was simply incredible. It was no wonder that Faceless was interested in the Divine Demon Sword.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Faceless was definitely one of the most powerful king tiers of the younger generation. His battle prowess was absolutely terrifying.

He had grasped higher-level Regulations of heaven and earth than Ling Han, while Ling Han had a freakish physique and recovery ability. Thus, the former possessed a stronger offensive ability, while the latter possessed a stronger defensive ability. As a result, neither of them could gain the upper hand.

However, if this battle continued, Ling Han would definitely emerge the final victor.

This was because his defensive ability was passive and something that would remain forever. Meanwhile, Faceless would be wounded if he lost concentration and accidentally allowed Ling Han to strike him.

“Hahaha!” Faceless laughed loudly and pulled out of the battle. “I can’t defeat you if we battle at the same cultivation level.”

“I can’t defeat you, either,” Ling Han said.

“If we genuinely battle at the same cultivation level, you’ll definitely defeat me,” Faceless said. “After all, I can only suppress my power. My grasp of Regulations is still far stronger than yours.” Faceless was completely honest about this.

“However...” He paused for a moment before continuing, “We were only sparring just now. If that were a life-and-death battle, it’s hard to say who would have killed whom.”

Ling Han nodded in agreement. Could prodigies like them not have trump cards?

For example, he still hadn’t activated heaven’s might yet. Moreover, even if he were severely wounded, he could still circulate a drop of Indestructible True Fluid and instantly recover. In fact, he even had a one percent chance of rising from the ashes.

Of course, his strongest trump card was still the Black Tower. If worse came to worst, he could simply hide in the Black Tower. If he did so, even Saints wouldn’t be able to do anything!

The two of them felt like they were old friends, even though this was the first time they had met. They decided to sit down and discuss dao. Although Faceless possessed a higher cultivation level, Ling Han’s thinking was fresh and bold. It gave him quite a lot of inspiration.

Meanwhile, Ling Han also received a lot of inspiration. The reason for this was simple—Faceless possessed a higher cultivation level than him!

The two of them became more and more enthusiastic, and they ended up speaking for an entire three days. However, they still felt unsatiated. They felt as if they could discuss dao for another seven or eight days.

“Heh, I’ve finally found you!” A voice that was dripping with hatred suddenly traveled over. Ling Han and Faceless looked over, only to see Xie Donglai walking over with his two elderly servants behind him. There was also a middle-aged woman.

Zhu Liyun!
