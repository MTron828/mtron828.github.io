Chapter 1684: Jiang Wushang

A big shot among peak stage Saint Kings was actually insta-killed.

Ling Han withdrew his fingers, smiled calmly, and declared, “Jiang Wushang, come out and meet me!”

All the mountain bandits exchanged looks, and the remaining several deputy chiefs all had menacing expressions as they declared, “We move together. Kill the man and capture the woman alive!”

Though they could feel that this was problematic, none of them could bear to kill the Empress. If such an exquisite beauty were to die, that would really be a great pity.

However, there was no need for them to be so polite towards Ling Han!

Boom, at least a few hundred mountain bandits leaped up, and launched an offensive against Ling Han.

They had used their full strength, and multiple silvery rivers appeared, stars forming and destroyed within them. Multiple Regulations appeared. After all, these mountain bandits had all reached the Genesis Tier; those that did not manage this were not even qualified to join them.

“Die!”

The Empress humphed, and her nine doppelgangers appeared, releasing various powerful techniques. Divine light burst out and dazzled the entire valley, and every streak of light was fatal and deadly.

Ling Han moved as well. Boom, a ball of flame burst out from within his body. It was like the flames of extermination, and was also like a cleansing flame that could cleanse all darkness and filth to welcome a new world.

The Nine Heavens Flame!

As Ling Han’s cultivation level increased, the might of the Nine Heavens Flame had also become gradually stronger. This was one of the Nine Great Ancestral Flames of the Celestial Realm, so how domineering was it?

Boom, as the Nine Heavens Flame rolled out over them, the mountain bandits only managed to release a terrible scream before they were immediately burnt into ashes one after another. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Flee! Flee for your lives!”

It was only a few attacks, and all the mountain bandits’ faces turned green as they all turned around and fled.

This couple was practically like demons, and could not be matched!

“Virtue has its reward and evil has its retribution, this is the natural cycle of karma!” Ling Han’s hand stretched out, and the Nine Heavens Flame wove a giant net above the valley, stopping every single mountain bandit from fleeing, while he and the Empress stood guard at the only land passage into the valley. They were planning to block their retreat and destroy them.

“We’ll give it our all!” The mountain bandits’ eyes had all turned bloodshot, and they charged back.

This time, they no longer went easy on the Empress, and even she became a target of their frenzied attacks.

Compared with their lives, so what if she was an exquisite fairy?

They were all desperate criminals, not romantics.

Unfortunately, the power gap was really too wide, so even if they gave it their all, so what?

This was a one-sided massacre, and neither Ling Han nor the Empress showed them any mercy. Ling Han despised these mountain bandits for their various acts of evil, and the Empress considered everyone else below her notice. Aside from Ling Han and those connected to Ling Han, any living being in this world was the same to her, as if they were only stray dogs.

Killing these mountain bandits was just like killing a few ants to her, so what need was there for her to feel any kind of emotion?

This massacre only lasted for 15 minutes, and all the mountain bandits were executed. Even the several deputy chiefs collapsed at the first strike.

Pa, pa, pa, pa. And it was at this moment that a round of applause was heard. A scholar dressed in black walked out of a bamboo house. His complexion was very fair, and his features were very delicate. He appeared to be in his thirties.

“Jiang Wushang?” Ling Han asked.

“That would be me.” The black robed scholar nodded, and appeared to be very bookish.

Ling Han was slightly surprised. As he saw it, the leader of this band of vicious and fierce mountain bandits should be a coarse, rough barbarian. No matter what, he could not connect that image with this cultured scholar in front of him.

“Judging by your strength, I should not be able to survive this disaster today. However, before you make your move, I hope that the two of you can listen to my story.” Jiang Wushang bowed towards the two of them.

Ling Han was also quite curious himself, and said, “Please go on.”

Jiang Wushang gathered his thoughts for a while, and then said, “Actually, I cannot be considered a cultivator. I have always been engrossed in the research of ancient history, and married a gentle, beautiful wife, who birthed me an adorable son. Though I have always been praised by others to be talented in cultivation, I truthfully disliked the acts of violence and murder very much.

“However...”

He paused, and fury burst from his eyes. “I went out one day to discuss the missing parts of history with a friend, and when I returned home, I discovered that my wife and son had both died!

“I almost went mad, and after I calmed down, I found a great many people going by the few clues that were left, and only then did I find out that it was a profligate son of the Ding Clan that coveted my wife’s beauty, and wanted to use force against her. My wife would rather die than bend to his will, and was beaten to death by his hands. To vent his fury, he even threw my son who had only been three years old then and killed him.

“I went to seek my revenge, yet was unable to even enter through the main doors of the Ding Clan before I was beaten half dead. I was thrown outside the city, and allowed to rot so that only bones would remain.

“At first, I was definitely dead, but the heavens spared me. A sweet fountain actually erupted from underground, and healed my injuries.

“I know that the Ding Clan is too powerful, and I would not be able to avenge myself ever in this lifetime. Hence, I became a bandit, and if any group of traveling merchants came out from Dark Moon City, I would eradicate all of them to make some trouble for the Ding Clan.”

This...!

Ling Han sighed internally. Jiang Wushang’s experience was indeed very tragic and pitiful, but for the sake of causing some pain to the Ding Clan, he had killed who knew how many innocents, and who knew how many women had suffered the same fate as his wife.

This man’s heart had already been completely distorted by his vengeance.

Ling Han paused, and said, “You are already a peak stage Saint King, and your talent is extraordinary. Why did you not attempt to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier? At least, you would have a sliver of hope of getting your revenge.”

Jiang Wushang stared at the skies, and showed a gentle smile. He answered, “What I cannot bear to part with the most is my love towards my wife and son, but if this first severance of Severing Mundane Tier is dealt, I would have to sever this love of mine. In that case, I would rather remain incapable of getting this revenge.”

Severing Mundane Tier, dealing a strike onto your own self to sever the mortal bond that was most important to you. But mortals were mortals because they could not let go of various things, so how could this strike that separated mortality and immortality be dealt so easily?

Jiang Wushang was undoubtedly a sentimental person. For the sake of not forgetting the love for his wife and son, he did not even attempt to break through to the Severing Mundane Tier, and even abandoned his vengeance.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Jiang Wushang, your crime is too heavy, and I have no choice but to kill you. However, I can promise you that there will come a day that I will eradicate the Ding Clan and give you justice.”

Jiang Wushang laughed loudly, and said, “Whether the two of you are able to succeed or not, I will first thank you! This is my final battle, so allow me, a person who despises battle, to have a brilliant fight, and bring an end to my life after I have given it my all.”

He gave a light shout, and a frightening aura surged out of his body, strong enough to make even a peak stage Saint King tremble.

“When I was in the Eternal River Tier, I had formed 6,000,000 stars. If it were not for the fact that I really had no interest in cultivation, it was possible that I could aim for 8,000,000 or even the pinnacle of 10,000,000 stars,” Jiang Wushang stated calmly. “Thus, the two of you must not be careless. If you were killed by me, hoho!”

Ling Han gave the Empress a look, and said, “I’ll be the one.”

Though Jiang Wushang’s crime was heavy, he could still be considered a man, so it should be he who sent him on his final journey.

The Empress nodded gently, and stepped aside.
