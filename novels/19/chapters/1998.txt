Chapter 1999: Driven away

By this time, even as proud and arrogant as Yi and the Empress were, they had no choice but to admit that Ji Wuming was indeed strong.

This kind of strength had already surpassed the range of the fifth severance, and no matter how much of a prodigy you were, you could only be left speechless.

He was a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

The Empress and Hu Niu immediately went to Ling Han’s side, and Yi also strode over. The four of them stood side by side, facing Ji Wuming.

Any one of them was a supreme monarch tier, but against Ji Wuming, they had no choice but to join forces. In fact, it was not even guaranteed that they could win should they join forces. On the other hand, as long as none of them got killed, that would already be considered a victory.

The gap was too big.

Ji Wuming made no further moves. Instead, he stared for a while at Ling Han and his group, a smile appearing at his lips. “You all make me recall how I was when I was young. The me of that time should have been the same as you all.

“However, in front of the survival of the Celestial Realm, what would your few lives be worth?

“Do not begrudge the injustice. Who knows how many people have sacrificed themselves for your sake, and what grudges did they bear?”

As he spoke, Ji Wuming drew out a small bow that was only about the size of a palm.

Minor Heavens Complete Bow!

This was a real Celestial Tool, and accompanied with Ji Wuming’s strength that surpassed his cultivation level, the might that could be displayed was definitely devastating.

“Ji Wuming!” A furious shout rang out, and a figure with a tall build appeared. He was like a human-shaped bear, about three meters tall, and the width of his chest and back made him seem like a massive boulder. He was standing there with the upper half of his body bare.

He roared furiously, and had already charged towards Ji Wuming. Boom, a punch blasted out, the brilliance radiating far and wide.

Ji Wuming frowned slightly, and murmured, “You fled when you shouldn’t have, and came when you shouldn’t!” He shifted the direction of the bow, and shot an arrow straight at that human-shaped bear.

Xiu

, the bow was tiny, and the arrow it shot out was also tiny. It turned into a streak of light that looked like a golden needle.

The human-shaped bear clapped his hands in front of him. Pa, the two giant hands joined together, instantly creating a frightening hurricane that blasted towards that streak of light.

Xiu, the hurricane met the streak of light, and they both shone with seals of great dao. This was a clash between two people, or rather the clash of the Regulations of human and Celestial Tool.

The human-shaped bear was immediately sent flying. He similarly was no match for Ji Wuming, but his strength was truly amazing, and he had not been insta-killed by Ji Wuming—now, as long as he could withstand a few blows from Ji Wuming, he could be considered an elite, a true elite, an elite that was on the same level as Ling Han and his group.

“Madman!” Yi bared his mouth in a grin. “I have deliberately come this time to meet you.”

“You will get the chance!” The human-shaped bear did not even bother to look at Yi, his eyes only fixed on Ji Wuming. “However, it’s not your turn yet!” His fighting spirit soared, his eyes shining brilliantly, countless seals gushing.

Ling Han also glanced at this human-shaped bear. So this was the Madman, the strongest in the Severing Mundane Tier of the Three Capitals Heaven.

And now, they, five great monarch tiers, would join forces, but would they be a match for Ji Wuming?

Ji Wuming lightly tapped the bow on his body, and said, “Here’s another. This is slightly troubling.”

Five great monarch tiers, and they were all top grade monarch tiers at that. In his eyes, they were actually just slightly troubling.

“However, this does save me the effort of finding you all one by one!” He broke into a grin, and with a flash, he took the initiative to launch an offensive against Ling Han and the others.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ji Wuming changed his tactic, and was no longer indifferent and careless. Instead, he entered into a crazy battle mode. That was not the slightest bit inferior to Hu Niu, Yi, and the Madman. His black locks rose to the skies, and forcefully barged into the circle formed by Ling Han and the others, causing violence and havoc.

He was probably the only one in the Severing Mundane Tier that would dare to face these five great monarch tiers in a full-on confrontation.

However, a change in number would cause a qualitative change. Ling Han and his group were all top monarch tiers, and now with another Madman, this had increased their battle prowess by another level. Furthermore, the five of them were working together now, no longer fighting alone, so it was natural that their might would greatly increase.

They blocked Ji Wuming’s tsunami wave-like attacks, but that was all that they could do. They were not able to launch a counterattack.

“Now!” Ling Han suddenly shouted loudly.

“Niu knows!” Hu Niu replied, and her whole person suddenly vanished, and the shadowy image of the Roc that floated above her head suddenly became incredibly real. An ancient, incomplete seal appeared on her forehead, and suddenly a majestic light was released.

Xiu

, this light was aimed directly at Ji Wuming.

Fast, too fast. The seal had just only lit up, and the majestic had already fallen onto Ji Wuming.

Peng, a bang resounded, and Ji Wuming was instantly sent flying. A hole shockingly appeared on his chest, with blood gushing out, and his face had become astonishingly pale.

The battle had progressed this far, and Ji Wuming was finally wounded. Furthermore, it was a serious wound at that. Even his heart had been destroyed.

This was Hu Niu’s strongest trump card, extracting the brand of Celestial King martial intent inside her body to stimulate the bloodline of the Roc to launch a world-shaking attack capable of erasing even Heaven Soul Tier elites.

However, though Ji Wuming had suffered a serious injury, his strength could still be seen from this. An attack that could even kill a Heaven Soul actually only inflicted a serious injury on him, and he had not died.

The reason why Ling Han did not allow Hu Niu to use her strongest trump card all this while was so that it could show an extraordinary effect at this kind of moment.

“Charge!” Ling Han and the others launched a fierce offensive.

Ji Wuming humphed, swept an eye over the faces of all five of them, and then he suddenly turned around and left.

His speed was too fast, as if the water pressure here did not have the slightest effect on him. With a single step, he was already several thousand meters away, and in a few steps, he had already disappeared without a trace.

There was absolutely no way that they could catch up to him.

Ling Han and the others all frowned. Which one of them was not an ultimate prodigy, but even the five of them working together were only capable of driving Ji Wuming off. This was something completely unacceptable to their prideful hearts.

“We will battle again after breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier!” The Madman was the first to leave.

Yi nodded as well, and went in another direction.

Though they had strength that could match a Dividing Soul Tier, in essence, they were still not Dividing Soul Tier elites, and once they broke through to the Dividing Soul Tier, not only would their battle prowess soar, they could also gain even more abilities.

For example, one could have another doppelganger with every additional minor level in the Dividing Soul Tier. This would definitely affect one’s battle prowess immediately, and would be incredibly notable.

Since they could not match Ji Wuming now, then they could just battle again after breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier.

Prodigies were always unwilling to admit defeat.

“We have to hurry up too,” Ling Han said to the three women. He had thrown Bewitching Maiden Rou out of the Black Tower.

The four of them continued their advance, but they did not dare to swim deeper. The water pressure here had already reached the limits which they could withstand. If they swam even deeper, they would not die, but they would have to exert more power on defense, which would naturally affect their battle prowess.

Moreover, the marine creatures in this zone were already strong enough. If they went deeper and encountered Heaven Soul or even Immortal Palace Tier-level marine creatures, what could they do aside from fleeing?

They launched a hunting spree in this expansive ocean, and as time passed, the Yang Soul Stones they accumulated became more and more.

Half a year later, they each had a green Yang Soul Stone that was the size of a human head.

Ling Han and the others did not content themselves with this kind of Yang Soul Stone. Instead, they continued their hunt, but wanting to advance green quality to blue quality would need 200 times the effort. It would more or less expend all the time they could spend in the Yang Soul Ocean.
