1570 The Third Elder

A golden path appeared, and it brought along with it a powerful elite. It was a man who looked to be around 50 years old. He had a solid build, and his purple hair billowed in the air even though there was no wind.

This person was far too powerful, and the Demon Masters couldn’t help but tremble under the influence of his aura.

“Earth Demon!” the Overlord Sword Demon Master and the others exclaimed.

Earth Demons were equivalent to Great Saints, and they possessed the ability to easily suppress Small Saints or Yellow Demons.

“Greetings, Senior!” The Demon Masters all greeted the Earth Demon. This was a supreme elite, and he would be invincible among the dozens of nearby galaxies. His power was undoubtedly tremendous and unfathomable.

“Our respects to the third elder!” The four disciples of the Tan Clan were extremely respectful as they kneeled to greet the Earth Demon. In fact, even Tan Feng bowed slightly in greeting. This was even though he appeared older than this Earth Demon.

This supreme elite was called Tan Yun, and he was a paramount elite of the Tan Clan. His title, the third elder, was proof enough of his power.

‘Two Demon Masters in a single clan?’

The Demon Masters were astonished. They had heard the disciples of the Tan Clan referring to Tan Feng as their sixth elder before, and they had initially thought that this was simply a title based on his age. Judging by the current situation, however, they realized that the Tan Clan still had five elders ranked above him, none of whom had died!

Moreover, the third elder was already an Earth Demon, so just how powerful were their first elder and second elder?

What kind of force was the Tan Clan? This was far too terrifying?!

After greeting the third elder, Tan Feng immediately turned around to sneer at the Hysteria Demon Master, saying, “Didn’t you want to protect that brat? Hahaha! Come, come fight us!”

The Hysteria Demon Master wore a dark expression. His hands were tightly clenched inside his sleeves, and there was even the sound of his fingers cracking.

At his cultivation level, it was already extremely rare that one would become enraged. With him being as lofty as a god, who would ever dare to oppose him? However, who could have imagined that an Earth Demon would suddenly arrive? Before such a paramount being, he was as weak and fragile as a young amateur cultivator.

The rank of Demon Master was divided into four stages, and the gulf between each stage was profound. Even the so-called star geniuses could only sigh in dejection before the face of such tremendous gulf.

“Hahahaha!” Tan Feng roared with laughter. It was usually beneath him to act with such haughtiness before juniors, but this time was different. The 17 Demon Masters had actually dared to oppose him, and this had infuriated him to no end.

‘Pei! Who do you people think you are!’

Did these mere ants of the Netherworld know where he had come from? His ancestor had come from the noble Celestial Realm, so just a finger of his was hundreds of times nobler than the sum of these people combined!

“Weren’t you all acting pretty aggressively just then? Hmm? Where’s your temper now?” Tan Feng continued to denigrate them, jabbing his finger at each of the 17 Demon Masters as he spoke. His voice was dripping with disdain.

“Sixth Elder!” Tan Yun finally spoke. His voice was extremely soft, yet it caused Tan Feng to immediately tremble and shut up. Tan Yun paused for a moment before asking, “Where’s the mystery realm?”

“This...” Tan Feng said as he scratched his head. He didn’t know, either. At the time, he had been fully focused on trying to kill Ling Han. As such, he had completely forgotten about the existence of the mystery realm. Upon seeing the look of displeasure on Tan Yun’s face, he hurriedly said, “Third Elder, this brat killed Tan Mo, and he more so obtained a Saint Fruit and Demonic Tools in the mystery realm!”

“Oh?” Tan Yun glanced at Ling Han, and Ling Han immediately felt as if he had become completely transparent, with no secrets able to be hidden. “He’s merely at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier, so how could he have killed Mo’er?”

“He’s able to fully activate a Demonic Tool!” Tan Feng added.

Tan Yun couldn’t help but feel astonished. An Eternal River Tier elite actually possessed the ability to fully activate a Demonic Tool? This was incredible! One had to realize that even Tan Mo hadn’t possessed such an ability. If one didn’t reach the Genesis Tier, there was no way they could grasp such high-level Regulations of heaven and earth.

“Capture him!” he commanded. It was naturally beneath him to target an Eternal River Tier junior himself.

Tan Feng turned around, and he glared at Ling Han as he said, “Does anyone still want to obstruct me?”

“Father!” Zhu Xuan frantically shook the Overlord Sword Demon Master’s arm. If Ling Han was captured by Tan Feng, his only possible fate would be death.

The Overlord Sword Demon Master wore a deep frown, yet he eventually chose to remain silent.

An Earth Demon was present now, so what more could he do? If he stepped forward, he would simply be asking for death. If he were a lone cultivator, perhaps he could still take a gamble. He could grab Ling Han and then flee. After all, the speed of Genesis Tier Demon Masters was around the same.

However, there were other things that he needed to consider, so he didn’t dare to take this risk.

Meanwhile, the Hysteria Demon Master also wore a deep frown. He owed Ling Han a favor, so idly standing by while Ling Han was killed would leave an irremovable thorn in his heart. This would directly affect his Dao Heart.

“Father, save him!” Wu Jue whispered quietly. Although he “hated” Ling Han, that was merely a case of children being bitter and competitive. In terms of serious matters, he was still very clear on where he stood. At that time, it was indeed Ling Han who had brought him back to the Netherworld. He remembered this clearly.

“Hahahaha, a bunch of ants actually dared to challenge a dragon!” Tan Feng sneered. He reached over and grabbed at Ling Han. He was feeling extremely delighted at this moment.

Weng!

A burst of sword light flashed over, and a powerful demonic claw streaked through the air. The Overlord Sword Demon Master and Hysteria Demon Master attacked at almost exactly the same time, blocking Tan Feng’s attack.

“Are you seeking death?!” Tan Feng was wild with rage. The third elder had come, yet these people still dared to resist?

“Elder!” The Hysteria Demon Master clasped his hands in respect as he turned to Tan Yun, saying, “Ling Han killed Tan Mo in a fair battle, so don’t you think it’s unfair to have a Demon Master try to suppress him now?”

“Unfair?” Tan Feng roared with laughter. “What’s fairness? My Tan Clan represents fairness, and my Tan Clan represents justice! Third Elder, please kill these two people to protect the name of our Tan Clan!”

His words were far too domineering! Was the Tan Clan the ruler of the Netherworld? How could they be so wanton and unreasonable?

“Elder!” Ling Han suddenly interjected, shouting, “I’m from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land, and we have 10 elders in our clan. I’ve specifically come to the Netherworld to train, and the elders of my clan definitely won’t let things slide if you dare to target me here.”

He was simply making things up, and he was conveniently shifting blame onto the Eight Stones Forbidden Land in the process as well. However, the main reason for doing so was simply to buy time. Once Small Tower awoke, he would be able to use the Back Tower again. At that time, it wouldn’t matter even if a Heaven Demon or Earth Demon arrived. He wouldn’t be afraid of any of them! In fact, he could even turn the tables and kill them all if he desired to!

Tan Feng involuntarily faltered upon hearing this. There was an expression of slight worry in his eyes as he turned back to glance at Tan Yun.

Just like the Tan Clan, that was also a Forbidden Land. He wasn’t afraid of Ling Han, but he was afraid of the force behind him. If the force behind him happened to be more powerful than the Tan Clan, then that would cause them no end of troubles.

“I’ve never heard of them before,” Tan Yun eventually said. As he blinked, there was the image of tens of millions of heavenly bodies forming and dying in his eyes. His aura was profound and terrifying.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “I’m not a member of the Netherworld. In fact, I’ve come from the Immortal Realm!”

Tan Feng shook his head and exclaimed, “Impossible!”

This person fit perfectly with the Regulations of the Netherworld, so how could he possibly be from the Immortal Realm? One had to realize that he had also attempted to enter the Immortal Realm before. However, the Regulations of heaven and earth that he grasped would be forcefully suppressed and erased. If he stayed in the Immortal Realm for too long, even his cultivation level would start to fall.

Thus, even though it was said that one could open the gates to the Celestial Realm after reaching the high extreme of the Genesis Tier and fusing the Regulations of the two realms, this was actually impossible in practice!
