Chapter 2243: Dripping water penetrates stone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Kuhaad merely twisted his body slightly, using the incredibly tough outer shell to defend against Ling Han’s attack. Meanwhile, he had set his eyes on Liu Sanbian, intending to kill the latter.

Liu Sanbian used all the tricks up his sleeve, yet was ultimately rendered completely helpless. His body was pinned down by Kuhaad, and his brain juices were sucked dry.

“Delicious, really too delicious!” Kuhaad laughed loudly. “After consuming several more of such prodigies, Kuhaad will very soon be able to reach the sixth level of Eighth Lotus.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He continued to move, and this time, his target was the Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan.

The Nine Tigers of the Chang Clan had already stowed the bodies of those brothers that had died in battle into their Spatial God Tool, and now there were five left that were still standing, but faced with Kuhaad, there was no way that they could resist. Very soon, they were all killed, and their Spatial God Tools had also been broken, pouring out countless Spatial God Tools, as well as the corpses of the other four tigers.

Kuhaad sucked dry the brain juices of all nine tigers, and passed judgment. “As expected, it is still the brain juices of a living person that are more delicious. The taste of the dead is slightly inferior.”

His eyes set on Ling Han. “Though you are the weakest, your aptitude is the highest, so Kuhaad left you for last.”

Ling Han took a deep breath, setting aside all his negative emotions. He fixed his eyes on Kuhaad, and declared, “If I do not kill you, then my surname is not Ling.”

“Haha, how are you going to kil me?” Kuhaad pointed at the corpses of Meng Feicheng and the others. “You tried your utmost to save them, but in the end, they have still become my food and fertilizer.

“You can save no one, and that includes yourself!

“Your fate is to become Kuhaad’s food!”

His six limbs danced in the air, and shot towards Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Ling Han used Void Space. Though Kuhaad had flaunted his might, killing what was equivalent to three Fifth Secret monarch tiers, how could that not have come with a price—his power of Regulation had been expended greatly.

Thus, Ling Han merely had to expend a little more of the other’s power, and he would then be able to counterattack.

“Haha, you think you can exhaust Kuhaad’s power? Too naive!” Kuhaad laughed loudly. “How could you possibly imagine the power of our Shadow Race? Even if you exhaust your power of Regulation 10 times over, I will still be full of energy, my battle prowess unreduced.”

“Is that so?” Ling Han asked coldly.

Though Liu Sanbian and the others had all already died in battle, leaving the battle prowess of his side considerably weakened, there was also no longer any need for him to be concerned about others now, and his concentration was fully freed.

‘Hehe, then let us just see who would tire the other out first.’

Ling Han did not speak further, and merely focused on fighting Kuhaad.

His primary focus was evasion and dodging, so his expense of power of Regulation was naturally very small. Kuhaad’s primary focus was attack, yet he was still carelessly expending his power of Regulation, as if it was just like he had said, and the Regulations that were locked in his body were boundless, far surpassing the level of Fifth Secret.

Fight, fight, fight, fight. True enough, there was absolutely no sign of Kuhaad’s battle prowess declining, which was incredibly terrifying.

However, Kuhaad’s heart was not as steady as it had once been.

That was because though Ling Han was on the defensive, there was really too much power of Regulation that he could channel out.

Was this really a First Secret?

Moreover, Kuuhad’s battle prowess was also about to reach a turning point. His Regulations were close to exhaustion, and he was quickly about to go on the decline.

His brow creased in a frown, and he abandoned Ling Han. Instead, he directly pounced towards the Origin Magic Cube.

Ling Han humphed coldly, setting off in rapid pursuit. With him shooting out a fist, Sword Qi danced wildly, slashing out towards the openings in Kuhaad’s outer shell.

“You’ve fallen for it!” Kuhaad did not even need to turn around. His insect leg swept out, stabbing out at Ling Han so fast that it was like a shooting star.

He knew that Ling Han would definitely stop him from retrieving the Origin Magic Cube. Thus, he put on an act of being about to retrieve the Origin Magic Cube, while in truth, he was actually luring Ling Han into moving to stop him, intending to take advantage of the opening to sneak-attack the latter and kill him.

Ling Han smiled calmly, a supreme aura surging over his body. Immediately, his body turned golden as multiple veined patterns flowed out, as if he was a divine being.

Peng!

This blow landed on Ling Han’s body, yet had only pushed him backwards. However, a few slivers of Sword Qi had still slashed into the openings of Kuuhad’s outer shell.

Jade-green blood gushed out, and Kuhaad wore an expression of outrage.

His initial intentions had been to ambush Ling Han and kill him. He had not expected that he would be wounded by Ling Han instead, which naturally made him feel incredibly furious.

“Die! Die! Die!” he roared loudly, his insect legs waving madly, and sending out a terrifying attack after terrifying attack.

Ling Han dealt with each attack as it came, and merely focused on evasion. If he really could not manage to dodge, he still had the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. If it was only him alone, he was really nimble and agile.

After battling for a few more hours, Kuhaad was finally anxious.

His power of Regulation was already seriously insufficient, and his battle prowess was beginning to rapidly decline.

“Isn’t your power of Regulation endless?” Ling Han countered, sending out a punch.?Peng, with a mere tremor, he neutralized an attack from Kuhaad.

Kuhaad really wanted to curse. Because of a difference in race, the power of Regulations locked in his body was definitely several times more than that of any cultivator of the same level in the Celestial Realm. Thus, while he clearly had battled intensely with Liu Sanbian and the others, he was still filled with confidence, certain that he could kill Ling Han as well.

However, the result was completely the opposite. The storage of Regulations of this First Secret cultivator was actually superior to even his!

How could this be believed?

Gritting his teeth, he charged towards the Origin Magic Cube.

Previously, he had laid out a deadly trap for Ling Han, but he was really planning to snatch the Origin Magic Cube and flee this time.

After refining the Origin Magic Cube, his battle prowess would defintiely be raised to a terrifying level. By that time, to say nothing of a minor character like Ling Han, he would be certain of killing the majority of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

This treasure was something that could help one become a supreme elite in a single leap.

Ling Han sniped at him, the Fists of Fury shooting out in quick succession.?Peng, peng, peng, just like drops of rain, they landed on Kuhaad’s outer shell.

“Pointless effort!” Kuhaad smirked coldly. His outer shell was extremely hard. Though it could not compare to Five-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal, it was definitely not something that a First Secret cultivator could pierce through with his bare fists.

Ling Han did not answer, and merely shot out a series of punches madly.

His stamina had already advanced into the level of an Ascending Origin Tier, so the speed of his blows was astonishingly quick. Furthermore, every punch was landing on the same spot.

Kuhaad felt as if he had lost all face, actually being forced to flee by what, in his eyes, was trash of the lowest grade. Thankfully, no one witnessed this scene. He only had to kill Ling Han, and there would be no need for him to worry that this embarrassment would be known to others.

He only lowered his head, and charged towards the Origin Magic Cube. Once he obtained this rare treasure, he would be able to become an 18th Lotus elite not too long after—in other words, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

‘Just blast me as you like. In any case, there is absolutely no way that you can penetrate my outer shell.’

Crack!

A crisp crack rang out. Kuhaad felt a tremor pass through his body, and the latter actually became unsteady.

Looking over, his eyes instantly turned green.

That was because one of his legs had been torn from the force, and only a sliver of blood and flesh was still connected to it. It was hanging from his body, swaying back and forth.

‘This…!’

He couldn’t help but feel incredibly astounded. Ling Han had actually truly managed to pierce his outer shell with his bare hands. Just what kind of monster was this?

Ling Han sent out another punch, hitting the spot where the leg had been torn, and asked calmly, “Could it be that you have never heard the words ‘dripping stone penetrates stone’?”

The power of dripping water was indeed negligible, but with enough time, it could actually pierce a hole in the hard rock.

Ling Han did not have that much time, but he could use the speed of his attacks to compensate for that. Moreover, his attack was much stronger than dripping water.

Blood was dripping from his hand. That was his own blood, but his Godly bones were undamaged.. His vitality was burning to the maximum as a boundless killing intent flickered in his eyes.
