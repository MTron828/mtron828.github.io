Chapter 1659: Return of Great Saint

After throwing off their pursuers, Ling Han had Xiao Gu wait by one side, whilst he entered into the Black Tower.

“Ling Han!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint approached him.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I am going into seclusion for a period of time.”

He came to the Reincarnation Tree, and took out and consumed that Saintly medicine without hesitation. Weng, the great dao suddenly seemed to resonate with him, and he experienced a period of consistent enlightenment.

Godly medicine was a very strange existence. By itself, it basically did not have much battle prowess, and occasionally some were able to release powerful poison, or affect something like space to protect themselves, but even for Saintly medicine, none had ever been able to lay claim to the title of elite.

Of course, Godly medicine had gained awareness, and would also gain intelligence. When they had stepped on the path of cultivation, that was a different matter.

The benefit of Godly medicines was that they were birthed by the heaven and earth, and contained the shards of Regulations of great dao, which would help cultivators comprehend Dao! Of course, increasing the accumulation of Origin Power was also one aspect of it, but it was far less important than the boost to comprehension of cultivation level.

The largest effect of Saintly medicine was comprehending Dao, and now Ling Han’s cultivation level had reached the peak stage of the Medium Saint Tier. He had been cultivating all these days in a place that was abundant with Spiritual Qi, so he had also gained enough accumulation.

Once the doors to comprehension opened, he would be able to break through to the next tier!

Underneath the Reincarnation Tree, as Ling Han refined the medicinal effects, great dao turned into a long river that appeared in his mind. Ling Han continuously comprehended, and spiritual techniques appeared repeatedly, allowing him to float in the long river of great dao.

His accumulation of cultivation level was getting denser and denser, and when 10 days had passed in the outsider world, Ling Han suddenly exited the Black Tower.

...In truth, he had already comprehended Dao for 1,000 years. With the help of the Saintly medicine, he had gained enough appreciation.

Weng, thunderclouds rolled over, lightning dancing amidst them. That scene was enough to make anyone’s hair stand on ends.

Ling Han’s Small Saint Tier tribulation was comparable to Great Saint Tier tribulation, and Medium Saint Tier tribulation was comparable to Saint King Tier tribulation, and now?

The heaven and earth of the Immortal Realm had its upper limits, so it was impossible for the might of the heavenly tribulation to increase without end. At most, it could only reach peak stage Saint King Tier. But if quality could not be improved, then quantity would be increased. Kuang, kuang, kuang. 10 bolts of lightning descended at the same time, becoming 10 giants.

Patterns of great dao were entwined around each giant, and they charged towards Ling Han. Some were wielding lightning spears, while some were brandishing lightning swords, and they launched an unhesitating offensive towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was unafraid. He guided the lightning into his body to temper his Godly bones.

He had a feeling that if he was in the Immortal Realm, this would be the last improvement for his Godly bones. If he underwent the Saint King Tier tribulation here, then the might of the heavenly tribulation would be completely inadequate to push his physique to the next level.

It had to be the might of the heavenly tribulation of the Celestial Realm.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu had been seated by the sidelines all this while. Since Ling Han told it to wait, then it would wait obediently. When it saw the heavenly tribulation appear, it did not have the fear that others would feel, but rather rushed forwards excitedly, seeming to be quite intrigued.

However, as long as it did not disturb the heavenly tribulation, the heavenly tribulation would ignore it as well, which made it very depressed. Why were these lightning giants unwilling to play around with it?

“Xiao Gu, step out,” Ling Han said. He guided the power of lightning, and the Godly bones in his body were currently advancing towards the high level of Level 20 Godly metal. Once he succeeded, his physique would be the sturdiest existence in the Immortal Realm. He would not need to fear even if there were a group of peak stage Saint Kings attacking him simultaneously.

If anyone wanted to wound him, they could only slowly refine him using the power of Regulation.

Xiao Gu gave a “yiyaya”, and left the vicinity of the heavenly tribulation.

Ling Han approached the heavenly tribulation. His Godly bones were already close to Level 20 previously, and after only a while of tempering, a qualitative change took place.

Level 20!

However, Ling Han did not stop, but rather continued to absorb the power of the heavenly tribulation, causing his Godly bones to become even harder, and advancing towards the level of Pseudo Divine Metal.

The so-called Pseudo Divine Metal was slowly built up from the base of Level 20 Godly metal so that it would improve further in quality, using the number of layers to categorize its quality. Building up another two layers would be One Star Pseudo Divine Metal, and going by that calculation, 10 Star Pseudo Divine Metal would be layering 11 pieces of Level 20 Godly Metal as a single layer.

This was not just simple layering, but rather merging them from the essence, where each contained the other. Furthermore, it had to be the melding of different Godly metals. The same type of Godly metal could not possibly be melded together.

After six hours had passed, Ling Han did not temper his Godly bones any longer, because this had already reached the limit. In this space, he could only reach the level of Half Star Pseudo Divine Metal. Half a star, not even a full star.

This was already enough!

He charged towards the tribulation clouds, wanting to retrieve Heavenly Tribulation Fluid.

Immediately, the heaven and earth flew into a rage. One after another, lightning giants at the level of peak stage Saint King Tier appeared, and moved to stop Ling Han from advancing further.

But in front of the present Ling Han, what could they do?

Peng, peng, peng. He was like a heavy chariot rolling over them; the lightning giants would only be crushed into pieces. Though the lightning giants could reform, Ling Han did not take them to heart at all. So what if you had more in numbers? You would simply be crushed into smithereens.

More and more lightning giants appeared, but because they were limited by the Regulations of the Immortal Realm, peak stage Saint King Tier was the maximum. At most, they could only endlessly increase their numbers, yet they had met with a freak like Ling Han. Numbers were completely meaningless in front of him.

‘You cannot break through my defense, so even if there were billions of you, so what?’

He charged into the core of the tribulation clouds. Once again, a sacrificial altar appeared ahead of him. WIthout reservations, he went over and retrieved all the Heavenly tribulation Fluid in the groove.

All of a sudden, the tribulation clouds dispersed.

Actually, half a day’s time had not passed yet, but so what? The maximum limit of their strength could no longer harm him, and even the heaven and earth had no further “interest” to make things difficult for him.

Err, why did he feel like he was a bully?

Ling Han scratched his head. Everyone would be shivering with fear when they spoke of the heavenly tribulation, but in his case? He actually “scared off” the heavenly tribulation before the time limit had been reached.

He landed back on the ground, and released the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, the Notionless Saint, and the aunt and niece of the Long Tribe from the Black Tower. However, the aunt and niece of the Long Tribe were still unconscious. Ling Han shook them slightly with his Origin Power, and only then did they regain consciousness.

“Ling Han, what did you do to me?” Long Yushan exclaimed in shock. She did not know how long she had been unconscious, and she worried that Ling Han might have done something unspeakable to her in this period of time.

Meanwhile, Long Xiangyue’s beautiful eyes shone. She very much hoped that Ling Han had done something to her that he would have to be responsible for.

Ling Han chuckled, and declared, “Come, let’s charge back!”

“Ling Han, I asked you a question!” Long Yushan involuntarily raised her voice when she saw that Ling Han did not answer her question.

Ling Han’s eyes turned cold. Weng, a frightening pressure surged out, and Long Yushan’s legs involuntarily became weak. She actually flopped onto the ground. “I was polite towards you, but you should not overstep your boundaries, either! From now onwards, we will go our separate ways!”

“Ling Han, don’t blame my aunty. She just has a stubborn tongue, but has no malicious intent!” Long Xiangyue hurriedly said.

Meanwhile, Long Yushan was biting firmly on her lower lip. Her personality was a proud one, and she would definitely not yield.

Ling Han shook his head, his demeanor determined.

Though he had gotten a dragon’s horn from the other party, he had also solved an unwanted betrothal for her. Furthermore, he had even become deadly foes with the Open Clouds Forbidden Land because of it. If it were not because he had wanted to kill the Open Clouds King in the first place, who would have settled for that kind of business deal? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He did not owe Long Yushan anything.

‘You can have the temper of a young mistress, and throw your temper around at whomever you like, but I am not going to be the one to bear with your temper.’

He turned around and left. The Notionless Saint and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden ignored Long Yushan as well. They only nodded at Long Xiangyue before leaving, closely following in Ling Han’s footsteps. Only Xiao Gu was a bit confused about the situation. It gave a “yiyaya”, and then ran after Ling Han.
