Chapter 1926: There is a wider world out there

Shut up!

There was actually someone that dared tell Yan Xianlu to shut up to his face?

Hiss, everyone inhaled sharply, an expression of disbelief on their faces.

It was not just one, but two.

How brazen, just who were these two women? But since they had been able to come here, they had to be top-notch emperor tiers. Could it be that they did not have any idea that they had to treat Yan Xianlu very respectfully?

To say nothing of the fact that he was the heir of an eighth heaven Celestial King, he himself was a monarch tier. Was that not enough?

But what was even more shocking to the rest was that after Yan Xianlu had been yelled at, he was actually not angered. He merely shook his head, and looked exasperated.

It had to be that Yan Xianlu, as a gentleman, was unwilling to clash with women.

But it was not everyone that thought this. They looked at Hu Niu. This was a person that they had not seen before—if top-notch emperor tiers like them could not remember even this, then they were really unworthy of being called emperor tiers.

This young girl had come uninvited, and Yan Xianlu actually did not fly into a fury. What was the meaning of this?

“She, she is that demonic girl!”

“Sh*tty girl!”

Someone had recognized Hu Niu. These were the several people that Hu Niu had surpassed on her way. Though there were many paths to the summit, there were quite a number of people here too. Thus, after Hu Niu had chosen one path, it was definite that a considerable number of people would be surpassed by her, and they naturally were terribly scr*wed over.

All of a sudden, at least 10 people set their eyes on Hu Niu, all of them burning with fury.

Though Hu Niu was world-shakingly beautiful, she had a completely different style from the Empress.

The Empress was noble and poised, and thought that everyone in this world should submit to her, exuding a pride that was deeply embedded into her very bones. Hu Niu was wild and wilful, and the little actions that she showed were extremely mischievous. It was like she was a child that had not grown up.

And precisely because of this, Hu Niu did not have as strong a bearing, or as captivating a beauty as the Empress... In truth, if the Empress did what Hu Niu had done, there would probably be very few that could truly become angry with her.

Of course, the Empress was not one to do something so risky.

Hu Niu bared her teeth like a female panther that was raging. “What is it? You guys want to fight?”

Those dozen plus people naturally were even more infuriated. ‘Because of you, we were stomped over by a hundred over manifestations, and you actually do not feel even the slightest bit apologetic?’

“Hehe, everyone, please calm your anger!” Yan Xianlu stepped out, and pressed his hands down slightly. “Listen to me for a while as I tell you about the reason why I have invited everyone here.”

He was probably also very depressed now. If it had been in the past, he definitely would’ve been the center that everyone revolved around. He only had to say one word, and everyone would be attentively looking at him. What need would be there for him to repeat his words multiple times?

But Hu Niu was too strong. Even if he used his ultimate technique, Hu Niu had hers too, and furthermore, it was incredibly terrifying at that. In an instant, she had destroyed thousands of manifestations in a single move. His was far inferior to this.

However, Yan Xianlu was Yan Xianlu, after all. When he said so, everyone had suppressed their anger, at least for the moment.

Hu Niu wanted to glare again, yet Ling Han rubbed her head. Instantly, she showed an expression of enjoyment, no longer bearing a grudge against them.

Everyone clicked their tongues in amazement at this sight. Hu Niu was so fierce, but in front of Ling Han, she was so docile. This was really something that they could not conceive. However, at the same time, they were filled with envy towards Ling Han. After all, putting aside the ferocious nature of Hu Niu, she was still a great beauty that was unmatched in her exquisiteness.

Moreover, in front of Ling Han, wasn’t this exquisite beauty also very gentle?

‘Why is that I can’t find this kind of woman?’

Hu Niu continued her glaring contest with the Empress. With Ling Han on the sidelines, it was definite that they would not be able to come to blows, but the battle between them had already begun.

“Cough, the reason why I have invited everyone here is primarily to form an alliance.” Yan Xianlu finally announced the main topic.

“Hahahaha!” Shan Jitong immediately erupted into raucous laughter. “Alliance? What a joke, you want me to become allies with this trash?” His eyes swept over those assembled, filled with utter disdain towards them. Of course, when his eyes passed over Hu Niu, his pupils dilated a little.

It was as if Hu Niu’s fierceness was still in front of his eyes!

Yan Xianlu’s gaze became stern, and he said, “Brother Shan, if you have a disagreement about this, you may leave immediately. There is no need for you to be derisive and snide. However, I can tell you that you will definitely regret that action!”

Shan Jitong faltered, showing an expression of hesitation. Should he immediately leave without a backward glance, or stay and listen?

If he stayed, that would be a little embarrassing for him, but Yan Xianlu actually declared something like he would regret it if he left. Then, he had to be very certain of that. Monarch tiers like them would definitely not blurt nonsense in this kind of situation.

After hesitating for a long time, Shan Jitong still chose to sit back down on the rock he was initially perched on. He had made his decision: he was definitely not going to speak again later on. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if Shan Jitong had embarrassed himself, how could the others dare to laugh at him? They all remained expressionless, acting as if they had not seen anything. Only Lao Song smirked coldly, expressing his contempt for Shan Jitong.

“How fun!” Hu Niu meanwhile clapped, her voice crisp and cheery.

Shan Jitong only acted as if he had not heard her. He closed his eyes. What the eye didn’t see, the heart didn’t grieve over.

Everyone clicked their tongues in amazement. It was as if Yan Xianlu and Shan Jitong had both repressed themselves in the treatment of this young girl, which made the others even more curious. Who exactly was this young girl?

This time, Yan Xianlu was a little thankful to Hu Niu. Even he could not possibly completely suppress Shan Jitong, but Hu Niu could.

True enough, a fierce person needed another fierce person to deal with him.

“The Celestial Realm is colossal. Merely the boundless seas have separated the Eastern Celestial Realm and Western Celestial Realm, and our Eastern Celestial Realm is further divided into 33 Heavens.” Yan Xianlu began to explain some geographical information.

Because of this, some showed expressions of impatience. Had they come to listen to this? But there were also many others whose expressions did not change. How could it be possible that those who could become top-notch emperor tiers did not even have this little bit of patience?

Moreover, would Yan Xianlu talk about this for no reason?

“Our Calm Peace Heaven, to be honest, can only be ranked at the bottom of the 33 Heavens, having the same rank as Wide Prosperity Heaven and Far West Heaven,” Yan Xianlu stated calmly. “When the overall level of strength of the Western Celestial Realm is also superior to the Eastern Celestial Realm’s, our Calm Peace Heaven can only be ranked last in the entire Celestial Realm.

“Some time ago, I decided to travel around in the Western Celestial Realm, but in the end, I did not embark on the journey. Instead, I went to the Wide Prosperity Heaven, and decided to train there first.

“In the end, I encountered an opponent... that I was no match for!”

All of a sudden, the masses erupted in uproar.

Who was Yan Xianlu? A Divine Fetus that was born on the Celestial Path, a being that very possibly could’ve been birthed from heaven and nurtured by earth. He should’ve been an ultimate monarch tier that was invincible among his peers, so how could he have possibly been defeated?

“Brother Yan, it must be that that opponent’s cultivation level is too high, right?” Someone immediately piped up with a smile, hoping against hope.

Yan Xianlu shook his head, and replied, “That’s not the case. That person was the same as me, a fifth severance as well.”

When these words left his mouth, everyone was silenced.

Shan Jitong opened his mouth to speak, but ultimately could not say anything.

He was very defiant, yet had a good measure of himself. His battle prowess should be inferior compared to Yan Xianlu’s, so if even Yan Xianlu was no match, what was he worth then?

Lao Song was much calmer. Only his “flirtatious eyes” became even narrower, making him look more like a poisonous serpent.

“That person’s name is Shi Xiuwen,” Yan Xianlu continued. “According to him, in the Wide Prosperity Heaven, he... can only be ranked ninth in terms of strength!”

Pu, a considerable number spluttered.

‘Impossible! Definitely impossible!’

With how strong Yan Xianlu was, he had actually been defeated by someone who was merely ranked ninth in the Wide Prosperity Heaven. How could this be believed?
