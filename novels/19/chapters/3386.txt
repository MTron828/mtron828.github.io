Chapter 3387: Ling Han’s Counterattack

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Jin Shaojian was very arrogant, he was definitely knowledgeable.

How could he not recognize Qi Liandong and Chen Hao?

What were these two doing here?

Jin Shaojian actually didn’t take Qi Liandong and Chen Hao to heart, but he had to admit that these two could definitely be considered mighty figures in the

Dark North Nation.

Therefore, it was very strange for two mighty figures to enter the Heaven

Prison hand in hand.

This was not a place for eating and gatherings.

Could it be?

A guess crossed his mind, but he immediately shook his head. How could this be possible?

“Humph, who said just now that no one can see Ling Han without Yang Bai’s permission?” Qi Liandong also saw Jin Shaojian, and immediately pointed at him as he asked Xi Boyi, “Then who is this person?”

Xi Boyi was also a little confused. He didn’t know this person.

However, the problem was that if he did not have any background, how could he appear here? And looked relaxed as if this was his backyard?

He really had a headache. Who exactly was this Ling Han? Why had he alerted so many people?

“Who are you?” Xi Boyi shouted at Jin Shaojian.

“You don’t have to care who I am. You’re not qualified to know,” Jin Shaojian

said calmly.

Xi Boyi was furious. This was his territory, and you were trying to steal the limelight?

However, before he could fly into a rage, Qi Liandong pressed him down and said, “Cut the crap and let him go immediately!”

Xi Boyi felt that he was a complete tragedy. Logically speaking, this was his territory and he should be the one in charge. However, none of them were taking him seriously. How could he endure this?

It couldn’t be helped. After all, these two were Lords.

He waved his hand and said to the guard, “Open the door and let him go.”

Jin Shaojian watched and did not say anything. He only looked surprised.

No wonder Ling Han was so confident. It turned out that he had the backing of two Chairpersons.

He sneered. They were only a four-star alchemist and Formation Master and this was nothing in the previous civilization. It was only now that the great dao had revived. Everything started from scratch, which was why four-star alchemists and Formation Masters were praised so highly.

“Consider yourself lucky this time,” Jin Shaojian said to Ling Han, and swaggered off.

If it wasn’t for Qi Liandong and Jin Shaojian, Xi Boyi would definitely have rushed forward to stop Jin Shaojian and ask him where he came from and who let him in. However, with the two Chairpersons around, he didn’t have the mood to care. He only hoped that the two of them would leave quickly.

Ling Han chuckled. The Jin Clan? He would remember this.

He walked out of the cell and nodded at Qi Liandong and Chen Hao. “Thank

you, Chairpersons.”

“You didn’t suffer much, right?” Qi Liandong hurriedly asked.

“Whoever dares to mistreat you, I’ll tear him apart!” Chen Hao said fiercely.

Xi Boyi’s heart skipped a beat. He was afraid that Ling Han would say something bad about him.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I ate well, and lived well. It’s quiet here, so I just treated it as a vacation and rested.”

“That’s good.” The two Chairpersons smiled at the same time.

“Let’s go.”

After the three of them left, Xi Boyi began to investigate who had let Jin Shaojian in. Was this place still under his control?

Ling Han first went to the Formation Masters Association, because it was closer.

He decided to certify as a grandmaster-level Formation Master.

“What? You’ve reached the grandmaster level?” Chen Hao was surprised.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I just want to give it a try.” He did not speak too confidently.

However, under the witness of dozens of Formation Masters, he successfully created the grandmaster-level formation foundations and successfully set them up and activated them.

Back when he created the 33 Layered Vajra Formation, he had already advanced to the grandmaster level.

Qi Liandong was very jealous. “Brat, how much time have you spent on formations? You’ve neglected your alchemy.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How is that possible? Lets go, lets go to the Alchemist Association. I’ll verify as a grandmaster level alchemist.”

‘You can do that?’

Everyone was speechless. You’re too freakish, aren’t you? Who would immediately go and certify as a grandmaster-level alchemist after just being certified as a grandmaster-level Formation Master?

A freakish person was indeed a freakish person.

Ling Han went to the Alchemist Association, and successfully concocted a cauldron of four-star medicinal pills. This meant that his alchemy skills had also reached their current peak, and he could stand shoulder to shoulder with

Qi Liandong.

With these two identities, would anyone in the Dark North Nation dare to touch him?

Grand Tutor Hong’s status was only on par with his-no, considering that Ling Han was also a Formation Master and an alchemist, even people like Grand Tutor Hong were slightly inferior to him.

Ling Han returned to the academy. The amount of time he could still stay here could be counted on one’s fingers.

-Father, that Grand Tutor Hong is too detestable!” Eldest Baby immediately shouted.

“We can’t just let it go like this!” Second Baby also said.

“F*ck him up!” Seventh Baby said, but she immediately yawned. “Let me sleep

for a while. Just wake me up when we fight.”

Pa, she fell to the ground and fell asleep just like that.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “We can’t swallow this loss for nothing! However, if we go head-to-head with Grand Tutor Hong, this matter isn’t appropriate. After all, this is the Dark North Nation, and we still have to stay here for some time.”

He thought for a moment. “The Hong Clan should have a lot of business.

Tonight, we’ll destroy all the Hong Clan’s assets.”

“Alright, alright!” The group of children immediately became excited. They were too passionate about destroying things.

Ling Han first communicated with Xuanyuan Dingguo and asked him to list out all of the Hong Clan’s businesses. This was definitely something that Xuanyuan Dingguo was more familiar with. With several large factions fighting openly and covertly, Xuanyuan Dingguo was definitely very familiar with the Hong Clan’s information.

As expected, Xuanyuan Dingguo sent the information over without hesitation.

After that, Xuanyuan Dingguo exclaimed, “Weren’t you locked up in the prison?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“En, I just came out,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“How did you get out?” Xuanyuan Dingguo was surprised. “You didn’t escape from prison, did you?”

“Escape your head,” Ling Han scolded, and then said, “I’ll find you for a drink in a couple of days.” With that, he turned off the optical computer.

He turned around and looked at the children. “We’ll move out tonight. Everyone else, enter the gourd and let Sixth Baby take them. We have to let the Hong Clan know that we did it, but they can’t get any evidence. We have to make them depressed.”

The children were all excited. They loved to cause trouble.

“Kill them!” Seventh Baby muttered. It turned out that she was talking in her sleep.

Sigh, did he lead this group of brats astray?

Ling Han could not help but reflect on himself for a moment.

At night, Sixth Baby took advantage of the dark of night and brought the Essence Nurturing Gourd to the Hong CLan’s first property. After finding a secluded corner to release them, everyone immediately began to cause great destruction.

After dealing with one place, they went to another place. In just one night, they had destroyed thirteen properties of the Hong Clan.

No one died. They were all knocked unconscious and did not see anything.

The next morning, Grand Tutor Hong received the news.

BANG!

He struck out with his palm, and the desk below was instantly shattered into pieces.

“Ling Han!” he cursed through gritted teeth..
