Chapter 2255: Low Morale

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, if they didn‚Äôt deploy a Monarch Star, how could they suppress Hu Niu?

A humanoid being stepped forward. Even though his skin was crimson-red, it was decorated with thin golden trails that radiated with an air of might and dominance.

‚ÄúXin Tu,‚Äù he said as he pointed at himself. He glared at Hu Niu, and he didn‚Äôt conceal his surging killing intent at all.

‚ÄúGirl, come back,‚Äù a mighty figure from the Celestial Realm said to Hu Niu.

Xin Tu was a Monarch Star, so she couldn‚Äôt face him head-on. Otherwise, her fate would be certain death. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Hu Niu had initially been unwilling, but upon hearing Ling Han secretly telling her to retreat, she pouted her lips and retreated to the side.

Afterward, this would be a stage for Monarch Stars, one in which even monarch tiers didn‚Äôt have the right to enter. Of course, this was unless they possessed a significant advantage in terms of cultivation level.

The Rain Emperor was the first to step forward.

The two Monarch Stars immediately unleashed their full strength to clash with each other. One of them was at the Sixth Secret, while the other was at the sixth layer of the Eighth Lotus. Their cultivation level was identical, yet the Rain Emperor was the one with the superior battle prowess.

The Rain Emperor was a genuine cultivation prodigy, and his battle talent and ability were inconceivably freakish. Add to that the Celestial Dao Physique that he had obtained, and his battle prowess was naturally even higher. It wasn‚Äôt long before he gained the upper hand, and completely suppressed Xin Tu.

This elicited thunderous cheers from the Celestial Realm. Meanwhile, the cultivators from the Foreign Realm fell quiet.

Were they going to lose two battles in a row?

More importantly, both of these losses were against opponents at the same cultivation level. This was a huge blow to their morale.

The Foreign Realm was higher in level than the Celestial Realm, so in a battle against someone at the same cultivation level, they should have possessed an advantage.

Xin Tu unleashed all of his abilities, yet facing the fist technique of the Rain Emperor, he had absolutely no chance to turn the tables. He was continually pummeled, and one of his arms was evenly violently torn off. However, his counterattacks could barely leave any marks on the Rain Emperor.

This was because the Rain Emperor could transform into the flow of time. It was as if he existed in the past, yet it was also as if he existed in the future. As such, how could he be wounded?

If the other party wanted to wound the Rain Emperor‚Äôs celestial physique, he needed to possess a noticeable advantage in cultivation level.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough,‚Äù an elite from the Foreign Realm said.

However, the Rain Emperor completely ignored him. As long as his opponent still stood on the platform, he wouldn‚Äôt relent a single bit.

‚ÄúI told you to stop!!‚Äù the elite from the Foreign Realm said in rage, reaching over to grab at the Rain Emperor.

‚ÄúHeh, this is a battle between youths, so why are you trying to interfere?‚Äù a mighty figure from the Celestial Realm said as they reached over to block the elite from the Foreign Realm.

Peng!

The elite from the Foreign Realm was instantly sent flying.

Just then, a Celestial King from the Celestial Realm had called for an end to the first battle, yet an elite from the Foreign Realm had stepped forward to interfere. Now, the exact opposite was happening. At this moment, it was as if the cultivators from the Celestial Realm had ingested a top-notch Celestial pill. They felt as euphoric as could be.

The attacks of the Rain Emperor didn‚Äôt stop, and half of Xin Tu‚Äôs body was utterly mangled and destroyed. However, a Monarch Star was a Monarch Star, after all, and he ultimately managed to escape.

They had won another battle!

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm were beside themselves with delight. It had already been too long since they had witnessed such a satisfying victory.

The Foreign Realm remained silent for a moment before sending forth a new competitor.

Sen Luo. Not only was he a Monarch Star, but he was more so a supreme freak at the 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus. This was equivalent to a Tenth Secret elite.

The Rain Emperor attacked, yet the gulf between the Sixth Secret and the Tenth Secret was far too great. He was sent flying with a single strike, and if it weren‚Äôt for Ling Han‚Äôs secret help, he would have definitely been killed in an instant.

Proud expressions returned to the faces of the cultivators from the Foreign Realm. Perhaps the Rain Emperor was powerful, but they had even more powerful prodigies. Everything would be fine as long as they ultimately achieved victory. It was as if the Celestial Realm would definitely be defeated by the Foreign Realm.

Sen Luo possessed a towering physique. He was a humanoid, and his skin was so red that it was almost black. There was a golden horn on his head, and he also had a tail that was astonishingly long, so much so that it was like a hand. His tail continued to coil and swish around.

He wore an expression of pride and arrogance as he looked toward the Celestial Realm, saying, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs coming up to die?‚Äù

Whoosh!

A figure materialized. It was none other than Shi Chanzi.

‚ÄúThis humble monk will battle against you,‚Äù Shi Chanzi said in a seemingly amiable voice. However, when he attacked, it was as if he were a demonic deity. He possessed the demeanor of the Buddhist Sect‚Äôs Nine Lights Ancient Buddha. Moreover, he was indeed powerful, and his Golden Body Mystical Power had already been cultivated to a pinnacle level. His body transformed into a golden god of battle, and when he tapped his finger for the ages, he could seemingly exterminate celestials and slay gods.

Ling Han was astonished by what he saw. Shi Chanzi had actually reached the Ninth Secret!

This was incredibly astonishing. Only 1000 years or so had passed, yet he had actually soared from the First Secret to the Ninth Secret. This progress was far too rapid.

However, this was still completely useless.

Sen Luo‚Äôs cultivation level was equivalent to the Tenth Secret, which was an entire minor level above Shi Chanzi.

Moreover, who were they?

They were Monarch Stars!

They had reached the pinnacle level, a state of perfection, in each cultivation level. It was only because of this that they could enjoy the title of Monarch Star. That being the case, a gap of one minor level was naturally an insurmountable gulf.

Shi Chanzi unleashed all of his abilities, yet he could only wind up with a resounding defeat. He more so suffered a severe wound, with a bloody hole punched open in his lower abdomen.

Hong Huang and Jia Lan stepped forward one after another, yet neither of them could escape the fate of defeat. There was nothing they could have done about this, either. After all, they were only at the Ninth Secret.

The morale of the Celestial Realm fell to rock bottom. Only Xing Chenyue had yet to battle, with the other prodigies completely unable to rival Sen Luo.

Sure enough, the next person to step forward was Xing Chenyue. This was the Celestial Realm‚Äôs final hope.

Xing Chenyue was tall and slender, and she had raven-black hair that stretched down to her knees. She was wearing a white dress, and even though it had no decorations, she was still a beautiful sight to behold.

She stood with her hands clasped behind her back, and her long hair gently flowed with the soft breeze. She was like an ethereal celestial maiden.

However, Sen Luo didn‚Äôt appreciate her beauty at all. They were from two starkly different realms, so he was naturally unable to appreciate Xing Chenyue‚Äôs charm. On the contrary, a look of cruel bloodlust appeared in his eyes, and he said, ‚ÄúFemale being, you‚Äôre quite extraordinary. There‚Äôs a hint of Source Power in your blood, and if I can refine you, this will bring me great benefits.‚Äù

In the eyes of the beings from the Foreign Realm, the cultivators from the Celestial Realm weren‚Äôt people at all. They were no different from livestock.

Xing Chenyue simply flicked her sleeve, and she appeared as elegant as could be.

‚ÄúHaha, you‚Äôre mine!‚Äù Sen Luo roared as he unleashed an attack at Xing Chenyue.

As they exchanged attacks, the cultivators from the Celestial Realm finally breathed a sigh of relief. This was because Xing Chenyue wasn‚Äôt suppressed at all. However, in the next instant, they immediately furrowed their brows.

In a battle between cultivators from the two realms, as long as the cultivator from the Celestial Realm didn‚Äôt gain the upper hand, they would definitely end up losing.

Why?

Because of Regulations! This was the neutral zone, where they couldn‚Äôt replenish their power of Regulations. Thus, whoever could lock more Regulations in their body would ultimately end up being the victor.

Sure enough, after battling for around 10 hours, Xing Chenyue started to show signs of fatigue.

This was inevitable. Regulations were the weapons of cultivators, and without them, they would be like toothless beasts.

After exchanging several more strikes, Xing Chenyue was forced to admit defeat.

If she hadn‚Äôt admitted defeat, she would have genuinely been captured and devoured by Sen Luo.

What now?

Even Xing Chenyue had been defeated, and the Celestial Realm had suffered another resounding defeat. Thankfully, they had at least won two duels, and therefore won 20,000 years of peace for the Celestial Realm.

‚ÄúHahahaha!‚Äù The cultivators from the Foreign Realm all roared with laughter. They were brimming with prodigies, and just Sen Luo alone had been able to suppress the entire younger generation of the Celestial Realm. They still had Nai You and Wu Xin who hadn‚Äôt participated yet. As for the strongest Chi Xue, he more so didn‚Äôt need to participate.

Meanwhile, the Celestial Realm was feeling stifled under a dreary atmosphere. No one was in the mood to speak.

Was the gulf between the two sides truly so great?

At this moment, a person suddenly walked out from among the Celestial Realm cultivators.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Ji Wuming!‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh? What use is trying to be brave and stepping forward? Even Xing Chenyue was defeated.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed. Even though Ji Wuming is also a Monarch Star, he‚Äôs only at the same level as Shi Chanzi and Hong Huang. He‚Äôs nowhere near the level of Xing Chenyue. Even if he battles, he‚Äôll only collect another defeat for us.‚Äù

The cultivators from the Celestial Realm all shook their heads. What did it matter that Ji Wuming was a Monarch Star? He could only collect another defeat for them.

Ji Wuming glanced at Sen Luo.

Boom!

A formidable aura surged into the surroundings.

‚ÄúTenth Secret!‚Äù everyone exclaimed in astonishment.
