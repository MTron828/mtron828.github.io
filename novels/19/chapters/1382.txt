Chapter 1383 Readily surrendering

“The highest power of Regulations that can be released from this battle drum is Eternal River Tier.” Ling Han held onto the battle drum. It was too ancient. It seemed like it would be shattered into pieces the moment it was thrown onto the ground, “However, in the hands of a Heavenly Body Tier, it should not be capable of reaching this kind of height. Otherwise, my heart should have burst previously, and not merely been wounded.

“This should be a precious treasure of the Anyuan Branch. In front of the people of the Treasure Forest Pavilion, it would be best if I do not expose its existence. That would be practically writing the words “I was the one who killed Lin Zihong” on my forehead.

“Strictly speaking, I was indeed not the one who killed Lin Zihong. He had exploded himself.

“Hoho, however, as long as I am not on Cloud Apex Planet, this battle drum can be used at will, especially after I go to the Myriad Directions Galaxy. I would have advanced into the Eternal River Tier by then, and it would be particularly effective.

“What is most important is still the Divine Demon Sword. As expected of a Divine Sword, as long as it cuts into the physical body, or hits a vital point, it would mean ultimate death. If a vital point is not hit, then immediately severing the wounded limb could still ensure one’s survival. Otherwise, the murderous aura will spread out, and it’ll still lead to death.

“This is a higher level of Regulations. Even if the Divine Demon Sword has not progressed to becoming a true Celestial Tool yet, it will still surpass ordinary God Tools,” Ling Han mused as he continued to retrieve the spoils of battle.

He gave himself six days’ time to freely roam around. On the seventh day, he definitely had to head to the core of this floor. What if it was also the same as the “Great Sun Palace”? He would be able to activate resonance and absorb the power contained within. Then, wouldn’t he be able to take another step forward?

He swept through the area filled with joy and expectation. This was a world of Godly medicine, with boundless value, causing Ling Han to be extremely excited.

However, this floor was ultimately different from the first floor. The Demonic Beasts here were not beings that Ling Han could simply draw into the Black Tower. They had their own consciousness, and had to be defeated first. If they could be defeated, then what need was there to draw them into the Black Tower?

The Demonic Beasts here lived alongside the Godly medicine. They did not feed on the Godly medicine, but rather absorbed the medicinal effects that seeped out from the Godly medicine, and grew strong alongside the Godly medicine from there.

The majority of Demonic Beasts were in the level of the Sun Moon Tier. Ling Han could easily suppress them with a single hand, but there were also Heavenly Body Tier ones. That would be slightly more troublesome. However, if he encountered Demonic Beasts at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, even Ling Han would have to find a way around them. He would first lead the Demonic Beast away, and then return to harvest the Godly medicine.

When there was no one around him, Ling Han tried out the battle drum. Its destructive power on those in the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier was limited. It could cause an injury, but it would make the Demonic Beast even more berserk.

More frighteningly, there was an old turtle that was in the Eternal River Tier. It was as massive as a mountain, and there was also a Level 13 Godly medicine growing upon its back. That was a tea plant, called Zen Tea.

The plant’s leaves could be drunk as tea—of course, they had to be first refined by an alchemist, who would extract the concept and Regulations of heaven and earth from within—which could help in comprehending Dao with a taste. It would be effective for all cultivators in the Eternal River Tier and below.

Ling Han scrambled his brains, but faced with a being in the Eternal River Tier, he was not even able to handle a sliver of the aura exuded by the creature.

And this was still because that old turtle was sleeping. Otherwise, if it actively began to attack, there would definitely be no living creature that could survive on this whole second floor.

Ling Han spent two days’ time here. He had even thrown the Notionless Saint out, but it was still useless—this ex-Saint was indeed quite effective as a scare tactic, but the old turtle slept all this while. He didn’t even manage to wake it up, so how was he supposed to scare it?

Furthermore, if there was no hourglass above his head, he would immediately begin to weaken the moment he came out. He would be expelled by the Medicine King’s Cave. Ling Han hurriedly retrieved the Notionless Saint, and it was inevitable that he would be cursed by this ex-Saint.

“Forget it. Discretion is the better part of valor, and a good man would not bother about this little bit of gain and loss,” he comforted himself, but his whole face was completely twisted. He was 100% saying these words without actually meaning them.

He sighed. After Ling Han went to a few places with value, he had still attained considerable gains. Finally, he arrived at the end of this floor.

Xichen Palace Hall[1].

Ling Han looked at the three words above the palace hall, and similarly discovered that some kind of power was sealed within. However, the depressing thing was that he was unable to form any kind of resonance with it and absorb this power from there.

He was extremely depressed. This represented a sub-minor level, and could save him at least a few hundred years’ of hard cultivation.

He was unwilling to give up, and endlessly tried. In any case, he still had a lot of time, so he was not in a rush.

One day and night passed, and he had still made no progress, so he could only give up.

“Handsome!” A sugary sweet voice rang out, and he saw Lin Yuqi gracefully walk towards him from the distance. As she walked, she was still waving her arm. Her sleeve slipped down, revealing a section of her fair and smooth arm, causing one’s heartbeat to quicken.

Thankfully, there were less than 100 Heavenly Body Tiers here. Who would dare to stare at this kind of elite and reveal a lecherous gaze?

Ling Han nodded. Suddenly, a thought flashed in his heart, and when she had come close enough, he asked, “Do you want to have a bit of good luck?”

Yet Lin Yuqi showed an expression of suspicion, and she asked, “You aren’t thinking of deceiving me into getting in bed with you, are you? Hehe, if you like me, you can say it directly. It’s not impossible that I can consider marrying you and dote on you every day.”

Ling Han paid her words no attention. As long as he did not reply, she would definitely give up on her own after talking on and on without any response from him. He pointed at the three words above the doors of the palace hall, and said, “There is a martial intent left behind by an elite hidden within there. As long as you can form resonance with it, you would be able to increase your cultivation level.”

“Really?” Lin Yuqi’s expression was filled with doubt. If you were really so awesome, why didn’t you take it for your own? “Handsome, just to deceive me into being touched, this trick of yours is really too inferior!

“But for the sake of your sincerity, I am still slightly touched.”

Ling Han put on a poker face, and replied, “It’s up to you whether you believe it or not!”

After he said these words, he walked forth and entered into the palace hall. Furthermore, he realized that after he entered this place, the hourglass above his head also stopped flowing. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Which also meant that he could prepare well here before he went to undergo the test.

***

Lin Yuqi watched as Ling Han entered into the palace hall, her pretty face bearing an expression of confusion.

Ordinarily, Ling Han should not be resorting to such low-level means to deceive her... so she had best take a good look.

She raised her head and looked upwards. Under her full concentration, it seemed as if she had attained some kind of resonance with these three words. The Origin Power in her body surged up violently as if it was about to surge out of her body.

That really was the case!

She hurriedly used her heart to guide it, and shortly after, a divine light exuded from her slender body, her cultivation level rapidly soaring.

If Ling Han had seen this, he would definitely loudly exclaim at the injustice.

That was because he had completely no means to activate the three words above, and when he had been on the first floor, he had also used three days’ time to finally activate the resonance of the three words of “Grand Sun Palace”. He hadn’t been as fast as she had been.

“The peak stage of the low extreme!” After 30 minutes, Lin Yuqi exclaimed with pleasant surprise. “Handsome little brother, you are so nice to me, so how can I spare you! Just obediently surrender to fate; I am definitely going to devour you!”

She also entered into the palace hall. After rooting out the first floor for so long, she did not waste the slightest bit of time after she had arrived on the second floor. Her motive was to accumulate enough time to stay here and proceed to the fifth floor to gather a Godly medicine.

This was the main purpose for entering here in the first place.
