Chapter 538: Kidnap

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Helian Xun Xue finally released him, but hid herself behind Ling Han, tightly gripping onto the corner of his shirt. Ling Han could distinctly feel her trembling.

Such an overbearing, domineering woman actually had such a delicate side to her?

Could amnesia cause someone’s character to experience a tremendous change? Or would it cause someone to show a side that they usually kept hidden deep within?

Ling Han did not know, nor did he care. The biggest problem for him now was: how was he supposed to throw this huge burden away? This was practically a time bomb. When she actually managed to regain her memories, this time bomb would explode. Just the mere thought of it would give him insomnia.

” Hai Niu 1 , let’s see how fast you can run,” Ling Han said. He had already led Helian Xun Xue far away from the mine to avoid her going into another emotional turbulence and strangling him into a corpse.

“Oh!” Helian Xun Xue nodded, then asked curiously, “Why do you call me Hai Niu?”

“Because I want to!” Ling Han glared at her.

Instantly, Helian Xun Xue’s eyes brimmed with tears. Thne, she said with an aggrieved pout, “Why are you being so harsh toward me?”

Immediately, Ling Han bared his teeth. If you want to cry, just go ahead, but why do you have to grip a hand around his neck? Did she not know that this move could cause a fatality? However, he did not dare to carelessly toss away such a time bomb, either. Otherwise, if she really did explode, even if she only possessed the physical strength of the Spiritual Infant Tier, it was still a very terrifying thing.

Furthermore, this was only his estimate. What if her physical technique had reached the level of the Heaven Tier?

“I won’t be harsh toward you anymore, all right?” Ling Han sighed.

Against a Helian Xun Xue at her prime, he would not admit defeat in the slightest, and even tricked her successfully. If it was not for the fact that she had a very powerful Spirit Tool in her possession, she would have been killed by his trap already.

But the current her was unable to circulate Origin Power, and her intelligence had also become adorably low. But now, on the contrary, she actually managed to suppress Ling Han. This fact was something that Ling Han found inconceivable no matter how much he pondered on the matter.

Why had things become this way?

Helian Xun Xue let go, her expression clearly saying, ‘If you dare to be harsh toward me, I’ll continue to strangle you’, acting perfectly like a little wife.

Ling Han broke out in a cold sweat. He had already had quite a few times of physical contact with her. After this woman regained her memory, she would definitely fly into a humiliated rage! Moreover, he had even just about estimated the measurements of her flat chest, which was really inadequate.

“Then, let’s go!” His legs exerted force, and xiu , his entire person immediately shot up into the skies.

Helian Xun Xue quickly took a leap just like Ling Han. However, she was faster, and also managed to reach a greater height. Immediately, she had surpassed Ling Han. At first, she was greatly astonished that she could actually manage to jump so high, but then, she instantly became excited, releasing a bout of clear, tinkling laughter.

Ling Han sighed. It would be nice if she could stay the way she was now forever and leave all the fighting and killing for men to do.

A thought flashed through his head. Could he use this period of time to instill some concepts of peace and beauty into Helian Xun Xue? Though she had lost her memory, her current experiences would become part of her memories in future as well, and would definitely have some influence on her.

To personally train her?

‘It’s a very dastardly plan, but I like it!’

Though neither of them used any kind of technique, the pure force of their physical bodies was already terrifying enough. Moreover, the advantage of brute force was that it could last a long time, just like the brute force of demonic beasts and unlike that of cultivators, who were limited by the size of the Spiritual Oceans in their Dantian. The moment their Origin Power was completely expended, they would become absolutely useless.

As a result, the two of them raced for over an hour in a single breath, and soon arrived at the small town Ling Han was staying in. However, neither of them was short of breath.

Ling Han was actually a little worried. There was a risk to bringing this girl home; hopefully, it wouldn’t lead to a scene of slaughter and bloodshed. But for the sake of instilling some concepts of peace, happiness, and the like, he had to let this girl experience what it felt like to be cared for and loved.

They entered into the Ling Residence. When the servants saw Ling Han, they all bowed and paid their respects, but unlike the restrained manner of other servants, they had a friendly and cordial air. Soon after, Ling Dong Xing and Yue Hong Chang ran out as well. Their son had been gone for a few days, but to them, it was as if several years had passed since they last saw him.

“This is...” Yue Hong Chang was surprised. Her son was really amazing; just a few days, and he had kidnapped yet another beautiful daughter-in-law. What else could she be? The girl looked very bashful, and kept holding onto the corner of her son’s shirt, showing just how much she stuck close to him.

Tsk, she was really beautiful. Furthermore, she had a pair of unusual blue eyes and a good figure as well, especially her legs—they were slender and long, and her backside was highly raised, displaying an amazing flexibility.

Though... her breasts were a little small! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

That’s all right; even if she gave birth, it was not a must that the baby had to feed from her.

Yue Hong Chang had already visualized what would happen many, many years in the future, and a bright smile immediately appeared on her face. She walked over and asked, “Miss, what is your name?” She did not pay any attention to her son at all.

“I am Helian Xun Xue,” the princess of the Sea Race answered.

“Miss, come with me!” Yue Hong Chang held Helian Xun Xue’s hand and left—naturally to teach her some secret techniques as her mother-in-law, such as how to handle her son.

Ling Dong Xing patted Ling Han’s shoulder in quiet sympathy, and both father and son were simultaneously rendered speechless.

Ling Han let Hu Niu out. When the little girl saw Helian Xun Xue, her ferocious nature was on full display. This woman gave her a very strong oppressive feeling, making her have the urge to rip open the former’s neck.

“Come, let’s eat,” Ling Han said, smiling.

Hu Niu’s expression instantly switched to a smile, and she happily followed him in.

It was not possible that the matter of the Sea Race would simply end like this. After all, a princess had “died”, so it would definitely give rise to a great commotion. However, even those far off in the Imperial City could feel the activity at the battle of the mine, so if the Sea Race really headed there to investigate the place, they would definitely not come out of it easily.

With that giant silver spider in place, he believed that there was no need to worry about the Desolate North.

What worried Ling Han, on the other hand, was that old mine.

What exactly was buried underneath it?

Just twelve ancient corpses and a mountain-size spider? He did not believe that was all.

But with the giant silver spider there, could he go to the deeper levels to find out?

If he wanted to know what exactly was buried underneath the old mine, he needed greater power. At the very least, he had to regain his cultivation level at the Heaven Tier—backed by the Black Tower, he should be able to explore further. The safest way was naturally for him to break through to the Shattering Void Tier; that way, he’d be able to barge in directly.

He planned to stay at home for a dozen over days before heading towards the middle state.

Both Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan decided to stay back in the Ling Residence and wait for Ling Han to return. Firstly, they already had sufficient resources for cultivation, and secondly, they were there to protect the Ling Clan. Li Si Chan still had to help concoct alchemical pills for Ling Dong Xing and his wife.

...With Ling Han’s training, Li Si Chan had improved extremely fast in alchemy. By now, she was only restricted by her own cultivation level. Otherwise, she would have already made the leap to become a Black Grade high level alchemist.

The strategy they were using was to obtain victory in a rounabout way; as long as they had convinced their parents-in-law, did they still have to worry that Ling Han was unwilling to recognize them as his wives?

Ling Han also left Guang Yuan and Zhu Wu Jiu behind to guard the Ling Clan. Their talent was limited, and if they wanted to break through to the Flower Blossom Tier, they still needed to accumulate enough power for at least a dozen over years. They wouldn’t be able to help much even if they followed Ling Han, so it would be better for them to stay behind and work hard on their cultivation.

Thus, after a dozen over days, Ling Han, Hu Niu... as well as Helian Xun Xue set out, heading towards Extreme Yang City.

There was no way he could manage to shove off this sea girl. Even if Yue Hong Chang had successfully duped her into calling Yue Hong Chang “mother”, it was as if she was a newly born chick. Since the first person she had set eyes on was Ling Han, she was determined to follow him.
