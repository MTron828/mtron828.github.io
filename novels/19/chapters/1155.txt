Chapter 1156: Suppressed in all Aspects

Ling Han nodded in his mind. The inherent high quality of the Divine Demon Sword was finally displaying its might.

It was a God Tool that had the potential to become Divine Metal, after all, so how could it not be powerful?

Ling Han didn’t need to control his sword at all, as it was already fully engraved with his martial intent. He could manipulate it with just a thought, and doing so would be no different from wielding it with his hands.

This was a terrifying notion. This sword was equivalent to a separate body of Ling Han, so when it teamed up with him, just how overwhelming would his battle prowess become?

Wu Zhe instantly regretted summoning his God Tool.

Neither of them had summoned their God Tool just then, and he hadn’t been at a disadvantage, either. It was just that he didn’t have an opportunity to attain victory yet. However, it was because of his strong desire to achieve victory that he summoned his Three Clouds Three Flower Sword. He wanted to end the battle a soon as possible, and thus reaffirm his dignity as a senior brother.

However, who would’ve imagined that his opponent’s God Tool would be just as powerful as his? Moreover, it had an incredible affinity with Ling Han—it was as if it had been nurtured by him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This made him feel very miserable. This was really a case of going out for wool and coming back shorn—he had screwed himself over.

Ling Han’s heart and spirit were both linked to the Divine Demon Sword, and thus the Divine Demon Sword was able to channel his Sword Dao as it slashed toward Wu Zhe. Meanwhile, Ling Han also swung his fists at Wu Zhe.

This was the second path that he wanted to take.

The Sword Dao was his first choice. In any case, it would be a waste not to take the path of the Sword Dao since he already owned a God Tool like the Divine Demon Sword. However, he also wanted to take the path of the Unarmed Combat Dao.

He had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and his physique was so powerful that he could be viewed as a human weapon. He possessed the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art on top of that, and this technique allowed him to wield an endless power. Thus, he was extremely suited to close combat.

His fists, legs, elbows, and even head could all be used as deadly weapons!

Boundless divine light radiated from the Divine Demon Sword, and Ling Han’s fists were also raging with divine flames as they rained down on his opponent. Similar to the Rain Emperor, he was exuding an incredibly mighty and domineering aura.

He would crush whoever stood in his way!

Wu Zhe was unwilling to yield. He felt that Ling Han was far too overconfident. Generally speaking, people would only attack in such a manner if their power was far greater than that of their opponent.

If one swung their fists wildly as Ling Han did, they would suffer greatly if they came across an opponent who was slightly more powerful.

Wu Zhe roared in anger as he used his sword to parry the Divine Demon Sword. At the same time, his left hand also balled into a fist, and he punched at Ling Han.

As one of the six king tiers, he wasn’t afraid of anyone at the same cultivation level.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them continued to exchange blows. In terms of power, neither of them had an advantage over the other. Although Wu Zhe was slightly more powerful, it was only by a very insignificant margin. Thus, this could still be viewed as an evenly matched battle.

Their fists rained down on each other at incredible speed, and they had already exchanged 100 or so blows in just a few seconds. In the end, they separated from each other and concluded their brief moment of unarmed combat.

Ling Han was naturally unscathed. However, blood was dripping from Wu Zhe’s wounded left hand. In fact, his entire left arm was trembling in exertion.

Even Origin Power shields wouldn’t be of much use during such close-quarters combat—this was also why many cultivators avoided close-quarters combat whenever possible. Unarmed combat would reduce the effectiveness of Origin Power, though Origin Power was what most people cultivated. Very few people practiced Body Arts.

In terms of physique, it was clear that Ling Han had achieved a resounding victory!

Wu Zhe grimaced in disbelief.

His opponent’s divine sense was already frighteningly stable. Yet, right now, he realized that his opponent’s physique was also on a freakish level.

‘How can someone be so freakish?’

The spectators were all stunned.

Wu Zhe had unleashed his full battle prowess, yet he had still been wounded!

Who could’ve predicted this?

Meanwhile, Gan Shiyun’s slender body trembled in shock. She finally realized just how wrong she had been. She had provoked and offended an absolute freak!

If Ling Han didn’t die, his achievements would definitely surpass the ancients and amaze the contemporaries!

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Junior Brother Wu, are you still not going to admit defeat?”

Wu Zhe’s expression was livid, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Wasn’t this utterly humiliating?

He was one of the six kings, so who didn’t give him some face? However, this person who had just entered the sect was acting aggressive and overbearing. Was this really a smart choice?

“Han Lin, you’ve gone too far!” Wu Zhe said through gritted teeth.

Although he still had some trump cards, his mind went numb whenever he thought about his opponent’s incredible physique. Could his trump cards really contain his opponent? In any case, this was only a sparring match, and some of his trump cards were consumables—they would be gone once he used them. Thus, he wasn’t willing to use them, either.

That being the case, he hoped that Ling Han would relent after a while and not take things too far.

“Call me senior brother, and I’ll naturally go easier on you,” Ling Han said calmly. Wu Zhe had used shady tactics against the Rain Emperor, so how could Ling Han let him off the hook easily?

There was a dark look in Wu Zhe’s eyes, and his fists were also clenched tightly. He would never admit defeat.

“You really think you can win?” He channeled a forbidden technique, and a strange pattern appeared on his forehead. It radiated with a dim and eerie glow.

“What’s that?!”

The spectators were all astonished and frightened.

They had merely glanced at the pattern, yet it felt as if their minds had been slashed by a sword. This made them feel extremely uncomfortable.

“That... That’s the Extreme Nightmare Technique!” someone shouted in astonishment. “Heavens! Senior Brother Wu actually mastered that ancient technique!”

Everyone hurriedly asked the person what this technique was. Only then did he reveal that this was one of the most profound cultivation techniques of the Majestic Heaven Sect. However, it was incredibly difficult to cultivate, and there was no record of anyone being able to successfully master it. To their surprise, however, Wu Zhe was actually using this technique.

Wu Zhe’s aura changed noticeably, and a dark air rose from his body. It was as if he had transformed into Night-gaunt, one that would bring boundless nightmares to its victims.

Ling Han was completely unfazed. Both his physique and his divine sense had broken through the limit of the Mountain River Tier, so what did he need to worry about? He stood in an undefeatable position, and the only unknown was the method by which he would achieve victory.

‘Let’s see what he’s got.’ He was extremely interested in this cultivation technique as it caused a hint of fear to grip at his heart.

“You’ll regret this!” Wu Zhe said coldly. He made a punching motion toward Ling Han, and countless streaks of dark light surged from his fist.

He had suffered once already, so he didn’t dare engage in unarmed combat with Ling Han again. Instead, he reverted to cultivators’ traditional tactics—he increased his distance from the opponent to battle using martial arts techniques.

Ling Han swung his fists in defense.

Pu, pu, pu!

The streaks of dark light struck his fist, and they surprisingly left several patches of blood marks.

‘So powerful!’

Ling Han was astonished. One had to realize that the toughness of his physique was already on par with Level Five Godly metal. In other words, it was equivalent to the full power defense of a cultivator at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Even so, Wu Zhe’s attack had still left several blood marks on his fists. This was proof of just how terrifying the streaks of dark light were.

Meanwhile, Wu Zhe almost fainted in shock.

In reality, his cultivation level was too low for him to channel the Extreme Nightmare Technique. He was indeed able to channel it now, yet this came at the price of him not being able to use Origin Power for an entire three months after this!

He had paid such a heavy price, so the streaks of dark light that he had unleashed were naturally terrifying to the extreme. However, they merely left a few blood marks on Ling Han’s fists? How could he accept this?!

He wanted to vomit a large mouthful of blood!

“It’s fairly powerful, but it’s still not enough!” Ling Han laughed loudly as he manipulated his Divine Demon Sword and launched a flurry of attacks that completely suppressed Wu Zhe.
