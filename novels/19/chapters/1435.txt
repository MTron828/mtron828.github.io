Chapter 1436 Resounding Defea

The people present were all king tiers of the current generation, and thus they were naturally very skilled when it came to analyzing the battles of others.

When Ling Han’s fist struck Liu Juntian’s face, all of them squinted, and it was as if time had suddenly slowed down, with everything playing out in slow motion.

Of course, this wasn’t because time had actually slowed down, but rather because their minds were whirring far too quickly, making it seem as if the entire world around them had slowed down.

When Ling Han’s fist collided with the suit of flaming armor, a ball of boundless flames immediately surged toward him, yearning to disintegrate his fist. However, how powerful was Ling Han’s physique? Moreover, he had even bathed in immortal flames before. As such, these flames were but a tickle on his hand.

Peng!

Without receiving an iota of damage, Ling Han’s fist heavily slammed into Liu Juntian’s face. Like rolling waves, countless ripples started to undulate across his face. He was then lifted off his feet and sent flying backward.

The scene instantly sped up as the flow of time returned to normal.

Pa!

Liu Juntian thumped into the ground.

Astonishment swept over the mountain peak.

It was still too early to conclude who would win, yet one thing had already become apparent. Liu Juntian had suffered a huge loss in this exchange!

Ling Han retracted his fist. Among those at the same cultivation level, his freakish physique meant that he could ignore any attacks from his opponents. The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was from the Celestial Realm, and it was more so one of the most advanced cultivation techniques. As such, wouldn’t it be embarrassing if he couldn’t even suppress a cultivation technique from the Immortal Realm?

Liu Juntian picked himself up, shock all over his face. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was unable to accept this. His flaming armor had failed to even wound Ling Han’s skin! All it had achieved was creating a bit of smoke on Ling Han’s fist. This was analogous to a mortal quickly sweeping their hand through a flame—completely harmless.

‘How is this possible?! My divine flames can burn even elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier!’

Liu Juntian took a deep breath. Although he had already unleashed one of his most powerful attacks, it was clear that he had still underestimated Ling Han.

His opponent... was definitely a rank two king tier!

“No wonder you’re acting so arrogant. So, it turns out that you’re also a rank two king tier!” he spat in a baleful voice.

His words sent a wave of commotion through the king tiers.

Rank two king tier!

A small galaxy that didn’t even have an Eternal River Tier elite had actually produced a rank two king tier! How could they accept this? However, if Ling Han wasn’t a rank two king tier, how could he have sent Liu Juntian flying?

“Haha, I’m just so-so,” Ling Han replied indifferently. His wife was even more impressive than him—she was a rank three king tier!

Liu Juntian’s expression became even darker. Weren’t rank two king tiers impressive enough? After all, most Saints were only rank two king tiers as well. In other words, if they were at the same cultivation level, they could battle toe-to-toe with most Saints!

However, from Ling Han’s reply, rank two king tiers were only so-so. What else did he want?!

“Fine, then let us see which of us is the king among kings!” Fighting spirit soared from Liu Juntian as numerous black divine patterns materialized on his body. They were densely packed, and in the end, they transformed into lengths of chains that were wrapped around his body. It was as if he had transformed into a great demon god.

Boom!

As if they were experiencing the birth of the universe, the sound of rumbling thunder traveled out from Liu Juntian’s body. These were the sounds of dao!

The sound of dao had actually been released from the body of a Heavenly Body Tier elite! Just how incredible was this?

Even though the spectators were all king tiers, they still couldn’t help but feel stunned by this sight. No wonder Liu Juntian had received praise from a Saint. Indeed, he had already far surpassed the level of ordinary king tiers. In fact, his overwhelming prowess even exerted an intangible pressure on the surrounding king tiers, making these absolute prodigies want to gaze up to him in awe.

This powerful pressure also provoked Ling Han, causing him to drop his arrogant demeanor and become serious. An intense fighting spirit burst from his eyes, his pupil reflecting the images of exploding heavenly bodies. It was as if his pupils were reflecting a scene of destruction and creation.

It was a pity that no one took notice of this. Otherwise, they would definitely become even more shocked. Destruction and creation... This was the highest level of dao!

“I’ll obliterate you with a single punch!” Liu Juntian roared. He charged forward, a profoundly domineering aura emanating from his body.

Supreme king tiers like them could battle without pause for several years or even several hundred years. However, it was also possible that they could determine a victor after just two or three exchanges. This all came down to whether or not they were willing to unleash their most powerful trump cards. If they were, then the battles would naturally be over in a flash.

Chains of Regulations that had been formed from divine patterns were wrapped all over Liu Juntian’s body, making him appear like a demon king. At the same time, however, there were also sounds of dao emanating from his body like a chant. These juxtaposing powers made for an extremely peculiar scene. However, no one doubted his supreme power at this moment.

Boom!

The chains around his body shot out, the sounds of dao also transforming into a golden figure that possessed three heads and six arms. All of these attacks surged toward Ling Han.

This was Liu Juntian’s most powerful ultimate technique.

Ling Han didn’t hold back, either; he was going to battle with his full strength.

In the blink of an eye, Liu Juntian’s attack had already arrived!

Weng!

Ling Han unleashed heaven’s might before dashing forward, his hands pushing upward as he also activated Tide of the Ages. Without exception, the chains of Regulations and golden figure both started to disintegrate at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

Peng, peng!

Ling Han crashed into these attacks. However, how could these deteriorated attacks that were teetering on the edge of implosion wound or stop him?

He crashed straight through them, instantly arriving before Liu Juntian.

The spectating king tiers were all transfixed with shock. Such a formidable attack had actually failed to affect Ling Han?!

As Ling Han’s opponent, Liu Juntian had more so already gone numb with shock. He hurriedly raised his arms, crossing them before his chest. Origin Power surged before him, forming his last line of defense. However, it was a shame that he was in his weakest state after unleashing his ultimate technique. Moreover, Ling Han had already unleashed heaven’s might, forcefully suppressing his power by two stars. As such, his defense at this moment was laughably brittle and weak.

Ling Han launched another punch, again at Liu Juntian’s face.

Peng!

As if it were made from water, Liu Juntian’s Origin Power shield instantly shattered into pieces. Ling Han’s fist smashed into his face, sending him flying. However, a dim glow suddenly appeared, and a sigh unexpectedly traveled out from Liu Juntian’s body. This sigh carried with it a paramount might, causing all of the king tiers atop the mountain peak to go weak at the knees.

This was a suppression on the level of life. It was as like an Eternal River Tier elite facing a Heavenly Body Tier elite, or a Genesis Tier Saint facing an Eternal River Tier elite.

Liu Juntian crashed into the ground with a loud thump. Surprisingly, however, only his face was red and swollen. He hadn’t been killed.

This was inconceivable, not in the least because Ling Han’s punch had genuinely been tremendously powerful. In fact, Ling Han had unleashed his full power when throwing that punch. Not to mention that Liu Juntian was only at the medium extreme, his body should have been obliterated even if he were at the peak stage of the pinnacle level.

After all, not everyone possessed a physique as freakish as Ling Han’s. Once their Origin Power shield was shattered, their unprotected body would be incredibly weak against attacks.

The king tiers were all astounded. This time, their surprise wasn’t born from Ling Han’s unfathomable strength. Instead, it was caused by that sigh from Liu Juntian’s body. That sigh had caused even their souls to tremble in apprehension.

“This is the might of a Genesis Tier Saint! I’m certain!” someone exclaimed.

It wasn’t difficult to reach such a conclusion. Many of the king tiers were from super-large galaxies, and some were even the disciples or grand-disciples of Saints. Thus, it was only natural that they could recognize the aura of a Saint.

“I understand! This was something prepared by the Dīpankara Saint!”

“Indeed, the Dīpankara Saint had held high hopes for Liu Juntian, so it’s not surprising that he left a wisp of his aura inside his body.”

“As expected of a Saint. He saved Liu Juntian’s life.”

“However, it can only save him once.”

The king tiers chattered among themselves, discussing what they had just witnessed.

Meanwhile, Ling Han could obviously charge over to deal the killing punch. Or he could summon his Divine Demon Sword to end Liu Juntian’s life. However, since the Dīpankara Saint had already “appeared”, him killing Liu Juntian would be equivalent to him opposing the Dīpankara Saint.

Right now, he still didn’t possess the right to oppose a Saint.

‘So be it, I’ll spare Liu Juntian’s life. I’ll pretend that I’m giving face to a Saint.’
