Chapter 2572: Drastic change

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Tang Yuan couldn’t help but ask, “Big Sister Ling, do you know who Li Long’s opponent is?”

Yang Xiaoling was ranked in the top three of all the spoiled young masters and misses. Information he was unable to investigate might not necessarily be something unknown to Yang Xiaoling. He was really too curious, and couldn’t help but ask her.

“Don’t worry. It’s just a minor character,” Yang Xiaoling murmured through her red lips.

“En?” Both Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang were surprised. The ninth opponent was a frightening opponent like Niu Er, and the 10th was actually just a minor character?

‘That can’t be, right?’

Yang Xiaoling smiled faintly, and said, “That brat has already proven his own strength. Furthermore, I have also deliberately asked for him to be taken care of. How could it be that they would not be willing to give me face for just a little favor like this?”

Realization dawned on Tang Yuan and Zhao Shuang. If Ling Han was just any ordinary character, the tournament authorities naturally would not go easy on him, but in the last nine battles, especially the ninth, Ling Han had already fully proven his strength, so there was really no need to send out any outstanding elite in the 10th match.

The tournament authorities only limited the number of Blood Martial Kings in order to ensure the prestige of this title. It was not that they were deadly determined to prevent anyone from gaining this title.

Tang Yuan relaxed completely, and Zhao Shuang naturally had no interest to gamble with Tang Yuan again.

The commentator was still excitedly introducing who Ling Han was. Even if Ling Han was very well-known here, in truth, there were not many people that had truly seen him before. Thus, there were still bouts of shrieking here and there.

Expressionless, Ling Han waited for his opponent to appear.

“This time, Li Long’s opponent is Ma— yi!?” The commentator had not finished his words when he saw a commotion suddenly taking place at the passage of the tournament grounds.?Peng, a figure flew out, and landed solidly on the ground with a bang.

Clearly, it was not that person that had leaped out on his own, because a solid blow had landed on his face. Half his face had already caved in.

He was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, but at present, the peculiar light around him was blurred and vague, representing that his flame of life was also flickering weakly.

The commentator was stunned. That was because this was Ling Han’s opponent, yet now he had actually almost been beaten to death. How was he supposed to fight Ling Han now?

Furthermore, who would actually dare to act so recklessly in the tournament grounds? Didn’t they know that this was the territory of the Azure Ghost Celestial King?

Peng, another human figure shot out. This was a great man that was about three meters tall, but he had the hooves of a bull, a bull’s tail, and the head of a bull, with a single horn growing from his head. Who else could it be but Niu Er?

Even Ling Han was stunned. He wanted to open his Spatial Celestial Tool and check if Niu Er’s corpse was still there.

Wait, wrong. He had just had a feast of fried beef with onions with the women yesterday.

“You were the one who killed my younger brother?” This large man set his eyes on Ling Han, his eyes incredibly vicious and harsh.

‘Oh, so this is Niu Er’s older brother. Could it be that his name is Niu?Da1?’

Ling Han nodded. “The taste was not too bad, just a little too tough.”

The large man exploded with fury.?Zhi, white steam spewed from his nostrils right onto the ground, and forcefully blasted two pits open in the ground.

This was extremely shocking. It should be known that the bricks of the tournament ground were incredibly hard, strong enough to sustain a Celestial King Tier battle. However, merely the breath from his nose was enough to create two holes in the ground. This was too terrifying.

“N-Niu Da!” The commentator finally managed to speak. Even his voice was trembling because there were too many legends in the tournament grounds about Niu Da.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself. This guy’s name really was Niu Da.

Boom!

Everyone on the spectators’ seats had gone mad. Practically 90% of them had stood up, cheering wildly, and the focus of their cheering was precisely Niu Da, as if he was an invincible warrior.

“Niu Da, the tournament has rules. You want to take revenge for your younger brother, and I can understand that. You can challenge him in the future, but you can’t break the rules, or the results will be even worse for you!” the commentator said. Though he was feeling ill at ease, this had gone too far beyond the rules, and he had to say this.

Niu Da’s eyes instantly glared at him as he declared menacingly, “Since you know that I wish to take revenge for my younger brother, shut up. Otherwise, not only will I kill you, I will also kill all your three concubines, two sons, and six daughters!”

The commentator’s whole body trembled, and an expression of terror appeared on his face.

Niu Da was even more frightening than Niu Er. Not only was it because the former’s cultivation level was higher, natural talent better, and strength even bigger, it was also because he was crueler and even more merciless in character.

Others would just kill the directly involved party and that was it, but Niu Da would also grab everyone else that had relations with the person involved, kill all of them in front of him, and only then would he finally kill the person involved.

This was what built Niu Da’s name renowned for viciousness. His name was really so frightening that it could stop crying children at night.

But if Niu Da was really allowed to do as he liked, he would not be able to escape, either!

The commentator was just about to continue stubbornly persuading, yet suddenly started. He had received a message via divine sense. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He immediately looked very respectful, and at the same time relaxed. Since this person had spoken, there was no need to fear even if the sky fell down on him. After a while, he said, “I have just received instructions from Lord Yin River. His lordship has said that due to the fact that Niu Da is grieving for his brother, he is especially allowed to battle.”

Instantly, the masses erupted in uproar.

Something like this could be done?

Though Niu Da had not revealed his cultivation level, those in the spectators’ seats were all extremely clear that Niu Da was a Fifth Heaven Celestial King, and a monarch star at that!

According to the rules of the tournament, only a gap of a single Heaven was allowed for sniping battles. Now, Niu Da was two Heavens superior to Ling Han, and he was a monarch star at that, his battle prowess directly spiking to the Seventh Heaven.

Wasn’t this blatantly bullying?

But the one who had spoken was the Yin River Celestial King. Then, unless the Azure Ghost Celestial King spoke, no one would be able to change this decision.

That was because… the Yin River Celestial King was the disciple of the Azure Ghost Celestial King, and his only disciple at that. Moreover, he was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King, and could be considered the number one among the spoiled young masters and young misses.

In the spectators’ seats, Tang Yuan, Zhao Shuang, and Yang Xiaoling were all stunned. They were also helpless.

Whether it was in terms of the power of their fathers, or their respective battle prowess, they were all far from comparable to the Yin River Celestial King. Aside from accepting this, there was nothing else they could do, either.

“Hahahaha!” Following a loud laugh, Lu Li appeared. It was still A’Yuan behind him, a sword at his waist, while his hand was placed on the hilt of the sowrd, as if he would draw his sword at any moment to commit murder.

“Lu Li!” Tang Yuan said through gritted teeth. He just happened to be in a bad mood. No matter how high an opinion he had of Ling Han, he knew that Ling Han would definitely be done for this time, and a dead man naturally would not be worth him expending further effort.

At this moment, the last person he wanted to see was Lu Li, much less with the latter throwing salt on his wounds.

“Scram! I don’t want to see you!” Tang Yuan exclaimed.

Yet Lu Li smirked. “Tang Yuan, I have purposely come to see you make a fool of yourself! Why do you think that it is so hard, just for the sake of contending for the mere title of Blood Martial King?”

“Could it be that it is you playing tricks?” Tang Yuan asked, stunned. He had indeed guessed this before, but did not think that Lu Li would have that kind of power.

“Who else could it be but me?” Lu Li erupted into laughter.

“Impossible, impossible, there is no way you could have done that!” Tang Yuan was feeling very panicked internally. If these words were true, then the power that Lu Li had would be too shocking.

Lu Li scoffed. “Tang Yuan, what basis do you have to contend with me? I’ll give you a chance. Come, kneel down and worship me, and I can take you as my lackey.”

Tang Yuan naturally could not embarrass himself like this. His old man was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King as well, for better or worse. He just couldn’t understand why Lu Li had suddenly gained such amazing power.
