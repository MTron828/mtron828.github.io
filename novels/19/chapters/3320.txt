Chapter 3321 - 3321: Mysterious energy

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ling Han, you are still the original you, and I am no longer the original me!” Hong Tianliang shouted loudly. His clawed hands brandished majestically, and a mysterious energy overflowed, possessing great destructive power.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself, and said, “Where do you get the confidence to think that I’m still the original me?”

“Humph, no matter what changes you have undergone, there is only one result that you will have in front of me, and that is defeat!” Hong Tianliang shouted lightly, and attacked continuously.

“Then let me see just how much progress you have made.” Ling Han casually shot out a punch. Under the release of his power, he did not directly clash with Hong Tianliang, but rather the force of both sides was clashing.

He shockingly discovered that the black energy wrapped around his opponent’s hand was really powerful. When his force hit it, it was like tofu meeting a sharp blade, easily sliced apart.

This kind of energy was of a higher level, just like the Sword Qi that had been delivered by the broken sword. It was clearly not very strong in terms of power, but its might was endless.

Could humans also make use of this kind of energy?

Tsk, this guy’s strength had really increased quite a bit. No wonder he was so confident. However, he wanted to use this to defeat him?

He was thinking too much.

Ling Han didn’t counterattack either. He simply dragged out the battle with Hong Tianliang. He was extremely interested in this kind of energy.

Outside.

“Big news, big news! Ling Han and Hong Tianliang have gotten into a fight!”

“Yi, the people ranked first and second in credits are finally on opposing sides?” “How exciting!”

“Who do you think will emerge victorious?”

“If it was in the past, I would guess that it would be Ling Han, but now, I’m betting on Hong Tianliang.”

“Why?”

“Just because he had been specially trained by that person for a few months.”

“… Although this is a little unreasonable, I actually can’t object.”

Everyone was discussing, but all of them were more optimistic about Hong Tianliang. That was because he was that person’s younger brother, and it was that simple.

“Also, why is there a layer of black around Hong Tianliang’s hands?”

“Did he practice some special claw technique?”

“I can’t see clearly. It seems to be very powerful. Just look, with a light swipe on the rock, the rock was split into two.”

“It’s as if there’s a peerless sword embedded in his hands. It’s greatly improving his battle prowess.”

“Now we can confirm that Ling Han is going to lose.”

“That’s right. He’s been dodging all this while, and doesn’t dare to face it head-on at all.”

Xiu, xiu, xiu! Hong Tianliang’s attacks became fiercer and fiercer. He had already gotten accustomed to battle, and displayed his full strength. Aside from the fact that he didn’t boil his blood and Qi and use a Spirit Tool, it could be said that he was going all out.

Ling Han still focused on roaming around and fighting, not fighting head-on with the other party.

“Do you think that it’s fine just as long as you don’t directly clash with me?” Hong Tianliang sneered. He waved his clawed hand again, and shockingly, the force he delivered this time was actually mixed with a sliver of black-colored energy.

It was very little and very light, but it did indeed exist.

Ling Han shot out a punch, but the force that he had shot out was easily shattered by this force, which continued to blast towards him.

‘Interesting.’

Ling Han threw another punch, and this time, he directly parried the attack.

Puff!

The powerful Qi hit his fist, and finally shattered. However, a small wound also appeared on Ling Han’s fist, blood seeping out.

This destructive power was truly terrifying. If it wasn’t for the fact that Ling Han’s physique was extremely tough, it was very likely that even the bones in his fist would have been shattered.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“How is it?” Hong Tianliang asked proudly.

Ling Han’s interest was piqued, and he asked, “What technique is this?”

“You expect me to tell you?” Hong Tianliang scoffed.

“It’s not like you’re going to lose anything by telling me,” Ling Han said with a smile. “Alright, even if you don’t answer, I can guess a little. There are two possibilities.”

“Firstly, you have cultivated some kind of claw technique. This is the might of a claw technique.”

“Secondly, you have some kind of cultivation technique that can extract higher-level energy to strengthen your attack.”

As he spoke, he kept an eye out for any change in expression on Hong Tianliang’s face. Then, he added, “I guess it’s the second reason.”

Hong Tianliang’s expression involuntarily changed, but he immediately revealed a confident smile. “So what if you guessed? It’s impossible to grasp it!” “Is that so?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

In this short period of time, if he had only been exchanging blows with Hong Tianliang, it was indeed impossible for him to grasp it. However, since this opportunity had been opened for him, allowing him to see a different sky, Ling Han believed that it should only be a matter of time before he grasped this kind of energy.

“Ling Han, hand over the Essence Nurturing Gourd!” Hong Tianliang pursued him closely.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I just let you have the first few moves, buto you really think you’re that awesome?”

He began to counterattack, unleashing his Frequency Attack. As the Demonic Monkey Fists blasted out, they were directly stacked with 20 layers of power.

Peng, peng, peng! This was earth-shattering.

Hong Tianliang was naturally unafraid, and he raised his clawed hands to parry.

Peng, it could be said that this was the first time that a real head-on collision had taken place between the two of them. Fist and claw collided, instantly stirring up the surrounding air, turning into a powerful hurricane.

Hong Tianliang’s expression changed drastically, and he involuntarily stumbled back in retreat. His face instantly flushed red, then paled, and then flushed bright red again, as if he was performing face changing®.

Ling Han didn’t retreat. However, there was another wound on his fist, and it was dripping blood.

In that clash just now, Ling Han could be considered to have completely gained the upper hand in terms of power, but Hong Tianliang had still managed to injure Ling Han’s fist with the help of the mysterious energy. However, it was only the surface, and had not damaged his bones and tendons.

“What?!” Hong Tianliang was filled with disbelief. He was clearly a Second Change, so how could he be so much weaker than Ling Han in terms of power?

“You, you can’t have really reached the second limit of the Meridian Opening Tier!” he said in a trembling voice. Otherwise, it couldn’t be explained why his cultivation level was obviously on the upper hand, yet there was such a large gap in power.

“You guess,” Ling Han said smilingly.

Hong Tianliang pulled himself together. He definitely wouldn’t allow himself to fail.

He charged over again, and as his clawed hands moved, the black-colored energy became even denser.

With Ling Han’s temper, he couldn’t care less. With a wave of his fists, he clashed head-on with Hong Tianliang.

Peng, peng, peng! After several dozen consecutive attacks, Hong Tianliang had no choice but to retreat. This was because even his fingers had been broken. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s fists were also stained with blood. The destructive power of the black energy was indeed great.

However, overall, it was naturally Ling Han who had the upper hand. His fists were only bleeding, and if the battle continued, Hong Tianliang would lose his battle prowess.

Outside, everyone was dumbfounded.

They all thought that Ling Han had relied on a Spirit Tool to kill two Extreme Bone Tier Demonic Beasts. Thus, when Hong Tianliang went over, they believed that Ling Han would definitely lose.

However, only after they had fought did they realize that Ling Han was actually so powerful.

A considerable number of people were swayed. It was possible that Ling Han should be the one who would win.

Hong Tianliang took a deep breath, and adjusted a few of his finger bones. He roared loudly, and instantly, all the blood in his body boiled.

Xiu, with a stomp of his feet, he charged towards Ling Han. With a wave of his clawed hand, the black-coloured energy became even denser.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Hong Tianliang, I have at least three ways to defeat you.”
