Chapter 1666: Suffering the consequences of his own actions

The Empress immediately stopped, turned around, and smiled beautifully at Ling Han. It was like 10,000,000 flowers had bloomed at the same time, indescribably beautiful.

Ling Han couldn’t help but take a step forwards, wrapping his arms around the Empress’s slender waist, and planted a kiss on her red lips.

The Empress responded passionately, her black locks cascading down like a waterfall.

“Those who make a public display of affection will die very fast,” the large black dog mumbled.

“Damn couple[1]!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire remarked next.

“Woof, you dare insult your Grandpa Dog?” The large black dog immediately jumped up, and aimed a bite at the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire.

Pang Zhen’s face was livid. “Are you guys done yet?”

Ling Han paid him no regard at all, and merely kissed his beautiful wife deeply.

“Damn it!” Pang Zhen roared loudly, leaping out and stretching out a hand to grab Ling Han. He was going to kill this man.

But Ling Han did not even raise his head, and very casually flicked out a finger. Suddenly, a flash of Sword Qi swept out, dazzling the skies.

Yet Pang Zhen’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly channeled his full power into defense. Weng, multiple streaks of golden light surged out of his body, forming a shield in front of him, and there was shockingly the character “Pang” on the shield.

Peng, the Sword Qi landed on the shield, and this shield was immediately sliced in half. The might of the Sword Qi did not decrease, and continued to slash out. With a pu, there was a spurt of blood from Pang Zhen’s chest. His whole person had been forced back about 50 meters, his feet creating very deep grooves in the ground, and only then did he stop.

“Wa!” He spat out a mouthful of blood, his face turning completely pale at first before flushing red.

He looked at Ling Han in shock, completely unable to believe what had just happened. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He was just a Great Saint, yet could actually defeat him so easily. This was too unjust.

Wait... could it be!?

His heart involuntarily shuddered. So this young man had cultivated 10,000,000 stars before breaking through to the Genesis Tier? Otherwise, with a gap of more than a minor level, there was definitely no possible way he could have been defeated, and so horribly at that!

Wait, there was that woman as well!

He turned towards the Empress again. This exquisite beauty must have also cultivated 10,000,000 stars before breaking through to the Genesis Tier, and that was why she was strong enough to oppose him.

And this scene also caused the Blue Feather Saint King and the others to kneel down in astonishment.

Indeed, it was just as they had predicted. Once Ling Han advanced into the Great Saint Tier, he would be frighteningly strong. Just ask, who could possibly match him in the entire Ancient Realm?

Only now did Ling Han raise his head. The Empress’s beautiful face bore a red blush, and was so incredibly dazzling that even those Saints felt their hearts throb wildly, though all of them maintained a solemn expression, not daring to show the slightest bit of their emotions.

You had to be joking; Ling Han presently was already strong enough to kill anyone in his way. Who dared to have ideas about his woman? Were they tired of living? Moreover, they were still hoping that Ling Han could bring them into the Celestial Realm.

Pang Zhen gritted his teeth. The Celestial medicine was too attractive, so he was not satisfied to just leave like that. He suddenly drew out a jade pendant, and declared, “If you don’t want to die, hand over the Celestial medicine obediently. Otherwise, when I burst this Forbidden Tool, all of you will have to die!”

He was not just throwing around threats here. This jade pendant had been bestowed on him by his elders, and after bursting, it could release a terrifying power on the level of Pseudo Severing Mundane Tier. No matter even if you were a Saint King, in front of the power of a Pseudo Severing Mundane Tier, your only fate would be being turned into ashes.

“Oh, what item is that?” Ling Han asked, very intrigued.

Pang Zhen felt like he was about to go crazy. Was this the time to be curious what item this was? Why was it so difficult to communicate with this person? He exclaimed, “Don’t force me. This is a Forbidden Tool, and possesses boundless might! All those below the Severing Mundane Tier will die!”

“Just because you say it possesses boundless might, it does? I don’t believe it.” Ling Han shook his head.

‘F*ck!’

A muscle twitched in Pang Zhen’s cheek. He really did not want to use this Forbidden Tool, because when this attack surged out, not only Ling Han would die, even the Empress would also die. He slightly hated to do it. He would really be unable to find another woman of such exquisite beauty.

“Ling Han!” the Blue Feather Saint King and the others called out. Judging by the look of Pang Zhen, he did not seem like he was just pulling a bluff.

“If you have the guts, then just burst it!” Yet Ling Han was still provoking Pang Zhen.

Pang Zhen finally could no longer bear it. In any case, if he could not kill Ling Han, he could not possibly obtain the Empress, either. Since that was the case, if he couldn’t obtain her, then no one should have her, either! Suddenly, he burst the jade pendant.

“Banish!” Ling Han pressed out a hand, and Pang Zhen’s whole person instantly disappeared.

But it was only a moment. Boom, a frightening storm of energy suddenly appeared out of nowhere, sweeping out in all directions. However, it was only peak stage Saint King in power at most, and was completely insufficient to deal a fatal strike against them.

It was very simple. Pang Zhen and that Forbidden Tool had been banished together, but because the might that Forbidden Tool had released was too frightening, it had burst out even when the Banishment period had not ended, but it was also because of this that a large amount of the power had been used on exploding the void, causing the might of the Forbidden Tool to be decreased greatly.

Instead, it was Pang Zhen who suffered. At first, it was impossible that he would also be affected by the might of the Forbidden Tool, because he was in the center. However, who asked him to be banished with it together into a sealed-off space? The violent energy endlessly crashed and ricocheted in the space, and naturally struck him fatally first.

And now, there was really not the slightest bit left of him.

He had suffered the consequences of his own actions!

The Blue Feather Saint King and the others were all gaping with shock. The matter was resolved just like that?

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Now that we’re done, let’s pack up and leave. Everyone, it’s about time that we can return.”

The Saint Kings all nodded in agreement blankly, and felt that everything was so surreal. Only after a long time had passed did they return to their senses. Since Ling Han had become a Great Saint, that meant that they would be able to enter into the Celestial Realm!

They all expressed the desire to return to their own Forbidden Lands and make some preparations, then immediately bring all their clansmen to seek out Ling Han again.

Meanwhile, Ling Han said there was no rush. He would still stay in the Ancient Realm for at least 10 years.

Why? He was going to freeload off the heavenly tribulation of others. He wanted to obtain a great volume of Heavenly Tribulation Fluid before he left.

Everyone returned. Though the Tian Tribe knew that the Celestial medicine had already been plucked, they did not speak a word of it. With the reputation Ling Han had established through his martial feats, who would dare covet something that had already entered his pocket?

Two days later, all the outsiders left the Tian Tribe, and came to the Yuan Tribe where they had first arrived. As long as they had not reached the peak stage of the Saint King Tier, they could cultivate here, and it was definitely capable of boosting their cultivation rate a good few times.

All the Saint Kings left. They had to return as soon as possible to make their preparations for entering the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han also left. He was going to go to the Great Ling Empire, and choose a few people to bring into the Celestial Realm. Before he left, he warned everyone not to be in a rush to break through. No matter what, they had to wait until he returned. In any case, with his current speed, a return trip would only take two years at most.

Everyone naturally agreed, and Ling Han set off. This time, he only brought the Empress with him because the Empress had reached the peak stage of the Medium Saint Tier, and did not need to further increase her Origin Power, and only needed comprehension of cultivation level, so she needed the help of the Reincarnation Tree.

The Empress went into seclusion for comprehension inside the Black Tower, while Ling Han headed towards the Great Ling Empire, stepping on the golden pathway.

This would be his final trip to the Great Ling Empire. If he ever came back, it would definitely be when he returned from the Celestial Realm.
