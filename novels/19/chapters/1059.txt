Chapter 1060: Murderous Aura

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Run!” The members of the assault squad were all transfixed with shock. Who would’ve imagined that there would be several hundred Sun Moon Tier elites in the Golden Lion Nation’s army?

They were nothing but trash before such an overwhelming power!

“You think you can still flee?” Once the Sun Moon Tier elites attacked, there was nothing the Mountain River Tier cultivators could do to resist. They were all suppressed in an instant. Fortunately, the Sun Moon Tier elites weren’t planning to kill them. They merely sealed their cultivation before tossing them aside.

Only Zhao Lun was able to break through the enemy’s overwhelming encirclement. In fact, the armor on his body even allowed him to fly! Coupled with its powerful defenses, even the large number of Sun Moon Tier elites couldn’t defeat and capture him.

Meanwhile, in the chaos of the battle, no one noticed that one other person had also gone missing.

Ling Han had naturally entered the Black Tower to hide.

“Take them away!” an elite ordered. “No one is allowed to disrupt His Majesty’s plans!”

“Understood!”

The battlefield was instantly cleaned up. At the same time, numerous catapults started to wreak havoc among those from the Eastern Rain Nation’s army who hadn’t crossed the furious river yet. At least a quarter of the Eastern Rain Nation’s army was swallowed by the furious river.

The remaining soldiers all turned around to flee, not daring to advance any further.

Who told them to launch an attack without gathering any intelligence on the Golden Lion Nation’s army first? It was only natural that they suffered a heavy defeat.

Fortunately, the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire didn’t plan on starting an all-out war with the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. Thus, their reinforcements only hid on the sidelines, and didn’t massacre the students from the academy, merely capturing them.

It was clear that they had an elaborate scheme.

Ling Han silently watched on from the Black Tower. The elite from before had let his mouth slip, saying, “No one is allowed to disrupt His Majesty’s plans!” Of course, he didn’t know that someone was eavesdropping on him from a hidden place, so his words couldn’t be counted as a slip.

The amount of information conveyed by this sentence was immense.

Sure enough, the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire was behind all of this. In fact, they might have directly ordered the Golden Lion Nation to act as they had.

Ling Han was extremely curious. What on earth did the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire want?

It wasn’t long before the surroundings became quiet.

Ling Han exited the Black Tower and quietly left the battlefield, heading toward the north.

The Eternity Sky Majestic Empire had resolutely seized a large chunk of land, and then used a large army to block access to the furious river. It was clear that they were scheming something in this place. Ling Han wouldn’t be able to gather any more information in this enemy encampment, as it was merely an outpost.

He ventured deeper and deeper into the Eastern Rain Nation, yet he became more startled the deeper he went. This was because the surroundings were deathly silent, with all traces of life exterminated.

Ling Han summoned his Cloud Piercing Shuttle and started to carefully search the land as he speedily zipped through it.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle was incredibly quick, and Ling Han’s eye was also especially sharp. Thus, his search was also extremely quick. He had already finished searching a large swathe of land in a very short amount of time. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The land before him suddenly became crimson as if it had been burned by a heavenly fire.

Weng!

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle suddenly shuddered as if it had been struck.

Ling Han hurriedly landed the shuttle and then stowed it away. He then started to carefully inspect and sense his surroundings.

This expanse of crimson land radiated an overwhelming murderous aura.

‘What is the emperor of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire trying to find here?’ Ling Han thought to himself. ‘And what on earth are they doing to this place? They even turned this stretch of fertile land into a vast expanse of crimson land.’

He walked forward slowly, not daring to let his guard down.

A feeling of danger suddenly gripped his heart. Bursts of murderous aura surged from the ground before him, fusing together and surprisingly forming a humanoid figure.

Boom!

The humanoid figure immediately launched an attack at Ling Han, its arm extending without limit as its fist smashed toward Ling Han’s face.

‘What on earth is this?!’

Ling Han lashed out with his sword, the Fast Technique allowing his strikes to arrive first even though he had attacked later.

Shua, shua, shua!

He performed seven strikes in an instant and sliced the humanoid figure into eight segments.

The humanoid figure dispersed into a misty form once more, yet it instantly started to condense together again. It was as if Ling Han’s sword strikes hadn’t dealt it any damage.

“Interesting...” Ling Han muttered. He waved a hand and summoned the Asura Demon Emperor.

“Oh, Great Master, Little Asura’s claws are already thirsting for blood. Please give your command. Whose bottom do you want Little Asura to bite today?” An obsequious wolf instantly appeared before Ling Han.

‘Holy smokes! It’s only been a few months, yet master has already broken through to the peak stage of the medium extreme. Is he trying to defy the heavens?’

Hu!

The humanoid aura charged over, and once again swung its fist at Ling Han.

“Howl!” The Asura Demon Emperor howled as it lunged toward the enemy.

His battle prowess was at the late stage of the consummate level, so he was able to easily pin the humanoid aura down. He appeared especially smug as he bit and clawed at the blob of murderous aura. ‘You’re so weak, yet you still dare to attack my master. How stupid!’

“Huh?” The Asura Demon Emperor cocked his head in surprise. The blob of murderous aura had actually reformed into a humanoid figure again.

‘Is this an undying cockroach?’

“It’s a bit like you,” Ling Han said.

The Asura Demon Emperor was astonished. He was a being who had been born from the Demonic Qi of Primal Chaos! Although his battle prowess was nothing to write home about, he was still an extremely special existence in the Netherworld—it would be impossible to find another species whose members could become a host in the bodies of all kinds of living beings, dead people, and puppets there.

It was because of this unique ability that the Asura Demon Emperor had been sent to the Immortal Realm to search for the location of the “Lower Realm”.

“Master, this doesn’t seem to be a living being,” he speculated.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “The murderous aura here is particularly strong. There’s an undying will fluctuating through this land, and humanoid figures like this can be formed wherever the murderous aura is denser. These humanoid figures all possess a violent instinct to attack.”

The Asura Demon Emperor was stunned, and said, “Elites like this are far too terrifying. This is merely a shred of his willpower that has leaked out.”

Ling Han stroked his chin as he continued to suppress the humanoid figure, and said, “So, I also want to find out what on earth the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire is trying to do.”

“Master, it’s dangerous to keep going. It’s best that we don’t venture too deeply.” The Asura Demon Emperor was extremely cowardly.

“Don’t worry. If there are any dangers, you can walk ahead and act as my shield,” Ling Han casually replied.

“Ah!” The Asura Demon Emperor’s dog mouth instantly gaped open. His expression was as if he were saying, ‘Master, you can’t screw me over like that!’

Ling Han had tried all kinds of methods, yet this humanoid aura was impossible to kill even though it was extremely easy to smash apart. One could crush it into hundreds or thousands of pieces, yet it would quickly reform itself again. It was as if it were an undying beast.

“Let me try this, then.” He unleashed his divine patterns of flames toward the murderous aura.

Weng!

Ling Han felt as if he heard a wretched wail when the flames blasted over. This wail caused his divine sense to shudder uncomfortably. However, the effects of the divine flames were also extremely obvious, quickly incinerating the humanoid aura into ashes.

Ling Han turned to look at the Asura Demon Emperor, and found that his state was even more miserable than himself. The Asura Demon Emperor had been jolted out of the puppet wolf, and his mist-like body was squirming about continuously.

The murderous aura’s wretched wail was a divine sense attack, yet Ling Han’s divine sense had already been tempered to become extremely sturdy by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Thus, he had only felt a little discomfort. Meanwhile, the Asura Demon Emperor was genuinely at the medium extreme, so his body had been directly jolted out of the puppet wolf’s body.

Interesting.
