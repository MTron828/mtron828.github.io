1517 Precious treasures are a temptation

There was a clue left on the chest. The ancient scriptures of a Celestial King were hidden within. This was something that Ling Han had leaked out. It was a complete lie, and his motive was to attract Gu Daoyi.

‘You come from the Celestial Realm, so you naturally know how awesome a cultivation technique of a Celestial King could be. The Nine Deaths Heaven Art that you’ve cultivated is a Celestial King technique, isn’t it? And now, there is another such cultivation technique in front of you; do you want it?’

Most importantly, whether it was Gu Daoyi or Empress Luan Xing, the Nine Deaths Heaven Art they had obtained was not complete, but an incomplete Heaven Art was treated like a precious treasure by a Severing Mundane Ancestor from the Celestial Realm like Gu Daoyi. Then, how extraordinary would a complete Heaven Art be? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even if Gu Daoyi knew that there was something off, he would definitely venture there. In the face of a precious treasure, it would be difficult not to be tempted.

Not bad, not bad. Though the whole matter of the “treasure trove” could not survive a real examination, it was all right. As long as the treasure trove itself was real, that was fine. As long as Gu Daoyi went, it was all right.

Ling Han was filled with confidence. Even if Gu Daoyi had been gifted a great many treasures by the Star Sand Saint, as long as he used the blood essence of the Star Sand Saint, that would definitely be enough to suppress all of them—unless the Star Sand Saint himself appeared.

He had to waste that drop of blood essence from a Saint King to kill Gu Daoyi; was it a loss?

Of course it wasn’t! This was all the sake for managing to push down his wife! No, no, no, it was for his wife! For the sake of his wife, what was a drop of Saint King blood essence worth?

It was about time for him to set out too. What if Gu Daoyi had already set out, and he just happened to miss him?

“Yi, isn’t that Little Han in front of me?” A voice rang out. Xiu, a strong gale was approaching.

Ling Han suddenly shot out his foot in a kick. “Damn dog, this trick again!”

The large black dog turned around and avoided this kick from Ling Han. “I was warmly greeting you, and you actually greeted me with violence; I have never seen someone like you!”

Ling Han scoffed. If he had not lashed out his foot, he would definitely have got a harsh bite from the large black dog, and this damn dog was actually so shameless to make a false countercharge against him. Indeed, its shamelessness knew no limits.

“Little Black, have you harmed anyone recently?”

“Ptui, I only harm you!” The large black dog glared at Ling Han. Against anyone else, it had always been successful in every endeavor. It was only against Ling Han that it never really enjoyed the upper hand, which made it feel slightly depressed and also extremely defiant.

“I can’t be bothered to deal with you; I still have something to do!” Ling Han headed out of the academy.

“Do you want to commit murder or arson? Don’t forget about Grandpa Dog if you have something good!” The large black dog was in high spirits.

Ling Han gave it a look. This damn dog was indeed the type to wish for the whole world to be in chaos.

They walked boldly out of the academy. Though many students saw them, not one of them stepped out to stop them.

There was no need to mention Ling Han. Ling Han’s abilities were well-known through battles, even senior brothers in the high extreme of the Eternal River Tier had still been harshly defeated. If those in consummate level did not appear, who could match him? In fact, everyone suspected that if the big shots did not move out, even ordinary elites in the consummate level could do nothing against him.

The large black dog, meanwhile, had a strong reputation for playing cheap tricks.

It never went into a head-on confrontation with anyone. If anyone offended it—for example, insulted it—it would knock on the person’s door in the middle of the night, and create a disturbance in various ways. It could even throw poop on you. That was how sinister and vicious it could be.

Furthermore, it was extremely slippery, and no one could catch up to it. Thus, everyone was more willing to fight with Ling Han. At worst, they would only be beaten harshly, but going against the large black dog would mean a serious ravaging of their spirits.

There was once a senior brother who had taught them a lesson through his own mistakes. He had once announced that he would dump the large black dog into a stew and eat its flesh. And what happened? He was so horribly disturbed by the large black dog that he directly withdrew from the academy!

A fierce character and a despicable character was walking alongside each other; who dared approach them to ask for trouble!

When they arrived outside, Ling Han drew out the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. The large black dog forced its way on board. With a clang, its iron underwear crashed onto the seat, creating sparks.

“F***, if you break it, you’ll compensate with your life!” Ling Han exclaimed with a glare.

“So petty!” The large black dog acted as if it had not heard him, and even moved its behind to find a more comfortable position.

Ling Han looked at it with a strange look in his eyes.

“Brat, what kind of eyes are you having? It’s very dangerous!” The large black dog felt like its fur was about to stand on ends.

Ling Han snickered, and replied, “It won’t take too long, and I will introduce someone to you.”

The large black dog felt strange. ‘Just go ahead with the introduction; Grandpa Dog has never shrunk back from anyone in this lifetime.’

Ling Han did not say anything else, and maneuvered the Cloud Piercing Shuttle into the skies. When the large black dog met Hu Niu in future, only then would it know that there would always be someone better than it. When the despicable dog met the glutton, it would only become a dead dog.

Sigh, he really missed that little girl quite a bit.

The Cloud Piercing Shuttle rose up into the skies. Xiu, it pierced through the air, and in a short while, it arrived on the planet where the corpses of the three Phoenix Kings were. At this time, there were already a great many people surrounding the chariot.

Even if they did not use such a high-grade item like the Cloud Piercing Shuttle, it would only take three to four days to come here from Wood Figure Planet.

Everyone was lining up to try opening the chest on the chariot, but even Ling Han had only managed to open it after exerting his full effort, so even if big shots like Ren Feiyun had come, they might not be able to successfully open it, either.

It was not a matter of power, but rather that the chest itself was too heavy. Whose physique could sustain opening it? If one attempted to open it by force, it would only cause one’s fingers to break one after another.

If one couldn’t do it, then try two. If two still couldn’t, then try it with three. But no matter how many people there were, the chest was only so big. How could it allow so many people to lay their hands on it at the same time?

But the more they were unable to open it, the more curious everyone was. They were sure that supreme precious treasures were hidden within.

Ling Han knew that Gu Daoyi was a Divine Fetus. Though his physique was not as strong as his own, he could still distribute the force among all his doppelgangers. Thus, Gu Daoyi was definitely able to open this chest.

Come quickly!

Ling Han sat in a cross-legged position. He had always had great patience.

Yet the large black dog was restless. It circled around on its two back legs, its iron underwear reflecting light, and presenting a dazzling sight. However, it did not feel ashamed in the slightest, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, clapping a paw on others’ shoulders everywhere it went.

Whoever received a clap from it would definitely get so much of a scare that their spirit was about to flee their bodies. This was the Despicable King of the eighth campus. Whoever became its target would be very unfortunate.

Meanwhile, the large black dog snickered secretly. It was deliberately trying to scare them.

After two days, the Empress sent him a message from inside the Black Tower. She had already digested the medicinal effects of the Saintly medicine, and her present cultivation level had reached the late stage of the low extreme.

Her rate of improvement was faster than Ling Han’s because she had additionally refined a piece of Saintly Origin.

However, Ling Han felt that the Empress’s rate of advancement was still too slow. The best scenario would be if she could immediately advance into the Saint level.

He did not allow the Empress and the others to appear. This time, he was planning to kill Gu Daoyi with a trap, so the less people appeared, the easier it’d be to avoid making any mistakes. If they were really exposed, he would flee via the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. In any case, his main motive of being in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy was for the cultivation resources. He did not lack cultivation techniques.

Of course, Ling Han still had a positive opinion of the Tranquil Heart Saint. After all, he had granted him a favor of guidance.

Time passed day after another. The chariot and chest attracted the attention of more and more people. Elites swarmed around it, and even such big shots like Ren Feiyun and Qi Tian had also arrived. Not only the eighth campus; the other campuses had also moved out upon hearing the news, and rushed over here.

By now, no one cared where the news had come from. With the treasured chest in front of them, what they were the most concerned about was how they could obtain the treasures hidden within.

“Ling Han!” Qi Tian and Cai Miao glared at him at the same time. They had never forgotten him. No matter how much honor Ling Han had gained for the eighth campus, traditions could not be abolished!

Ling Han laughed, and asked, “You guys want a fight?”
