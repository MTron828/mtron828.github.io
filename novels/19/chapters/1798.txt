Chapter 1799: Rabbit or Celestial Medicine?

Blood Dragon Stones were extremely valuable cultivation items that could help one rapidly comprehend their cultivation level.

Although Blood Dragon Stones were of the fire element, the fact that they were at the level of the great dao meant that they possessed intricate links with all other elements. Thus, even cultivators who didn’t practice techniques of the fire element could use Blood Dragon Stones to comprehend the great dao. It was just that the effect would be slightly inferior compared to those who practiced techniques of the fire element.

However, Blood Dragon Stones couldn’t be refined in one swift go, and one needed to slowly extract their essence bit by bit. The process was similar to that of refining Star Stones.

Now, however?

With a simple touch, Ling Han had instantly caused a Blood Dragon Stone to disintegrate into and turn ashes. Not a single trace of it was left.

One had to realize that refining Blood Dragon Stones would usually result in a pile of scraps. Moreover, these scraps were the materials used to make the Blood Dragon Armor. Otherwise, even Immortal Palace Tier elites wouldn’t be able to enter this mystery realm. Without the Blood Dragon Armor, they were only capable of wandering around the outer regions of the plain.

“Is this because of the Flame Control Technique? Or is it because of the Nine Heavens Flame?” Ling Han asked as he looked toward the Empress.

“We can only find out after obtaining another Blood Dragon Stone,” the Empress replied.

They continued to advance, and after four or so hours, they were blessed by the god of fortune again. They came across another Blood Dragon Stone.

This time, it was the Empress who picked it up. However, unlike with Ling Han, the Blood Dragon Stone didn’t disintegrate and turn into ashes.

The Empress then activated the Flame Control Technique, and the Blood Dragon Stone rapidly shrunk at a rate that was visible to the naked eye. However, it still left a layer of a “shell”.

This speed of refinement was far superior to that of other cultivators, though it was still incomparable to Ling Han’s.

“Sure enough, everything is related to that Celestial King,” Ling Han and the Empress said with certainty.

It was because of his Nine Heavens Flame that Ling Han was able to refine the Blood Dragon Stone quicker and more comprehensively.

“Bewitching Maiden Rou... will definitely discover this phenomenon as well,” Ling Han murmured. As long as she obtained a Blood Dragon Stone, Bewitching Maiden Rou would immediately discover that she could refine it countless times quicker than before.

Moreover, what kind of place was the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm?

According to rumors, it was the ruin of a Celestial King Tier force.

With Bewitching Maiden Rou’s intelligence, she would be bringing shame to her title of Holy Daughter if she couldn’t discover the link between the two matters.

Ling Han and the Empress continued to advance. This time, however, they didn’t make a conscious effort to search for Blood Dragon Stones. After all, once they confirmed the relationship between this mystery realm and the Celestial King, they would be able to do far more things.

For example... they could directly go to the volcano and start digging there...

Since Ling Han could ignore the Regulation of Flames here, he could naturally enter the depths of the volcano to obtain more Blood Dragon Stones.

Perhaps this mystery realm even contained cultivation techniques and other inheritances of the Celestial King.

“Stop! Stop! Hurry up and enter Grandpa Dog’s bowl!” This exclamation instantly caught Ling Han’s and the Empress’ attention.

It was the large black dog again!

A white figure and a red figure were rapidly dashing about in the distance. The white figure in front was a rabbit, and its entire body was covered in white fur. Meanwhile, its eyes were ruby red.

With a skip and a hop, it continued to bounce away from the figure chasing it. At the same time, it didn’t let go of the carrot in its hands.

Behind this rabbit was the large black dog, and because of the crimson red armor, his entire body was covered in red. Moreover, because he could only sprint on his hind legs, his movements looked extremely strange and uncanny.

“Little rabbit, you can’t escape!” the large black dog exclaimed as he activated a teleportation technique, and instantly blocked the rabbit’s path. There was a creepy smile on his face, and for those who weren’t familiar with him, it was as if he wanted to commit some unspeakable crime against the rabbit.

The white rabbit ground to a sudden halt before turning around and bouncing away in another direction.

“Sh*tty rabbit, you’re Grandpa Dog’s dinner!” the large black dog shouted as he hurriedly chased after the rabbit again. His tongue was hanging out, and drool was flying all over the place.

‘When did this detestable dog become a glutton?’

Ling Han stroked his chin in thought. Perhaps being a glutton was also infectious?

The large black dog was incredibly quick, and it could be said that his speed was already peerless among those at the Severing Mundane Tier. With a few teleportations, he quickly caught up to the large white rabbit again. He then lunged over and tried to bite down.

However, the large white rabbit managed to escape from his maw. Thereupon, the game of chase and escape resumed again. After several repetitions, the large white rabbit couldn’t help but become angry, and its ruby-red eyes started to burn with flames.

When the large black dog successfully blocked its path again, the large white rabbit didn’t turn around to flee. Instead, it furiously opened its mouth. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

An astonishing sight appeared. The rabbit’s mouth widened to at least 30 meters in size, and it transformed into something akin to a black hole. With a swoosh, it bent down and gobbled the large black dog up.

The large white rabbit’s mouth then returned to normal size, upon which it raised its carrot and started to nibble on it.

It looked as harmless as could be.

‘This...!’

Ling Han and the Empress were astounded. Just then, the large white rabbit had still looked like a weak and helpless victim. In the blink of an eye, however, it had suddenly unleashed a terrifying might and gobbled the large black dog up.

Had the large black dog been killed?

After a brief moment, an expression of disgust spread across the large white rabbit’s face. It opened its mouth to spit something out.

Pu!

A blob of matter flew out and started to rapidly expand. This was none other than the large black dog!

The large white rabbit then turned around, quickly disappearing into the distance with a bounce and a hop.

“You sh*tty rabbit, don’t let Grandpa Dog capture you. Otherwise, I’ll steam you and roast you!!” the large black dog shouted as he jumped around in frustration. His Blood Dragon Armor was damaged and messy, and it was clear just how powerful the large white rabbit’s digestion ability was.

This was definitely due to the power of Regulations. Otherwise, the Blood Dragon Armor was completely able to rival the properties of Two-Star Pseudo Divine Metal with its hardness and toughness. However, because it was impossible to cut and fuse Blood Dragon Stones, it was naturally impossible to forge Pseudo-Celestial Tools with them.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and say, “Little Black, it’s such a rare sight to see you suffering at the hands of others.”

“Pei, Grandpa Dog will definitely raid the burrow of that rabbit!” the large black dog shouted. He then turned to Ling Han, and said, “Brat, are you interested in teaming up with me? Did you truly think that was a rabbit?”

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this. “What? Don’t tell me that was a Celestial medicine?”

“Hehe, did you think Grandpa Dog would be so shallow? Did you think I would go to such lengths for a snack?” the large black dog said in disdain.

“If you’re not shallow, who is?” Ling Han said with laughter.

“Piss off! Do you know how to chat properly?” the large black dog said in contempt.

“Since it’s Celestial medicine, let’s chase after it together,” Ling Han said in eagerness.

They started to follow the large white rabbit’s trails. The large black dog’s nose was extremely sensitive, and it was without a doubt that he was a born thief. After two hours or so, they finally caught up to the large white rabbit. It was squatting on a small hill, and happily nibbling on the carrot in its hands.

When Ling Han had first seen the rabbit, the carrot in its hands had been one foot long. Despite the rabbit chewing on it for so long, the carrot was still strangely the same length.

“Fool, the true body of this Celestial medicine is a valuable ginseng. The rabbit is merely a temporary body that it’s summoned,” the large black dog said. As if it understood everything, it continued, “Tsk, tsk, tsk. However, this Celestial medicine has undergone some unexpected changes. It surprisingly possesses a powerful engulfing ability. Perhaps it’s absorbed two Regulations at once?”

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily lit up. The ability to engulf things was an extremely powerful Regulation. In fact, this was an ability that would allow one to engulf all other Regulations.

Engulfing was equivalent to absorbing, and this was completely different from pure defense.

“What’s the other regulation?” Ling Han asked.

“It’s a lightning element Regulation,” the large black dog replied. “Otherwise, without the speed of lightning, how could it have fled from Grandpa Dog for so long? Grandpa Dog isn’t boasting, but my speed is unrivaled among those below the level of Celestial King!”

‘You’re boasting a little too much, no?’

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered retorting him, and he said, “Do you have any good plan?”

“Of course!” the large black dog said with a nod. “Rush over and capture the rabbit!”

‘F*ck! Isn’t that nonsense?!’
