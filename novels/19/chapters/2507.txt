Chapter 2508: Obtaining Divine Metal

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The eyes of the man with the gray hat widened in shock and disbelief. He had actually been killed by his own weapon?

The butt of the spear hadn’t been decorated with symbols of slaughter, so being injured by it should only have resulted in ordinary flesh wounds. Yet, the man felt a terrifying aura crashing through his body, obliterating his life force and causing him to become weaker and weaker.

He was on the verge of death.

However, he was going to die a confused death! How could a measly Hidden Radiance Stage brat possibly be so powerful? Even if the brat were at the same cultivation level as him, he still couldn’t have been so powerful. Unless… he was a Celestial King!

However, did the Duplicate Moon Sect have a second Celestial King?

Before he could finish this thought, he lost his consciousness forever.

Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to this as he continued to stride forward. To him, this was nothing more than a slight disturbance. After all, who had told that person to attack him without a single word?

“Lord Miu has been killed!”

“Not good! Lord Miu has been killed!”

The camp instantly descended into chaos upon realizing that the man with the gray cap had been killed. They all ran around like headless chooks.

A group of Ascending Origin Tier elites charged over, wearing expressions of fury as they glared at Ling Han. However, none of them attacked.

They hadn’t noticed any signs of battle over here just then, yet the man with the gray hat had suddenly been killed. Was Ling Han too powerful?

Thus, they naturally couldn’t attack him recklessly.

......

“Sir, who are you?” someone asked in a solemn voice.

Ling Han ignored his question. He arrived at the face of the mountain, yet he didn’t stop there. Instead, he continued to stride forward.

The elites all sneered upon seeing this.

This was a mine that the two powerful Celestial Kings had been fighting over for a long time. Why was this? This was because this mine contained precious metallic elements that could be extracted and refined into precious ores that were only inferior to Divine Metal.

It was also because of this that the mountain here was unbelievably solid and sturdy. To say nothing of Ascending Origin Tier cultivators, even Celestial Kings could only blast a small opening in the mountain with their full strength.

Yet, this person wanted to crash through the mountain just like that?

What an utter fool!

However, in the next instant, their eyes bulged out in deep shock.

Like a steel ox entering water, Ling Han slowly pushed into the mountain.

It wasn’t that the mountain wall had become water, but rather that Ling Han was like an indestructible weapon that could brutally carve into the mountain. Shards of rock and dust continued to rain down. This was a sign of Ling Han’s immense power. He had shattered the mountain wall with his brute strength.

This was far too terrifying. He wasn’t moving quickly at all, and he was simply striding forward at a leisurely pace. Yet, he had still managed to cause such frightening destruction to the mountain. Just how explosive was his power?

Everyone trembled upon seeing this. They naturally didn’t dare to attack at this moment. After all, charging over would be seeking death.

Ling Han had activated his Body Art, which was something tempered by the Void Particle Energy, the fundamental power of the Genesis World. Even a small movement could unleash a devastating destructive power. Thus, he was able to easily crash through the mountain.

He continued to stride forward at a leisurely pace. Others needed to expend a great deal of effort to mine this area, yet he could easily stroll around in a casual manner.

When his body completely vanished into the mountain, the group of elites finally exhaled in relief.

“What should we do?” they asked as they exchanged glances. They could all see the cold sweat on each other’s foreheads.

“There’s no way we can stop this person, so we had better report this matter to the sect master.”

“Mm-hm!”

Someone immediately returned to the Red Flower Sect to deliver this information. The Red Flower Sect wasn’t far from here, so it only took two days for the sect master of the Red Flower Sect to appear at the mine.

Even though the sect was called the Red Flower Sect, the sect master wasn’t actually a woman. Instead, it was a burly man who had a head of messy hair. He was also bare-chested. Who would have imagined at a glance that he was a calculating and scheming person? Who would have imagined that he had laid a trap that would take tens of millions of years to discover?

Even though he was already aware of the situation, he was still astonished when he saw the cave carved out by Ling Han.

The sect master of the Red Flower Sect reached over and placed a hand on the mountain wall.

Crumble…

A large area of the mountain wall instantly transformed into sand that fell to the floor.

“Sect Master is so mighty!” the elites instantly exclaimed in delight upon seeing this. This greatly increased their morale.

The sect master of the Red Flower Sect also smiled faintly. However, his mind was filled with shock.

Even though his attack had appeared casual, only he knew that he had expended a great deal of energy.

However, according to his subordinates, that mysterious person hadn’t unleashed a single attack at all. Instead, he had walked in head-first just like that. Even so, he had still caused the mountain wall to crumble.

With such a comparison, the sect master immediately knew that his strength was far inferior. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Where had the Duplicate Moon Sect found such a formidable person?

At this moment, he had thoughts of abandoning this mine. However, he was also unwilling to do this, especially since he had already schemed for so long. Moreover, was he going to give up without even seeing his opponent’s face?

At the very least… he would wait until Ling Han came out to make a decision.

These thoughts raced through his mind.

Meanwhile, Ling Han continued to casually stroll around the mine, searching for Divine Metal.

In fact, this entire mountain was formed from Origin Metal, and it contained an astonishing amount of high-level precious metals.

This was as expected of a high-level dimension. In the Celestial Realm, the next step down from Divine Metal was Godly metal. There was no other transition metal, and one could only forge Godly metal into Pseudo-Divine Metal. Here, however, such transition metals existed. Under a more powerful heaven and earth, the precious metals here were far superior in quality to Godly metal.

Thus, it was indeed possible for Divine Metal to exist here.

Divine Metal was naturally at the Celestial King Tier, so it possessed a particular wavelength that Ling Han was currently scanning for. However, the precious metals greatly affected Ling Han’s divine sense, so this severely limited the size of the area that he could scan.

His progress wasn’t quick, and the mountain was also far too large. Who knew where the Divine Metal was? Perhaps it didn’t exist at all!

However, Ling Han was unhurried as he continued to advance. This was Divine Metal, after all, something that all Celestial Kings dreamed of obtaining. If it could be obtained so easily, would it still be rare and coveted? F*ck!

Just as he was thinking this, he suddenly discovered a green ore that was as big as a fist.

It was clearly extraordinary at first glance, and it exuded a dense Celestial Qi. Perhaps even Ascending Origin Tier elites wouldn’t be able to near this ore, or else they would directly be obliterated by the powerful aura that surrounded it.

Divine Metal!

Ling Han was astonished. He had just been thinking about the rarity of Divine Metal, and before he could even finish this thought, a piece had suddenly appeared before him.

“I should be ecstatic, right?” Ling Han said with a laugh. He picked up the piece of Divine Metal.

He didn’t plan to feed this piece of Divine Metal to his Divine Demon Sword, nor did he plan to forge it into a weapon. Instead… he was going to forge it into a Spatial God Tool!

No, a Spatial Celestial Tool!

In terms of forging Divine Metal, unless it was a Heavenly Venerate, did they need to worry about destroying the Divine Metal?

Ever since the Black Tower had fallen quiet, Ling Han had always been worried about how he would protect and hide those around him. This was because intense battles would damage Spatial God Tools. This caused him to be extremely anxious when he battled, and he was often unable to focus his full attention on his battles.

“This is truly a huge help.”

With a smile, he turned around to leave.

The latest_epi_sodes are on_the ʟɪʙʀᴇᴀᴅ.ᴄᴏᴍ. website.

Even though he could forcefully carve out another path to leave, that would consume his energy, after all, so was there any need to do that?

After a few hours, he exited the cave from the path that he had created.

Ling Han instantly felt a powerful aura surge over. He involuntarily looked over, only to see a burly and messy Second Heaven Celestial King.

‘The sect master of the Red Flower Sect?’

Ling Han’s first reaction was an urge to laugh. However, he knew that it was disrespectful to laugh about other people’s appearance, so he forcefully suppressed this urge. However, he still couldn’t help but steal a few extra glances at the Celestial King.

The other man truly brought shame to the title of Celestial King.

The sect master of the Red Flower Sect was also sizing up Ling Han. He became even more astounded. He clearly couldn’t detect a formidable aura of Regulations around Ling Han—this person was genuinely at the Hidden Radiance Stage.

However, this was simply impossible!

In the next moment, his attention was instantly drawn to the green Divine Metal in Ling Han’s hand.

“Give me back my Divine Metal!”
