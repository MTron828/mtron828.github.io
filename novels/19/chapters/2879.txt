2880 Xin Qihu Arrives

Large amounts of life essence surged into Ling Han’s body, pushing his cultivation level further by a small margin.

After all, Nalan De was a Fourth Tier, which was equivalent to two or three green Great Herbs.

“Uh, I’ll take my leave!”

“I have something on too. I’ll take my leave first.”

!!

“I don’t have anything to do with the vein of ore anyway, so I won’t waste time.”

In an instant, most of the people had left. Everyone was afraid that Ling Han would suddenly make a move. This guy could even insta-kill a Fourth Tier cultivator. This was too terrifying.

Previously, although everyone had known that Ling Han had been strong, they had believed that they could’ve still contended against him if they had joined forces. However, now that they had seen that even Nalan De had been instantly killed, they were horrified and shocked. They knew that the difference in strength between them and Ling Han was too great.

Ling Han didn’t stop them. He naturally wouldn’t take these people seriously.

However, very quickly, someone walked over, and said, “Ling Han, you have to be careful. Nalan De has an elder brother, and he’s a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate!”

Although Fifth Tier was only one level higher than Fourth Tier, the strength could be said to have improved by leaps and bounds.

Ling Han was astounded. These two brothers were both Heavenly Venerates, and one was in the Fourth Tier, while the other was in the Fifth Tier. This was a little shocking. Could it be that their old man was in the Seventh Tier?

He asked that person in detail, but the answer he received was not what he had anticipated. The two brothers were actually from a very ordinary background, and they had relied on their own hard work to reach their current heights.

If it had to be said, it was Nalan De’s elder brother, Nalan Xiong, who had taken great care of his younger brother. Otherwise, Nalan De shouldn’t have been able to reach the Fourth Tier, or at least not so quickly.

Nalan Xiong was currently exploring a palace here with others. It had long been reduced to ruins. However, the fact that everything else here had been destroyed, but there was still a palace left behind was enough to prove how extraordinary this palace was.

Perhaps it was the palace of a Seventh Tier that contained an astonishing inheritance.

Ling Han nodded at that person, and said, “Thank you.”

That person smiled, and said, “I am Yang Po, and I hope to be able to meet Brother Ling again in the future.” He wanted to form a good relationship with Ling Han, and perhaps it would be of great use in the future. Moreover, he would only be gaining from this at no cost to himself. It was just a piece of information or a clue, and there was no need for him to pay any price.

“No problem.” Ling Han accepted this favor.

Soon, only Ling Han, his son, and his grandson remained in the canyon.

Ling Han continued to open stones. With his stone searching ability to “see,” the speed at which he opened the stones was naturally astonishing. Very quickly, he had completely mined the entire vein of ore, and his harvest was astonishing.

There were a total of seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, 13 Great Herbs, countless pieces of Divine Metal, and one piece of Devouring Metal.

Ling Han planned to specially use Great-Accomplishment-level Devouring Metal to create a spatial tool which would be augmented with the Heavenly Venerate Technique to form an ultimate defense.

It wasn’t that a separate dimension could not be created in the interior of the Divine Demon Sword, just like the Black Tower back then. However, a precious tool that focused on offense was definitely not as good in defense as one that specialized in defense.

Ling Han collected five of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, and the remaining two were given to Ling Jianxue and his son. The Great Herbs were all given to Ling Han’s son and grandson. With the abilities he possessed, obtaining Great Herbs could be said to be as easy as flipping his hand.

Ling Jianxue and his son didn’t return to the base, but continued to explore. The discovery of this dimension, or rather, this overlapped dimension, was like a huge treasure that had been bestowed to all the Heavenly Venerates, and everyone could benefit from it.

It was now or never.

Meanwhile, Ling Han returned. He wanted to upgrade the newly obtained Devouring Metal, refine it into a precious treasure of Heavenly Venerable Tier, and bring Bewitching Maiden Rou, Liu Yutong, and the others over as well.

He walked forward, and every step he took would bring him to an endless distance. Heavenly Venerates ignored Regulations, and there were no Regulations here. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could exert extraordinary speed.

After walking for three days, Ling Han’s heart suddenly stirred, and he stopped in his tracks.

“Come, have a cup of tea with me.” A vigorous and domineering voice rang out.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Drinking tea depends on the person. As for you… I don’t seem to be very interested in joining you for tea.”

There was a pavilion up ahead, and in the pavilion, there was a person drinking tea. His white clothes fluttered in the wind, and he was a handsome man.

It was Xin Qihu.

“Hahaha!” Xin Qihu laughed loudly. “You’re indeed very bold. You have to know that even Fourth Tiers are nothing in front of me. They don’t even dare to breathe loudly.”

“Congratulations, you’ve met your match,” Ling Han said calmly.

“My match? Not really.” Xin Qihu shook his head. “If you were in the Fourth Tier, I might be able to view you as an opponent, but a mere Second Tier? I’m only here to kill you.”

“Oh, do you dare to fight me at the same cultivation level?” Ling Han provoked.

“Ling Han, with the height that I have reached, will provocation be effective on me?” Xin Qihu asked with a smile. He was already publicly acknowledged as the greatest prodigy of all eternity, and could not be elevated any further. He also did not have to worry about falling off the pedestal. How could he act on impulse?

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Then what nonsense are you talking about? Let’s fight!”

“You should have accepted my kind offer and helped me find veins of ore.” Xin Qihu shook his head, appearing to be a little regretful. “Unfortunately, not only did you not agree, you even killed one of my men. Therefore, you must die!”

He made a move. Boom! With a flip of his right hand, the sky trembled, and countless heavenly bodies were born and destroyed in his hands. One exhalation was equivalent to 10,000 lifetimes, describing the various wonders of the universe, and displaying his comprehension of “Dao.”

This was definitely the battle prowess of a Fifth Tier. As the might flowed, Ling Han didn’t even need to face it head-on to know that he was definitely not a match for it.

It couldn’t be helped. The two of them were two whole cultivation levels apart, and Xin Qihu was the greatest prodigy of all eternity. In a battle of the same cultivation level, even if his strength was inferior to Ling Han’s, he wouldn’t be much weaker. How could Ling Han possibly be a match for him?

Without any hesitation, Ling Han immediately drew out his broken saber. Hong! A murderous aura surged out, striking towards Xin Qihu.

This exceeded Xin Qihu’s expectations, and he was instantly struck by the murderous aura. Because this was not a strike of force, its speed was much faster, and he was caught off guard.

This murderous aura was too terrifying. It was formed from the endless slaughter of a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, and had definitely drunk a large amount of Sixth-Tier blood. Even a peerless prodigy like Xin Qihu could not help but grunt, and the space between his brows immediately split open, causing a stream of blood to flow out.

Ling Han sighed. If he was currently in the Third Tier, then he would still be qualified to fight with Xin Qihu. Even if he was no match for Xin Qihu, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to escape. However, if he was in the Second Tier, that wouldn’t do. If he went up to fight, he would definitely be instantly killed.

He turned around and left.

“Ling Han!” Xin Qihu’s furious roar came from behind. He had already recovered and was chasing after Ling Han.

As expected of an absolute elite of Fourth Tier. His speed was too high, and even though he was affected by the murderous aura of the broken saber, the effect only lasted an instant.

“Xin Qihu, I’ll spare your life this time. When I cultivate to the Fourth Tier, watch how I fight a tiger.” Ling Han laughed, and the broken saber struck out again1. Xiu! Another saber strike was sent out, and the saber light turned into one 30,000 meters long.

Xin Qihu launched a furious punch. Peng! The Saber Qi instantly crumbled. However, he let out another muffled groan as a bloody wound appeared on his fist.

It turned out that this slash not only had the power of the broken saber itself, but it also had an additional murderous aura. Thus, although Xin Qihu had dissolved the Saber Qi with one punch, his hand was still injured by the Saber Qi.

He was filled with hatred. Ever since he had started cultivating, how many times had he been injured? What more when he was injured by an ant whose cultivation level was inferior to his own.

...

His gaze was cold, and his face was filled with killing intent.
