1268 The Most Idiotic Threa

It had just reached 300,000,000, and he directly added another 10,000,000. This was to suppress others with his aura, and thus successfully obtain the treasure.

Xie Donglai’s face was filled with arrogance. Were these peasants even qualified to compete with him?

He was the prince of the Xie Clan, enjoying a considerable status. Furthermore, he had even led out his own troops in battle some days ago, and ransacked a few bandit lairs, obtaining an astonishing wealth from his efforts. After he had sold off some God Tools and materials, the number of True Origin Stones he had in his possession was close to 400,000,000!

It seemed like even the heavens were helping him. Initially, his reason for coming to the Two Realm Battlefield was to bring back that b**** that had fled the marriage. He had not thought that he would actually find a palm-sized Realm Spirit Stone.

With his natural talent, if he refined this Realm Spirit Stone, he would have 30% chance of advancing into the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, and had a 99% chance of breaking through into the Heavenly Body Tier.

That was right. The pinnacle level was even harder to cultivate than a major tier. A 30% chance was already quite good.

He had thought thus: if he could attempt to reach the pinnacle level, he naturally would make the attempt, but if he was unable to succeed even with such a large Realm Spirit Stone, he would put an end to those thoughts, and aim directly for breakthrough to the Heavenly Body Tier.

After all, even on the Cloud Apex Planet, there was an extremely limited number of elites of the Heavenly Body Tier. After he broke through to this cultivation level, he would really be qualified to be called as an elite, and would be respected wherever he went.

Of course, all this was based on the prerequisite that he could obtain the Realm Spirit Stone.

But he was confident. Was close to 400,000,000 True Origin Stones not enough?

“330,000,000!” A female voice rang out. It was not loud, but was very clearly transmitted into everyone’s ears.

Everyone was shocked. Who was this? She was really too wealthy, wasn’t she? She directly added another 20,000,000to the bid. She was really much more generous than Xie Donglai.

Yet both Ling Han and Jin Xuan shook.

This was the voice of the woman who had slapped Jin Xuan.

In the previous bidding, she had never made a move, and it was only now that she spoke for the first time. She was obviously here for the Realm Spirit Stone. Furthermore, what was stranger was that though this voice was very clear, it was completely impossible to trace it back to its source. They had no way of distinguishing which room this voice had originated from.

Xie Donglai humphed coldly, and continued bidding. “335,000,000!”

Internally, he was displeased. He thought that he had suddenly increased the bid just now, which should have completely intimidated everyone else. Why had there appeared another person that was even more generous than he? She directly added another 20,000,000... That was 20,000,000, and not 200 True Origin Stones she had added.

“350,000,000,” the woman stated calmly, sounding absolutely nonchalant.

“355,000,000!” Xie Donglai uttered through gritted teeth. A feeling of foreboding vaguely rose up inside his heart. Could it be that he would be losing? Damn it, if he did not have this Realm Spirit Stone, then his hopes of breaking through to the pinnacle level were practically zero, and his advancement to becoming an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier would also have to be delayed by several or even ten thousand years.

No, he had to get hold of it!

“370,000,000.” The woman was still as undisturbed as previously.

“390,000,000!” Xie Donglai called out loudly, and was extremely generous for once. However, this was all his wealth, and if the other party increased the bid further, he could only raise his hands in surrender.

However, he was determined to obtain it. Hence, he added, “Milady, I am the grandson of the Great General Xie, so please give way to me just this once for the sake of the Great General Xie. I will definitely repay you for it!”

This was an outright threat. If you dared compete with me further, that would be making an enemy out of the Great General Xie!

“What a joke. I do not take even Xie Qian seriously, so who do you think you are?” A cold humph was heard, and a delicate hand as fair as jade appeared, striking out at Xie Donglai.

“Not good!” When two old servants saw this, their expressions drastically changed. They both jumped out, wanting to disperse this blow for Xie Donglai, but they had not even come close enough when a terrifying aura rolled over them. Peng, peng, both of them were sent flying.

Xie Donglai paled in shock, yet he did not even have the chance to put up a defense. Pa, his face had already suffered a heavy blow. His whole body was suddenly sent flying out, and crashed down from the third floor with a bang, falling right into the auction hall downstairs.

“Who is it that dares to make trouble in our Gold Origin Auction House?” Jin Ming roared out angrily, and then charged towards the third floor. Peng, peng, peng. A series of bangs rand out, but after a while, silence resumed, which was followed by Jin Ming saying in a respectful tone, “Yes, yes, it’s fine. Hehe, as long as Milady has fun!”

This was heard from the fourth floor. He retreated out of the room, his waist bent, copious amounts of cold sweat dripping down from his face.

Fourth floor!

Heaven Room, which meant an elite of the Eternal River Tier!

No wonder, no wonder. This mysterious woman dared boast that “I do not take even Xie Qian seriously” because she, too, was a being of that level.

However, Xie Donglai felt incredibly wronged. ‘Since you are an elite of Eternal River Tier, why didn’t you boldly reveal your identity? If I had known that your voice had come from the fourth floor, I would not have dared to stand against you even if it killed me.’

Yet did he dare to bring her to account for it?

He had really suffered this loss for nothing. Furthermore, he had to turn around and beg the other party for forgiveness. Why? That was because he actually dared to threaten an elite of the Eternal River Tier.

“The auction continues,” Jin Ming announced, not sparing another look at Xie Donglai.

The auction did continue, but after the matter just now, everyone was still stunned, so how could there be anyone who would place another bid? Furthermore, this price was already overwhelmingly high, so there were not that many people that could afford to increase the bid.

The mysterious woman increased the bid to 400,000,000, and no one else competed with her. Hence, she successfully bought the climax treasure.

The auction ended, and the successful buyers went backstage to make payment and complete the transaction.

Though Ling Han had not bought anything, he was the biggest seller this time round. Thus, he naturally had to go backstage as well to accept payment.

Because the number involved was too large, he had to wait until the mysterious woman completed the transaction to be able to have enough True Origin Stones to pay. Thus, he could only wait for now, and watch from the sidelines.

After a while, a fragrance spread out. After that, a woman dressed in a full suit of armor walked out. She looked to be in her early thirties, yet was still beautiful, having the bearing of a mature woman. That kind of enchantment and seduction was something that young girls could not possibly hope to imitate.

She was not only mature and voluptuous, she also had an intimidating heroic air to her, like a goddess of war. However, this suit of armor was really too well-fitted, completely outlining her shapely hips. That rounded angle was like a well-ripened peach, being extremely tempting.

And Xie Donglai followed behind her. Like a student who had made a mistake, his head was bowed and his waist bent.

“The Purple Moon Divine Maiden!” When they saw this woman, not one person dared to cast another look at her voluptuous figure. All of them half-knelt, appearing to be extremely anxious.

Only now did realization dawn on Ling Han. No wonder this woman was so forceful. As it turned out, she was the famous Purple Moon Divine Maiden, the chief general of the Purple Moon Army!

What a joke that Xie Donglai actually dared compete with her, and even dared to threaten her. He was truly an idiot to the extreme.

When he saw Ling Han, Xie Donglai’s face involuntarily flushed dark crimson.

Previously, he had boasted that he would obtain the Realm Spirit Stone, yet now, he had lost completely and utterly. Furthermore, he had even offended the Purple Moon Divine Maiden because of this, so he definitely had to seek the latter’s forgiveness. Otherwise, if this matter was known to the Xie Clan, then he would really be done for.

The clan would definitely not prioritize a clansman that had offended an elite of Eternal River Tier.

And of all things, this had all been witnessed by Ling Han!

How humiliating.
