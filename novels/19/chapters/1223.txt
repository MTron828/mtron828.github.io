Chapter 1224: Crawl out of This Street

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘Impossible!’

Liang Jinbo wore an expression of utter shock. As an alchemy prodigy and someone who was just qualified to be referred to as grandmaster, he could clearly see that the quality of the three pills had increased significantly.

‘Are you a bloody freak? You’re actually able to reform already refined pills and elevate their quality?

‘Just how powerful does your divine sense need to be? How deep is your understanding of medicinal ingredients?

‘This is unbelievable!

‘Can Level Five alchemists do this?’

Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang were also stunned by Ling Han’s feat. His accomplishment was far too freakish! Ling Han could definitely crush them! Moreover, Ling Han had been able to snatch the Four Directions Pills from Kang Xiu Yuan’s hand with ease. This said a lot about his cultivation level.

Such a young alchemy and cultivation prodigy was actually willing to join their Han Lin Pavilion?

They were dizzy with excitement.

“This?!” The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion all dashed over and surrounded Liang Jinbo. They carefully examined the Four Directions Pills in his hands. However, they could only reach one conclusion no matter how they examined the pills—the pills that had been modified by Ling Han were far higher in quality than the pills that had been refined by Liang Jinbo.

With such a huge difference in quality, even the members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion couldn’t bring themselves to deliberately twist the facts and argue about whose pills were better.

“How is it?” Ling Han asked with a smile. “Let’s continue the competition.”

The members of the Treasure Forest Pavilion all looked at each other. They had known that the most skilled alchemist in the Han Lin Pavilion was only a Level Five alchemist. Thus, there was naturally no Level Six alchemist in their group, let alone a Level Seven alchemist.

However, Ling Han had succeeded in elevating the quality of a Level Five Divine Pill, and this signified that his alchemy was definitely above Level Five.

Who here could compete against him?

“Heh, who would’ve thought there was a hidden prodigy in the small Han Lin Pavilion?” an elder of the Treasure Forest Pavilion said. His surname was Hu, and people all referred to him as Grandmaster Hu or Alchemist Hu. He was also the leader of the Treasure Forest Pavilion delegation.

He calmed his own camp, and also sent someone to report this matter. They had already won five matches in a row, and today was a good opportunity to take the Han Lin Pavilion down. How could they fall at the last hurdle?

“Sir, you are?” he asked.

“Ling Han,” Ling Han replied with a smile.

“Ling Han... Han Lin Pavilion?” Alchemist Hu murmured to himself. He found this a bit strange. Was this just a coincidence? He chuckled, and said, “Grandmaster Ling already has such outstanding alchemy achievements at such a young age. Your future is truly limitless! However, Grandmaster Ling looks a little unfamiliar. Perhaps you’ve only just joined the Han Lin Pavilion?”

They had naturally investigated their opponent before coming to challenge them. Thus, they knew the Han Lin Pavilion as well as the palm of their hands. However, the sudden appearance of Ling Han caught them completely off guard.

“Grandmaster Ling is a newly hired senior elder of my pavilion,” Yun Yong Wang immediately said. He naturally had to give Ling Han an authentic identity. Only then would his appearance seem convincing.

“Oh!” Alchemist Hu squinted his eyes as he nodded, and then said, “With Grandmaster Ling’s abilities, why choose to waste your talent on the measly Han Lin Pavilion? How about you join our Treasure Forest Pavilion? We’ll definitely provide you with more opportunities.”

F*ck! He was trying to steal their senior elder in public!

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “With me—the senior elder—present, the Han Lin Pavilion will definitely become the most powerful Holy Land for alchemists in the Great Crimson Sun Imperial Empire, Cloud Apex Planet, Long Light Galaxy, and even the entire Immortal Realm. So, how about you join the Han Lin Pavilion? I can give you some tips.”

‘Holy mother f*cker! How incredibly arrogant!’

To say nothing of the Treasure Forest Pavilion, even the members of the Han Lin Pavilion started to wipe cold sweat off their foreheads. They could barely maintain their footing in Big Trade City, yet Ling Han was actually dreaming of dominating the entire Immortal Realm? This... Was there any need to make such an audacious claim?

Meanwhile, Alchemist Hu grimaced upon hearing Ling Han’s words. He was already quite old, and he had studied alchemy for several million years. Even if he divided this time by 10, the number of years he had spent would still be far above what Ling Han had spent. Yet, Ling Han had actually offered to give him tips? How could he tolerate such belittling?

Although knowledge didn’t care about age, with those capable becoming the masters, Ling Han was still far too young. Moreover, he had only revealed a tiny bit of his skills. That wasn’t enough to convince everyone! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In the end, he could only say, “Grandmaster Ling has such amazing confidence!”

In any case, Ling Han’s performance had proved that he was at least a Level Six alchemist.

Alchemy was similar to cultivation in that those at a higher level were referred to as a senior. However, though there were prodigies who could fight above their tier in cultivation, this was impossible in alchemy. The level of an alchemist was determined by the highest level pill they could refine. Thus, there was no notion of competing above one’s tier.

Since Ling Han’s alchemy level was higher than his, Alchemist Hu had to maintain an attitude of respect. Otherwise, he would be frowned upon by fellow alchemists.

Meanwhile, Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan smiled happily. They both felt a sense of exaltation.

The Treasure Forest Pavilion had started targeting them for no reason, and they had been on the losing end the entire time. Only at this moment did they turn the tables in a brilliant fashion. How could they not be delighted? This kind of sensation was absolutely euphoric. It reminded them of their time in the small world, where they had traveled around with their master.

At that time, who didn’t beg them to refine pills?

“Hahahaha! Who would’ve thought that the Han Lin Pavilion still had an elite!” There was a long bout of laughter as a man of around 30 years old walked in. He was dressed in an elegant white robe, and he appeared extremely dashing and confident.

“It’s Grandmaster He!”

“He’s He Jingyun, and he’s referred to as the youngest Level Six alchemist! His future is limitless!”

“Heh, forget about that title. I know at least 10 people who are younger but more talented than Grandmaster He. However, Grandmaster He is indeed an alchemy prodigy. He became a Level Five alchemist 30,000 years ago, yet he was able to surge forward and become a Level Six alchemist 10,000 or so years ago!”

“That’s incredible!”

“By playing this trump card, it looks like the Treasure Forest Pavilion wants to crush the Han Lin Pavilion!”

“Of course! It’s already reached this stage, so they definitely have to press home their advantage.”

“But... why do I feel like the Treasure Forest Pavilion is going to lose?”

“Same! This young man seems extremely unpredictable. Perhaps he’ll perform a miracle!”

The onlookers were all engaged in spirited discussions, and there wasn’t overwhelming support for He Jingyun.

“Our respects to Grandmaster He!” The alchemists of the Treasure Forest Pavilion all bowed toward He Jingyun. In this world, power was might.

He Jingyun raised his hand slightly, and said, “Rise!” He then looked at Ling Han, and said, “Sir, you’ve only just joined the Han Lin Pavilion, so why embroil yourself in this mess?”

“Heh.” Ling Han replied with an indifferent chuckle. He naturally wouldn’t waste his time discussing such nonsense.

Anyhow, who would know that Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang were actually his disciples? Moreover, with his protective nature, how could he stand by idly while his disciples were bullied?

No way!

A menacing look appeared in He Jingyun’s eyes. He was indeed a prodigy—a supreme prodigy. Thus, he was extremely conceited, and incredibly prone to becoming jealous.

Now that a younger and possibly equally as talented alchemist had appeared, he was naturally filled with displeasure.

“I’ll compete against you,” he said. “However, the loser will have to crawl out of this street!”
