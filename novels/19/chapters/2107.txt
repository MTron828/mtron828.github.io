Chapter 2108: Astonishing Lead

“Who’s above you?” Ling Han asked again. His voice was extremely calm, yet it now carried a hint of killing intent.

He definitely wouldn’t show mercy, especially to cultivators of the other cultivation system. They were all parasites of the Celestial Realm.

Xiong Si wore a conflicted expression, yet his mouth remained tightly shut.

‘You’re not going to say, huh?’

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Then there’s no option but to rape his ass.”

Xiong Si was terrified upon hearing this. Of the pains that he couldn’t endure, getting a*s-raped was definitely one of them.

However, upon recalling the punishment for betrayal, his entire body shivered in fright. His mouth remained shut.

“Let Niu deal with him!” Hu Niu immediately charged over to pummel Xiong Si, transforming him into a pig head. However, even though he wailed in pain like a sissy, he still didn’t speak.

“It’s useless!” Xiong Si said in a feeble voice. “There’s a restriction in my divine sense, and as long as I mention anything that I shouldn’t, this restriction will instantly obliterate my divine sense.”

‘Is that the case?’

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t believe him so easily. He placed a hand on Xiong Si’s forehead, entering with his own divine sense.

Weng!?His divine sense took form, becoming identical to his physical self. However, it was several times smaller. It then barged into Xiong Si’s divine sense.

‘Strange!’

He immediately discovered that Xiong Si’s divine sense was indeed enveloped by restrictions. Wisps of black aura hovered in the surroundings, radiating with a sinister intent that was completely incompatible with this heaven and earth. A feeling of disgust involuntarily arose in Ling Han’s mind.

Upon closer inspection, Ling Han discovered that it wasn’t himself that was rejecting this aura, but rather the Regulations that he practiced.

If one didn’t practice the Regulations of this world, they would be repelled by this world. They would be enemies.

This black aura was extremely powerful. Even though there were only wisps of it, they possessed the ability to destroy Ling Han’s divine sense. Thus, he didn’t dare to rashly target it.

However, would he let Xiong Si off the hook because of this?

He had finally come across a living enemy, so he would definitely squeeze some information out of him no matter what.

‘Can Source Powers of heaven and earth resist this?’

With this in mind, Ling Han immediately activated all four of his Source Powers, sending them into Xiong Si’s body.

“Aaah!” Xiong Si immediately wailed in agony. Four columns of brilliant light burst from his body and soared into the sky. It was as if these columns of light connected heaven and earth.

After being subject to the power of four Source Powers, Xiong Si would be crippled even if he didn’t die. However, Ling Han naturally wasn’t worried about this. It would be fine as long as Xiong Si didn’t go crazy or die before Ling Han got any useful information.

With the protection of four Source Powers. Ling Han started to assault Xiong Si’s divine sense.

The wisps of black aura immediately started to counterattack, transforming into sabers, swords, axes, and much more. These weapons furiously hacked at Ling Han. Meanwhile, Ling Han controlled his four Source Powers to block these attacks.

In battles of the divine sense, what was more important was one’s cultivation level. Meanwhile, the four Source Powers were all at the Celestial King Tier. If they weren’t restricted by Ling Han’s cultivation level, their power would far surpass that of Ling Han.

Boom!?Four-colored light flashed around Ling Han’s divine sense, and he was much like a colorful battle god at this moment. He was filled with vigor as he courageously marched forward.

Even though he continued to charge forward, he still couldn’t help but feel astonished in his mind. This was because his four Source Powers could only destroy the obstructions before him if they worked together. The person who had created this restriction was definitely extremely powerful.

When Ling Han was about to reach Xiong Si’s divine sense, the wisps of black aura seemingly realized that they couldn’t block him anymore. They suddenly stopped attacking him, and they instead turned around to slash down at Xiong Si’s divine sense.

‘Not good!’ Ling Han shouted in his mind. However, how could he stop this?

Boom!

Xiong Si’s divine sense was instantly pulverized. He couldn’t withstand this power at all.

‘Damn it!’

Ling Han had no option but to reach over and fish for fragments of Xiong Si’s memory. With the help of his four Source Powers. he finally managed to obtain some fragments of memory.

“Ancient battlefield… Extracting Source Power… Black Dragon King…” Lin Han murmured.

He had only obtained a pitiful amount of fragments of Xiong Si’s memory. However, he had still discovered a few key terms. The most shocking piece of information was naturally the plan to extract Source Powers.

Source Powers were born from the will of heaven and earth, and they more so represented the great dao of heaven and earth. If they were destroyed, that would be a huge blow to heaven and earth.

This was analogous to killing someone’s son. Just how aggrieved would their parents be?

Moreover, this sinister group had a history of doing such things.

They had stayed at Ascent Route Island for millions of years, and this was for no other reason than to obtain the Firm Essence Green Gold.

If it weren’t for Ling Han coincidentally encountering a tsunami, and if it weren’t for Xiao Gu coincidentally arriving at the right time, the results would have been difficult to predict.

However, had that tsunami truly been a coincidence?

Suspicion suddenly arose in Ling Han’s mind. Heaven and earth possessed a soul, and the existence of heavenly tribulation was proof of this. However, heaven and earth could only operate under some kind of rules, and they couldn’t overly interfere with the world. Otherwise, if everyone was dealt a Celestial King Tier tribulation, who could survive?

Anyhow, was the sudden tsunami that had sent him onto the island a self-saving act of heaven and earth?

Ling Han suddenly felt pity for heaven and earth. They clearly possessed the ultimate power of the world, yet they even seemed inferior to measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivators at times.

Whoosh!

His divine sense retreated from Xiong Si’s divine sense. Looking down, he saw that Xiong Si was already dead.

He had no physical wounds, and it was as if he were merely asleep. However, his divine sense had already been pulverized, so he was naturally as dead as could be.

“How was it?” the Empress asked in a solemn voice. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “I discovered some things. However, these things far exceed our capability.”

“What is it?” someone asked. A figure silently appeared next to them. This was none other than Lu Hairong.

She truly came and went like a shadow.

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and he believed that this wasn’t something they could resolve. They needed to seek help from Celestial Kings.

In the Celestial Realm, those who had the word “king” in their title were normally all Celestial Kings. Otherwise, they would be pummeled to death in a few days.

The fragments of Xiong Si’s memory were most likely saying that there was a Source Power of heaven and earth in the ancient battlefield. Moreover, the sinister force was currently extracting this Source Power, and the elite in charge was the Black Dragon Celestial King.

There had also been a Source Power of heaven and earth on Ascent Route Island, but the person in charge had only been an Ascending Origin Tier elite. In other words, they had been a ninth lotus elite. Now, however, the ancient battlefield was actually being guarded by a Celestial King. The gulf in power was truly huge.

There were only three minor levels in the Ascending Origin Tier, yet there were nine heavens in the Celestial King Tier. Ascending each level would be as difficult as ascending the heavens, and the gulf between each level was incredibly large. Thus, even Lu Hairong might not be able to deal with them.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before asking, “Senior, do you know about the existence of the other cultivation system? The one that uses first lotus, second lotus, and so on to differentiate their cultivation levels?”

“Hmm?” A look of astonishment spread across Lu Hairong’s face. ‘What nonsense is this brat spouting? Under the restrictions of the Regulations, cultivators can only abide by the rules of heaven and earth. How could there be another cultivation system?’

Ling Han was also slightly astonished. Lu Hairong actually wasn’t aware of the existence of the other cultivation system?

Even a Fourth Heaven Celestial King hadn’t heard about this before?

“Aiyah, stop speaking nonsense with her!” Hu Niu placed her hands on her hips, and said, “Ugly hag, Niu orders you to immediately bring elites over. Niu is going to fight someone!”

Lu Hairong smiled bitterly as she shook her head. The Roc Palace was being brutally suppressed by the Four Seas Palace at the moment, so much so that even their existence was under threat. How could she bring any elites over? Even her presence here was a stretch. Removing a Fourth Heaven Celestial King from the battle was already putting much stress on the Roc Palace’s defenses.

It wasn’t that the Roc Palace was weak, but rather that the Four Seas Palace was far too powerful!

“In other words, it’s up to the few of us to deal with this?” Ling Han murmured.

“There’s also Xiao Gu,” the Empress said in reminder.

Ling Han nodded in agreement. Even though Xiao Gu was unreliable, his strength was indeed incredible. His ordinary battle prowess could rival those at the Ascending Origin Tier. If he unleashed the power of his Celestial King Bone, he could even rival those at the Celestial King Tier.

“Then let’s wait for Xiao Gu to return before making any plans.”
