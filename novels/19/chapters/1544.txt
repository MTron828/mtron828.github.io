Chapter 1545 Treasure exchange

“Brother, come. Brother Li will bring you to show off and fly.” Gou Li seemed like he did not take the previous incident to heart, and appeared very simple-minded.

“Hoho, you’re planning to screw me over again?” Ling Han asked calmly as he drew out a roast chicken and began to eat.

As Gou Li watched, he couldn’t help but drool.

He had finished eating his two roast chickens, and looking at Ling Han feasting now, with his nose smelling that alluring aroma, he couldn’t help but become restless, and finally said, “Brother, give me a chicken leg.”

Ling Han laughed loudly. He believed that a glutton could not possibly be a bad guy, but not being a bad guy definitely did not mean he was a “good guy”. He shook his head, and retorted, “If you want to eat, go and steal it yourself.”

“What a joke; is Brother Li the kind of person who would do that?” Gou Li exclaimed righteously, but then his face became a grimace. “Only two chickens, a cock and hen, is left behind and they can lay eggs. I can’t just give up the future delicacies to satisfy a momentary greed, right?”

Ling Han was astounded. “I didn’t think that you are the kind of person to take the big picture into consideration[1]?”

He deliberately emphasized the word ‘picture’, and Gou Li immediately understood what he was insinuating. He couldn’t help but leap up. “Brat, you are so filthy!”

“I am not as shameless as you!”

“King of filth!”

“Chicken thief!”

The two of them each gave the other a nickname, and then both of them broke into laughter.

“It’s about time. Let’s go,” Gou Li suddenly said.

“Go where?” Ling Han asked.

“Yi, aren’t you here to participate in the treasure exchange?” Gou Li was surprised.

“Oh, treasure exchange?” Ling Han felt an involuntary cheer. He still lacked a few Level 13 Godly metals. As long as the Divine Demon Sword reached Level 14, he would be able to improve it by three levels in one go, and rush up to the height of Level 17.

Saint Tool!

“Let’s go, go, go, where is it?”

Gou Li scratched his head. “I thought you were here for this, yet you don’t even know where the treasure exchange is held? Hey, it can’t be that you also don’t know that there are two mighty figures agreeing to battle this time, right?”

“I really don’t know. What kind of mighty figures?” Ling Han asked without the slightest shame.

“I am really defeated by you.” Gou Li shook his head repeatedly. “I’ll explain on the way.”

The two of them set out, with Gou Li leading the way. Under the feet of two Eternal River Tiers, the great mountains and rivers were quickly passed as if they were simply outlines. They were progressing at an astonishingly rapid pace.

As it turned out, this planet was called Cold Clouds Planet, and belonged to the Aurora Galaxy. The Aurora Galaxy was a super-large galaxy, and very coincidentally, two Demon Masters were actually born at the same time here—they were equivalent to the Saints of the Immortal Realm.

As the saying goes, ‘two tigers cannot share one mountain’. Though the two Demon Masters did not have a life and death feud with each other, they had always wanted to confirm who was stronger between the two of them. Thus, every 100,000 years, they would conduct a spar.

A battle on the level of Demon Masters, how astonishing was this? Could everyone witness such an event at another time?

Thus, this also became a distinguished gathering of the Aurora Galaxy. Every time the agreed battle was conducted, it would attract a great number of people coming to watch. Of course, Demon Masters would naturally be fighting in the skies. Otherwise, when they finished their battle, it would also mean that the whole galaxy could rest in peace too.

Because there were too many people coming, everyone would trade the treasures that they themselves could not use. As time passed, this gradually became a distinguished gathering too.

Now, there was a group of young king tiers gathering in the Black Jade Mountains to participate in a treasure exchange.

Ling Han nodded internally. Since they were king tiers, it should be no problem for them to produce some Level 13 Godly metal.

Slightly less than half a day passed, and they arrived at the foot of a mountain. This was a completely black mountain peak, and was covered with black vines. The leaves had a jade-like luster, but because there were too many of them, the mountain peak looked like a piece of black jade.

“Filth King, follow your Brother Li. These people have many rules, and if you are not strong enough, you won’t be allowed to climb up at all,” Gou Li said.

Ling Han merely smiled, and did not say anything.

Because of the Regulations, he looked to only be in the middle stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and his normal battle prowess was also in the early stage of the medium extreme. Though he had “surpassed” three stars, this was not enough in the face of king tiers.

There were many people gathered at the foot of the mountain. The majority of them were seated in a cross-legged position, and a small number were issuing challenges in the surrounding area, appearing very warlike.

Seeing that Ling Han and Gou Li were planning to ascend the mountain, a person immediately stepped out to stop them. “Want to ascend? Do you have the kind of strength that qualifies you for that?”

Gou Li waved his fist. “You can come and try it out.”

“All right!” The person immediately rushed forwards, drew his saber, and slashed out.

Peng!

Gou Li’s fist shot out, the force of his fist becoming a wild beast, and sent the person flying abruptly. With a cold flash, the saber in the person’s grip was also sent flying out of his hand.

After this attack, the people around them suddenly became well-behaved.

“Let’s go,” Gou Li said uncaringly.

Ling Han did not take it to heart, either. If he exploded with his maximum battle prowess, then only those who had cultivated the pinnacle level in the Eternal River Tier could be a match for him. He naturally would not take a minor character that could be defeated in a single move like this to heart.

The two of them walked on the mountain path, but they had only walked 30-odd meters when they saw a person seated on a large boulder. His right hand was holding a sword scabbard, his expression icy cold.

Ling Han was certain that this man was stronger than the people at the foot of the mountain.

Interesting. These people knew to find their positions based on their abilities?

Gou Li did not say a word, and immediately rushed up and began fighting.

That man was very strong, delivering a slash that stunned the skies, but compared to Gou Li, he was still considerably inferior. Very soon, he was defeated, and stepped out of their way.

Only then did Ling Han know that this was a very common happening in the Netherworld. When there was any kind of distinguished gathering, only those top-grade individuals could participate. Those who were defeated would be distributed in the surroundings according to their abilities. If there was a newcomer, they would have to fight their way up.

No wonder no one directly flew to the summit.

In the Netherworld, this was a rule that was common knowledge.

Ling Han nodded internally. Thankfully, he had not spoken out, or others would definitely suspect that he was a country bumpkin that had popped out from some unknown corner. He didn’t even know that kind of common knowledge.

Every 30-plus meters, there would be a person standing guard, and their abilities were getting stronger and stronger. Yet, Gou Li would be stronger the stronger his opponent was. He managed to deal with all his opponents within 10 moves, and appeared to have unfathomable depths.

Ling Han involuntarily laughed, “What is it? Are you afraid that I would know too much about you?”

Gou Li took a few looks at him, and then said, “I don’t know why, but my instincts tell me that you are not as weak as you look.”

“In truth, I have killed a Saint from the Immortal Realm before,” Ling Han said with absolute seriousness.

Pu!

Gou Li suddenly spluttered out in laughter. Clapping a hand on Ling Han’s shoulder, he held his middle in bouts of laughter, and looked like he was almost going to tear up from laughing so much. “Not only do you have filthy thoughts, you are also quite funny!”

“I really have killed a Saint before,” Ling Han emphasized.

“En, en, en!” Gou Li nodded quickly, but judging by his mad laughter, it was obvious that he thought that Ling Han was telling a cold joke.

Ling Han sighed. Why did no one believe him when he was seriously telling the truth?

The two of them continued their climb up the mountain. Gou Li was indeed very awesome, sweeping aside all opposition they encountered. Finally, they arrived at the top of the mountain. There was a large platform here, and in the center, there were 10 stone chairs, but there were only nine people seated now. In the surroundings, there were still a great many people standing, as if they were surrounding and protecting those nine people.

Obviously, these people here had managed to fight their way up here, and were qualified to participate in the treasure exchange, but only those nine king tiers were qualified to sit high above the rest.

“Brother Li, go on!” Ling Han suddenly said loudly. “Defeat all of them; it is time for you to show your might!”

Gou Li’s face suddenly turned green.

‘You can’t f****** screw me over like this!’

[1] MC says 大菊观, but is referring to ‘the big picture’, but 菊 also means ‘anus’, so this is a gay-ish insult to Gou Li.
