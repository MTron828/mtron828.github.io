2915 Overbearing Attitude

Actually, while the reasoning behind Xin Qihu’s words was quite twisted, it did have some logic.

If Hysteria’s army was allowed to once again form a super-large-scale army, then such an army would be able to explode with terrifying destructive power under the command of the intelligent monsters. This fact had already been proven.

So if Ling Han was capable, then Ling Han should be the one to go.

“Well said!” Brother Nalan immediately said loudly. “Ling Han, everyone is making sacrifices for the sake of the world. We can make sacrifices, so why can’t you?”

He hated Ling Han to the core, and when he saw that Ling Han had come back alive, he was naturally incredibly surprised. One might have been fortunate enough to come back alive once, but would one be able to come back alive a second time, or a third time?

Ling Han couldn’t help but chuckle. Xin Qihu’s shamelessness in such a self-righteous manner made him totally speechless, and this Brother Nalan was disgusting indeed.

“Ling Han, for the sake of the greater picture, we’ll have to trouble you to bear the burden for a bit,” Xin Qihu said. Then, he looked at the other people. “Everyone, what do you all think?”

Without waiting for anyone to express their stand, he continued, “If Hysteria’s army launches another attack, it can be imagined how terrifying the consequences will be. Perhaps our city defense will be breached, and perhaps there will be a considerable number of people here who will disappear forever.”

When these words were spoken, everyone fell silent; even those who had wanted to speak remained silent.

The scene described by Xin Qihu had a great possibility of becoming a reality.

Who would want to die?

Not even a single person. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, since someone had to be sacrificed, it would be fine as long as it wasn’t going to be themselves. Moreover, the various forces had been fighting with each other previously, and had long since lost their unity. It was their own interests that mattered most.

Therefore, some people even nodded their heads in agreement with Xin Qihu’s statement.

“That’s right. Those who are capable should do more. Since Ling Han can escape once, I believe he can also escape a second time, or a third time.”

“Those intelligent monsters are too terrifying, they must be killed.”

“Ling Han, for the sake of the greater picture, and for the sake of the world, you’ll have to compromise!”

The words that these people uttered, using great principles to suppress Ling Han.

F***, did they really think that he was an easy target to bully?

Ling Han’s gaze turned sinister. In fact, Xin Qihu didn’t need to force him, as Ling Han wasn’t the kind of person who would give up halfway, and he had already made up his mind to reenter Hysteria’s camp and kill more boss monsters.

After all, it was everyone’s responsibility to defend the Flaming Frost Realm, and Ling Han was duty-bound to do so.

However, being forced into it was a completely different matter.

Ling Han was displeased, extremely displeased.

“Since everyone thinks that Ling Han is the best candidate to complete this mission, then it’s decided.” Xin Qihu looked at Ling Han smilingly. “This was decided by everyone!”

Lin Youlian couldn’t help but frown. Xin Qihu was really impressive. It was clearly an unreasonable matter, yet he actually made it seem as if it was right and appropriate, making her not know what else to say.

Was this matter fair to Ling Han?

Of course it wasn’t fair.

However, with Hysteria’s invasion, was it a matter that would be considered as fair to anyone concerned?

Ling Han had returned. Had he been covered with injuries, she could have used the excuse that Ling Han needed to recuperate from his injuries and suppress this matter. However, Ling Han was completely unwounded, and appeared to be very much at ease. Then, for the sake of the Genesis World, for the sake of all life in the world, who would go if not him?

Ling Han looked at Xin Qihu. “Sick cat, I didn’t expect you to be so shameless1.”

“Watch your words. Otherwise, I won’t mind teaching you a lesson,” Xin Qihu said calmly. His eyes burned, exuding a sinister killing intent.

Ling Han chuckled. He would beat this guy into a sick cat one day.

Anyway, he was free to come and go anywhere. Xin Qihu thought that he had created a huge obstacle and pushed Ling Han into the fire pit, but in fact Ling Han didn’t care.

However, being publicly oppressed by Xin Qihu, Ling Han was naturally extremely displeased. He really wanted to pin him down and beat the crap out of him.

This caused him to feel suffocated. Wasn’t the reason why Xin Qihu dared to be so arrogant because he possessed the battle prowess of a Sixth Tier?

Ling Han definitely had to improve his cultivation level and abilities as soon as possible, and beat up this sick cat.

With a flourish of his sleeves, Ling Han turned around and left, appearing very furious.

Of course, this was for people to see. One couldn’t be happy in such a situation, right? Besides, he was indeed extremely upset.

When he returned, the Empress and the others came out of the Celestial Guest Residence. Upon hearing about this matter, they were also extremely displeased. If it was not for the fact that the gap in strength was too wide, they would really want to crush Xin Qihu into dust.

“This damn bastard, Niu curses him to fall into the cesspit and drown!” Hu Niu snorted.

“Sores to grow on his head.”

“Pus to ooze out from the soles of his feet.”

Liu Yutong, Li Sichan, and other women made similar statements.

Ling Han laughed. As long as he was with these women, he would feel happy and be at ease from the bottom of his heart.

“Is Brother Ling there?” A voice came from outside.

“Who is it?” All the women were surprised.

When they went out, they saw a young man standing at the door with a gentle smile on his face, making people feel comfortable just looking at him.

This was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, but the feeling that Ling Han got from him was that he was extremely powerful. It was extremely likely that his battle prowess wasn’t any weaker than his own.

It was quite astonishing; the gap between Fourth Tier and Fifth Tier was as wide as the distance between heaven and earth. Being at Fourth Tier, and yet having the battle prowess of Fifth Tier; in fact, there were only Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and the other supreme prodigies that counted in that category.

That was why Ling Han was stunned. How could a supreme prodigy appear so casually?

“How should I address you, sir?” Ling Han asked with a smile. He didn’t know why the other party had come, so he naturally used civilities before resorting to force.

The young man revealed an awkward expression. “My surname is Bai.”

Ling Han looked at him in disbelief. He was done just by saying that his surname was Bai?

The youngster surnamed Bai hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Bai Mifan.”

...

Pu!

Ling Han and the others spluttered in laughter. No wonder this person was so hesitant. As it turned out, he had such a weird name2.

“Are you always hungry?” Hu Niu asked. Otherwise, how could he be given such a name? “How pitiful.”

Bai Mifan smiled, and said, “This name was given to me by my grandfather. This is something that the old man has decided, so what can I do about it?” He cupped his hands in obeisance, appearing very helpless.

“Your grandfather is really… interesting.” Ling Han thought of a word.

“I can also be considered as having encountered an ill fate,” Bai Mifan said leisurely.

“What has brought Brother Bai here?” Ling Han asked.

“I want to participate in Brother Ling’s decapitation operation,” Bai Mifan said.

‘Ya!’

Ling Han was taken aback; besides Fu Yuan, there was actually another such “fool”?

“Brother Bai, don’t you know that it’s very dangerous?” he asked.

...

“What meaning is there to it if it’s not dangerous?” Bai Mifan said with a smile. Though his expression was gentle, he had an indescribable confidence. That was a pride that came from deep within his bones.

“It’s a good thing that you’re brave, but what about Brother Bai’s strength?” Ling Han said with a serious expression.

“Brother Ling, let’s have a spar.” Bai Mifan smiled.

“All right, come!”

The two of them soared into the air, and Bai Mifan immediately launched an attack. His palm pressed down upon Ling Han. Hong, a terrifying aura spread out. As expected, he had Fifth-Tier battle prowess.
