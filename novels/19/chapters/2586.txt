Chapter 2587: Fool

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Tang Mingbo naturally didn’t believe that Ling Han would obediently hand himself over. Thus, he had continued to use his divine sense to scan the surrounding area, determining whether anyone remained hiding in the houses or inside a Spatial God Tool.

Just then, he had discovered an extremely faint fluctuation.

This was the fluctuation of a Spatial God Tool. With his cultivation as a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, he could already enjoy an equal status with the Great Dao, so just how sensitive was his divine sense?

He immediately determined that there was a living being inside this Spatial God Tool.

Thus, he resolutely concluded that Ling Han was hiding inside.

He immediately attacked without any reservations.

Peng!

Just as his large hand was about to grab the house, there was a deafening rumble as the house self-destructed first. A large black hand reached out, blocking Tang Mingbo’s hand.

The owner of this hand was definitely extremely powerful, with his strike directly shattering Tang Mingbo’s large hand.

“Hmm?”

“Huh?”

Lu Gaoquan and the others had all been absent-minded just then, yet at this moment, they all wore surprised expressions. In fact, they were slightly astounded.

The ability to block Tang Mingbo’s strike proved that this person was definitely no weaker than him.

This definitely wasn’t Ling Han!

“Friend, who are you? Why are you hiding?” Lu Gaoquan shouted.

“Heh, do you people insist on forcing me out?” an old voice replied. An elder with a hunched back slowly trod upon space as he walked into the air.

This person was truly very old, with his back so hunched that he looked like a shrimp. There was a cane in his hand, and all of his hair had already become white. There was no ribbon of iridescent light around him, and it was clear that he had purposefully suppressed his aura.

However, upon seeing this elder, Lu Gaoquan and the others all inhaled a sharp breath, wearing expressions of utter shock.

“Zhan Feiyu!” they exclaimed in unison.

Zhan Feiyu was an old-generation Celestial King who had already reached the Ninth Heaven long ago. Moreover, he wasn’t a resident of Ghost King City, and he was instead the most powerful subordinate of Prosperous Opening City’s city lord. His status was equivalent to that of Ghost King City’s Yang Que.

More importantly, Prosperous Opening City was at odds with Ghost King City, with both sides yearning to defeat and conquer the other.

In the Celestial King Graveyard, even though human life was worthless, it was also the most valuable resource at the same time.

Right now, a pillar of the opposing force had secretly hidden inside Ghost King City? What were they planning to do?

Hang on… Why had Ling Han fled here?

Oh, indeed!

Ling Han was definitely a member of Prosperous Opening City! He had been sent here, though it was unclear what his exact aim was. In any case, he had caused a huge commotion, so he had fled here to seek help from Zhan Feiyu.

Heh, what an utter fool! He had exposed Zhan Feiyu just like that! Otherwise, it was truly hard to say when they would have discovered Zhan Feiyu’s existence. At that time, perhaps he would have already succeeded in his plan and caused catastrophic damage.

After all, he was the second-most influential person in Prosperous Opening City, so could his scheme be small?

This being the case, they truly needed to thank Ling Han. They needed to thank this utter fool.

They were sure that Ling Han was definitely hiding in Zhan Feiyu’s Spatial God Tool at this moment. Thus, as long as they could capture Zhan Feiyu, they could also capture Ling Han.

Meanwhile, Ling Han also wore an expression of shock as he stood among the crowd of people.

He had chosen a random direction to flee in, yet he had actually dragged another Ninth Heaven Celestial King into this mess? Moreover, this person seemed extremely freakish.

Sure enough, Ling Han was a big troublemaker. He could drag people into trouble no matter where he went. His ability was as powerful as could be.

He secretly stepped back in retreat. Even if he stayed to watch the show, he would need to watch from a safe distance. After all, a battle between Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be far too terrifying. Even the shock waves from their battle would be devastating and fatal.

Right now, Zhan Feiyu was definitely the most frustrated person. In fact, he had already hidden here for several years, not coming across a single hitch. So, what in the world had gone wrong? Why had he been exposed?

Moreover, judging from Lu Gaoquan and the other’s expressions, they seemingly hadn’t known about this, either. They had only found him by accident.

He had truly suffered great misfortune.

Which bastard had dragged him into their mess? His meticulous plan was now at risk of evaporating into smoke! This infuriated him greatly. If he found out who the culprit was, he would definitely hack them to death.

No, hacking them to death wouldn’t be enough. He would severely wound them, and then heal them to full health. He would then repeat this again and again several hundred times before killing them.

Zhan Feiyu suppressed his frustration and anger before saying, “Since I’ve been exposed, I’ll take my leave now! I’ll also give you all a warning. Following Azure Ghost will only lead to a bad fate. It’s better for you to surrender to Prosperous Opening City, where we can take part in a magnificent cause together.”

He decided to leave, yet he still didn’t forget to sling some mud at the Azure Ghost Celestial King. Even if this was futile, he could still mess with their minds a little.

“Zhan Feiyu, can you escape?” Tang Mingbo said in a baleful voice. The culprit who had killed his son was hiding inside this person’s Spatial God Tool! Moreover, he involuntarily thought of many more things at this moment. Perhaps it had all been a scheme of Prosperous Opening City? Perhaps they had purposefully targeted his son?

He had to avenge his son!

Zhan Feiyu truly wanted to curse. Tang Mingbo’s glare was far too piercing and ferocious! It was as if he had killed his father or son! What in the f*ck was this?! Even if he were expressing loyalty toward Azure Ghost, there was no need for his act to be so serious, right?

He humphed, and said, “If Azure Ghost doesn’t come out, who can stop me?”

He was a monarch tier, so he was much more powerful than ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. In reality, Lu Gaoquan, Tang Mingbo, and the others were all emperor tiers. If it weren’t for the environment of the Celestial King Graveyard, perhaps they might have been stuck at the First Heaven for their entire lives.

Of course, in the Celestial Realm, it was essentially impossible for emperor tiers to advance to the Celestial King Tier. However, this was a transcendent dimension, so there were also infinite possibilities.

“What about me?” a voice suddenly said in a calm manner. Another Ninth Heaven Celestial King suddenly appeared.

“Yang Que!” Zhan Feiyu exclaimed, his pupils immediately contracting. He looked toward this Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Yang Que was the second-most powerful person in Ghost King City. He had the appearance of a handsome and carefree young man in his twenties, and there were also semispheres on the back of his two hands. If they were combined, they would form the yin and yang symbol.

Zhan Feiyu wore a solemn expression. Yang Que was no weaker than him, so if they engaged in battle, it would be extremely difficult to determine a victor. Moreover, there were several other Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings present. Even though they were all weaker than him, their combined battle prowess naturally couldn’t be ignored.

If they ganged up on him, he would be in huge trouble.

However, the most terrifying person was naturally the Azure Ghost Celestial King. If Zhan Feiyu were trapped, and the Azure Ghost Celestial King came over, the former would truly face certain death.

“Brother Zhan, since you’ve come to Ghost King City, why didn’t you give me a heads up? I was unable to fulfill my duty as a host. Why don’t you stay for some tea? We can discuss cultivation over tea. That sounds like a fairly good plan, no?” Yang Que said. His voice was calm and composed.

Zhan Feiyu chuckled, and said, “I’m an extremely busy person. How about Brother Yang coming over to Prosperous Opening City next time?”

He didn’t hesitate a single bit as he turned around to leave. He didn’t give the Celestial Kings a chance to surround him.

Yang Que was the first to move as he stepped forward, as quick as lightning.

After reaching the Ninth Heaven, perhaps not even one in 100,000,000 people would advance to become a Heavenly Venerate. Thus, they all had sufficient time to cultivate more Regulations.

Moreover, the Regulations of Time and the Regulations of Space were naturally the two most likely Regulations for them to cultivate. Thus, the speed of most Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was fairly similar. As long as their aptitude was similar, their grasp of the Regulations of Time and Regulations of Space would also be fairly similar.

This was unless it were a newly advanced Ninth Heaven Celestial King who hadn’t had the time to cultivate these Regulations yet.

Thus, it was extremely difficult for Celestial Kings to pursue fellow Celestial Kings. This was especially the case for Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Without an advantage in cultivation, and without an advantage in Regulations, how could they possibly catch up?
