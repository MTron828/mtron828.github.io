Chapter 2574: Unjust

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s expression was dark, with him practically exploding with fury.

He did not mind that the opponent was strong, but what he could not accept was injustice.

If Niu Da had stopped him on the streets, and wanted to avenge the death of his brother, he would have gladly accepted the battle challenge.

But in this place, the other was clearly being a bully. This made Ling Han furious.

He wrapped Regulations around his fists, and met the approaching silver ring. Did Niu Da really think that Ling Han did not dare to confront it head-on?

Boom!

His fists slammed onto the silver ring, instantly causing waves to surge out in all directions.

Teng, teng, teng.?Both Ling Han and Niu Da took a few steps back.

Da, da, da.?Blood continuously dripped from his fists, yet Ling Han did not even glance at his wounds. His physique had reached the height of Sixth Heaven, so even if he wrapped Regulations around his fists, it was very hard to attain the level of Seventh Heaven.

Thus, in the direct clash with the silver ring, his skin was broken and flesh was exposed, blood dripping.

Niu Da was stunned. Could it be that this human was a relative of his? How could his physique possibly be so tough? It should be known that Niu Da was a member of the Herculean Iron Bull Race. His skin was as tough as steel, and he possessed shocking defenses.

Thankfully, being blasted by the Ring of Fiends, Ling Han was still outmatched and sustained injury.

Niu Da only had to keep up the high pressure, and he was completely capable of breaking every single bone in Ling Han’s body.

“Ga, ga,?ga1, again!” Niu Da rushed forth once more. He brandished the silver ring, forming one wave of attack after another, and blasting even the air itself as he continued to rush towards Ling Han.

Weng, weng, weng.?The blast reached Ling Han, and caused even his skin to ripple. It looked like a breeze had blown over a water surface, causing waves.

And Niu Da himself also surged over, waving the silver ring around, and smashing it towards Ling Han.

“Humph, are you in such a rush to be fried or steamed?” Ling Han retorted coldly. He unleashed his own Dao, throwing both fists in a series of punches as he clashed with Niu Da.

Though his fists kept sustaining injuries, the Indestructible Celestial King Physique possessed extremely strong recovery ability, and the Indestructible True Fluid had turned into a gaseous form that covered the insides of his body entirely. There was no need for him to actively use it at all.

Hence, even though he continued to suffer injuries, the speed of his recovery was not low, either, allowing him to continuously keep himself in prime condition.

Niu Da was shocked. Why was this human so hard to kill?

He finally understood that merely using this one weapon was completely inadequate to kill Ling Han. It was no wonder that his brother had died at the latter’s hand. True enough, this human was extremely freakish.

“You are worthy of more strength from me!” Niu Da laughed madly. His horn glowed, and a strong power instantly surged from his body, causing the space all around him to collapse. Strange deflections happened to the light in the area.

For their race, all their power was concentrated in their horn.

“Hahahaha, just watch as I crush you!” He charged out again, brandishing the silver ring wildly. When power had reached such heights as his had, there was no need to use any kind of technique at all. He only had to use brute force to crush his opponent.

Ling Han was unmoved. Stretching out his hands, he grabbed a streak of great dao and smashed it towards Niu Da.

The two exchanged blows, and Niu Da was still enjoying the upper hand in this battle.

He possessed greater battle prowess in the first place, and now that he used the natural talent of his race, he naturally became even stronger, causing Ling Han to retreat continuously from his powerful offensive. Ling Han’s skin was also continuously splitting apart, blood spraying in all directions.

The spectators screamed and howled at this scene. Every single person was shrieking.

They were indeed stunned at how the tournament had not adhered to their own rules, but once the battle had begun, they no longer cared.

Sympathy for Ling Han?

Who cared!

They only wanted to see a bloody slaughter, and as for whether it was just or unjust, what did that have to do with them?

“Kill him!”

“Smash him alive!”

“Skin him, and dig out his heart!”

Some of their preferences were extremely hardcore. Not only did they want Niu Da to kill Ling Han, the methods varied greatly as well. They were extremely cruel.

Niu Da laughed loudly. “Have you heard everyone’s cheers? Human, stop this useless resistance, and surrender your life obediently!”

Ling Han swept an eye on the spectators’ seats. Though he had long since known that the people here were all psychos, how these people were acting now still caused him a slight shock. He did not answer, and merely took out a red cloth, which he waved around at Niu Da.

‘F***, do you take me for an ordinary bull?’

Niu Da couldn’t help but explode with fury. He had long since gained intelligence. In fact, he was even more intelligent than the majority of humans. ‘You actually take out a red cloth; are you planning to have a bullfight?’

Just what great mockery was this?

“You are seeking death!” Niu Da poured his power into the silver ring.?Weng, this silver ring exploded with astonishing brilliance. It was as if it had turned into a sun. He suddenly puffed up his cheeks, and blew a gust of wind towards Ling Han. Instantly, a wide area of flames was spat out, blazing towards Ling Han.

Ling Han faced this calmly. His enemy was powerful, and looked like he could overwhelm him at that. But the more he was in such a situation, the calmer and more composed he would be. Unleashing his own Dao, he defended himself perfectly.

He was still sustaining injuries, but the fact that he could perform like this still stunned every single person.

It should be known that he was only a Third Heaven Celestial King, and there was a whole difference of two major tiers between himself and Niu Da. Furthermore, Niu Da was a Monarch Star. Logically, this should be a gap that could not be compensated for, yet now the two of them had already exchanged over 1,000 moves, and Ling Han was merely covered all over in blood. He had not lost any limbs, and his battle prowess was still flaring. This was practically a miracle.

On the spectators’ seats, Tang Yuan and the others were all secretly cheering Ling Han on. At present, they were now suppressed by Lu Li, and if Ling Han could survive this, it’d be as if they defeated Lu Li in a clash of another sort.

Meanwhile, Lu Li was slightly stunned, and he couldn’t help but turn to look towards A’Yuan. The strength of Ling Han’s battle prowess made him think of A’Yuan. This was also a freak that could defeat his enemies even with a difference of cultivation level between them.

In fact… was A’Yuan as strong as Ling Han?

He did not know, and did not have any answer at all.

However, it was fine. This was a battle to the death. Even if it took over 10 years, it would still have to end with the death of either of the two fighters.

Ling Han battled strongly. Though he continued to sustain injuries, his vitality had still reached a new height. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Battling so strongly with such a powerful enemy without any kind of help meant the guillotine of death was just hanging above his head. This caused him to compel himself to extract every single bit of potential he possessed.

On the spectators’ seats, all the cheers were in support of Niu Da, wanting nothing more than for Ling Han to quickly get killed. Best-case scenario, his head could be smashed to bits, and his body blasted into a shower of blood. The more terrible the death, the better.

Ling Han fought alone. It was as if he was opposing the whole heaven and earth with how extremely alone he was.

But his eyes were becoming brighter and brighter. He was a very stubborn man. The more the situation was like this, the higher his fighting spirit would soar, the stronger his determination would be, and the more he wanted to rise up, and then slap the reality into everyone’s face.

Niu Da was also becoming more and more maniacal. This kind of cheering was very infectious, causing his eyes to turn bloodshot as he yearned for Ling Han’s blood.

“Die! Die! Die!” He attacked widely.?Xiu, a death ray shot out of his single horn, and even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would suffer severe injury if he was taken off guard by this.

Ling Han stepped onto the Regulations of Space, dodging this death ray.

He was storing up power for a counterattack, and he would not attack, but if he did, it would definitely be a world-shaking blow.

The enemy was strong, while he himself was weak. He had to succeed with a single blow, or the battle would definitely drag on endlessly.

Niu Da had unleashed his full battle prowess, using even the death ray. He was already keeping nothing back. He wanted to use his strongest offensive to crush Ling Han, and kill him in a single stroke.

Ling Han was calm and silent. Suddenly, his eyes sharpened, and his fighting spirit shot sky-high.

He moved. Regulations of Time surged, and Niu Da’s figure instantly froze for a moment.

However, Niu Da’s strength was too great. Even the Regulations of Time could not imprison him, and he immediately regained his freedom. However, it was just an instant, and Ling Han had also charged towards him, appearing in front of him.

The Divine Demon Sword was already prepared to drink blood.
