Chapter 3406: So You’re Extreme Bone Tier

Translator: Henyee Translations , Editor: Henyee Translations

Yes, this could be used to forge the flying swords. Coincidentally, Ling Han felt that his nine flying swords could no longer keep up with his cultivation level.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Alright, 111 accept it.

Accept your sister, have you already won?

Hu Sihai snorted and said, “As a Three Inscriptions, I’ll make things clear with

you first so that you won’t say that I’m bullying you.”

For an Inscription Tier to fight a Blood Transformation Tier, this was already bullying to the point where he couldn’t be bullied anymore, but who asked Ling Han to take the initiative to challenge him?

Ling Han smiled faintly, crooked his finger, and said, “Come.”

Hu Sihai raised his hands, and sharp nails popped out of his fingers. Each nail was a sharp weapon comparable to the level of the Inscription Tier. The Demon Race was powerful in all aspects in the early stages.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back, appearing calm and relaxed.

“How arrogant. However, this is the only time you can be arrogant,” Hu Sihai said as he charged out. With the enhancement of three times the speed of sound, he instantly arrived in front of Ling Han, and then swung his claw.

Ling Han grinned, and raised his fist to meet the attack.

BANG’.

The collision of the force immediately triggered a huge collision, and then both

were annihilated.

■What!’

Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.

Ling Han could actually contend against an Inscription Tier cultivator, and he was even a Three Inscriptions existence, and a prodigy of the Tiger Clan?

Hu Sihai wasn’t as freakish as Yuwen Hou and could fight with the gap of a major cultivation level. However, his battle prowess had also reached the level of Five Inscriptions. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This was the most inconceivable part. Ling Han was actually not at a

disadvantage?

What a joke, how could there be such a powerful Blood Transformation Tier elite?

Ling Han bared his teeth and fanned his hands. This tiger’s strength was still really great. Even if he used Frequency Attack, there was still a portion of his power that had not dissipated, causing his hands to feel a little numb.

Princess Bixiao revealed a smile, and said, “Congratulations to Grandmaster

Ling for advancing into the Extreme Bone Tier.”

Puff!

Everyone spluttered. What? Ling Han had actually advanced into the Extreme

Bone Tier?

No wonder he could contend against Hu Sihai. A freakish genius like Hong Tianbu could indeed fight with a gap of a major cultivation level and still remain invincible.

That’s not right, didn’t this guy repeatedly injure his foundation when he was in the Blood Transformation Tier? It’s completely impossible for him to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier, so how did he cross over?

What a monster.

Bao Taigong instantly reacted and shouted, “So you’re in the Extreme Bone

Tier, you tricked me!”

Ling Han looked over, and said, “So what if I’m in the Extreme Bone Tier? Did I bully you?”

This…

Bao Taigong was speechless. So what if Ling Han was in the Extreme Bone Tier? He hadn’t suppressed his cultivation level, either. Moreover, Ling Han had just broken through, while he was in the Third Extreme. Although they were both in the Extreme Bone Tier, he definitely had the upper hand.

He couldn’t even win, yet he still had the cheek to blame him?

He didn’t say anything else. Otherwise, he would only embarrass himself.

“Extreme Bone Tier?” Hu Sihai snorted. He had the advantage of an entire cultivation level, so he should have a good chance of winning.

He charged out again like an evil tiger pouncing on its prey.

Ling Han used the Demonic Monkey Fists. Against an elite with Five Inscriptions battle prowess, it was impossible for him to hold back any longer.

Hong, a Primitive Age Demonic Monkey appeared, fusing with the murderous aura formed by Ling Han’s cultivation level of Seventh Change, and pressed down towards Hu Sihai.

One had to know that even Yuwen Hou would be affected by Ling Han’s murderous aura. Hu Sihai was definitely inferior to Yuwen Hou, so how could he possibly withstand it?

He was ensnared, and he couldn’t help but be stunned. Although he immediately recovered, he was still affected in the end, and the power of his palm strike was greatly reduced.

BANG!

The two of them clashed again, and Hu Sihai was instantly sent flying. Ling Han took advantage of his victory and continued to attack. He spread out his fists, and continuously bombarded them.

Hu Sihai parried with all his might. His strength was actually above Ling Han’s, so logically speaking, he should not be afraid of fighting Ling Han head-on. However, under the suppression of his aura, he was unable to fully display his battle prowess, and was actually at a disadvantage in such a confrontation.

Everyone was stunned speechless.

“Peerless prodigy.”

“I think, calling him the second Hong Tianbu is actually a grievance to him. He

is him, Ling Han!”

“That’s right. Hong Tianbu is Hong Tianbu, and Ling Han is Ling Han. They’re both freakish freaks. There’s no such thing as who’s the second.

The humans all nodded. Previously, no matter how freakish Ling Han’s performance was, everyone’s highest evaluation of him was that he was the second Hong Tianbu. In fact, many people felt that Ling Han was not worthy of this title.

Especially since Ling Han had injured his martial arts foundation, everyone felt that Ling Han could only stop at the Blood Transformation Tier, whichmade him even less worthy of the title of being the second Hong Tianbu.

But now, not only had Ling Han advanced into the Extreme Bone Tier, but he had also continued the legend of freakishness.

So what if he was a Three Inscriptions elite?

He was still being suppressed!

Ling Han let out a long cry. He realized that he had still underestimated the power of the Demonic Monkey Fists, as well as the might of the murderous aura formed by the Seventh Change.

He had thought that he would be able to contend against the Three Inscriptions, but now it seemed that a Three Inscriptions could also be defeated.

He could still be invincible even with a gap of a major cultivation level!

“Father is indeed Father. Impressive!” Sixth Baby muttered. “Even in the era of myths, I’m afraid only the peerless Divine Gods and Goddesses can compare to Father.”

“Insignificant human!” Hu Sihai roared. He did not want to be nailed to the pillar of shame. He had the advantage of a complete major tier, yet he had still lost to Ling Han.

The other party was a human!

He roared, and all the hair on his body stood on end. His power increased by more than two times.

“Fierce Tiger Palm!” Hu Sihai channeled his ultimate move and unleashed a palm strike. Coupled with the power of his boiling blood and Qi, this palm strike was terrifying to an indescribable extent.

Boom, under the entanglement of the black energy, Hu Sihai’s battle prowess had already surpassed the peak of Five Inscriptions.

Ling Han did not dare to take it head-on either. After all, his strength was only around the level of One Inscription. Taking such a force head-on was definitely courting death.

However, he did not boil his blood and Qi. Instead, he used his Spiritual power. Xiu, a cold light shot towards Hu Sihai. At seven times the speed of sound, even ordinary Extreme Bone Tier elites would find it difficult to capture the trajectory, and it was extremely likely that they would only react after being struck.

“Petty tricks!” Hu Sihai said disdainfully as he waved his palm to meet the flying sword.

Pu, blood immediately spurted out from his palm.

Hu Sihai was in pain. He saw a small sword stabbed into his palm, right up to the hilt. He couldn’t help but be shocked. Under the eruption of the Demon Race, the increase in power was indeed inferior to the mystical power of the human race, but the defense would also increase. Overall, it was definitely not inferior to the human race.

However, under the circumstances where his defense had skyrocketed, his palm was still pierced through by Ling Han’s sword.

Hiss, how terrifying was this attack power?

“What a strong spiritual power!” he said. It could actually pierce through his palm. Its power was really terrifying. Moreover, what would happen if this sword pierced his eye instead of his palm?

“Human!” Hu Sihai gritted his teeth.

Before embarking on the path of immortality, the Demon Race would completely crush the human race. However, the human race did not have no advantage at all, and their advantage was Spiritual Power..

The Demon Race was born with a strong physique. With mystical power and physical power, their power would definitely surpass that of cultivators of the same level. However, in terms of Spiritual Power, the Demon Race would be at a disadvantage. Therefore, there were almost no alchemists or Formation Masters in the Demon Race.

The opponent in front of him made him feel that he was extremely difficult to deal with..
