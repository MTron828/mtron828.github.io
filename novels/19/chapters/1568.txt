Chapter 1569 Rising Commotion

Ling Han had already reaped fairly rich rewards. When crossing the sea, he had obtained many Godly medicines, and had even obtained a Saint Fruit. When ascending the mountain, he had also obtained many Divine Pills and secret techniques. As long as he could obtain the Chaos Source Rock now, this trip could be viewed as perfect.Following Cheng Fu’s guidance, he continued to weave through the colossal pillars of the temple. Along the way, he witnessed many strange and peculiar scenes.

This temple wasn’t a simple structure. Instead, it was composed of many small worlds, with each room in the temple potentially being boundless in size. If he took one wrong step, it was possible that he would become lost in a small world. At that time, he would need heavens knew how long to find his way back out.

No wonder Cheng Fu dared to claim that no one under the level of Celestial King could breach this formation.

However, so what if one was a Celestial King? Take the Celestial King of the Cheng Clan, for example. Wasn’t he surrounded and attacked, resulting in the destruction of the Cheng Clan? Their ancestral ground was massacred, and even though it had managed to flee from the Celestial Realm, almost all of the clan members had been killed.

After walking for several hours, Ling Han finally arrived before a stone room. He then opened the door using the method that Cheng Fu taught him before stepping in. He immediately arrived above a galaxy, in the center of which there hovered a gigantic rock that was radiating with an indescribable glow.

This was the Chaos Source Rock.

Ling Han determined this with a single glance. During his time in the Lower Realm, he had also obtained a Chaos Source Rock once. However, it was Hu Niu who had helped him absorb it into the Black Tower. He didn’t know whether he could replicate this now.

“The Chaos Source Rock is a precious treasure, even in the Celestial Realm,” Cheng Fu said with emotion. “When charged with Source Power, it can help raise the level of one’s physique. The Cheng Clan relied on this Chaos Source Rock to nurture countless prodigies. However, it’s a shame that those under the level of Celestial King were nothing but cannon fodder during the great turmoil.

“Young man, my task here is done. Take this Chaos Source Rock and leave. I’ll seal this ancestral ground afterward, and only our ancestor will be able to find it.”

Weng!

The Chaos Source Rock started to hover toward Ling Han.

Ling Han hurriedly absorbed it into his spatial ring. To his surprise, it actually worked. By the looks of it, he could suppress the ability of the Chaos Source Rock after advancing to the Immortal level—he hadn’t been able to do this the previous time. That was most likely because he had still been too weak, meaning that he hadn’t had the ability to use the Chaos Source Rock.

Boom!

The world he was in suddenly started to crumble. Before he knew it, Ling Han had already reappeared on a barren and desolate planet. In the distance, there were a dozen or so Demon Masters standing with their hands clasped behind their backs.

The time limit was a mere three years, and to Demon Masters, this was as quick as the blink of an eye. Thus, there had been no need for them to return. They remained here to discuss dao, and three years flew by just like that.

Not only Ling Han, but the others had also been kicked out of the mystery realm. From today onward, the Ocean Dragon Mountain would disappear forever.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. It seemed like every mystery realm that he entered would reach the end of its lifespan—he was much like a star of misfortune.

“Hmm?” Tan Feng’s expression involuntarily darkened as he swept his gaze across the cultivators. “Where’s Tan Mo?”

“Sixth Elder, Brother Mo was killed!” the four members of the Tan Clan hurriedly exclaimed. They finally had someone powerful to rely on now.

“What?!” Tan Feng exclaimed in shock.

How was this possible?

“Who killed him?” he hurriedly asked. “Was it the Black Demon power in the mystery realm?”

“It was him!” the four members of the Tan Clan replied as they pointed at Ling Han.

Shua!

Everyone turned around to look at Ling Han, including the 18 Demon Masters.

However, the 18 Demon Masters all shook their heads, a doubtful expression on their faces.

How could this be possible?

Tan Mo was at the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, and his power was more so at another level compared to Mo Li and the other big shots. Who under the level of Genesis Tier could kill him?

Ling Han?

Even the Hysteria Demon Master—who knew about his freakish talent—wasn’t convinced that he possessed the ability to kill Tan Mo. After all, this was analogous to claiming that a sheep had defeated and killed a lion. It couldn’t be possible no matter how he thought about it.

“It was genuinely him!” the four members of the Tan Clan exclaimed when they saw the cold gaze of Tan Feng sweep over. They hurriedly explained what had happened, also revealing that Ling Han possessed a Demonic Tool and was surprisingly able to fully activate it.

The Demon Masters were astonished by what they heard. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

An Eternal River Tier elite had managed to fully activate a Demonic Tool?

Preposterous!

They started to verify these claims with their disciples and descendants, and after hearing their answers, their expressions of astonishment grew even deeper.

This young man... was extremely strange!

Meanwhile, Tan Feng was seething with killing intent as he locked his gaze onto Ling Han.

This person had actually dared to kill a member of the Tan Clan, the most prodigious Tan Mo, no less! He was the hope of the Tan Clan, and he was a prodigy who they believed could continue to shine even after entering the Celestial Realm.

“Die!” Tan Feng roared. He didn’t hesitate before attacking Ling Han.

Taking revenge for Tan Mo was only one part of his motive. Apart from that, he was also attracted by the two Demonic Tools and one Saint Fruit that Ling Han possessed. Thus, he didn’t hesitate before attacking.

“Humph!” The Hysteria Demon Master was prepared for this, and he immediately launched his palm in reply. It transformed into a streak of black light as it shot toward Tan Feng.

Tan Feng had no option but to turn around and block. He was confident that he was more powerful than the Hysteria Demon Master, but he still wasn’t arrogant enough to face his attack without putting up any defenses. Glancing back, he saw that Ling Han had already seized this opportunity to hide behind the Hysteria Demon Master.

“Are you seeking death?” he asked balefully. The Hysteria Demon Master was a mere Yellow Demon, and he was nothing in the eyes of the Tan Clan. Several of their elders could suppress him with ease.

The Hysteria Demon Master flicked his sleeves, and said, “When one enters a mystery realm, they take responsibility for their own life and death! Moreover, Ling Han killed Tan Mo as the weaker of the two, so one can only say that Tan Mo lost because his skills were inferior. If you continue to act so shamelessly, don’t blame me for looking at you with disdain!”

If it were possible, he truly didn’t want to engage in battle with Tan Feng. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have made an exception and allowed the five members of the Tan Clan to enter. However, he also owed Ling Han, so he definitely wouldn’t allow Ling Han to die before he repaid him. At the very least, he wouldn’t allow Ling Han to die before his eyes.

Tan Feng sneered, and said, “No one has ever dared to kill a disciple of the Tan Clan. This can’t change now! This brat needs to die. If you insist on protecting him, then you’ll also need to die! Everyone around you will need to die!”

How domineering!

The remaining 16 Demon Masters all wore expressions of fury. Tan Feng was being far too arrogant! He had come uninvited into their territory, and now he was even acting with such wanton disregard! Did he truly think that they were harmless statues?

“Heh, let me test your skills then!” the Overlord Sword Demon Master said as he stepped forward. There was a flickering battle intent in his eyes. Although he had fought the Hysteria Demon Master for countless years, arguing over the problem of who was more powerful, his relationship with him was actually quite amicable.

He had purposefully made a bet with the Hysteria Demon Master, and his aim was actually to become family with him through marriage. Thus, he naturally had to step forward and battle alongside him now.

“Who else is there?” Tan Feng asked in scorn. “If you want to die, then hurry up and step forward. I’ll remember each of you, lest I kill the wrong person in the future!”

The Demon Masters were enraged upon hearing this. Which of them wasn’t a ruler of an entire galaxy? They were paramount beings no one would dare to disobey. They remained silent as they stepped forward, yet their reply was as clear as could be.

“Heh, very well! Very well!” Tan Feng said as he chuckled. He then suddenly looked up at one corner of the sky.

Weng!

A golden path materialized in the air, releasing a devastating aura that instantly enveloped the surroundings.
