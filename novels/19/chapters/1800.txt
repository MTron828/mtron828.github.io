Chapter 1801: White Demon Tree

“Sh*tty dog, are you asking for a beating?” Ling Han said with a dark expression.

“Hehe, judging from your lack of strength, you’re definitely suffering from renal deficiency!” the large black dog said as he pushed Ling Han’s shoulder. He was standing on his hind legs like a human, and he continued in a suggestive voice, “Take care to nourish yourself. Otherwise, your neighbor adulterer might seize this opportunity to do something untoward.”

“Piss off!” Ling Han said as he tried to kick the large black dog aside.

However, the large black dog nimbly dodged his kick before saying with a solemn expression, “Fine, I won’t joke around with you anymore. Say, why are you so uptight? This White Demon Tree can absorb all kinds of auras and ultimately form a murderous aura. If you can refine this aura, your attacks will be imbued with a soaring murderous aura. They’ll be incredibly astounding.

“Moreover, if you’re fortunate enough, you might even be able to cultivate the Regulation of Slaughter from this aura. At that time, you’ll possess an overwhelming advantage even if you come across fellow kings among kings.”

Ling Han was slightly puzzled, and he said, “Little Black, you don’t seem like a good person at all, so why are you suddenly doing something good?”

“F*ck! It’s because you seem decent that I’m giving you this opportunity. If you don’t want it, then so be it!” The large black dog huffed.

“Why don’t you take it for yourself?” Ling Han asked.

It had been much the same during their trip through the Han Clan’s mountain of treasures. They had obtained the Seven Lives Divine Cloud, yet the large black dog hadn’t asked for any of it from Ling Han. Now that they had come across the White Demon Tree, he was acting in a similar fashion again.

Thinking even further back, the large black dog had never taken advantage of him even though he would screw him over from time to time. In fact, Ling Han had always gotten the better end of the deals.

This was inconsistent with the large black dog’s personality.

“I’m a Divine Hound of Heaven and Earth, and I was born powerful and mighty. As such, I don’t need help from these external matters!” the large black dog said with a haughty expression.

“Go on, keep boasting!” Ling Han said. He naturally didn’t believe the large black dog. Perhaps this large black dog was extremely patient and cunning, and it was planning to help him reach a supreme cultivation level, at which time it would snatch his fruits of cultivation.

Or perhaps this detestable dog was truly helping him and acting in his best interests.

However, did such unconditional love truly exist in the world?

“You can trust this detestable dog!” Small Tower suddenly said.

Ling Han was astonished, and he asked, “How do you know? Huh? It can’t be that you were already acquainted with him since long ago, right?”

This wasn’t impossible.

After all, the large black dog had been dug out from some ancient site in the Celestial Realm by Gu Daoyi during his first lifetime. Even though he had only been a pup at that time, it was hard to say whether the large black dog was in his second lifetime, third lifetime, or even fourth lifetime.

As long as their divine sense was powerful enough, Celestials could easily change their physical body.

Small Tower pondered for a moment before saying, “I still have yet to recover much of my memories. However, I have a feeling that this detestable dog is trustworthy.”

“You guys were definitely acquainted before!” Ling Han said with certainty. Otherwise, how could Small Tower have developed such a feeling? Why didn’t Small Tower develop such feelings toward other people? Moreover, the large black dog was also extremely helpful and caring of him. Although the large black dog always screwed him over, it was without a doubt that he cared for him like a senior cared for their junior.

The Tower of Three Realms and the large black dog... Just what kind of relationship did they have in the past?

Ling Han didn’t question Small Tower anymore. Regardless of whether it was Small Tower or the large black dog, both of them had large gaps in their memories. Even if they didn’t, they were still unwilling to go into great detail about this topic. Thus, it was useless to press them any further.

“Let’s go and get the tree heart,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

“Demonized Tree Heart!” the large black dog stressed.

The three “people” walked into the village. In fact, even the tallest walls here could only reach their knees. As such, their vision wasn’t obstructed at all, and it was as if the White Demon Tree was resting right before them. Anyhow, apart from its shape, this White Demon Tree didn’t seem like a tree at all. There were numerous human faces on the trunk of the tree, and this sight was as hair-raising and harrowing as could be.

“Huh? Something’s not right!” the large black dog exclaimed and suddenly stopped. He carefully observed the White Demon Tree.

“What’s wrong?” Ling Han asked and halted. He immediately held the Empress back. He also found the White Demon Tree extremely uncanny and strange, especially the numerous faces on its trunk.

“Something’s very wrong!” The large black dog shook his head, and said, “In fact, everything here seems a little off.”

“White Demon Tree!” someone behind them suddenly exclaimed in astonishment. They then hurriedly dashed over, completely ignoring the presence of Ling Han and the others. They resolutely charged toward the White Demon Tree.

If the other party hadn’t been so arrogant and frantic, Ling Han would have called out in warning. However, since the former was so intent on snatching the treasure, why did Ling Han need to warn him of any potential dangers?

Meanwhile, the large black dog was even more evil, saying, “Just at the right time. We can use this ugly fool to probe the White Demon Tree and see what’s wrong with it.”

This was a man of around 30 years old in appearance. At this moment, he had already drawn his broadsword and hacked at the White Demon Tree.

In any case, only the tree heart was useful, and the man had simply hacked his broadsword at the root of the tree. As such, he wouldn’t damage the tree heart by accident. Moreover, he had also noticed that something was off with the White Demon Tree, so he appeared much more careful than just then.

Although he hadn’t used his full power, the might of his hack was still fairly immense. A glow of Regulations appeared on the blade of the broadsword, and it was as if it were unleashing the fury of the heavens.

At this moment, an uncanny sight suddenly appeared. As if it were alive, the trunk of the tree surprisingly split apart and furiously released a burst of green mist, completely enveloping the man. When the green mist disappeared, the man was already completely trapped.

The green mist had transformed into a sticky liquid, and not only was it incredibly sticky, but it was also extremely tough. The man wasn’t able to break free from it no matter what he did. His face was green with fright. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was also at this moment that he discovered that the sticky liquid possessed a powerful toxin that was coursing through his body, and causing him to become weaker and weaker.

“Shatter!” he roared as he unleashed his Origin Power Protective Barrier, and furiously resisted the invasion of the poisonous sticky liquid. However, his protective barrier was barely effective, and it looked as if it were about to collapse at any moment.

Meanwhile, a vine suddenly shot out from the trunk of the White Demon Tree, and it wrapped around the man like a tongue and pulled him toward the tree.

“Save me!” the man shouted as he looked toward Ling Han and the Empress. When he saw the Empress, he couldn’t help but feel stunned by her breathtaking beauty. In fact, he even forgot to shout for help for a brief moment.

The Empress had already reverted to her original appearance, so it was only natural that her beauty was astounding and irresistible. How could one not be attracted by her stunning beauty?

Ling Han chuckled as he lunged toward the White Demon Tree, with his Nine Heavens Flame transforming into a Divine Sword as he did so. He wasn’t charging over to specifically save the man, but rather couldn’t be bothered to wait any longer.

Boom!

As the flaming sword slashed over, the White Demon Tree immediately released another burst of green mist toward Ling Han.

“Shatter!” Ling Han shouted as he swung his sword.

This was also a slashing attack, yet Ling Han’s attack was evidently different from the man’s. As his flaming blade soared over, the green mist was instantly reduced to ashes.

Just how devastating was the Nine Heavens Flame?

Ling Han immediately unleashed another slash.

Pu!

There was a flash of Sword Qi, and the “tongue” that was wrapped around the man was immediately severed. Ling Han unleashed several more strikes, and as flames burst forth, even the green liquid on the man was burnt to a crisp.

The man hurriedly crawled up from the ground, and sprinted back wherever he had come from. He had already been scared out of his mind.

Meanwhile, Ling Han continued to advance toward the White Demon Tree.

At this moment, the faces on the White Demon Tree suddenly started to contort, and the trunk of the tree also started to split apart.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Numerous headless corpses collapsed onto the ground. These corpses were filled with countless wounds and holes due to corrosion, yet they surprisingly started to crawl up.

This was as eerie as could be.
