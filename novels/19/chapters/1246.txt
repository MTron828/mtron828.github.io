Chapter 1247: Love Letter

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Have we met before?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked in slight confusion.

This man looked extremely unfamiliar, yet the look in his eyes gave her a familiar feeling. In fact, it actually sent a slight ripple through her heart, which had already been unfeeling toward the opposite gender for a long time.

‘As expected of my wife! Sure enough, she’s caught onto something!’

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I’m sure we haven’t.”

“That’s right, handsome brother, what’s your name?” There were quite a lot of young women in this brigade, and many of them winked at him meaningfully and boldly.

Ling Han glanced at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden before replying, “Ling Han.”

“Ah!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden involuntarily let out a soft cry.

“Sister Heavenly Phoenix, what’s wrong?” a few women asked as they looked at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook her head, and said, “It’s nothing.” This was probably a case of two people having the same name. Her Ling Han had died in the Lower Realm over 10,000 years ago.

“Ladies, I have a lot of alchemical pills on me. I guarantee they can treat all kinds of wounds and cure all kinds of illnesses.” Ling Han decided to win their trust, so he retrieved a large number of alchemical pills.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was clearly going to remain in the Purple Moon Army for quite a while longer. However, the Purple Moon Army didn’t really welcome men. Thus, Ling Han wanted to get on good terms with these female soldiers so that they could look after the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden for him.

The women were all overjoyed. Alchemical pills were one of the most valuable things in the cultivation world. Although a single pill wasn’t as expensive as a God Tool, the fact that they were expendable items made them far more expensive in the long run.

Yet, Ling Han was actually handing out a large number of alchemical pills! He was being so generous that it was almost profligate.

“It’s fine, I’m an alchemist, so this is nothing,” Ling Han said with a smile.

The female soldiers were stunned upon hearing this.

He was an alchemist! These were people who enjoyed a transcendent standing. Alchemists were also divided into 20 minor levels, each of which corresponded to a cultivation level. Moreover, if an alchemist and a cultivator were of a corresponding level, the alchemist would definitely enjoy a higher standing.

This was determined by demand.

The eyes of many female soldiers lit up. The cultivation world was brutal—although cultivators seemed mighty and glorious, no one knew whether they would live to see the next day. However, alchemists enjoyed a far safer life. As long as they didn’t involve themselves in disputes between cultivators, they would enjoy a transcendent standing as someone who was respected and needed by everyone.

Thus, if they wanted to marry someone, alchemists would definitely be the best choice.

“Grandmaster Ling, what level alchemist are you?” some female soldiers asked.

“I just became a Level Eight alchemist,” Ling Han replied with a smile. In order to help his wife, Ling Han was truly going all out.

Upon hearing this, not only were the younger soldiers charmed, but even older soldiers at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier became attracted. There was a bright glimmer in their eyes as they gazed at him, and it was almost as if they could swallow him whole.

He was definitely a wealthy man!

However, whether or not he was genuinely a Level Eight alchemist still needed verification. After all, he had merely claimed this himself.

Anyhow, Ling Han only wanted them to hold him in slightly higher regard. That way, he would have an excuse to tag along with them. After all, he was only an alchemist, so his “battle prowess” was naturally very weak.

Although the Purple Moon Army forbade men from joining, this didn’t mean that the women in the army all despised men. In reality, the large majority of them were very normal. In fact, there was even a small number of them who were especially open and promiscuous.

Living in this place meant that there was a risk of dying at any time. Thus, the relationships between men and women also became far more relaxed and casual. If it wasn’t for the military regulations of the Purple Moon Army, perhaps they would have become a prostitute army already.

With his identity as an alchemist, Ling Han naturally captured the hearts of many young women. This made him realize that he had perhaps overdone it.

However, for the sake of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he still retrieved his cauldron and refined some pills. Divine Pills under Level Five could be refined in under a day, and the large majority of the Purple Moon Army was also at the Mountain River Tier. Thus, Ling Han’s standing with their army climbed exponentially when he refined and distributed these pills.

Although some of them still refused to believe that he was a Level Eight alchemist, with his young age and all, they admitted that he was at least a Level Four alchemist.

However, being a Level Four alchemist was still extremely impressive. After all, Ling Han was far too young. If he was already a Level Four alchemist at such a young age, how difficult would it be for him to become a Level Five, Six, or even Eight alchemist in the future?

Thus, after a few days of interaction, at least 90% of the female soldiers had their hearts captured by Ling Han. If they had spare time, they would run to his tent to flirt with him.

“Sister Heavenly Phoenix, help me deliver this letter to Grandmaster Ling!”

In a small and dense forest, a middle-aged woman tugged at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s sleeve as she handed her a folded letter.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t help but feel astonished. This middle-aged woman was called Zhu Liyun, and she was a good friend that she had made in the Purple Moon Army. Their cultivation levels were identical, yet Zhu Liyun was far older than her. In fact, she was already over 1,800,000 years old. Thus, even taking into account the lifespan of an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, she was still a middle-aged woman.

“Big Sister Yun, don’t tell me you’re attracted to that person?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said with a smile.

An embarrassed smile appeared on Zhu Liyun’s face, and she said, “Even you’re teasing me!” She stomped her foot lightly as she spoke.

Seeing this middle-aged woman act like a young girl, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t but chuckle, and asked, “Why don’t you deliver it yourself?”

“I’m embarrassed, of course!” Zhu Liyun appeared especially fidgety as she spoke.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook her head, and said, “That person might not actually be a Level Eight alchemist. Moreover...” She didn’t want to say this directly. Ling Han was so young, so why would he be attracted to a middle-aged woman?

There were so many young and beautiful women throwing themselves at him, so how could he settle for someone like Zhu Liyun? Not only was she old, but her appearance was also far too ordinary.

“Are you worried that sister isn’t beautiful enough?” A confident smile spread across Zhu Liyun’s face, and she said, “Looks aren’t everything. Moreover, I’m at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, so there’s a great chance that I’ll advance to the Heavenly Body Tier in the future. If he’s smart, he’ll know that marrying me is most beneficial to him.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t help but shake her head in her mind. By the looks of it, her friend wasn’t truly in love with Ling Han. Instead, she was in love with his identity of an alchemist. In the end, she nodded, and said, “Okay, I’ll deliver the letter for Big Sister Yun.”

“Remember to say some good things about me!” Zhu Liyun hurriedly pulled the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden back, and said, “You’re extremely beautiful, so men will definitely listen to you.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden frowned upon hearing this, a hint of displeasure on her face.

“Ah, look at me, I accidentally made my sister unhappy.” Zhu Liyun hurriedly apologized, saying, “Sister said that by accident, so don’t take it to heart.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded, and said, “I’ll deliver the letter for you, sister.”

She walked to Ling Han’s tent, and asked, “Is Grandmaster Ling here?”

“Yes!” Ling Han immediately walked out from his tent upon hearing this voice. Although he had captured the hearts of numerous middle-aged and young women, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden wasn’t one of them. Moreover, she had purposefully kept her distance from him, giving him no opportunity to talk to her one-on-one.

Now, his opportunity had finally come.

A look of displeasure appeared on the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s face when she saw Ling Han’s passionate gaze. However, she was here at the request of her friend, so she still handed the letter to him, saying, “One of my sisters asked me to deliver this letter to you. She’s a shy person, so she was too embarrassed to deliver it by herself.”

‘Love letter?’ Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han guessed the contents of the letter after taking a glance at it. A strange look appeared on his face.

‘Wife, oh wife, you’re actually delivering a love letter for another woman? Do you know what on earth you’re doing?’
