Chapter 1192: Opening the Treasure Storage

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There was almost no one here.

Everyone knew that this was a desolate land, so who would waste their time coming here?

A dark and eerie aura rose from the ground, reaching a height of around six meters. It continued to change into all shapes and forms, and it appeared especially uncanny.

However, this aura wasn’t dangerous. Ling Han had never heard about anyone dying from breathing in this aura.

“Is this a remnant from the great battle of the past?” Ling Han said in speculation.

Several more days passed, and a palace appeared before them. This palace was built at the foot of a mountain, and the origin of the Yellow Spring was none other than this mountain. The Yellow Spring flowed down from it and transformed into the river that crashed through the sky.

“Why don’t you two enter the Black Tower,” Ling Han said. He didn’t want Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun to face any danger.

Shui Yanyu nodded in understanding. From this point on, she couldn’t help Ling Han any longer. Not only that, but she would even be a burden on him. Thus, it was better for her to enter the Black Tower and cultivate earnestly so that she could increase her strength. That way, she could strive to be of more help in the future.

Meanwhile, Hu Feiyun was a bit reluctant to enter. She was an extremely curious person, and she was thoroughly interested in this place—even though the eerie aura of the surroundings made her hair stand on ends. She didn’t want to miss any of the excitement.

After lots of encouragement and lies, they finally managed to convince Hu Feiyun to enter the Black Tower.

“I want to enter too!” the old ginseng said. His eyes dashed about in excitement.

Ling Han knew that this ginseng was having perverted thoughts again. He wanted to tease the two women while Ling Han wasn’t present. However... hehehe, that was the Black Tower! And there was even a Saint inside!

“Sure!” Ling Han nodded, and said, “Stand still and don’t move.”

He wrapped his divine sense around the old ginseng, and then brought him into the Black Tower. If his divine sense was stronger than his target’s, he wouldn’t need to seek their agreement—he could forcefully drag them into the Black Tower. However, the old ginseng was astonishingly quick, so Ling Han would have no way of wrapping his divine sense around him if he didn’t stand still.

“F*ck! What is this place?

“Also, what’s with this tree? Why do I feel like I’ve met my ancient ancestor?

“F*ck! What’s with this orb of light? It seems terrifying!

“Wah, hurry up and let me out!”

The old ginseng was curious at first, but his curiosity quickly became astonishment, and his astonishment quickly became terror. He wailed in fright.

Ling Han couldn’t care less about him, and he strode toward the palace that rested at the foot of the mountain. This was the final stop of the mystery realm.

He arrived at the entrance of the palace. The entrance was tightly shut, and there were already five people standing in front of it—apart from Kuang Peishan, the other king tiers had all arrived.

“Brother Ling!” The five people all nodded at him in greeting. They didn’t seem jealous of him just because he had obtained four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid.

Perhaps they were, but they had hidden it deep within their hearts. King tier prodigies like them all had a firm conviction that they were invincible. Why would they need to be jealous of others?

Ling Han nodded, and said, “You’ve all arrived fairly early.”

“Hehe, we only arrived a short while ago,” Shi Anguo said with a chuckle. A hint of apprehension flashed across his eyes as he looked at Ling Han.

In terms of battle prowess alone, he had a crushing advantage over Ling Han. However, if they were to battle to the death, Ling Han would definitely emerge victorious. The reason for this was simple. Ling Han’s defense was far too terrifying, and it would be impossible for him to crack it.

Such opponents frightened him.

“Junior Sister Kuang still hasn’t arrived yet. She probably came across some great opportunity on her way here,” Wu Wentong said.

Their king tier strength meant that they were invincible in this mystery realm. Thus, there was no way that Kuang Peishan was late due to facing a powerful enemy.

They sat down and started discussing dao. There was nothing better for them to do anyway.

As king tiers, all six of them had reached the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier. As such, they were supremely talented in the field of cultivation. They all gained a lot from their discussions.

After waiting for two days, Kuang Peishan finally arrived.

“Righto, let’s begin!”

There were 14 indentations on the large door of the palace, and each one was just large enough to fit a hand. The seven of them stood side by side, and they each placed their hands into two indentations.

“Push when I count to three,” He Tao said.

“Mm-hm!” The six other king tiers all nodded in acknowledgement. Right now, they naturally wouldn’t argue about who was issuing the commands.

“One!

“Two!

“Three!”

The seven king tiers unleashed their full power as they pushed on the door.

When their power reached seven stars above the peak stage of the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier, the indentations below their hands lit up.

Two, four, six, eight... When all 14 of the indentations lit up, there was a cracking sound, and the tightly shut door of the palace slowly started to open.

However, the seven king tiers all stepped back, cautious expressions on their faces.

Before this potentially astonishing treasure storage, they became even more careful than before. They didn’t let greed cloud their eyes and judgment.

The palace had been pitch-black before. However, when the door fully opened, the columns inside started to light up one after another. After a short while, the entire palace was brightly illuminated.

Gasp!

The seven king tiers all gasped in surprise. This was because a corpse was sprawled 30 or so meters before them.

This person had to have been extremely tall, and they would have measured at least nine meters in height if they were upright. Their entire body was blue, and they were dressed in a damaged suit of armor. In fact, there were gaping wounds on their body, and even their bones could be seen.

There were a few lines of words carved next to the corpse.

“When the seven stars align, ’tis the time my successor appears.

“Dark demons of the Netherworld, kill them, kill them, kill them!

“The Heaven is unjust, despicable, detestable, deplorable!”

He Tao pondered for a moment, and said, “The seven stars are clearly referring to us. We’ve all cultivated to the pinnacle level, and we had to work together to open the door to this palace. Also, my successor appears... Is this saying that one of us will receive his inheritance?”

Shen Zhu’er took a few steps forward, and her expression suddenly changed drastically. She hurriedly retreated to her original position, and said, “This senior is far too powerful. I’m not able to near him at all! It was as if a murderous aura were about to rip me into shreds!”

Ling Han had been squatting down before, and he stood up at this moment, and said, “The tiles in this palace are also incredibly sturdy. I used my Divine Sword on it, but I still couldn’t leave a mark.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

One had to realize that the words on the floor had most likely been engraved by the blue-skinned elite before he had died. Moreover, he had probably done so using his fingers. There were no weapons in his hand, and his index finger was resting on the last character of the message.

Ling Han hadn’t been able to leave a mark using a Divine Sword, yet the blue-skinned elite had been able to engrave a message using his finger. The massive gulf between them couldn’t be more evident.

The seven king tiers walked around the corpse. Although this blue-skinned elite had died long ago, remnants of his might still lingered over his corpse. It was simply impossible for them to near him. Even though they were all prodigies who had reached the pinnacle level, they still appeared especially insignificant before such a mighty being.

“He was definitely an Eternal River Tier elite!

“Although I can’t fathom the cultivation of Venerable Trinity, this senior gives off a similar feeling to him. He’s definitely far above the Heavenly Body Tier!”

“Then his inheritance...”

“Is tremendously valuable!”

Shen Zhu’er and the others were all were all moved upon realizing this. How incredible would it be if they were to receive the inheritance of an Eternal River Tier elite?

Although Venerable Trinity had also taken in nine disciples, he would definitely withhold some of his inheritances. He would leave his most important inheritance until the end and only teach it to one of his disciples. His other disciples were destined to receive only part of his inheritance.

However, the situation right now was different. This blue-skinned elite had died long ago, and thus the inheritance that he left was definitely complete.

Who wouldn’t be moved?
