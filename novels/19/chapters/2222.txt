Chapter 2223: Conflict

Ling Huo smiled proudly. He was no ordinary monarch tier, but manifested from the Source Power of heaven and earth, and possessed a sliver of Celestial King Tier might.

In other words, before the Celestial King Tier, he would be stronger than a typical monarch tier, and could be considered a top-grade monarch tier. However, compared with freaks like Ling Han and Ji Wuming, he was still slightly inferior.

What right did a king tier have to act arrogant in front of him?

Even if he was two minor levels higher, it would still be useless!

He also raised his fists to greet the oncoming attack from the middle-aged man, and what he was using was shockingly the Fists of Fury—the nine great Source Powers of heaven and earth had initially been fused with Ling Han, so they naturally possessed all the celestial techniques that Ling Han had grasped.

Of course, now that they had been separated, and gained their independence, all the ultimate techniques that Ling Han comprehended and cultivated in the future would have no relation to them any longer.

Fists of Fury blasted out, their might shaking the heavens.

The middle-aged man instantly fell into a disadvantage. In the first place, he was no match for Ling Huo, what more now when the latter had used the Fists of Fury.

Peng!

Over a dozen moves later, a punch landed on his left shoulder. He stumbled backwards continuously, and when he turned his head to look, he saw that there was a charred print of a fist left on his shoulder, which was still emanating the aroma of barbequed meat.

The middle-aged man was both furious and shocked. Suddenly, he pointed at Clear Heaven Pass in the skies, mumbling something under his breath. Whatever he was muttering could not be discerned at all, right until the end when he shouted loudly. A streak of silvery light shot out of Clear Heaven Pass, and shone on him.

Boom, his aura suddenly soared rapidly, as if it had been strengthened several times in an instant.

“Suppress!” he shot out, and battled fiercely with Ling Huo once more.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The power of Regulation resonated, forming a brilliant Light of Dao that was incredibly intense.

What shocked Ling Han and the others was that this guy actually managed to fight Ling Huo to a tie.

This powerful stronghold could actually increase the power of cultivators?

Ling Han couldn’t help but recall the Deity that was worshipped by the force of darkness. Wasn’t it also a statue, yet could grant a power boost of around 10 times to one’s battle prowess? This was extremely amazing.

Ling Huo’s temper was also ignited with the battle. His body took the form of fiery flames, capable of melting all other Regulations.

He was a Source Power of heaven and earth, so it would be strange if his battle prowess was not strong.

After the fierce battle continued for about half a day, the middle-aged man’s aura suddenly trembled, and became incredibly unstable. Then, it declined rapidly, and his battle prowess also fell drastically as well, as if the power boost granted to him by Clear Heaven Pass had already been exhausted.

Ling Huo took the opportunity to attack fiercely.?Peng, peng, peng, the middle-aged man was sent back into continuous retreat. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Li Hongfei, you drew on the power of Clear Heaven Pass, and actually did not manage to defeat a First Secret cultivator?” Another man walked out, similarly dressed in animal hide, appearing incredibly gruff and coarse.

The middle-aged man from before wiped the trace of blood at the corner of his lips, and his fighting spirit became even more uplifted instead of reducing. He humphed, and declared, “Deng Li, don’t interfere in my affairs!”

The man that came later smirked coldly, and retorted, “You can only use the power of Clear Heaven Pass once a month, yet have wasted it here. It is already displeasing to Lord Nie, who has especially commanded that I come to take a look.”

He paused, and then continued, “Weren’t you asked to investigate the identities of these people? Why have you gotten into battle with them?”

Li Hongfei humphed, and replied, “These people claim that they come from the Saintly Origin Academy.”

“Saintly Origin Academy?” Deng Li’s eyes swept over Ling Han and the others, and similarly looked disdainful. “Is that the academy that was co-founded by the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? Humph, they have so many resources at their disposal, but they are all such trash!”

“If these resources had been used on us, we would have been able to advance into the Ascending Origin Tier!” Li Hongfei declared, nodding.

“Let me ask you. Since you are the disciples of Saintly Origin Academy, why have you come so late?” Deng Li shouted this question at Ling Han and his group.

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “You two are merely guides. What right do you have to interrogate us?”

“Just answer whatever question you are asked. Spare the nonsense!” Deng Li exclaimed impatiently. Just like Li Hongfei, he was filled with envy and disdain towards Ling Han and those who had grown up in a safe, peaceful environment.

Ling Han chuckled. “Initially, I have been quite respectful of you guys, but you are so determined to ruin these affections. Now, I can’t be bothered to waste words on you. I will give you two options. First, invite us into the city, or second, I will capture both of you, and then you can bring us into the city. Which do you choose?”

“Hehe, you are trying to overwhelm us with numbers?” Deng Li smirked coldly. “You are truly naive. This is Clear Heaven Pass, and we have multiplied who knows how many generations here, and you are trying to compare with us in numbers?”

He took out a bull’s horn, but it was entirely golden. Then, he put it to his mouth and spoke a few words into it. In a short while, multiple streaks of light surged beneath the great city, revealing one person after another.

There were men and women. Some men were dressed very simply, that was in a piece of animal hide. Some men’s attire was no different with the others of the Celestial Realm—embroidered robes, which looked very luxurious.

But the women’s attire were all completely long skirts and beautifully made up. They had all carefully matched their attire.

Deng Li smiled proudly, and declared, “In terms of numbers, we have more!”

As he spoke, these people had already walked to stand next to Deng Li and Li Hongfei. There were a total of 17 of them, and added with Deng Li and Li Hongfei, they totalled 19. Though their manner of dress differed, as they stood there, they were all exuding an aura akin to primitive beasts.

This was an aura that could only be formed after experiencing countless battles, it was also through this aura that they could be distinguished as the natives of Clear Heaven Pass.

Ling Han stated calmly, “We have come to the Clear Heaven Pass under command of a Clear Heaven Pass, so why must you cause trouble for us?”

“Having beaten up one of us, you say it is us causing the trouble?” A native immediately jumped out. Though he was dressed in embroidered robes, it could not conceal the primitive air he exuded. He appeared incredibly irritable. “We have bled and sacrificed for the Celestial Realm; we are not here to suffer your insults and humiliation!”

This accusation was too severe.

Ling Han shook his head, and retorted, “Just to sentence us with crime, there is no lack of words. Come on then. Since you guys love to fight so much, come, all of you together. I will then beat you into submission.”

“Impudence!” Li Hongfei and the others cried out in rebuke.

Ling Han smiled. “Wasn’t it a fight you wanted? Why do you have to be so reserved?”

“No need to waste words on them. We’ll capture them and beat them up first; take them a notch down,” Deng Li declared impatiently.

“Right, beat them up first, then talk,” one woman said aggressively.

All 19 of them looked keen and eager; the eyes they directed at Ling Han made it seem like they were fierce wolves that had spotted a rabbit.

Ling Han turned to Ling Huo and the others, and said, “The rest of you step down first.”

“Master!” Ling Huo and the rest exclaimed in defiance. They, too, wanted a battle, but should Ling Han move, they would definitely have no opportunity for a fight.

Ling Han chucked. “It’s all right. In the future, there will be more than enough battles for you. Now, we don’t have the time to waste on a few minor characters.”

“What did you say?” When Li Hongfei and the others heard Ling Han’s words, they all looked furious.

He actually dared to call them minor characters?

Though they weren’t the most outstanding generation of Clear Heaven Pass, all of them had come from great clans, and their status could be considered lofty and noble, and now they were actually looked down on as minor characters, which naturally pissed them off.

“We’ll capture him first.”

“That’s right. He seems to be the leader of these cowards.”

“To defeat the enemy, the chief must be captured first, and it would also be more fulfilling to beat up the leader.”

The 19 of them moved at the same time, wanting to use their united power to capture Ling Han in a single stroke..
