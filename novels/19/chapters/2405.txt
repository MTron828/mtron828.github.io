Chapter 2406: Rage of the Qin Clan

After Ling Han taught for a while, he let Wally take the stage. On the matter of the power of heaven and earth, it was definitely Wally that was more knowledgeable.

Wally was also very interested in Little Terror. After all, a creation of heaven and earth was rare. He did not mind teaching while he himself studied it.

Ling Han sat at the side, and he heard the sound of a hand slamming a table after just a short while. He slowly moved to the conference room. As expected, the envoy from the Qin Clan bore an indignant expression as he slammed his hand repeatedly on the table.

“….Fine, we gave you face, but since you don’t want it, just wait to be destroyed!”

A total of two people came from the Qin Clan, and the speaker at present was a middle-aged man in his thirties. He was a First Severance, while the other was a young man in his twenties. The latter was sipping tea, looking completely calm and relaxed.

When the middle-aged man finished his words, the young man put his teacup down, and coughed lightly.

“Young Master An, please!” The middle-aged man hurriedly leaned down, as if he was a servant, expressing goodwill to that young man.

Only then did the young man say, “You all should consider carefully. Do you truly wish to reject the magnanimous offer of our Qin Clan?”

“Hey, hey, hey. Young Master An has already spoken. Have you considered carefully? Don’t just decide spontaneously!” The middle-aged man immediately used Young Master An as an intimidation tactic as he pointed at them one after another, looking absolutely like a vile character.

“This is our final decision,” Feng Po Yun stated evenly. In the past, he had been a top-tier elite in the small world, so he naturally had his moral integrity and graceful bearing. This was something that a great many people who were stronger than him could not possess.

Thus there was the saying: “better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.”

“You are all a bunch of idiots!” the middle-aged man shouted, wanting nothing more than to run over and strangle them.

Meanwhile, the young man merely smiled. “I really would like to see why you people have so much confidence!”

He stretched out a hand to grab Feng Po Yun. The latter was the strongest elite in here, a Fourth Severance. As long as he could take Feng Po Yun down, he would naturally destroy the confidence of everyone here.

Feng Po Yun humphed lightly, and moved to greet the blow.

His natural talent was far from those of Ling Han and the Rain Emperor, but in the past, he had been able to become a Shattering Void Tier even in the barren Lower Realm, so he could still be considered a naturally gifted extraordinary genius. However, because the Celestial Realm was too big, and there were too many geniuses, he was now nothing out of the ordinary.

But his battle prowess was considerably strong as well. Furthermore, Ling Han had rushed to improve his battle prowess these last few days. Anything that could be used was used, such as Ancestral King blood, high-grade alchemical pills, and so on, and added with time acceleration effects, the increase to his battle prowess was very astonishing.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two clashed, instantly destroying the great hall, and then brought their battle to the skies.

“Hehe, now that Young Master An has moved, that person will definitely lose his life.” The middle-aged man gave a wisecrack.

Young Master An, one of the well-known figures of the younger generation of the Qin Clan, who was only just a step away from the Dividing Soul Tier. It would not take too long before he would set out to complete his breakthrough.

Yet none of those gathered panicked. Even if Feng Po Yun was no match, didn’t they still have Ling Han?

However, in the air, Qin An was getting more and more anxious as he fought.

He actually had not managed to take his opponent down?

This had far surpassed his expectations because he had expected that he would be able to grasp the upper hand completely in 100 moves, at most, and would be able to build an absolute advantage within 500 moves, yet 200-300 moves had already been exchanged now, and not only had he not gotten the upper hand, he was being suppressed instead.

He could not accept this. As an outstanding descendant of the noble Qin Clan, he was actually unable to suppress an unorthodox cultivator?

Meanwhile, Feng Po Yun was more and more pleased as he fought. Originally, he had not possessed such strong battle prowess. This was all benefits from the rushed improvement that Ling Han had helped him with, allowing his battle prowess to double!

At the beginning, he was still unable to adapt to such powerful strength, but after fighting for a long time, he became proficient, completely suppressing Qin An.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Light flashed endlessly in the skies as thunderous booms rang out without stopping.

After half a day later, a figure suddenly descended from the skies.

The middle-aged man immediately laughed loudly. “Hahahaha, Young Master An has won— yi, Young Master An? Young Master An!” After laughing for a while, he only then realized that the person that had dropped down was actually Qin An. Hurriedly, he raced over, and helped Qin An to his feet.

Feng Po Yun flew down onto the ground. His confidence soared, feeling like he had returned to the small world, where even though the world was huge, he could still act freely and without restraint.

“Scram!” Feng Po Yun rebuked.

“You dare tell us to scram?” The middle-aged man felt disbelief. It should be known that the Qin Clan had Dividing Soul Tier elites. ‘So what if you have defeated Qin An? The Qin Clan has a lot of other people that can still restrain you.’

Yet Qin An felt that he was shamed, and stopped the admonishment from that middle-aged man. He menacingly declared, “So it turns out that there are many hidden talents in Coiled Clouds Mountains. Fine, I will admit defeat this time round!”

He pushed the middle-aged man aside, planning to walk on his own power.

“Young Master An! Young Master An!” The middle-aged man hurriedly followed after him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, he had just taken a step when he realized a man was blocking his way. Involuntarily, he was angered, and shouted, “Get out of the way!”

Ling Han smiled slightly. “Your mouth is too smelly. I don’t think you would remember if you were not taught a lesson!” With a wave of his hand,?pa, a slap landed immediately, causing the middle-aged man to turn around a few circles on the spot, spitting out a spray of blood as well as over a dozen broken teeth.

“Ah!” The middle-aged man yowled, and after finally managing to steady himself, he looked at Ling Han, and demanded, “You, you dare to strike me?”

Ling Han was surprised. “You haven’t learnt the lesson yet?”

The middle-aged man hurriedly chased after Qin An. He felt absolute fear of Ling Han. The latter had been able to smack him into an idiot with a single strike; there was absolutely no chance he would be Ling Han’s match.

Meanwhile, Qin An cast a second look at Ling Han and Feng Po Yun, and then left without another look backwards.

He would definitely be back.

Ling Han made no move to stop him. In any case, he would be staying here for a while, so the Qin Clan could be just something to help him while away the time.

The reaction of the Qin Clan was considerably faster and considerably more intense this time round.

A mere Severing Mundane Tier force had not just refused their “generous offer,” but had actually wounded their envoy as well?

A day later, the Qin Clan sent out a great number of troops, with two Dividing Soul Tier elites leading, outfitted with 11 Severing Mundane Tiers, and added with a certain number of Genesis Tiers. This team could be considered grand.

“Young Master Yun, sorry that you have to see this embarrassment.” Among this group from the Qin Clan, there was an outsider as well, but if Ling Han had spotted him, he would definitely have been able to recognize him with a single look.

Fu Gaoyun, descendant of the main line of the Fu Clan, the chief authority in Separation Resentment City, as well as the heir of the clan—previously, he had been one of the heirs, but now he was the only heir.

Hence, the Qin Clan naturally treated Fu Gaoyun with extreme respect.

Meanwhile, Fu Gaoyun paid them no regard. It just so happened that he had received an invitation to visit the Qin Clan, yet coincidentally encountered this matter. On a whim, he thus decided to come and take a look since he was free anyways.

…He was indeed quite bored. As the noble heir of the Fu Clan, he was actually still so sloppy.

After so many years, his cultivation level had still increased greatly, reaching the Earth Soul Tier, which was extremely impressive.

The entire group was aggressive as they charged into the town.

They were too strong, their arrogance soaring. All the traders in town found some place to hide, fearing that they would be drawn into the strife.

“Who is the person in charge here? Get out here!” a Dividing Soul Tier of the Qin Clan shouted loudly.

Feng Po Yun, Murong Qing, and Ling Han walked out together. Suddenly, Fu Gaoyun’s eyes widened. He rubbed his eyes, as if he had seen a ghost.
