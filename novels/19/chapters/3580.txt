Chapter 3581: A set of celestial techniques

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xiao Zhixuan was filled with extreme regret.

She hadn’t come from the prison, but came from a martial arts clan whose abilities weren’t all that strong. After she ate a Treasured Fruit, her cultivation level soared to the Mystery Realm Tier.

This kind of cultivation level that she had obtained naturally meant that her battle prowess was not strong. She also knew this fact. Thus, the reason why she had come here to participate in the martial arts tournament was to choose a super genius to be her ideal husband.

—She was filled with confidence in her own appearance.

She deliberately put on an aloof attitude, just to raise her own image, and she also knew that the more aloof she appeared, the more she would attract men.

If she was too easily attained, men would not cherish her.

After her previous observations, she was most interested in the mysterious Ling Han, and disliked the boastful Niu Jianhua the most. However, after seeing Niu Jianhua’s domineering performance, she naturally had a whole new respect for Niu Jianhua, and felt that she had misjudged him. She had actually seen the dragon as an insect, and the insect as a dragon.

But just when she took the initiative to speak with Niu Jianhua, and deliberately distanced herself from Ling Han, a dramatic scene appeared.

Niu Jianhua fled, and Ling Han, who had turned from a dragon into an insect, showed signs of being a dragon again.

This was really a great turn of events, which also made her extremely depressed.

If she tried to worm her way into Ling Han’s good books now, would Ling Han forget the scene of her talking intimately with Niu Jianhua?

She was secretly resentful. Why were all of you so low-key, insisting on putting on a pretence? In the end, all right, she had been screwed over!

■Both of you deserve to be struck by lightning.’

Ling Han didn’t care about what Xiao Zhixuan was thinking. He was extremely aggressive, and his attacks were fierce. At this moment, he didn’t need to activate his eye technique any more. In his eyes, Liu Huayun’s sword technique was nothing at all. He could easily see through it and attack its core.

The Misty Rain Sword was indeed slightly more skilled in defense, but there was no such thing as the strongest defense in this world. Under Ling Han’s mad barrage of attacks, Lu Huayun gradually showed signs of exhaustion.

“Yi, isn’t that Liu Huayun?”

“Liu Huayun, one of the top ten in Mystery Realm Tier?

“He is actually outmatched?”

“Could it be that his opponent is another of the top ten?”

“By the looks of it, it looks a little like Wang Dong, who is ranked eighth.” “En, it should be Wang Dong. Otherwise, how could Liu Huayun have possibly fallen into a disadvantage.”

A group of people just happened to pass by, and when they saw such a great battle, they naturally paled. A battle of this level should have only happened in the actual tournament, yet now, they had clashed ahead of time, which made them stop and watch, even though they clearly knew that it was dangerous to stay here.

Xiao Zhixuan naturally heard him very clearly, and couldn’t help but complain internally. That wasn’t that Wang Dong, but a king of pretentiousness!

After a few more moves, Ling Han that he could not possibly have the slightest chance of winning, and strictly speaking, his younger brother had been wounded by Niu Jianhua. He did not have any deep enmity with Ling Han, so there was no need for him to be so desperate. Wasn’t this just letting Niu Jianhua be smug for nothing?

With this in mind, he hurriedly turned around and left. Where there was life, there would be hope. When he met Ling Han again in the actual tournament, he would just use his ultimate move. This trump card naturally had to be left for the most crucial moment.

Ling Han shot out a burst of energy, which landed on Liu Huayun’s behind. As the pieces of cloth flew, he was instantly completely exposed.

The spectators nearby were all dumbfounded.

…Liu Huayun was actually running naked?

This was definitely big news, and the one who had caused Liu Huayun to run naked was another young prodigy, Wang Dong. Putting aside the matter itself, merely thinking about the story hidden behind it was enough to make one’s imagination run wild.

This was really filled with g@yness.

Ling Han withdrew his fist, and looked towards those people in the vicinity. Instantly, these people fled in fright.

Sigh, what were they running for? He was not a tiger. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Brother Can Ye, you really have hidden depths!” Xiao Zhixuan said slowly, seeming both plaintive and aggrieved, causing one’s heart to beat wildly.

She was still making her final efforts. What if Ling Han liked this type? Ling Han smiled faintly. He naturally would not take Xiao Zhixuan to heart, and was just about to speak, when a voice suddenly rang out. “Somewhere at the summit, there is a technique called the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle. It is a Celestial level secret technique, and Elder Guo had deliberately placed it there. Whoever can find this technique would be able to directly obtain a place in the round of 32.”

His voice boomed, spreading to every corner of the mountain.

This was a Celestial Path elite.

After Ling Han heard this, he couldn’t help but feel a rush of excitement. He didn’t care about qualifying for the top 32 ahead of time. In any case, he would definitely win, but a Celestial level technique was a different story.

Right now, there were pitifully few techniques that he could use. If he could obtain this claw technique, he would be able to unleash its full might in the upcoming competition.

-As for whether he would be able to learn this technique in one or two days, he naturally did not have the slightest doubt.

He was filled with confidence in himself.

This voice could be heard by everyone. Obviously, a great many people would definitely rush towards the summit, and begin fighting over it.

This was a Celestial level technique!

And for mediocre people, if they were lucky enough to obtain this secret technique, wouldn’t they immediately be able to stand out from the rest?

Thus, they were also willing to take the risk.

Instantly, at least 80% of those who had not withdrawn from the tournament leaped towards the summit.

Ling Han didn’t waste any time. He turned around and left, leaving Xiao Zhixuan where she was.

To him, there was no relation between the two of them. They had only been staying in the same courtyard previously.

They had just been staying in the same courtyard, not the same room, or sleeping on the same bed, so was there any need for him to take responsibility for her?

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhixuan sighed. Obviously, she could not possibly cling onto Ling Han, but what about Niu Jianhua?

But when she thought about how Niu Jianhua had directly abandoned her at the most crucial moment, cold-blooded and heartless, it was clear that he was narrow-minded by nature. This kind of person only had eyes for himself, and if she followed Niu Jianhua, who knew when she would be sacrificed.

The more she thought about it, the more numb she felt.

This mountain was not too tall, and was only a few thousand meters tall. Compared to the majestic peaks that were so easily tens of thousands of meters tall, this was really a junior.

Ling Han wasn’t walking very fast. After all, this was a mountain path, so he couldn’t use his movement techniques. However, it only took him two minutes to arrive at the summit.

Dozens of people had already arrived, and an intense battle was presently taking place.

Some people were extremely powerful, and they could kill their enemies with a single strike. Meanwhile, some people were extremely ordinary, and they belonged to the category of people who had been insta-killed with a single strike. The gulf between them was extremely clear.

A celestial technique had gathered prodigies and mediocre people together. Under the intense battle, mediocre people were naturally quickly eliminated. -The Primordial Sect suddenly said that there was a celestial technique hidden here, obviously wanting them to kill each other faster.

“Brat, have you come to your death?” A man grinned, brandishing a bloody broadsword as he slashed over. He had already killed five people, and had also become excited from the killing. When he saw a young man who looked to be in his twenties suddenly appear, he charged over at the first instant.

Shua, just when the blade was about to slash onto Ling Han’s neck, he couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation. That scene of his head flying and blood gushing like a fountain would make him incredibly excited..
