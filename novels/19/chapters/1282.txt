1283 Whose Sword is Stronger

Ling Han threw both of his fists, and they were like two mountains as they bore down on Zhang Heng.

Boom!

A devastating aura swept forth before Ling Han’s fists had even arrived. The space around them collapsed, and the stars and clouds in the sky all lost their luster.

The disciples of the Five Sects fled in disarray. Not to mention those at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, even those at the medium extreme and high extreme didn’t dare to face Ling Han’s iron fists head-on. Simply being scraped by them would be enough to wound them severely.

Ling Han’s physique was as tough as Level Seven Godly metal, perhaps even stronger. Moreover, the battle right now was completely playing to his strengths and maximizing his advantages.

His iron fists arrived before Zhang Heng.

However, Zhang Heng was unfazed as he slashed his sword toward the sky.

Shua!

A burst of Sword Qi sliced through the air and slashed into the two mountain-like fists.

Weng!

Surprisingly, Ling Han’s fists were sent reeling back.

‘Strong!’

In terms of power, he was clearly no match for Zhang Heng. After all, Zhang Heng’s cultivation level was far higher than his. Not only that, but he was also a four-star genius. Thus, Ling Han’s power of six-stars was only equivalent to a two-star advantage. However, a mere two stars weren’t enough to overcome the difference in cultivation level between them.

“10,000 years ago, you couldn’t even withstand a single strike of mine. Now, 10,000 years later... you’re still no match for me!” Zhang Heng said arrogantly. He advanced with his sword.

He hadn’t taken the path of becoming one with his weapon. First of all, he still had yet to reach the consummate level. Second of all, he had lofty ambitions, and he wasn’t content with being at the Sun Moon Tier. He wanted to become an Eternal River Tier elite. Thus, he naturally wouldn’t fuse his Suns and Moons into his God Tool and sever his own path of cultivation.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I thought you were going to say that I still couldn’t withstand a single strike of yours.”

“If this is all you’ve got, I’ll chop your head off in less than 10 exchanges!” Zhang Heng slashed at Ling Han, and it was as if the might of heaven and earth was also circulating with his sword.

Ling Han nodded inwardly. In terms of Sword Dao alone, Zhang Heng was indeed worthy of being called the Sword Emperor. He was very, very powerful.

However, Ling Han wasn’t weak, either! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ling Han transformed his fists into fingers.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

He continued to snap his fingers, and bursts of vicious Sword Qi shot toward Zhang Heng.

This was the Lightning Sword Technique.

Although he hadn’t achieved Great Accomplishment in the Lightning Sword Technique yet, he had most likely reached Small Accomplishment already. His technique contained speed and destructiveness, and it was also in harmony with the might of the great dao. It even contained a wisp of heaven’s might.

Even if he didn’t unleash this technique with his Divine Demon Sword, it would still be as powerful as the strike of a True Dragon. It was filled with a domineering aura that yearned to crush the world.

Zhang Heng couldn’t help but feel surprised. He was a sword-wielder as well, and he had devoted his entire life to the sword—he had an incredible obsession with the Sword Dao. Although Ling Han had formed swords by merely snapping his fingers just then, his strikes had made him feel a profound sword intent.

This sword intent... was far above his comprehension!

He was completely stunned. Although he had given up his title of Sword Emperor, he was still an extremely proud individual. He believed that he was simply limited by his cultivation level. If he were to battle others on an equal footing, he was confident that he could use his sword to defeat any Heavenly Body Tier elite or Eternal River Tier elite.

However, his confidence was shattered by Ling Han’s ferocious sword intent.

This person—who he had deemed unworthy of being his opponent in the past—had actually surpassed him in the Sword Dao?

He refused to accept this!

Zhang Heng roared as he unleashed the full power of his Sword Dao. Sword Qi burst into the air, transforming into countless black blades that slashed at Ling Han. They were as dense as a dark cloud.

Ling Han was fearless as he faced this attack head-on.

The members of the Five Sects watched on in utter shock. Most of them had never seen Ling Han before, and they had only heard of his terrible deeds. Right now, they couldn’t help but feel stunned with his ability to hold his own against Zhang Heng. This was absolutely incredible.

Although Zhang Heng was only at the high extreme, his battle prowess had already soared to the consummate level. In fact, even many senior elites were no match for him. He was known as the strongest rising star of the Heaven’s Sword Palace, and he enjoyed an equally great reputation with the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden.

However... Ling Han’s strength was only on the same level as Zhang Heng. So, why did the Five Sects treat him with such caution? Why had they deployed all of their elites to deal with just a single person?

Just look at the scenes before them—it was clear that Zhang Heng was enjoying an advantage over him. If this fight continued, the loser would definitely be Ling Han!

Just Zhang Heng alone was enough to deal with him. So, why were the Five Sects making so much fuss?

However, Zhang Heng knew otherwise. He was indeed enjoying an advantage over Ling Han, but this was only because he possessed a higher cultivation level. In terms of Sword Dao alone, he had already lost.

‘How can such a profound sword technique exist? How can it combine speed and power so seamlessly?’

There was an unbearable itch in his heart. As someone who was obsessed with the sword, he was willing to pay any price to learn the profound secret of Ling Han’s sword technique.

“Enough! Since this is the limit of that brat’s abilities, let’s attack together and kill him!” This was an elder who had been observing the battle from the sidelines. After observing for a long time, he had concluded that this was the limit of Ling Han’s strength. This made him feel much more at ease.

In any case, they weren’t here to battle Ling Han one-on-one. They were here to kill this demon who might shake the Five Sects’ foundations in the future.

Several consummate level elites stepped forward. They knew that Ling Han possessed huge secrets, and this was an opportunity to help the Five Sects soar into the sky. If they obtained his secrets, perhaps they could advance to the Heavenly Body Tier or even the Eternal River Tier.

“Fall back!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shouted.

Boom!

The projection of two phoenix wings that measured almost 500 meters each unfurled from her back. However, they burned with real flames, and this further highlighted her breathtaking beauty. She was like a stunningly beautiful war goddess.

“Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, are you really going to betray us?” several elders chided. They were so infuriated that they were almost about to vomit blood.

In their minds, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was only as powerful as she was thanks to the help of the Five Sects. However, not only was she not repaying the Five Sects, but she was even helping their biggest enemy!

This was despicable to the extreme.

“If you take another step, I’ll consider you my enemy!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said menacingly. She had barely received any benefits from the Cloud Phoenix Sect. In any case, she completely loathed Realm Pills.

It was because her bloodline had awakened that she was able to advance to the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier in such a short amount of time!

The elders exchanged a glance before nodding in tacit understanding. They definitely, definitely couldn’t let Ling Han escape. What would they do if he went into hiding and reappeared after tens of thousands of years?

With his freakish talents, he would be able to crush the Five Sects once he reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

“Elder Yu, Elder Qian, you two hold the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden back. Everyone else, follow me and capture that brat!”

“Understood!”

The elders immediately launched into action.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was infuriated, and balls of flames curled through the air as she flapped her wings, releasing a formidable might. She was only at the consummate level, but her bloodline meant that these flames possessed a wisp of the True Phoenix’s devastating might. Thus, these flames were naturally terrifying.

This was a suppression from a superior level. The elders groaned at the same time, a pained expression spreading across their faces.

They were completely speechless. Against someone with a stronger bloodline, they were at a disadvantage before they had even started fighting.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden lashed out with her palm as she dashed forward. There was the cry of a phoenix, and a multi-colored phoenix suddenly materialized in the air and swooped toward the members of the Five Sects. This phoenix was enveloped in divine flames.

“Charge!” the members of the Five Sects roared. Since the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden refused to see reason, they would simply kill her alongside Ling Han!
