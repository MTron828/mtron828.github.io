The old ginseng was just about to act all perverted, yet he suddenly felt his body tighten. He had already been captured by Hu Niu. He looked up, only to see that this beautiful girl was suddenly wearing an uncouth expression. Her dainty mouth was slightly open, and drool was flowing freely from her mouth.

“Look, Ling Han, I caught an old ginseng king!” Hu Niu was still a little glutton. She wiped the drool from her mouth as she looked around, and said, “Huh? Where’s the pot? Hurry up and set up a pot! Niu is going to make this old ginseng king into stew!”

“Save me!” the old ginseng wailed. Why didn’t this girl play by the rules?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “This old ginseng is still useful. Let him go for now.”

“Oh.” Hu Niu nodded in disappointment. However, she immediately started to bargain, saying, “Then I’ll only eat half. Is that okay?”

“No!” the old ginseng hurriedly shouted. What kind of person was she? Couldn’t she see that he had already developed intelligence and become a ginseng king? She should be kneeling and kowtowing before him!

Hu Niu naturally ignored him. She looked at Ling Han with big and hopeful eyes.

Ling Han laughed loudly before turning to the old ginseng and saying, “You’ve come across a glutton, so it’s impossible for you to remain unscathed. I suggest you donate a few of your roots. Otherwise, this glutton will never let you go.”

The old ginseng had no option but to begrudgingly pluck a few of his roots and hand them to Ling Han. Ling Han chucked them into a pot and added an abundant amount of Demonic Beast meat and Godly medicine. This was an extremely nutritious pot of soup.

“So fragrant!” Although Hu Niu was already a Genesis Tier Saint, her love for food still remained unchanged. She ran around and jumped up and down as Ling Han cooked. Which part of her seemed like a Genesis Tier Saint? She was more like a lively monkey.

When Ling Han told them that Hu Niu had become a Saint, they almost fainted in shock.

In the Immortal Realm, becoming a Saint marked the end of the cultivation journey. Saints were the most powerful beings in the world. However, Hu Niu had reached the Genesis Tier in just a mere few years. How could they accept this?

In any case, Ling Han wouldn’t lie to them.

Although they ate meat and drank soup together, they all felt like they were in a dream. Everything seemed hazy and unreal.

In the following three days, Hu Niu stuck with Ling Han everywhere. She racked her brains for methods to escape with Ling Han, though the old woman in cyan would appear whenever she attempted to escape. She would thwart Hu Niu’s attempts and stop her from mucking around.

“Rest assured. Although I don’t know where the Celestial Realm is, and although I don’t know what kind of place it is, I’ll definitely go there one day!” Ling Han said resolutely. He would go not just for Hu Niu, but also for his parents, son, and lovers.

“Niu believes you!” Hu Niu nodded, and said, “I’ll patiently wait for a few more centuries. Ling Han, you can definitely make it into the Celestial Realm!”

She glanced around for a moment before saying, “Niu will tell you some secrets!”

Although Hu Niu liked to muck around, she was still aware of what was important and what was not. She told Ling Han some cultivation secrets, and she also modified the Cloud Piercing Shuttle for him, making it far more capable of traveling through the galaxy. Her modifications also allowed the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to house a star chart formation.

This was an extremely easy task for Genesis Tier Saints. After all, they could already create entire worlds!

During these three days, Ling Han tried his best to absorb the information that Hu Niu told him. There wasn’t long before they had to separate again.

On the fourth day, the old woman in cyan appeared and dragged the wailing Hu Niu away. She took a step and vanished into heaven and earth. Of course, at Hu Niu’s strong request, the bewitching Shui Yanyu was also taken away.

This girl... was extremely prone to becoming jealous. If Hu Feiyun hadn’t still been in the Black Tower, she would have definitely been taken away as well.

Ling Han inhaled the lingering fragrance of Hu Niu. It was as if he were in a dream.

Hu Niu’s appearance had affected him immensely.

He immediately entered the Black Tower to visit Notionless Saint.

“Senior, are there any tiers above the Genesis Tier?” he asked.

“Impossible!” the Notionless Saint answered. “The Genesis Tier is the conclusion of the cultivation path. It’s impossible to advance another step!”

“Then... has Senior ever heard of the Celestial Realm before?” Ling Han asked.

“Celestial Realm?” Notionless Saint murmured. If he still possessed a physical body, he would definitely be wearing an expression of confusion at this moment.

“Sigh!” Small Tower appeared, and said, “I hadn’t wanted to tell you so soon. However, since you already know bits and pieces, I may as well tell you more. Otherwise, you’ll simply feel uneasy.”

“You know about it?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

Small Tower ignored him, and said, “There are naturally more tiers above the Genesis Tier. Meanwhile, the Celestial Realm... is where these people reside.”

“Impossible!” Notionless Saint exclaimed in shock.

“Where exactly is this Celestial Realm?” Ling Han asked. He had come from a small world, so he could easily accept the fact that there was a higher transcendent realm above the Immortal Realm. After all, wasn’t the Immortal Realm transcendent above the small worlds?

The Small Tower remained calm, and replied, “Only when you reach the peak stage of the Genesis Tier and grasp both the power of construction and power of destruction will you be able to open the passageway to the Celestial Realm. Otherwise, you’ll never be able to find it.”

Both the power of construction and power of destruction?

Ling Han’s heart jolted. ‘Saints possess the power of construction, while Demon Masters possess the power of destruction. I have to grasp both the Regulations of the Immortal Realm and the Regulations of the Netherworld before I can enter the Celestial Realm?’

“Is this a transcendent realm?” Ling Han asked.

“No, the Celestial Realm is a part of the Immortal Realm. It’s just that it’s been sealed,” Small Tower replied.

Meanwhile, Notionless Saint was transfixed with shock. Although he had once been a Saint, his head still went numb when he learned of this reality—oh, that’s right, he didn’t have a head anymore. Anyhow, he was absolutely stunned.

“It’s been sealed? By whom? Why did they seal it?” Ling Han pressed for more information.

“Only a tiny bit of my memory has returned, so it’s pointless for you to ask so much.” Small Tower didn’t have an answer for him this time. It continued, “Raise your cultivation level and grasp both the power of construction and power of destruction. When you succeed, you’ll naturally be able to enter the Celestial Realm to look for answers”

Ling Han nodded slowly. A great sense of urgency gripped at his mind.

It was clear that both the Black Tower and the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll were from the Celestial Realm. Otherwise, the ability of the Black Tower would be far too astonishing. It could accelerate the growth of Godly medicines, and it could also become as good as invisible. The Black Tower itself was also immune to all techniques and attacks.

This was because the Black Tower had been forged by Regulations that were transcendent above the Immortal Realm.

That being the case, the original owner of the Black Tower had definitely been wounded or killed by someone in the Celestial Realm. This towering enemy... was waiting for him in the Celestial Realm.

It seemed like he was advancing in leaps and bounds, yet the appearance of Hu Niu told him that it was extremely, extremely easy to reach the Genesis Tier in the Celestial Realm.

Of course, the Roc Palace was a supremely powerful sect. Members of ordinary sects most likely weren’t as frightening as Hu Niu. Moreover, Hu Niu had been a peerless elite in her past life, and this was part of the reason behind her terrifying advancement pace.

However, he could still imagine the countless number of super-geniuses in the Celestial Realm. There were probably even more elites.

Meanwhile, it was possible that he was going to compete against the prodigies of the Celestial Realm soon. Eventually, he would even have to battle against the Celestial Realm elites!

This would be extremely fun, no?

Ling Han’s blood boiled in excitement, and his fighting spirit soared through the sky.
