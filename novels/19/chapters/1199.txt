Chapter 1200: Analysis

Ling Han generally stayed in the Black Tower and cultivated under the Reincarnation Tree, so he was naturally unaware of the huge commotion outside. It was only when he prepared to go to the Mo Clan Establishment to collect some pills and pay his debt that he was stopped by Shui Yanyu and informed of the situation.

“Them again?” Ling Han said, a cold look in his eyes.

This was the same as what had happened at the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. Zhao Lun had lodged a false accusation against him, and he had been put on a public trial by the army. Fortunately, the empress had issued a decree that exonerated him. In fact, she had even seized the opportunity to execute a bunch of corrupt officials.

However, due to the sensitivity of Zhao Lun’s status, even the empress hadn’t dealt with him.

This was partly because the matter hadn’t been too serious. Moreover, there hadn’t been a relationship between Ling Han and the empress at that time. If such an event were to occur now, the empress would probably deal with Zhao Lun swiftly and mercilessly.

If Great General Zhao dared to oppose her, she would execute him along with his son!

It wasn’t as if she hadn’t executed Heavenly Body Tier generals before.

However, this was the Majestic Heaven Sect, and the empress’ influence couldn’t reach this far. Even if she came over to help Ling Han, there was still a mountain-esque Eternal River Tier elite keeping watch over the sect.

Who in this galaxy could challenge an Eternal River Tier elite?

Ling Han humphed, and said, “They’re twisting the truth and completely fabricating stories. How shameless!”

He had obtained the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid himself, and this was a fact that many people knew. Regarding the people from the Gao Faction, it was Shi Ming who had chosen to unleash power at the Sun Moon Tier. However, his action had led to him being attacked and killed by the restriction of the mystery realm.

Meanwhile, the other members of the group had been killed by the rain of blood and bones that had formed when Shi Ming exploded and died. He hadn’t laid a single finger on them.

Yet, they had put all of these deaths on his head?

“Gao Huang... is such a shameless person!” There was a cold glint in Ling Han’s eyes. He had come across shameless people before, yet he had never come across someone as shameless and flagrant as Gao Huang. He had forcefully twisted the truth to fit his own narrative.

“Right now, the problem is that everyone in the sect is talking about how you massacred fellow disciples and stole their Thousand Source True Fluid,” Shui Yanyu said anxiously.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “There’s no need to worry about the matter regarding the Thousand Source True Fluid. A great deal of people witnessed me obtaining it. Anyhow, who’s willing to believe that the Gao Faction can obtain four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid all by themselves?”

“Mm-hm!” Shui Yanyu nodded in realization. She had been extremely worried, so she hadn’t been able to analyze the situation as calmly and clearly as Ling Han.

“The more pressing issue is the death of Shi Ming and the others.” Ling Han rubbed his chin, and continued, “After all, no one witnessed that battle. Even if someone did witness it, it’s extremely likely that they’re not a disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect. Thus, it’s even more unlikely that they’ll step forward to act as a witness for me.”

This was a vast galaxy with billions upon billions of people, so where would they find a witness—if there was even one? Moreover, witnesses could be bought off. In terms of wealth, Ling Han was definitely no match for the entire Gao Faction that had the support of a Heavenly Body Tier elite.

Although Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun had also witnessed the battle, they had extremely close relationships with Ling Han. Thus, even if they offered witness statements, they would merely be dismissed as biased toward Ling Han.

“Anyhow, being as shameless as Gao Huang is, he’ll probably find a few people to pose as witnesses. They’ll claim that they personally saw me killing those Gao Faction members.” Ling Han speculated what kinds of methods Gao Huang might use.

“What can we do?” Shui Yanyu asked anxiously. This was the Majestic Heaven Sect, so the Gao Faction was definitely very influential.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Even the Gao Faction can’t shut out the heavens with one hand. This is the Majestic Heaven Sect, after all, not the Gao Faction! However, whether or not this matter can be resolved depends on whether the other eight factions are willing to weigh in on it. It also depends on Venerable Trinity’s attitude.”

Shui Yanyu composed herself, and also started to analyze the situation, saying, “Venerable Trinity has nine disciples in total, and each has their own faction. Out of the other eight factions, there are definitely a few that are hostile to the Gao Faction. We don’t need all of them, and we’ll be able to resist the Gao Faction if just one of them is willing to help.”

“Correct. However, why should they help us? What’s in it for them?” Ling Han smiled, and said, “They’re not my wives, so they’re not always thinking about what’s in my best interests.”

He pulled Shui Yanyu into an embrace. He had been busy with cultivation and comprehension these past few days, so he hadn’t had a chance to “show love” to this bewitching beauty. Now that her soft and shapely body was pressed against him, he couldn’t help but feel aroused.

Shui Yanyu felt a little annoyed, and she naturally blamed Ling Han for being so “heartless”—he had ignored her for an entire fortnight. However, he had actually become aroused at this moment. She truly didn’t know what to say.

“Come, it’s only right that we discuss important matters in bed!”

After some passionate love-making, Ling Han embraced Shui Yanyu in satisfaction, and said, “Everyone knows that I obtained a few drops of Thousand Source True Fluid. If I want to seek help from any of the other factions, they’ll probably ask for Thousand Source True Fluid in return.”

Shui Yanyu nodded, and said, “Gao Huang is probably trying to force you into submission as well. He wants you to willingly hand him the Thousand Source True Fluid.”

“Mm-hm. Even though I’ve got yet to meet him, his actions reveal that he’s a cold-blooded person. He doesn’t give a toss about his subordinates’ lives, as long as they can fulfill his goals.” Ling Han humphed, and said, “Right now, he’s stuck at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. If he doesn’t obtain any Thousand Source True Fluid, he might need over a million years to reach the Heavenly Body Tier. In fact, there’s a possibility that he’ll be stuck at the Sun Moon Tier forever.”

“So, he’ll definitely do everything he can to snatch your Thousand Source True Fluid!” Shui Yanyu exclaimed in astonishment.

Ling Han chuckled coldly, and said, “He’s truly a wild dog. I’ll need to up my guard, or it really will be troublesome if I’m bitten by him.”

“Can’t he wait for next time?” Shui Yanyu asked in irritation.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “How can a despicable person like him keep his calm after seeing four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid placed in front of him? Moreover, even though I’m a seed, I’ve come to the Immortal Realm from a small world. In other words, I’m the easiest to pick on.”

The other five king tiers had each obtained a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid as well, meaning Gao Huang would be able to obtain another five drops if he were able to force all of them to give their drop up. This would be more than what Ling Han had.

Nine drops of Thousand Source True Fluid was better than four, right? It would definitely increase his chance of breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier. So, why didn’t he target Shen Zhu’er and the others? This was because their background was too powerful. Gao Huang was merely afraid of offending them.

“But doesn’t the empress... hold you in high regard?” Shui Yanyu asked. She struggled to come up with words to describe their relationship. The relationship between Ling Han and the empress was very fuzzy, after all.

“Heh, although the empress helped me before, everyone thought that she had left a spiritual mark on the Ninth King’s body. They thought that the Ninth King had asked her for help,” Ling Han said.

This made a world of difference. If the Heavenly Body Tier elite didn’t want to help Ling Han, Gao Huang would only have to face the Ninth King. If that were the case, what would he need to be afraid of? Even if they did want to help, they would both have Heavenly Body Tier elites supporting them. Moreover, it was clear that Gao Fang—who had an Eternal River Tier master—was more impressive.

“So you’re saying that we have to deal with this ourselves?” Shui Yanyu asked uneasily.

“Mm-hm!” Ling Han nodded, and then said, “Don’t worry, if they truly piss me off, I’ll chuck Notionless Saint out. Although he’s lost his saintly might, he was once a Saint, after all. Using him to frighten people should be fine.”

Shui Yanyu nodded and finally felt a little more at ease.

However, Ling Han knew that he wouldn’t be able to use Notionless Saint. He had already refined his own saintly might for his future disciple, so how could he deter Eternal River Tier elites? In fact, could he even deter Heavenly Body Tier elites?

He had only said this to reassure Shui Yanyu.
