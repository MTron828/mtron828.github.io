Chapter 1829: Prostration

Ling Han used Lightning Flash. His speed was similarly astonishing, and he pursued Luo Changfeng closely.

Both of them moved as fast as lightning. With a crackle, blazing white lightning flashed, the sight astonishing.

“Banish!” Ling Han stretched out his right hand, and pressed it down on Luo Changfeng.

Luo Changfeng suddenly felt a coldness that caused his hair to stand on end. He gritted his teeth, and zi, the flash of lightning on his body actually quickly became slightly stronger than before, and he attained another burst of speed, increasing slightly in an inconceivable maner, and he was actually faster than this strike from Ling Han.

Banish instantly hit empty air.

Ling Han also appeared slightly surprised. This Natural Lightning Physique was really quite amazing. Even with that, Luo Changfeng still managed to dodge? Before this, only that mutated Celestial medicine had been able to do so, and that was because that thing had grown through absorbing Lightning Regulations.

‘Let me give it a try too!’

As Ling Han pursued, the Lightning Regulations that he had obtained through absorbing the Celestial medicine surged in his heart.

Before this, he had only used Celestial medicines to interweave and form a resonance with the heaven and earth, and rapidly comprehend Dao through that, allowing himself to push open the doors to the third severance. He had not managed to refine the two types of Regulations that were contained in the Celestial medicine itself.

He still had some time to cram.

That was because Ling Han had already refined these Regulations. Three days underneath the Reincarnation Tree meant 300 years of comprehending Dao, which was enough time to refine these Regulations. However, while he had refined them, he had not put them to use yet, nor did he know how he should go about using them.

As he experienced it, zi, zi, zi, lightning flashed madly.

Actually, Ling Han was the most familiar with Lightning Regulations. That was because long since he had been in the small world, he had frequently shattered his own form and spirit to be tempered by divine lightning, and observe heaven’s might in the meantime, turning it into his own power.

Afterwards, he had obtained the Nine Heavens Flame, and had further retrieved the Xuanyin Source Water, so there were two Source Powers inside his body, which was equivalent to having two Celestial Kings constantly teaching him great dao without reservations at all times. He naturally became more inclined towards these two aspects.

But this did not mean that his comprehension in terms of Lightning Regulations was inferior. On the other hand, he had created a considerable number of Mystical Powers through Lightning Regulations—he couldn’t have drunk so much Heavenly Tribulation Fluid for nothing after all, right?

Thus, when the Lightning Regulations of the Celestial medicine surged through his mind, and after he analyzed them, they rapidly turned into his own understanding.

It should be known that this Celestial medicine was the most proficient in fleeing, and its speed was higher than even the large black dog’s. However, the large black dog was still well-versed in instant teleportation, and only then did he manage to cut it off.

The true extreme speed of lightning!

Ling Han’s eyes glowed, and then turned a blazing white in color. It was like even his eyeballs were formed from lightning. Successively, his whole body flashed madly with lightning, and his figure also began to speed up.

Pa, pa, pa, pa. Wherever he passed, lightning would be left behind in the air, and crackled loudly.

He had acquired a new Lightning Flash celestial technique!

Then, Luo Changfeng shockingly discovered that Ling Han was rapidly closing the distance between them.

He was so astonished that he almost spat his tongue out of his mouth.

It should be known that this was a Mystical Power that had been nurtured naturally by his Natural Lightning Physique. Even he could not maintain this kind of extreme speed for a very long time. It could not be helped. His cultivation level was limited, and he could only unleash so much power. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But this was already incredibly awesome, and he was sure that no one could match him in the Severing Mundane Tier.

But in Ling Han’s case?

This was no longer matching him, but rather surpassing him.

Could it be that this guy also possessed Lightning Element Source Power aside from the two Source Powers of Fire and Water?

You, could you be even more freakish?

His scalp was numb, but Ling Han was getting closer and closer. He was just a small distance away from being in his scope of attack.

Luo Changfeng humphed, and said, “Ling Han, you have killed Zihe Bingyun, and will definitely suffer being hunted down by a Celestial King Tier force. If you further offend our Thundercloud Palace, you will not have the slightest sliver of survival left!”

Ling Han laughed loudly. “You speak as if your Thundercloud Palace would spare me if I did not hunt you down.”

“I do not have a deadly enmity with you!” Luo Changfeng persuaded.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Do you take me for an idiot? You have already found out that I possess two Source Powers, and would also obtain the Heavenly Dao Jade later. With your greed, can you spare me? I can just guess that once I leave this Mystery Realm, you will definitely have the elites from the Thundercloud Palace come and deal with me.”

Luo Changfeng’s heart clenched. He had indeed been thinking that. “How could that be; I swear on my reputation!” However he thought was one matter, but he would definitely not admit it.

Ling Han shook his head. “Luo Changfeng, you are inferior to even a woman! Though Zihe Bingyun should have died 10,000 times over, she at least had some backbone. Faced with death, she had only chosen to fight, unlike you who are close to prostration!”

Luo Changfeng flew into a sudden fury. He was the Holy Son of the THUNDERCLOUD PALACE, and usually it would only be others prostrating in front of him.

“Ling Han, you are digging your own grave!” he shouted loudly. “Don’t think that just because you have the Nine Heavens Flame and the Xuanyin Source Water you can look down on every being in this world. You are only in third severance, and any Dividing Soul Tier would be able to easily suppress you!”

If a Dividing Soul Tier directly came into contact with a Source Power, that would definitely mean death. But facing a third severance, a Dividing Soul Tier elite could just crush him with a palm strike from afar, so how could they possibly allow Ling Han the chance to approach them?

Ling Han laughed. “Luo Changfeng, do you think that two great Source Powers are the trump cards that allow my arrogance?”

His trump card was the Black Tower. At least, a Dividing Soul Tier, or even Immortal Palace Tier, could not possibly discover a clue of it!

Luo Changfeng couldn’t help but pause, and an incredibly strong coldness suddenly surged up in his heart.

If even two Source Powers weren’t Ling Han’s trump cards, then what was his real trump card?

In this world, was there anything stronger than a Source Power?

The only thing that Luo Changfeng could think of was a Celestial King, but how could Ling Han be bringing a Celestial King with him everywhere he went? Wasn’t that a joke?

But no matter how he looked at it, Ling Han did not seem to be an idiot. The latter clearly knew that he would not end well if he killed both himself and Zihe Bingyun, but he had still made his move without any reservations, and hunted them down without any scruples.

“You, who exactly are you?” This time, Luo Changfeng was really shocked, and felt that even the Thundercloud Palace could not give him any sense of security.

“You guess,” Ling Han said smilingly.

All of a sudden, innumerable thoughts streaked through Luo Changfeng’s heart.

There were Nine Heavens to the Celestial King Tier, and each level brought one closer to ascending the heavens. This was not just mere empty words. Even if they were both Celestial King Tier sects, how could one that was created by a First Heaven Celestial King compare to one that was established by a Second Heaven Celestial King?

There was a gap of who knew how much!

The Celestial King of the Thundercloud Celestial King was a First Heaven Celestial King, but even though he was the lowest level among Celestial Kings, a Celestial King was still a Celestial King, and he could reign for all eternity. As long as he was not deadly enemies with another Celestial King, he would be an eternal existence.

Could it be that Ling Han was the descendant of a Second Heaven, or Third Heaven Celestial King? In fact... even Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

If that was not the case, where would he have gotten such confidence from? Furthermore, what Celestial King would bear to bestow two Source Powers of heaven and earth onto their disciple? Only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would because he had already reached the ultimate apex, so even the Source Power of heaven and earth would not have the slightest significance for him any longer.

He gritted his teeth, and asked, “What if I agree to accept you as my master?”

When he said these words, his heart was also squeezing painfully, and he felt as if his whole world had collapsed on him.

The revered and prestigious Holy Son of the Thundercloud Palace actually took the initiative to beg to become someone else’s lackey!
