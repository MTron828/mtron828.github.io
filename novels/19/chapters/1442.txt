Chapter 1443 Extreme Troublemaker, Large Black Dog

“That truly is a Divine Fetus nurtured by the Nine Deaths Heaven Art!” Empress Luan Xing whispered in Ling Han’s ear. In fact, she had used her divine sense to transmit this message. Thus, unless there was a Saint beside them, no one else could have heard what she had just said.

Her hand was gripping Ling Han’s wrist, and even with Ling Han’s freakish physique, he still felt a slight pain shooting through his arm. This was a sign of just how emotional Empress Luan Xing was.

As if feeling their gaze, Gu Daoyi also turned around to glance at them. However, his gaze didn’t stop on Ling Han.

In his eyes, Ling Han naturally wasn’t worthy of his attention.

Instead, his gaze landed on Empress Luan Xing. His eyes narrowed, and a meaningful smile tugged at the corners of his lips. It was evident that he had discovered that Empress Luan Xing was also practicing the Nine Deaths Heaven Art.

Just as he was a “delicious meal” to Empress Luan Xing, perhaps Empress Luan Xing was also a “delicious meal” to him. Perhaps she could help his Divine Fetus become even more extraordinary.

“Hurry, stop that dog!”

“This dirty dog is far too uncouth! It’s running around and biting people everywhere!”

A wave of commotion swept through the dense crowd, and it could be seen that a large black dog was currently running over from the distance, a huge group of people behind him. These people wore furious expressions, and it was clear that they were all seething with anger.

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. That was none other than the large black dog from the Medicine King’s Cave. Right now, it wasn’t as large as a mountain, but instead the size of an ordinary dog. Its fur was ink-black and shiny like oil.

However, this dog was truly a huge troublemaker, attracting the anger of so many people right upon arriving. In fact, his halo of trouble was even more intense than Ling Han’s.

The large black dog was extremely provocative as he ran, shouting, “Little sh*ts, why are you running so slow? How about Grandpa Dog takes a handicap of two legs?” As he said this, he indeed stood up, running on his two hind legs.

Pu!

Many people instantly spluttered with laughter. However, those chasing him were incensed even further. This was far too detestable!

“Little sh*ts, you still haven’t caught up? So be it. Grandpa Dog will walk upside down now. How does that sound?” The large black dog leaned on his front paws as if doing a handstand. However, his speed was still incredibly fast.

His provocations were definitely extremely effective. He was running away using just his front paws, yet he was still faster than all of the people pursuing him. He was truly smacking them across the face, again and again. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“F*cking c*nt dog!”

“We definitely have to capture and cut him into 10,000 pieces!”

“I’ve never seen such a shameless demonic dog before! He’s so bloody shameless!”

“Die!”

The pursuing people were burning with rage, and it was as if flames were spitting out from their eyes.

The large black dog was not only extremely quick, but also incredibly agile. He was like a fish in water as he slithered through the dense crowd of cultivators. Meanwhile, those pursuing him came across barrier after barrier, causing them to fall further and further behind the large black dog.

“Huh? Isn’t this Little Han? Come, call me grandpa!” The large black dog involuntarily stopped upon seeing Ling Han, waving his paw in greeting. However, he was in a handstand position right now, so this greeting was truly as peculiar as could be.

Ling Han was rendered speechless. This large black dog was just as debauched as always. He was always seeking to take advantage of others.

“Huh, this woman seems alright. She’s fairly beautiful. Why don’t you become my maid?” The large black dog stared at Empress Luan Xing, attracted by her charm even though he was a dog. Drool started to roll down from his mouth.

“How audacious!” Nie Tiancheng immediately roared. He was intent on making a good impression before Empress Luan Xing, so he immediately launched a strike at the large black dog. Numerous heavenly bodies instantly materialized in the air. These weren’t the heavenly bodies from his Dantian, but rather heavenly bodies that had been formed from his cultivation technique. The surrounding space was filled with heavenly bodies.

“What are shouting about, ugly wretch? See how Grandpa Dog disposes of you!” The large black dog immediately leaped forward, surprisingly breaking through Nie Tiancheng’s attack. He then ruthlessly bit down on Nie Tiancheng’s wrist.

“Owww!” Nie Tiancheng instantly howled in agony.

Back then, even Ling Han had felt some slight pain after being bitten by the large black dog. However, could Nie Tiancheng’s physique compare to Ling Han’s? Thus, this bite instantly drew blood. Moreover, Nie Tiancheng couldn’t shake the large black dog off no matter what he did.

“Let go! Let go!” Nie Tiancheng was almost on the verge of tears. This large black dog was far too uncouth! It was actually biting people! Of the elites in the world, who ever fought like this?

There was a loud crack as Nie Tiancheng’s arm was brutally bitten off.

Carrying this broken arm in his mouth, the large black dog continued to run away. This was because the people chasing him had already arrived before Ling Han.

“Detestable dog, return my arm!” Nie Tiancheng also started to chase after the large black dog. Although he could regrow his arm, doing so would definitely consume a portion of his life force. Thus, he naturally wanted to snatch his severed arm back. That way, attaching his severed limb would consume much less of his life force.

“Come, chase Grandpa Dog!” The large black dog stood up on his hind legs again, running as quick as the wind. “Don’t say that Grandpa Dog is scolding you people, but you people truly are a group of trash!”

“Detestable dog!”

“C*nt dog!”

The group of people was beside themselves with rage as they continued to chase after the large black dog.

Shan Jingyi couldn’t help but celebrate his luck. Thankfully, he had been a split second slower than Nie Tiancheng. Otherwise, the person with the broken arm might have been him. Although he was conceited, he didn’t think that he was stronger than Nie Tiancheng. Thus, there was naturally a lingering fear in his mind.

Anyhow, perhaps this large black dog wasn’t truly as powerful as he seemed. However, he was indeed mysterious, and it seemed as if Origin Power couldn’t do much to stop his advance. Add to that his terrifying teeth, and this large black dog truly made for a difficult opponent.

Moreover, he was also incredibly quick, immediately running away whenever he was done with provoking someone. This gave his victims absolutely no chance of exacting revenge.

Nie Tiancheng had truly suffered a great misfortune.

With the large black dog causing trouble everywhere, the originally serious atmosphere instantly descended into chaos. The cultivators all laughed heartily as they watched the large black dog running around and causing trouble everywhere. However, those who became his victim would all immediately seethe with rage.

“Grandpa Dog is certain to reach the pinnacle of this world. I’m recruiting servants now, and this is a rare chance for you to apply. If you miss this opportunity, you might never see it again!” The large black dog continued to shout as he ran. It was a mystery where he had thrown Nie Tiancheng’s broken arm.

“You, you, you, you, and you! Grandpa Dog will give you people an opportunity,” the large black dog said as he continuously pointed at random people.

Those who were pointed at naturally became enraged. Most of the people here were king tiers, yet this dog was actually asking them to become his slaves? How could they accept this? The dignity of king tiers couldn’t be violated! Some people were easygoing, and they simply shrugged this off with a smile, acting as if nothing had happened. However, many more people were infuriated, joining the group of people chasing the large black dog.

This large black dog was truly born to be a troublemaker. If one were to ask who was the most famous at this moment, the answer would definitely be the large black dog. His renown had instantly surged past that of Gu Daoyi and Empress Luan Xing. However, his renown was for his detestable nature, and he was much like a street mouse, hated and cursed by everyone.

“Sigh, Grandpa Dog is far too brilliant... My brilliance is even attracting the jealousy of others!” There was a narcissistic look on the large black dog’s face.

“Detestable dog, fight us if you dare!” The pack of chasing people was about to go crazy with rage.

The large black dog waved a paw, and said, “Grandpa Dog doesn’t want to bully you people.” As he said this, he continued to run away, not even stopping for an instant.

After chasing him for half a day, not even a single person had managed to catch up to him. The large black dog was genuinely too quick. Moreover, the path that he had taken was also quirky and unpredictable. It was no wonder that he dared to provoke so many people.

If one wanted to become the enemy of the people, they would first need to master the training of their legs.

Three days passed, and the large black dog was still running around, as provocative as always. So far, he had already offended almost one-tenth of the people present at the valley. There was now a vast group of people chasing after him.

Right at this moment, a column of light suddenly rose from the valley. At the same time, a humongous golden boulder also soared into the sky, instantly reaching a height of 300 meters above the valley. It then stopped and hovered in place, radiating with a boundless divine light as it did so.

“The Sunken Abyss Valley has opened!”
