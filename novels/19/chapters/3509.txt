Chapter 3510: Want to kill Old Sun’s brother?

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Ling Han steered the golden bull and ran madly.

Though the speed of the golden bull was not as fast as Xuan Tianling, it had reached ten times the speed of sound. When it ran, it was protected by a shield of light, so there was no need to worry that its body would be shattered if it ran too fast. Aside from some slight bumps, it could be considered a perfect means of transportation.

“Did you run in the wrong direction?” Princess Bixiao warned. This guy wasn’t running in the direction of the Imperial City at all.

She sighed. At first, she had thought that Ling Han was calm, but she had not thought that he was only pretending. He had even gotten the direction wrong. Ling Han turned around and asked, “Do you think that we can flee all the way back to the Imperial Capital?”

Er, that was naturally impossible. To say nothing of the fact that it would take a few days to return to the Imperial Capital, Xuan Tianling would only need about ten minutes, at most, to be able to capture or kill them.

“Then it’s useless even if you run randomly!” Princess Bixiao shouted.

Ling Han laughed loudly, “Don’t worry, I am not running around randomly. Believe me.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Princess Bixiao was speechless. Things have already come to this, and you still want me to believe you? How can I believe you?

Unless Ling Han had even more chess pieces on him.

“Brat, how many more treasures do you have?” Xuan Tianling laughed loudly, and grabbed out with his palm again.

Ling Han greeted it with the chess piece. Though he had dispersed another blow, the “Elephant” character on the piece had dimmed considerably.

One strike, two strikes, three strikes. After more than ten strikes, the

“Elephant” character had completely disappeared, and this chess piece had also cracked, no longer having any effect.

“Ant, you still want to resist stubbornly?” Xuan Tianling asked coldly.

Another palm strike descended. There was nothing else that could be done. Ling Han could only control the golden bull to parry.

Peng!

The attack was dispersed, but the energy of the Dao Stone also dropped greatly.

Peng, peng!

After another two consecutive strikes, the golden bull could only flee, no longer having the ability to disperse the might of a single strike.

“Haha, behave yourself – wu?” Xuan Tianling was just about to make a move, when he suddenly lost his balance, and fell down from the skies.

Thankfully, he did not fly very high. Just when he was about to crash onto the ground, he somersaulted, and stood firmly.

Peng, under the massive impact, a loud sound was heard from the ground. A shockwave spread out in all directions with him as the centre, and all the trees, flowers and rocks shot up into the skies, forming a mushroom cloud.

“What’s going on?” Xuan Tianling was completely baffled. Why had he suddenly fallen down?

He was not a young Celestial that had just learnt how to fly on a Spirit Tool, so how could he possibly lose control?

“You guys won’t be able to escape!” he humphed, and continued to chase after Ling Han and Princess Bixiao. His speed was still fast, but the ground was uneven, so he could not fully unleash his extreme speed. Furthermore, he had also lost direct traces of the two of them, so it was inevitable that there would be errors in his course.

In a short while, he would not be able to catch up.

Ling Han finally breathed a sigh of relief. He had already entered into the area of Haiping Mountain, and when he saw Xuan Tianling fall from the skies, he knew that he had come to the right place.

There was a great formation here that was suppressing Brother Monkey. Perhaps it would have an effect on elites of Celestial Path. Ling Han took a gamble, and won.

And his true hope was naturally Brother Monkey. He only had to draw this Cauldron Forging Tier cultivator in front of Brother Monkey, and Brother Monkey would naturally be able to solve the problem.

Ling Han was filled with confidence in Brother Monkey’s strength.

Flee, flee, flee. The golden bull’s legs flew, ten times the speed of sound, crossing mountains and crossing the plains as if it was walking on flat land.

However, after only a while, Ling Han saw Xuan Tianling’s figure in the distance.

His speed had reached twelve times, or even fifteen times the speed of sound, and every step he took would take him more than ten miles away. He was rapidly approaching.

F***, are you on steroids?

At this moment, Ling Han couldn’t rush it. The golden bull’s speed had already reached the pinnacle.

However, the Monkey Valley was finally within sight.

“Ling Han, think of something quickly!” Princess Bixiao called out.

“Do you think I’m omnipotent?” Ling Han sighed. Now that the reinforcements were right in front of him, he finally relaxed, and was in the mood for jokes.

Princess Bixiao wore a tragic expression, and said, “I never thought that I would actually die with you!”

Ling Han was instantly displeased. ‘What are you saying?’

Was he really that unbearable?

“Your death is here!” Xuan Tianling’s voice rang out. He had already caught up to them, and stretched out a hand to grab them.

“Brother Monkey, save me!” Ling Han suddenly shouted at the top of his lungs.

Meanwhile, Princess Bixiao closed her eyes. This guy was already so scared that he didn’t know what he was doing. Even if you were calling for help, shouldn’t you call for mother?

“What are you screaming for? Things have already come so far, and you still expect anyone to come and save you?” Xuan Tianling smirked coldly, “You are truly delusional”

“Brat, what do you know!” A voice suddenly rang out.

F***, he must have seen a ghost!

Xuan Tianling was immediately astonished, “Who?”

“When Old Sun moved unhindered through the world, your ancestor still hadn’t been born yet!” the voice continued.

“Don’t hide yourself, come out!” Xuan Tianling called out loudly. The other’s voice seemed to have come from the skies. Clearly, the other had used some kind of technique.

“You want to see Old Sun?” the voice asked.

“Come out!” Xuan Tianling shouted loudly.

Xiu, a figure flew out. He had a tall, broad build, and was completely black in colour.

Xuan Tianling couldn’t help but be taken aback, because what jumped out was actually a large monkey, standing on its hind legs.

After sweeping an eye over it, he immediately smirked coldly. This large monkey was merely a Mystery Realm Tier. How ridiculous.

A streak of golden light floated and entered into the large monkey’s body. Instantly, as if it had been pumped full of adrenaline, this large monkey’s aura instantly soared, flying past the Celestial Gate, and became a Foundation Building Tier cultivator. Then, it continued to improve, stopping at the Cauldron Forging Tier.

F***, he could do that?

Xuan Tianling inhaled sharply, his whole person trembling.

He now understood. This large monkey was indeed only a Mystery Realm Tier.

However, it was controlled by the Spiritual Power of an elite, which forcibly increased its cultivation level.

Actually, he could also do this, but at most, he could only help his “substitute-reach the Mystery Realm Tier. It was really too difficult for him to breach the gap of the Celestial Gate.

Hence, the strength of this elite that had not shown himself was practically inestimable, causing him to involuntarily tremble.

“Senior, I did not know of your might, and have offended you greatly. Please forgive this junior this once, Lord Senior.” He knelt down, and paid his respects to the large monkey.

Even if this large monkey’s true cultivation level was only Mystery Realm Tier, it was like he was facing a supreme elite, so he could only be extremely careful.

“You want to kill Old Sun’s brother, and you want Old Sun to spare you?” The large monkey spoke up, and instantly, there was an indescribable viciousness about him.

Xuan Tianling’s expression involuntarily turned ugly. His body trembled. He had not thought that Ling Han, an ant in the level of Inscription Tier, would actually have such a terrifying backer.

Even Princess Bixiao glanced at Ling Han, her heart filled with shock. She had always thought that Ling Han’s biggest backer was Chen Fengyan, but from the look of things now, this “Brother Monkey” seemed to be even more awesome.

Hold on, Demonic Monkey Fists!

She immediately recalled that the mysterious elite that Ling Han spoke of was this Brother Monkey. It was Brother Monkey that had taught the Demonic Monkey Fists to Ling Han.

When she thought of this, her heart involuntarily beat wildly.. Could she take this chance to learn the Demonic Monkey Fists?
