Chapter 1962: Celestial King Bloodstone

This was not Ling Han’s ability, but rather the Black Tower’s might.

When the flow of time slowed down to the maximum, the result was... immobility!

Shua, the Divine Demon Sword swept out, and with a pu, a high-quality hog’s head flew skywards out of nowhere. However, it instantly vanished, and the body of the hog also collapsed, similarly breaking into bits and pieces, and leaving behind only a single stone as red as blood.

Hu, hu, hu. Ling Han used the Divine Demon Sword like a cane, continuously panting, his expression very ugly.

The price for using this move was too massive, exhausting him completely. It was not only his Origin Power, but also his soul. His whole person seemed to have become a blank piece of paper, where the only thing remaining was emptiness.

He could use time acceleration and deceleration as he liked, but the more serious the effects, and the wider the range, the more it would take out of him. This apex immobility of time made Ling Han directly lose all ability to continue battle.

Furthermore, this move could only be used once a month in real time. It was useless even if he went into the Time Cultivation Chamber. The Black Tower would need to draw out a certain energy from real space. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ling Han, you are so awesome!” Hu Niu immediately pounced. “You managed to kill even an Earth soul-level monster with a single move. So awesome, so great, Niu wants to have kids with you!” Everything the little girl said was all for the sake of the last line, yet Ling Han was only willing to embrace her and kiss her, which made Niu very displeased.

Peng, Ling Han was immediately pushed down by Hu Niu. At this point, he did not have the slightest bit of strength left.

Hu Niu giggled, and planted kisses on Ling Han’s face non-stop. Not only did she kiss him, she also licked and bit him, acting very much like a little kitten.

Meanwhile, Bewitching Maiden Rou was incredibly stunned. That creature just now was an Earth soul-level monster? And Ling Han had actually killed it with a single strike? Just how strong was he?

Yet she did not know that this was not Ling Han’s own battle prowess, but rather the might of the Black Tower. It could only be used once a month, and had almost drained Ling Han completely. If there were a few more enemies, that would only be a suicidal action.

However, this time she could shamelessly pick up that blood-colored stone.

But the moment she moved, she saw that the Empress grabbed the stone in her hand with a wave of her hand.

“Sister...” she called out plaintively.

The Empress swept a stern eye on her, and said, “I have my own plans on the allocation.”

“Oh!” Bewitching Maiden Rou twiddled her fingers. In front of the Empress, she would not have the slightest temper.

“Girly, get up.” Ling Han was almost suffocated by Hu Niu’s kisses, yet the other two women did not seem like they had any intention of giving him a hand.

Hu Niu giggled, and said, “Let’s have babies.” This was constantly in her mind.

Ling Han began to lecture her righteously again, and took out a considerable amount of food before the little girl temporarily forgot about the matter of having babies.

He recovered some energy, and finally could stand up and walk around.

“What stone is this exactly? It actually contains a sliver of Regulation of Slaughter.” Ling Han had the Empress take out all the blood-colored stones. The stone that represented the Earth soul monster was very clearly much larger.

“This is Celestial King Bloodstone.” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

“Hmm?”

“In an intense Celestial King Tier battle, blood splatters on the ground, and these stones have been stained with a sliver of Celestial King Tier blood, yet had not shattered. After countless years of development, a strange change has taken place,” Small Tower explained.

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder there had been strange human-like creatures and Demonic Beasts, but when they were killed, there was no actual body. As it turned out, the root of everything was the blood that had been left behind by the Celestial King.

As expected of a Celestial King. He had merely spilled a little blood, yet after countless years, it could actually result in such a shocking mutation.

“Then this Celestial King must have cultivated the Regulation of Slaughter,” he surmised resolutely.

“At least Seventh heaven Celestial King.” Small Tower also made its own deduction.

It looked like the rumors were not false. A great many natural Mystery Realms had been the battlegrounds that had been left behind after Celestial Kings battled, and contained the immortal and ageless will of the Celestial King. After countless years of development, the power of heaven and earth would also be added in, so it would become a natural Mystery Realm.

Ling Han nodded, and said to the Empress, “Put them away. Looks like we should be able to encounter more of such monsters, and collect even more Celestial King Bloodstones.” He roughly outlined Small Tower’s words to them.

Ordinarily, one could only cultivate the Regulations of the Five Elements and Lightning, while other Regulations could only be gained through specific Celestial medicine or certain unusual treasures. However, these Regulations were more powerful, and could be maintained until right before Celestial King Tier.

Hence, the value of these Celestial King Bloodstones was extraordinarily high.

...From a different perspective, the value of the Black Tower was what was truly astounding. It actually contained the three Regulations of Slaughter, Time, and Space. If Ling Han comprehended these Regulations, and was still unable to become an Emperor that destroyed all his peers, then he really would be trash.

The four of them continued on their way, and very soon, they encountered another human-like monster. Hu Niu and the Empress rushed forward together, and dealt with it quickly.

But subsequently, they encountered a great dilemma.

Another beast-like monster appeared, having Earth soul-level battle prowess, and chasing Ling Han and his group to scramble everywhere.

Thankfully, this monster seemed to have a specific range of activity. After they left this range, this monster would also stop, and no longer pursue them.

Hu, the four of them exchanged looks, and suddenly broke out into laughter.

In a battle of equals, they had never been chased everywhere by their opponents. This was a very novel experience.

“After we break through to the Dividing Soul Tier, we will be able to beat these monsters easily.” Ling Han rubbed his nose. It was unfortunate that Time Stop could only be used once a month. Otherwise, there would have been no need for him to run.

“However, after we break through to the Dividing Soul Tier, we won’t be able to enter this place anymore,” the Empress said.

“Niu can!” Hu Niu exclaimed, raising her hand. “Niu also has a great ultimate move, and killing these monsters would be as easy as slaughtering chickens.”

“How frequently can you use it?” Ling Han asked.

“Once every three months.” Hu Niu raised three fingers.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Don’t waste it on these minor characters. Unless in a life-or-death situation, don’t use it. This is to be used to save your life.”

“Okay, Niu knows.” Hu Niu nodded obediently.

They continued to go deeper, and when they encountered Yang soul and Yin soul monsters, they would move to kill them. If their opponent was Earth soul-level, they could only break into a run and flee.

After these several times, they had also diverted from their original course, but it could be confirmed that they were still heading to the depths of the valley because those three peaks were there as their guide, so they couldn’t possibly have lost their way.

This valley was astonishingly huge, and they weren’t able to use movement techniques to sprint at full speed ahead, either. Thus, their speed of traveling was naturally not going to be fast. A whole three months had passed, and they still hadn’t made it to the middle.

That was because they still hadn’t reached the foot of the three peaks. This would be the sign that they reached the middle.

“According to Yan Xianlu, there is also great fortune at the foot of the three peaks,” Ling Han said. “But as for exactly what it is, the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King did not tell him.”

“Then let us go and take a look. It should not take too much time.” The Empress nodded.

They headed to the left mountain peak. Seven days later, Hu Niu suddenly stopped, and then looked like she was sniffing around. Then, her eyes narrowed. “So aromatic!”

Ling Han naturally believed the nose of a glutton with absolute certainty, and asked, “What do you smell?”

“The aroma of Celestial medicine!” Hu Niu opened her eyes. “So fragrant, at least five billion years old, and has reached Small Accomplishment at least.”

“Then we need to go and take a look!”

The four of them changed course, with Hu Niu leading the way. They followed the aroma, and after they walked more than 100 miles, only then did Ling Han and the Empress smell a refreshing fragrance.

As expected, they could not compare to a glutton.
