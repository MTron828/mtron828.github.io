Chapter 1802: Intolerable

Ling Han frowned upon seeing this.

“As expected, something’s wrong!” the large black dog murmured from behind him.

He could still consider the green mist attack and tongue attack from before as instinctive actions from wood element beings, yet this sudden release of corroded corpses was definitely not a “skill” that wood element beings should possess.

Perhaps this tree was relying on its green mist to capture prey, which it would then digest in its body? Perhaps these corpses were prey that it hadn’t finished digesting yet?

Gasp!

If that were the case, then these corpses all belonged to people who had entered the mystery realm this time.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

At least a dozen or so headless corpses stood up. Their bodies swayed about, and they were radiating with a rotten smell of death that would cause one to vomit.

“My head!”

“My head!”

“Return my head!”

The headless corpses released their thoughts, which formed a wave-like ripple.

This was extremely strange. Without a mouth, how could one speak? Similarly, without a head, how could one convey their thoughts? As such, how were these headless corpses relaying their thoughts?

Since they didn’t have heads, they naturally didn’t have any eyes, either, yet it was as if all of them had eyes that were staring at Ling Han. As they raised their arms, their flesh fell from their bones until only their skeleton was left. However, there were still scraps of rotten flesh attached to the bones, and they looked as repulsive as could be.

After a short pause, these headless corpses then charged toward Ling Han at an incredible speed.

“I’ll send you all to the afterlife!” Ling Han said with a cold expression. He launched a punch that was imbued with the soaring power of lightning, causing a sea of lightning to form before him.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

However, the headless corpses were extremely agile, and as they jumped, they easily dodged Ling Han’s attack.

‘Interesting...’

Ling Han released a battle cry before wielding an expanse of lightning as if he were the son of lightning.

Boom!

He finally clashed with the headless corpses, yet he was surprisingly sent flying backward like a cannonball. However, the headless corpses were also dealt a heavy blow. After all, the power of lightning was no joke.

Crackle...

Blinding white lightning arced through the air, and it was as if the headless corpses were performing a jerky dance, with each of their bones shuddering uncontrollably.

Ling Han bared his teeth in pain as he picked himself up from the ground. He felt as if all of his bones had been loosened by the devastating clash. As he stood up, he was still a bit dazed, so he couldn’t help but stumble a little.

“Aaah...!” As if suffering unimaginable pain, the faces on the White Demon Tree released a piercing and contorted cry.

Pu!

The White Demon Tree released another burst of green mist that enveloped all of the headless corpses. The arcs of lightning on the headless corpses instantly died down, and after a short moment, they completely vanished.

This first exchange ended in a draw.

After recovering, the headless corpses immediately launched another wave of attack at Ling Han. Some of them lunged into the air, while others directly charged toward him head-on. Some of them also dashed over from his sides. The headless corpses fully utilized their advantage in numbers.

At this moment, a sinister gleam suddenly flashed across the eyes of the man that Ling Han had saved. To everyone’s surprise, he suddenly lunged over to attack the Empress.

This woman was far too beautiful, and her stunning beauty caused his heart to beat in excitement. Ling Han had saved him, yet he was now attacking the Empress and attempting to kidnap her now that Ling Han was being surrounded by a group of headless corpses.

Moreover, he was attacking the Empress from behind. With his fourth severance cultivation level, he was confident that he could capture her without a hitch.

“Aaah...!” However, just as lunged forward, he suddenly felt an agonizing pain traveling over from his bottom. He instantly roared in pain, and his voice was as miserable and shrill as could be.

He observed the surroundings with his divine sense, only to discover that a large black dog had chomped down on his bottom at some unknown time.

‘Gasp! When did this dog lunge over?’

“You’re seeking death!!” the Empress roared as she hurriedly turned around. Her eyes were filled with killing intent.

She wasn’t enraged because he was repaying kindness with evil. Rather, she was enraged because such trash actually dared to target and attack her. After all, with her proud and haughty personality, she couldn’t care less whom they saved at all. Anyhow, she wouldn’t take these matters to heart.

However, was she someone whom any random person could violate?

She immediately raised her hand.

Swoosh!

Countless rays of sword light furiously slashed toward the man.

The man was completely stunned. This attack was far too terrifying. It was imbued with countless powers of Regulations, and it was as if the entire great dao were crushing down toward him. He felt as if he were about to be crushed into nothingness.

Peng!

He was instantly sent flying, transforming into a tiny black dot in the distance.

“Why has Grandpa Dog also been sent flying?” The large black dog’s voice traveled over from the distance. He was still biting the man’s bottom, so he was naturally sent flying with him as well.

Ling Han humphed upon seeing this, and he immediately launched an attack to push the headless corpses aside. At this moment, his entire body was shrouded in lightning.

Peng!

His legs bent slightly, and he immediately launched himself into the sky.

Crackle...

Channeling his power of lightning and also using his brute strength, he was able to lunge into the air at an incredibly quick speed.

He instantly caught up to the man, and he easily grabbed him before returning to the run-down village.

“S-spare me!” the man stammered.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Even though I saved you, I didn’t ask you to repay me or anything. Yet, you actually decided to repay my kindness with evil. This is taking things too far, and it’s not something that I can tolerate! I won’t kill you, either, but I’ve decided to rescind my decision to save you.”

“No! No! No!” the man exclaimed in shock. He almost wet his pants in fright.

However, Ling Han completely ignored him as he tossed him back to the White Demon Tree.

The White Demon Tree immediately released a burst of green mist before unleashing a long vine that grabbed the man, and pulled him toward the trunk of the tree.

There was terror on the man’s face. He could naturally guess that all of the headless corpses were people who had been dragged into the trunk of the White Demon Tree. Afterward, their heads had disappeared, and their power had also been slowly absorbed. In fact, even their corpse would be controlled to do battle.

“Save me! Save me! Save me!” the man screamed in despair.

Ling Han wore a cold expression, and he was completely unmoving.

The Empress was more so wearing an expression of pride and haughtiness. In her eyes, only Ling Han and those who were close to him were worthy of her attention. Others were like nothing more than sand and dust. It mattered little whether they lived or died.

“Aaah...!” The agonized wails of the man instantly halted as he was dragged into the trunk of the White Demon Tree.

“You’ve inflicted this fate upon yourself!” Ling Han said coldly. Had that man truly thought that he was a foolishly benevolent person?

The large black dog ran over to the Empress, and said, “Can you be softer next time? Grandpa Dog was almost torn apart!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Empress completely ignored his question. She was incredibly proud and haughty.

Because it had captured another prey, the White Demon Tree didn’t launch another wave of attacks at Ling Han. Instead, the headless corpses retreated to its side as if they were protecting it.

“The beings here have all developed a powerful ability of slaughter,” the large black dog said. Theoretically speaking, the White Demon Tree should have only been able to absorb all kinds of violent and chaotic auras. In other words, it should have only been able to threaten cultivators using its murderous aura.

Now, however, it was actually swallowing the physical bodies of cultivators, and even using their headless corpses to do battle. This far exceeded his expectations and imagination.

The White Demon Tree started to squirm in a rhythmic manner. After a short while, a new face appeared on its trunk. This face also wore an agonized expression, and it was as if the person had suffered unimaginable torture before their death.

Pu!

A headless corpse suddenly fell out. It was initially dazed, yet it quickly locked its senses onto Ling Han.

“Where’s my head?”
