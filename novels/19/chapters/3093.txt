3094 Prodigy!

‘Let’s not worry about this for now. Since I can sense my meridians, I’ll cultivate first.’

Ling Han was very big-hearted. He laid down the doubts in his heart, and focused on punching. More power surged into his body and circulated in his meridians.

This meridian was very sluggish, as if it contained many impurities. However, every time power surged through it, it was as if a plow had been used to clear it.

Ling Han discovered that his meridian was actually so small and filled with impurities. Under the repeated clearing, many impurities were brought out, and his meridian was also slowly becoming wider.

Suddenly, he realized that there was no longer any power surging into his body. No matter how he punched, he couldn’t enter this state again.

‘What’s the reason?

‘Eh, so dirty!’

He realized that there was a layer of black substance on his hands, and there was even a fishy smell.

When he looked again, it wasn’t just his hands. His arms, thighs, and entire body were like this.

‘Could it be that these are the impurities that were cleared out from the meridian?’ Ling Han suddenly came to a realization. ‘That must be it!’

He quickly went to take a shower.

This world was very strange. There was no need to fetch water. It was connected to the room through an iron pipe. As long as a switch was turned, water would flow out. In fact, one could even choose whether it was hot water or cold water.

Ling Han took a shower and washed off all the dirt on his body.

“Rumble!” His stomach growled.

So hungry!

Ling Han was astounded. Ever since he had reached accomplishments in cultivation, he had lost his sense of hunger, but not only was he hungry now, he even felt as if he was so hungry that he could swallow an entire cow.

He called Huan Xue over, and asked her to prepare some food.

After eating, Ling Han continued to practice his fist techniques.

However, to his disappointment, no more wisps of power surged into his body.

From morning to noon, and then to night, Ling Han did not stop. He practiced for another night, and only stopped when he was truly exhausted.

If it had been yesterday, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to last that long. However, after absorbing that wisp of power this morning, his physique seemed to have become much stronger, allowing him to persevere.

Of course, it wouldn’t work if it took too long, but it shouldn’t be a problem for just one day and one night.

The night passed, and light appeared again in the east.

The moment the sun jumped out, that power came again. Slivers of coolness surged into Ling Han’s body, and there was an indescribable sense of comfort.

‘Could it be that it’s because of the sun?’ Ling Han thought. When it was dawn, there might be some kind of special resonance, but when the sun had risen completely, this resonance would disappear.

Sure enough, after a while, the power stopped surging over.

Ling Han stopped. There was no point in continuing to train. He would only feel fatigue, and it would be a complete waste of time.

‘According to the meridian diagram, the one I’m opening now is the Zuyang Bright Gastric Meridian.

‘Practicing the fist technique is only effective during the early morning hours.

‘It means I can’t sleep in anymore.

‘I’ll go and take a shower.’

Although he could only cultivate for a short while, Ling Han’s body was once again stained with filth, and it was simply insufferably smelly.

‘This world is a little like the mechanical dimension in the Genesis World. It’s mainly focused on technology.

‘However, there was a turning point in history more than 100 years ago. Martial arts flourished, and technology was ruthlessly crushed by martial arts.

‘However, although technology doesn’t have the upper hand when it comes to fighting, technology brings a lot of convenience in daily life.’

Ling Han looked at the clock hanging on the wall. It was said that this had been an ordinary item before the upheaval of the world, but now that a large number of factories had been turned into ruins, this kind of thing was very rare, and there was no repairing it if it broke.

A night passed, and Ling Han woke up early to practice his fist techniques in the courtyard. The entire process only took about half an hour, and if it was any longer, there wouldn’t be any effect. He could only improve his proficiency of the fist technique.

Just as he finished his breakfast, he was summoned by Sun Jianfang.

“Greetings, Sect Master.” Ling Han bowed respectfully. No matter how high he had stood before, he was now an ordinary person. He had just opened a meridian in his body, and could barely be considered to have embarked on the path of cultivation.

Sun Jianfang nodded, and asked, “Have you studied the fist manual I gave you a few days ago?”

“I did,” Ling Han answered honestly.

“If there’s anything you don’t understand, feel free to ask,” Sun Jianfang said. He paused for a moment, and said smilingly, “I gave you the time of these few days because I wanted you to ask all the questions you’ve accumulated so that you wouldn’t waste time going back and forth.”

‘Oh, I see.’

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “There’s nothing I don’t understand. I’ve learned everything.”

Sun Jianfang was about to drink his tea, but upon hearing this, he couldn’t help but reveal a trace of displeasure. He put down the teacup, and said, “If you know, you know. If you don’t know, you don’t know. This old man hates people who act like they understand when they don’t the most!”

The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched. There was really nothing he didn’t understand. Could it be that he wanted him to pretend to be stupid?

“There’s indeed nothing I don’t understand,” Ling Han said.

Sun Jianfang almost kicked him, but after thinking about it, he forcefully suppressed this urge, and said, “Alright, since you’re so confident, demonstrate it to me.”

“Alright.” Ling Han nodded, and immediately assumed his stance, starting to practice.

Every move was perfect.

Sun Jianfang was flabbergasted, looking as if he had seen a ghost.

He had already overestimated Ling Han. That was why he had summoned Ling Han today to give him some pointers.

In his opinion, Ling Han should have practiced one-third of the fist technique at most in just these few days, and he would definitely have a lot of questions. This was already a very high estimate of Ling Han. After all, the latter was a “Divine Son,” and could not be measured by the standards of ordinary people.

But now?

Not only had Ling Han mastered the entire set of fist techniques, but he had also not made the slightest mistake. It was so perfect that even Sun Jianfang could not help but want to applaud.

F*ck, this is too exaggerated.

Was the Divine Son that impressive?

A prodigy! No, a super genius!

He was so excited that he wanted to praise Ling Han. With such a successor in the Ancient Dao Sect, they would definitely have the upper hand in the glorious future and stand proudly.

But when he thought about it again, he shook his head inwardly.

No, this kid was already proud enough. If he praised him again, wouldn’t he be so puffed up that he would simply soar into the skies?

Sun Jianfang nodded slowly, and said, “In the end, you didn’t disappoint me. This is a little like it!”

With that, his face burned. Would he be struck by lightning for lying and going against his conscience? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han retracted his hands, and only smiled slightly. He didn’t point it out, either. He had to leave some face for the other party. After all, the other party was an elder and an elite. As for Ling Han? Going by the flow of time here, he wasn’t even half a year old.

He should give the other party some face.

“Since you no longer have any problems with your fist techniques, I’ll tell you about the meridians,” Sun Jianfang said. He sighed in his heart. According to his original plan, this should only be discussed a month later.

“The path of cultivation is long, and we have just come into contact with this domain. Our knowledge is extremely limited.”
