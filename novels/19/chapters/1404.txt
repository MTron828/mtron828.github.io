Chapter 1405 Beaten by whom?

Zhao Lun’s request was actually very logical. A Great General of the empire had died, and as the Left Minister, and presently the highest commander, he could not possibly overlook this matter no matter what. But the problem now was that Ling Han was too strong. He had been able to kill Zhao Jianbai with a single slash, so killing him could also be very easily and happily done.

The Left Minister loved power, but if he was asked to give up his life for the sake of power, he would only snort derisively.

He was cursing internally. The matter had already continued for such a long time; why had the Right Minister and the other five Generals not appeared?

It was definitely not because they had not yet reached their destination, but rather because they had long since arrived. Previously, they had watched the battle in secret, and now none of them dared to step out.

‘I will pretend that I have not arrived, and know absolutely nothing. In future, no one would be able to say anything about my lack of action,’ they thought.

‘But f***, you guys have screwed me over!’ The Left Minister’s lip twitched madly. This was also because the power of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire was too poor. Aside from the empress and the Nine Kings, there was actually no one else who had reached the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. Now that the empress and the Nine Kings had gone into seclusion together, no one was capable of doing anything to Ling Han.

This was also the weakness of relying on a single elite to bear the weight of an entire force. The moment this elite was absent—for example, if he had gone travelling or into seclusion—this force would become extremely fragile.

“Lord Left Minister, please take vengeance for my father!” Zhao Lun knelt down, his eyes streaming with tears.

His father had died, so he was definitely sorrowful. However, only he himself knew how much of his tears was genuine grief, and how much of it was mere exaggeration.

There were many people watching the excitement, but now, not one of them could speak. This was a battle on the level of the Heavenly Body Tier, and they weren’t even qualified to interrupt. Jing Wuxue and the others were rueful. In the past, Ling Han was still their little junior brother, but what about now?

They were still at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier; there was practically no change, but Ling Han was shockingly already in the Heavenly Body Tier!

They all were human beings, so why was there such a large difference between them?

“This...” The Left Minister dragged out the last syllable. It was absolutely impossible that he would pick a fight with Ling Han, but a Great General had died. This was also an earth-shattering matter, and could not be overlooked simply by playing dumb.

“Ling Han!” A clear shout rang out, and a valiant and formidable woman appeared. She was dressed in battle armor, and had a crimson cloak draped over her shoulders. It was about three meters long as if flew in the wind behind her, showing her heroic spirit on full display.

Qu Qiuxue, the Great Commander of the Imperial Guards!

When the Left Minister saw her, he immediately felt his heart settle. In terms of battle prowess, Qu Qiuxue actually surpassed himself because she bore the heavy responsibility of guarding the Imperial Palace. Not only could she draw on even more power of the nation, she could also invoke the great formation of the Imperial Palace to a certain extent.

What Right Minister, what Five Great Generals, they were not as dependable as this woman!

“Lady Qu!” Ling Han greeted with clasped hands. He was still filled with considerable respect for Qu Qiuxue.

Qu Qiuxue’s face was cold as she said, “You are now already in the Heavenly Body Tier, and are on equal level with me. I dare not accept the respectful address of Lady. Let me ask you, have you come to our empire to show off your strength?”

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “I have no intention to bluster around. At first, I wanted to seek an audience with Her Majesty, but as the empress has gone into isolation, I decided to stay a while here. I did not think that so many things would happen afterwards.”

Qu Qiuxue’s expression cleared slightly, and she said, “You have killed a Great General of our empire. There are too many implications involved in this matter, and it cannot possibly be finished like this. When Her Majesty comes out of isolation, there will definitely be a resolution.”

“All right!” Ling Han nodded. What relation did he have with the empress? In the past, for the sake of the Nine Kings, she did not hesitate to kill a Great General, and now, for her beloved, what would killing another matter? Furthermore, it was Ling Han who had personally killed him. And if it came down to it, it was Zhao Jianbai who provoked him, and delivered himself straight to be killed.

Zhao Lun’s eyes were malicious. He knew it was no longer possible to use someone else to kill Ling Han. The Left Minister did not dare move at all, and Qu Qiuxue was unwilling to move, either. He stepped back quietly. He had long since become enemies with Ling Han, and now Ling Han would definitely call him for an accounting. If he didn’t run, wouldn’t that simply be waiting for death?

“What are you running for?” However, he had just taken a step when he heard Ling Han’s calm voice ring out by his ear. Next, he was gripped by an invisible hand and picked up.

“Ling Han!” Qu Qiuxue glared angrily. ‘You have already killed a Great General of the Empire; do you still intend to commit murder?’ As the Great Commander of the Imperial Guards, she could not pretend that she had not seen this.

Peng!

A loud sound rang out, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was seen to have been struck down. Meanwhile, Sha Jing was standing proudly in midair. After all, his cultivation level was much higher, and he also had the additional boost from power of the nation, so he naturally had the upper hand in this clash.

“Ling...” Sha Jing was just about to begin shouting when he spotted Zhao Jianbai’s body that had already been hacked into two halves, much to his shock.

‘F*ck!

He naturally would not think that this had been done by the Left Minister or Qu Qiuxue. Putting aside the fact that neither of them had this kind of courage, they did not have the abilities to do so, either!

There was only one person... Ling Han!

Hiss, this young man was actually powerful to this extent?

Sha Jing could not see through to Ling Han’s cultivation level, but he had thought that Ling Han had deliberately concealed his cultivation level all this while. They were all in the low extreme, so this was naturally easily done. But now, from the look of things, he had guessed wrongly.

He could not distinguish his cultivation level, because Ling Han’s cultivation level was above his own!

Thus, the other had easily killed Zhao Jianbai so quickly and with so little commotion that even he had not noticed. That was because the pressure the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had exerted on him was also very heavy, so how could he possibly dare divide his attention?

He trembled, and shrank back.

It was one matter to fight on the battlefield. He had killed millions because he knew that his abilities had definitely reached the summit, and there was definitely no one capable of killing him, and not because he was unafraid of dying and was a born homicidal maniac.

In the face of the pressure of death, he sweated madly, and his whole back was completely wet in an instant.

The hatred of killing his son?

Er, he was not Zhao Jianbai. He had quite a number of sons, and Sha Yuan was only one of them. Moreover, he was not the most outstanding one, either. Now that he was dead... then he was dead.

“Are you all right?” Ling Han turned to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shot upwards. There were traces of blood on her body and at the corner of her lips, but her vitality had not been reduced. She looked a little aggrieved and slightly stubborn as she said, “I lost!”

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “How could you have lost, you must have remembered wrongly!” He looked at Sha Jing, stretched out his other hand. His hand covered the skies, and pressed down on Sha Jing.

‘So what if you’re in the Heavenly Body Tier, that is how overbearing I can be!’

Qu Qiuxue’s fingers trembled slightly, and she had the urge to move. But when she saw this palm of Ling Han did not have the slightest bit of killing intent, she forcibly repressed the impulse.

How could Sha Jing defend against this all on his own? The massive hand pressed down, and he was directly pressed onto the ground. Peng, peng, peng, peng. Innumerable shock waves of Origin Power later, Sha Jing was immediately blasted to beyond recognition and made for a tragic sight.

Ling Han withdrew his hand with a smile, and said, “Look, Wife, isn’t he more seriously wounded than you? It naturally is your victory.”

‘This...!’

In broad daylight, you were practically lying through your teeth!

As it happened, Ling Han was not going to give up the matter here. He turned to Sha Jing and asked, “Brother Sha, whom were you beaten by?” His eyes narrowed in a glare, the ferocity in them on full display.

At this moment, his killing intent soared, and looked completely like he would be committing violence at the slightest disagreement.

Sha Jing was incredibly aggrieved, his hands tightly gripped into fists. Using the quietest voice, he replied, “I was beaten by her.”
