2699 An impostor

Yun Aokong looked at the large black dog, and suddenly felt apprehensive.

From his point of view, the person in front of him didn’t have any strong aura circulating about him, but was just so perverse that he felt a chill down his spine. However, being able to defeat Situ Taisun, he would have to be a Celestial King, right?

Both of them were Celestial Kings, but he wasn’t able to see through the depth of his opponent’s strength. Could it be that the other party’s cultivation level was actually higher than his own?

“What is your name?” He decided to first test the large black dog’s strength.

“I’m the Black King!” said the large black dog loftily.

“Black King?” Yun Aokong murmured under his breath, and started a frantic search in his mind, wondering whether he had previously heard of or seen someone with this name. After a round of searching, there was indeed someone named Black King in his memory, but none could match with this perverse man in front of him.

“Why aren’t you prostrating and kneeling down in my presence?” the large black dog demanded boldly.

Yun Aokong felt apprehensive, but it was naturally impossible for him to be afraid of his opponent in his own territory.

Did you think that every person was Ling Han?

“Sir, you are too arrogant!” Yun Aokong said menacingly; this person was ignorant indeed. Didn’t he know how powerful the Yun Clan was?

“When I clean out your clan’s treasure chamber, you will know how arrogant I am!” the large black dog shouted, his eyes gleaming with greed in addition to the perverseness in his gaze.

Yun Aokong was furious. This person actually had the guts to think of attacking their Yun Clan treasure chamber?

Situ Tailong couldn’t help laughing, and said, “Brother Aokong, it seems that your noble clan needs to start killing people, otherwise everyone will think that it’s easy to bully the Yun Clan.”

Yun Aokong nodded. Did most people think that the Yun Clan had become weak because of the incident caused by Ling Han? Now any random Celestial King would dare to walk all over him—this was really too insolent. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sir, allow me to test your strength!” Yun Aokong took a step, and boom, his aura exploded.

The large black dog obviously could suppress Yun Aokong with just one hand, but if he didn’t make use of someone who could be ordered around, then would he still be him?

“Little Han, go on my behalf!” he yelled at Ling Han.

Pa, Ling Han kicked towards the large black dog, causing the large black dog to dash off hurriedly.

“Huh, you?” Yun Aokong looked at Ling Han with a strange expression.

This person’s appearance… was so familiar, but he couldn’t recall whom he resembled at the moment.

“Hey, he looks a bit like the person who is already dead,” Situ Tailong said.

Yun Aokong suddenly realized that this person did look a little like Ling Han, but obviously he didn’t impersonate him very well, because Ling Han had a domineering aura, and even the sun couldn’t suppress his splendor. However, the person in front of him had a subtle aura, and had no distinctive features; he was standing there like an ordinary person.

Since Ling Han had been born and set the record for heaven-defying battle merits, he had also won the favor of countless young people, with all eagerness to pursue him and follow suit, so it wasn’t surprising to see a person with appearance and temperament similar to Ling Han’s.

It was just that this person in front of him wasn’t a good enough impersonation.

“Humph! I hated that person the most, and yet you insist on making yourself look like him, this is courting death!” Yun Aokong said coldly. He once again raised his hand towards Ling Han to grab him.

Pa!

Ling Han waved his hand, and directed a slap at Yun Aokong from a distance. With his strength, was there any possibility for Yun Aokong to resist?

Raising a hand, his palm landed, and the man collapsed.

When Yun Aokong fell, a strange thought crossed his mind: why had he collapsed like this again? There was a feeling of deja vu about this.

Situ Tailong was shocked—his strength was almost on the same level as Yun Aokong’s, but Yun Aokong wasn’t enough to be Ling Han’s match for even one exchange, so far from it in fact that Yun Aokong fell with just a single strike launched from a distance. This was absolutely crushing strength.

“Who the hell are you?” Being so powerful, and yet having to imitate someone—it was truly such a shame.

“Ling Han,” Ling Han said evenly.

Situ Tailong scoffed. Ling Han was already dead. It couldn’t be that the dignified Yun Clan would release fake news?

“Sir, you are also an overlord yourself, so why impersonate a dead person?” he asked.

This was him stalling for time as he just wasn’t Ling Han’s match, and could only wait for the Yun Clan to send reinforcements.

Ling Han chuckled, and looked at the large black dog. “Why doesn’t anyone believe me when I tell the truth?”

“That’s because you’ve been telling too many lies!” The large black dog took the opportunity to speak in reprimand. “Little Han, when one does bad things, heavens are watching, and there will be retribution, so you have to be respectful and courteous to Grandpa Dog, who is your great benefactor.”

Situ Tailong was trembling with anger. His younger brother was planted into the street like a tree, while his companion was knocked out by a single blow, and yet these two people were still teasing each other in front of him. This was too arrogant.

As for the Yun Clan, why hadn’t anyone come?

Xiu, xiu, xiu, at this moment, five people descended from the sky, all showing off their powerful aura.

This was the territory of the Yun Clan, and they were the Celestial Kings of the Yun Clan, so naturally there would be no need to conceal anything.

These five people were all Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, and moving together, they would just be able to take on a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

“Who’s the madman to have the impertinence to come to my Yun Clan and cause trouble?” a Celestial King shouted, his sweeping gaze landing on Ling Han and the large black dog.

His gaze focused upon Ling Han, and he just felt that this young man seemed very familiar.

“I’m here to collect a debt,” Ling Han said lightly.

Collecting a debt?

Why was it so popular nowadays to come to Yun Clan to collect debts? It was all because Ling Han had set a terrible example. He really wanted to dig him out of the ground and flog his corpse for 10,000 years.

Situ Tailong folded his arms over his chest, and said coldly, “He said his name was Ling Han.”

Ling Han?

The five Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings all sneered. Indeed, the person in front of them did resemble Ling Han, but the difference was also obvious. And the most important thing was that Ling Han was already dead!

How could a dead person still be standing here?

“Who the hell are you, and why did you come to Yun Clan to cause trouble?” a Celestial King asked.

“Who gave you orders to do so?”

If asked to believe that a Celestial King would come to the Yun Clan to cause trouble, none of them would believe it. How could there be so many audacious people in the world?

“Don’t you feel ashamed of causing trouble under a dead person’s name?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but find it funny. When did he die?

“I’m too lazy to talk nonsense with you. Once I suppress all of you, Yun Haoyang should come out!” Ling Han said with a smile as he stretched out his hand to grab a Celestial King.

“How dare you!!” The five Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings acted together simultaneously to fight off Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched open his palm; it was as if the sky was collapsing.

The five Celestial Kings countered it together, but they couldn’t block the strike, and pa, pa, pa, all of them collapsed.

At the sight of this, the people around them couldn’t help but gape.

This was ridiculous. Those were actually five Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, but they were no match for Ling Han.

“A Ninth Heaven Celestial King!”

“Absolutely.”

They all gazed at Ling Han with admiration. He was one of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, who stood at the highest peak of the Celestial Path. Who wouldn’t admire him?

Ling Han “planted” the five Celestial Kings upside down in the ground one by one.

“Brat, you have such a bad taste,” the large black dog said.

Ling Han looked at Situ Tailong, and said, “What should I do with you?”

Situ Tailong also looked at Ling Han, and extended a finger that was trembling violently. “Y-you really are Ling Han! You are not dead!”

Being so unbelievably strong, with appearance so similar to Ling Han’s, and even behaving similarly—who else could he be if not Ling Han?

The Yun Clan had made a huge mistake: this bringer of calamity and freak wasn’t dead at all.
