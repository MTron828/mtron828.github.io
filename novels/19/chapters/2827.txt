2828 Blood Clay

“Ling Han, is it? I’ve been looking forward to meeting you for a long time,” Luo Tongfang said. He had recovered his aura as a First Tier, and he was speaking with extreme confidence at this moment.

Heavenly Venerates—which of them wasn’t a supreme prodigy? With both being at the First Tier, who would be weaker than the other?

Thus, even though Luo Tongfang approved of Hao Jing’s method to poison the Lings using blood clay, he was still an extremely proud person at heart. He was confident that he could suppress Ling Han even without resorting to such underhanded methods.

Peng!

However, Hao Jing’s next move was something that Luo Tongfang hadn’t anticipated at all. He directly blasted a hole in the wall before shooting out and fleeing into the distance.

‘This…’

Luo Tongfang was absolutely infuriated.

Hao Jing’s actions were a clear sign that he didn’t believe in Luo Tongfang’s ability to defeat Ling Han. In fact, they implied that Luo Tongfang didn’t even possess the right to rival Ling Han. It was because of this that Hao Jing had fled so quickly.

‘F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!’

Luo Tongfang was infuriated to death, and he glared at Ling Han with a baleful expression. He imagined the moment that he decapitated Ling Han and tossed his head before Hao Jing; just what expression would Hao Jing wear?

“Oi, oi, oi, don’t let your mind wander,” Ling Han said with a smile. He didn’t pursue Hao Jing, because Hu Niu had already gone after him.

Could a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate flee from the clutches of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?

Did they think that everyone was Ling Han?

“Ling Han, at the same cultivation level, I, Luo Tongfang, won’t lose to anyone!” Luo Tongfang said with confidence.

“Oh,” Ling Han replied with a nod. “Do you have any last words?”

“Die!” Luo Tongfang roared as he unleashed an attack.

Weng!

A Heavenly Venerable Seal immediately pulsated in his hand. This was one of the more widely known seven seals, and it could raise his power four-fold.

At the same time, he channeled a secret technique, with a bloody wolf materializing behind him and howling at the sky, summoning a bloody moon that radiated with a boundless sense of desolation and misery.

Boom!

The blood wolf swallowed the moon, and Luo Tongfang also charged over at the same time, with his right hand transforming into a wolf paw as it shot over with a destructive might.

Ling Han shook his head, and responded with a casual swat.

Pa!

This strike was unstoppable, and Luo Tongfang’s outstretched arm was the first to shatter. Ling Han’s palm then struck his chest, its explosive might instantly crushing it into pieces.

Luo Tongfang wore an expression of utter shock, awash with disbelief as he stared at Ling Han.

Peng!

His entire body collapsed into pieces, completely dismembered.

They were both First Tier Heavenly Venerates, yet he was actually unable to withstand a single strike from Ling Han?

He finally understood why Hao Jing fled with such resoluteness upon seeing Ling Han. This was because he knew that they were no match for Ling Han.

The gulf between them was like the gulf between heaven and earth.

His expression was spiritless and dazed. They were both at the First Tier, so how was he so much weaker than Ling Han?

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t care about Luo Tongfang’s thoughts. He quickly retrieved a Spatial Celestial Tool from Luo Tongfang’s body before examining it with his divine sense and extracting a jade vial.

He felt an instinctive apprehension toward the matter inside the vial. This was something that he definitely didn’t want to touch.

This was the flesh of a Heavenly Venerate that had been corroded by Hysteria?

Ling Han carefully unplugged the vial, only to see wisps of black air drifting out and forming all sorts of shapes. However, these shapes were all of poisonous creatures such as spiders and centipedes.

He squatted down next to Luo Tongfang’s decapitated head.

With his power suppressing Luo Tongfang, Luo Tongfang was completely unable to knit his body back together and heal his wounds.

“Get that thing away from me!” Luo Tongfang cried in astonishment, his face filled with terror. He appeared even more tense and terrified than when he had been blasted into pieces by Ling Han just then.

By the looks of it, this thing was truly extraordinary. This was clear just by looking at Luo Tongfang’s terrified expression.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Since you’re so terrified of it, then why did you bring it all the way here? And you even wanted to feed it to me. Say, even though I’m a glutton, I’m not an absolute fool, am I? Did you really think I would eat this?”

‘If Hao Jing truly acted out his plan, he would have definitely used some method to cover the aura of this thing so that no one could notice any problem.’

Of course, he definitely didn’t dare to say this.

“Friend, I was also deceived by others, so please spare me this one time!” he begged as he clenched his teeth. As a Heavenly Venerate, it took him a great deal of courage to utter these words, with his face bright red with shame.

Ling Han involuntarily laughed, saying, “Others bring small presents from hundreds of miles away, the present trifling but the thoughts and feelings deep. Meanwhile, you’ve brought me poison from tens of thousands of kilometers away. What should this be classified as?”

Luo Tongfang was rendered speechless. Right now, his only saving grace was that the main culprit was Hao Jing, while he… had only been responsible for bringing some things over.

“I genuinely didn’t know about my junior brother’s plans at all,” he said.

Ling Han poured out a bit of the content from the vial, the black blood clay. He then spread it on one of Luo Tongfang’s arms.

Theoretically speaking, the arm of a Heavenly Venerate would remain healthy and undecaying even if it were severed. However, after coming into contact with the blood clay, it instantly started to decay and rot before eventually transforming into a puddle of blood.

‘How poisonous.’

Ling Han looked at Luo Tongfang, simply shaking his head without speaking.

“Ling Han, Niu has captured him!”

Peng!

Hu Niu jumped in, a person in her hand. It was none other than Hao Jing.

How could a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate possibly escape from a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?

...

Pa!

Hu Niu tossed Hao Jing to the ground.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “The first time I saw you, I said that good times don’t last long. By the looks of it, my prediction was indeed correct.”

Hao Jing gritted his teeth, vexation on his face.

He didn’t know where he had gone wrong. In all these years, his behavior had been normal and unsuspicious. He hadn’t left any flaw at all! He wore a wry and aggrieved smile as he asked, “How did you see through me?”

Ling Han didn’t keep any secrets, and he explained the entire process.

Hao Jing was almost angered to death. He had actually lost to Ling Han’s love for his daughter!

‘You daughter-doting freak! Your daughter is already a Celestial King, yet you’re still so worried about her?’ Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He was filled with bitter resentment. It wasn’t he who had made a mistake, and it wasn’t that he was careless. Instead, it was Ling Han who was a f*cking daughter-doting freak! It was because of this that Ling Han had coincidentally noticed something off about him.

He was filled with resentment… Utter resentment!

“There’s no need to feel so vexed and aggrieved. Even if you weren’t targeting my darling daughter, did you really think that a First Tier and a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could defeat three Heavenly Venerates? Moreover, the three Heavenly Venerates are at the Third Tier and Second Tier,” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. Hao Jing had truly been dreaming.

...

This blood clay was indeed very impressive. However, would it be any easy task to poison him with it?

“I admit defeat!” Hao Jing hung his head, and said, “What do you want from me?”

Ling Han was astonished. “You really believe I will spare you if you give me something in exchange?”

Hao Jing humphed, and said, “My father is Hao Tianjun, a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate. If you kill me, my father will find and kill you no matter where you flee and hide!”

Ling Han pondered for a moment before murmuring, “Have I killed the son of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate before?”

After a moment, he shook his head, and said, “I’ve killed far too many people, so I genuinely can’t recall. No matter, after killing you, I would’ve definitely killed the son of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate.”

“You—!” Hao Jing was astounded. This wasn’t anything to be proud of, so why was Ling Han acting as if it were? He hurriedly said, “Aren’t you afraid of my father seeking revenge?”

“Heh, even if I were afraid, do you think I’d forgive a vermin who targeted my family?” Ling Han said with a shake of his head. “Trash like you is better off dying early and reincarnating early.”

Peng!

With a single punch, Hao Jing was instantly smashed into minced meat.
