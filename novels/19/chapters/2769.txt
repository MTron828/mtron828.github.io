Chapter 2770 Imperial Void moves

If it had been Ling Han before the accident, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate would never have dared to attack Ling Han. Even Crimson Clouds Heavenly Venerate wasn’t Ling Han’s match, let alone the Imperial Void.

That was why he had asked for help from his master.

However, before the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable made a move, the news of Ling Han being crippled came out, and after a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate’s examination, this matter was confirmed, so there was no need for the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable to make a move.

…Having a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate deal with a cripple? How insulting was this towards the Heavenly Venerate? The Imperial Void didn’t even know how far overqualified he himself was for making the move personally.

He could have casually sent anyone to deal with Ling Han, but if he couldn’t avenge his son’s murder with his own hands, he wouldn’t be at peace in his heart.

Hence, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate took action himself.

His speed was very fast. He couldn’t allow Ling Han to enter the Realm Battlefield, or he would have scruples when he made his move. If someone was to find out that he injured a comrade-in-arms, even a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate wouldn’t be able to protect him, especially when Ling Han had previously made such a great contribution for the Genesis World. Literally, his ranking was still listed on the general leaderboard, and no one would be able to threaten his position for at least dozens of epochs.

In a valley, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate finally intercepted Ling Han and his traveling companions.

Xiu, his figure emerged, exuding a strong killing intent, and the pain of losing his son made his eyes bloodshot.

“Ling Han, where do you think you are going?” he demanded coldly.

Whether he was a good person or a villain, a sinner or a hero, it might be left to history to pass judgment, but he was definitely a loving father.

Ling Han showed a faint smile. Why had he insisted on going back to the Martial Academy to remove his status as a disciple?

Firstly, he wanted to release the news that he was going to the Realm Battlefield in order to lure out those who harbored ill intentions towards him.

Ling Han was just a cripple now1. Although there were Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings by his side, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was enough to deal with them.

Secondly, without Ling Han possessing the identity of a disciple of the Martial Academy, the perpetrator could be more “relaxed” in revealing their murderous intentions. Even if the matter of this battle was leaked, it would be just an ordinary vendetta, and there would be no need to bear any responsibility.

The appearance of the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was within Ling Han’s expectations; what he wanted to know was whether there would be other people as well.

For example, Zhuo Bing, whose son had been slapped to death by the Empress. However, the Empress had had the status of a disciple of the Martial Academy to protect her at that time. Would this person show up this time?

Now Ling Han was truly pretending to be a pig to devour a tiger. What he didn’t know was how many big tigers would be showing up.

“Imperial Void, it’s been a long time,” Ling Han said. Among the people whom he hated the most, the Imperial Void was definitely ranked among the top three.

During the invasion of the Foreign Realm, not only did the Heavenly-Venerate-level forces, headed by the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, and Green Flames Heavenly Venerate, not resist the foreign enemies, but they also kept being a hindrance, and the Imperial Void was the one who had tried to take Ling Han’s property and kill him several times.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, Ling Han didn’t really bear deep hatred towards the elites of the Foreign Realm, because if he had been to swap positions with them, he might have done the same thing as the Foreign Realm’s elites under the oppression of the general environment.

However, traitors were absolutely not to be tolerated in his eyes, and had to be punished.

“It’s been a very, very long time!” the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate said solemnly, his eyes fixed on Ling Han. He wouldn’t simply kill Ling Han; he had to let this villain go through the highest extent of suffering and torture before killing him.

“You are an elite of the Celestial Realm, but you didn’t show up when the Celestial Realm needed you. Not only that, you even harmed the compatriots of the Celestial Realm. Betraying your own people and helping the enemy! How can a beast like you have the gall to stay alive?” Ling Han said sarcastically.

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate didn’t get angry. If he had been one to lose his temper so easily, how could he have broken through to become a Heavenly Venerate? He just smiled faintly, but the killing intent became more and more intense.

“How do you want to die?” the Imperial Void asked.

“Old bastard, you are the one who should die!” The Empress rushed out, raised her hands, and delivered a strike towards Imperial Void.

Boom, the power exploded to the heavens.

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was disdainful at first, but when the Empress made a move, he could clearly see that the latter was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, which caught him slightly by surprise. However, that was about it. How could it be that a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate like him couldn’t suppress a First Tier Heavenly Venerate?

But when he realized the power of this strike by the Empress, he was affected.

So strong, this was definitely not the might of a First Tier!

Peng!

The two exchanged blows. Both people trembled, and they retreated continuously.

“You!” Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate stood still. He didn’t suffer much from this blow, but he didn’t gain much advantage in this exchange, either.

He was aware that he hadn’t advanced to the Second Tier Heavenly Venerate very long ago, and that his battle prowess could not be compared to that of a veteran Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, but wasn’t the fact that a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would suppress a First Tier Heavenly Venerate a matter of course and naturally right?

How could this woman be so powerful?

Could it be that those with Ling Han were all super freaks?

The Imperial Void frowned. Although he had a slight advantage in strength, defeating the Empress wouldn’t be an easy feat.

This matter wasn’t easy to deal with!

Despite having these thoughts on his mind, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate naturally didn’t have the slightest intention of giving up. This was the best chance to get rid of Ling Han, and he still had the advantage in terms of circumstances, but it wouldn’t be as easy as he had imagined.

He would have to spend a little bit of effort. The Empress was putting up a defense, but if she stayed on the defensive for a long time, she would certainly be caught off guard at some point. As long as he could grab a chance, he would be able to kidnap Ling Han.

Of course, if it was possible, the Imperial Void would want to capture everyone, and torture and kill them one by one in front of Ling Han so that the latter could also have a taste of losing his loved ones.

‘Ah, right, this brat also has a son… Hehe!’

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate moved and attacked the Empress. This First Tier Heavenly Venerate ought not to be underestimated.

The Empress let out a clear whistle, and charged ahead without fear.

She wasn’t as fearful and nervous as the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate thought, because Ling Han’s battle prowess was stronger than hers, and he could break through to become a First Tier Heavenly Venerate at any time. Was there a need for her to worry?

The two people battled intensely.

Ever since the Empress had broken through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, she hadn’t fought against a real Heavenly Venerate. Hence, with her fighting spirit blazing, she fought very aggressively, and continuously delivered strong attacks.

This angered the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate to the extreme. ‘Do you think that you really are a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate?’

He also let out a loud roar, unleashed a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and fought head-on with the Empress.

The fierce battle between the two great Heavenly Venerates set off a terrible storm, whereby the stars fell, the mountains were easily flattened, and the seas evaporated in an instant. This was the collision of powers that surpassed Regulations—its destructive power was absolutely terrifying.

However, no matter what, the Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was unable to suppress the Empress.

He was quite shocked. Logically speaking, under his high-intensity suppression, the Empress should barely be able to catch her breath. Her strength ought to be exhausted soon. After all, she was just a First Tier.

But after fighting for so long, the Empress’ power could still be maintained at such a high level, just like at the beginning of the fight, which made him unable to believe and accept it at all.

...

If this was to continue, could he really suppress the Empress?

He changed his mind, and glanced at Ling Han. It would be better to take down the main person first; he could go all out in the fight that way. Being able to take down the Empress would be the most ideal, but if he couldn’t… then there was no loss.

“Heh, Brother Imperial Void, do you need my help?” At this moment, a voice was suddenly heard.

The Imperial Void Heavenly Venerate was stunned for a moment, and then he was overjoyed. “Brother Zhuo!”

Zhuo Bing, Zhuo Kai’s father, a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

The Imperial Void had just recently advanced to become a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, but Zhuo Bing had done so much earlier because when the former had still been at the Ninth Heaven, Zhuo Bing had already been a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

With the two Heavenly Venerates joining forces, not only would they be able to take down Ling Han easily, even suppressing this weird First Tier Heavenly Venerate would not be a problem.
