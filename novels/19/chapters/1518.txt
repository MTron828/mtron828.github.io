Chapter 1519 Gu Daoyi arrives, the chest opens

No wonder Ling Han managed to become the troublemaker of the eighth campus. If he himself did not possess strong abilities, it was useless, even with the help of Ren Feiyun.

At first, when the rumors spread out, everyone thought that the fact that Ling Han had avoided being taken down a notch was completely due to Ren Feiyun’s help, but from the look of things now, Ren Feiyun’s contribution couldn’t go unnoticed, but Ling Han himself was also extremely powerful.

Those from the eighth campus all felt proud. Even the seniors were no exception. In the larger picture, the eighth campus was a family, so their weapons naturally had to be directed at the outsiders.

“He’s too strong. Even Bian Du, a senior who has not taken many years to climb up to the eighth place among the last batch of seniors, has been defeated.”

“I truly do not understand; the Great Saint actually did not take such a prodigy as his disciple.”

“Hiss, how strong would that Gu Daoyi be, then?”

Though the first place of this batch of new students was Ling Han, because it was Gu Daoyi who had been taken in by the Star Sand Saint as a personal disciple, it was equivalent to announcing to the whole world that Ling Han was inferior to Gu Daoyi.

Though everyone had seen Ling Han show his might, as time passed, with the fact that the Saint represented the will of the heaven and earth, this concept would have a real impact on the people, especially when one word from the Great Saint was like a golden rule.

Thus, everyone thought that Gu Daoyi was stronger!

Why had the Star Sand Saint taken Gu Daoyi as his disciple so quickly? Wasn’t it just to boost Gu Daoyi’s confidence? He feared that he would not stand back up from his setback.

The effects of this were astonishingly good. At least, every student thought that Gu Daoyi was stronger than Ling Han at present.

Right at this moment, a starship was seen descending from the skies. The starship had not completely stopped when a person leaped down from it. There was divine light glowing all over him, as if he had been born from the heaven and earth, and was the very center of the universe.

Gu Daoyi, the greatest prodigy of all eternity, an exceptional Divine Fetus!

They were just talking about him, and he was already here. They really were destined enemies.

“Gu Daoyi!”

“Hiss, just how long has it been since his battle with Ling Han? It seems like he has again become considerably stronger.”

“As expected of the greatest prodigy of all eternity. Now, with the personal guidance of the Great Saint, his abilities would advance at a pace that none of us can imagine.”

“Sigh, this gap would only become bigger and bigger.”

The new students all shook their heads. At first, they were filled with confidence, and believed that man could conquer nature. After all, they were all king tiers themselves. However, now when they saw Gu Daoyi again, a heavy blow was struck against their confidence.

There were some people that you really could not help but be impressed with.

There were very few that had not lost their confidence. However, they were all king among kings, such as the Second in the World, Long Xiangyue, Hong Ma and the others. All of them were focused on Gu Daoyi, their fighting spirit blazing in their eyes.

Ling Han, on the other hand, kept a low profile. He wanted Gu Daoyi himself to realize the extraordinariness of the chariot.

Though Gu Daoyi was only in the low extreme, he could stand with his arms crossed behind his back. The Divine Fetus exuded a slight glow, and not even big shots dared to underestimate him. Furthermore, this was the 10th personal disciple of the Star Sand Saint. Who would dare put on airs in front of him?

“Junior Brother Gu!” Many people greeted him. It was very possible that he would become the 10th Saint under the teachings of the Great Saint. If they did not quickly form connections with him now, in future, they would no longer be worthy of associating with him.

However, there were no big shots among them. People like Ren Feiyun and the others were all incredibly proud. How could they possibly turn around to curry favor with a little junior brother?

Gu Daoyi completely ignored them. His eyes merely paused a while on Ling Han before he quickly withdrew his gaze. He surveyed this chariot, as well as the corpses of three Phoenix Kings that had wrapped around each other. Slowly, an expression of shock appeared on his face.

Who was he? The Severing Mundane Ancestor of the Celestial Realm, so his insight was naturally excellent.

True Phoenixes! Furthermore, they were in the Saint King Tier!

At first, he did not much believe that a Celestial King secret technique would appear in this place. But previously, during the large turmoil, there had indeed been a great many Celestial Kings that had suffered the tragedy. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have obtained a part of the inheritance of the Nine Deaths Heaven Art from the ancestral grounds of the Nine Snake Tribe himself.

This allowed him to form the Divine Fetus in his 10th life, and also filled him with greed for the Heaven Arts of the Celestial Kings.

An incomplete cultivation technique was already so awesome; how great would an actual complete Heaven Art be? This was also why he had to refine Empress Luan Xing. It would greatly make up for the holes in his own Nine Deaths Heaven Art. Even if it did not reach a complete level, it would still be innumerable times more powerful than now.

He had come with a slight sliver of hope, but when he saw the Phoenix Kings pulling the chariot, it caused his heart to throb madly.

Perhaps... maybe... it really was possible!

He strode over to the side of the chest, and stretched out his hands to open it.

Many people were displeased. They were greeting him, and he completely ignored them. He was really too arrogant! It should be known that he was only in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier; he was not a Saint.

Gu Daoyi was completely indifferent. In truth, he did not even take Saints seriously. All the elites in the Immortal Realm were only trash in his eyes.

His hands gripped onto the lid of the chest. With a pull, weng, a sudden streak of golden light spread out from inside the chest.

“It’s open! There really is a chance it can be opened!”

“As expected of Gu Daoyi; both his cultivation and physique have far surpassed his peers!”

“I can’t help but admit I’m impressed.”

Seeing this scene, everyone felt rueful. Even some big shots nodded involuntarily. They themselves had tried to do so, and their physique was completely inadequate.

As expected of a young man that a Great Saint had an optimistic outlook of; he was indeed shocking.

Ka, ka, ka. The chest was slowly opening, and a vein was also popping out on Gu Daoyi’s forehead. Even if he was a Divine Fetus, presently, he was still not as strong as he would wish. His arms were trembling, and he was close to collapsing.

“Let’s all work together!” A good few big shots rushed forwards, moving respectively to hold up the chest’s lid.

Previously, the chest had been tightly closed, and they could only exert force through their fingers. The situation was different now. The lid had already been lifted a good few inches, and they were completely capable of holding the lid up with their palms. The difficulty of these two tasks were completely different.

With everyone working together, especially the big shots, this chest was finally opened slowly.

“It’s open! It’s really opened!”

“I wonder what treasures are contained inside.”

“They must be precious treasures; didn’t you see even the big shots were not able to open it?”

“Definitely!”

Everyone had prepared themselves to fight over the treasure. Before opening the chest, they naturally would be amiable with each other and even work together in collaboration. But once the treasure appeared, there was nothing else left to say.

Those that were not qualified to lend a hand previously drew out a treasured Spirit Tool. It was one matter to open the chest, and competing for its ownership was another. Were their Pseudo-Saint Tools and other such Spirit Tools just decorations? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Weng, the chest was opened. Golden light spread out, directly shooting up into the skies.

Immediately, everyone rushed forwards. The treasured chest had opened, and if they were slower than their competitors, nothing would be left.

A great battle erupted without any advance notice; that was how unruly they were.

“Brat, let go of me. Grandpa Dog is going to go show off his abilities.” The large black dog also wanted to join in on the excitement, yet Ling Han had grabbed onto its exposed tail, so it could only claw at empty air.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Don’t go. It will only be a waste of time.”

The large black dog gave a start. It was an existence on the level of an ancestor at screwing people over. Immediately, it turned its eyes. “Brat, is this something that you’ve come up with? Based on Grandpa Dog’s understanding of you, how could you possibly be so calm and unflustered!”

“Why can’t I be calm and unflustered?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

“You exude an air of greed from your very bones. Grandpa Dog can smell it from miles away. You are still far from being able to trick your Grandpa Dog!” the large black dog declared, pointing at Ling Han.
