Chapter 1233: Invitation from Milady

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Jiang Yue Feng was naturally at the Heaven’s Sword Palace at this moment. Meanwhile, Chen Rui Jing was traveling and adventuring in all kinds of places. He was a cultivator, and thus he needed to seek improvement through battles.

As for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, she was currently living in seclusion in the Water Element Valley, which was around 1500 kilometers from the Han Lin Pavilion.

Ling Han decided to visit the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden straight away.

Toppling the Five Sects could wait until later. After all, this would be a relatively long process. However, he had already made this wife wait for 10,000 years, so he didn’t want to make her wait for one second longer.

He exited the Han Lin Pavilion. Just as he was about to set off, a horse-drawn carriage blocked his path. A woman in azure curtseyed at him from within the carriage, and said, “Grandmaster Ling, you have an invitation from Milady.”

“Who?” Ling Han asked in surprise.

“Grandmaster Ling, won’t you find out once you get on the carriage?” the woman in azure said with a smile. She had a beautiful disposition.

Judging by her outfit, she was probably a maid. However, even a maid like her possessed such a captivating charm. Just how beautiful and seductive was her master?

Ordinary people would definitely become lost in a boundless world of fantasies, and readily agree to enter the carriage so that they could witness the other lady’s appearance.

However, Ling Han was in no mood to do such a thing.

He shook his head, and said, “I’m fine.” He waved his sleeve and strode off into the distance.

“Hey, hey, hey!” The woman in azure hurriedly jumped off the carriage and blocked Ling Han’s path. She puffed her shapely chest out, so much so that it almost touched Ling Han. Ling Han had no option but to take a step back.

When women became unreasonable, men really had to be careful. Otherwise, if he were to come into contact with her chest, he would definitely be the one getting blamed for taking advantage of her. Definitely.

“Grandmaster Ling, Milady is one of the most breathtaking beauties in the world. Heaven knows how many talented men are lining up in the hopes of meeting her. However, whether or not Milady meets them is all up to her mood.” The woman in azure seemed especially proud, and she continued, “Right now, Milady is going out of her way to invite you for a meeting, yet you’re actually going to turn down her invitation? Aren’t you afraid that Milady will feel sad?”

“What does that have to do with me?” Ling Han asked indifferently.

“You’re not allowed to turn her down!” the woman in azure said. She reached over to grab Ling Han, and said, “Grandmaster Ling, since you’re not willing to get on by yourself, I have no option but to force you on!”

Boom!

A formidable aura surged from her body. She was actually a Sun Moon Tier elite!

Ling Han was astonished. A mighty Sun Moon Tier elite was actually working as a maid?

However, he naturally wasn’t afraid.

He clenched his hand into a fist and punched at her. Because he had mastered the Lightning Sword Technique and grasped a wisp of heaven’s might, his fist was not only lightning-quick, but also extremely destructive.

Zi!

There was a chaotic dance of lightning.

The woman in azure was stunned. However, it was already too late for her to pull back, and her slender hand collided with Ling Han’s fist.

Peng!

There was a loud thud, and both of them stumbled back.

This woman was at the late stage of the Sun Moon Tier. However, she wasn’t a star genius, so her power was on the same level as Ling Han’s. Yet, Ling Han had unleashed the power of heavenly tribulation, so the destructive power of his fist was far more astonishing. The slender hand of the woman in azure instantly became red and bloodied.

“Who would’ve thought? Grandmaster Ling is actually a cultivation elite as well!” the woman in azure exclaimed. She channeled a cultivation technique to stop her blood. There was a hint of surprise on her face, though she wasn’t panicked.

“However, since this is Milady’s wish, it’s best that Grandmaster Ling obediently complies!”

Her eyes widened slightly.

Weng!

Two Suns and Moons materialized behind her. However, they radiated an eerie cold, not a brilliant warmth. Ice and snow instantly formed in the surroundings.

Suns and Moons merely looked like the sun and moon in the sky.

However, some people practiced ice-element cultivation techniques, and thus their Suns and Moons naturally radiated with a bone-chilling cold.

She had unleashed her Suns and Moons!

Ling Han nodded in his mind. Sure enough, the overall level of cultivation on this planet was higher than on the Joint Peace Planet. At least, he had only ever seen Venerable Trinity unleashing his Eternal River in the galaxy that the Joint Peace Planet belonged to. As for the others, they only knew how to unleash their power, not how to unleash their Mountains and Rivers or Suns and Moons.

Anyhow, the bone-chilling cold of her aura was almost about to freeze Ling Han’s blood and body.

However, this wasn’t enough to defeat him!

Zi!

A dense web of lightning instantly erupted from his body, pushing the icy aura nine meters from his body.

“Ice spear!” the woman in azure cried softly. A vast amount of icy air condensed to form an ice spear that measured around three meters in length. The ice spear viciously stabbed at Ling Han, and as it did so, whirls of frosty wind transformed into countless menacing ice blades.

Ling Han tapped a finger in the air, and a profound sword intent that was imbued with the power of lightning surged toward the ice blades.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The ice blades shattered into pieces.

Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back, and asked, “Are you done yet?”

The woman in azure brandished her ice spear, and replied, “No!”

She charged over again, relentlessly stabbing with her spear, and even using it as a staff. Under the effects of her martial intent, streaks of divine patterns materialized on her ice spear, intertwining to form a brilliant glow.

Ling Han humphed, and unleashed his full battle prowess. His fists continued to pummel the ice spear.

Ka, ka, ka!

Cracks started to appear on the ice spear, and after suffering yet another heavy blow, it finally shattered into pieces. Meanwhile, the woman in azure’s face was as white as a sheet. Her hair was disheveled, and she no longer appeared as beautiful and charming as before.

She couldn’t help but feel shocked. Ling Han was only at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, yet he was actually able to defeat her head-on. His strength was far too astonishing! However, she wasn’t willing to admit defeat. She retrieved a divine seal, and was just about to slap it onto her body.

“Qing Luo, enough!” An enchanting voice traveled out from the carriage. The owner of this voice was none other than the head of the Treasure Forest Pavilion’s Big Trade City branch, Lin Yuqi.

A fragrant breeze blew over, and the door to the carriage opened, revealing a breathtaking beauty. Her figure was perfect, and one couldn’t help but become lost in fantasies upon seeing her. Moreover, it was clear that this woman knew how to take full advantage of her charm. She wasn’t just standing there. Instead, her slender figure was leaning slightly such that the curves of her body were all accentuated to the extreme.

Her beauty was truly intoxicating.

“Grandmaster Ling, I’m not some terrifying beast. Are you afraid I’ll bite?” she said with a soft laugh. She was as beautiful as a blossoming flower in the wind.

Hearing her say this, Ling Han naturally couldn’t ignore her and leave anymore. He smiled, and said, “Does Milady have something to tell me?”

“Let’s get on the carriage first,” Lin Yuqi said with a charming smile.

Ling Han hesitated briefly before nodding and following her to the carriage.

Ling Yuqi turned around the entered the carriage first. She was wearing a red dress that hugged her figure tightly, and standing behind her, Ling Han could clearly see her willowy hips swaying back and forth. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Meanwhile, her curvaceous bottom was also tightly hugged by her dress. He could see it swaying with each step she took, and it was truly mesmerizing enough to make one drool with lust.

Ling Han had seen his fair share of beauties. Moreover, in terms of charm, Empress Luan Xing was 10 times more enchanting than her. However, in terms of knowing how to display one’s beauty in the most seductive and provocative method, this woman definitely took the crown.

Even he didn’t dare to look too much. He was afraid that he would become too aroused.
