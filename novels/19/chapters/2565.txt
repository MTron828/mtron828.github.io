Chapter 2566: The sixth opponent

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The sixth opponent was different. This signified that Ling Han had officially entered into the process of attempting for the title of Blood Martial King.

In the Celestial King Graveyard, all cities were strictly controlling the title of Blood Martial King. It would not easily be obtained, which truly turned it into a kind of supreme honor. In this manner, once a Blood Martial King appeared, he would win over full rows of spectators.

Thus, the tournament authorities arranged a suitable opponent for Ling Han only after serious selection.

Before this, even Tang Yuan had not managed to get wind of the slightest bit of information. He had completely no idea who would be Ling Han’s opponent this time round.

“On the black side, it is a rookie that has just recently emerged in our Tournament of Death, Li Long!” The commentator began to loudly praise. “According to the data I have obtained, Li Long is a disciple of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy. He has been punished with being exiled here due to killing another disciple.”

Killing a fellow disciple was an extremely serious crime, but when the commentator’s words fell, everyone was cheering in excitement, as if they considered Ling Han a hero.

Who among the people here had never committed a crime?

Whoever was fiercer and eviler and whoever was crueler would be able to win respect. Though Ling Han’s crime was not so heavy to the point that it was intolerable, it still made everyone “look highly” upon him.

This guy had good prospects.

“And now, Li Long has already won five times in a row, and entered the stage to contend for the title of Blood Martial King, and today, this is the first barrier that he will have to face.

“Can he really defeat his opponent decisively and easily with a single punch like he has the last five times?

“Let us wait and see!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The commentator paused slightly, then raised his voice once more, and shouted loudly, “And now, let us reveal the identity of the sniper! And that is… Sai Ang!”

Boom

, instantly, everyone’s emotions exploded.

“Sai Ang! Sai Ang! Sai Ang!”

They all called out loudly. At the beginning, it was still chaotic, but very quickly, it became a call of unison, neatly coordinated and like a clap of thunder, bearing extremely astonishing intimidation.

It looked like this Sai Ang was quite popular.

“Let the cheering become even more intense, and bring out our sniper!” The commentator seemed to have gone mad. “On the red side, Sai Ang, a warrior who has once achieved eight successive wins!”

Peng!

A figure directly leaped in from outside the passage of the tournament ground, landing heavily on the ground, and throwing dust into the air.

This was a Third Heaven Celestial King. It was only his first sniping battle, and the tournament authorities had not placed such high importance on Ling Han that they would directly mobilize a Fourth Heaven Celestial King.

Sai Ang was a blue-eyed, blond man, his body extremely sturdy and muscular, his arms and thighs bared. It could be seen that his complexion was very fair, but he was covered with golden pore hairs, giving off the feeling of a gorilla.

He was very showy as he showed off his muscles continuously to the spectators. In fact, he even lifted his top, causing the women on the spectators’ seats to erupt in a series of shrill screams.

After causing a small climax, Sai Ang exclaimed softly. A silvery light rose from his body, and his whole person actually sank into a silver suit of battle armor, instantly becoming a small giant that was nine meters tall.

The tournament allowed the use of Battle Armor, Celestial Tools, and other objects as long as there was a gap of just a single cultivation level.

Boom, the cheers were about to send the roof flying.

“Hehe, it really is unexpected that the tournament authorities would actually take such serious notice of this brat, sending Sai Ang in his first battle,” Zhao Shuang said, smiling slightly. He turned towards Tang Yuan. “Do you dare to make another bet?”

Tang Yuan was also slightly serious. Though this Sai Ang had only attained eight successive wins, he had achieved eight wins in a row as many as over 30 times. This kind of battle merit was extremely amazing, or there would have been no way that he would have such great popularity.

Furthermore, Sai Ang himself was a Third Heaven monarch tier, and added with the help of the Battle Armor, his battle prowess naturally would be lifted another level. Even some Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings would not be a match for him.

“What is it? Scared?” Zhao Shuang taunted. “You have so little confidence in your own subordinate?”

A profligate young master like Tang Yuan naturally could not tolerate this. Immediately, he raised his head high, and declared, “What would I be scared of? I’m still betting three Brahman Celestial Flowers!”

“Sure!” Zhao Shuang laughed loudly. This was just the opportunity for him to win back the stakes that he had previously lost. “Tang Yuan, you had best pray that this brat would be able to keep his life after this.”

Tang Yuan humphed. “It is still undecided who would be killing whom. Let’s just wait and see.”

“Hahahaha!” Zhao Shuang laughed loudly. He felt that he was certainly going to win this time round.

On the other side, the commentator said a few words, completely igniting the emotions of the spectators, and then said, “And now, let the battle begin!”

“Hahahaha, brat, have you washed your neck clean? Have you booked your coffin?” Sai Ang laughed loudly, showing incredible arrogance. “Any other last words you want to leave? I am a very reasonable person.”

Ling Han smiled slightly, and stretched out his right hand, crooking a finger at Sai Ang.

This provocative action immediately drove the people on the spectators’ seats mad. A great many people switched to supporting Ling Han, and began calling out “Li Long, Li Long.”

“You dare to snatch my popularity!” Sai Ang was infuriated, and with a bounce of his foot, the colossal object that was the Battle Armor immediately rushed towards Ling Han.?Shua, a sword actually appeared in the hand of the Battle Armor, but it was not an actual object. Instead, it was made up of light.

This was called a Particle Sword, and Ling Han had heard about it from Wally. It was an object of pure energy, possessing frightening destructive power. In this aspect, it was not inferior to any Celestial Tool.

Furthermore, a Particle Sword was not a solid object, and was not so easily parried. Thus, it was very hard to deal with.

Previously, though Yang Zhixuan had also possessed Battle Armor, he did not have equipment like a Particle Sword, so it was clearly inferior to this Battle Armor of Sai Ang.

From the very start, Sai Ang was using the Battle Armor and Particle Sword, clearly showing that he intended to settle this quickly.

Ling Han had no lack of understanding of Battle Armor. This kind of thing possessed very strong recovery abilities. He could either burst out with power that was strong enough to destroy it completely, or he could only slowly wear it down to the point that the energy of the Battle Armor was completely exhausted.

Otherwise, the side possessing the Battle Armor would be completely unbeatable.

Ling Han naturally would not choose the second option. He balled his hand into a fist, and then also leaped forth, going forward to greet Sai Ang.

Peng!

Ling Han’s speed was even higher, with him arriving first though he had started out later. His fist landed onto the chest portion of the Battle Armor, and with a wave of his right hand, his strike landed on the left wrist of the Battle Armor, easily pulling out the Particle Sword.

Sai Ang was shocked. He had not expected that Ling Han could be so fast, and his power was also very amazing. Even if Sai Ang was boosted with the Battle Armor, it was still no match for the power of a mere wave of Ling Han’s hand. However, Sai Ang immediately smirked coldly because this Battle Armor was not what it had been before.

Recently, he had spent an exorbitant sum to upgrade this Battle Armor. It was no longer a Three-Star Battle Armor, but was rather Four Stars, which could assist a Fourth Heaven Celestial King in battle.

He was unable to fully unleash the might of the Battle Armor, but in terms of defense, it would be very hard for even a peak-stage Fourth Heaven Celestial King to pose a threat to the defenses of the Battle Armor. Naturally, there was no need for him to worry then.

This was a secret. He had not told anyone, because he was ambitious, and was not satisfied with just playing the role of a sniper. He wanted to attempt achieving the honor of Blood Martial King. In that way, with every battle he fought, the fees paid for his appearance would be multiplied a good few times over.

‘You want to penetrate my Battle Armor? You must really be dreaming!’

Crack, crack, crack, crack.

However, before he even finished his thought, he suddenly heard the sound of breaking from his Battle Armor. It was incredibly sharp to his ears.

Boom, the spectators on the seats had gone absolutely crazy. What had they seen?

Sai Ang’s Battle Armor had been directly punched through with a single punch from Ling Han!

That guy was really too barbaric, directly taking apart a Battle Armor with bare hands.

Gods!
