3103 Two Meridians

“You’re very good.” Sun Jianfang nodded and smiled. He raised his hand and took out another fruit. “I’ll give you another Meridian Guiding Fruit. I’ve always been fair and just in meting out punishments and granting rewards where it’s warranted.”

It was a pleasant surprise.

Ling Han hurriedly took it. This was a gift that would make him rich, so how could he refuse?

Moreover, if the Meridian Guiding Fruit was consumed directly, the effects would be too poor, and it could only be consumed by one person, but it would be different if it was refined into the form of alchemical pills. With Ling Han’s skill in alchemy, refining six to eight pills would definitely not be a problem.

He was contributing to the Ancient Dao Sect.

“This time, I’ll give you 20 days before I conduct another inspection.” Sun Jianfang waved his hand, indicating that Ling Han could leave.

“Wait…” he spoke again. “Don’t let anyone know about your cultivation progress. If anyone asks, tell them that you only sensed your first meridian 20 days later.”

“Yes.” Ling Han nodded. He knew that Sun Jianfang wanted him to hide his ability. After all, humans were unpredictable, and not everyone wanted to see him mature and grow.

Actually, even without Sun Jianfang’s warning, Ling Han had no intention of telling anyone about his advancement—if others knew all about him, how could he trick them in the future?

He returned to his residence, and found the Three Elements Formation’s formation foundations. Then, he ran to the place where he had refined alchemical pills. After setting up the formation, he quickly refined the Meridian Guiding Fruit into alchemical pills.

This time, there were six pills. It was slightly worse than the last time.

Ling Han was not discouraged. The success rate of pill completion would naturally fluctuate. One more or one less pill was completely within the normal range.

Only by improving his skills would he be able to further increase the success rate of the pills.

This could only be done slowly. Besides, producing six or seven pills in a single cauldron was already quite a lot.

Because he still had quite a few jade seeds, Ling Han was not in a hurry to sell the alchemical pills in his hands. He returned to his room, and used the optical computer to further understand this world better.

This computer could be seen as a neutered version of Wally.

‘I can’t let Wally know about this,’ Ling Han thought to himself. Otherwise, with his additional emotional function, he would definitely jump up and down in mad fury

This new world looked a little like the Ancient Realm. It was a vast galaxy filled with stars.

The planet he was on was known as Celestial Sea Planet. It belonged to the Centaur Galaxy[1]. There were a total of 11 planets like Celestial Sea Planet in this galaxy, and they revolved around a huge star.

Life had only evolved on Celestial Sea Planet. However, as the technological development of Celestial Sea Planet reached its heyday, it had once sent detectors to other planets, and made astonishing discoveries.

Ling Han saw a picture. It was a damaged building.

This had caused a sensation back then. Could it be that civilizations had appeared on other planets before?

However, before humans could explore further, a drastic change occurred in the heaven and earth, and this matter was completely put on hold.

The problem of survival had not been solved, so how could they still be in the mood to explore the endless starry sky?

People guessed that there had to be other life forms and other civilizations in the endless universe. Perhaps one day, intelligent creatures with higher civilization levels would descend on Celestial Sea Planet.

“According to historical records, human civilization began 3,000 years ago, but now that heaven and earth[2] has changed drastically, many ancient buildings have appeared from underground. This means that the lifespan of human civilization is not as short as 3,000 years.

“But how did the civilization from 3,000 years ago get exterminated?

“Earthquake? Super tsunami? The bombardment of meteors from outer space?

“Before this, some people deduced that humans evolved from apes… Uh.” Ling Han touched his face, finding it a little hard to imagine himself with a sharp mouth, monkey-like cheeks, and hairy face.

“How did we get here?”

Ling Han turned off his optical computer. He knew how he had come here, but the question was, what was the origin of that Divine Stone?

Although Sun Jianfang said that he had brought it back from an ancient site, what about the details?

It was blank.

‘I’ll have to explore all of this myself.

‘What an interesting world. It’s a pity that Luan Xing, Big Brother, and Second Brother can’t come out. Otherwise, it would be so interesting to adventure in this world together.’

Ling Han was very well-behaved. His current strength was too low, and he needed to slowly grow in secret for now.

Every day, he would test his strength after completing his fist practice. From 250 kg, he would steadily increase. Soon, he passed the 300 kg mark, followed by 350kg and then 400kg.

400 kg of strength was the limit that even prodigies had to stop at. Throughout the 100-year history of the Ancient Dao Sect, no one had ever exceeded 400 kg of strength at One Meridian.

However, Ling Han was not satisfied. If he stopped here, then he could only be a so-called prodigy.

But he had always pursued his limits. 400kg?

No way!

Furthermore, Ling Han was very confident because he did not feel any pressure on his meridian, which meant that his meridian could still continue to grow wider.

450 kg, 500 kg!

On the 12th day after leaving Sun Jianfang, Ling Han reached 500 kg of strength.

This was extremely terrifying. One had to know that even an average Two Meridians would only have this bit of power. Ling Han was only in One Meridian, yet he was comparable to a Two Meridians. How could this not be shocking?

“I’ve really reached my limit. Right now, I can already feel a dull pain in my meridian. I can’t expand any further, or else I’ll only explode,” Ling Han said to himself. “Alright, I can start sensing the second meridian.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He chose to start practicing his fist technique early in the morning. He had to sense a new meridian, which could not be done in the Spirit Gathering Formation.

His first meridian was already filled with power, so he couldn’t pour in any more energy. Thus, the power that entered his body began to search for a new place to break through.

However, he did not manage to find such a breakthrough for the time being. The power clashed randomly within his body, making Ling Han feel extremely uncomfortable. With a whoosh, he violently spat out a mouthful of blood, feeling an incomparably uncomfortable sensation in his chest.

‘F*ck, this is killing me.’

Ling Han panted. He knew that he was a little too anxious.

Cultivation definitely could not be rushed. Otherwise, it would only result in madness.

‘I need to take my time.’

Ling Han adjusted his mentality, and once again began to practice the Four Directional Fists.

He still hadn’t consumed the Meridian Guiding Fruit, because he believed in his own ability.

The energy that had rushed into his body began to clash randomly again. Ling Han cleared his mind, allowing this energy to circulate, and searching for a breakthrough point.

This energy was like a small snake, slithering all over his body, and drilling into him until he felt more and more uncomfortable. However, Ling Han gritted his teeth and endured it, as if this body was not his, and he felt no pain.

After experiencing so many disasters and calamities, this was no big deal for him.

However, this state couldn’t be sustained for too long. The energy would definitely cause damage to his body.

When he was about to reach his limit, Ling Han’s body trembled slightly, and an extremely relaxing feeling rose within him.

Success!

He smiled. This power had finally found a breakthrough. It surged into his right ring finger, traveled along his arm to his shoulder, then up his neck, and stopped at the top of his right ear.

He had opened his second meridian, the Hand Shaoyang Three Burning Meridian.

Two Meridians.

Ling Han felt his entire body relax. A powerful force surged into his body, giving him a strong sense of power.

[1] Okay, it’s actually a star system, but let the author have his galaxy. I’m too lazy to wipe his butt, and besides, it may be another unscientific universe or just MC being clueless.

[2] You may realize by now, but “heaven and earth” is also a Chinese way of saying “world” in general.
