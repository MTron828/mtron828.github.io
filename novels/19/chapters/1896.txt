Solemn expressions instantly spread across the faces of Grandmaster Zi Cheng and the two other Four-Star Alchemists.

The higher the level of an alchemical pill, the more phenomena it would exhibit. In terms of four-star alchemical pills, their medicinal power transforming into the shape of a beast was an extremely normal phenomenon.

“No, this isn’t medicinal power transforming into the shape of a beast. Rather... this is a Celestial pill!” Alchemist Heavenly Heart immediately said. He was a life form that had been born from a Celestial pill, so he was extremely sensitive when it came to such alchemical pills.

Alchemist Zi Cheng and Alchemist Chu Ye were both given a fright. A Celestial pill that could exhibit the shape of a life form... This wasn’t an ability possessed by Four-Star Alchemists. Instead, this was an ability possessed by Five-Star Alchemists!

No, no, no... Even ordinary Five-Star Alchemists couldn’t achieve such a feat. Only those who had gathered countless years of experience and reached the pinnacle could achieve such a feat.

How could a Four-Star Alchemist achieve this?

However, a look of disappointment quickly spread across Alchemist Heavenly Heart’s face, and he said, “The medicinal power has indeed taken the shape of a beast. However, this isn’t a genuine life form. Instead, it’s born from some symbol that has been purposefully inscribed into the pill. It’s because of this that it appears like a genuine life form.”

He had initially thought that he had found a life form similar to himself. However, it turned out to be nothing more than a disappointment.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng reached over and channeled some kind of celestial technique. The small azure fox immediately reverted into an orb of energy.

This was a Celestial pill of gaseous form!

“Azure Cloud Pill!” the three alchemists exclaimed in unison as they exchanged a glance.

Among Four-Star alchemical pills, the Azure Cloud Pill was the easiest to refine. Thus, when trying to advance to become a Four-Star Alchemist, most alchemists would choose to refine the Azure Cloud Pill. However, regardless of how “easy” it was to refine, it was still a four-star alchemical pill.

“It was successfully refined less than one month ago.”

The three Four-Star Alchemists could naturally determine this with ease. If they couldn’t, they would be a failure of a Four-Star Alchemist.

It was clear that Lu Jin hadn’t found this alchemical pill from some random place, and then dishonestly claimed it as his own.

Alchemist Zi Cheng resealed the pill vial, and tossed it back to Lu Jin before saying, “This is indeed a four-star alchemical pill. Congratulations on becoming a Four-Star Alchemist, Brother Lu. This is great news for Alchemy City.”

He laughed heartily, and said, “Today is a day of two celebrations! Not only have we gained a new Four-Star Alchemist, but we’re also gaining a new and talented Holy Son.”

His reaction was extremely quick, and he more so mentioned Lu Jin’s breakthrough before Ling Han’s crowning. This was because he understood that by stepping forward now, Lu Jin was definitely targeting Ling Han.

Of course, to target a measly One-Star Alchemist and a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator as a Four-Star Alchemist was definitely overkill. In reality... Lu Jin was most likely targeting Alchemist Zi Cheng.

At their level, conflicts would appear extremely peaceful and calm on the surface. In reality, however, there would be shadows and projections of blades flittering around everywhere. Countless people might be affected.

Lu Jin waved his hand, and said, “Brother Zi Cheng, you’ve already been the chairperson for almost 300 billion years, right?”

Thump...

Alchemist Zi Cheng’s heart thumped upon hearing this, and his gaze instantly became intense. “Indeed. Your memory is fairly good.”

“According to the rules of Alchemy City, the position of chairperson needs to be changed once every 300 billion years,” Lu Jin said as he continued to stare at Grandmaster Zi Cheng. “I suggest that we immediately choose a Holy Son to become the successor!”

He was forcing Alchemist Zi Cheng to abdicate!

Alchemist Zi Cheng came to a sudden realization. No wonder Lu Jin had stepped forward with such conviction and resolution. As it turned out, he was targeting his position as chairperson!

Such a rule did indeed exist in Alchemy City. One could only act as Chairperson for 300 billion years. When the time came, they would have to abdicate and pass their position onto someone else. In reality, there were still around 250 million years until the time limit of 300 billion years. This was enough time for Alchemist Zi Cheng to nurture Ling Han.

Moreover, under normal circumstances, who would dare to challenge him and force him to choose a successor?

Alchemist Heavenly Heart and Alchemist Chu Ye didn’t give a toss about this, so Alchemist Zi Cheng could naturally take his time to make a decision. However, Lu Jin’s sudden advance to become a Four-Star Alchemist gave him the right to force Alchemist Zi Cheng to make a decision.

Why did he insist on doing this? One had to realize that even though he had become a Four-Star Alchemist, his status was still far inferior to that of Alchemist Zi Cheng. That being the case, why did he insist on offending Alchemist Zi Cheng?

This was because Lu Jin also had another identity—he was Lu Xianming’s master!

As such, his actions were indeed targeted at Ling Han. However, targeting Ling Han wasn’t his ultimate aim. Instead, the position of chairperson was his ultimate aim.

If they were to choose a Holy Son to become the successor now, this would naturally have nothing to do with Ling Han. After all, without completing this ceremony, he couldn’t be regarded as a Holy Son. That being the case, what right would he have to be considered?

Taking a step back, even if Ling Han had the right to be considered, how could he surpass the other Holy Sons?

He had only just become a One-Star Alchemist, so did he even know how to perform Spirit Refinement?

This was a vicious attack, and it was also an attack of extreme coincidence. If Lu Jin hadn’t coincidentally become a Four-Star Alchemist at this time, his threat would have been absolutely useless.

Anyhow, if one wanted to become a Holy Son, they would first have to receive acknowledgment from all of the Four-Star Alchemists. Thus, he only had to object to prevent Ling Han from becoming a Holy Son. At that time, Lu Xianming would have the greatest chance of becoming the successor.

For the sake of his disciple, and more so for the position of chairperson, Lu Jin was truly giving it his all.

“I have my own plans for selecting a successor!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said with displeasure.

Lu Jin had only just become a Four-Star Alchemist, yet Zi Cheng had already raised three Four-Star Alchemists! Thus, how could Alchemist Zi Cheng pay much attention to Lu Jin?

They were both Four-Star Alchemists, yet they were at different levels in terms of Spirit Refinement. Thus, the gulf between them was still extremely great.

“Heh, then I resolutely object to Ling Han becoming a Holy Son,” Lu Jin said with a shake of his head. “This young man is far too good at causing trouble. Not only has he killed two potential successors of Celestial King Tier forces, but he even forced Zhao Qingfeng to death just then, offending the Eternal Prosperity Sect in the process. If we elevate him to the position of Holy Son, won’t that be further provoking those Celestial Kings?”

This wasn’t untrue. However, the matter with Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng had already been almost completely resolved by Grandmaster Zi Cheng. Moreover, Zhao Qingfeng had been released by none other than Lu Jin. Now, however, he was shifting all of the blame onto Ling Han. He was truly shameless to the core.

Alchemist Zi Cheng’s expression darkened, and his look of displeasure became even more intense.

In fact, he wasn’t appointing Ling Han to the position of Holy Son out of self-interest. Otherwise, which of his three previous disciples hadn’t had the right to become his successor?

However, Lu Jin?

For the sake of his disciple, he was truly stooping as low as he could and giving up all face!

However, Lu Jin did indeed have a great advantage. As long as he didn’t agree, Ling Han could never become a Holy Son. As such, the power was in his hands. As long as he remained stubborn for 300,000,000 years, Alchemist Zi Cheng would eventually have to abdicate. At that time, it was extremely likely that Lu Xianming would become the successor.

Alchemist Zi Cheng gazed at Lu Jin, and Lu Jin gazed at Alchemist Zi Cheng. Their gazes were locked, and it was as if they were silently discussing something.

After a brief moment, Grandmaster Zi Cheng said, “After three years, we’ll pick a successor from among the Holy Sons and Holy Daughters.”

Hearing this, Lu Jin said, “I also agree to Ling Han becoming a Holy Son.”

The two powerful figures each took a step back to come to a compromise.

On the surface, it appeared as if Lu Jin had gained a significant advantage. After all, what could Ling Han do in a measly three years? Even if he stayed in a Time Cultivation Chamber every day, that would only be 300 years. How far could he grow? Could he compete with Lu Xianming?

Meanwhile, this was also the most time that Alchemist Zi Cheng could buy. If he asked for any more, he would be risking a significant increase in unpredictable variables.

Anyhow, Alchemist Zi Cheng had agreed to this time limit of three years because he was well aware of Ling Han’s comprehension ability in alchemy. Only he knew that Ling Han had already succeeded in performing Spirit Refinement!

After three years, Ling Han would most likely be a Two-Star Alchemist already. At the same time, he might have already reached the Second Refinement.

That being the case, he could then naturally compete with the other Holy Sons and Holy Daughters.
