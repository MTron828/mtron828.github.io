2886 Fei Bai Pig

Ling Han realized that he was really busy. How many times had he come here already?

He shook his head and began to pass through the earth. He first arrived at the second dimension, and then headed further underground. This was because the Empress had the Power of Dimension that he had left behind, and it could act as his guiding light.

The Empress was clearly still further underground. Could there really be a third dimension down there?

Although Ling Han had already guessed this, when this scenario really happened, he still found it somewhat unbelievable.

!!

Overlapping two dimensions already required several hundred Seventh Tiers to act simultaneously. As for three… Just how powerful would they need to be?

Ling Han didn’t dare to think about it. At the very least, even if all the elites present were to join forces, they wouldn’t be able to do it. Even Hysteria probably wouldn’t be able to do it. Otherwise, if it could already overlap dimensions, how could it not be able to conquer the Flaming Frost Realm?

Ling Han sped up, and he continued to dive downwards. The power of the Heavenly Venerable Tier surged, and all obstacles were unable to withstand a single blow from him, as if they were made from paper. He traveled like this for about 10 days.

Xiu! He broke through the last layer of the earth, and he appeared in a new world.

A tall mountain rose hundreds of thousands of meters high, and a crevasse was hundreds of thousands of meters deep. In the past, this had clearly been a sea, but now the seawater had evaporated, leaving behind only a huge sinkhole.

As expected, there was a third dimension here.

Ling Han sensed that this should also have been a high-level dimension in the past, but it was already dead now, and could only be identified based on the strength of the six fundamental powers. Of course, Ling Han could only sense one type of fundamental power now.

He quickly probed which direction he should head in, then spread out his body again, and sped forward.

After a few more days, a mountain range appeared in front of him, and the Empress was within these mountains.

Xiu! Ling Han’s figure descended, and he quickly found the Empress and Hu Niu.

“Ling Han!” Hu Niu jumped over first and hugged him. “You’re too bad. Niu’s head is about to burst open, but you don’t care at all. Niu is going to die of sadness.”

This little girl!

Ling Han didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He hugged the little girl, and said, “Alright, alright, aren’t I back now?”

“Then Niu wants you to kiss Niu 100 times— no, 1,000 times.” Hu Niu bargained, her big eyes blinking.

Ling Han was slightly embarrassed. It was not only the Empress and Hu Niu here, but also a large group of other people as well. It was fine if they kissed a few times, but kissing 100 or 1000 times was a little awkward.

“We’ll kiss when we get home,” he said to Hu Niu.

Only then did Hu Niu nod, beaming with joy. Sometimes, she was quite easy to pacify.

“What’s the situation?” he asked the Empress.

“A huge ore deposit has been discovered here. After all these years of mining, there isn’t much left, but the essence should still be here. Therefore, no one can mine it now. Everyone has an eye on it, and we’re going to have a fight over it,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “Who are the elites there?”

“There are quite a few Fourth Tiers, and even a few Fifth Tiers,” the Empress said solemnly.

Ling Han also frowned. He could deal with Fourth Tiers, but when it came to Fifth Tiers, he wouldn’t be able to deal with them even if he used the ninth-grade combination seals.

Unless…

With a sudden flip of her hand, the Empress took out several Great Herbs. “Over the years, we’ve also unearthed quite a few Great Herbs, so we’ve left some for you.”

“Ling Han, after you eat them, will you be able to reach the Third Tier?” Hu Niu asked.

Ling Han was originally at the peak stage of the Second Tier, and he had already strengthened his foundations previously. When pursued by Xin Qihu, he had even refined his power to an incomparably pure level. As long as he advanced his cultivation level a little further, he would be able to break through.

Perhaps it was just a matter of a few more Great Herbs.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I’ll try.”

If he advanced into the Third Tier, he would have the ability to fight against even Fifth Tiers. Of course, whether he could suppress them or not was another matter. After all, having Fifth-Tier battle prowess and crushing Fifth Tiers were two completely different matters.

“Yi, celestial maidens, this is…” Just as Ling Han was about to enter the new Celestial Guest Residence, he saw an imposing-looking man walk over with large strides. There was a gentle smile on his face, but it did not conceal the pride in the depths of his eyes.

Ling Han looked at the Empress, and asked, “Trouble?”

“Just go into seclusion. I’ll take care of it,” the Empress said indifferently, appearing to be completely unconcerned.

Ling Han nodded, and he instantly entered the Celestial Guest Residence with a flash.

“Wayaya, why don’t you ask Niu? Niu can take care of it too.” Hu Niu jumped around, appearing extremely displeased.

Only then did the Empress turn to look at the man. “It has nothing to do with you.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The man’s smile didn’t diminish, and he showed a caring expression. “I’m just worried that the two celestial maidens will be deceived by others.”

“Fei Bai Pig, you’re so annoying.” Hu Niu made a face at him.

“Celestial Maiden Hu, my name is Fei Baizhu,” the man corrected Hu Niu, but there was a smile on his face1. If Hu Niu was only beautiful, then as a dignified Fourth Tier, he would not take her seriously at all.

However, Hu Niu’s beauty was pure, natural, and not pretentious at all. This was incomparably rare.

Just look, what Heavenly Venerate would make faces?

She was the only one who looked fresh and refined.

And in the case of the Empress, besides being beautiful, she was also proud to the core. This was also her natural personality, which he liked.

“It’s still easier to remember Fei Bai Pig,” Hu Niu muttered, and then put her hands at her waist. “Yi, didn’t I tell you to get lost? Why are you still standing here? Do you want to snatch Niu’s meat?”

Her face was full of suspicion and vigilance, causing Fei Baizhu not to know whether to laugh or cry. He was a dignified Fourth Tier; did he have to snatch food from others?

“Don’t worry, Celestial Maiden Hu. I won’t snatch it from you,” he explained.

“You won’t snatch it, but you still want to eat it, right?” Hu Niu’s ability to reason was completely different from others. She couldn’t help but turn her body to the side to guard the food in her hand, as if a piece would be missing if someone just looked at it.

The Empress was impatient. “Fei Baizhu, you’re not welcome here. I’ve already said this many times.”

Fei Baizhu’s gaze turned cold. Initially, he didn’t mind taking things slowly. After all, Hu Niu and the Empress were a Fourth Tier and Third Tier. Being able to cultivate to such a height, and to be as beautiful as a fairy, each with their own unique characteristics, they naturally made his heart palpitate. Spending some time courting them would also be worth it.

Only such a dao partner was worthy of accompanying him in his long life. Otherwise, he would get sick of her sooner or later.

However, Ling Han’s appearance caused him to develop a strong sense of danger. If he were to slowly court them, then it might all be for naught.

...

“Alright then. Please be careful, Celestial Maidens. After all, the people here are complicated. If you encounter any danger, feel free to come to my base. I’ll definitely do my best to help.” He didn’t continue to pester them. Instead, a warm smile appeared on his face.

He turned around and left.

“What do you think he means by that?” Hu Niu asked the Empress.

“Who cares what kind of schemes he’s up to.” The Empress didn’t care. She sat down cross-legged, and closed her eyes to rest.

“Arrogant woman!” Hu Niu grumbled, and also sat down.
