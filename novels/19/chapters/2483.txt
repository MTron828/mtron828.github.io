Chapter 2484: Fighting Over the Celestial Tool ??

“The Regulations of Time!” a Celestial King said in a solemn voice. His expression was as grave as could be.

The other Celestial Kings remained silent. However, their eyebrows were also slightly raised in shock.

Even though all Regulations became equal at the Celestial King Tier, the Regulations of Time and the Regulations of Space still enjoyed a transcendent standing. This was mainly because they were extremely difficult to master. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could only peek at the secrets of these two types of Regulations if they ingested the necessary Celestial medicines.

The Regulation of Time was far too difficult to comprehend and master.

Yet, how had a measly First Heaven Celestial King mastered the Regulations of Time? Moreover, it was so powerful that it could even affect a Second Heaven Celestial King!

In the sky, the meteor descended at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. It was unfathomably slow. In fact, they had enough time to drag a bed over and take a hearty nap. They could then pack away the bed and calmly leave the area.

At this moment, Liu Xi’s agonized wails became slightly shrill and jarring.

He was clearly a Celestial King, yet he was wailing with such despair and grief even though he wasn’t in any immediate danger. Was this not a joke?

Meanwhile, Ma Dang trembled in apprehension. He finally understood that Ling Han’s strength couldn’t be estimated based on his cultivation level. Otherwise, he might truly be defeated by this newly advanced Celestial King.

He wore a solemn frown as he gazed at Ling Han. He then took a deep breath, deciding to unleash his true power.

At this moment, Liu Xi finally came to his senses. He immediately shut up. However, it was already impossible for him to feign unconsciousness. His face immediately became beet-red, and he felt as embarrassed and ashamed as could be.

...

The others could hold back their laughter, but Hu Niu was someone who didn’t abide by any rules. She immediately clutched her stomach in laughter. Moreover, her wanton laughter grew louder and louder.

“Great Earth Shatter, Eight Word Art!” Ma Dang said with a solemn humph. He finally unleashed his trump card. The earth instantly rumbled, and it was as if it were about to shatter. Countless earthen spikes also shot out from the ground, yearning to impale and kill Ling Han.

However, the first person to suffer the consequences was Liu Xi. He was completely unable to dodge. Even though he fully activated his defenses, how could he block a full-power attack of a Second Heaven Celestial King? His body was instantly impaled, causing blood to drench the surroundings. This was a bloody and brutal sight.

However, Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to this, allowing the earthen spikes to shoot over as they pleased. He remained calm and unmoving. With his current power, as long as he channeled the Regulations to protect his body, were the attacks of Second Heaven Celestial Kings not akin to child’s play?

He clasped his hands behind his back, smiling at Ma Dang, and saying, “Do you have a more powerful technique?”

“Great Earth Shatter, Celestial Bodies Descend!” Ma Dang roared.

Boom!

He unleashed another powerful attack, summoning celestial bodies that crashed down in an apocalyptic manner.

Ling Han smiled faintly as he launched a fist at the sky. Regulations fluctuated, and the celestial bodies all shattered in unison. They transformed back into Regulations, dispersing back into heaven and earth.

“Anything else?” he asked.

Ma Dang trembled slightly. ‘What the hell is wrong with this Celestial King? He’s as bloody powerful as a Third Heaven Celestial King!’

Even though he still had some trump cards, Ling Han had dealt with his previous attacks with far too much ease. Thus, Ma Dang couldn’t help but feel that his attacks would be useless, regardless of how many times he unleashed them. It was simply impossible to contain Ling Han.

Upon seeing Ma Dang stop, Liu Xi finally breathed a sigh of relief. He had truly been afraid that he would be killed by Ma Dang. After all, would you look! There were still numerous spikes piercing his body, and his blood was still flowing into the surroundings. He couldn’t be any more miserable.

Ling Han cracked a grin, and said, “It’s my turn now!” He ferociously summoned the Divine Demon Sword, tossing it forth like a throwing knife.

Pu!

As if ignoring time, as if transcending the notion of time, the Divine Demon Sword arrived before Ma Dang in a flash. It then pierced into his forehead, nailing him to death.

F*ck! A Second Heaven Celestial King had died, just like that?!

Would you look! Ma Dang’s eyes were still wide with shock and disbelief!

Indeed, who could believe this? A Second Heaven Celestial King had actually been killed in a single strike by a newly advanced Celestial King?

“Hmm?”

“Huh?”

“Aaah?”

The Third Heaven Celestial Kings all turned around to stare at Ma Dang. This naturally wasn’t because they were attracted by his manner of death. Instead, they were all staring at the sword embedded in his forehead.

“Celestial Tool!” they exclaimed.

They were all enticed by what they saw.

Expressions of greed washed over their faces, and they all immediately lunged at Ma Dang, fighting for the Divine Demon Sword.

The might of Celestial Tools was transcendent!

The Dark Frost Celestial King was especially fervent in his pursuit. He had suffered immensely at the hands of Celestial Tools. Moreover, if it hadn’t been for her Celestial Tool, he could have definitely suppressed Huo Furong. He wouldn’t have been obstructed by her, and he wouldn’t have lost his territory.

The other Celestial Kings had never possessed or perhaps even witnessed Celestial Tools before. Thus, they only had a general concept about its strength. As a result, even though they all rushed forward, no one was as fervent as the Dark Frost Celestial King. This was especially the case for the Ninth Descent Celestial King, who hung around at the very back. Even though he had only met Ling Han once before, he had a very deep understanding of this youth.

Ling Han smiled faintly.

Weng!

The Divine Demon Sword immediately awoke, unleashing a chilling light into the surroundings. At the same time, a murderous aura soared into the sky.

This was a vicious weapon!

Whoosh!

With a ring, the Divine Demon Sword immediately obliterated Ma Dang’s head. Radiating with a boundless glow of murder, it then turned to point at the group of Celestial Kings. Like a waterfall, celestial light came crashing down.

The Celestial Kings faltered for a moment before resuming their fight for the Celestial Tool again.

The more powerful the Divine Demon Sword was, the more they desired to obtain it.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The Divine Demon Sword unleashed its might, with its sword light searing as it swept through the surroundings. What did it matter that it was being attacked by numerous Celestial Kings? They were completely unable to block its might. Even though they were surrounding the Divine Demon Sword, they were completely unable to suppress it. This was akin to a group of ordinary mortals trying to stop a raging bull. How could they stop it? How?

“To defeat the enemy, defeat their general first!” a Third Heaven Celestial King said.

“Some of you go over to suppress that brat! Once he dies, the Celestial Tool will become masterless. At that time, it won’t be so difficult to obtain.”

“We vow to only fight for the Celestial Tool after the brat has been killed!”

The Celestial Kings reached a consensus. However, there was also an exception—the Ninth Descent Celestial King. He clasped his hands behind his back as he stepped back from the battle. He smiled, and said, “This wasn’t included in our alliance agreement. Please excuse me for not participating.”

The other Celestial Kings were all astonished upon hearing this. However, on second thought, it was definitely a good thing that there was one less competitor for the Celestial Tool.

Thus, they didn’t pay much attention to this. They continued their attempts to suppress the Divine Demon Sword. Meanwhile, two of the Celestial Kings charged toward Ling Han. One of them was none other than the Buddhist Cloud Celestial King.

This Celestial King couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. After all this commotion, it was ultimately still he who had to suppress Ling Han. That being the case, why had they wasted so much time and effort just then?

“Foolish brat, accept your death!” the obese Celestial King roared as he charged over. He summoned a Great Dao, using it as a demon-subduing staff as he smashed it down at Ling Han’s head.

“Let me deal with him!” Ji Wuming suddenly shouted. Without waiting for Ling Han’s reply, he had already charged over.

Weng!

A burst of celestial light shot into the sky. He also summoned his Celestial Tool.

In the past, this had only been an Immortal Weapon. However, following his advance to the Celestial King Tier, he naturally refined this sword into a Celestial Tool as well. Now, the might of the Divine Metal was fused with his martial intent, allowing it to unleash an unfathomable power.

The Buddhist Cloud Celestial King was astounded. This was another Celestial Tool?!

However, he was immediately overcome with wild joy. This brat had actively come over to gift him a Celestial Tool! Haha! He would gladly accept this offer!

The two of them instantly engaged in an intense battle.

In terms of strength, Ji Wuming was actually quite a bit weaker than Ling Han, with his Vitality Index only just passing 8000. However, once he summoned his Celestial Tool, things would be completely different.
