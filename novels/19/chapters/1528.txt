Chapter 1529 Further Provocation

There was a clear regulation in the martial arts academy—the residence of a disciple would be a forbidden area that was off-limits to all other disciples unless they received an express invitation to enter. Those who broke this rule would be punished. On the less severe end of the spectrum, they might be directly expelled from the academy. On the more severe end, however, they might have their cultivation crippled or even be executed.

Thus, the disciples of the academy were all extremely at ease. Their residences would be a safe harbor where they could peacefully cultivate.

However, this extremely strict rule was suddenly broken.

Three people barged into Ling Han’s residence, their demeanor ferocious and haughty.

Ling Han left his room, only to see that there were two men and one woman. Moreover, he recognized two of the three intruders. One of the men was Cai Miao, a big shot of the eighth campus. Meanwhile, the woman enjoyed an even higher status. She was Zhu Xiu’er, the wife of the Great Saint!

The last man was extremely young, and he was a youth in the truest sense of the word. He was only 20 or so years old, yet he had already reached the Mountain River Tier. This was quite astonishing. One had to realize that Ling Han had also only been at the Mountain River Tier when he was at the same age as him.

“Ling Han!” Zhu Xiu’er said coldly. She wore a menacing and hateful look as she pointed at Ling Han with her slender finger.

She had wanted to bring trouble upon Ling Han back then, and she had purposefully tried to help Gu Daoyi during the competition between the new disciples. However, the Great Saint had personally spoken and righted the record. That was equivalent to slapping her across the face. Although she had been furious at the time, did she dare to go against a Great Saint?

However, things were different now. Her son was being raised as the successor of the Great Saint, and she had more so educated him to be extremely obedient toward her. In fact, even the Great Saint didn’t dare to offend her. After all, could he abandon his son?

Thus, she was finally able to barge over and seek revenge.

This had been over a dozen years in the making, and she had also had to suppress her fury for this entire time.

Ling Han smiled as he clasped his hands and said, “Greetings, Saint Missus.”

This was standard etiquette, and he couldn’t give them more excuses to target him.

“You dare to remain standing after seeing the Saint Missus?” Cai Miao asked balefully. He had never forgotten Ling Han’s crime of breaking the tradition of the academy.

Meanwhile, Zhu Xiu’er stood tall and proud as she crossed her arms before her chest. She naturally had to exhibit her might as the Saint Missus.

Ling Han shook his head, and asked, “Which rule of the academy states that I have to kneel before the Saint Missus?”

“This isn’t a rule of the academy, but it’s the most basic etiquette. Do you dare to disrespect a Saint?” Cai Miao roared sternly.

Of the four big shots of the eighth campus, Yu Susu had always put her full concentration on studying formations. She hoped to become a Saint through formations. In fact, Ling Han had never even met her before.

Meanwhile, Ren Feiyun was on the side of Ling Han. Although Qi Tian was also a proponent of old traditions, he was far less extreme than Cai Miao. This was especially the case after he learned that Ling Han had even dared to argue with the Saint Missus. Upon learning of that, he gave up on trying to force Ling Han to lower his head.

Of the four big shots, only Cai Miao was insistent on dealing with Ling Han. However, Ling Han had always been in either the Black Tower or his own residence. Moreover, with his status, Cai Miao couldn’t stand guard outside Ling Han’s residence all day long, either. Thus, he had never found an opportunity to deal with him.

It was only now that he had finally found a great opportunity. The Saint Missus was personally visiting Ling Han to deal with him, and she was even bringing her son along with her. She and Cai Miao had instantly reached an agreement to barge over together.

Even if the sky fell, wasn’t the Saint Missus here to hold it up for him?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “My respect for Saints lies in my heart. I don’t need to act it out for others to see.”

“Pathetic sophism!” Cai Miao said with a cold humph. “Are you going to kneel or not?”

It was Ling Han’s refusal to crawl through the dog flap that had sparked all of this conflict in the first place. However, even the Saint Missus and the son of the Great Saint were present now. Could Ling Han still persist with his stubbornness?

Ling Han simply looked over to the young man. He was none other than the son and only child of the Star Sand Saint. At that time, he had still been a bratty child who cried for everyone to become his horsey. In fact, he had even been frightened by Ling Han. A dozen or so years had passed, and the bratty child of the past had already grown up to become a handsome and energetic young man.

He smiled, and said, “Young man, you are?”

A bashful smile appeared on the youth’s face, and he replied, “I’m Mi Xueming.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

‘So the Star Sand Saint’s surname is Mi.’

Ling Han involuntarily chuckled upon seeing his reaction. Back then, this Mi Xueming had been a bratty child who had even used a Heavenly Body Tier cultivator as his horse. Upon seeing the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he had even insisted on having her become his wife. Yet, he was acting all shy and bashful now?

It was very likely that the Star Sand Saint had taught him well. Descendents of genuinely powerful clans were indeed proud, but this pride was usually hidden within their mind. From the outside, they would appear especially cordial and easy-going.

“Ling Han!” Zhu Xiu’er and Cai Miao roared in unison. He was acting far too arrogant! He had actually ignored both of them!

“Detain him!” Zhu Xiu’er was finally unable to contain her fury any longer. Ling Han had acted in an identical manner back then, completely ignoring her words. In her eyes, all she wanted was some face. Was it that difficult for him to lower his head toward her?

Cai Miao sneered coldly. With the Saint Missus present, who would dare to obstruct him?

Ren Feiyun wouldn’t dare, and the Tranquil Heart Saint would most likely also turn a blind eye. After all, he wouldn’t dare to challenge the actions of the Saint Missus, would he?

Xiu!

A fragrant scent breezed over as Empress Luan Xing and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden appeared beside Ling Han.

The Empress peered down at Zhu Xiu’er. She was an incredibly proud individual, and she couldn’t care less about Zhu Xiu’er being the Saint Missus or whatnot. Anyone who dared to disrespect her husband was as good as provoking her might. Moreover, her fury was enough to make wind and clouds lose color.

Gasp!

Zhu Xiu’er couldn’t help but widen her eyes in astonishment upon seeing the Empress. In fact, even her breathing stopped for a second. How could there be such a beautiful woman in the world?

From her appearance to her physique, and also to her demeanor... Every single aspect of her being was indescribably perfect.

“How audacious!” the Empress roared as she rose three meters into the air. She pointed down at Zhu Xiu’er and the others, and said, “You dared to disrespect my husband? Have you people become tired of living?”

Zhu Xiu’er finally regained her senses upon hearing this, and rage instantly spread across her face. This b*tch actually dared to scold her! Moreover, she had purposefully risen three meters into the air! Just how much contempt did she hold for them?

She also hovered into the air, rising three meters above Empress Luan Xing. “Are you not going to kneel and greet this Saint Missus?!”

Ling Han smiled before pulling the Empress down and into his embrace. “There’s no need to argue with this type of person. It’s not worthwhile.”

“Mh-mm!” The Empress smiled sweetly as she replied with a gentle nod.

‘F*ck!’

Cai Miao’s eyes were red with jealousy. Even though he viewed himself as a supreme prodigy, and even though he only had cultivation on his mind, his heart still swayed when he saw the stunningly beautiful Empress. In fact, he could barely control himself. However, such a beautiful and noble celestial maiden was actually acting all sweet and gentle as she rested in Ling Han’s embrace? The sight of this was like having knives plunged into his heart!

“Humph! You’ve disrespected the traditions, and you’ve even dared to talk back to the Saint Missus. Obediently bow down and accept your crimes!” Cai Miao finally lashed out at Ling Han.

“You dare?!” The Empress’ gaze became sharp, and she immediately leaped forward to block Cai Miao’s attack.

Boom!

A devastating aura burst into the surroundings. This was the unique and overwhelming might of her Divine Fetus. Its effects were similar to Ling Han’s heaven’s might in that it could prevent others from unleashing their full power.

Such was the Empress’ power that even the big shots wouldn’t dare to underestimate her!

Cai Miao didn’t want to battle against the Empress, yet she left him with no option but to do so. He immediately altered his attack to grab at her. In any case, this presented a good opportunity for him. If he wanted to conquer this noble and proud woman, the first step would be to shatter her pride.

How would he shatter it? With strength, of course!

The Empress smiled balefully as a brick appeared in her hands.
