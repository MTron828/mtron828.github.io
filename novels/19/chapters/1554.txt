Chapter 1555 Battling Chi Huangji again

Chi Huangji, a prodigy of the Netherworld. He was indeed an incredibly powerful king tier, and in a battle of equals, he was in fact capable of suppressing the North Emperor and Stone Emperor!However, when they had been at the Mountain River Forest, Chi Huangji had still lost to Ling Han in the end. Though his gains were not any less because of it, it had still left an ugly mark on his experience.

He had brooded on it all this while, but with the Immortal Realm and Netherworld being far apart from each other, he naturally could not possibly seek out Ling Han again for another battle, and erase this humiliation.

At the time, Wu Jue had been lost, and the Chaotic Demon Palace had mobilized a great amount of manpower to launch a search for him. Later, Wu Jue had been found, and some promising saplings had also been brought back.

Chi Huangji was among those that had been brought back.

He was indeed a prodigy. In merely slightly over a century, he had already advanced into the Eternal River Tier, and had even reached the medium extreme. Even in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, this kind of natural talent was one of the very best.

Chi Huangji had never imagined that he would actually meet Ling Han in this place.

“Yo, it’s been a long time!” Ling Han waved at Chi Huangji, and was not concerned that the secret of him being from the Immortal Realm would be leaked out.

The Hysteria Demon Master clearly knew who he was, yet he did not say anything. Then, as long as this Demon Master did not make a move, what need was there for him to take others to heart?

Chi Huangji clenched his teeth. He had never thought that Ling Han would be so outrageously bold to actually run into the Netherworld. Furthermore, he actually managed to perfectly fit into the Netherworld. If he had not seen him with his own eyes, even if others pointed at Ling Han and exclaimed that he was a spy from the Immortal Realm, he would not have believed it.

He wanted very much to leap over and fight Ling Han to his heart’s content, but when he saw the Hysteria Demon Master standing at the side, he hurriedly exclaimed, “Master, this person is from the Immortal Realm, and has hidden his identity with some unknown means!”

‘What?!’

Hearing these words, those who had come out to receive them all paled in shock. This was actually a spy from the Immortal Realm?

Ling Han coughed, and said, “Chi Huangji, you can eat whatever you like, but you can’t say whatever you like! Just look at me; what part of me looks like someone from the Immortal Realm?”

“Humph, don’t forget, we have met before at the Two Realm Battlefield over 100 years ago, and have even fought! Don’t tell me that I can’t even distinguish whether you are from the Immortal Realm or Netherworld?” Chi Huangji sneered.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’. “Are you talking about the time that you lost to me?”

Everyone heard this, and once again erupted in uproar.

Chi Huangji actually lost? No way, though this junior brother was a newcomer, his talent was indeed shocking. He had been claimed to be a second Mo Li, and even if he couldn’t become a Demon Master in the future, it was highly possible that he could cultivate to the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, and become a Demon Master in another sense of the word!

Surely Ling Han’s cultivation level had been higher at the time, and he had won on the basis of his advantage in cultivation level. That had to be it.

Chi Huangji looked both humiliated and angry, and said, “That was because my cultivation level had been forcibly reduced to the Mountain River Tier. If I could use my full abilities, I would be able to suppress you with a single finger.”

Uh!?

Everyone couldn’t help but wear strange expressions. Hearing the tone that Chi Huangji had said these words in, it clearly was he that had had the advantage in cultivation level at the time. F***, just who exactly was this young man? That was really too amazing, wasn’t it?

Ling Han roared with laughter, and said, “Then, let’s have a spar.”

Yet Chi Huangji humphed coldly. “Don’t think of changing the topic! You are clearly of the Immortal Realm, yet enter into our Netherworld. What are you planning?”

The Hysteria Demon Master finally spoke up. “Since he has entered into our Netherworld, and gained the approval of the Regulations of our Netherworld, Ling Han is a man of our Netherworld! Never speak of this topic again.”

This was the will of a Demon Master. Once the words were out, the whole world would obey!

“Yes, Master.”

“Yes, Lord Demon Master.”

Everyone all obeyed seriously. Though Chi Huangji was defiant, he could only nod obediently.

However, the Demon Master merely said that there should not be any bother about Ling Han’s previous identity, but did not say that they could not fight him.

“Ling Han, then let’s fight again!” Chi Huangji leaped out. He had gained much of the Hysteria Demon Master’s fondness and regard. Thus, he could do some matters that other disciples did not dare, such as issue a challenge right in front of the Demon Master.

This time, the Demon Master did not stop them. He merely smiled at Ling Han, and said, “Have a fair battle.”

Ling Han knew what he meant. If he used his full effort, with 11 killing formations activating at the same time, even Mo Li would be having a headache, so what more Chi Huangji? Thus, in a “fair” battle, the killing formations naturally could not be used.

This was in fact very unfair. Being able to inscribe the killing formations was because Ling Han had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and his physique was strong enough. The ability had not just come out of nowhere.

However, Ling Han did not mind. In a battle of equals, he was still incapable of winning? That has got to be a joke.

“Fine, we’ll have a fair battle,” Ling Han said, smiling.

“Then let’s go up into the skies for a battle.” Chi Huangji took the lead in charging up into the skies.

Ling Han lazily floated up into the skies as well. In a battle of equals, he did not even take seriously rank three king tiers, unless they had come from the Forbidden Lands, and cultivated celestial techniques. Otherwise, they would not be capable of matching him at all.

However, if it really came to that, he would activate the 11 killing formations, and would still be able to deal with everything.

Having cultivated the highest level of cultivation technique like the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, would he still be unable to sweep aside all opposition in the same cultivation level?

What a joke!

“Sister, have some melon seeds.” When Wu Jue saw that the irksome presence had left, he hurriedly came over to curry favor, and those who were watching his actions were completely dumbfounded. They had never seen their little master so eagerly trying to attract someone’s affection.

Even the Demon Master’s lips were twitching. This guy had never acted so filial even to him!

Everyone turned to look at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and felt that though this woman was very beautiful, she was not so beautiful that she could completely enchant and captivate both the mind and spirit. At least there was definitely one or two that could match her in looks in this galaxy, so how was it that she had caused their little master to act like a completely different person?

Yet they did not know that when Wu Jue was still a child, it was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden who had taken great care of him, so the impression she left on him was naturally incomparably deep. How could just any woman replace her in his heart?

In the skies, Chi Huangji glared coldly at Ling Han, his expression solemn. This opponent that he had once been able to crush to death with a single hand had actually caught up with him in cultivation level; this was really inconceivable.

He had gained the careful guidance of a Demon Master, and added with the fact that his own good fortune was so unnatural that he could simply pick up any natural treasures wherever he went, it was unimaginable that Ling Han actually managed to catch up to him in cultivation level.

Multiple demonic patterns lit up on Chi Huangji’s arms. He had absolute confidence that he needed not fear anyone and could easily suppress any opponent in a battle of equals.

With a sudden roar, he charged out to attack Ling Han. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ling Han was very casual. Even if he did not use the killing formations, merely the strength of his defense was not something that Chi Huangji could penetrate. Even if he did not resist, and allowed Chi Huangji to melt him down through his power of Regulations, that would need at least a good few days to actually be capable of causing him some injury.

He raised his hand, and multiple patterns similarly lit up. What was strange was that they were not divine patterns, and were not demonic patterns, either. Instead, they seemed to be a combination of both, yet in terms of level, they seemed to be higher.

“Yi!” The Hysteria Demon Master couldn’t help but be slightly surprised. The might of such patterns would naturally collapse at the first blow in his eyes, but if he was also pulled down to the Eternal River Tier, then the demonic patterns he showed would still be unable to match them.

This brat... was very strange!
