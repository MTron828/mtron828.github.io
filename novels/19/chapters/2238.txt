Chapter 2239: The various forces

“Hehe, as expected of Brother Meng. Even this hasn’t been able to deceive you.” WIth a laugh,?boom, a star suddenly exploded into bits, and a young man walked out from within.

Compared to the star, he was naturally negligible in size, but the aura he exuded far surpassed that, as if he was a giant that supported the heavens.

“Liu Sanbian!” Meng Feicheng’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“I thought that my Concealing Heaven and Earth Mystical Power had already reached a great height, but I never thought that Brother Meng would still see through it. You truly are amazing!” the young man, Liu Sanbian, said smilingly, but though his smile was very calm, it emanated a coldness, and was filled with wariness against Meng Feicheng.

He was filled with confidence in his concealment technique, and thought that only Ascending Origin Tiers would be able to discover his presence, yet Meng Feicheng had easily seen through it, which naturally filled him with killing intent.

Yet Meng Feicheng smiled calmly, and said, “You’re wrong. I have merely made a deduction based on your personality, and assumed that someone like you would definitely have hidden himself in the shadows to take advantage of a crisis for personal gain, and just drew you out. I had not expected that you really had been there.”

‘This…!’

Involuntarily, Liu Sanbian’s expression turned ugly. He had actually been drawn out. This Meng Feicheng was really too despicable.

His battle prowess was not the slightest bit inferior to that of Meng Feicheng and the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan, but because of his personality, he had always preferred to take advantage. Yet now, Meng Feicheng had drawn him out ahead of time, which made him feel extremely pissed.

“The Nine Brother Tigers of the Chang Clan, shall we first work together, and chase Meng Feicheng off?” he suggested.

They would not dare commit murder. Meng Feicheng had a powerful background. His master was the Forever Sword Celestial King, and it was rumored that he had achieved Dao through his Divine Sword. In terms of strength, he could rank in the top 10 even among Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

If Meng Feicheng was killed, this Forever Sword Celestial King would definitely not give up the matter, and would shake even the Clear Heaven Pass. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sure,” the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan agreed.

“To avoid any sudden changes, why don’t we move immediately?” Liu Sanbian asked smilingly.

As time passed, who knew if there would be more elites coming here, and the power of Regulation that everyone could use was limited. Even if they now knew that the beast meat here could replenish their power of Regulation, how much could they actually prepare beforehand?

They had to occupy this place as soon as possible, and make that a fact.

Meng Feicheng laughed loudly, and said, “Before that, the Liu Clan, as well as the nine members of the Chang Clan, don’t you think we should first get rid of this outsider?”

“He is just a First Secret,” Liu Sanbian immediately declared disdainfully. “Meng Feicheng, you are really falling farther and farther behind, being wary of even a First Secret?”

“This man is not that ordinary,” Meng Feicheng said. “At the very least, I have not been able to kill him with a single strike.”

This man was really quite harsh. To get rid of Ling Han, he actually willingly slapped himself in the face. Of course, this was not a painful strike, but it was still a blow to his pride, after all.

“En?” The Nine Tigers of Chang Clan and Liu Sanbian all fixed their eyes on Ling Han, a strange look on their faces.

“Who cares if this brat is really all that strong? Since he is an outsider, we should first get rid of him, and talk of other things,” Liu Sanbian immediately declared.

“This is our territory, and even an outsider wants a share of the loot?” The Nine Tigers of Chang Clan smirked coldly. “There is no sign of them in the resistance against the Foreign Realm, and now that there are benefits to be had, they have all come over. How could there be such a good thing!”

Ling Han naturally was cursing Meng Feicheng in his heart. Ling Han actually had planned to take advantage of their internal strife, but had not thought that Meng Feicheng would be so malicious, dragging him into the matter as well, and as the one to bear the brunt at that.

However, he naturally would not be showing weak morale, and said, “Don’t speak of yourselves in such a noble manner. With the invasion of the Foreign Realm, there is no possible way that anyone beneath the Celestial King Tier could match them, and they would only be dying for nothing. Furthermore, generations and generations of Celestial Kings would ultimately come here, and wouldn’t it be for nothing else but to contribute their own power for the sake of the Celestial Realm?

“Instead, it is you people that only know to boast about the past glories of your ancestors, while you yourselves will only contend fiercely for your own pride, which is absolutely useless!”

With these words, Meng Feicheng and the others all bore menacing looks.

As they saw it, Ling Han’s only reaction was to flee in a panic. In truth, they did not have such strong intentions to kill Ling Han, and merely wanted to scare him off. It was definitely impossible that they would pursue him to kill him. How could they possibly take to heart such a minor character?

But Ling Han actually dared to mock them, and this was unacceptable to them, even if what Ling Han said was completely true.

“What a toxic mouth.”

“You’re seeking death!”

They all spoke coldly, their gaze directed at Ling Han filled with killing intent.

Ling Han was unafraid, and stood with his arms crossed behind his back as he said, “Come, let me see what strength you so-called prodigies actually have.”

“Die!” Liu Sanbian was the first to move, sending out a palm strike. It turned into a massive millstone that descended on Ling Han. This blow was very frightening as the Regulations surged, and?peng, peng, peng

, the stars in the surrounding area all exploded one after another.

Ling Han used Void Space, and could advance and retreat with ease.

“Yi?” Liu Sanbian and the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan all looked astonished, shocked by the strength that Ling Han exhibited.

In their minds, since Liu Sanbian had already moved, that definitely would result in an easy capture.

…Meng Feicheng had indeed not spoken wrongly. This brat was quite strange.

“Then let us work together to get rid of this outsider that knows not what is good for him,” the Nine Tigers of Chang Clan declared, and the nine of them separated a bit, sealing off an angle.

Liu Sanbian and Meng Feicheng also sealed off an angle each, forming a triangular siege, while Ling Han was in the center.

Though they were bullying him with an advantage in numbers, and there was a great disparity in their cultivation levels, Meng Feicheng and the others did not show the slightest bit of embarrassment.

He was a mere First Secret, and there was no way that they would consider him a rival. In that case, it was naturally the sooner he was killed, the better, and then that they could focus their time on serious matters.

Boom!

The three sides moved at the same time, sealing off all routes of escape for Ling Han.

Ling Han’s left hand controlled Space, while his right hand manipulated Time. The two Regulations channeled, and Time and Space were immediately disturbed. He raised a foot, and disappeared from where he was standing. When he reappeared again, he was already incredibly far away.

“Regulations of Space!” Liu Sanbian’s brow creased into a frown.

The Regulations outside the Five Elements were all extraordinarily strong, and the Regulations of Space were one of the strongest among them.

“No, there are also Regulations of Time,” Meng Feicheng added.

At this, Liu Sanbian’s frown deepened even further. The Regulations of Time could be considered invincible against all opponents of equal cultivation level before the Celestial King Tier. In fact, it could completely transform a king tier, allowing his battle prowess to directly soar to the level of emperor tier.

Ling Han crossed his hands behind his back, appearing completely relaxed. “That is all your strength? Hehe, you are only?so?strong.”

“What boastful words!” Meng Feicheng and the others were all outraged, and moved once more.?Boom, divine chains immediately formed from various types of Regulations, spreading all over the space, and the Light of Dao exploded madly, shattering all the surrounding stars.

Ling Han chuckled, and only continuously channeled the Regulations of Time and Space, moving smoothly. He had absolutely no intention to take them head-on.

There was naturally no future to be had should he confront them head-on. There was no possible way he could match a Fifth Secret monarch tier, what more when it was equivalent to having three Fifth Secret monarch tiers now.

Meng Feicheng and the others all used various celestial techniques, wanting to suppress Ling Han or even kill him, yet could not even touch a corner of Ling Han’s robes.

They did not summon their Pseudo-Celestial Tools, because this would be an additional expense of their power of Regulation. Unless they had absolute certainty of a victory, this would only increase the expense of their power of Regulation. Additionally, a Celestial King Tier decree would not be of much use here, either, because this place restricted cultivation level. If they summoned a Celestial King Tier decree, it would be directly crushed and destroyed by the heaven and earth.

Ling Han naturally was absolutely calm and unhurried.
