3095 Meridian Guiding Fruit

“The Celestial Path is long, and its length is unknown. The difficulty of walking this path is unknown,” Sun Jianfang said.

Ling Han didn’t say anything, and only listened.

“The first step of cultivation is to use techniques to communicate with heaven and earth and extract the power of heaven and earth.” Sun Jianfang finally said something useful, confirming Ling Han’s conjecture that he could only cultivate for half an hour in the morning.

“The human body has a total of 12 true meridians. Opening them can fill one with power, allowing an ordinary person to have the ability to shatter rocks and crack pillars. In fact, according to ancient tales, there were great elites who could overturn rivers and seas. They were peerless.

“However, the first step is not to open the meridians, but to sense them first.”

Sun Jianfang paused for a moment, looked at Ling Han, and said, “Although the meridians of the human body are all marked in the diagram, this only tells you roughly where they are, and how you can sense them, but it still depends on you.

“Here, this is the Meridian Guiding Fruit.” He threw a crimson fruit at Ling Han, and a faint fragrance wafted out.

“After the drastic change in heaven and earth, there were many earthquakes, and many ancient buildings appeared. There were even mountains rising from the ground. Not only did they have inheritances, but they also had this kind of mysterious fruit.

“Consume it, and it can greatly increase the probability of you sensing your meridians.”

Ling Han accepted the Meridian Guiding Fruit, and a strange expression appeared on his face.

Should he tell the other party that he had already sensed one of his meridians and had experienced some success?

“Don’t underestimate this fruit. Our sect only has one Meridian Guiding Fruit Tree. It can only bear 10 fruits every year, but there are too many people who need it,” Sun Jianfang said solemnly. “If this fruit is sold outside, it’s worth at least 100 jade seeds!”

“Jade seed?” Ling Han heard another new term, and was extremely curious.

“The jade seed is the essence of jade. It contains some kind of energy of the heaven and earth. If you activate it with a Spirit Gathering Formation, you can release the energy inside. Then, you will be able to cultivate and strengthen yourself at any time,” Sun Jianfang said.

Ling Han nodded with an oh. This was equivalent to Spirit Stones, right?

It was just that one could cultivate with Spirit Stones directly, while cultivation with a jade seed could only be done through formations.

Ling Han nodded and put away the Meridian Guiding Fruit.

He did not need it, but he could sell it. Besides, he still wanted to restart his path of alchemy. If he could refine the Meridian Guiding Fruit into a Meridian Guiding Pill, wouldn’t he become rich?

“Go!” Sun Jianfang waved his hand. “I’ll give you 10 days. Then I’ll check if you’ve sensed your meridians.”

“Yes.” Ling Han bowed, then left.

Sun Jianfang stroked his beard and hesitated slightly. Should he relax his deadline of 10 days? This was because the fastest person to sense their meridians in the Ancient Dao Sect had still required 29 days.

’10 days?’

He saw that Ling Han had grasped the Four Directional Fists so quickly, which was why he had changed the deadline at the last minute.

Forget it, 10 days it was. When that time came, this brat would not succeed, and it would be a good opportunity to suppress his arrogance. This would only be beneficial to Ling Han.

Ling Han returned to his room, and decided to learn more about alchemy.

He asked Huan Xue where books on alchemy were.

“Books?” Huan Xue scratched her head, and revealed a troubled expression. “After the upheaval, the world suffered huge destruction. A place like the library was the first to turn into ruins, because it was not protected by a large number of soldiers.”

Ling Han sighed. Was his luck that bad?

“However, if Young Master only wants to look up information, you can use the optical computer!” Huan Xue suddenly said.

“What optical computer?” Ling Han was confused.

“Young Master, have you never used an optical computer in your study before?” Huan Xue was even more confused.

Ling Han shrugged. He had no idea what an optical computer was.

“Aiya, it’s all my fault!” Huan Xue blamed herself. “I forgot that Young Master came out of a rock. How could he know about the things in our world?”

She was taking things for granted too much. Everyone in this world knew about the optical computer. Perhaps even a three-year-old child could play with it. Thus, she naturally thought that Ling Han should also know about it.

“Come, Young Master, I’ll teach you.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The two of them arrived at the study, and Huan Xue began to teach Ling Han how to use the optical computer.

This was a small box-like object with a button on it. With a press, a ray of light shot out, and transformed into the form of a young girl.

‘Hmm, an image projection?’

Due to habit, Ling Han used what he already knew to explain this. This move was often used by Wally. His eyes shone, and he would be able to project any scene, which would look very genuine and realistic.

“I’m your assistant. May I ask what you need me to do?” the girl asked.

“Young Master, you can ask her anything,” Huan Xue said.

This was indeed something that even a three-year-old could play with.

Ling Han nodded, and asked, “How many pill recipes do you know?”

“109,” the girl replied.

“Show me.”

“Understood.”

The projection girl disappeared with a bang. Then, countless specks of light condensed into words and images.

“Purple Essence Pill, which can heal injuries. The ingredients needed are Purple Heart Fruit, Origin Intent Grass, the shell of a 100-year-old turtle… Refinement conditions, Heavenly Unity Formation, Midnight?” Ling Han read, and couldn’t help but reveal a look of surprise.

Refining pills had requirements regarding time and formations?

It was really different.

Ling Han said directly, “Show me the pill recipe for the Meridian Guiding Pill.”

“Yes,” the optical computer said. The words and pictures immediately shattered, and then the light reassembled to form new words and images.

“The Meridian Guiding Pill can help you sense your meridians. The ingredients needed are the Meridian Guiding Fruit. Eh, only the Meridian Guiding Fruit is needed? Refinement requirements, Three Elements Formation. There’s no time restriction.”

Ling Han then said, “Show me the specific information of the Three Elements Formation.”

“Yes.”

The optical computer then showed him the formation. This was a three-dimensional diagram, and every detail could be enlarged.

It was really useful. It was equivalent to bringing a Wally with him.

Ling Han couldn’t help but miss that guy. With the information of this world, coupled with Wally’s ability to analyze and deduce, the two of them would definitely have a happy working relationship.

‘Forget it, I can’t let Wally out now. I have to rely on myself.’

Ling Han began to study the Three Elements Formation.

Actually, setting up this formation was not difficult, but one needed to find suitable terrain. The formation actually used the terrain to draw out the energy contained in the ground and turn it into the “flames” needed for alchemy.

However, there were two conditions for setting up formations. The first was the foundations of the formation, and the second was the jade seeds.

The foundation of the formation was the basics of the formations, and it was the key to triggering the energy of the terrain. Meanwhile, the jade seed would provide the energy that was initially needed to activate the formation.

‘The difficulty now is… firstly, the production of the formation foundations. Secondly, the jade seeds. I’m poor now. Other than a Meridian Guiding Fruit, I don’t have any assets. How am I supposed to get the formation foundations and the jade seed?’

The formation foundations were still alright. Even ordinary stones could be used. It was just that they were not durable. Perhaps they would be destroyed halfway through the refinement process, but the jade seeds were real money.

“Where can I get the money?”
