Chapter 240: Corpse Rain

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Rong Huan Xuan was definitely a conceited person.

He was a genius of martial arts; there was no doubt about that. Additionally, he had also managed to obtain the core inheritance of the Thousand Corpse Sect, so he should have been invincible against any opponent in the same age range as he. But Ling Han was even younger than him, yet was poweful enough to oppose him. This caused killing intent to boil within him.

“Die!” He used a secret technique and punched out, actually producing a light shadow of a black skull that was draping over a similarly black-colored battle armor. A gigantic black blade rose and shot towards Ling Han in a slash.

Ling Han’s expression was a bit cautious. He took a deep breath, raised the bull’s horns and launched his own slash.

Mysterious Three Thousand!

Shua, shua, shua . It was in a single instant when the skull warrior produced by the technique suffered multiple slashes, and was immediately shattered into pieces by the barrage.

Ling Han was a bit out of breath. If it was not for the fact that the space within his Dantian had been expanded a hundredfold, he would have been completely exhausted after managing to launch ten-plus attacks of Mysterious Three Thousand at most. This Sword Style was indeed very powerful, but it also expended an unusual colossal amount of energy. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Moreover, the bull’s horns were still not a sword at the end of the day, so there was a great loss of destructive power. But it was also because the bull’s horns could produce a Level Three flame, which was very effective in dispersing the Corpse Qi, that he could achieve his goal with this one attack.

Rong Huan Xuan was in utter disbelief. That move just now had been a secret technique of the Thousand Corpse Sect, and was at the level of a Black Grade high level technique. It was also something that could only be used by a disciple of the Thousand Corpse Sect, because it required the user to possess Corpse Qi.

This move was a combination of Origin Power and Corpse Qi, and had a terrifying corrosive ability. A martial artist needed only touch a little bit of it, and he would definitely melt completely. But Ling Han unexpectedly managed to unravel this attack in a single slash.

If he knew that this was the invincible sword technique that allowed the Sword Emperor to move unhindered in the world, he might feel a bit honored. That was because the Sword Emperor was too powerful a person—he had started to become known from when he was merely in the Gushing Spring Tier, until he finally reached the Heaven Tier. He had defeated all opponents who were in the same cultivation level as he, and stood invincible at the top of the field of the martial arts.

Facing such a slash, he managed to avoid either death or defeat. This was already very much a miracle!

However, Rong Huan Xuan did not know. Thus, he felt very displeased, and his killing intent became even stronger. “You are indeed a strong foe. I have no choice but to eliminate you!”

Ling Han sighed, and smiled as he said, “We have no enmity between us, so why don’t we simply drink some wine or have some tea?”

“It would be better for you to go to hell and have your drink there!” Rong Huan Xuan released a loud yell, and a black-colored Qi appeared all over his body. A weird scene appeared—the black-colored Qi actually solidified and formed sharp blades all over his body.

At the first glance, it seemed as if he had become some kind of monster.

Ling Han’s expression became even more cautious, and said, “You made Corpse Qi cover your body and forcibly increased your own power?”

“You indeed have a very deep understanding of the Thousand Corpse Sect!” Rong Huan Xuan smirked, and said, “Since that is the case, do you still intend to resist?”

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “You have your trump card, but so do I. Firstly, I had not wanted to reveal it, and secondly, I did not want to waste it on you.”

“Oh, then I would really like to get a look at it.” Rong Huan Xuan moved. With the Corpse Qi enveloping him, his battle prowess had indeed increased drastically, and he was once again able to get the upper hand.

Ling Han humphed and put on the Purple Star Handguard. He had already grasped fully the way to use this Spirit Tool. With instilling his Origin Power into it, the designs on it immediately shone and provided him with a continuous supply of energy.

“Yi?” Rong Huan Xuan exclaimed in surprise. His battle prowess had increased slightly, and Ling Han was also able to similarly increase his own battle prowess, so both sides were back to the same starting line.

It looked like this brat had also encountered a colossal fated opportunity of his own.

However, Rong Huan Xuan had no fear. His greatest trump card were the three copper coffins. This was a secret treasure of the Thousand Corpse Sect. Though he was still unable to fully activate them, as long as he took shelter within them, it might not be possible for even a powerful elite of the Flower Blossoming Tier to lift the lid of the coffin and drag him out. Thus, he was filled with confidence.

“Heng, Ah Da, come out!” he mumbled under his breath, and peng , yet another coffin opened and a Silver-Armored Corpse leaped out.

“Hey, hey, hey. Didn’t we agree on a one-on-one battle? How can you bring out a helper?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Since you know so many secrets of the Thousand Corpse Sect, then you should also definitely know that the greatest technique of my sect is to control corpses. Corpse Soldiers can be considered my sword or saber, so how could it be considered as taking the advantage of numbers to bully the few?” Rong Huan Xuan smiled as well, but did not hesitate at all in issuing his order for the Silver-Armored Corpse to launch its attack at Ling Han.

Spiritual Ocean Tier, what more when it was the peak of the Spiritual Ocean Tier, was not a league that Ling Han was capable of opposing at this moment. Even if he had the Black Tower to transmit power to him and forcibly raised his cultivation to the next tier, it was still not a definite thing that he would be able to resist such a terrifying guy.

After all, the gap between the first and the ninth layer was a bit too big. Moreover, the body of the Silver-Armored Corpse was comparable to the ingredients used to forge a Tier Four weapon. Even it stood there unmoving, it would still require a bit of effort from him to break through its defenses.

Peng!

Right about when Ling Han was thinking of fleeing, a black shadow suddenly dropped down from above and crashed heavily near them, producing a gigantic depression in the ground, causing the latter to shake with a powerful tremor.

Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan immediately ceased their battle. They indeed wanted very much to kill each other, but would definitely not give up their own life to achieve this purpose.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

More and more black shadows dropped down from above, and like rain, they fell around Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan.

Ling Han grew cautious and alert. If he was forced into desperate enough straits, then he could only enter the Black Tower right in front of everyone. If worse came to worst, he could use the chance when the Black Tower would transmit power into him and kill them to prevent them from revealing his secret.

His gaze swept over the surroudings and he could not help but look shocked.

A hand actually stretched out of the large depression created in the ground, and a person came crawling out of it.

This was an old man who was dressed in embroidered robes. He looked like a wealthy man, but there was no sign of life circulating in any part of his body at all.

There was no heartbeat, and no breath. Ling Han was absolutely sure that the blood in this man’s veins was definitely not flowing.

This should be a completely dead man.

But he actually climbed out of the deep pit, and his face was vivid and lively. No matter how one looked at it, he looked like he had just fallen asleep. This was instead even more terrifying.

Not just him. From each and every hole, a corpse came crawling out. It was obvious that there was no sign of life from them at all, yet they were still able to move. They looked a bit like Corpse Soldiers, but they had obviously not been refined at all.

What was even more inconceivable was the fact that these corpses had dropped down from the sky!

Yet Rong Huan Xuan’s eyes immediately lit up and he looked practically like he was about to break out into a dance. “There are actually so many good quality corpses! No wonder the Three Live Corpse Coffins insisted on bringing me here. So it seems that there is a great fated opportunity for me here!

This person had been in Spiritual Pedestal Tier when he was alive! This one was in Flower Blossoming Tier! And here’s another in Spiritual Pedestal Tier!

Hahahaha, I need only refine a few corpses, and it would be enough to do as I like in the North!”

Rong Huan Xuan looked incomparably delighted. He pointed at one of the corpses with his right hand, and said, “When I refine you, you must obey my commands!” He began muttering under his breath, and a black-colored Qi actually spread out from his right hand, wafting towards that corpse.

The corpse seemed like it had not felt anything at all, and merely continued to stare at the sky blankly.

Ling Han too looked at the sky, and could not help but come up with a daring idea: could it be that these corpses were that little black dot in the sky, and it was previously impossible to tell there was more than one because of the distance?

The black light surrounded the corpse’s body, and as if it was alive, it entered into the corpse through its nostrils, ears, and eyes.

Rong Huan Xuan smiled. This was the Source Corpse Qi he had cultivated. As long as a corpse was invaded by this Qi, then the corpse would fall under his control. “Come here!” he commanded.

The corpse seemed to have felt something was off, and suddenly turned to look at Rong Huan Xuan, its body slightly trembling.

Pu , a black-colored Qi shot out from within its body and instantly turned into ash.

Rong Huan Xuan’s previously pale face suddenly reddened, and he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His Source Corpse Qi had been destroyed, which caused him to experience a powerful backlash.
