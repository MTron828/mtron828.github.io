2995 The Eighth Power

Ling Han wasn’t jealous of the fact that Feng Wuding possessed 100 dimensions. After all, the former possessed hundreds of thousands of dimensions. In comparison,100 dimensions were no big deal. They couldn’t even compare to a fraction of the number Ling Han possessed.

What displeased him was the fact that Feng Wuding had naturally mastered 10 first-grade seals.

Logically speaking, this should be his, right?

“Additionally, I have something to tell you,” the will of the last era’s Genesis World said. It could be called the World’s Will, and did not belong to any single being. Instead, it was formed from the souls of all the living beings of the Genesis World of the last era. “Though in the last great battle, Extermination was blasted by the power caused by the destruction of the world, and its physical body was destroyed, and only a sliver of its spirit was left, after suffering this loss, the present Hysteria has become even more terrifying.

“Furthermore, compared to my generation, Extermination only devoured three dimensions at that time, while Hysteria has far surpassed this number now.

“According to my deductions, even if the Genesis World was destroyed again, it would still be impossible to kill Hysteria. Instead, this would allow it to obtain the World’s Core…”

The World’s Will suddenly stopped. After a pause, it continued, “In short, Hysteria will become stronger and stronger. You can’t kill it with your own power.”

Ling Han’s heart jolted. What the hell was the World’s Core?

Why was this voice hesitating here?

In any case, it was about to die soon, so what else was there to hide?

Ling Han did not pursue the matter. If the other party had wanted to tell him, it would not have suddenly stopped.

He only said, “Could it be that Feng Wuding and I have to join forces?”

“You do indeed have to join forces with someone, but it is not Feng Wuding,” the World’s Will said.

“Then, with whom?” Ling Han pressed the matter.

“Extermination.”

Pu!

Ling Han sputtered. Extermination?

‘Have you gone stupid?’

The Genesis World of the last era collapsed, and the main culprit behind that was Extermination. Furthermore, Extermination was the predecessor of Hysteria, and you wanted Extermination to kill Hysteria?

Hehe, it would really be strange if Extermination agreed.

“There’s no need to feel that it’s inconceivable,” the World’s Will said. “When I sensed the existence of a sliver of Extermination’s consciousness, I knew that it would make a comeback one day. Thus, I hid Extermination’s corpse, and used the last of my power to restore it. Moreover, I even allowed it to develop a new consciousness.

“Seventh Tier is the combination of the six fundamental powers and the unique power of a dimension. However, this unique power can only condense into one, 100, 1,000, or even accommodate a true dimension within itself, possessing even greater power. This can be called the seventh fundamental power.

“That’s the case with Hysteria. Every time it devours a dimension, the seventh power would become slightly stronger, far surpassing any fundamental power.

“Hence, it is invincible in this world, and even Seventh Tiers would not be able to stand against it.

“To suppress it, you would have to surpass it in terms of the seventh power.

“But you started later, and can’t directly devour dimensions, either, so you can’t surpass Hysteria.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then nodded slowly. If he relied on himself to strengthen those dimensions in his body, how long would he have to wait? Perhaps, there really would come a day when he could turn a certain dimension in his body into a transcendent dimension, but at that time, Hysteria might have long since devoured all the dimensions, and conquered the entire Genesis World.

Though the fundamental particles in this place had turned into a wall, abundant with energy, this was only a part of that Genesis World, a remnant.

To say the least, even if all of this was handed over to Ling Han, that would only turn him into the Genesis World of the last era.

But it should be known that even if the Genesis World of the last era was destroyed, it had only severely injured Extermination, and could not kill it, and the present Hysteria was even stronger than that.

Thus, the World’s Will had said that he alone couldn’t kill Hysteria.

Ling Han’s expression remained unchanged, but his heart was surging with emotions.

This World’s Will was very good at scheming. It actually hid Extermination’s body long ago, and spent the remaining energy to repair her, creating a new consciousness for her, and turning her into the key to overthrowing Hysteria—which was actually another her.

And Ling Han had also become a chess piece. Hysteria had chosen him, and the World’s Will had also chosen him… He did not agree with what the world said, that it really was just a coincidence.

How could there be anything so coincidental in this world?

However, it was clear that the other party wouldn’t say this out loud.

…This guy had hidden a great many secrets, such as World’s Core and whatnot. Additionally, had Extermination given birth to a new consciousness, or had it been injected with the own consciousness of the World’s Will that replaced it?

Perhaps it could do it, or perhaps it could not. Who would know?

To ask Ling Han to trust such an unfamiliar “person” would really be a joke.

Here, Ling Han had unraveled some of the mysteries, yet gained even more unanswered questions. In fact, he even felt as if he had fallen into some kind of great conspiracy.

“Hence, if you want to destroy Hysteria, you must obtain the eighth fundamental power!” the World’s Will continued.

The eighth fundamental power?

The seventh type was still understandable. After all, it had already existed for a long time. It was just a different way of putting it, but what was the eighth type?

There was such power?

Then why had no one ever grasped it before, and reached an Eighth Tier that had never been attained before?

“Actually, you’ve already seen this kind of power,” the World’s Will said. “Yin and Yang, Life and Death, Creation and Destruction, Right and Reverse. These are all manifestations of the eighth fundamental power, but no one can master it alone. It can only be done by two people working together.”

Hence, it wanted him to join forces with Extermination?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “Are you sure that Extermination will join forces with me to fight Hysteria together?”

“Positive,” the World’s Will said with absolute certainty. “All right, I don’t have much time. I have to fully improve your body so that you will truly possess the ability to become the Genesis World.”

Boom!

A mysterious power entered into Ling Han’s body. This should be on the spiritual level. After all, the words “World’s Will” were enough to explain everything.

However, this power soon dissipated, and the light sphere also quickly extinguished. Hong, long, long, this space was collapsing with a violent bang.

Only a while later, Ling Han saw the energy storm from the Void sweeping towards him.

He understood now. Following the dissipation of the World’s Will, this Genesis World of the last era had also lost its support completely. The dimensional barrier was no longer effective, so it was naturally penetrated by the energy from the Void.

This place would soon cease to exist, and once again return to the Void.

That was because this was originally the territory of the Void, and it should have been impossible for such a group of dimensions to exist. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hong, long, long, the Void energy storm wreaked havoc, yet Ling Han was unmoved.

He spread out his defenses, his physique seemingly indestructible. He would not care about this kind of impact at all.

He was observing his own body. Even though the words of the World’s Will were frank, without any selfish motives at all, Ling Han could not completely believe it, what more trust it.

…Did the other party leave any tricks in his body? He did not want it to suddenly pop out and take control of his body, replacing him.
