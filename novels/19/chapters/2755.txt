2756 Killing a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate

The reason why Heavenly Venerates were so strong was because they could extract the power of heaven and earth for their own use.

But the power of heaven and earth could not be extracted here, so Heavenly Venerates would not be that much more powerful than a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“All of us cannot extract the power of heaven and earth, so let’s just see who is stronger!” Ling Han laughed loudly, unleashing an aggressive counterattack.

He had formed his own “core of heaven and earth,” and he himself could be considered a core of heaven and earth at the same time. His power was unending, so why would he be afraid of a drawn-out battle?

!!

The Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate and the others knew that it would be disadvantageous for them to fight here, but they coveted the secret to Ling Han’s strength, so they were reluctant to just retreat like this. They still continued to attack Ling Han endlessly.

But as their power continued to decline, the three of them became more and more agitated.

If things continued like this… to say nothing of being unable to deal with Ling Han, it would be they that would be suppressed by Ling Han instead.

They hoped for a miracle to happen, that Ling Han’s power would suddenly fall drastically, because they did not believe that there was anyone that could be this freakish, possessing endless power.

However, a miracle did not happen, and their power was very realistically declining.

“Retreat!” The three great Heavenly Venerates had no choice but to retreat. Otherwise, their battle prowess would fall below the Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. By then, how could they possibly be a match for Ling Han?

“Wanting to flee now, how could it be as easy as that?” Ling Han humphed coldly, chasing rapidly after the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate.

“How dare you!!” The three great Heavenly Venerates moved simultaneously, rushing towards Ling Han.

This time, Ling Han was also going all out. Channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he completely ignored the other two great Heavenly Venerates, and merely focused his aggressive attacks on the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, not allowing the latter to have a chance of fleeing back to the Promise City Realm.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The battle prowess of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate was truly violent and fierce. One after another, attacks landed on Ling Han, and the latter felt his chest burn terribly, feeling incredible pain.

But he still ignored them, and just simply blasted the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate. He was determined to detain this man.

If he wanted to have the Promise City Realm listen to him, he had to establish his might first so that the people here would all calm down and listen to him.

A Second Tier Heavenly Venerate was an acceptable choice, what more when the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate had actually wanted to make a move on Ling Jianxue and the others previously.

If time was slightly rewound, and the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was still in his strongest state, it naturally would be a piece of cake for him to escape. However, because of greed, the three of them had to fight until their power declined enough before they were willing to retreat. Then, with Ling Han blasting him at full power, how would he manage to flee?

He would only become weaker and weaker, so how could he possibly match Ling Han?

The other two great Second Tier Heavenly Venerates had also gone mad. With three Heavenly Venerates fighting at the same time, Ling Han was still able to capture or kill one of them, so how would they have the face to see others in future?

The two of them blasted Ling Han continuously, determined to rescue the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate.

Pu!

Ling Han spat out blood, but the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was similarly throwing up blood. His situation was not very good, either.

The situation now was very delicate. If the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate could last for a while longer, then it was possible that he could drag out the battle so that Ling Han would be blasted into a state of severe injury, which would naturally resolve the crisis for him, but if Ling Han could last longer than the Spiritual Gourd, the one who would be collapsing would instead be the latter.

Of course, which of those capable of becoming a Heavenly Venerate did not have a strong determination?

Whether it was Ling Han or the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, both of them were extremely stubborn. No matter how critical the situation was, they would not lose their fighting spirit, either.

In this aspect, the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate was not inferior to Ling Han in the slightest.

But the problem here was that the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate’s battle prowess was still continuously declining, while Ling Han’s battle prowess was not.

This made Ling Han’s advantage gradually stand out. Each strike landed on the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, causing him to quickly collapse.

“You dared make a move on those close to me, die!” Ling Han declared coldly. With a strike, pu, the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate’s head was suddenly pierced through.

“No!” The other two great Second Tier Heavenly Venerates exclaimed in shock. In the first place, they were at a disadvantage in the Realm War, and now the situation would naturally become even worse with another Second Tier Heavenly Venerate killed.

Ling Han ignored them completely, stowed the body of the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate into his Spatial God Tool, and then turned and left.

The other two great Heavenly Venerates only chased a few steps, and then stopped. While Ling Han had sustained severe injury, he could still fight, but if they pursued him into the Martial Crystalline Realm, that would only be committing suicide.

They sighed, shook their heads, and returned. With a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate dead, the war would become even tenser.

Ling Han did not return immediately to the Martial Crystalline Realm, but rather recuperated from his injuries here. Otherwise, there was no guarantee that Yang Zhihe and the others would not turn the tables on him and attack.

It was best to be careful.

His injuries were very serious. After all, he had killed the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate while bearing the attacks of two great Heavenly Venerates forcefully.

‘I am a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, after all. This is where my limit is,’ Ling Han commented inwardly. However, the fact that he was able to kill one of them, even when he was being besieged by three great Second Tier Heavenly Venerates, definitely was a battle merit unprecedented in all of history.

“I have basically walked this path up to this point.” Ling Han was very satisfied with himself. Next, he would only have to return to the Flaming Frost Realm, and master the unique power there, and then he would break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Seven years later, he had finally completely recovered from his injuries and returned to the Martial Crystalline Realm

“Friend Ling, was your journey smooth?” An Tayun personally came out to receive him.

Ling Han smiled, sent out all the people in the Celestial Guest Residence, and then replied, “Not too bad. I encountered some minor problems, but they are dealt with.”

“Oh, what problems?” An Tayun asked.

Ling Han waved his hand, and two new bodies instantly appeared on the ground. A fearful aura surged out, and the two An brothers standing behind An Tayun instantly paled, trembling uncontrollably.

Thankfully, An Tayun had already unleashed his own aura, protecting his two sons.

An Pingtian and An Pinghai were both astounded. Just what level of elite were these two corpses? How could they have such powerful auras even after death?

An Tayun’s eyes swept over them. He saw the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate first, and was only slightly shocked. He knew that this was a newly advanced Heavenly Venerate. However, when he saw the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, his eyes bulged.

This was his old foe. Who knew how many times the two of them had fought? Their strength was more or less equal.

If he entered into the Promise City Realm, he would definitely be slaughtered by the other party, and it was the same the other way round. Yet Ling Han had entered into the Promise City Realm, and not only had he not died, he had even aggressively killed two Heavenly Venerates. Just how terrifying was this?

“Brother Ling, I am truly impressed!” He sighed.

Originally, he had addressed Ling Han as Friend Ling Han, and addressed himself respectfully. Though he recognized Ling Han’s strength, he still had the pride of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. However, now that the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, whose strength was equal to his, had been killed by Ling Han, what else was there for him to be proud of?

Ling Han smiled. “Now that the parents from both sides have arrived, it should be about time to prepare for the wedding, right?”

“Agreed,” An Tayun agreed readily.

...

For two great Heavenly Venerates to ally by marriage was naturally a big deal. When they heard the news, not only did Celestial Kings all arrive to attend the feast, even Heavenly Venerates were no exceptions. Initially, Second Tier Heavenly Venerates had not wanted to arrive personally because of their lofty status, but when they heard of Ling Han’s battle merit, and how even a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate had been slaughtered by his hand, not one of them could sit by calmly, and all appeared personally.

The wedding progressed. The new couple would naturally be teased excessively, while Ling Han, An Tayun, Yang Zhihe, and the Four Nights Heavenly Venerate discussed matters behind closed doors. After allowing them such a long period of consideration, it was naturally time to hear the replies from these people.

If Ling Han had not killed the Spiritual Gourd Heavenly Venerate, the people here would only have shaken their heads. How could they be willing to give up the great matter that they had planned for several dozen epochs?

But now, they were all nodding with agreement.
