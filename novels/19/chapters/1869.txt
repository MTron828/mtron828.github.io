Chapter 1870: Final Battle

On the spectators’ seats, when the master of ceremonies announced that the final battle would directly begin today, the whole martial arena instantly erupted in a storm of protest.

What the heck was this?

It had been agreed that they would be able to watch for four days consecutively, so why had it been shortened to a single day? You guys had just decided the winner behind closed doors, right? The others fought earnestly all the way here, and in the end, they were disqualified for no reason?

But the master of ceremonies also said that the other contestants had all forfeited on their own initiative, and they could not force them to fight, after all, right?

Thus, whether you were in agreement or otherwise, you would have to accept this result.

There would only be one battle, and that was Ling Han against Zhao Qingfeng!

“Ling Han?” Lu Xianming murmured. Could it be that it was that person? It couldn’t be so coincidental, right?

“Young Master Lu!” Sun Dong approached. “What is it?”

Lu Xianming shook his head, and thought that they were only two people who shared the same name. After all, there were really too many people in the Celestial Realm, so it was not unusual for two people to share the same name.

Meanwhile, Sun Dong was almost prostrating himself in admiration of Zhao Qingfeng.

He said that he would directly fight the final battle, and he was really f****** going to fight the final battle. All the others had been scared into flight. He was really too domineering. In this battle against Ling Han, hehe, that damn guy would definitely be crushed into dust by Zhao Qingfeng.

After waiting for so many days, the moment for his revenge had finally come.

On the other side, Cheng Fengyun also had a feeling of exultation. Today, Ling Han was definitely going to be defeated!

“Initially, it was still possible for Ling Han to stay a few more days on this stage, but today is the final battle, and he is facing Zhao Qingfeng directly, then that would mean undoubted defeat!” he spoke frankly with assurance, as if he was Zhao Qingfeng himself.

However, there was no one stoking the fires today, because everyone had heard about Zhao Qingfeng’s past deeds.

...Just some time ago, he had directly forced a few Holy Sons and Holy Daughter from several Celestial King Tier-level sects to leave, and three of the victors of the fourth level had also forfeited. That was all because they were wary of Zhao Qingfeng.

This person was so strong that he had reached the level of destroying worlds.

No matter how strong Ling Han was, he could only lose in resentment faced with Zhao Qingfeng. The only question here was exactly how many moves Ling Han could survive.

Three, five, 10?

And he still dared to fight. His courage was really admirable.

After the master of ceremonies blabbered for a while, this final battle that was much anticipated yet taking place ahead of time was finally going to begin.

The two contestants came on stage. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“En?” Suddenly, an expression of shock appeared on Lu Xianming’s face. He had seen Ling Han.

F***, it really was this guy.

He couldn’t help but shake his head and chuckle. This world was really too small, wasn’t it? Not even a year had passed, and he had met Ling Han again.

No!

Lu Xianming immediately thought in his heart. He could not allow Ling Han to die at Zhao Qingfeng’s hands. Firstly, he still owed his life to the former, and secondly, Ling Han’s strength was very powerful, and he needed this kind of helper.

Mm-hm, he would step out to stop the battle after Ling Han was defeated. With his identity, Zhao Qingfeng would have to give him some face.

In this manner, he would repay Ling Han’s kindness, and could take advantage of the chance to recruit him too.

Haha, what a great idea.

Sun Dong did not notice the changing expressions on Lu Xianming’s face. After he saw Ling Han, his whole head was filled with the tragic scene of having his a*s pierced, and he wanted nothing more than to devour Ling Han’s flesh and drink his blood.

“Begin.” The master of ceremonies waved a hand, and left the stage to these two young prodigies.

Zhao Qingfeng stood, clasping his hands behind his back. He set his eyes on Ling Han, and said, “Not bad. At least you have some courage. I thought you would be a coward as well.”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “If I left, who would beat you to mush?”

“Hahaha, your courage is something to be praised. I hope your strength will not disappoint me.” Zhao Qingfeng was not angered, but instead laughed.

His only fear was that Ling Han was not strong enough, and could not give him a strong enough stimulation, arousing all his potential.

The longer he stayed at the fourth severance, the lower the chances were for breaking through to the fifth severance. The accumulation of power over time was of no use at all. Instead, it would only cause a contrary effect.

Ling Han said, “I, too, hope that you are strong. Otherwise, stepping on a weakling would be something very boring.”

“Arrogant, but there is no meaning to it.” Zhao Qingfeng raised his right hand, and a green halo of light appeared in the palm of his hand. Then, a green sword appeared within the green halo, and he gripped it in his hand.

Zhao Qingfeng showed a cruel expression. For this “feast”, he had already waited for a very long time, and now he was impatient to finally enjoy it.

Cruelly killing a prodigy that was close to his equal would endlessly arouse his Dao Heart.

That was right, he had cultivated the Regulation of Slaughter.

“Of all the Kings in the world, Qingfeng is the strongest!” Zhao Qingfeng stated calmly, an indescribable pride clear in his tone.

Ling Han was surprised. This guy was really shameless.

Of all the Kings in the world, you actually dared to call yourself the strongest. Where had you gotten such courage from?

It should be known that even Yan Xianlu did not have the right to call himself the strongest, what more you.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh out loud, and shook his head.

“You actually dare laugh at me?” Zhao Qingfeng smirked coldly, and the green blade in his hand rose, striking out at the empty air in front of Ling Han. Shua, a flash of Sword Qi swept out, turning into a sword that was 30,000 meters long, and slashing harshly at Ling Han.

He was arrogant, but he was indeed strong. This strike had gathered supreme great dao, as if it could slice open the heavens and earth.

“As expected of a prodigy from the Eternal Prosperity Sect!” On the spectators’ seats, a few powerful figures were watching the battle. They were all Ascending Origin Tier elites, the strongest beneath Celestial King Tier. In their eyes, to say nothing of Zhao Qingfeng and Ling Han, even if Yan Xianlu had come, he would only be a child.

No matter how strong your potential was, that was a matter of the future. How could a Severing Mundane Tier possibly gain the serious notice of Ascending Origin Tiers?

“His battle prowess is indeed strong enough.” The powerful figures made their assessment.

“This brat has already cultivated the Severing Mundane Tier to perfection. I do not believe that he is incapable of breaking through to the Dividing Soul Tier with his talent.”

“...Unless!”

These powerful figures all exchanged looks, and could see a sliver of shock in each other’s eyes. They had thought of a legend. It really was just a legend. At least, they had never heard of anyone who had successfully accomplished it.

Above the fourth severance, there was still the fifth severance!

“Whichever Celestial King Tier sect this boy went to, he would be qualified to become a Holy Son. However, he still chose to become Yan Xianlu’s follower. Perhaps it is also for the sake of completing the fifth severance.”

These powerful figures were all guessing, and a hint of admiration appeared in their expressions. Even they were slightly stunned by Zhao Qingfeng’s resolve.

“However, with this, Old Zi Cheng would definitely be stomping his feet in fury after causing him to earn a lot less profit for no reason,” a shortie that had his hair tied in countless braids suddenly said with a laugh.

“Hahahaha!” The other powerful figures all laughed loudly. Thinking of that money grubber look of Alchemist Zi Cheng, they really anticipated the expression he would have on his face when he heard of the news.

Amidst the laughter of these mighty figures, this flash of Sword Qi Zhao Qingfeng had shot out blasted towards Ling Han.

Ling Han shot out a fist. Peng, the Regulations of Fire entwined around his fist, and his punch landed on the Sword Qi.

The Sword Qi crumbled instantly. However, Ling Han was also forced into a retreat by the shock wave caused by this clash, all the way until he had reached the boundary of the arena, and then his retreat was stopped by the wall behind him. With a bang, he had crashed so hard into the wall that it shook.

What a frightening strike. It was only a careless wave, and it already possessed such might.

Ling Han frowned slightly. He was not inferior to his opponent in talent, but because there was a gap of a minor level between them, with third severance against fourth severance, and added with the fact that Zhao Qingfeng was also close to monarch tier-level, he had fallen into a disadvantage.

‘This is fun. Let’s battle, then!’
