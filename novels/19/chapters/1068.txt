Chapter 1069: Obtaining the Sword

Ling Han was stunned. That was the Eternity Sky Emperor, one of the three supreme leaders of the Joint Peace Planet! Yet one of his arms had actually been sliced off!

One had to realize that this Nine Demons Sword was a God Tool handed down by the ancestors of the Chang Clan. This meant that it was of the same lineage as the cultivation technique that their clan practiced. However, even with this link between them, the Eternity Sky Emperor still had one of his arms sliced off.

It was abundantly clear just how powerful this Nine Demons Sword was.

If he were to obtain it, would Empress Luan Xing still be a match for him? There was every possibility that she would be snatched by him and become his concubine!

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel extremely p*ssed off upon thinking of this possibility.

He knew that his emotions were being affected by the empress’ tremendous charm, yet even so, he was still repulsed by the thought of her being snatched by another man. He didn’t want to see Empress Luan Xing falling into the embrace of any other man.

Perhaps this kind of selfish thought would occur to any man who had ever laid his eyes upon Empress Luan Xing.

“Hahahaha!” The Eternity Sky Emperor’s boisterous laugh boomed down from the sky. The radiant light dissipated, revealing his proud figure and the Nine Demons Sword, which was now firmly gripped in his remaining left hand.

It was evident that he had obtained the Divine Sword!

This Divine Sword was passed down through bloodline inheritance, after all, and the Eternity Sky Emperor was also extremely powerful himself. After sacrificing an arm, he was finally able to become the new owner of the Nine Demons Sword.

Ling Han could feel the overwhelming power of the sword even from within the Black Tower. It was as if this sword could pierce through his soul and tear him to shreds.

This was the Nine Demons Sword, a God Tool at the Eternal River Tier, meaning that it was at least a Level 13 God Tool!

Even though it was snapped and broken, it was still extremely terrifying. This was clear from the fact that the Eternity Sky Emperor had still lost an arm even though he was incredibly powerful and had cultivated a corresponding secret technique.

Moreover, this was only one-quarter of the God Tool. If he were to find and obtain the remaining three parts, and then fuse them together, how devastating would its might become?

The Nine Flames Heavenly King leaped to the Eternity Sky Emperor’s side, and asked, “Imperial Brother, are you alright?”

Since the Nine Demons Sword had already been obtained, the murderous aura in this place all started to dissipate. The gigantic gathering of murderous aura naturally started to dissipate as well. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“It’s nothing,” the Eternity Sky Emperor replied casually. “I merely lost an arm. It’ll be fully healed after half a year of rest.” This was no small wound, yet compared to his increase in strength, such a wound indeed paled in comparison.

“I’ll hand the remaining matters to you. I have to finish refining this sword, and when I’m done, obtaining the remaining three blade segments will become much easier,” the Eternity Sky Emperor said.

“Understood!” The Nine Flames Heavenly King immediately accepted the command. The remaining three sword segments also possessed overwhelming murderous aura, so it was necessary for them to construct sacrificial altars to suppress them before they tried to obtain the sword segments. Otherwise, it would be tremendously difficult for the Eternity Sky Emperor to succeed even if he already possessed the sword hilt, and even if he was a descendant of the Chang Clan.

The Eternity Sky Emperor turned around and left, tearing through space as he did so.

There was strong killing intent in the Nine Flames Heavenly King’s eyes as he swept the surroundings with his gaze.

He knew that Ling Han had been hiding in some obscure location before, though he didn’t know how Ling Han had managed to hide his aura. Even though he had launched a flurry of attacks, he had still been unable to force Ling Han out of his hiding place. Right now, he was still unable to determine whether Ling Han was still in this place or not.

He detested this ant that had almost ruined their sacrifices, and he dearly wished to stomp this ant to death.

However, he didn’t have the spare time to stand guard here. In any case, the Eternity Sky Emperor had already obtained the hilt of the Nine Demons Sword, meaning that his battle prowess had already soared to the pseudo-Eternal River Tier. Thus, there was nothing to worry about even if the secrets behind their actions were leaked.

That being the case, he turned around and left after looking around for one last time. He still had many matters to attend to.

Ling Han finally exited the Black Tower after a long time. This was to avoid being caught in a trap, although Ling Han felt that the possibility was small—would a mighty elite at the Heavenly Body Tier lay a trap for a small junior such as himself?

Ling Han parted ways with the small dog before retrieving his Cloud Piercing Shuttle and hurrying toward the Eastern Rain Nation’s encampment.

Because there was no murderous aura to block his path anymore, his speed increased to an incredible level. It took him a mere few hours to arrive above the furious river.

By the looks of it, the rumors were true, and this furious river was indeed carved out by a powerful elite. If this elite wasn’t the work of the Chang Clan’s ancestor, then it was the extraplanetary elite he had been battling against.

Ling Han landed his shuttle.

“Identify yourself!” A group of soldiers instantly surrounded him.

“I’m Ling Han, a student from the Scarlet Heaven Academy!” Ling Han reported his identity to the soldiers.

The soldiers didn’t dare believe him unreservedly, and hurriedly went to invite members of the Scarlet Heaven Academy to verify Ling Han’s claim.

“Ling Han!” Zhao Lun immediately ran over. Upon seeing Ling Han, the expression on his face became indescribably strange.

Suffering a heavy defeat on his mission to launch a surprise attack on the Golden Lion Nation had dealt a heavy blow to his confidence. It had been his first time leading an army, after all, and such a result was a humiliating stain on his pride as the son of a Great General.

However, he still consoled himself in his mind, convincing himself that his loss had been justified. After all, the enemy had ambushed them with hundreds of elites at the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, Ling Han had also been captured by the Golden Lion Nation, and would almost certainly be killed.

Right now, however, Ling Han was standing before him unscathed, so how could his expression not be dark?

“How did you manage to make it back alive?” He humphed, and said, “You definitely betrayed us and surrendered to the enemy. That’s why they released you... as a spy!”

Zhao Lun’s words sent a wave of commotion through the encampment.

There was one kind of person that soldiers hated the most—traitors!

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Heir Zhao, through which of your eyes do I look like a traitor? Don’t spout nonsense if you don’t have any evidence. Otherwise, even though you’re the son of Great General Zhao, I’ll still have to go with you to resolve this situation before the empress!”

Zhao Lun humphed coldly, and said, “We were ambushed, and I was only able to break through the heavy encirclement thanks to the protection of my treasured armor. How were you able to escape? Moreover, you’ve returned several days after me, so is it wrong for me to assume that you surrendered after being captured?”

Since he hadn’t been able to kill Ling Han on the battlefield, he might as well pin another crime to his name. This was a crime that concerned betrayal! If Ling Han was found guilty, there would be absolutely no need to interrogate him before the empress. Rather, they would be able to punish him according to military regulations and kill him on the spot!

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Heir Zhao is truly a brilliant storyteller! The situation had been so desperate, and I’m neither at the Sun Moon Tier, nor do I have any treasured armors to protect me. Thus, I could only escape without any regard for where I was heading. I only arrived back here after running around in a massive circle, so it’s only natural that I arrived several days after Heir Zhao.”

Zhao Lun pointed at Ling Han, and roared, “Enough with the excuses!”

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “Heir Zhao, you need evidence to back up your claims. Otherwise, I’ll take you to court for defamation.”

Zhao Lun looked at him intently before saying, “I will find the evidence!” He aggressively swept his robe through the air as he left.

‘Headstrong and narrow-minded.’

Ling Han critiqued Zhao Lun in his mind, and then immediately headed off to find the Ninth King. The matters surrounding the Nine Demons Sword were incredibly important, and had to be reported as soon as possible. Otherwise, the Eternity Sky Emperor would genuinely be able to act as he pleased if he were to obtain the complete Nine Demons Swords.

“Ling Han!” Shui Yanyu came out to meet him, and tears involuntarily flowed down her face when she saw him.

The assault squad had been annihilated, and only Zhao Lun had managed to make it back alive. This caused pessimism to permeate through the camp, with everyone believing that those who had failed to return were all dead.

Although Shui Yanyu was confident in Ling Han’s abilities, she still couldn’t help but become anxious after failing to see him return after one, two, and then three days. Now that Ling Han had finally returned, she felt as if a heavy weight had been lifted off her shoulders. At the same time, a feeling of weakness swept through her entire body.
