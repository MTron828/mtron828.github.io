Chapter 1210: Venerable Trinity

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Who could have imagined that the trial of a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator would eventually lead to the appearance of an Eternal River Tier elite?

Empress Luan Xing’s expression changed drastically. She was powerful, yet she still had yet to reach the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. So, how could she stand up against an Eternal River Tier elite? However, she refused to back down, saying, “Senior, heaven and earth are great, but nothing is as great as justice!

“This nest of rats is cooking up charges and trying to frame the innocent; I can’t watch on and do nothing!”

“Heh, young lady, the matters of the Majestic Heaven Sect don’t need your input!” Venerable Trinity’s voice traveled over, yet he was nowhere to be seen. “Just answer my question. Why did you wound my disciple?”

Yang Hao chuckled coldly. Venerable Trinity had bestowed him with a divine sense seal, and this meant that he could contact Venerable Trinity simply by injecting his divine sense into the seal. Reporting matters like this couldn’t be any easier.

Moreover, this revealed just how much Venerable Trinity liked this new disciple. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

So what if Empress Luan Xing was a Heavenly Body Tier elite? She was nothing but trash before an Eternal River Tier elite! Yet, she had actually dared to hit him... not once, but twice! Humph! It was time for her to pay the price!

Empress Luan Xing raised her brow, and said, “Senior wants to pick on the weak?”

“Little girl, don’t try to constrain me with words!” Venerable Trinity said. “I can let you off one more time if you kneel down and apologize to my disciple.”

This was complete and utter humiliation.

To say nothing of a ruler like Empress Luan Xing, even ordinary Heavenly Body Tier elites couldn’t swallow their pride to kneel down and kowtow to a Sun Moon Tier cultivator.

Empress Luan Xing’s expression changed drastically. She hadn’t expected Venerable Trinity to be so protective of his disciples. Could they still reason objectively?

However, reason was always held in the hands of elites. Weaklings could only resign themselves to accepting this.

“Ha! Ha! Ha!” Empress Luan Xing laughed coldly. Out of her nine clones, only one had yet to reach the Heavenly Body Tier. However, with her wealth of experience and her abundance of resources, Hu Feiyun only needed a maximum of 100 years to reach the Heavenly Body Tier.

Once Hu Feiyun reached the Heavenly Body Tier, she would be able to advance to the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier. She would then be able to break through to the Eternal River Tier.

King tiers who cultivated each level to perfection would possess a power of six stars once they advanced to the next major tier. This would be enough to battle against Venerable Trinity.

Based on all the available intelligence, Venerable Trinity was most likely at the late stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

However, Empress Luan Xing was still too weak at this moment—far too weak!

“Young lady, it looks like you’re unwilling to yield!” Venerable Trinity chuckled, and said, “However, that won’t change anything! Hao’er, she hit you, so why don’t you hit her back?”

“But Master, she’s at the Heavenly Body Tier. I’m no match for her,” Yang Hao replied respectfully.

“Heh, isn’t your master here for you?” Venerable Trinity said.

“Thank you, Master!” A cold smile instantly appeared on Yang Hao’s face. Venerable Trinity had already made his stance very clear—he was allowing him to return the favor. With Venerable Trinity protecting him, how could a measly Heavenly Body Tier elite fight back?

No matter how freakish a Heavenly Body Tier elite was, they were still like defenseless babies in the eyes of Eternal River Tier elites!

Ling Han’s expression became very anxious. It would be extremely humiliating if Empress Luan Xing were hit, even if this was only her clone. Empress Luan Xing wouldn’t be able to tolerate this, and he more so wouldn’t be able to tolerate this!

“Come here!” he shouted. So what if Venerable Trinity was present? He was going to put Empress Luan Xing in his Black Tower!

She was his future wife, so how could he let her be humiliated?

Empress Luan Xing had initially planned on causing a commotion and making everyone aware of this injustice. She had wanted to win Ling Han a fair trial. However, she hadn’t been able to control her emotions, and she had ended up hitting Yang Hao and causing Venerable Trinity to come. This made the situation even direr than before.

However, she was a resolute person, and she immediately dashed toward Ling Han.

Venerable Trinity laughed, and said, “Heh, trying to flee?”

Empress Luan Xing was instantly frozen in place. It was as if she had become a statue.

Yang Hao snickered as he walked toward Empress Luan Xing. He raised his hand, and he was just about to slap her.

He was going to exact his revenge so soon, and this filled him with pleasure.

Of course, this was only a clone of Empress Luan Xing. If he saw her true appearance, it was very likely that he wouldn’t have the heart to slap her. However, being as proud as Empress Luan Xing was, she naturally wouldn’t use her appearance to garner sympathy.

Shua!

Yang Hao’s hand struck at Empress Luan Xing’s face.

However, a shadow suddenly flashed over.

Pa!

There was a crisp smacking sound.

Ling Han was sent flying by the strike. He had activated the Star Plucking Step and dashed in front of Yang Hao, blocking the strike for Empress Luan Xing. However, even though his physique was powerful, there was still a limit to how much power it could withstand.

Yang Hao was at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, and his strike had broken several of Ling Han’s Godly bones.

“Wah!” Ling Han vomited mouthfuls of blood. After enduring a full-power strike of a Sun Moon Tier elite, black spots swam before his eyes. He was about to faint—or even die—at any moment.

He had never been so close to death before.

He forced himself to concentrate as he circulated a drop of Indestructible True Fluid. His body instantly recovered.

“Hmm?” Venerable Trinity was astonished by Ling Han’s tremendous recovery ability. Although Ling Han’s lunging block had also been spectacular, that was simply because Venerable Trinity hadn’t paid any attention to him. Otherwise, there was no way Ling Han could have blocked that strike.

Meanwhile, Yang Hao’s eyes also widened in surprise. ‘He didn’t die after being hit by my full-power strike? Heh, so what? That strike was only a whisker away from killing him. He’ll be a corpse if I hit again. There’s no way he can endure another strike, right?

‘Anyhow, he probably ingested some natural treasures before coming here. Otherwise, how could he have recovered instantly?’

He chuckled coldly before turning his gaze back to Empress Luan Xing. She was being suppressed by Venerable Trinity, meaning that she was completely defenseless.

There was no pleasure in slapping a Mountain River Tier cultivator. If he wanted to slap someone, he would slap Heavenly Body Tier elites! These slaps would be loud, and these slaps would be euphoric! Moreover, the Heavenly Body Tier elite before him had made him spit blood and lose life essence twice—he had to exact revenge!

He swung his hand at Empress Luan Xing again. He knew that Ling Han would definitely lunge over and attempt to block him, but he didn’t care at all. Toying with Ling Han felt absolutely amazing.

Peng!

Sure enough, Ling Han activated the Star Plucking Step and blocked his strike again. Like before, he was sent flying into the distance. Clouds of blood burst from his body, and several of his Godly bones snapped again. This strike was even more vicious as Yang Hao had unleashed the Regulations of heaven and earth in addition to his Sun Moon Tier power.

Hundreds of divine patterns materialized in the air, intertwining to form a terrifying killing intent.

Ling Han was barely hanging on to life. Not being killed by that strike was already thanks to his freakishly tough physique. After all, even those at the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier couldn’t shatter Level Five Godly metal with a single strike.

“All of you... deserve to die!” Empress Luan Xing cried out sharply. There was astounding killing intent in her eyes.

A ruler was enraged, and heaven and earth lost their luster!

Her body trembled slightly, and it seemed as if she were about to break free from Venerable Trinity’s grasp.

“Heh, young lady, you’re far too naive!” Venerable Trinity said with a chuckle. The pressure on Empress Luan Xing increased explosively, and she was instantly rendered immobile again.
