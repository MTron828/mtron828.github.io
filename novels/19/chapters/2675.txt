2676 Tyrant

If Qin Shuang was a disciple of the martial academy, Ling Han would definitely deny it completely. Killing one of his fellow disciples was a heavy crime.

But if he was not a disciple of the martial academy?

Then there was no need to be reserved. Counter soldiers with arms and water with an earth weir. Just do whatever you like.

“You are really bold to dare to touch even one of my men!” He Yufeng said, but the expression on his face was still nonchalant, as if he was not angered at all.

Indeed, Qin Shuang was only one of his subordinates, not a member of his family. Moreover, he had already cultivated to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, so how could he possibly display all his emotions easily?

“I am in quite a good mood now, so my punishment for you is for you to be my servant for an epoch. Do you yield?” He Yufeng continued.

When everyone heard this, they were all gritting their teeth internally.

Ling Han’s freakish nature was clear for all to say. To say nothing of an epoch, it was possible he would only need several tens of billions of years, and he would be able to step out of the Celestial King Tier, and become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. If he were really to bow down to He Yufeng, and become the latter’s servant, then even if Ling Han became a Heavenly Venerate in the future, it would also leave behind a humiliation that would never be erased.

Throughout history, there had never been a time when a Heavenly Venerate had become the servant of another.

…What Heavenly Venerate was not extremely noble and proud?

He Yufeng was really too ruthless, wasn’t he?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “I am a disciple of the martial academy. Acting this way, don’t you think that is going too far?”

“Too far?” He Yufeng laughed loudly. “You are too naive! Rules can only bound mortals, and I have already leapt out of the mortal realm. The Regulations of heaven and earth cannot bind me, and neither can the rules of the mortal world! Do you think that the martial academy would punish me severely if I killed you here today?

“At most, it would only be a few harmless words of reprimand!”

These words were spoken extremely arrogantly. This was practically ignoring the martial academy completely, but everyone had no choice but to admit that He Yufeng’s words were indeed logical.

Heavenly Venerates, even if it was just a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, had already leapt out of the chess game, and they could write their own rules to decide how the game should be played.

Would the martial academy impose a heavy punishment on a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate for the sake of a Celestial King disciple?

Absolutely not!

Otherwise, the Celestial King Graveyard wouldn’t have existed in the first place. Wouldn’t it have been fine to just kill those Celestial Kings that had committed severe crimes? What would’ve been the point of sending them to prison?

Those Celestial Kings that had powerful backgrounds were like that, so what more when it was a Heavenly Venerate himself.

He Yufeng stood with his arms crossed behind his back, his expression appearing very relaxed. As he saw it, he was only going through the motions. If Ling Han did not yield, he would just move to get rid of him, as simple as that.

He would be just that overbearing, but so what?

He was a Heavenly Venerate, and that was why he could be so willful. Even if you were furious, you were outraged, you were dissatisfied, so what?

Everyone’s eyes were focused on Ling Han. People wanted to know how he would react.

Would he bear with this, and get this over with first, or choose to die in battle instead?

No matter what, Ling Han’s fate would definitely be terrible.

Ling Han broke into a smile. “Really, I don’t believe it!”

The smile on He Yufeng’s face instantly froze. He humphed. “The word of a Heavenly Venerate is even heavier than the Regulations of heaven and earth. You dare to refuse; this is an insult to me!”

How could a Heavenly Venerate tolerate being insulted?

He stretched out a hand, and a terrifying pressure was instantly exerted. Everyone felt suffocated, and their blood vessels popped out, looking like they were close to bursting.

“Lord He!” Wang Qianyang suddenly spoke up. “I would like to ask Lord He for some face, to spare this boy just this once.”

‘Wang Qianyang!’ everyone thought simultaneously.

The Wang Clan was a veteran noble clan, and the grand elder of the Wang Clan was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, an existence that the masses could only look up at in admiration. With Wang Qianyang speaking up on Ling Han’s behalf like this, they were sure that He Yufeng would definitely give him some face, right?

He Yufeng did not say anything, and merely stared at Wang Qianyang. The atmosphere became colder and colder. Everyone couldn’t help but shiver.

Only when it reached the point that some of them were close to screaming in spite of themselves did He Yufeng finally spoke. “If it was that Third Tier Heavenly Venerate of the Wang Clan that spoke, I would take a step back. If it was Brother Ande speaking, I would give him some face. However, you are but a mere Ninth Heaven Celestial King. What right do you have to ask me to give you face?”

Gasp!

Everyone inhaled sharply. None of them had expected that He Yufeng would actually not give Wang Qianyang any face at all.

It should be known that Wang Qianyang was the clan leader of the Wang Clan. Furthermore, it was also possible that he could break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

But when everyone thought about it again, they nodded. In terms of background, He Yufeng’s old man was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, a level higher than even the grand elder of the Wang Clan, and in terms of their individual status, He Yufeng was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, high and noble.

Then, He Yufeng really had no need to give face to Wang Qianyang. No one could find any wrong in that.

Meanwhile, Wang Qianyang was so furious that he was shaking. He was the clan leader of the Wang Clan. From a certain aspect, he represented a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. Even a true Heavenly Venerate would be very polite to him, yet now someone was treating him with utter and complete disdain. How could he not feel angry?

“Moreover, I have just broken through, yet you dare to make me fail. What is the meaning of this?” He Yufeng asked coldly.

Wang Qianyang’s beard moved even though there was no wind. He pointed at He Yufeng. “Fine, I truly would like to see. What do you dare do to me?”

He stood in front of Ling Han.

Wang Yangming hesitated slightly, but he, too, took a step and stood beside Wang Qianyang.

The Wang Clan had shown where they stood. They were going to stand on Ling Han’s side.

“Merely biting off more than you can chew!” He Yufeng moved, stretching out his right hand, which turned into a colossal hand that grabbed out at Wang Qianyang and Wang Yangming. There were no seals flickering. It was just a giant hand of green, as if it was carved from green stone, but the moment his hand extended, might rolled out strongly. Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would feel fear.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was someone that could only be blocked by at least 10 peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings!

Both Wang Qianyang and Wang Yangming went all out, but how could just the two of them block a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate? Within just a few moves, they were both wounded, and collapsed to sit on the ground, throwing up blood continuously.

He Yufeng withdrew his hand, and declared proudly, “For the sake of the Rising Clouds Heavenly Venerate, I will only issue a minor punishment, and spare your lives!”

Both Wang Qianyang and Wang Yangming were coughing up blood continuously, and could not speak at all.

Ling Han’s hands balled into fists, fury burning in his heart. He knew that He Yufeng would definitely be a tyrant, but for him to be tyrannical to this extent was something he had not expected.

They were in the martial academy, but he was actually still so unrestrained!

“Is there anyone that objects to my course of action?” He Yufeng asked calmly, sweeping a look at the surroundings.

No one dared to make eye contact, all of them lowering their gazes.

Meanwhile, the Imperial Void Celestial King and Yu Wudi were overjoyed. Ling Han was done for this time; he was definitely finished.

Another person who was delighted was Zhuo Kai. He was smiling so wide that the corners of his lips were almost reaching his ears. He wanted nothing more than to clap loudly in delight. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Grandpa Dog disagrees!” The large black dog stepped out. “Brat, you have just cultivated a few more years. If Little Han were given several hundred million years’ time, see if he won’t thrash you, and make you call him grandpa!”

He Yufeng’s expression instantly darkened. This damn dog’s tongue was truly poisonous. Not only had he insulted him in a single breath, he had also dragged his father into the matter. He humphed. “To dare act insolent in front of me, how dare you!” He moved once more, grabbing out at the large black dog.

With his power, if he was grabbed solidly, the large black dog would definitely be crushed into pieces.

“If you can, come and chase Grandpa Dog!” The large black dog was previously speaking arrogantly, but when it really came down to a fight, he would be running faster than anyone. Xiu! In an instant, he raced out of the abode.
