“Someone from the outside who had come to train?” Zhao Yuanyi immediately asked.

The disappearance of his son was the doing of that Li Long, so he was the one who wanted to find Ling Han more than anyone else because it was possible that his son was still alive.

“It is very possible. Otherwise, someone who has such astonishing battle prowess, even if he really had killed his fellow disciples, should still have been exempted from punishment,” Lu Gaojian said.

At present, the greatest enemy that was laid out in front of all of them was Hysteria. As long as they could resist the main forces of Hysteria in the future, then no matter what crime they had committed, it could still be forgiven, or at least they would be given the chance to redeem themselves by good service.

With how freakish Ling Han’s battle prowess was, how could he possibly be thrown into the Celestial King Graveyard and allowed to rot?

Hence, the chance that he had come here to train was greater.

“Damn it!” All the Celestial Kings humphed coldly. They could be considered to feel great hatred for all those who had come here just for training.

Yet the Azure Ghost Celestial King’s expression was cold and aloof. That was because only he himself knew that he actually could be somewhat considered as being here to train as well, but his motive was definitely not to advance his own cultivation level, but rather the Brahman Celestial Flowers.

There was more that he thought about. Could Ling Han have been sent by some kind of force? Maybe his motive was the same as his, and that was for the sake of the Brahman Celestial Flowers.

“Brother Lu”—he glanced towards Lu Gaojian—”when will we be acting?”

Lu Gaojian nodded his head, and said, “The Ancient Tomb is extremely important. The instruction from Lord Desolate Moon is to unite the power of all the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings inside the Celestial King Graveyard and open it together. Thus, there will be no action for now. Please wait a while longer, Brother Azure Ghost. When the time comes, I will inform you.”

This answer did not please the Azure Ghost Celestial King very much. He frowned slightly, and asked, “Then when will we be able to obtain the second part of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll?”

“Brother Azure Ghost, do not rush. According to the agreement, when we have arrived in front of the Ancient Tomb, Lord Desolate Moon will hand over the second part of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll,” Lu Gaojian said smilingly.

Everyone’s eyes became heated. After obtaining all nine parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and combining them into one, they would be able to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. The temptation of this to them was really too great—once they had become Heavenly Venerates themselves, they would be able to leave this f*cking place.

Even though they were all Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, high and lofty, once the Ghost King City was conquered by an opposing force, the possibility that they would die with the city was extremely high.

In this place, the lives of Celestial Kings were worth nothing, and even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could be sacrificed.

“Then we’ll make use of this time, and find that ‘Li Long’ first!” the Azure Ghost Celestial King declared coldly.

The eyes of all the Ninth Heaven Celestial King spat fire. There were only a rare few whose descendants had not been killed by Ling Han, so it was natural that they wanted nothing more than to capture Ling Han and execute him.

***

Ling Han did not cease his course of bloodshed. He would occasionally make a move. If there were higher tier Celestial Kings on guard, he would avoid them without any battle, but if there weren’t, he would move without any hesitation, causing complete chaos and mayhem in Ghost King City.

He was clearly just a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, so how could he possibly cause such great commotion?

Firstly, Ghost King City was too large. Furthermore, this was a prison for holding Celestial Kings, with the power laid down by Heavenly Venerates. The ground was very firm, and had a unique weakening effect on a sweep of divine sense. Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly cover every single inch of this ground.

Secondly, Ling Han had copied the actions of the Azure Ghost Celestial King, and made some modifications to the formation patterns, allowing his Spatial Celestial Tool to have even better coverage.

He even wanted to instill the Heaven Deceiving Technique into the Celestial Tool so it would have a disguising effect as well.

This was not impossible, because Celestial Tools were formed from a Celestial Weapon equipped with one’s individual martial intent in the first place. However, talking was easy, but it was not an easy matter to truly achieve this. In any case, Ling Han did not lack time. When the search efforts were intense in the city, he would study this matter inside the Spatial Celestial Tool.

Time passed quickly, and 10,000 years had already passed.

Ling Han had finally instilled the Heaven Deceiving Technique into the Spatial Celestial Tool so that this Celestial Tool would have better security. Even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King was staring at him, they would still be unable to distinguish it from any other ordinary stone.

For the sake of this, Ling Han had also disguised this thing as a small stone.

“This shall be named… Celestial Guest Residence.”

Ling Han decided to bestow this name on this Spatial Celestial Tool. He repeated this name a few times, and thought that this name was really not bad. He was really pleased with it.

“However, it still cannot compare to the Black Tower yet.”

The Black Tower could shrink as he willed it, turning into a mote of dust, a mustard seed, but the Celestial Guest Residence still could not change its size for now.

“In terms of tool refinement, I still have a long way to go.”

Though the Celestial Guest Residence could not freely change its size, which was a disadvantage, Ling Han was already relatively satisfied. He’d just have to work the rest out step by step in the future.

And after so many years, his cultivation level had also considerably improved. That was because every time he acted, it did not always mean he could escape successfully. There were a great many times that he had been hunted down by Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, and he had only managed to escape after expending an astronomical amount of effort.

Continuously roaming the border between life and death, tempering himself amidst danger, the rate of his cultivation was naturally speedy.

And added with the fact that there was a large amount of Celestial medicines here, the present Ling Han had already pushed the cultivation level of Fourth Heaven to the third step.

It had happened in a mere 10,000 years. Going by this kind of calculation, he would be able to break through to the Fifth Heaven in another 20-30 thousand years. This speed was astonishingly rapid.

And in these past 10 millennia, a great many major events had happened. A colossal alliance had taken form, and it was called the Desolate Moon Alliance.

Ghost King City belonged to the Desolate Moon Alliance, and the Alliance Leader was a mysterious elite who went by the name Desolate Moon. It was rumored that at least one-third of the forces here in the Celestial King Graveyard had already fallen under the jurisdiction of the Desolate Moon Alliance by now.

This compelled the other forces to have no choice but to gather together. Otherwise, wherever the blade of the Desolate Moon Alliance pointed towards, who would be able to put up any resistance?

Thankfully, the internal structure of the Desolate Moon Alliance was considerably lax. Desolate Moon did not demand that every single force had to pledge their complete loyalty to him. Allies were only just allies as well. Perhaps all the forces had managed to quickly assimilate together as one precisely because of this.

Ling Han had long since released Zhao Shuang, but he made the latter believe that he had fallen for a great poison, and had to occasionally ingest the “antidote” to suppress the poison. He was a very good spy.

How could Zhao Yuanyi suspect his own son? Hence, Ling Han easily came to know a great many secrets, and also precisely due to this had Ling Han avoided the traps that were deliberately laid out by the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings a great many times.

On this day, Zhao Shuang had come to retrieve the “antidote” as per usual.

“Brother Long, I have found out some great information again.” Zhao Shuang had completely lost all his temper by now. Furthermore, he was already one of the most well-known profligates in Ghost King City by now, and this was all thanks to Ling Han.

Ling Han asked, “Oh, what information?”

“Do you remember? A very long time ago, I said that my father and the others had been willing to join the Desolate Moon Alliance. Firstly, it is because of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, and secondly, it is due to the Ancient Tomb. Once there are enough Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings gathered together, it can be opened. There are astonishing treasures that lie within,” Zhao Shuang said.

“En.” Ling Han nodded.

“Previously, Lu Gaojian received word, and informed my father that they would set out for the Ancient Tomb 10 days later.” Zhao Shuang had indeed revealed an important piece of information.

Ling Han was instantly moved, and asked, “10 days?”

“Brother Long, are you going?” Zhao Shuang asked. The underlying message was: ‘If you are planning to go, please help remove this poison from me. I feel uneasy and anxious every single day. I really am about to break down.’

Ling Han grinned. “Of course.” He patted Zhao Shuang’s shoulder. “In the future, don’t do too many despicable deeds.”

“Yes, yes, yes,” Zhao Shuang nodded hurriedly. “Er, Brother Long, about the permanent antidote?”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
