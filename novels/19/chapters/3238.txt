3239 Beast tide
What? There were so many enemies that they could not be counted?

Lian Xuerong bent her legs slightly and then suddenly burst out with astonishing strength. Peng, like a meteor, she darted towards that sentry tower.

She looked into the distance and her expression immediately changed. She shouted down, “Prepare for battle. The beast tide is coming!”

Beast tide, it was actually a beast tide.

Ling Han was astonished. Previously, he had been wondering what kind of disaster would be striking on this day.

Perhaps it was a terrifying weapon of mass destruction, such as the strongest nuclear bomb from more than a hundred years ago. If that one fell, Huju City would no longer exist. However, all these weapons had long been collected by the Dark North Majestic Empire, and it was impossible for anyone to take it out.

—if it really appeared, it meant that this force really had extraordinary abilities.

The other possibility was to mobilize an army that far exceeded Huju City. Otherwise, with the advantage of city defense, they would only be courting death.

Moreover, this had to be a crushing advantage. Otherwise, as long as they were delayed for two days, reinforcements would arrive. Similarly, they would not be able to destroy the city.

Thus, Ling Han had been wondering how he could Huju City could be turned into a land of death.

So it was a beast tide.

However, the problem was that a beast tide was naturally initiated by Demonic Beasts. High-level Demonic Beasts could command low-level ones, and only after a certain scale was formed could it be called a beast tide. If there were a few hundred of them, it could only be considered a small scuffle, not a tide.

It was very rare for humans and Demonic Beasts to get along harmoniously. Even among Demonic Beasts, as long as their races were different, they would kill each other.

Therefore, the probability of a beast tide appearing was extremely low. That was unless a Demonic Beast with extraordinary abilities appeared and took command of a group of beasts; then, there was a possibility of a beast tide forming. Therefore, this should not be engineered.

That mysterious force was too terrifying. They could even unleash a beast tide?

With this thought in mind, Ling Han had already taken out the broken sword, and said, “Huan Xue, follow behind me and don’t fall behind!”

“Yes, Young Master!” Huan Xue hugged the little pink pig tightly. She didn’t know what the words ‘beast tide’ meant, but seeing everyone’s extremely nervous expressions, she was also affected and became very nervous.

“Gu!” The lecherous pig let out a miserable cry. That was because it was held too tightly by Huan Xue; its neck was about to break.

“Ignore it, it’s just pretending,” Ling Han said casually, looking ahead.

The little pink piggy looked at him with hatred. What a detestable fellow. He kept interrupting its cute and pitiful act.

Rumble, the ground shook. The densely packed trees in front of them fell in large numbers. The beast tide was about to arrive.

BANG!

The bushes at the front collapsed, and a huge white rhinoceros that was fifteen metres long rushed out. It landed heavily on the ground with an indestructible force, causing the ground to tremble.

Peng, peng, peng, more Demonic Beasts rushed out from behind it. There were colorful tigers, green goats, and thick and long pythons. There were all kinds of them, and each of them had an ominous glint in their eyes.

“Electromagnetic Cannon!” Lian Xuerong shouted softly. Instantly, five lightning pillars shot out.

These pillars of light were so think that a man could wrap his arms around one, and their range was at least 1,000 meters. Their power was incomparably terrifying, and when the pillars of light touched them, those Demonic Beasts immediately exploded.

The beams of light shot out, and lasted for a full two seconds, forming an unusually long beam of light. With this strike, at least two to three hundred Demonic Beasts were killed.

“Recharge!” Lian Xuerong continued to issue orders. “Team two, go.”

Hong, another five beams of light shot out and intersected with each other.

In just two waves of attacks, thousands of Demonic Beasts had died.

“Team three.”

“Team four.”

The Xuanqing Banner had a total of 20 Electromagnetic Cannons, which were divided into four groups. This was because the Electromagnetic Cannons needed to be recharged after being used, and the recharge time was as long as 10 minutes. Naturally, it was impossible to push them all out at once.

However, there were too many in the beast tide. Even if the Electromagnetic Cannons were divided into four groups, they were still all used up in four minutes.

In other words, for the Electromagnetic Cannon to work again, one would still have to wait six minutes.

By this time, it would be far too late.
Boom, countless Demonic Beasts charged over and crushed towards the Xuanqing Banner.

“Kill!” Lian Xuerong stood at the front and took out her whip.

Ling Han also walked to the front. His strength was comparable to Lian Xuerong’s, so he naturally couldn’t hide at the back.

The first Demonic Beast had already rushed over. It was a large dog with a strange appearance. Its head was extremely small, but its body was incomparably huge.

Twelve Meridians.

Ling Han made a judgment in his heart. He brandished the broken sword, and there was no need to activate it at all. With a slash of the sword, that Demonic Beast had already been forcefully sliced into two.

It did not take much effort at all.

Ling Han knew that this would be a protracted battle, and he needed to conserve as much power as possible.

“Charge!”

The warriors of the Xuanqing Banner roared and drew their swords to face the beast tide.

With Ling Han and Lian Xuerong acting as the arrowheads, the pressure on the others was greatly reduced. Moreover, the main force of the beast tide was only at the Meridian Opening Tier, so they would have no problems for the time being.

Hong, the beast tide surged past, and most of the Demonic Beasts continued to surge towards the city. How could a team of a mere 100 people detain too many Demonic Beasts?

“Oh no!” Lian Xuerong exclaimed.

The Electromagnetic Cannon needed to be recharged, so it could only be recharged at a fixed location, some distance away from them. Therefore, when it was attacked by a Demonic Beast, the recharging equipment was immediately destroyed.

“Not good, the Demonic Beasts are going to invade the city!”

“Retreat to the city!”

“Ling Han, you take the lead,” Lian Xuerong said.

“Alright.” Ling Han didn’t say anything else, and immediately leaped out, arriving at the rear of the entire group. With a turn of his body, he became the vanguard.

“Forward with me!” he shouted.

“Understood!”

They pushed forward, but the Demonic Beasts continued to charge forward, greatly affecting their speed.

“At this rate, it will take us at least an hour to reach the city,” Lian Xuerong said.

If such a terrifying beast tide surged into the city, how terrifying would the damage be in an hour?

Ling Han also frowned. No wonder the little old man wanted him to leave, and Zha Deyuan even said that he would not be able to escape death even if he returned to Huju City. The number of these Demonic Beasts was endless, but there would be a limit to their manpower. Even they could block the next wave or two waves, then what about ten or twenty waves?

BANG!

A huge tremor sounded, as if there was an earthquake. Then, there was a commotion from behind.

Ling Han turned to look, and couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression.

It was a mammoth, a true mammoth. It was more than ninety meters tall, and each of its legs was as thick as a house. Every step it took shook the earth and mountains.

With such a terrifying physique, even if its cultivation wasn’t too high, just its physical strength was already incomparably terrifying. Even Extreme Bone Tier elites would be left speechless, right?

Hong, although this giant elephant’s steps seemed to be slow, because its legs were really too long, every step it took covered a distance of over three hundred metres.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In just a few steps, the giant elephant’s huge foot stepped towards them.

The black mass seemed to cover the sky and earth.
