“Little girl, just leave.” Hu Can waved his hand.

Lian Xuerong nodded and said, “Alright, as long as Clan Leader Hu hands these two over to me, I will leave immediately.”

“Hahaha!” Hu Can laughed loudly, but his expression was extremely cold.

He stopped laughing and said coldly, “Banner Lord Lian, your request is too much. Looks like I can only take you down first!”

Hu Can was very decisive. Once he decided to attack, he pounced without any hesitation.

Hong, his blood and Qi surged into the sky, turning into a crystal-colored human figure.

‘What!’

Lian Xuerong turned pale with fright. This was Condensed Blood Figure.

Fourth Change, Condensed Blood Weapon, Fifth Change, Condensed Blood Figure.

Hu Can was not a Fourth Change, but a Fifth Change!

This was bad.

Lian Xuerong’s blood and Qi boiled, instantly increasing her power by three times.

When Blood Transformation Tier cultivators erupted, they could increase their power by two to three times. As for how much, it would depend on many factors, such as the foundation laid in the Meridian Opening Tier, or the quality of the cultivation technique they cultivated.

In reality, not many people could achieve such an extreme burst of power of three times, and the requirements were too high. Ordinary Blood Transformation Tier elites could only unleash twice the power, and those who could achieve two and a half times the power could definitely be considered prodigy-level.

However, Lian Xuerong’s explosive power had reached 2.6 times.

BANG!

Hu Can and Lian Xuerong exchanged a blow. Both of their bodies trembled as they fought to a draw.

At first glance, Lian Xuerong didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage at all. However, she only had such strength because her blood and Qi boiled and erupted. Naturally, she was far inferior to Hu Can.

“As expected of Banner Lord Lian!” Hu Can nodded. “Becoming a Banner Lord of one of the Four Great Banners at such a young age, your power has increased by more than 2.5 times, right?”

Lian Xuerong nodded slowly. “2.6 times.”

Lian Xuerong remained silent. The other party was right. It was impossible for her to take Ling Han and Huan Xue away. However, she would definitely not agree if she were to leave just like that.

Ling Han nodded to himself. Although Lian Xuerong was usually cold, when it came to dealing with subordinates, there was indeed nothing to criticize. She was a good superior.

“Then don’t blame me for being impolite!” Hu Can attacked again. Boom, he leaped over, emitting a terrifying sonic boom. The sound waves reverberated. Peng, peng, peng. The surrounding chairs were all sent flying.

The speed of his pounce had already reached the speed of sound. Otherwise, it would be impossible for there to be a sonic boom.

It wasn’t strange for the speed of punches, palm strikes, and swords to in fact exceed the speed of sound, but it was astonishing for the actual body to reach the speed of sound.

This was because this had a terrifying requirement on one’s physique. Otherwise, even if one could unleash such a high speed, one’s body would still fall apart in the process of running. Their flesh and bones would be torn apart, and it would be a tragic sight.

Therefore, the fact that Hu Can’s physical body could accelerate to the speed of sound meant that his physique was even more terrifying than metal forged from refined iron.

Lian Xuerong hurriedly made her move. Facing such a great enemy, she couldn’t be careless at all.

“Haha. Banner Lord Lian, you are still too inexperienced,” Hu Can said as he attacked. The human figure formed by his blood and Qi was also continuously pouncing at Lian Xuerong. This was a pressure on the spiritual level, not a physical attack. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, it was precisely because this was a pressure on the spiritual level that it was impossible to dodge.

Lian Xuerong also released her blood and Qi which transformed into a three-legged bird. She fought fiercely with the figure formed from Hu Can’s blood and Qi, but there was a gap of two small cultivation levels between them. The disparity was too great, and the three-legged bird was quickly torn apart, causing Lian Xuerong’s pretty face to turn pale.

If one’s spirit suffered a setback, it would naturally affect one’s body. If it was serious, it was not impossible for one to faint.

This was a suppression of cultivation level!

Lian Xuerong displayed a strong toughness. Even though her head was splitting right now, it didn’t affect much of her battle prowess, and she still resisted tenaciously.

Hu Can sneered. Boom! Crystal-colored blood and Qi spewed out of his body, and his power instantly rose to a new height.

His blood and Qi was boiling as well.

A Fifth Change elite, and with his blood and Qi boiling, just how terrifying was his battle prowess?

Lian Xuerong immediately felt immense pressure. The situation took a turn for the worse, and she was at a complete disadvantage.

“Suppress!” Hu Can roared and pressed his palm down, the force changing into a myriad of forms.

This was a great move to suppress Lian Xuerong.

How could a Third Change defend against the eruption of a Fifth Change elite?

Just as Lian Xuerong was about to be suppressed, a golden shadow shot out like a snake and coiled around Hu Can.

Hu Can hurriedly retreated, dodging the golden snake’s attack.

A golden whip appeared in Lian Xuerong’s hand. Symbols were glowing.

A Spirit Tool could greatly increase a cultivator’s battle prowess. With or without a Spirit Tool, it might be two different levels of battle prowess.

“Clan Leader Hu, please let me take my men and leave!” Lian Xuerong said lightly, but with an indescribable determination.

“What a joke. Having killed someone in my Hu Clan, and you want to leave just like that?” Hu Can sneered. “Lian Xuerong, you think too highly of yourself. Do you think you’re the only one with a Spirit Tool?”

“Third Brother, go get the Spirit Tool!”

“Understood!” Hu Chaosheng immediately ran into the inner hall.

“Ling Han, hurry up and leave!” Lian Xuerong said. Now was the best time to leave. Otherwise, once Hu Can also had a Spirit Tool, she would still be no match for him.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Banner Lord, Hu Qiu snatched my maidservant, and I came to demand for her return, and I was even targeted by them. They wanted to beat me up and kill me, so I executed Hu Qiu on the spot. However, the Hu Clan’s attitude is actually still like this, without the slightest bit of repentance. I think that they should all be incarcerated!”

Incarcerate your head! You’re about to lose your life!

Lian Xuerong was speechless. How did this freakishly talented subordinate of hers become so stupid?

“Ha, hahaha!” Hu Can sneered. “Captain Ling really hates evil! Unfortunately, your sense of justice will only cost you your life!”

“Ling Han!” Lian Xuerong raised her voice.

Ling Han stepped forward, and said, “Banner Lord, help me look after Huan Xue. This place… I’ll take care of it!”

‘You will take care of it?’

What could he use to settle it? He was only in the Meridian Opening Tier!

Lian Xuerong was speechless. Why was this guy so confident?

“Young man, you have to know how to restrain yourself. Don’t be too arrogant!” Hu Can said coldly. At this moment, Hu Chaosheng had already returned and handed over a sword.

“Unfortunately, you won’t have the chance to learn your lesson!” He stared at Ling Han, the longsword in his hand flashing with a cold light.
