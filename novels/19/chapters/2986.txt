2987 Scared Away

Golden Silk Moth was naturally appalled at the idea of referring to Ling Han as master. He silently swore to himself that if Ling Han ever fell into his hands, he would definitely torture Ling Han until the latter regretted the decisions that he made today.

If he didn’t kill Ling Han, then he wouldn’t deserve to be an insect!

Ling Han looked at him with a smile of ridicule. “Are you daydreaming about all the things that you’d do to me if you managed to escape and even become more powerful than me in the future?”

“That’s right,” Golden Silk Moth replied without any sense of apprehension. Even though he was being suppressed, he possessed an invincible physique, which meant that he didn’t need to worry about being wounded or killed. That being the case, what was there to be afraid of?

Ling Han gave a sinister chuckle.

‘You think I can’t deal with you?’

“Where is the nearest toilet? Let me suppress this little insect there for 10,000 years first,” he murmured to himself.

‘Holy! F*ck!’

It was as if Golden Silk Moth had become stupid at this moment. ‘What? You actually want to suppress me in a toilet for 10,000 years?’

Even though he wouldn’t suffer a single wound from this, just thinking about it gave him the chills.

To say nothing of a Seventh Tier elite, even ordinary mortals wouldn’t be able to withstand such humiliation.

“You dare? You dare? You dare?!” he roared again and again. Golden Silk Moth finally lost his cool.

“Why wouldn’t I dare? But there’s no toilet here, so you can count yourself lucky. When we get back to the Profound Negative Realm, though, I’ll be sure to let you enjoy yourself,” Ling Han snickered.

Golden Silk Moth unleashed a barrage of profanity and curses at Ling Han—apart from this, there was nothing else he could do. However, how many Heavenly Venerates were skilled at cursing people? Generally speaking, they would directly attack anyone who dared to offend or provoke them. Thus, Golden Silk Moth repeated the same old curses again and again. Ling Han couldn’t help but shake his head in disappointment. This was far too tame and unimaginative.

“And you call yourself a Seventh Tier elite? You don’t even know how to curse people! How weak!”

Golden Silk Moth was instantly stifled upon hearing this. He didn’t curse anymore, and he simply treated Ling Han as if he were empty air.

Ling Han held Golden Silk Moth in his hand as he continued to search for veins of ore.

From time to time, he would use a bit of power to restrict Golden Silk Moth. This was a Seventh Tier elite, after all, someone who was indestructible and undying. As such, it was necessary for Ling Han to continually suppress Golden Silk Moth with power that far exceeded what the insect could wield now. Otherwise, Golden Silk Moth would be able to escape with ease and perhaps even launch a counterattack and severely wound him.

If that were the case, then Ling Han would essentially be carrying a ticking time bomb with him. What would be the point of that?

To Ling Han, this was indeed a very good opportunity to train himself. He would have to remain vigilant and battle-ready the entire time, and he was sure that this would put enough pressure on him to accelerate his cultivation speed even more.

After looking around for a while, Ling Han quickly reaped some rewards again. He ate the Great Herbs as if he were eating vegetables.

Heavenly Venerable Stones were able to cut off one’s divine sense, and even Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were no exception to this rule, so how was Ling Han managing to do this?

He continued to battle with Ling Han. He was trying to break free, while Ling Han was trying to keep him suppressed.

Even though Golden Silk Moth was imprisoned, it was actually he who was enjoying the advantage at this moment. This was because Ling Han had to continuously expend energy to keep him imprisoned. Meanwhile, he could break free if Ling Han lost concentration for just a single second.

In this way, 300 years quickly passed.

‘It’s about time.’ Ling Han planned to enter the next dimension.

‘Hmm?’

He faltered for a brief moment. Another aura was rushing over, and this was an extremely powerful and domineering aura.

It was another newly advanced Seventh Tier elite. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the blink of an eye, this person appeared before Ling Han.

Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows.

‘Huh? He actually advanced to the Seventh Tier as well?’

A while ago, both Ten Thousand Shadows and Ling Han had set their sights on the same core fragment. In the end, Ling Han had obtained it, and Ten Thousand Shadows hadn’t dared to battle him for it. Instead, he had directly fled. Ling Han had thought that after Ten Thousand Shadows lost this great opportunity, he wouldn’t be able to obtain another core fragment.

‘Who would’ve thought? He actually advanced to the Seventh Tier.

‘Did he rely on his own strength? Or did he use some other means to obtain this core fragment?’

“Golden Silk Moth!” Ten Thousand Shadows exclaimed.

He had initially been peering down at Ling Han in a haughty manner, but when he saw the golden silkworm in Ling Han’s hand, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets in shock and disbelief.

F*ck! Was he seeing things?

As a mighty Seventh Tier ultimate elite, Golden Silk Moth was actually being held in Ling Han’s hand like a pet?

This… No matter who saw this, they would definitely feel like they were seeing things, right?

Meanwhile, Golden Silk Moth was so embarrassed and humiliated that he wanted to die. It was all over… His glorious reputation was ruined forever!

He had initially hoped to break free before they came across anyone else. That way, no one would know about this dark period of time as long as he didn’t mention it.

Now, however…

His hopes vanished in a puff of smoke.

One could imagine Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows’ astonishment at this moment. When he first saw Ling Han just then, he had naturally peered down at him with a sense of superiority. Seventh Tier elites were the most powerful and invincible beings in the world, after all. Thus, he naturally didn’t need to be afraid of Ling Han anymore. He would no longer need to flee with his tail between his legs.

Now, however, he knew that he was wrong—very wrong.

So what if Seventh Tier elites couldn’t be killed? They could still be suppressed just like anyone else.

“You’ve come at just the right time. Come on, go and keep your good friend company.” Ling Han chuckled. He reached over with his right hand, grabbing at Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows.

At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows once again demonstrated the meaning of the word “resolute.”

He turned around and unleashed six fundamental powers, transforming into a gust of wind as he whooshed into the distance, disappearing without a trace.

In terms of traveling through the void, no one could rival Ling Han apart from Hysteria. In terms of traveling around a dimension, however, Ling Han was naturally no match for Seventh Tier elites.

Ling Han didn’t give chase. In any case, it would be impossible for him to both suppress Golden Silk Moth and chase Ten Thousand Shadows at the same time. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t have the ability to. If he tried, the result would inevitably be Golden Silk Moth breaking free and Ling Han having to flee from the joint attacks of Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows instead.

Ten Thousand Shadows was scared away.

However, this was only natural. He was still deeply traumatized by Ling Han, so how could he not lose his fighting spirit after seeing Golden Silk Moth, a fellow Seventh Tier elite, being suppressed by Ling Han? As such, he had resolutely chosen to flee. He didn’t want to become the second Seventh Tier elite to be captured by Ling Han.

Golden Silk Moth was also astounded. Ten Thousand Shadows fled just like that?!

Was he really a Seventh Tier ultimate elite?

However, he knew that he was the one to blame. Who told him to get captured? Who told him to create history for the Seventh Tier elites?

Ten Thousand Shadows was as strong as Golden Silk Moth. Since Golden Silk Moth had already been captured by Ling Han, this meant that… Ten Thousand Shadows was also definitely no match for Ling Han.

‘That stupid fool… Why didn’t he think about it another way? Since there are two of us, and since both of us are undying, will we still be unable to defeat Ling Han?’

“Heh, very disappointed, aren’t you?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Golden Silk Moth didn’t reply. This brat wouldn’t be able to act so smugly for much longer. Once Chong Yan and the others learned about this, they would definitely come to look for Ling Han.

A subordinate of Hysteria imprisoning a Seventh Tier elite? They definitely wouldn’t tolerate this.

It wouldn’t be long before the Seventh Tier elites started rushing over to save him.

Even though this would stain his reputation forever, it was still better than being imprisoned by Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled, and he naturally knew what Golden Silk Moth was thinking at this moment. However, he couldn’t be bothered taunting him anymore. As he grew stronger, Golden Silk Moth would only feel increasing despair and helplessness.

Ling Han entered the next dimension, but this was a dimension that he had already visited before. He had come here through the spatial passageway.

He continued onward.

Ling Han continued to visit veins of ore. At the same time, he also concealed his tracks as carefully as he could. He had already imprisoned a Seventh Tier elite, so he would definitely be at a disadvantage if he were to battle another Seventh Tier elite, regardless of their battle prowess.
