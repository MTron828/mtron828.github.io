2854 You bet, you pay, slain!

“It’s scrap.” Niu Buqun’s raw stone had to be opened up first, but nothing came out of it, and it was worthless. Even after every layer of stone had been peeled off, there still was nothing there.

Niu Buqun and Leng Xiuran were both disappointed, but they kept comforting themselves internally. The possibility of Ling Han opening up a scrap stone was also quite high, and even if it wasn’t a scrap stone, it was still impossible to reverse his defeat by unearthing a piece of Divine Metal.

The stonecutter continued slashing his blade with extreme care, and a hint of Primal Chaos appeared very soon within the stone, looking as if mist.

“No way!” everyone exclaimed.

“Another Heavenly Venerable Seal?”

“Goodness, how many years had it been that no Heavenly Venerable Seal had appeared here, and now there are actually two?”

“This guy’s luck is heaven-defying indeed, isn’t it?”

“Not necessarily, perhaps he really possesses such an ability?”

Everyone was amazed. It was fine to say that you were lucky once, but twice in a row? Then it wouldn’t be something that could be explained by luck, but rather the person’s strength.

“Could it be that this guy is truly a grandmaster of raw stone?”

On the other side, Leng Xiuran’s face turned pale. He was betting his life against Ling Han.

Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate’s eyes lit up. Two Heavenly Venerable Seals? Hahaha, then he would have reaped quite a good harvest.

“I have lost,” Niu Buqun said bluntly. Facts spoke louder than words—one Heavenly Venerable Seal was sufficient to reverse the slight advantage that he had previously possessed.

Anyway, he was merely selecting a stone on behalf of another. Although losing was embarrassing, there was no real loss for him after all. There was no need for him to kowtow again, and he didn’t need to pay with his life. Of course, he would never let Ling Han go so easily.

This guy was obviously also a grandmaster of raw stone, and yet acted as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, completely deceiving him.

Later, he would go find his senior brother to bet against Ling Han with stones once again. He simply didn’t believe that he wouldn’t win the bet against him.

Ling Han stretched out his hand to seize his prize, and all the medicine that Niu Buqun had unearthed earlier fell into his hands—the winner took all.

He looked at Leng Xiuran. “You may kill yourself now.”

Leng Xiuran trembled all over. How long did it take him to cultivate to the position of Heavenly Venerate, transcending the common world, and becoming able to supersede the Regulations? How could he be willing to die?

“I can give you a Heavenly Venerable Seal in exchange for my life,” he said.

Ling Han shook his head. “This isn’t what we had bet on.”

“Don’t be too overbearing!” Leng Xiuran gritted his teeth. He was a Heavenly Venerate, after all. Was the life of a Heavenly Venerate so worthless?

“Hehe, let me say something,” the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate suddenly spoke up. “Where it is possible to let people off, one should spare them. Ling Han, for my sake, just treat the bet on his life as a joke. Anyway, you also have gained a lot.”

Leng Xiuran was overjoyed, and quickly clasped his fists in respect towards the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate. “Thank you, milord.” He vaguely remembered that the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate had a friendly relationship with his father, but it was too long ago, and he had only just realized it.

A Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate had spoken up already; how could it be that Ling Han would dare to not give him face? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Han looked at the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate, and said indifferently, “What does this matter have to do with you?”

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate frowned. “I am simply asking you to give me face on this matter, are you not willing to do so?”

Ling Han shook his head. “Firstly, I don’t want to give it anyway, and secondly, you don’t deserve to be given this much face.”

‘What?!’

The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate was taken aback for a moment. He’d never thought that Ling Han would reject him.

Ling Han was merely a Second Tier, while the Great Clouds was two cultivation levels above him. It would be like a grandfather beating a grandson; how could Ling Han have the confidence to refuse?

“Fine! Fine! Fine!” Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate sneered. “I insist on interfering in this matter. I would like to see how you can commit a crime in my face.”

Ling Han looked at the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate. “Then the person to die… will be more than one.”

“Ha!” Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate sneered. This was funny indeed; a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dared to threaten him? He was practically seeking death!

“Leng Xiuran, you may take your leave. I don’t believe that anyone will dare to hurt you,” the Great Clouds said to Leng Xiuran.

Leng Xiuran nodded. He didn’t say anything further, as only his father would be qualified to repay this favor. He just needed to accept it.

Ling Han moved, and intercepted Leng Xiuran.

“Humph!” The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate sneered. “If you dare to make a move here, you’ll see how I’m going to crush you!”

Why was an elite of Fourth Tier placed in charge here?

Naturally, it was to oversee the territory. If someone was to seize the raw stone and run away with it, could it be that someone from other raw stone lanes was needed to stop it? One naturally ought to resolve one’s own affairs internally, unless it would affect others.

Ling Han directly channeled the Fourteenth Seal, boosting his power by 47 times. In an instant, endless power burst forth within him.

Peng!

He punched out, dispersed the blow of the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate, and instantly caught up with Leng Xiuran, without pausing in the slightest. He stretched out his right hand, and grabbed the other party’s neck.

Leng Xiuran was shocked. How could he have imagined that even a move by an elite of the Fourth Tier would not be able to stop Ling Han?

He wanted to dodge or block the attack, but he was like an ant in front of Ling Han.

Teng, teng, teng, The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate retreated 17 steps consecutively before finally regaining his footing, but Leng Xiuran had already fallen into Ling Han’s hands, and was being held like a dead dog.

A First Tier Heavenly Venerate?

It was a joke!

There was the sound of sighing all around, and some people were so shocked that their mouths fell open and couldn’t be closed.

What was happening?

A dignified Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate was actually pushed back by a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Although everyone knew that Ling Han was a freak who had previously broken records repeatedly, witnessing this unbelievable scene with their own eyes still caused everyone to go numb with shock. At this moment, it was difficult to believe indeed.

“Is this… the peerless freak?”

“He has surpassed two cultivation levels!”

...

“I think that even Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang… Could they have such battle prowess when they were Second Tier Heavenly Venerates?”

Ling Han actually didn’t even glance at the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate. A Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate could only fight him to a draw at most, and furthermore, trash like the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate only made him feel disdainful. He merely gazed at Leng Xiuran, and said indifferently, “No one is exempt from repaying a debt owed to me!”

Leng Xiuran felt chills all over his body. What kind of freak was Ling Han that even a Fourth Tier couldn’t even suppress him? Leng Xiuran initially wanted to intimidate Ling Han with his father’s name, but even the Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate was no match for Ling Han, so what was the use of his father’s name?

“Spare me, spare me!” he tremblingly said. After losing his trump card, and if he still didn’t want to die, the only way out would be to beg for mercy.

“You bet, you pay,” Ling Han said lightly as a destructive force surged out of his right hand, instantly obliterating Leng Xiuran’s life. Immediately, a majestic force flowed into Ling Han’s body, turning into nourishment for him.

Here it was again.

Ling Han frowned slightly. Of course, it was a good thing that his cultivation level could be increased speedily, but this ability was too weird. He still couldn’t pinpoint the reason, but it made him feel uneasy from the bottom of his heart.

“Fine! Fine! Fine!” The Great Clouds Heavenly Venerate looked at Ling Han intensely. He sensed that Ling Han’s power could crush him, and it was all because the other party could channel Heavenly Venerable Seals that were of much higher levels than him.

This could only be said to be explosive power. If he couldn’t obliterate this person in seconds, the rest would depend on the usual battle prowess in the end.

He was confident that as long as he persevered through Ling Han’s burst of power, he would be able to suppress this freak who was younger than him by who knew many years.

“Brat, only one of us can live!” he spat out word by word.
