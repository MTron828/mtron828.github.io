3041 Torture them one by one

Ling Han made his move. His figure transformed into a gust of wind as he charged toward Chong Yan.

Just as the large black dog and the others had said, he couldn’t keep targeting Shatter Mountains. He had to be fair and share his “favor” equally among them.

Ling Han charged over, and Chong Yan sneered. He also met Ling Han’s attack with a palm strike. He naturally had nothing to fear.

‘Old thief, prepare to be shocked.’

Ling Han abruptly channeled all the sixth-grade seals. Hong, his power suddenly increased by 3,000 times, and the Powers of Dimension surged, causing his power to instantly reach a level that could crush the peak stage of the Seventh Tier.

Peng!

Ling Han threw a punch, and Chong Yan’s palm strike was instantly tilted. It couldn’t withstand his punch at all, and this punch struck his face with unstoppable force.

Chong Yan immediately flew out like a kite with a broken string.

‘What?!’

The three ultimate elites—Big Dipper, Half Moon, and Mysterious Feather—were all shocked. They had not expected Ling Han’s battle prowess to actually reach such heights.

This was too terrifying. Chong Yan was actually at a disadvantage in terms of power, and it wasn’t just by a little bit.

Only Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had long expected this, and a sense of satisfaction at Chong Yan’s misfortune actually arose in his heart. He was finally not the only one who was unlucky.

However, after only being stunned for a moment, Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper and the others hurriedly swarmed forward. They couldn’t just watch Ling Han torture Chong Yan, right?

But so what if the four of them attacked together?

Ling Han’s current strength was completely overwhelming, and even if the five ultimate elites joined forces, they would still be no match for him.

Peng, peng, peng! Chong Yan instantly became a punching bag.

Ling Han sent Chong Yan flying with an uppercut. Then, he kicked down again, causing Chong Yan to shoot down rapidly.

Chong Yan roared. He was an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier, and now he was being beaten up in front of others. How could he endure this?

“There’s no need to feel bad. You’re not the first,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Bang! He kicked Chong Yan again, his blow landing between his legs.

This kick was so powerful that Chong Yan instantly disappeared.

Fortunately, his Seventh Tier physique was indestructible, or else his balls would definitely be shattered beyond repair by now.

Even so, Big Dipper and the other Heavenly Venerates couldn’t help but clamp their legs together, and a sense of pain arose in their balls. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains could empathize even more—he had been kicked in the balls more than once.

“Next.” Ling Han’s gaze swept across the faces of the Heavenly Venerates Big Dipper, Mysterious Feather, and Half Moon.

Why wasn’t he looking at Shatter Mountains?

Big Dipper and the other two immediately thought of what Ling Han had said before, and couldn’t help but come to a realization. Could it be that Shatter Mountains was the first victim?

They couldn’t help but look at Shatter Mountains with sympathy. Previously, they had seen Chong Yan being trampled on with their own eyes. His appearance was truly tragic.

Shatter Mountains couldn’t help but blush. “Why are you looking at me?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and charged towards Big Dipper. “I’ll choose you!”

The current Ling Han was too powerful, and even a peak-stage Seventh Tier would not be able to stop him.

Big Dipper was naturally unwilling to be humiliated. He channeled all his first-grade seals, and there were also eight dimensions!

As expected, Big Dipper had also mastered more dimensions. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was certain that they had definitely used some sort of method to divide up the dimensions in Feng Wuding’s body among themselves.

But so what?

Peng!

It was only a single strike, but Big Dipper was sent flying. Even if Mysterious Feather and the other ultimate elites went all out to help him, it was useless.

At this moment, Chong Yan had already charged back.

“Junior that deserves death!” His hair flew into the sky, and he was furious to the extreme.

Ling Han sneered, and said, “You’re quite old, and indeed deserve to die. As for me, you don’t have to think about me. You won’t be able to see the day that I die.”

Peng, peng, peng! Even if he was besieged by the five ultimate elites, he still pressed forward fiercely and focused his pummeling on Big Dipper.

After Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper was Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather, followed by Heavenly Venerate Half Moon. Ling Han was very fair, and every Heavenly Venerate had been beaten up once. It was really a fair practice, not favoring one over the others.

Ling Han only had an explosive period of two hours. Otherwise, every Heavenly Venerate would be beaten up for three days and three nights, and that still wouldn’t be enough to vent his anger.

Of course, he didn’t beat Shatter Mountains up again. He had already beaten him up eight times in a row.

“Old thieves, next time, it won’t be so simple!” Ling Han was satisfied. After venting his anger, it was as if he had obtained some kind of release, and his spirit had risen to a different level.

He believed that after this seclusion, he would definitely be able to break through to the Sixth Tier.

Without any hesitation, he tore a rip into the Void and left.

“Little thief, don’t even think about leaving!” The five ultimate elites hurriedly chased after him, but Ling Han still had a trace of residual power. With a single punch, he easily forced them back, and left calmly.

The five ultimate elites could only watch helplessly as Ling Han tore a rip into the Void and left.

Without dimensional coordinates, it was impossible for them to leave the Void. They could only return the way they came.

The five ultimate elites all stood still, and they looked at each other in silence.

After a very long time, Heavenly Venerate Half Moon finally said, “This child… is a great calamity!”

“Strange, according to the information we received, Feng Wuding was the Son of Destiny. Only he could kill Hysteria.”

“But looking at this kid’s freakishness, he seems to be more likely to kill Hysteria than Feng Wuding.”

“I thought that after Feng Wuding’s death, our plan would be impossible to achieve. However, I accidentally obtained some secrets from Feng Wuding, and obtained more Powers of Dimension.”

“This concerns whether we can obtain the World’s Core when the Genesis World is destroyed!”

“But this kid is constantly growing. It’s very likely that we’ll really be suppressed by that brat!”

The five ultimate elites all fell silent. So what now? What countermeasures could they come up with?

“We can only strengthen the dimensions we obtained as soon as possible. When the time comes, we can immediately facilitate the destruction of the Genesis World, plunder the World’s Core, and create our new legend.”

“Mm-hm!”

The five of them all nodded, but after a while, Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather opened his mouth, and said, “However, is the information we obtained regarding the World’s Core really correct? With the birth of Extermination, I keep feeling that I’ve fallen into some kind of scheme.”

“Humph, we are immortal and indestructible. Who can scheme against us?” Chong Yan said proudly.

The other four also slowly shook their heads. For someone as strong as them, how could anyone scheme against them?

***

Ling Han tore open the Void, but did not reappear in the Profound Negative Realm. Thus, he could only travel through the Void a few more times, and spent over a month before finally meeting up with the Empress and the others.

“I’m going into seclusion for a very long time,” Ling Han said.

“Okay.” The Empress and the others all nodded, and only Hu Niu hugged him coquettishly.

“Ling Han, Niu wants to play with you!” she said coquettishly.

Ling Han patted her shoulder, and said, “I’ll owe you this once. When I come out of seclusion, I’ll definitely accompany you, alright?”

“Humph, Ling Han, you’re very bad!” She became angry, and pouted.

Ling Han consoled this young wife of his, and then began his seclusion.

Just as he had said before, he had to advance to the Sixth Tier this time.

He sat cross-legged and began a long period of seclusion.

His mind was clear, as if it could connect to the heaven and earth. The myriad of dimensions in his body boiled at the same time.
