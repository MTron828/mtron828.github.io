2719 He Yufeng arrives

Ling Han somewhat looked down on these people.

What was there to be so proud of after merely surviving a wave of attack from Hysteria’s army? Indeed, being alive was something to be happy about, but to go so far as to throw a huge banquet, as if having won a great victory?

Ling Han believed that in the second and third spatial layers, there ought not be such a pompous and grandiose atmosphere.

He shook his head. He had initially wanted to see what Lou Tianqian was planning, but he ended up being utterly disappointed.

!!

It was merely for picking up girls.

“Let’s go.” Ling Han shook his head as he spoke to the Empress.

“Hey, what’s the hurry!” Someone stretched out his hand to stop him.

This wasn’t Lou Tianqian’s follower, but a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. He looked at Ling Han with a smile, but his eyes were full of disdain.

His name was Nong Gaolin. Not only was he himself a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, his father was also a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. His background was not beneath that of Lou Tianqian.

Of course Lou Tianqian wouldn’t just invite a few of his underlings—what kind of class would such a gathering have? Therefore, a prodigy like Nong Gaolin, who was on an equal footing with him, had been invited.

…It wouldn’t work for more prominent figures, though. Firstly, the person being invited might not give him face by attending. Secondly, even if they were to come, one would have to act humble to the other party. Being a host and yet being overwhelmed by the guest would only make him feel uncomfortable, so why bother?

Ling Han’s eyes turned cold. “Are you trying to provoke me?”

Infighting was forbidden here, but self-defense wasn’t prohibited, and the party who stirred up trouble would bear all the consequences.

“Haha, everyone here is a comrade-in-arms, so why ruin the friendly atmosphere?” Another person came out to play mediator. “Come, come, come, let’s all sit down, not everyone has arrived yet, so how can anyone want to leave now?”

“That’s right, there will be a lot of people coming this time. For example… He Yufeng who was ranked 862nd on the current list!

Ling Han originally wanted to leave, but when he heard He Yufeng’s name, he stopped in his tracks.

‘He Yufeng, finally we will see each other again.’

The Empress nodded towards Ling Han, indicating that everything would be up to him to decide.

Ling Han smiled, took the Empress’ hand, and walked forward.

Since he had decided to stay, of course he had to find the best seat for them to sit down.

Seeing Ling Han pulling the Empress and heading forward, everyone was surprised. Could it be that they actually wanted to sit at the large table?

Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates would sit at the large table, while the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would sit at the small table—this was a rule by tacit approval.

This brat was being too tactless. Did he really think he was the overlord here?

Lou Tianqian wanted to speak, but once again stopped himself.

He didn’t know what was the relationship between Lin Piaoxue and Ling Han and his group. To be on the safe side, it would be better not to let himself be the villain. Since Ling Han was being so arrogant, he would garner the dislike of others. Lou Tianqian just needed to watch the show; that was all.

In the future, even if Lin Piaoxue were to get upset, she wouldn’t be able to blame this on him. Who asked Ling Han to be so arrogant this time?

Correct, not only he couldn’t get angry, but he also had to try his best to appear to be protecting Ling Han so that Lin Piaoxue even had to be grateful to him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Haha, this would be a good idea.

Thinking about it this way, Lou Tianqian naturally wouldn’t speak anymore, and even suppressed what the people behind him were about to say with a stern look.

Ling Han pulled the Empress to the frontmost row, and then sat down together with her. There was already an exquisite fruit plate on the table, where the fruits were of vibrant colors, and they could smell its fragrance.

He helped the Empress peel off the skin of the fruit very attentively, and put the flesh of the fruit into the Empress’ mouth, while the Empress also smilingly opened her mouth and bit into it. Their affection was on full display.

F***.

At the sight of this scene, the group of people such as Nong Gaolin became very displeased. A pretty boy like you, relying on a woman to be arrogant and domineering, even so much as to show your affection in public—this was being too condescending indeed.

They sat down one after another, either beside Ling Han or behind him.

In fact, there were not that many large tables. Lou Tianqian only invited about 20 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, most of his guests being Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. These Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were held in the highest esteem and treated with reverence.

Given that there was a limited number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, the number of large tables corresponded. Once everyone was seated, there would be no empty seats—Ling Han had taken the seat that belonged to He Yufeng, and the latter hadn’t arrived yet.

There was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate who could not bear with it. A Ninth Heaven Celestial King was also worthy to be on an equal footing with them?

“What sort of status and ability do you have that you could stand side by side with us?” he said pensively. His eyes were looking at the sky, showing that he disdained Ling Han, and thought him to be completely beneath contempt.

Ling Han nodded. “Indeed, sitting with trash like you, I think it really devalued my status.”

The Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate stood up abruptly, pointing at Ling Han angrily. “You—”

“What, do you want to fight?” Ling Han smiled.

Lou Tianqian hurriedly stepped forward to mediate. “Both of you, please calm down! You…” He looked at Ling Han, but suddenly realized that he didn’t know the other party’s name, but neither did he bother to ask. “Just apologize to Brother Wu.”

Ling Han just glanced at Lou Tianqian with the kind of gaze like he was staring at an idiot.

Lou Tianqian was about to burst into anger, but when he thought of his previous plans, he forcibly endured it. “Your character like this… hehe, hehe.”

“Brother Lou, it seems that this person does not accept your kindness.” The “Brother Wu” from before was named Wu Yuanqing. He stared at Ling Han, thinking about how he could have a “spar” with Ling Han, and then use the opportunity to severely teach him a lesson.

Lou Tianqian just chuckled, and said, “I have some relationship with this person, so I had to persuade him.”

He just said that there was some relationship between them, but the underlying meaning was: if both of you really wanted to fight, then I would not stop either of you.

Wu Yuanqing, Nong Gaolin, and the others were all thinking about how to force Ling Han to “spar” with them, otherwise they would be seen as the strong bullying the weak for no reason, and they would be severely punished for it.

“Lord He Yufeng has arrived!” One person was heard shouting, breaking the silence here.

“He Yufeng!”

“Is it the He Yufeng who is on the recent leaderboard?”

“He is a real prodigy indeed, and his father is a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate!”

All of a sudden, everyone was getting a little excited. He Yufeng was absolutely the most prominent guest today.

A young man was seen walking forward with great strides. He obviously looked slender and not burly, but he exuded a majestic and cold-blooded aura, which caused people to involuntarily feel subdued by his superiority.

It was He Yufeng indeed.

“Brother He!” Lou Tianqian immediately stood up from the main seat, and walked over to receive him.

He Yufeng just nodded reservedly. In his opinion, this kind of banquet was not up to par, but he had quite an amiable personal relationship with Lou Tianqian, so it couldn’t be helped. Since the other party had spoken to invite him, he had no choice but to oblige and come to show support to the other party.

“Brother He, I’m really sorry. I made a mistake in arranging the seats earlier today. Why don’t you and I take the main seat together?” Lou Tianqian deliberately said.

“What’s going on?” He Yufeng asked. One could even make mistakes in arranging a seat?

“There, here is an ignorant guy who didn’t know what’s good for him. He’s obviously just a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, but he insists on sitting with Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. However, he seemed to have some sort of relationship with Celestial Maiden Lin, so I can’t say much,” Lou Tianqian said.

He Yufeng’s face turned black. Although there were many women surnamed Lin here, there seemed to be only one who could be addressed as a celestial maiden.

“Lin Piaoxue?” he said in a deep voice.

“That’s right.” Lou Tianqian nodded.

He Yufeng immediately strode forward, walked to the end of the large table, and saw that the person occupying his seat was none other than Ling Han.

“You are still as arrogant as expected!” He Yufeng said sharply, his eyes glowering with a cold light. Ling Han was someone he had to get rid of, with a level of freakishness that even surpassed his own.
