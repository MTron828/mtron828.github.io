“Damn criminal, die!” Another Enlightenment Tier elite leaped over and attacked Ling Han.

—The person that Ling Han had killed with a single punch just now was his Junior Brother.

Ling Han had no intention of wasting time, and directly drew out the battle hammer. Once it was activated, instantly, blazing white lightning flickered. He charged out. Peng, he killed that Enlightenment Tier elite with a single strike.

In the first place, his battle prowess was enough to crush those at Enlightenment Tier, and added with the might of a One Star Spirit Tool, he had completed an insta-kill.

This time, the young man surnamed Li and the others were shocked to the core.

Who would have thought that the punching bag they were looking for was actually a great demon king!

This time, they had met their match.

“Friend, we can talk things over peacefully.” The young man surnamed Li immediately softened.

How could Ling Han possibly give him any regard? He moved aggressively, and as he brandished the battle hammer, blazing lightning flashed madly. This was a One Star Spirit Tool. Though it could not display its full might, in Ling Han’s hands, it possessed the might of Mystery Realm Tier. Just how terrifying was that?

After being struck by the lightning, even Enlightenment Tier elites would feel their bodies go numb and lose the ability to dodge. After being struck by the battle hammer, they would naturally be blasted into a bloody mess.

!!..

Ling Han was expressionless as he continued to massacre his enemies.

One, two, three. The young man surnamed Li and the others totalled up to nine people, and very quickly, they were killed to the point that only one was left, and that was the young man surnamed Li.

This was naturally Ling Han’s deliberate action. He asked calmly, “What wrong have I done?”

“N-none,” the youth surnamed Li said with a shake of his head.

“Then why are you guys being so overbearing?” Ling Han asked.

The young man surnamed Li could not answer. They had failed in their attempt this time, and in order to maintain the stability of the team, as well as to vent their emotions of failure, they naturally needed a punching bag, and push the blame for their failure onto this punching bag.

Ling Han was their target. However, no one would have thought that this weakling who called himself Inscription Tier was actually a god of death.

Peng!

Ling Han swung his hammer, killing the youth surnamed Li.

His cold eyes swept over the others, and everyone was shocked, fearing that he would become aroused from killing, and view them as a target for slaughter as well.

Thankfully, Ling Han was not that kind of person.

“Haha, this hammer is not bad, I want it!” However, someone stepped out, and took the initiative to provoke Ling Han.

This was a Mystery Realm Tier elite, so he naturally wasn’t afraid of Ling Han.

“I want it too, so what are we supposed to do?” Another Mystery Realm Tier stood up.

“I’m also interested,” the third Mystery Realm Tier said with a smile.

“I…”

All the Mystery Realm Tier elites spoke up one after another. Counting, there were actually as many as eleven people.

Ling Han swept an eye over them, and said calmly, “Are you all shameless? Want to join forces against an Inscription Tier like me?”

“Haha, what kind of joke is that? You’re an Inscription Tier?” Everyone laughed loudly. Killing an Enlightenment Tier with a single hammer strike, even with the might of a Spirit Tool, Ling Han’s own strength was still frighteningly strong.

How could this be an Inscription Tier?Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Looks like these people were determined to gang up on him, disregarding their pride.

Ling Han’s figure moved, and with a step, he had instantly disappeared.

“What!”

“Where is he? Where did he go?”

Those Mystery Realm Tier elites all exclaimed in shock. This speed was really too fast, wasn’t it? He had disappeared in a single step, and they couldn’t even catch a trace of him.

“Damn it, he has a One Star Spirit Tool, and also grasped such a shocking movement technique. He must be the disciple of some great elite. If he managed to escape, there would be endless trouble in the future,” someone said regretfully.

“It’s fine. He has to ascend the mountain eventually, so we can just stand guard here.”

“That’s right. We’ll stop him here.”

These Mystery Realm Tier elites quickly reached a consensus. A One Star Spirit Tool was enough to make them feel killing intent.

In the distance, Ling Han had already stealthily returned.

Was he someone who was willing to suffer a loss?

Of course not.

Previously, he had left because he was outnumbered. There were really too many Mystery Realm Tier elites. Even with the might of the Spirit Tool, he would barely be able to stand against a single Mystery Realm Tier. If he was ganged up on by eleven Mystery Realm Tier elites, his end would definitely be a tragic death.

This time, his whole body was wrapped in the hide of the Void Beast, concealing his tracks and identity.

He quietly approached, and set his eyes on a Mystery Realm Tier elite.

Should he use the shard of the tombstone to smack him, so that he would be embroiled in bad luck, or directly blast him to death with the Heavenly Pattern Jade?

Ling Han thought for a moment, then decided to use the broken piece of the tombstone.

He approached again, and again, and arrived behind that person. Then, he smashed the piece of tombstone at him.

Previously, even Hong Tianbu had been hit, what more this kind of trash. Even if Hong Tianbu was only in Enlightenment Tier at the time, Hong Tianbu was still much stronger than him.

Peng!

That person did not even have the time to react. Immediately, he collapsed onto the ground, and there was a large bump on the back of his head.

“What’s going on?”

Everyone looked over. A Mystery Realm Tier had suddenly collapsed onto the ground; just how strange was this?

Looking at the large bump on the back of that person’s head, everyone was sure that he must have been struck from behind.

The problem was that no one had seen anyone make a move.

“It must be that brat!”

“He has an ability to conceal himself.”

“Everyone, back to back, form a circle.”

The few Mystery Realm Tier elites said one after another, and everyone hurriedly formed a circle.

Some Enlightenment Tier elites and Inscription Tier elites were gloomy. They didn’t offend Ling Han, yet they were kidnapped and brought into this team. How innocent were they?

It could not be helped. If they did not obey now, then wouldn’t they be offending these Mystery Realm Tier elites?

“Brat, come out if you can!” After forming a circle around them, a Mystery Realm Tier elite began to challenge from afar.

“Sneaking around, what kind of elite are you? Do you dare come out for a battle?”

“I’m not going to bully you, either. It’s a one-on-one battle.”

These people called out a challenge, yet did not get the slightest response from Ling Han.

After calling out for a while, these people’s mouths were also dry, and stopped to rest.

Right at this moment, shua, a flash of white light suddenly appeared, shooting towards a Mystery Realm Tier.

“Ha, you want to sneak attack me?” The Mystery Realm Tier elite sneered, and threw a punch at the white light.

The white light was very fast, and actually reached 11 times the speed of sound. However, the Mystery Realm Tier elite still managed to forcefully parry it. His fist was wrapped in high-level energy, and it was like a heavy hammer. No matter what this white light was, it was shattered with a single strike.

Peng, the white light arrived, and landed on the fist of the Mystery Realm Tier. Instantly, his fist exploded, and the white light didn’t even pause, continuing forwards. Then, this person’s whole body turned into a shower of blood.

Pa, pa, pa! Blood rained down on the people in the surroundings, and only then were they alerted. A Mystery Realm Tier elite had actually been beaten to burst.

Ling Han’s figure appeared. He grabbed the Heavenly Pattern Jade.

—The Void Beast hide and the Heavenly Pattern Jade was practically a perfect match. It allowed him to accumulate power calmly, and no one else would be able to see where this attack had come from. At a short distance of about fifteen meters, it could allow the Heavenly Pattern Jade to unleash its strongest might, and also cause his opponent to lack time to react.

Thus, with a single strike, a Mystery Realm Tier elite fell.

“You—” The remaining nine Mystery Realm Tier elites all glared at him. In a short while, one Mystery Realm Tier elite was knocked unconscious, while another was directly beaten to burst, so how could they not be furious yet feel panic as well?

Ling Han smiled faintly, took a step, and disappeared again..
