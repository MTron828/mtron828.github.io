Chapter 3496: Reinforcements move

Translator: Henyee Translations . Editor: Henyee Translations

Everyone turned around, only to see a woman in white flying over, her bearing unmatched.

The princess of the Demon Race!

Ling Han faltered upon hearing this. He hadn’t expected that Princess Bixiao would actually rush over.

Previously, he had thought that perhaps the older Imperial Princes could make a move. After all, this was the Imperial Capital, and also the territory of the Chen Clan, but now, it was the princess of the Demon Race that had run out.

“It’s Princess Bixiao!”

“How beautiful, as expected of the number one beauty!”

“Yi, why would Princess Bixiao fight for Ling Han? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Are you stupid? Don’t you know that they’re a couple? They’ve already spent the night together.”

“What, the goddess of my dreams!”

Everyone was discussing spiritedly, and the majority were grabbing their heads. Princess Bixiao was the dream lover of every man in the Imperial

Capital.

Ceng Ruixuan was also startled, then said with a smile, “So it is Princess Bixiao. You are indeed worthy of the name of a peerless beauty! However, Your imperial Highness, you are a member of the Demon Race, so it is not up to you to stand up for the Human Race, right?”

This Demon Race princess smiled faintly, “My Yue Empire has long since surrendered to the Dark North Nation, and the Demon Race is also a part of the Dark North Nation. And you all disobeyed the imperial decree, and ran amuck in the Imperial Capital. How could Bixiao just stand by and watch?”

“Good! Well said!”

“Good job, Princess Bixiao!”

“That’s right. You outsiders can do as you like in the Imperial Capital, and you still won’t allow us to resist?”

“It’s every man’s duty to attack foreign enemies!”

The people in the surroundings all called out, all of them hot-blooded and incredibly excited.

Princess Bixiao nodded at everyone, then said, “Moreover, you are a woman. If word gets out that our Dark North Nation bullied a woman, it would be a joke.

I, too, am a woman, so I will battle you.”

These words were even better said. It was clearly Ling Han’s cultivation level that was inferior, and battle prowess that was inferior, but in her mouth, it had become that Ling Han disdained from bullying a woman, which instantly made the image of Ling Han become lofty.

Ling Han was surprised. He had not thought that this princess of the Demon Race would be so eloquent. She could practically distort the facts, and this had quite a bit of his own style.

Ceng Ruixuan was speechless. She felt as if Princess Bixiao had already explained everything, so what else could she say?

‘Then let’s battle.’

“Please guide me, Your Imperial Highness.” She drew her sword.

Princess Bixiao also drew her sword, formed a hand seal, and said, “Please.” Xiu, xiu! The two women leaped, and immediately began an intense battle. They were both beauties, with captivating physiques and graceful postures.

This did not seem like a battle, but rather a dance, giving people a very high visual enjoyment.

After testing the waters a few times, their battle had reached a climax, and they both used their ultimate moves. Instantly, light burst out chaotically, and one after another, terrifying shockwaves of power shot out in all directions, causing those around them to hurriedly dodge, to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Wang Yu’s brow wrinkled into a frown as he watched, and this frown was becoming more and more pronounced.

With his insight, he could naturally tell that Ceng Ruixuan was now at a disadvantage, and defeat was only a matter of time.

This princess of the Demon Race was definitely a one-star genius. She had the aptitude to be invincible among her peers.

He was also a one-star genius. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been taken as disciple by Fei Yongsi. However, if he was faced with Princess Bixiao, the outcome of the battle was hard to predict.

Thinking of this, he suddenly stepped out, and said, “Ling Han, since you disdain from bullying women, then let me be your opponent.

When these words fell, everyone was stunned.

Do you still have any shame?

Did he really think that if Ling Han fought Ceng Ruixuan, that would be an act of bullying women?

Previously, Princess Bixiao had indeed said so, and now Wang Yu was using her words for his benefit. Though he was indeed shameless, similarly, this was shamelessness to the point that no one could refute him.

“Hehe, if you want to spar, I shall oblige!” A loud laugh rang out, and a tall figure appeared in the arena.

“Your Imperial Highness!”

Everyone cried out one after another. With an Imperial Prince taking the field, the significance of this battle was completely different again.

Wang Yu was startled. He had only come to force Ling Han to hand over the Young Dragon’s inheritance. Why had the princess of the Demon Race come first, and then an Imperial Prince of the Human Race had butted in?

He was just about to speak, yet a look of attentiveness appeared on his face. After a while, he nodded slowly, “Then, please guide me, Your Imperial

Highness.”

The Eldest Imperial Prince humphed, and with a leap, he had already launched

an attack at Wang Yu.

The two of them battled fiercely. After a slight test, they immediately began a fierce battle, using their ultimate moves one after another.

Wang Yu was a one-star genius. The Eldest Imperial Prince had an Innate Divine Physique. Even if this was in the lowest tier, a Divine Physique was stfll a Divine Physique, so he was naturally extremely powerful. The Eldest Imperial Prince was also a one-star genius. He possessed the aptitude to be invincible among his peers.

The two of them were invincible among their peers, so what could they do?

The so-called invincibility was only a kind of description, a kind of praise. Just like how a Sixth Extreme would definitely overwhelm a Fifth Extreme, but there would definitely be differences in strength among Sixth Extremes as well.

The two of them went all out. From a certain aspect, this was a battle between Chen Fengyan and Fei Yongsi, so naturally neither of them could afford to lose. They were all standing at the peak stage of tMystery Realm Tier, and were also one-star geniuses. Their abilities were extremely close, and after several hundred exchanges, the victor was still undecided. On the other side, the Demon Race Princess had defeated Ceng Ruixuan, winning another victory for the Dark North Nation.

Wang Yu was under immense pressure at this moment. If he lost, that would mean that they would be completely defeated today.

How could he accept this?

How could he bring himself to see others?

He roared, and his blood and Qi suddenly boiled. Then, he used a forbidden secret technique, and his battle prowess instantly soared. This could not be maintained for too long, and was equivalent to the time his blood and Qi would be boiling, and once the burst of power ended, his battle prowess would drop drastically.

There was nothing else he could do. He had to win this battle.

The Eldest Imperial Prince did not dare to be careless either. Initially, the two of them had been evenly matched, but now that Wang Yu had suddenly exploded, he naturally could no longer hold back.

He also gave a soft exclamation, and instantly, multiple cyan stars appeared around him, as if they had become a universe.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. The Eldest Imperial Prince was an Azure Star Physique, and belonged to the category of Innate Divine Physique. Now, he was finally showing his might.

Just how powerful was the Innate Divine Physique?

He had never seen it before, so he was naturally curious and interested.

“Innate Divine Physique!” Wang Yu humphed, a sliver of wariness in his expression.

The strength of the Innate Divine Physique was not just mere boasting, but had been proven through one battle after another.

The Eldest Imperial Prince rushed over, and the stars that filled the skies shone brilliantly, boosting him with endless power.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The two of them exchanged blows again. After Wang Yu’s burst of power, his battle prowess had almost surpassed Mystery Realm Tier, but the Eldest imperial Prince was even stronger. If there was still a mortal tier above Mystery Realm Tier, then he would definitely be standing on this step.

Which also meant that the present Wang Yu was in between one-star genius and two-star genius, while the Eldest Imperial Prince had reached the height of a two-star genius.

Instantly, the Eldest Imperial Prince gained the upper hand, his whole body radiating with brilliance.

In just a few minutes, Wang Yu was no match, and was sent flying. At this point, the force of outsiders was completely defeated.

The Eldest Imperial Prince withdrew the starlight that filled the skies, and nodded at Ling Han and Princess Bixiao, appearing both poised and noble. -Hehe.” Amidst a light laugh, a middle-aged man walked out. However, the comers of his eyes were covered with wrinkles, as if he had experienced endless hardships.

Hiss, this was a Celestial Path elite!
