Chapter 1708: Which esteemed guest?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Long Gaofei’s face immediately darkened; he actually dared to kick open their main doors?

Didn’t he know that the Lord Holy Son was also here? If the Holy Son was offended, who could bear this responsibility?

“How dare you!!” he shouted harshly.

The elder who entered bore an expression filled with killing intent. He swept an eye over Long Gaofei, and calmly commanded, “Tell that despicable brat, Ling Han, to come out!”

When Long Gaofei heard this, his expression became incredibly strange.

This brat was a little too capable, wasn’t he?

He had already reminded everyone so many times previously that they had to keep a low profile, and not to cause unnecessary trouble. But what did Ling Han do? He had silently become friends with Changsun Liang. This was a good thing, at least, but this man before his eyes was definitely not here to drink tea with Ling Han!

This person... was very strong!

Long Gaofei frowned, and asked, “Second severance?”

The elder showed a hint of pride. “Tong Clan, Tong Jinyun!”

...The Tong Clan had found out the truth from Liu Muyu’s mouth, and they were naturally all enraged. As it turned out, Tong Lin had actually died in such a wronged manner, and had even compelled a fourth severance grand elder to humbly apologize to a Genesis Tier for the sake of this matter.

Even if Changsun Liang was the Holy Son, this was still a disgrace.

For the clan, the Tong Clan’s ancestor had born with it. As the saying went, with a little forbearance, one would find calm and peace. But they had never thought that all this was a trap that someone had set!

Just a minor character from a mere One Star City, and he actually caused the death of a member of the Tong Clan, and even forced the Tong Clan’s ancestor to lower his head in apology. If they did not seek vengeance for this misdeed, how was the Tong Clan going to remain in their circle?

Thus, Tong Jinyun had come.

He was a second severance elite, which was enough to suppress Long Gaofei.

If they sent out anyone too powerful, wasn’t that giving Ling Han too much regard?

“So it is Lord Tong!” Long Gaofei clasped his hands in respect. The fourth severance of Severing Mundane Tier was equivalent to four great mountains. Ascending different peaks would mean possessing completely different status.

Hence, even though the two of them only had a gap of a minor level between them, the actual gap between them was astonishing, whether it was in terms of status or strength.

“Don’t say any more nonsense; tell that despicable brat, Ling Han, to come out!” Tong Jinyun declared darkly. He actually dared trick their Tong Clan; he was really outrageously brazen! Today, no matter what, he would kill Ling Han, and let everyone know that the pride of the Tong Clan could not be impinged upon.

Long Gaofei was filled with confidence. Smiling calmly, he said, “At this time, Ling Han is accompanying an esteemed guest, so I’m afraid that he can’t come out to see you, Milord.”

‘Hmm?’

Tong Jinyun’s eyes involuntarily widened in a glare.

What a joke. As a mere Genesis Tier brat, what esteemed guest could he possibly be receiving? In other words, what esteemed guest would have a more powerful background than him? No wonder he dared to set up a trap to harm their Tong Clan; this brat was indeed arrogant.

No, it was not just that despicable brat that was arrogant; this old geezer was also quite arrogant. Otherwise, how could he have taught such an arrogant junior?

“Are you brushing me off?” Tong Jinyun questioned menacingly. All of a sudden, a heavy pressure weighed down.

This glare was definitely enough to make any Genesis Tier feel weak in the knees, and completely lose all battle prowess, but even if Long Gaofei was no match for the other party, he was still a first severance elite, so he could not possibly be intimidated with just a single look.

He chuckled, and replied, “Of course not! Ling Han is really entertaining an esteemed guest at this moment!”

“Oh, then I really would like to see how esteemed this esteemed guest is!” Tong Jinyun felt his fury blazing. He decided internally that he would thrash that esteemed guest along with Ling Han as well.

What esteemed guest? In his eyes, they were all trash.

He strode out, and Long Gaofei naturally could not manage to stop him. He could only follow behind him.

Peng!

Tong Jinyun did not tell Long Gaofei to point out which room belonged to Ling Han, either, but rather kicked open the doors of each room one after another.

In the first room, Wei Bo looked back expressionlessly.

In the second room, Qin Henyu looked back expressionlessly.

In the third room...

Everyone could hear the conversation that had commenced outside, so they were prepared, and did not lose their heads in a panic. Yet when he kicked open the doors to the sixth room, Ding Xiaochen’s face was filled with resentment. He was too innocent here. He was archenemies with Ling Han, yet because of his connection with Ling Han, he was implicated. He was really too wronged here.

But he was praying secretly in his heart that Tong Jinyun could kill Ling Han with a single palm strike.

There was only one room left. Peng

, the doors to the room were kicked open, revealing the three people that were inside. There were two men and one woman, who were seated, facing each other, and were presently sipping tea, and talking about something.

‘You guys are really quite calm and collected!’

Tong Jinyun humphed coldly, and demanded, “This esteemed guest, turn around and let me have a look.”

Changsun Liang turned around as he asked, and looked at Tong Jinyun expressionlessly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“H-Holy Son!” Tong Jinyun immediately gasped out in shock, his expression varying wildly. It was practically switching from one color to another in quick succession, such that no one could imagine that a human face could actually have so many expressions, and switch expressions at such a rapid pace.

Changsun Liang smiled calmly, and said, “Now that you have seen this Holy Son, what do you want to do?”

Though he was only in Genesis Tier, his status was clear. He was the gem of the Black Moon Sect, bearing the hopes of all the powerful figures of the sect. If he was injured, even if it was a slight scratch on his finger, that would be enough to make the heavens collapse.

...With any Dividing Soul Tier elite moving out, the Tong Clan would instantly be razed to the ground, disappearing in the pages of history.

By now, Tong Jinyun was really filled with bitter regret. How could he have possibly imagined that this esteemed guest would actually be Changsun Liang?

How could a minor character from a One Star City have possibly made a connection with the Holy Son of the Black Moon Sect?

Furthermore, this was Changsun Liang himself who was personally paying a visit to Ling Han, and this was even more inconceivable.

“I did not know the Holy Son was here, and have caused much offense. Please forgive my offense, Holy Son!” Tong Jinyun could only apologize now. If Changsun Liang was really determined to deal with the Tong Clan, even if Tong Clan was a member of the Black Moon Sect, so what?

Changsun Liang calmly said, “If this Holy Son were not here, you would simply barge in without any reservations! Lord Tong, you have to understand this is the territory of the sect, and not the private property of your Tong Clan!”

These words were said harshly, scaring Tong Jinyun so much that he knelt down, no longer caring about any loss of face anymore.

If Changsun Liang wanted to perform an in-depth investigation, it would not be a matter that only involved him, but would rather implicate the entire Tong Clan!

“Please forgive me, Lord Holy Son!”

Changsun Liang did not show any anger or shock, and kept a calm and composed expression, displaying the amount of control that a person in noble standing would have. “Since you were the one who had kicked through the doors of this place, then it would be your responsibility to repair all of them... Lord Tong, are you convinced?”

“Convinced, the Lord Holy Son’s words speak true, I am convinced.” Tong Jinyun hurriedly lowered his head.

Ling Han watched avidly. Should he go and get the label of a Holy Son himself as an intimidation tactic?

“Go on.” Changsun Liang waved him off dismissively.

Tong Jinyun quickly scrambled up from the ground, and obediently went off to repair the doors.

Seeing the old man repairing the doors that he had initially kicked through in an amateurish manner, everyone was gaping and dumbstruck. They felt as if they were about to go blind.

Long Gaofei, meanwhile, was secretly pleased. Little guy, weren’t you very arrogant just now?

Go on and continue being arrogant, idiot!

After repairing 10 doors, Tong Jinyun first apologized to Changsun Liang again, and only then did he leave with his tail between his legs.

Changsun Liang smiled, and said, “Brother Ling, I should also leave. I offer you advance congratulations for obtaining the first place in this competition.”

Though there were still a few days before the competition would begin, the result was practically assured.

He stood up, yet suddenly coughed out, and spat out a mouthful of black blood.
