Chapter 1774: Broken

“What Star Stones?” Ling Han asked casually. An expression of astonishment then spread across his face, and he said, “Perhaps you’re referring to the welcome gift that you gave me just then? Say... Oh, that’s right, what’s your name again?”

He glanced at Zhao Pang, and he didn’t give him an opportunity to speak before waving his hand, and saying, “Forget about it. That’s not important. Say, you’re far too insincere. How can you ask for your welcome gift back?”

‘F*ck your sister!’

Zhao Pang felt so aggrieved that he wanted to cry. Ling Han had taken his Star Stones, and he had also tossed him into the distance and forced him to roll like a ball. Now, he was even saying that he had forgotten his name! How detestable!

He hesitated for a moment before lowering his head and running away. After all, he definitely couldn’t defeat Ling Han. However, could he allow this person with no background whatsoever to bully him, Zhao Pang? Did he truly think that the Zhao Clan was mere decoration?

He would return to gather reinforcements!

Meanwhile, Ling Han couldn’t care less. Regardless of whether he took Zhao Pang’s Star Stones or not, Zhao Pang would definitely continue to target him anyway. Thus, he would simply treat these 10,000 Star Stones as payment for his trouble. He would continue to play this game with the Zhao Clan.

However, Zhao Pang definitely wasn’t the only person who was planning to target him for the spot to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. Moreover, there were definitely more people who wanted to target him because of his lack of background.

Shortly after shooing Zhao Pang away, the servant returned to inform him that another visitor had come.

The visitor was Fu Junyong.

With the surname Fu, he was naturally a member of the Fu Clan. However, there were far too many members in the Fu Clan, and there were more so countless different branches. The branch that Fu Junyong belonged to wasn’t valued much, so they naturally couldn’t receive any spots to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm. As such, Fu Junyong could only rely on Fu Gaoyun.

However, he wasn’t strong enough, so he hadn’t been able to achieve victory and obtain one of the five spots that had been up for grabs. That being the case, he decided to come here to seek Ling Han.

This was obviously because he thought Ling Han would be easy to bully.

“Brother Ling!” Fu Junyong greeted enthusiastically upon entering the hall. He was far more intelligent and sophisticated than Zhao Pang.

After all, one couldn’t strike a smiling person even if they were enraged. Thus, Ling Han smiled, and said, “Brother Junyong!”

Fu Junyong refused to mention the spots to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm, yet he continued to talk about how incredibly dangerous and deadly the mystery realm was. His description was as if Ling Han would most definitely die if he dared to enter.

Ling Han pretended to be astonished, and he asked, “Is it truly so dangerous?”

“Indeed!” Fu Junyong replied. He was delighted upon seeing this, and he immediately seized the opportunity to say, “Brother Ling, how about this. I should be slightly stronger than you, and the clan will also bestow upon me some treasures to protect myself. Why don’t I enter the mystery realm in your stead? Rest assured, regardless of how many treasures I obtain, I’ll give you 90 percent and only keep 10 percent for myself. After all, we’re on such friendly terms.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

‘Holy f*ck! This person is truly blackhearted!

‘At least Zhao Pang still offered me 10,000 Star Stones. No matter what, that was still tangible wealth. However, this dude is trying to take my spot for nothing?

‘Giving me 90 percent and only keeping 10 percent for yourself? Do you think I’ll believe you?

‘At that time, what if you claim that you were extremely unfortunate, and only managed to find two pieces of useless rock? How useful will your promise be then?’

Ling Han immediately rejected this offer, saying, “How can I agree to this? We feel like old friends already, so how can I allow Brother Junyong to risk your life for me? How can I accept the fruits of your hard work for nothing? I definitely can’t agree to this!”

Fu Junyong couldn’t help but look Ling Han up and down. Was he serious or not? If he were serious, then that would make him far too stupid. However, if he were acting, then his expression was far too realistic and convincing.

Thus, he could only say, “Brother Ling, I already said. I’m slightly stronger than you, and I also have the support of the clan. Thus, it’ll definitely be far safer for me to go in your stead!”

“Then that’s even more the reason that I can’t agree!” Ling Han said in righteousness. “What if Brother Junyong gets wounded? What if Brother Junyong accidentally dies? At that time, what will happen to your wife? Won’t she be violated by other men? What about your children? Won’t they have to refer to other men as father? What if they’re maltreated? What if there’s no one to burn incense for you in the future?”

‘Holy f*ck! Your imagination is far too rich and far-fetched! I’m still alive and healthy, so is it really okay for you to curse me like that?’

However, Fu Junyong couldn’t express his anger at this moment. After all, Ling Han was saying this out of care and concern. As such, he could only force himself to swallow these curses.

He couldn’t help but grimace. Ling Han was cursing him to die, yet he still had to thank him for his concern. This caused him to feel incredibly vexed and stifled. He dazedly stared at Ling Han, and he started to ponder whether he had exaggerated the dangers of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm a little too much, so much so that he couldn’t reign his fibs back in.

‘Why is he so stupid? And why is he so incredibly righteous?’

Fu Junyong’s mouth went dry, and he said, “Brother Ling, listen to my advice. Don’t act so rashly.”

Ling Han chuckled, and replied, “If Brother Junyong insists, then it’s not as if I can’t agree.”

‘It’s finally come?’

Delight spread across Fu Junyong’s face, and he said, “Please do continue, Brother Ling. What do you want me to do?”

“Let’s spar with each other. If you’re stronger than me, I’ll naturally let you go in my stead,” Ling Han said. He couldn’t be bothered toying with Fu Junyong anymore.

“Wonderful! No problem!” Fu Junyong replied with an eager nod. He was confident that he could defeat Ling Han with relative ease. After all, Ling Han was far too young. Moreover, he was most likely held in high regard by Fu Gaoyun because of his supreme talent and his incredible potential, not his strength.

The two of them faced off against each other in the courtyard.

“Brother Ling, I’m going to attack now,” Fu Junyong said with a solemn expression. He didn’t want to severely wound Ling Han, as doing so would most likely kill his chances of obtaining the valuable spot.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Then I’ll use my full power.”

“Don’t worry, use your full power. I’ll also control my own power.” Fu Junyong’s expression was as if everything were in his grasp. He made a pressing motion, and a huge number of veined patterns of the great dao instantly materialized before him. Their might was absolutely astounding.

As someone who was highly valued by Fu Gaoyun, he was indeed fairly skilled and talented. Although Fu Junyong had only performed normal severances, he had been extremely close to performing flawless severances. However, no matter how close he had been, his severances were still just normal severances. As such, his battle prowess was naturally far inferior to those who had performed flawless severances.

Ling Han replied with a simple punch. However, he purposefully condensed sweat on his forehead, making it seem as if he were exerting his full strength.

Upon sensing the might of Ling Han’s punch, a hint of disdain involuntarily spread across Fu Junyong’s face. This battle prowess was far too weak! What talent and potential had Fu Gaoyun seen in him? Moreover, he had actually given him a spot to enter the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm!

Ling Han’s fist arrived before him.

Fu Junyong could feel a burst of power rushing over, yet he didn’t think much of it. He was just about to unleash some power to block this strike. However, he suddenly discovered that although this punch was weak, the Regulations contained within it were devastatingly powerful. These were terrifying Regulations that he couldn’t block at all!

Raw power and Regulations were both important aspects of one’s battle prowess. Moreover, starting from the Severing Mundane Tier, Regulations would be the more important aspect. Generally speaking, however, cultivators wouldn’t abandon their cultivation of power. As such, there was still a notion of measuring battle prowess using raw power. The stronger one’s power, the stronger their Regulations.

That being the case, who would have expected Ling Han’s weak-looking punch to contain such overwhelming Regulations?

‘Not good!’ Fu Junyong exclaimed in his mind. However, it was already too late to dodge. The Regulations of the Great Dao surged through his body.

Pu!

He instantly spat a mouthful of blood, and his face also became as white as a sheet.

Ling Han hurriedly dashed over, and asked, “Aiyah! Brother Junyong, are you okay? I’m so sorry, I used too much power. I mistakenly thought that Brother Junyong was much stronger than me. However, who would’ve thought...”

He continued to use his words to slap Fu Junyong’s face. At this moment, Fu Junyong truly wanted to die.

How pitiful he was! He had been pummeled into spitting blood, yet he couldn’t find any reason to explode in rage!

It was he who had said that he would control his power, and it was he who had told Ling Han to use his full power. Thus, he had no option but to swallow this painful result.

This was truly a case of Mr. Wang from next door[1]. Fu Junyong had been completely screwed over!
