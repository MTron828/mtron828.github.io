Chapter 1410 Defenses Breached

At this moment, the Jade Drop Emperor also walked out from the army, his formidable might so powerful that it could subdue his enemies.

Even though they were protected by a large formation, the people in the Imperial Capital were still terrified by his appearance. In fact, even the Heavenly Body Tier elites couldn’t help but start to tremble.

These weren’t two ordinary Heavenly Body Tier elites. Rather, they were two paramount rulers whose utterances were law and whose might was boundless.

“Make haste and open the city gates!” the Jade Drop Emperor commanded menacingly. His voice boomed through the city like thunder.

The nine Heavenly Body Tier elites atop the city wall remained silent and still.

“You refuse?” The Eternity Sky Emperor sneered before waving his hand, and roaring, “Attack!”

Meanwhile, the Jade Drop Emperor also issued an identical command. A row of catapults was instantly rolled out, each measuring at least 300 meters in height and length. These were gigantic catapults, so large that they would instill terror in their enemy’s minds.

These weren’t ordinary catapults, but catapults that had been engraved with formations. Thus, they possessed an unbelievable destructive ability.

However, these catapults were far too large, meaning that they were incredibly difficult to store inside Spatial Spirit Tools. Moreover, they were also incredibly heavy. Thus, they had to be personally crewed by Sun Moon Tier cultivators. Otherwise, no one else would be able to withstand their devastating weight.

The 10 catapults were spread in a line as they were loaded with special projectiles that were forged from Godly metal. These projectiles were spherical and measured almost 30 meters in radius. Their bodies were more so filled with spikes. If a Sun Moon Tier cultivator were unfortunate enough to be struck by such a projectile, they would definitely be killed immediately.

However, the accuracy of these catapults was far too low, and the time needed to load them was also astonishingly long. As such, it was completely unrealistic to use them to attack people. If someone were struck by its projectiles, that would simply be due to horribly bad luck.

These catapults were only useful when laying siege to a city. After all, a city would provide a massive target that these catapults most certainly couldn’t miss. Moreover, it wasn’t as if a city could grow legs and run away. That being the case, any city would become an easy target for these catapults.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The catapults launched their first volley of attacks. Since these were siege weapons, they could naturally cause huge amounts of damage to the large-scale formations that surrounded cities. A projectile landed on the barrier formed by the formation, instantly causing it to shudder.

The elites in the Imperial Capital hurriedly channeled their Origin Power into the formation, providing it with power to stabilize.

Because they had pulled their troops back, the Sun Moon Tier cultivators in the nearby cities had almost all come to the Imperial Capital. Thus, the Imperial Capital was brimming with powerful cultivators at this moment, with tens of thousands of Sun Moon Tier cultivators. As such, it was naturally an easy task to maintain the circulation of the city protection formation. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Each battalion consisted of 1000 people, and these battalions would take turns in providing power for the city protection formation. It would almost be impossible for the formation to run out of power. Of course, this was if the situation remained unchanging.

However, this was only the beginning.

The catapults continued to launch volley after volley of attacks, and a wave of enemy soldiers also started to charge at the Imperial Capital. Once the city protection formation was stretched beyond its limits, it would naturally crumble and disappear.

The enemy strategy was to breach the formation through the use of brute strength. It didn’t matter that they had no understanding of the formation. As long as they were powerful enough, what would it matter how mighty the formation was? They would simply destroy it with brute strength.

The people in the Imperial Capital naturally wouldn’t sit by idly and watch the enemies attack. They immediately retrieved the city defense weapons, firing at their enemies with powerful bows and crossbows. Large swathes of enemies were instantly wounded and killed.

Guarding a city was easy, and attacking a city was hard. This was common sense. However, because cultivators were far too powerful, it was possible that the existence of a paramount being would mean that a city could be defeated with a wave of their hand.

In any case, this was a war of attrition, where the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire was doing everything it could to defend, while the two other Majestic Empires were doing everything they could to attack. The number of elites possessed by the two Majestic Empires was astounding.

“So many elites,” Ling Han remarked as he swept his gaze over the battlefield. Although he was sitting far away, he could still see a large number of elites in the distance. Apart from the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor, there were still three other elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. As they blinked, it was as if the sun were rising from the horizon. This was a dazzling sight.

“Can they defend the Imperial Capital? How long can they defend?” Ling Han murmured.

The two Majestic Empires had deployed all of their troops for this assault, and it was most likely that they were certain of their victory. To think that this one city could stop them in their tracks would be to underestimate their power.

The most important question was, how long would they need to breach this city?

If they were unable to seize the Imperial Capital before Empress Luan Xing exited seclusion, they would definitely lose this war. On the other hand, if they seized the Imperial Capital before Empress Luan Xing exited seclusion... the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would cease to exist!

However, who could say when Empress Luan Xing would exit seclusion? If they had a definitive date, they would at least have a goal to work toward. Right now, however, it was as if they were fighting a battle that didn’t have an end in sight. Such battles could easily drain one of their will and confidence. After all, they were facing off against the elites of two Majestic Empires!

Boom!

Deafening rumbles continued to sound throughout the city as the catapults relentlessly fired volley after volley of projectiles. Meanwhile, the two Majestic Empires were uncaring about their casualties as they attacked day and night, pouring huge numbers of soldiers into attacking the city. They showed great determination and will to seize this city.

On the third day, even Heavenly Body Tier elites started to participate in the assaults. They stood proudly in the air, extracting the power of heavenly bodies as they unleashed a barrage of powerful attacks.

This was utterly terrifying.

During battles, who dared to spend several seconds preparing a powerful attack? To say nothing of several seconds, one might be killed even if they hesitated for a split-second. Right now, however, no one could stop these Heavenly Body Tier elites from wantonly preparing their attacks.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Heavenly Body Tier elites could resonate with heavenly bodies and thus extract boundless power from them. Countless flaming meteors materialized in the air, hurtling toward the city like a rain of fire. These meteors should have blotted out the sun and created darkness, yet because they were flaming, they instead caused the surroundings to radiate with dazzling light.

The citizens of Point Star City were all numb with fear. Those who were more easily frightened had already collapsed to the ground in fright, unable to pick themselves back up. In fact, even Qu Qiuxue and the other Heavenly Body Tier elites wore grave expressions, cold sweat dripping down their backs.

Could the city protection formation... truly block these attacks?

The meteors crashed down, and the formation shuddered precariously. A violent ripple traveled over the formation as if it were made out of water.

“Move aside!”

The nine Heavenly Body Tier elites hurriedly ejected the cultivators who were currently controlling the formation, sending them flying into the surroundings. They then personally took control of the formation, providing it with endless power and finally returning it to stability.

However, this still wasn’t enough.

The two Majestic Empires had close to 100 Heavenly Body Tier elites, while they were only a team of nine Heavenly Body Tier elites. Their enemies could rotate shifts and rest, while they had to maintain the city protection form as long as the battle lasted. This could be one year, five years, or 10 years... There would eventually come a day when they ran out of power.

“We have to take shifts.”

The nine Heavenly Body Tier elites controlled the formation in shifts, with each person controlling it for one day at a time. Along with some Sun Moon Tier cultivators to support them, they could just barely manage to keep the formation running.

The situation was finally stabilized.

Ling Han’s worries were also slightly eased, and he sat back down on the mountain in the distance.

However, after just five days, the situation took a dramatic turn for the worse.

The formation surrounding Point Star City... suddenly disappeared!

It hadn’t been blasted apart, but had instead disappeared by itself. It was as if... someone in the city had purposefully shut down the formation.

What in the world was going on? Was someone seeking death?

“What’s going on?”

“Why was the formation suddenly shut down?”

“Heavens! What are we going to do now?”

Chaos ripped through the city following the sudden shutdown of the city protection formation. Without the city protection formation, how were they going to defend against the assault of the two Majestic Empires?

‘We’re done for! We’re done for!’

The Eternity Sky Emperor laughed heartily, and commanded, “Haha, all troops, attack! Seize this city!” He drew his sword and pointed at the city before him.

Ling Han’s brows creased into a deep frown. It completely baffled him as to why the city protection formation had suddenly shut down. However, there was no hesitation in his movements as he immediately leaped up and charged toward Point Star City.
