Chapter 1937: Who exactly are you?

Mo Shuang immediately withdrew. He took a few steps back, drawing out the distance between himself and Ling Han. Only then did he turn towards the group of seven, showing an expression of humiliation and anger, and declared, “Han Tao, there is no need for you to poke your nose in!”

He was talking to the man that was shouldering a large bow.

Han Tao laughed loudly. As his eyes swept over Ling Han’s group, a stunned expression immediately appeared on his face. The beauty of the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou could be considered without match in this world, yet three of them just happened to appear at the same time.

Though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was slightly inferior, she could still be considered an exquisite beauty, and even in Guanhua City, there were not many who could compare to her.

“Don’t you, Seventh Young Master Mo, consider yourself important, and think that you are the most powerful prodigy besides Holy Son Liu? Why have you been fighting for so long, and still couldn’t even touch a corner of your opponent’s robes?” a youth in green asked with a laugh, the hint of ridicule about the corners of his lips extremely apparent.

His name was Lu Haoming, and he could be considered a foe of Mo Shuang. That was because both of them were courting the same woman, and that was the young girl in red who was also a member of this group of seven. She was called Fairy Du, and her name was Du Xiuyun.

With such a good opportunity in front of him, there was naturally no reason for him to miss out on it.

“Lu Haoming, do you want to die?” Mo Shuang’s temper was flaring, and hearing the mocking ridicule from Lu Haoming, he couldn’t help but become even more displeased.

“Oh, if you have not reached the seventh level in your Heaven Peck Technique, you are completely unworthy to become my opponent!” Lu Haoming declared proudly.

Mo Shuang’s gaze became serious. “You have reached ‘Breakthrough’ in your Great Evolution Technique?”

“Hehe.” Lu Haoming appeared to be even more arrogant.

In truth, he had finally pushed the Great Evolution Technique to the level of Breakthrough just a few days ago, but seeking out Mo Shuang directly for a challenge would seem too deliberate, and this presently was the best chance for him.

To harshly humiliate Mo Shuang in front of Du Xiuyun.

Mo Shuang wanted to say some fierce words, but after being hostile with Lu Haoming for so long, the two of them could be considered very knowledgeable about each other. Only if his Heaven Peck Technique had reached the seventh level would he be capable of matching the other’s Breakthrough.

If he went off to battle the other just for the sake of his pride, it was certain that he would be embarrassed, and the humiliation of that far surpassed that of refusing to battle.

Now that Lu Haoming had the upper hand, he couldn’t help but laugh loudly. He said, “Brother Mo, let me help you deal with this opponent!”

This could be considered further humiliation. ‘Since you couldn’t handle him, and I can, it naturally means that you are inferior.’

Ling Han was just watching the proceedings when he suddenly saw that he was pulled abruptly into the fray. He was going to turn from a spectator to one of the leads, which made him slightly surprised.

Just now, he... hadn’t said anything, right?

“Husband indeed is the type to attract trouble. No matter what, you would still attract animosity,” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said with a tone of certainty.

“Ling Han, beat them up!” Meanwhile, Hu Niu called out in excitement.

Ling Han stroked his chin, and asked, “What did I do to you? Did I accidentally leak out how you come and go from the brothel, or was it the matter of your fondness for men?”

Judging from the look of things, this battle would be inevitable, and he did not bother to advise the other party to stop before he sought his own suffering.

Since he was so determined to ask for a beating, what could be done?

Han Tao and the others immediately burst into laughter. The two women covered their mouths, appearing to be embarrassed, but judging from their eyes, it was clear that this kind of joke was completely incapable of causing them to be embarrassed.

Lu Haoming meanwhile was furious. He looked at Ling Han menacingly, and said, “At first, I had only planned to play around with you, but you just had to blurt out nonsense. Looks like if I don’t give you a beating, you won’t learn to become obedient.”

Ling Han shook his head, and replied, “I don’t want to play with you, you pervert that likes men!”

Lu Haoming was so furious that his hands were shaking. How could this guy have such a venomous tongue?

“You just have to ask for your own suffering!” He moved, and boom, a rainbow surged out of his body, turning into a massive scythe that sliced out towards Ling Han. There were seven seals of great dao flickering on the blade, and they were all incredibly mysterious.

Abruptly, Mo Shuang’s expression became grim. Seven seals of great dao were the symbol of someone who had reached Breakthrough in the Great Evolution Technique.

Though those seven seals were not complete, their number was still a solid threat. Among fourth severance emperor tiers, this could already be ranked into the top tier, and further upwards... only monarch tiers could suppress him.

He had to work hard and put more effort in, or he would really be stepped on by Lu Haoming.

Ling Han extended a finger, tapping out towards Lu Haoming.

...Facing Mo Shuang, for the sake of his third senior brother, Ling Han had been easy on him. After all, he was a senior. But against Lu Haoming, there was no need for that. He just had to move directly.

Weng, he flicked out a finger, and a frightening aura immediately pressed down like the heavens crashing down. Everything else had disappeared, and the only thing left was that finger of Ling Han that was streaking through the air in attack. It was clearly just in front of his eyes, yet exuded a pressure that seemed to traverse all ages.

Ling Han had embedded a sliver of the Regulations of Time in this tap.

It was not Tide of the Ages, but what he had comprehended from the Black Tower.

Immediately, Lu Haoming’s expression changed greatly. Though they had not actually clashed yet, he had a feeling that this tap... was something he could not take head-on.

How could that be? The other was only a fourth severance too.

Pu!

He felt a suffocating feeling in his heart, and spluttered out a mouthful of blood.

Seeing this scene, everyone could feel their heads go numb with shock. It should be known that Ling Han’s attack had not even made contact yet. It had just been the gust of wind that had come with the attack, and yet Lu Haoming already could not withstand it. Th-th-this... the gap in power was really too wide.

This was not a battle of fourth severance against fourth severance, it clearly was a Dividing Soul Tier crushing a Severing Mundane Tier!

Pa, Lu Haoming collapsed onto the ground, and could only watch helplessly the incoming offensive of this tap. Boundless sweat surged all over his body, instantly dampening his clothing.

However, this finger stopped right in front of Lu Haoming’s forehead, and was just a slight bit away from making actual contact.

Fifth severance!

Mo Shuang and the others were all mouthing these words soundlessly, their faces covered with astonishment.

Even in the Wide Prosperity Heaven, there were pitifully few fifth severance monarch tiers. That really was the highest-grade prodigy of the entire Celestial Realm, capable of garnering extreme envy from countless king tiers and emperor tiers.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “Is this fun?”

Lu Haoming could not speak at all. He was already completely dumbfounded with shock. After a long while, he finally recovered some of his composure, and an involuntary hatred rose up in him against Ling Han. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

How could he not hate Ling Han?

You were so strong, being completely capable of easily defeating Mo Shuang, so why had you put on a pretense of being more or less his equal, causing Lu Haoming to be fooled and underestimate his opponent? The latter made his move, and the result was that he had experienced a major embarrassment.

...Someone like Lu Haoming would definitely not do any kind of self-reflection. It was clearly he who had made the first move to provoke and attack Ling Han, but he actually thought that it was Ling Han who had deliberately pretended to be weak, tempting him to make a move. This really was the guilty party filing the suit.

Mo Shuang was also stunned. He naturally knew Lu Haoming’s strength very well, and the latter was actually no match for Ling Han at all. Then, it had to be the same case for him too, but previously, Ling Han had actually gone easy on him for so many moves. Now that he thought about him, this was really giving him face.

This was how humans were. Before finding out about Ling Han’s true strength, Mo Shuang thought that Ling Han could be pushed around as he liked, but now that he had discovered how strong Ling Han was, he was instead grateful towards Ling Han.

Who exactly was this?

After he had dispensed with his arrogance, Mo Shuang immediately recovered the intelligence that was befitting of a prodigy.

Though Peng Huanian was very contemptuous towards Ling Han, upon deeper thought, the former must have come with Ling Han.

Someone who was worthy of being personally escorted by a Three-Star Alchemist—what did that mean?

Ling Han definitely was not the person that Peng Huanian had vaguely described—just a nameless nobody from the Calm Peace Heaven. On the other hand, he had to have come from a very prestigious background.

Immediately, realization dawned on Mo Shuang. Peng Huanian had actually used him as a tool. Because he was not in the position to make a move on Ling Han, he had pushed him out, almost causing him to fall into a terrible defeat and resulting in humiliation.

As he thought about it, he was filled with gratitude towards Ling Han, but felt a rising anger towards Peng Huanian.

“Brother Ling, who exactly are you?” he asked.
