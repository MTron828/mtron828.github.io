Chapter 1971: Ji Wuming

“Battle!”

With a low roar, Ling Han immediately charged forward. He had already recovered some of his battle prowess, and his defenses were more so invincible. Thus, he didn’t need to worry about his safety even though he wasn’t in his peak state.

Under his lead, Yan Xianlu and the others also charged forward.

They had already endured their anger for a very long time. At this moment, they were finally unleashing it all.

Shu Yarong sighed upon seeing this. With a flash, she arrived before Ling Han. She then reached over with a palm and blocked him, saying, “Brother Ling, please restrain yourself and consider the bigger picture.”

“The bigger picture?” Ling Han said with a cold chuckle. “You’re telling me to consider the bigger picture now? When those people were trying to shoo me away just then, where did your bigger picture disappear to? When they were trying to snatch my weapon, where did your bigger picture disappear to?

“Say, does your so-called bigger picture only exist when your side isn’t enjoying the advantage?

“Bigger picture your mom! Come, battle!”

Right now, Ling Han’s temper definitely wasn’t good. The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven had treated him with contempt first, and now they were even trying to screw him over. It would be a miracle if he could endure this.

He lashed out in anger, and Hu Niu also roared as she unleashed her full battle prowess. A Roc materialized in the air, screeching as it beat its wings and released its devastating aura. The Empress was no weaker, and she summoned all nine of her doppelgangers. They were all monarch tiers, and they all unleashed their own celestial techniques.

The three of them made up the main force of the Calm Peace Heaven. Meanwhile, Yan Xianlu, Shan Jitong, Lao Song, and the others acted as supports. They unleashed some kind of formation, and their battle prowess wasn’t weak, either.

With a long roar, Ye Linfeng led the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven to engage in a ferocious counterattack. The two sides became locked in an intense battle.

This was a fight between two heavens, so it was naturally as intense as could be. Both sides detested each other.

Contrary to Celestial medicines which could only be obtained by a single person, the true meaning of the great dao could be shared and comprehended by everyone. However, the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven didn’t want to share this with the prodigies from the Calm Peace Heaven, and the reverse was also true.

The battle became increasingly heated.

Even though Shu Yarong tried her best to dissuade everyone, the best she could do was only to prevent deaths on either side. After all, she was only at the fifth severance.

In terms of the number of monarch tiers, the Calm Peace Heaven was naturally at a disadvantage. They only had a total of six monarch tiers. Meanwhile, the Wide Prosperity Heaven had a total of 11 monarch tiers. However, Ling Han, Hu Niu, and the Empress were far too powerful. They stabilized the situation, and they allowed the Calm Peace Heaven to have a chance at victory.

“Celestial Maiden Shu, stop hesitating! Dispose of those trash!” the emperor tiers from the Wide Prosperity Heaven shouted. Without the formations of monarch tiers, they didn’t have the right to participate in this kind of battle.

It was during the Severing Mundane Tier that they were the most inferior to monarch tiers. After advancing to the Dividing Soul Tier, they could most likely hold their own.

Shu Yarong was still struck with indecision. It was clear that neither side was willing to back down. It was impossible for them to cooperate again. That being the case, it was better for her to act decisively and defeat the prodigies from the Calm Peace Heaven. Otherwise, continuing on like this wouldn’t lead to any result.

“Haha, is this picking on the outnumbered?” someone said with a loud laugh. A figure suddenly dashed over.

Xiu!

With a wave of his hand, he released an indescribably fast arrow at a monarch tier from the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

This monarch tier was currently being suppressed by Hu Niu, and he seemed to be in a desperate situation. Upon seeing the nearing arrow, he couldn’t help but roar and form a celestial seal with his hands. He then grabbed at the arrow.

Pa!

He caught the arrow, yet the arrow was far too quick. There was a flash of red as blood spurted from his hand. The arrow then slid through his hand and directly pierced his chest.

The monarch tier humphed as he frantically shot back in retreat. However, the arrow had already pierced halfway through his chest.

Fortunately, he had grabbed the arrow for a brief moment, and blocked most of its power. Otherwise, the might of this arrow would have been even greater.

He instantly became pale, and his aura started to plummet.

The person who had launched the sneak attack was none other than Ji Wuming!

The bow in his hands was a genuine Celestial Tool. Even though its power was limited by his cultivation level, the might of the arrow was still utterly terrifying.

Ji Wuming flashed a smile. This was an indescribably sinister and baleful smile. With a flash, he had already appeared behind the wounded monarch tier.

“You dare?!” Without even turning around, the monarch tier immediately launched a palm strike.

He was a monarch tier, so even though he was wounded, and even though his battle prowess had fallen drastically, his attacks were still brimming with destructive power.

Ji Wuming opened his mouth, and a stunning scene ensued. Like a colossal Taotie[1], his mouth actually widened to an unbelievable size. With a gulp, he then swallowed the monarch tier!

The monarch tier had been swallowed whole!

This... A cold chill shot down everyone’s spine. This was far too harrowing. That was a mighty monarch tier! Yet, he had been swallowed just like that!

Not to mention whether eating people was moral or not, could Ji Wuming even digest this monarch tier?

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Numerous fist imprints started to appear on Ji Wuming’s abdomen. It was clear that the monarch tier was unleashing his fury inside Ji Wuming’s stomach. However, Ji Wuming’s stomach possessed terrifying toughness and elasticity, and it wouldn’t break no matter what.

A smile spread across Ji Wuming’s face as he patted his stomach. He then looked toward the others.

Wherever he looked, those under his gaze couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of apprehension. They felt like Ji Wuming wasn’t a person at all. Instead, he was a petrifying monster.

“Ji Wuming!” Shu Yarong roared in anger. She brandished her sword and charged at Ji Wuming.

He actually dared to attack members of the Wide Prosperity Heaven before her? Moreover, he attacked a monarch tier with limitless potential, a monarch tier who could definitely become a Celestial King! This caused her to become wild with fury.

Shua!

Her sword slashed down.

Ji Wuming simply lifted the bow in his hand to parry. The bow rapidly expanded in size, growing from a foot long to five feet long.

Clang!

He blocked the strike from Shu Yarong.

“Why so angry?” he asked in a calm voice.

Shu Yarong became even more enraged.

Boom!

Flames erupted from her silken hair, and her entire body became a raging fireball. She appeared even more dazzling and radiant. With a whoosh, she launched another sword strike at Ji Wuming.

However, Ji Wuming simply shook his head, and said, “My battle with Tang Minglong already wasted too much time. I don’t want to waste any more time on you!” With a flash, he escaped from Shu Yarong at an incredible speed. He then grabbed at an emperor tier.

The emperor tier roared in anger as he counterattacked with his full strength.

However, with a simple gulp, Ji Wuming swallowed this emperor tier into his stomach.

To say nothing of others, even Ling Han couldn’t help but shed some cold sweat upon seeing this. This person was far too heartless and fearless. He even swallowed living people whole. Of course, he understood that Ji Wuming definitely wasn’t swallowing people to satisfy his appetite. Instead, he was doing so to increase his strength or physique.

Hu Niu crossed her arms, and said, “Disgusting!” There was an expression of disgust on her face.

Even though she was a glutton, she had never had any interest in eating humans.

“Ji Wuming, I’m going to kill you!” Shu Yarong roared as she chased after him.

“You already said that once, and I heard you loud and clear. No need to shout it again. You’re almost about to burst my eardrums,” Ji Wuming said as he picked at his ears. He dashed away again, avoiding any conflict with Shu Yarong. At the same time, he continued to target other prodigies.

His bow was far too powerful, and taking advantage of the conflict between the Wide Prosperity Heaven and the Calm Peace Heaven, he continued to target prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven. Moreover, he wouldn’t need to launch sneak attacks on emperor tiers at all. He could directly charge over and swallow them.

At this moment, the prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven fell into complete disarray. They lost all intent to battle.

Meanwhile, the prodigies from the Calm Peace Heaven were brimming with battle intent. Even though Ji Wuming’s action of swallowing people was terrifying, was he not helping them right now?

They would seize this opportunity to attack.

Only a single person had joined the battle, yet he managed to turn the entire situation on its head. The prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven fled in complete disarray. At this moment, they didn’t have the time nor effort to care about the true meaning of the great dao. After all, if they lost their lives, what use was a treasure? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ji Wuming suddenly turned to the prodigies of the Calm Peace Heaven, and said, “Hehe, it’s your turn now!” There was a dangerous glint in his eyes.

With a smack, he instantly swallowed an emperor tier from the Calm Peace Heaven. His eyes were gleaming, and he appeared much like a primordial beast.
