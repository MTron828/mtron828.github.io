3128 Pursuit

Li Changdan and the other two were also very surprised. They had launched a sneak attack, had an advantage in numbers, and also had the advantage of cultivation level, yet they were still unable to kill Ling Han?

What kind of luck did this kid have?

“You’re really lucky!” Rui Yuanliang said balefully.

“Don’t waste your breath on him. Kill him!” Yang Fei’s eyes shot out a cold light. He really hated Ling Han to death. Ling Han had caused him to show his buttocks in public, making him not even dare to show his face in public.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You guys really have schemed seriously. You actually followed me all the way here.”

“Ling Han, today will be the day you die. This place will be the place where your bones are buried!” Rui Yuanliang laughed coldly, and took the lead to launch an attack. He brandished a large saber that shone with a cold light in his hand, and slashed it towards Ling Han’s neck.

The power of his Eight Meridians surged, and his battle prowess wasn’t weak at all.

Yang Fei also brandished his sword, slashing towards Ling Han.

Li Changdan didn’t make a move. He was like a sinister viper, looking for the best opportunity to strike.

His caution was reasonable. Otherwise, Ling Han would have directly taken out that Talisman Weapon. With the power of the Ten Meridians erupting, so what if the three of them joined forces? Perhaps they would be instantly killed.

Ling Han also took out his longsword. Ding, ding, ding, ding, he continuously clashed with Rui Yuanliang and Yang Fei.

His current strength was not much weaker than Rui Yuanliang’s. Compared to Yang Fei, he was actually more superior. Thus, he was not at a disadvantage in a one-on-two battle.

However, he wasn’t in the Ten Meridians yet, so he couldn’t release his power, and he couldn’t attack at close range when wielding a sharp weapon. Thus, he couldn’t unleash the power of the Demonic Monkey Fists. Otherwise, with the support of his left hand using the Demonic Monkey Fists, his battle prowess would naturally be even stronger.

Even so, this was shocking enough.

During the selection, Ling Han had relied on the suppression of the ancient formation to defeat Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang, but now?

Without the slightest bit of cultivation level suppression, he was still only at a slight disadvantage in a one-versus-two confrontation. He was simply freakish.

Li Changdan’s expression turned ugly. Although it was easy to cultivate at a lower cultivation level, he was not like Ling Han, who had only used a few short months to reach a height that others could only reach in a few years. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was hesitating whether he should make a move.

“Senior Brother Li, what are you hesitating for?” Yang Fei shouted. “Let’s attack together and kill this guy!”

“Li Changdan, this was your idea. Why are you hesitating now that things have come to this?” Rui Yuanliang also said. If they did not have Li Changdan’s powerful suppression, it would be impossible for him and Yang Fei to kill Ling Han.

If he couldn’t win, wouldn’t he run?

Li Changdan was different from these two. He had almost become the Dao Child, so he naturally had a better understanding of martial arts.

…Sun Jianfang had many rare treasures in his possession. This time, he had sent Ling Han out alone. Would he not bestow one or two to him so he could protect himself?

In any case, Li Changdan didn’t believe that Ling Han had not been given anything.

Thus, he was worried that if he couldn’t kill Ling Han, then allowing Ling Han to take out a rare treasure, it would have unfathomable consequences.

Putting everything else aside, as long as Ling Han could escape to the sect, then Li Changdan would be charged with murdering the Dao Child, and would definitely die.

Thus, today he would either have to kill Ling Han, or he would have to escape from the sect and wander the world.

He had no choice. He had to take a gamble. Otherwise, the glory that belonged to him would never return.

“Alright!” Li Changdan nodded, but took a few steps back. He picked up a palm-sized rock from the ground, and threw it at Ling Han.

Force couldn’t be released, but power could be thrown out through a “weapon.”

Xiu, the power of a peak Nine Meridians cultivator was as high as 15000 kg. In addition, Li Changdan was stronger than an ordinary Nine Meridians cultivator. This power reached 17500 kilograms. How terrifying would the destructive power be when enveloped around a rock that was thrown out?

Even if it couldn’t be perfectly unleashed, it was still more than 10,000 kilograms.

This power far exceeded Ling Han’s limits. If he was hit by it, Ling Han would definitely be sent flying.

Ling Han dodged to the side, dodging the stone’s attack. However, in order to dodge this attack, he was also almost struck by Rui Yuanliang’s large saber, and broke out in a cold sweat.

How could it be a joke when a Nine Meridians attacked?

Although Rui Yuanliang and Yang Fei were very dissatisfied with Li Changdan’s actions, the latter still seriously affected Ling Han, after all. Thus, they didn’t say anything else.

As long as they could kill Ling Han, it would be fine. Even if it took a longer time, so be it.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, Li Changdan continuously threw rocks. He was abnormally accurate, forcing Ling Han to divert a large portion of his attention to cope with it. Furthermore, Ling Han had to dodge, and could not use his weapon to meet the attack. The difference in power was too great, and it was possible that a single strike would cause his longsword to slip from his hand.

However, this way, Rui Yuanliang’s power suddenly increased, and even Yang Fei’s attack became something that couldn’t be ignored.

This was not going anywhere.

Ling Han frowned slightly. Could it be that he had to immediately use that Talisman Weapon?

The problem was that the Talisman Weapon couldn’t be channeled for a long time. Right now, Li Changdan was just throwing stones at the periphery. It would be too easy for him to escape. At that time, he only needed to wait for the Talisman Weapon to run out of energy, and he would be able to charge his way back.

At that time, there would really be no way out for Ling Han.

Xiu, another rock smashed over with a whistling wind. This one was so fast that it was already close to the speed of sound, emitting a sonic boom. As it passed, the sound compressed and materialized.

‘Go!’

Ling Han let out a long cry, and suddenly charged out of the battle, exerting all his strength to run.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang chased after him. Although Li Changdan also started to chase after him, he still maintained a distance.

Xiu, a rock smashed over, catching up to Ling Han at subsonic speeds, directly striking his back.

Ling Han dodged to the side, avoiding this attack. However, because of this delay, Yang Fei and Rui Yuanliang had already caught up to him and launched a fierce attack.

‘F*ck.’

Ling Han cursed in his heart, but there was nothing he could do. A Nine Meridians was too powerful. Just Li Changdan alone was more than what he could match. This result was very normal.

It couldn’t be helped. He hadn’t been able to learn the Ancient Formation. Otherwise, if he set up a large formation now and pulled everyone’s cultivation level to the same level, so what if the three of them joined forces?

Ling Han continued to run. If they were to start a battle in such an open area, the threat of Li Changdan’s stone-throwing attack would be too great. Moreover, this place was like a natural armory, and there were stones everywhere. There was no need to worry that there would be no stones to use.

Soon, a pitch-black cave appeared in front of Ling Han, exuding a sinister aura, as if he would never be able to come out after entering.

This was the entrance to the Jade Dragon Mine.

Ling Han gritted his teeth, and sprinted into the cave.

If they were in the mine, the power of Li Changdan’s stone throwing would be severely limited. Not to mention anything else, the light was so dim. How could his aim be so accurate?

“Stop him!” Li Changdan shouted.

However, Rui Yuanliang’s and Yang Fei’s speed was not higher than Ling Han’s. How could they stop them?

Li Changdan was begrudging, and could only unleash his power. Peng, his speed instantly soared to the extreme, and layers of sound barriers appeared behind him, rapidly closing the distance between him and Ling Han.

Ling Han chuckled, and took out the Talisman Weapon.

Li Changdan immediately stopped.
