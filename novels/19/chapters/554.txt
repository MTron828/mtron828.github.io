Chapter 555: Battling Xuanyuan Zi Guang

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“The Fourth Killing Formation?” Zhu Xuan Er asked in astonishment.

“According to the legends, there are spirits in heaven and earth that form ten natural killing formations,” Ling explained. “The ten killing formations are all extremely terrifying. The Second Killing Formation to the Tenth Killing Formation can even wipe out Shattering Void Tiers.”

“Then what about the First Killing Formation?” Zhu Xuan Er couldn’t help but ask.

“The First Killing Formation...?” Ling Han paused. “It’s also known as God Killing Formation!”

“Could it really kill gods?” Zhu Xuan Er cried out.

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded. “The First Killing Formation can erase even gods—the world’s greatest killing formation. However, knowledge of formations was lost, so who could set up such a killing formation now?”

The Fourth Killing Formation could even wipe out high-level Shattering Void Tier elites, yet someone could actually set it up at this day and age. Not to mention whether such a grand formation master existed, the materials used to set up the formation alone were something extremely extravagant.

“Then aren’t we in extreme danger?” Zhu Xuan Er said.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “No idea which force actually trapped Million Treasures City with the Fourth Killing Formation. Are they trying to turn the entire city into a land of the dead? But, Million Treasures City is middle state’s financial center; its value consists in Spirit Treasures Pavilion and the Alchemist Society. If everyone dies, how would it benefit them?”

If it were to take over a favorable location, that would be understandable, but Million Treasures City wasn’t some holy land for cultivation and had no worldy treasures; was it really necessary to unleash the Fourth Killing Formation? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Truly strange.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “We can’t possibly break through this formation, and even if a Shattering Void Tier elite came, they’d have to be at least in the ninth layer to qualify to break past it; otherwise, even if a dozen came, they’d still fail.”

Zhu Xuan Er obviously agreed. How many Shattering Void Tier cultivators were there in the vast lands? No one knew, but at most several dozen. Even if all of them came, they might not even be able to resolve this formation.

They retreated slowly for fear that the formation would react, killing them on spot.

Fortunately, the Fourth Killing Formation which could kill Shattering Void Tier elites didn’t seem to care much about nobodies like them. The formation was stagnant and had no reaction. On the other hand, it was also because they didn’t go deep. The killing formation was a killing formation, after all, and wouldn’t miss a small fish because its net was big.

They retreated out of the formation, and Million Treasures City appeared before them. In reality, this was the entire killing formation’s core, but since Spirit Treasure Pavilion also activated a formation to resist, this became a relatively safe area.

“Han Lin!” With a sneer, an imposing and domineering figure appeared before them.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

He stared at Ling Han, and his killing intent circulated. This wasn’t in front of the Spirit Treasures Pavilion, and was even outside of Milion Treasures City; no one could stop him from murder here.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “You guys go into the city first. I’ll take on this guy.”

“Be careful!”

Zhu Xuan Er was kind and caring...

“Beat him up!”

...While Hu Niu waved her small fists.

“Beat him!” Helian Xunxue was now leaning towards Hu Niu because she obviously wouldn’t trust Zhu Xuan Er after Liu Yu Tong and Li Si Chan’s brainwashing, leaving her only mimicking Hu Niu.

Two grown-ups and a child returned to the city, while Ling Han and Xuanyuan Zi Guang faced off.

Ling Han didn’t dare to take things lightly. Battling at the same tier, he had the confidence not to lose to anyone. However, Xuanyuan Zi Guang was not only much higher in tier, he also had superb battle prowess; in reality, Ling Han was in a disadvantageous position.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang cut the superfluous words and attacked with a palm from afar. Hong , a sea of fire spread out, spiraling fiercely towards Ling Han.

Ling Han carried out Demon Fairy Step, charging towards his opponent. There was too great of a difference in tier between him and his opponent, and it would be too stupid of him to fire against each other at a distance. In battle, one obviously should play to one’s forte. To greet an opponent with one’s weakness would be too unwise.

“Hmph, dream on!” Xuanyuan Zi Guang snorted. He also carried out a movement art and pulled apart the distance between them while unleashing powerful attacks, taking the absolute initiative.

His martial arts talent truly wasn’t below that of Ling Han, and even surpassed it in certain aspects. At least, 22 flashes of Qi were currently number one amongst the younger generation, and under the amplification of heaven and earth’s Spirit Qi, it was as if there were 23 of him attacking Ling Han together—truly shocking.

Ling Han responded with ease. He also had many trump cards, such as the Demon Birth Sword, the Thunder Battle Armor, and the Iron Sheet Body, and which of those couldn’t turn the tables? He also laughed coldly, and said, “Since you don’t dare to fight in close-quarters combat, then have a taste of this!”

His figure retreated continuously, and instantly pulled 10 meters away from Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

Earlier, he kept trying to close the distance between them, thus this sudden retreat was out of Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s expectations, making him stop momentarily and not counterattack immediately in fear that it might be a trap. Xuanyuan Zi Guang moved forward, while Ling Han also leapt backwards.

“Hmph, my cultivation is higher than yours and my Origin Power is denser, pulling apart the gap; you’re even less of an opponent,” Xuanyuan Zi Guang said loftily, firing out a palm attack as 23 fire lions appeared and pounced at Ling Han.

It was only 10 meters; it was impossible for Origin Power to be exhausted at such a small distance.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You think too highly of yourself!” He gestured as if drawing a bow, and instantly, a spec of light surfaced, turning into the shape of an arrow. With a xiu , it shot towards Xuanyuan Zi Guang.

Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow.

Fast as a ray of light!

Xuanyuan Zi Guang was shocked, hurriedly summoning Origin Power in defense. Pa , the arrow shot at his chest, but the Origin Power shield appeared in time, blocking the arrow. Even so, it still made him groan; it was so painful that he almost hacked a mouthful of blood.

In terms of power, he was obviously above Ling Han, but Ling Han focused power on one point, while he had to guard his entire body; this was obviously incomparable.

It couldn’t be helped; the arrow was too fast, and he didn’t know what part of him it would aim at, forcing him to guard all over.

Ling Han retreated with ease, escaping from the 23 fire tigers, and said, “You’re nothing more than this!”

Xuanyuan Zi Guang made a very sullen face. No matter tier or battle prowess, he should firmly suppress Ling Han, yet he suffered a small loss, damaging his self-esteem.

A godlike man like him... He was always the only one who, at a lower tier, won against other geniuses. How could he be beaten by someone at a lower tier?

He was furious. A flame arose above his head and turned into a dragon, phoenix, and other ancient miraculous beasts, showing his extremely unique bloodline.

“You... are dead for sure!” he announced coldly.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “You, are really good at talking big!” Who didn’t know how to speak in declarative.

Hong!

At this moment, the black mist surged; swords and axes covered in frightening vein-like patterns could be seen indistinctly within in, radiating a shockingly cold glare.

Ling Han’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately ran towards the city.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang was furious. Seeing that he was about to unleash his power, this brat actually abandoned the battle? He was just about to curse, but then he also saw the changes in the black mist, instantly feeling a chill inside. He also exerted power on both feet, running towards the city gate.

The Fourth Killing Formation had been activated!
