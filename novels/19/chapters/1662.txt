Chapter 1663: Another visitor from the Celestial Realm

Ling Han also embraced the Empress’s slender waist tightly, going around in a few circles with her in his arms, and only then did he kiss her hard.

Having been parted for eight years, he missed her very much!

The Empress also responded passionately, her icy pride completely dispersed, and she had become a bewitching demoness that could melt anyone with her hot passion. Every inch of her was exuding so much seduction that no one could bear it.

Xiao Gu watched from one side, its head slanted to one side. It couldn’t help but approach, and copied Ling Han’s action in asking for a hug.

“Stop, stop, stop. This is my wife, don’t copy what I do.” Ling Han hurriedly stopped him. Xiao Gu presently did not just like imitating speech, it was beginning to imitate even actions. Usually, it was fine, but when it concerned his wife, hoho, forget about it.

Xiao Gu was confused, and called out “yiyaya”, feeling a bit despondent.

“Who is he?” the Empress asked curiously. Why did he look exactly like Ling Han?

“We’ll talk about it in future.” Ling Han switched to holding the Empress’s hand, and walked towards the Star Sand Saint. Smiling, he asked, “Everyone, have you discovered anything?”

The Star Sand Saint, the Tranquil Heart Saint, and the other Ten Saints of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy were all here. They all shook their heads with a grimace, and replied, “The Celestial medicine is just in front of us, but we can’t get hold of it. This is really depressing.”

“Woof, Little Han, pay your greetings quickly now that you have seen me.” The large black dog ran over. It looked at Xiao Gu, yet all of a sudden, all the black fur on its body bristled.

“Monster!” It jumped up, baring its teeth.

“Monster!” Xiao Gu thought it was fun, and copied it.

“You’re the monster here!” The large black dog was furious.

“You’re the monster here!” Xiao Gu was copying him with great pleasure.

“Don’t copy my words!”

“Don’t copy my words!”

“You are an idiot that doesn’t know how to talk!”

“You are an idiot that doesn’t know how to talk!”

“...”

Whatever the large black dog said, Xiao Gu would imitate him word for word. No matter how the large black dog changed the speed of speech, sometimes quick and sometimes slow, Xiao Gu would always manage to imitate him without any change.

Soon enough, the large black dog suffered a breakdown. He sprawled out on the ground, his ears drooping; whatever he didn’t hear would not make him mad.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly. It was rare to see the large black dog at a disadvantage; this was really bringing satisfaction for everyone.

“Yiyaya!” Meanwhile, Xiao Gu smiled dumbly.

“So you are Ling Han?” The young Saint King from before walked over. He was really very young, only a few tens of thousands years old, but not only had he advanced into the Genesis Tier, he had also reached the peak of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier!

Ling Han’s eyes swept over him, and was startled slightly because he could sense an aura that was different from other Saint Kings on this young Saint King.

Consummate Regulations! Like Han Qi, he had also come from the Celestial Realm.

No wonder he had managed to become a peak stage Saint King at such a young age. Being nurtured with the resources of the Celestial Realm, how could he not advance at such a fast pace? However, compared with Hu Niu, he was completely no match. In a mere five years, Hu Niu was already in the Genesis Tier.

“I am Ling Han, how should I address you?” Ling Han looked at the other man.

“Pang Zhen,” the young Saint King replied, his face bearing an expression of pride.

This was natural. He had come from the Celestial Realm, and everyone here added together was not as precious as a single finger of his. If it was not for the fact that there was a Celestial medicine here, as well as an exquisitely beautiful Empress, how could he possibly have wasted five years’ time here?

Ling Han only gave an ‘oh’, and ignored him after.

‘Y-y-y-you!!’

Pang Zhen couldn’t help but feel angered. What kind of attitude was that? He was only a mere Great Saint, and actually dared put on airs in front of him!

‘Hang on!’

Pang Zhen’s heart shuddered. Such a young Great Saint!

He could no longer see through Ling Han, but was sure that his flame of life had been burning for only 1,000 years at most.

This...

The mere Ancient Realm actually had such a freak?

He involuntarily glanced at the Empress. This exquisite beauty had also reached the peak stage of the Medium Saint Tier, and her battle prowess was even comparable to the peak stage of Saint King Tier! What was going on with the Ancient Realm? Was it specialized in producing freaks?

“Friend Ling!” The Saint Kings from the various Forbidden Lands also greeted Ling Han. When they realized that Ling Han’s cultivation level had already advanced into the Great Saint Tier, they were both astonished and pleased.

Their joy was derived from the fact that they would soon be entering into the Celestial Realm, and their astonishment came from the fact that Ling Han had already reached such heights when only a few years had passed. They felt like they were living in a dream.

Ling Han nodded, and did not become arrogant just because he was capable of overwhelming all elites. He smiled and greeted the Saint Kings. Then, he turned and looked ahead, and asked, “Can’t you pluck that Celestial medicine?”

“Completely impossible!” A young man walked over, his tone aged and experienced.

“You are?” Ling Han looked at him.

“F***, I am the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire!” The youth immediately jumped up and shouted in displeasure.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “We haven’t seen each other for a few years; you’ve grown up!”

“Ptui, don’t say it in such a disgusting way. When I was moving unhindered in the world before, who knows where your ancestors were still drinking milk!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire exclaimed in displeasure.

“Why can’t it be done?” Ling Han returned to the previous topic of conversation.

“The Regulations here are too frightening; they are not something that can be matched by Genesis Tier.” The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire became serious again. “It is still all right now, but there would be violent hurricanes of Regulations streaking out at any time. Going by my estimation, even Immortal Palace Tiers could possibly be plundered to death by these winds.”

Only now did Ling Han really get a shock. Immortal Palace Tiers were already standing on the third tier in the Celestial Realm, and above that would be Ascending Origin Tier and Celestial King Tier. If this kind of Regulations hurricane could plunder Immortal Palace Tiers to death, then the highest level of power here would at least have to be Ascending Origin Tier.

Within a banished ancient land, there actually appeared power on the level of Ascending Origin Tier at least; this was inconceivable!

On the other side, Pang Zhen’s expression was dark, and he felt an urge to commit murder.

He was a prodigy of the Celestial Realm, but look at the situation now. So many people were actually gathering around Ling Han, and even the woman that he had his eye on had thrown herself into Ling Han’s arms.

Humph, these people only wanted to enter into the Celestial Realm, and that was why they were fawning so much on this young man.

A thought flashed in Pang Zhen’s head. He could release some information at an appropriate time; not only was he capable of opening the doors to the Celestial Realm, he himself was even the descendant of a great force of the Celestial Realm.

...You mere Genesis Tiers would only be ants after entering into the Celestial Realm, so how would you be able to survive without depending on the backing of a great force?

However, he did not dare take anyone into the Celestial Realm. This was an iron-clad rule of the Celestial Realm. If it was discovered that anyone had secretly brought anyone into the Celestial Realm, there would be a Celestial King-level force that would arrive personally and annihilate the entire clan!

Something like that had happened in the past. In an Ascending Origin Tier-level force, there was a junior that had entered into the Ancient Realm for training, and developed an ill-fated relationship. He was cruel, and abandoned the woman, only bringing his own child into the Celestial Realm, but what was the result?

In a moment of carelessness, it was discovered that the child was born in the Ancient Realm, and it resulted in the entire force being eliminated overnight.

That was an Ascending Origin Tier-level force!

Thus, he would only use the Celestial Realm as a pretense at most, and compete with Ling Han in popularity, but to actually bring anyone into the Celestial Realm? Hoho, he would not dare do such a thing even if they beheaded him.

This bunch of country bumpkins had absolutely no idea how strict the Celestial Realm was about the matter of “illegal immigration”!
