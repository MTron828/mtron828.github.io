Chapter 1747: Not down-to-earth

Ling Han glanced at him, smiled, and asked, “You are?”

The Qi Clan elite was shaking with fury. ‘You have already killed two of our clansmen, and you actually dare to ask who I am?’ He harshly retorted, “Let’s see where you can run to this time!”

He then made a brazen move.

There was no rule here that stated fighting was disallowed, and in a battle of a second severance against a first severance, this was absolute domination.

The Fu Clan elite that was overseer here had initially wanted to interfere, but after some thought, the behind that he had just raised sunk back down.

Rules would be rules.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Old geezer, you wanted to take my wooden raft forcefully just because your cultivation level was higher than mine, and had thus caused the deaths of your own clansmen. Instead of reflecting on your own actions, you push all the blame onto others. Don’t you think that is shameful of you?”

“Die!” When the Qi Clan elite moved, he was slightly careful. He naturally feared angering the Fu Clan. That would be a devastating calamity to a mere Qi Clan. However, when he saw that the elite who was overseer here had no intention to stop him, his intense hatred suddenly rose.

Boom, the speed of his move instantly quickened tenfold, and it descended down on Ling Han.

Those standing on the sidelines all jumped aside, fearing that they would be dragged into the matter.

This was a second severance elite!

Pa!

Ling Han raised his hand and lowered it, firmly delivering a slap to that Qi Clan elite. He had used so much force that the latter spun a good few times on the spot.

When they saw this, everyone was practically gaping with their mouths wide open.

Had their sight blurred?

It was Ling Han who was the second severance, and the Qi Clan elite was only a first severance? Or it was the Qi Clan elite that had slapped Ling Han?

But they looked closer, and the end result had not changed in the slightest.

The Qi Clan elite had just barely steadied his footing, his left cheek very swollen, and his eyes filled with little stars of disbelief[1].

He had actually been slapped! By a mere first severance junior!

How was this possible?

When they were in the Severing Mundane Pool, he had absolutely dominated over Ling Han, forcing the latter to have no choice but to flee pathetically, and though the latter had advanced into the Severing Mundane now, he, too, had successfully advanced into the second severance, so he should still be dominating him.

He did not dare believe this; he could not.

“You’re not awake yet?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Pa, Ling Han delivered another slap, which landed on the other cheek of the Qi Clan elite, causing him to spin around again.

...Putting aside the fact that the Qi Clan elite had just advanced into the second severance, even if he had reached the peak stage of the second severance, faced with Ling Han, he would still be easily suppressed.

Everyone was completely dumbfounded by the scene, thinking that what the elders said about how a second severance would absolutely crush a first severance was all lies. Looking at this scene was a loud slap right into their faces.

“I will kill you!” the Qi Clan elite roared loudly. Boom, he ignited his life force. A boundless golden light surged out from within his body, turning into multiple golden blades. It was as if he had become a porcupine.

He pounced at Ling Han. The golden swords shot forwards, the power directly approaching the peak stage of the second severance.

Igniting one’s life force was an action of putting one’s life on the line. If life force was damaged, then not only would one’s cultivation level have no hope of advancing further, his battle prowess would also drop drastically. Though Severing Mundane Tier grand elders would not die because of this, how could they survive the Immortal’s Tribulation in future?

However, life force could still be restored through the use of Celestial medicine. The Qi Clan elite only had one thought in mind now, and that was to kill Ling Han. Otherwise, how would he be able to face others in future?

Ling Han’s look became sinister. Previously, the Qi Clan had attempted to snatch his wooden raft from him in the Severing Mundane Pool. Though he had killed two of them, he had still been forced to flee in the end. He had not sought this old geezer for an accounting yet, and the latter had delivered himself right up to his doorstep.

Whom was he going to kill if not him?

Ling Han swiped his palm to one side, and slashed out like the blade of a sword.

Pu, the Qi Clan elite was immediately sliced in half by a flash of Sword Qi. Blood sprayed out, and his spirit was not spared, either. It had been forcibly sliced into two.

However, the vitality of a second severance elite was really tenacious. The two halves of the miniature human that the spirit had taken form of still wanted to merge back into one. Unfortunately, Ling Han had used the Regulations of the Nine Heavens Flame and the Xuanyin Source Water in this strike.

A spirit that had been sliced in two actually wanted to survive the hit?

There was absolutely no way!

The two halves of the spirit struggled for a while, but could only be destroyed. A vast vitality and life energy returned to the heaven and earth, but because this was an enclosed space, it suddenly caused the surrounding plants to grow like mad.

Everyone was looking at Ling Han dumbly as if they were watching a monster.

Even that Fu Clan elite looked constipated because even in a three-star force like the Fu Clan, Severing Mundane Tier elites would not easily die, either. Celestial level elites were really hard to kill.

But right in front of him, a second severance elite had been slaughtered like a pig, causing him to shiver as well.

It should be known that he, too, was only a second severance!

This young man was clearly only in the first severance; how could he possibly be so strong?

His expression filled with respect, he stood up, and said, “Sir, you can pass through.”

What a joke; how could he not receive such a prodigy with absolute respect?

Ling Han proficiently searched out the Spatial God Tool from the body of the Qi Clan elite. Then, he nodded at the Fu Clan elite, and left with the Empress.

This time, there weren’t even any objections.

Would they want to die?

Song Ji’s and Ma Ying’s mouth was twitching. They both thought that they were prodigies, but when they saw Ling Han move, they suddenly realized just how far off they were from a real king tier.

After this stage, there was no other person blocking the way.

Ling Han and the Empress arrived at the summit. There was a person dressed in white here. He was very young, and sat in a cross-legged position on the ground. There was a table in front of him, on which lay a qin[2]. He was presently strumming the strings lightly, producing a divine tinkling sound.

“Please listen to a song of Dispersing Celestial Clouds from me,” the white robed person stated with a smile, showing two rows of snow white teeth. His locks were ink black, each strand shimmering slightly. “Before the song ends, you can pick up the stamp on the table and lay down a stamp. Otherwise, please return from whence you came.”

So there was a fourth test!

“Since someone wants to give us a performance, let’s listen then,” Ling Han said to the Empress.

The Empress nodded, and lightly leaned into Ling Han’s arms.

The white-robed young man gritted his teeth at the scene. To actually act so lovey-dovey in front of him; were they bullying a lonely bachelor like him?

He calmed his heart, and his hands suddenly moved. The sound of the qin immediately rang out. It was indescribably melodious, causing one to unconsciously be enraptured by the music.

The young man was very proud. Actually, there was no fourth test. He had only come here to sit here on a spontaneous whim. He wanted to see if the so-called king tiers would be able to survive his song of Dispersing Celestial Clouds.

So far, only a bare two people had just barely passed his test, and it was because he had let them off easily at the last minute. Otherwise, not a single person would have passed.

But he had just strummed a few strokes when he immediately looked shocked. That was because Ling Han’s and the Empress’s eyes were clear. Neither seemed to have been enraptured by the melody of the song.

What strong force of will.

Ling Han smiled and said, “The song is noble and solitary. You are not being down-to-earth. Just take a look at me.”

He drew out a few bowls, and upended them on the ground. Then, with his hands holding a chopstick each, he began to strike them continuously. There was no order to his movements at all, and they were extremely chaotic, yet like a demonic tune penetrated his brain and bones.

The white-robed young man was actually affected unconsciously. The sound of his song immediately changed, completely brought out of tune with Ling Han’s interference.

F***, was this Descending Lotus Flowers? Had he become one of the Beggar Tribe[3]?

[3] 莲花落 is an art of music that was invented by 丐帮, or the so-called Beggar Tribe, a little bit like Chinese version of rap, and the ‘song’ is produced by using a pair of bamboo boards to ring out a tune, kind of like beatbox.
