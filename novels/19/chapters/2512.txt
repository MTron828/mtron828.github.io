Chapter 2513: Tearing Apart a Battle Armor with Bare Hands

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yang Zhixuan also hadn’t imagined that Ling Han would dare to talk back to him. He faltered for a brief moment before coming to his senses.

However, he wasn’t enraged. After all, did a mighty Celestial King need to take the words of such a measly person to heart?

He could simply end the conversation by smacking them to death, couldn’t he?

However, such naive youths were truly rare to come across. He was slightly intrigued, and he said, “Brat, do you not understand that might is right in this world? My cultivation is far superior to yours, so much so that I can squish you to death with a single finger. Are you not afraid?”

Ling Han laughed as he raised his right hand, clenching it into a fist. “I can also smash you to death with a single punch. Do you believe me?”

Yang Zhixuan faltered upon hearing this. He then burst into loud laughter. Where in the world had this naive youth come from? What an extremely fun person! It was because of this that he hadn’t developed killing intent, either. However, a thought suddenly occurred to him, and he immediately summoned a sword that pierced at Ling Han.

He simply wanted to make Ling Han suffer a little and teach him a lesson.

Weng!

The tip of the sword immediately reached Ling Han’s chest.

Ling Han immediately lashed out.

Peng!

His fist smashed into the tip of the sword, instantly causing the sword to shatter. Before Yang Zhixuan could even react, Ling Han’s fist continued to surge forward.

Peng!

......

The fist smashed into Yang Zhixuan’s chin.

A person instantly soared into the sky, quickly transforming into a small black dot.

“What’s going on?” someone asked. There were naturally spectators around them, and these people couldn’t help but grimace. They all wore stupefied expressions.

Where was Yang Zhixuan?

Why had he suddenly run away?

Even if they were beaten to death, they would still refuse to believe that he had been sent flying by Ling Han’s punch.

Even Xu Qiang and Tang Chi didn’t believe this. With their vision, they naturally couldn’t have seen the exchange anyway. After all, even Yang Zhixuan hadn’t had the time to react. That being the case, how could measly Ascending Origin Tier cultivators have hoped to catch Ling Han’s movement?

Thus, they all believed that Yang Zhixuan had left by himself. Perhaps… something urgent had suddenly come up. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Tsk. This Celestial King was truly a benevolent person. Even though he had left for an urgent matter, he could have still smacked Ling Han to death with a single palm. Killing him would have been as easy as killing a fly.

However, he hadn’t done that. Just how benevolent was he?

“How detestable!”

However, just as they were all praising him, a loud roar suddenly traveled over. Yang Zhixuan appeared before them again.

He was striding through the air, and there was a clear lump on his chin. There was also blood seeping from the corners of his mouth, and when he opened it to speak, it was also clear that he had lost several teeth.

‘Huh? What’s going on?

‘Perhaps Yang Zhixuan hurried away to fight someone else just then? But the battle was so quick that he’s already finished? Anyhow, whom is he roaring at?’

Ling Han ignored him. He had initially wanted to smash Yang Zhixuan to death with a single punch. However, since Yang Zhixuan hadn’t attacked him with killing intent, he also decided to show some mercy. He simply gave him a lesson.

After all, there was indeed no great animosity between them.

He retrieved another nine fire-element crystals, and handed them to the middle-aged man. He then grabbed the cauldron, and placed it in his Spatial Celestial Tool.

“I truly underestimated you. You’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing! Very well!” Yang Zhixuan said in a baleful voice. He had truly been far too reckless. It was because of this that he had been struck by Ling Han. At the very least, this was what he believed.

‘Wh-what?’

Everyone went numb with shock upon hearing this.

Yang Zhixuan’s wound had been caused by Ling Han? Otherwise, why had he said that?

However, how was this possible?

What was Ling Han’s cultivation level? If he could send a Celestial King flying with a single punch, wouldn’t the entire cultivation system be upheaved?

Only at this moment did Ling Han glance up at Yang Zhixuan, saying, “If you want to speak, then come down to speak. Do you not know that this is extremely disrespectful?”

Yang Zhixuan was enraged upon hearing this. He was being disrespectful? And the punch just then was respectful? His expression was baleful, and he said, “Into the sky for a battle!”

There were far too many passers-by here, so even though it would be fine to kill a few, wreaking too much havoc would definitely invite punishment from the higher-level Celestial Kings.

Ling Han frowned and said, “You still haven’t learned your lesson?”

“Enough with the nonsense!” Yang Zhixuan roared.

Peng!

Ling Han bent his knees and launched up using his explosive leg power, not relying on the power of Regulations at all. Even though he was simply using brute strength, his speed was still astonishing.

He couldn’t fly using the power of Regulations, since he only possessed the power of Regulations at the Dividing Soul Tier. As such, his flying speed would be as slow as a snail. If he fought like this, could he ever hope to hit his opponent?

However, the speed of his jump was insane, and he arrived before Yang Zhixuan in a flash. He then threw another punch.

Xiu!

Yang Zhixuan was sent flying again.

Boom!

There was a deafening boom as Ling Han landed back on the ground. His violent landing created a huge crater, and it also unleashed a massive shock wave that sent the people in the surroundings sprawling.

Everyone was transfixed with shock upon seeing this. Even though they hadn’t seen the situation clearly, it was without a doubt that Yang Zhixuan had been sent flying again. Moreover, the culprit was none other than Ling Han.

‘Gasp! Holy mother of God!’

Xu Qiang and Tang Chi were both numb with shock. They were more so overcome with an indescribable feeling.

Thinking back, they had still been referring to Ling Han as a friend and brother. In fact, they had even teased him before. However, as it turned out, Ling Han hadn’t lied to them at all.

They had actually been treated as equals while messing around with such a person! Who would believe this?

“Aaah!!!” Yang Zhixuan flew back again, with his face comprehensively ruined now. It was filled with blood, and he appeared both ferocious and disheveled. He stared daggers at Ling Han, and his eyes were filled with raging fury.

This was utter humiliation! Utter humiliation!

Just then, he had defeated Doka in battle, greatly elevating his reputation and standing. After all, he had defeated a proper disciple as a follower! Now, however, he had been sent flying twice by an unknown brat who wasn’t even a Celestial King!

These were the great ups and downs of life. It was truly a stimulating spectacle.

However, this second punch finally allowed him to recognize the strength of Ling Han. He couldn’t have avoided these punches by simply being careful.

He humphed as he summoned his Battle Armor again, completely covering himself up.

This instantly filled him with confidence and self-belief.

With the protection of the Battle Armor, he was already standing in a position of definite victory.

“Do you dare to battle me?” he roared.

Ling Han was like a delighted predator seeing his prey. He indeed wanted to test out the strength of this Battle Armor. He wanted to see how many of his punches it could withstand.

Peng!

He unleashed his explosive power again, shooting into the sky. Yang Zhixuan couldn’t react at all, and a forceful fist had already slammed into his chest.

Under the powerful force of the punch, the symbols on the Battle Armor all lit up, forming a layer of light on the surface of the armor. This layer of light was a powerful defensive mechanism. Indeed, this was the first defensive line of the Battle Armor.

However, the formidable power of the punch instantly shattered this layer of light, ripping through its defenses. Meanwhile, the punch continued to surge forward. If time were slowed down 10,000-fold, one would be able to see the armor denting inward, forming a deep crater that was eventually unable to resist the stress. In the end, the armor completely collapsed and shattered.

Just as Ling Han had predicted before, as long as one’s power was formidable enough to surpass the limit of the Battle Armor’s regenerative ability, they would be completely capable of destroying it with brute strength.

Ling Han unleashed a roar as he swung both his fists. Like a piece of thin cloth, the Battle Armor was instantly torn to shreds.

Like a weak and defenseless young girl, Yang Zhixuan stood there with his mouth wide agape, unable to make a single sound.

Even though it was only his Battle Armor that had been torn apart, he felt as if it were his clothes that had been ripped off, completely exposing him to everyone. This was utterly humiliating.

Beneath them, everyone was transfixed with utter shock.

Tearing apart a suit of Battle Armor with his bare hands… Could he refrain from being so violent?!
