Chapter 2086: Black Tortoise Earth Pill

ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

One pill concoction contest had actually led to the emergence of two Four-Star grandmasters!

This was something that had never occurred in previous alchemy competitions.

It was exciting!

Now only would there be suspense about the final results. Otherwise, if the candidate for champion had already been determined before the third contest had even begun, how boring would that be?

Pa, right at this moment, the doors of an alchemy chamber opened, and a third prodigy of alchemy walked out.

Xie Yuezhang.

“No way, has he also advanced into the ranks of Four-Star grandmasters?”

“Hard to say.”

“That’s right. If someone had told me that one alchemy competition could actually help three people to simultaneously break through to become Four-Star grandmasters in the past, I would never have believed it. But now… I really can’t be certain.”

Xie Yuezhang’s face still bore a faint smile, and he spread open the palm of his right hand. There was a dark green alchemical pill lying within.

“Is this a Green Jade Pill?”

“Very similar, but the Green Jade Pill is only Three Stars.”

“Sigh, in the end, Xie Yuezhang had not continued the legend and maintained the amazing feat of advancement that would happen only once in a billion years.”

“That is not realistic, after all. How many people would be able to do so?”

Everyone shook their head, feeling that it was really a shame for Xie Yuezhang. In the contest among several great prodigies of alchemy, someone had finally fallen behind.

However, the eyes of that alchemist responsible for invigilation lit up. He looked at that dark green alchemical pill for a while, and solemnly declared, “Three golden dragon veins are faintly discernible. This is not the Green Jade PIll, but rather the Golden Dragon Sea Waves Pill!”

“What!?”

Hearing this kind of evaluation, everyone erupted in a commotion. The Golden Dragon Sea Waves Pill was a genuine Four-Stars alchemical pill.

Hiss, this was another newly promoted Four-Star grandmaster!

Heavens, what day was it today? Four-Star grandmasters emerged one after another, as if the heavens themselves were bestowing good fortune on this day.

“This is like having encountered an age of prosperity for cultivation. Sometimes, several hundred billion years would pass, and not a single Celestial King would emerge, but when it is an age with prodigies emerging frequently, there will also be a wave-like appearance of Celestial Kings, and their numbers would be greatly astonishing.”

“Still, to personally witness this scene would make me numb with shock!”

A smile of pride curled up the corners of Xie Yuezhang’s lips. Then, he turned to look over at Wu Zixu and Alchemist Riyang.

There was no need for him to show them reverence, because they were all Four-Star grandmasters.

Next, it would be up to their standards in Spirit Refinement. Fifth Refinement was definite, but the exact standards were definitely going to be different.

Zhi, right at this moment, Fan Luoling also walked out.

Before anyone could react, she stretched out her hand to the alchemist in charge of invigilation. The latter also quickly took it over. The whole process was astonishingly fast. In fact, because of the cover provided by both of their sleeves, others did not even know what that alchemical pill looked like.

“Black Gold Celestial Bone Pill, Four Stars, low grade!” That alchemist spread open his right hand, and there was an alchemical pill as dark as iron in the palm of his hand.

Another Four-Star grandmaster?

Everyone exchanged looks. However, no one made a fuss this time. Instead, they all looked incredibly doubtful.

What did they mean by their actions?

There was a clear rule that the crystal walls of the alchemy chamber had to be absolutely transparent so those outside could observe clearly. Furthermore, when the alchemical pill was submitted, the alchemical pill also had to be very obviously displayed.

This was to prevent any form of cheating.

However, when Fan Luoling was concocting her alchemical pill, the crystal walls were very blurry and unclear, and the spectators could not see clearly at all. Moreover, the time when she submitted her alchemical pill was also incredibly ambiguous.

And now an alchemical pill had been suddenly produced, announcing that she had concocted a Four-Star alchemical pill. How could they be convinced?

Hence, after a momentary silence, the area immediately erupted into chaos. A considerable number of people raised objections.

…It was not like the relationship between Fan Luoling and Yuan Tongguang was unknown, and now for them to suddenly do something like this, who would not suspect that there was something off here?

“What’s all the noise about?” Yuan Tongguang appeared, his eyes sweeping over the masses, his gaze bearing a lot of disdain. “Don’t you know that this will affect the others competing? Whoever dares to argue will be immediately removed!”

This kind of attitude caused even more displeasure. Weren’t you guys just clearly cheating like this?

“I request that this Black Gold Celestial Bone Pill’s age is examined,” someone suddenly proclaimed.

“That’s right, examine the age!” This suggestion obtained the approval of a great number.

If this alchemical pill had been concocted by Fan Luoling, then the time of pill concoction definitely could not surpass three years—added with the time acceleration effects. Thus, if it had surpassed this age, it had to have been concocted by someone else.

“Examine the age as a show of fairness!”

“Fairness!”

“Fairness!”

More and more people were calling out in suit. Some were indeed filled with a great sense of righteousness, while some were merely delighting in the chaos.

Yuan Tongguang’s expression was very ugly, his face extremely dark.

As the grandson of a great elder of the Ancient Alchemy Tower, couldn’t he even settle this small matter?

Didn’t he just want a championship? What was so difficult about it?

Zhi, right at this moment, the doors of an alchemy chamber were opened once more, and Lin Yongchang walked out.

With a casual toss, he threw out a crimson red alchemical pill.

“Crimson Flame Earth Fire Pill!” Lin Yongchang’s invigilator alchemist couldn’t help but stretch out his hand to catch it. His eyes swept over it, and an expression of shock immediately came over his face because this was yet another Four Stars alchemical pill.

“What!?”

“This is too amazing!”

Everyone was exclaiming in shock. A great many people had been stunned by this news, and had temporarily forgotten the matter of investigating Fan Luoling.

“Grade… medium!”

Immediately, the uproar in the masses became even louder!

Medium grade, it was actually medium grade!

While those like Xie Yuezhang and Alchemist Riyang had concocted Four-Star alchemical pills as well, those had only reached low grade. This was actually very normal. Who would be able to reach medium grade immediately upon advancing to become a Four-Star Alchemist?

However, Lin Yongchang was an exception.

No, no, no. No one could be an exception. For this person to be able to concoct a medium grade Four Stars alchemical pill, there could only be one possibility.

He had long since become a Four-Star Alchemist!

Heavens, so young.

The flame of life would tell no lies. This guy had only been alive for several hundred million years at most, yet he was actually a Four-Star grandmaster.

Inconceivable, this was too inconceivable!

Everyone looked at Lin Yongchang with eyes filled with reverence. They could not help admitting that they were impressed by such a young Four-Star grandmaster, and one whose standards of pill concoction had reached medium standard at that.

Lin Yongchang showed a reserved smile. All he had to do now was wait for Ling Han to come out. He would first humiliate this guy, and then announce his withdrawal from the competition in a high-profile manner, and that would be posh enough.

Very coincidentally, the doors of the final alchemy chamber were also pushed open, and Ling Han appeared.

He looked a little battered, with specks of black on his robes. Those had resulted from the cauldron exploding, and he had not managed to tidy up previously.

“Ling Han, where is your alchemical pill?” Lin Yongchang spoke up. He could no longer wait to deliver a strike on Ling Han’s pride.

Ling Han glanced at him, and countered, “What are you rushing me for? Are you the invigilator?”

Lin Yongchang’s face couldn’t help but flush red with this rebuff, showing an expression of indignation and anger. However, he knew that he was no match for Ling Han, so it was naturally impossible that he would take the initiative to seek his own humiliation. He could only glare angrily at Ling Han.

He only had to wait a while longer. There was no need for him to lose his cool.

Ling Han did not cast a second look at Lin Yongchang. Spreading open his right hand, there was a crystalline, almost transparent, alchemical pill lying in the palm of his hand. There was a green tortoise in the core of the pill. It was tiny, yet looked vivid and realistic. It was even moving its four limbs, as if it was about to swim out of the alchemical pill.

“Black Tortoise Earth Pill!” Immediately, those in the surroundings all exclaimed in shock.

Four Stars alchemical pill, and the difficulty level of pill concoction was not low, either!
