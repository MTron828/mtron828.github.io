2891 Chapter 2893 White Flames Heavenly Venerate

Ling Han glanced around the surroundings. The promised Fifth Tier was nowhere to be seen, but he did see someone else.

The White Flames Heavenly Venerate.

Back when Ling Han had obtained the Ninth Seal in the overlapping space of Realm Battlefield, he had had to escape to Ling City soon after as the dimension had immediately crumbled. However, he had been quickly surrounded and hunted down by a group of Heavenly Venerates, one of whom had been the White Flames Heavenly Venerate.

Back then, Ling Han had simply said one thing: “I’ll remember you.”

!!

However, Ling Han had been only at the First Tier at the time, and couldn’t have competed with someone at the Fourth Tier. Once he had reached the Second Tier, given the vastness of the world, he had had trouble locating the White Flames Heavenly Venerate. Not to mention, he had had so much going on that he had completely forgotten about the matter.

He had never thought that he would bump into the White Flames Heavenly Venerate here.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. “I’ve been waiting for you all. However, all of you are only Fourth Tiers. That’s not nearly enough for me to be satisfied.”

“Insolent boy!” remarked an old man in red robes. As a Fourth Tier, he didn’t think a Third Tier was worth his attention. Naturally, he assumed that Ling Han was simply courting death. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Haha, it’s little wonder that he would be so brash seeing as there’s a Fourth Tier backing him up,” said another youth in purple robes. While his appearance was young, he had actually lived countless epochs, and was also at the Fourth Tier.

As he said that, he looked towards Hu Niu. As a Heavenly Venerate of the same level, he could tell the latter’s cultivation at a glance.

The White Flames Heavenly Venerate was more cautious, however, and said, “Everyone, don’t underestimate this youngster. He’s Ling Han.”

“Ling Han?” The rest of the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates revealed a look of surprise. It seemed that they had heard of this name before.

The purple-robed Fourth Tier clasped his hands suddenly, and said, “Is he that Ling Han? The kid who set a new record in the Realm Battlefield?”

At the time, Ling Han had been merely at the First Tier. Naturally, he seemed like a child to him.

The rest of them were equally astonished. It had only been a few million years, and for one to rise from First Tier to Third Tier in that short amount of time was simply too shocking of a growth speed.

They soon started having second thoughts. Was it worth it to court the resentment of a rising star with limitless potential for the sake of a single vein of ore?

Even if they could suppress Ling Han now, what about 10,000,000 or even 100,000,000 years later?

Once Ling Han became a Fifth Tier, wouldn’t their positions be completely reversed?

Fortunately for them, it was highly difficult for a Fourth Tier to break through to the Fifth Tier. Even people like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu were still stuck in the Fourth Tier after spending over an epoch trying. This proved how difficult it was to cross that gap.

If the three greatest prodigies had it so tough, then what more of Ling Han? How could he possibly compare to them?

As such, they were simply considering if they should be courteous towards this future powerhouse. They still believed that they had the upper hand, and could make the first move.

“Ling Han, your performance in the Realm Battlefield was astounding. On account of this, we are willing to let you have this ore vein,” said the red-robed Fourth Tier. He then continued, “However, these youngsters were all beaten up by you. We’ll let this matter go if you apologize.”

In his eyes, this was being more than courteous enough towards Ling Han, and it was merely on account of his potential growth. Had it been any other Third Tier, he would have suppressed them long ago, and would not have been so polite.

Ling Han smiled. “First off, we found this ore vein to begin with, and were already in the midst of mining it. What you’re doing is robbery. Where did you get the idea that you were letting me have it? Secondly, those people insulted us, so I was simply teaching them a lesson. They’re lucky enough I didn’t kill them.”

The purple-robed Fourth Tier glared. “So you don’t want to apologize then?”

Ling Han paid him no heed. He turned to look at the White Flames Heavenly Venerate, and said, “Little White, I remember I told you before that I’d come find you, didn’t I?”

Little White?

The White Flames Heavenly Venerate couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow as he felt an urge to fight. However, he knew what a monster Ling Han was, being able to fight Third Tiers back when he had been at the First Tier. Even though it was less likely to be able to fight against someone on a higher level the more one’s strength increased, this kid should still be able to fight Fourth Tiers as a Third Tier.

Hence, he suppressed his impulse as he wasn’t entirely sure he could win against Ling Han one on one. He needed to get the rest to band together with him at least.

The White Flames smiled. “I’ve seen plenty of small fry like you. How could I possibly remember everything they say?”

Previously, he hadn’t thought Ling Han would’ve amounted to anything at all. Little had he expected that Ling Han would’ve progressed to the Third Tier and become an existence that could threaten him within a mere few million years.

Ling Han laughed. “Then let’s clear our old debts today.”

“Young man, you are too cocky!” scoffed a blue-robed Fourth Tier. He was completely annoyed by Ling Han’s behavior. Within Heavenly Venerable Tier, hierarchy was extremely strict. No one would be as arrogant as Ling Han.

He was right. As long as one was a Heavenly Venerate, one stood at the pinnacle of the realm. Even if a First Tier were to meet a Seventh Tier, all they needed to do was cup their hands and greet respectfully. However, this was no indication that a First Tier would be able to act cocky in front of a Seventh Tier.

As such, Ling Han’s cocky attitude had ignited a fury in all of them.

He was merely a Third Tier.

Ling Han raised his shoulders, and said, “Cocky, am I? That’s just because I have the strength to back it up.”

The purple-robed Fourth Tier was utterly speechless. Where did this brat get the audacity to speak such insolent things?

“It seems a peaceful resolution is out of the picture,” the White Flames Heavenly Venerate said coldly. He was not surprised at this turn of events. Back when Ling Han had still been a First Tier, he had been just as arrogant in front of an even larger number of Fourth Tiers. As such, the White Flames didn’t find it strange that things would turn out like this.

“Ling Han, don’t waste your breath on them. Let’s fight!” Hu Niu chimed in, being the battle maniac that she was. She opened her little mouth to reveal two sharp canines.

Ling Han looked towards the White Flames Heavenly Venerate, and said, “Little White, are you brave enough to fight me? I won’t be too hard on you. I’ll use only one hand.”

To a Heavenly Venerate, there was no difference between using both hands or a single finger. However, Ling Han’s words were clearly meant to provoke, and the White Flames Heavenly Venerate’s expression quickly turned dark.

No matter how much of a monster Ling Han was, the mere act of a Third Tier mocking him made him very upset.

“Hmph, let me teach you some manners!” The purple-robed Fourth Tier struck out and tried to suppress Ling Han.

To him, Ling Han was nothing but a mere Third Tier. No matter how legendary the rumors made him out to be, there was no way he could compete against a Fourth Tier.

Ling Han shook his head, and then waved his left hand towards the purple-robed Fourth Tier.

Peng!

A loud noise resounded, and the surrounding mountains crumbled one after another. Even the skies were quaking under the terrifying force.

The purple-robed Fourth Tier couldn’t stop himself from falling backwards, finally coming to a halt after a dozen steps. However, to a Heavenly Venerate, a simple step was sufficient to cross a considerable distance, and the purple-robed Fourth Tier soon vanished from sight. Coming back as quickly as he had retreated, the purple-robed Fourth Tier soon reappeared using a few steps.

He was shocked to see that Ling Han had not moved a single inch. It was as though their roles were reversed, and Ling Han was the Fourth Tier.
