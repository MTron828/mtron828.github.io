1285 All-out Assaul

An army of 1,000,000 soldiers, all of them at the Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, the generals that led them were all Heavenly Body Tier elites. It was a formidable army that was capable of crushing their enemies.

The fact that Heavenly Body Tier elites had now been deployed was a frightening development. With them in the frontlines, would Eternal River Tier elites be far behind?

Was a calamitous war about to descend?

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. Was he a bringer of misfortune? It seemed like trouble would brew wherever he went...

“Humph!” Someone in the Netherworld army discovered Ling Han, and 100 or so people immediately flew over, all of them wielding weapons that radiated with a sinister aura.

“Run!” Ling Han immediately shouted.

He wasn’t scared of these 100 or so people. However, there were Heavenly Body Tier elites in the Netherworld army, and he was definitely no match for these beings.

Staying behind and fighting wouldn’t be bravery—it would be stupidity.

Rabbit and old ginseng didn’t need Ling Han’s reminder at all. They had started to flee before he had even shouted in warning.

“F*ck! You two are so loyal!” Ling Han shouted as he hurriedly activated the Star Plucking Step.

“You’re the strongest out of us three. If you don’t stay back to fight, who will?” the old ginseng said.

“Exactly,” Rabbit said in agreement.

“Stop!” the Netherworld soldiers shouted. They pursued Ling Han and the others with vigor, yet the distance between them grew larger and larger. The difference in their speed was significant.

Ling Han and the others fled far into the distance. However, just when they thought they had shaken off their pursuers, they heard a soft humph, and a person silently appeared before them.

This person was dressed in white, and he was an extremely handsome man. If it weren’t for his overwhelmingly sinister aura, one wouldn’t be able to tell that he was a Netherworld being. Anyhow, such a powerful and sinister aura indicated that this man possessed a very high cultivation level.

He was a Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Ling Han’s heart shuddered in apprehension. He reached out and grabbed Rabbit and the old ginseng, one in each hand. He was prepared to enter the Black Tower at any moment. Now that he was facing such a powerful elite, there was no time for him to worry about exposing the secret of the Black Tower.

“There’s no need to be so tense. I’m only here to ask you a question,” the man in white said with a smile. His charismatic smile revealed his brilliant white teeth.

Ling Han also smiled, and said, “What will you do after asking the question?”

“I’ll naturally kill you all. This information is far too sensitive, and I can’t leave any survivors,” the man in white said calmly.

‘F*ck!’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Fine, ask away!”

“Young man, you’re very courageous!” the man in white exclaimed. He stared at Ling Han for a moment, and a look of surprise involuntarily spread across his face. “What cultivation technique are you practicing? It’s actually able to return you to youth?”

As a Heavenly Body Tier elite, he could naturally see through Ling Han’s disguise. This was unlike the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, who had only noticed that there was something strange about Ling Han. However, she hadn’t been able to put her finger on what was wrong.

Ling Han’s expression became serious, and he said, “The cultivation technique that I practice is the most profound in heaven and earth, and it’s peerless throughout the past and future. It’s none other than the Heavenly Mystery Technique!”

The man in white laughed heartily, and said, “Young man, you’re like a newborn calf that isn’t afraid of tigers! You even dare to joke around with me! So be it, I’ll directly pluck your soul. That way, I’ll find out about all your secrets.”

He reached over, and his hand transformed into a vast expanse of sky that bore down upon Ling Han. His palm had yet to arrive, yet a devastating aura had already rendered Ling Han immobile.

This was the overwhelming power of a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Regardless of how prodigious one was, there was no way they could withstand such power.

However, it was a shame that he had only used his aura to suppress Ling Han, and not used his martial intent.

Xiu!

There was a flash, and Ling Han, Rabbit, and the old ginseng all vanished.

“Huh?” Astonishment spread across his face. What was going on? How had the three of them suddenly disappeared? If they had used a teleportation talisman... he should have been able to detect the fluctuations caused by the tearing of space.

“Spatial God Tool?” He scanned the surroundings. As small as Spatial God Tools could become, there should still be clues that revealed their location. However, he couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary no matter how carefully he scanned the surrounding land.

“I don’t believe this!” He grabbed the earth within a 500-kilometer radius, and then used his profound power to refine the earth into nothingness. After obliterating everything else, the last remaining matter would naturally be the Spatial God Tool.

The power of Heavenly Body Tier elites was incredible, and the earth in this place only consisted of ordinary dirt and stones. So, how could it withstand his refinement? The man in white easily obliterated the mountain of earth into nothingness. Doing so only took him a mere three days.

However, after refining all this land, a look of pure astonishment spread across on the man in white’s face.

He hadn’t found any Spatial God Tool!

‘How is this possible?!’

“Perhaps he didn’t hide in a Spatial God Tool?” he murmured to himself. “But there’s no way he could have used a teleportation talisman!” He wasn’t willing to give up, and he continued to scour the surroundings. However, he came up empty-handed.

If this were some other time, he wouldn’t mind scouring this place for four or five years. After all, the lifespan of Heavenly Body Tier elites was incredibly long. However, he was shouldering an important mission at this moment.

“I’ll deal with the proper matters first,” he muttered. After reaching this decision, he took a huge step and appeared hundreds of kilometers in the distance.

Ling Han, Rabbit, and the old ginseng all breathed a long sigh of relief. If the man in white had decided to stay here, they wouldn’t have dared to come back out at all.

“Strange, why is the Netherworld suddenly launching an all-out assault?” Ling Han asked in confusion.

Although this was the Two Realm Battlefield, where battle and death were extremely common, deploying an army of 1,000,000 Sun Moon Tier cultivators and thousands of Heavenly Body Tier elites was still very surprising. Doing so would elevate the conflict from small skirmishes to all-out war.

‘So be it if there are Heavenly Body Tier elites. However, if Eternal River Tier elites join in, even Heavenly Body Tier elites will become nothing but cannon fodder.’

Ling Han’s mind turned to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. She was in the Purple Moon Army at this moment, and such an army would definitely have to join the battlefield if a war did eventually break out.

With the severity of the current situation, it wouldn’t matter whether one had retired or not. They would be forced to enter the battlefield regardless.

‘No, I have to hurry back to her!’ Ling Han reached a decision in his mind.

He exited the Black Tower and hurried back to Wolf Fang City.

The three legions were all camped outside Wolf Fang City, and they protected this line of defense with a curved horn formation. Once this line of defense fell, the Netherworld would be able to march through this city and invade the entire Cloud Apex Planet. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Han was as quick as the wind, and he arrived at the encampment of the Purple Moon Army in no time at all. However, upon his arrival, he discovered that the encampment was already devoid of people.

It was clear that the Purple Moon Army had already been deployed to meet the Netherworld army.

“It seems like... the problem is far more severe than I had thought!” Ling Han muttered to himself. By the looks of it, the Netherworld had even deployed Eternal River Tier elites. Otherwise, there was no way the entire Purple Moon Army would’ve been deployed.

‘I’ll enter Wolf Fang City to gather more information first.’

He turned around to enter Wolf Fang City. Upon entering, he was subject to strict examinations and questioning. Moreover, the entire city was filled with a thick aura of killing intent. The streets weren’t bustling with people as they usually were, with the passersby all appearing hurried as they rushed to their destinations. Their faces were filled with worry and anxiety.

Ling Han stopped a Mountain River Tier passerby. He tossed him a True Origin Stone before asking, “What’s going on? Why is everyone so tense?”

The man caught the True Origin Stone and hurriedly put it away. He then respectfully said, “Sir, you’ve probably come from an outside city, right? You won’t believe this, the Netherworld has launched an all-out assault, and their army is being led by three Eternal River Tier generals. They advanced several thousand kilometers in a single day, and it’s only a matter of time before they arrive at the foot of Wolf Fang City!”

‘Three Eternal River Tier elites?’

Gasp!

‘No wonder the entire Purple Moon Army was deployed. It’s extremely likely that the two other legions have also been fully deployed. Otherwise, how can they withstand an army of 1,000,000 that’s led by three Eternal River Tier elites?

‘Is an all-out war about to erupt?’
