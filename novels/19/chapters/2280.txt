Chapter 2281: Another scroll

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

“You must possess some kind of precious treasure!” Richina set his eyes on Ling Han. “Otherwise, there is no way that a Sixth Lotus Five Leaves can match me!”

Ling Han shrugged, and retorted, “You are only amazed because of your ignorance.”

“You have obtained the treasure of an Ancestral King, right!” A covetous expression flashed across Richina’s face. Otherwise, an ancestral weapon that was presently enduring a heavenly tribulation and a youth that possessed battle prowess that surpassed ordinary standards were both illogical.

But the power of an Ancestral King was boundless. Who knew, they could allow a cultivator to possess battle prowess that was above average standards.

“All this… is mine!” Richina charged over. In the first place, the Angel Race and Demon Race could not be considered to be on friendly terms at all, so it was absolutely normal for conflicts and fights to break out between them.

Ling Han humphed lightly. His killing intent was also rippling. He moved decisively, harsh and ruthless.

As for keeping a low profile? He did not know the meaning of the concept at all.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them battled fiercely. If Ling Han could burst out with his full power, killing this opponent would naturally be completely effortless, but he could only channel Foreign Realm Regulations at present, so his battle prowess was restricted to Seventh Lotus Three Leaves, which was on equal terms

with Richina’s power.

‘Thus, though the two of them were fighting intensely, it was hard to decide the victor for the moment.

“Sacred light illuminates, favoring all realms!” Richina roared loudly, suddenly bursting out with a powerful move. Immediately, an endless power of Light surged out. It was as if the whole world had become a realm of light, bringing warmth and great comfort.

However, Richina charged out of this sacred light, wanting to take the chance to land a fatal blow.

Ling Han’s willpower was extremely firm. The attack could not cause the slightest bit of effect on him at all. He merely shot out a punch, bearing the aged air of Time.

He had used the Regulations of Time, causing Richina’s punch to become extraordinarily slow.

“Damn it!” Richina shouted loudly, bursting out with the Regulations of Light to the maximum. Instantly, the Regulations of Time were expelled, and his speed spiked in a flash.

‘The Regulations of Time were superior to other Regulations only when compared between equals, but Richina’s cultivation level was far above Ling Han’s. A full burst of the Regulations of Light from him naturally could contend with the Regulations of Time, yet also caused him to expend a lot of power.

He panted harshly, feeling that there was only less than half Spiritual Power left in his body. If this went on, he would be in danger of expending all power.

This was too frightening. A mere Sixth Lotus cultivator had actually worn out a Seventh Lotus cultivator completely?

He did not dare to attack rashly any longer, but rather chose to focus on defending, saving on power as he waited for the Divine Demon Sword to finish enduring the heavenly tribulation. As long as he could snatch this ancestral weapon, wouldn’t killing Ling Han be merely child’s play?

This was a viable strategy. No matter how freakish Ling Han was, there was still a major tier’s difference between them, so Ling Han could only restrain Richina, yet could not cause him any severe injury.

If this scene was witnessed by others, they would all defintiely be extremely stunned. This had definitely broken the ironclad rules of the cultivation world.

After about a day, the thunderclouds in the skies suddenly withdrew.

Weng, the Divine Demon Sword burst out with extraordinary light, more and more cracks appearing on the blade. Suddenly, it shattered, countless bits of metal falling down. Then, a new sword was seen, pointing straight at the skies, as if it was capable of easily ripping a hole into the dome of heaven.

‘The Divine Demon Sword’s upgrade was complete: it was now a Celestial Tool!

“Hahahaha!” Richina laughed loudly, and suddenly flew up, grabbing out at the Divine Demon Sword. “This is mine!” He had been waiting for precisely this moment, and this pounce from him was indeed faster than Ling Han could move.

Ling Han did not move to stop Richina, either, and allowed him to grab hold of the Divine Demon Sword.

“Surrender your life!” Richina brandished the sword in attack. Even if he could not activate the ancestral weapon, an ancestral weapon could crush all life merely in terms of sharpness—what could it not rip through with a single strike?

The blade approached, and together with Richina’s elegant demeanor, he was like a descending deity.

Ling Han merely smiled, and said, “Sword, come.”

Xiu, Richina only felt his right hand tremble, and the ancestral weapon actually flew out of his grip.

‘What?!’

He mouthed this word with an indescribable shock on his face.

This was an ancestral weapon. There was absolutely no way that it would recognize a Sixth Lotus cultivator as its master. Not even a Ninth Lotus would be recognized. Furthermore, without attaining the level of Ancestral King, one would not be able to activate an ancestral weapon. Thus, Richina was

extremely certain that he only had to grab the ancestral weapon, and that would spell victory for him.

He had never imagined that Ling Han could actually control the ancestral weapon. This was practically unbelievable.

He involuntarily shuddered. If the ancestral weapon showed its might, even if there were 100,000,000 of him, that would not be enough to handle an ancestral weapon.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “Don’t be nervous. This is not an ancestral weapon. It is just that the sword itself has reached the level of ancestral weapons.”

Celestial Tools and weapons that were forged from Divine Metal were completely two different things, but in ordinary circumstances, even Celestial Kings could only obtain Divine Metal with very great difficulty. Naturally, they were all forged into Celestial Tools. Actually, this was another concept.

Richina’s heart calmed slightly, but he still felt a terror that could not be described. Though this was not an ancestral weapon, it was the same in terms of sharpness. There was no need for a direct strike; merely a flash of Sword Qi would be extremely terrifying, and would be enough to rip him into pieces.

Finishing this thought, he suddenly turned and fled, no longer thinking of this ancestral weapon—at least for the moment.

Ling Han used Void Space, and rapidly pursued him. Laughing, he said, “We haven’t played enough, so why are you leaving in such a hurry?”

Richina did not answer, and merely ran swiftly, yet his speed could not be compared to Ling Han’s, and he was very quickly caught up with. A cold light shot towards him, causing all his hair to stand on ends.

He hurriedly turned around, and countered with a punch. Spiritual Power condensed into Regulations, turning into a divine fist of light that shot out at Ling Han.

He did not ask to wound his enemy, and only hoped that this blow could delay Ling Han for a while so he could have some time to flee.

Shua, the Sword Qi shot out from the Divine Demon Sword surged past, and that divine fist of light was immediately divided into two. The Sword Qi did not slow in the slightest, continuing to slice onwards.

With a pu, Richina was already slashed in two, and died a quick death.

Ling Han was also dumbfounded. It should be known that there was actually not much difference in strength between himself and Richina, but with just the addition of a sword, he now had the ability to insta-kill the latter.

But upon further thought, it was logical. If the Divine Demon Sword was really a Celestial Tool, then Ling Han would be able to easily kill even an Ascending Origin Tier, and though now the overall level of Regulations had not reached that level, it was forged from Divine Metal, after all. If it did not have

great might, what right would it have to claim the label of a Celestial Tool?

Ling Han shook his head, and walked over to rummage through Richina’s robes. Since the latter was already dead, there was no need for him to be reserved. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Huh?!”

Ling Han released a surprised exclamation. Richina naturally possessed a Spatial God Tool, but he actually hid a scroll on himself, and had not stowed it away into the Spatial God Tool.

At first, Ling Han thought that this was a decree, and wondered why that guy had not used it before. However, he soon discovered it was not, because he could not unfurl this scroll. Furthermore, he, too, could not store it away into the Black Tower or his own Spatial God Tool.

This.

Ling Han took out another scroll. He had obtained it from a den of mountain bandits after he had just entered into the Celestial Realm, Because he could not unfurl it or stow it away into the Black Tower, he thought that it was something amazing, and thus constantly kept it on himself. But in truth, this

thing was really completely useless.

And now, he had actually seen a second scroll in the Foreign Realm.

The fact that it had appeared in a den of mountain bandits, and was also found on a Seventh Lotus cultivator, seemed to imply that this thing was worthless, but it could not be stowed into even the Black Tower, so could it really be something ordinary?

“Strange, just what exactly is this thing?” Ling Han’s hands held a scroll each. In the past, he only had one useless item, yet now he had two. Fine, he was becoming a chicken’.
