Chapter 1944: Cheating

Ran Fei instantly understood Zhu Zijun’s intentions. He purposefully coughed, and he placed the alchemical pill back into the pill vial as he did so. During this process, however, he had already swapped the alchemical pill out for an ordinary Celestial pill. Meanwhile, he placed Ling Han’s alchemical pill into his own Spatial God Tool.

“Humph, this is nothing but a mere one-star alchemical pill. Moreover, it hasn’t even undergone Spirit Refinement. What a ridiculous joke,” he said in disdain. He waved his hand and tossed the pill vial back to Ling Han.

Ling Han caught the pill vial, and a cold smile tugged at the corners of his lips. Did they think he was blind?

They wanted to cheat him?

He pointed at Ran Fei, and said, “Don’t try such cheap tricks on me. Return my alchemical pill to me!”

Ran Fei glared at Ling Han, and asked, “What alchemical pill?” His brows furrowed, and he said, “Not only are you daring to impersonate a senior, but you’re even trying to smear my reputation! I’m a Two-Star Alchemist! Before me... you’re nothing but trash!”

Everyone was baffled upon hearing this exchange. Ling Han was accusing Ran Fei of swapping his alchemical pill out, while Ran Fei was denying this, and accusing Ling Han of defaming him. Which of them was lying?

“Humph, you actually dare to impersonate my grandfather’s junior brother. Just how audacious are you?” Zhu Zijun said as he strode toward Ling Han. His eyes were blazing with fury.

Zhu Feng was the pride of the Zhu Clan, and he was also the pillar of the Zhu Clan. He definitely couldn’t be slandered by others.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Obediently return my alchemical pill, and we can sort through these problems one by one. We’ll deal with the gamble first, and we’ll deal with my identity later.”

“Such wanton audaciousness! You’re trying to change the topic to buy time?” Zhu Zijun said in an ice-cold voice. “Kneel and apologize!”

On one side was a stranger with no background. On the other side was Grandmaster Zhu Feng’s grandson. Whom would everyone believe?

They naturally believed Zhu Zijun.

Thus, everyone shook their head in disappointment. They couldn’t help but think that Ling Han was extremely foolish. So be it if he impersonated Grandmaster Zhu Fen’s junior brother somewhere else. However, he had chosen to do so here. Moreover, he had been caught by Grandmaster Zhu Feng’s grandson and later-generation disciples.

“Capture him and hand him over to Grandmaster Zhu for punishment!”

“Does such a measly person have the right to see Grandmaster Zhu? Directly punish him with death!”

“In any case, capture him first!”

Many people started to shout for punishment. These were naturally the people who had wagered that Ling Han would lose. If he were captured and taken away, they would naturally win their wager.

Mo Shuang was enraged, and he shouted, “Do you people still speak any reason? The competition is about alchemy prowess! What are you people waffling on about?”

“This kind of dishonest person isn’t worthy of being called an alchemist!” Zhu Zijun said as he arrived before Ling Han. He then made a pressing motion with his palm.

Boom!

A boundless aura surged forth, transforming into a symbol of the great dao.

Zhu Zijun was a king tier at the peak stage of the fourth severance!

Guanhua City was brimming with talents, so Zhu Zijun couldn’t be regarded as a supreme prodigy. However, a king tier at the peak stage of the fourth severance was already no pushover.

How strong could a dishonest bumpkin be? Zhu Zijun could naturally capture him with ease.

Anyhow, he seriously wondered whether Mo Shuang’s and Han Tao’s IQ had been swallowed by a dog. They actually believed that this youth was Grandmaster Zhu Feng’s junior brother!

Ling Han casually reached over with his hand.

Pa!

Zhu Zijun’s wrist was firmly caught in his hand.

‘What?!’

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this. To casually block a fourth severance king tier’s strike... This person was definitely an emperor tier!

“For the sake of Third Senior Brother, I won’t lower myself to the same level as you,” Ling Han said. He then shook his hand and sent Zhu Zijun flying back.

Zhu Zijun arched his back and steadied himself. However, his face was filled with shock and disbelief. If Ling Han had wanted to hurt him just then, he could have definitely killed him in a single strike. However, Zhu Zijun didn’t feel a shred of gratitude. Instead, he felt even more humiliated.

Did he need to thank Ling Han?

He was Grandmaster Zhu Feng’s grandson, so who dared to hurt even a single hair of his?

Moreover, since Ling Han was an emperor tier, why was he still impersonating Zhu Feng’s junior brother?

This was far too detestable! Ling Han had purely come here to humiliate others!

“Who’s going to capture this detestable criminal for me?” Zhu Zijun said in a vicious voice. He looked around, only to see expressions of hesitation on everyone’s faces. No one responded to his call for help.

Those present were all king tiers or emperor tiers, so none of them would casually lower their own status to help him.

“One vial of Mundane Repairing Pills!” Zhu Zijun retrieved a vial of alchemical pills, and said, “I’ll gift this vial of Mundane Repairing Pills to whoever captures this detestable criminal for me!”

Countless people were tempted by this offer.

Mundane Repairing Pills could repair any imperfections that one had during their journey of severing the mundane. Of course, it couldn’t allow king tiers to become emperor tiers. However, it could allow low-level king tiers to become high-level king tiers, and it could allow low-level emperor tiers to become high-level emperor tiers. As such, these alchemical pills were extremely rare and valuable.

“Young Master Zhu!” Ran Fei and Shi Yong hurriedly exclaimed. Grandmaster Zhu Feng had especially refined these pills for his grandson, and these pills were more so at the Fifth Refinement. Thus, their value was far above that of ordinary Mundane Repairing Pills.

It was no exaggeration to say that they were worth as much as a city.

Was there any need to seek help from the onlookers? Both of them were elites at the yang soul, so could they not apprehend and capture a measly Severing Mundane Tier cultivator?

However, they weren’t aware that Zhu Zijun viewed himself as more of a cultivator. As such, did the mighty Zhu Clan need to dispatch cultivators of a higher tier to suppress a measly brat?

That would be far too humiliating!

That being the case, Zhu Zijun was willing to sacrifice a vial of Mundane Repairing Pills to capture Ling Han.

In any case, would it be difficult for him to obtain more Mundane Repairing Pills? He could simply ask his grandfather to refine more!

An emperor tier stepped forward, and said, “I’ll capture him!” Such a valuable reward was bound to attract a few brave cultivators. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mo Shuang and Han Tao involuntarily shook their heads upon seeing this. Only they knew that Ling Han wasn’t simply the junior brother of a Four-Star Alchemist. In addition to that, he was also a monarch tier in cultivation!

In reality, it was the latter identity that was more dazzling and impressive. This was because monarch tiers could definitely become Celestial Kings. However, Four-Star Alchemists could only somewhat rival First Heaven Celestial Kings. This gulf in status was quite significant.

Against a monarch tier, emperor tiers were generally not even worthy of a single strike. Not to mention, this was a battle between a fifth severance monarch tier and a fourth severance emperor tier. Ling Han possessed the advantage of an entire minor level.

Displeasure spread across Ling Han’s face, and he said, “You all like to pester me endlessly, am I right? Fine, then I’ll pummel you until you’re satisfied.”

“Before me, Hu Dong, do you have any right to act so audacious?” the emperor tier said with a sneer. He immediately reached over with a hand.

Boom!

The sky was filled with symbols of the great dao.

He was truly very powerful, and it was evident that he was already a top-notch emperor tier. With a single hand that could blot out heaven and earth, the emperor tier made a grabbing motion at Ling Han.

However, Ling Han simply replied with a casual snap of his fingers.

Pu!

A burst of vicious Sword Qi soared into the sky.

This was a comprehension that he had extracted from the Regulation of Slaughter and fused into his own sword techniques. Its destructive ability was astonishing, and it was powerful enough to slash the heavens and shatter the earth.

Pu!

The colossal hand was instantly sliced into two, with a petrifying murderous aura soaring into the sky.

Hu Dong’s expression changed drastically. Before he could even shout in alarm, he had already been sent flying by Ling Han’s strike. A streak of blood spurted into the air.

Thud!

He then heavily crashed into the ground, sending a plume of dust and smoke into the air.

‘What?!’

Everyone was stunned upon seeing this. A mighty emperor tier had been defeated in a single strike? Just how powerful was this person?

Perhaps he was a monarch tier?

Impossible! If he were a monarch tier, why did he need to impersonate Grandmaster Zhu Feng’s junior brother? Although this title was indeed astonishing, it was no more impressive than the title of monarch tier.

Perhaps he wasn’t a monarch tier, but just an emperor tier who had ventured even further?
