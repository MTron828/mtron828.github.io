Chapter 2355: Zhi Kong

“Have tea!” Zi Shuang said smilingly, lightly switching the topic from how Xue Ge had been hit.

Firstly, that was the common practice of the line of Desolate Eternity. If it was a grudge between two people of equal cultivation level, it would be settled on their own, and elites were forbidden from interfering. Secondly, she was more biased towards Ling Han as well. This was a man that she looked very highly upon.

Thus, Xue Ge could only wear a dark expression, and vent his anger on the tea. Gulping the tea down, his tea was soon finished, and he then demanded, “Where are the servants? Where is my tea!”

Zi Shuang clapped her hands, and a human immediately walked over, asking respectfully, “Miss Zi Shuang, what is your command?”

Though the body of his companion was just lying in front of him, he acted as if he had seen nothing.

Ling Han sighed internally. These people had long since become numb.

“Serve some tea,” Zi Shuang said. “And while you’re at it, dispose of the corpse.”

“Yes, Miss Zi Shuang.” That human nodded respectfully, and took away the body first. After a while, he returned bearing tea.

Xue Ge stretched out a hand, and was just about to drink from the teacup he had lifted when his face suffered another punch. Instantly, all the contents of his teacup was poured onto his face, and he jumped to his feet in fury. He shouted at Ling Han, “What exactly do you mean by this?”

“I just don’t like how you look. Is this reason sufficient?” Ling Han looked back at him, his eyes menacing.

Xue Ge very much wanted to fly into battle, but when he recalled Ling Han’s frightening battle prowess, he couldn’t help but suppress his fury, and began to drink his tea grumpily.

Zi Shuang looked at Ling Han in shock. In her eyes, Ling Han was a very flexible person, and should be very subtle, only doing things after much consideration. Why was he suddenly targeting Xue Ge for no reason?

She couldn’t help but hesitate internally, and decided that she would not form an alliance with Ling Han for now. What if this guy was a great troublemaker? She would then be drawing fire to herself, which would be truly unwise.

Thinking of this, she was no longer in the mood to entertain them, and thus had the servants bring them to rest at the guest courtyard to wait for the summons of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity.

Ling Han roamed casually on the mountain. As long as he did not descend the mountain, or fly too far away from the mountain, there would be no fog surrounding him.

In this place, he discovered a great many human slaves. The weakest was not even in the Shattering Void Tier, and the strongest had reached Ninth Lotus.

...They were all cultivating the celestial technique of the Foreign Realm. They could not sense the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm here, so it was natural that they were unable to cultivate Regulations, and could only switch to the cultivation system of the Foreign Realm.

Ling Han summoned a random person, and decided to make some queries.

“Gou Qi greets Young Master!” This human was a middle-aged man in his thirties, a Fifth Lotus blooming on his forehead. He was of medium build, and quickly sprinted over to Ling Han, appearing very ingratiating.

Gou Qi1?

Ling Han’s eyes flickered again. Even the names given to them were so low-grade and base, which showed how pitiful the status of humans was here.

“Don’t you have any other names?” Ling Han asked.

Gou Qi looked blank. What other name? Was there any need to have two names?

Though he was slightly confused, he still shook his head. “No.”

“For people like you, how many in total are there here?” Ling Han asked.

“Over 10,000 or so,” Gou Qi answered. Then, he immediately said very proudly, “I have passed through many levels of assessment, and finally became an A-grade slave. Hence, please believe me, Young Master. My service will definitely satisfy you.”

An involuntary grief rose up in Ling Han’s heart. The man actually gained a feeling of superiority from being a slave. It was clear that this was brainwashing that had carried on for generations.

“Do you know where your ancestors originate from?” Ling Han asked.

“I do. It is a place filled with sin, and every person there deserves to die. Lord Desolate Eternity has very kindly taken our ancestors here, so we must be slaves for many generations to redeem ourselves,” Gou Qi said with much fear.

Ling Han shook his head, and was in no mood to ask further. He waved his hand, dismissing the other party. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gou Qi was slightly fearful, and also felt slightly blank. Ling Han had summoned him over just to ask so many strange questions; was it because the former felt some displeasure about him? The pillar of support for his life was to be of service to the beings of the Foreign Realm. If this sacred mission was taken from him, his life would lose all meaning.

Ling Han walked some way further, and saw a stone statue ahead of him. This was an Insect Race member that had the form of a mantis. Who knew how long it had been here as it was covered with dust.

He couldn’t help but cast a second look at it, a strange feeling rising up in his heart. Vaguely, he could feel that there was something off, but no matter what, he could not figure out what was off about it.

“This is a living creature with Vitality Index as high as 10,000 points.” Wally’s voice suddenly rang out in Ling Han’s mind.

Ordinary communication through divine sense could possibly be intercepted by elites, but Wally’s communication definitely could not. According to him, he had used some kind of power that surpassed Regulations to further code it, and it was impossible that anyone could intercept the message.

Finally, Ling Han realized what was odd. As it turned out, this Insect Race statue was actually a living being, and was a supreme existence that had the battle prowess of a Fifteenth Lotus Ancestral King at that.

He stopped walking, and bowed to pay his respects to the stone statue, saying, “Greetings, Senior.”

This status trembled, its eyes slowly opening. Instantly, a frightening aura surged out, pressure descending like a mountain, as if even Divine Metal could not bear up against this pressure.

“Youth, your insight is not too bad!” A voice rang out from the statue, filled with a metallic trait. HIs figure trembled slightly, and dust fell off continuously, revealing his true self. He was completely golden, and actually did not have the disgusting vibe given off by the Insect Race.

“Merely Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf, and you can actually see through to my real self. Tsk!”

He appeared very curious. “Just how exactly have you managed to do so?”

“Naturally, it is because Senior is too captivating in bearing, which cannot be concealed at all.” Ling Han babbled complete nonsense. Naturally, he could not possibly reveal Wally’s existence.

This Insect Race laughed loudly, and did not proceed to interrogate Ling Han further. Everyone had their own secrets, and he naturally would not disdain to compel a minor character of merely Eighth Lotus.

“I am Zhi Kong, Master’s eighth disciple. Unfortunately, I have followed Master for several epochs, yet has still not managed to become an Eighteenth Lotus.” He shook his head, seeming very disappointed.

“This is the place of seclusion for Master. I am cultivating here, borrowing a sliver of Master’s Heavenly Venerable Tier aura, and perhaps may be able to break through to Sixteenth Lotus.”

Ling Han was surprised. Could it be that not all of Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s disciples were monarch stars? As long as they were monarch stars, and did not make any wrong turns on their path of cultivation, they would definitely be able to become Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral Kings in the future.

Zhi Kong laughed loudly. “Though there is no shortage of monarch stars among Master’s disciples, not all of them are monarch stars. Many years ago, Master has attempted to boost people whose aptitude is the most ordinary to the height of the Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King, and I had the fortune to be taken as Master’s disciple. Initially, even becoming a Ninth Lotus would’ve been difficult for me, but through Master’s teachings, I have now actually become a Fifteenth Lotus Ancestral King.

“Unfortunately, I have still disappointed exalted Master.”

Ling Han was internally stunned. The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity truly had astonishing ways and frightening foals. First, he wanted to make it so that every single person of the Foreign Realm would no longer have to fear being weakened by the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm, and now he wanted to turn a person with ordinary aptitude into an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King.

If he were to succeed, the overall strength of the Foreign Realm would reach a frightening level.

Thankfully, Zhi Kong was still a Fifteenth Lotus after cultivating for who knew how many years, and this was the result even with the dedicated guidance of a Heavenly Venerate. It lookedlike it was not very possible that this goal would be achieved.
