Chapter 573: Arrogance to Deference

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Business is about integrity. You guys bought those quotas and used them today; no refunds!”

“Bullsh!t!” Someone immediately jumped up. “A mere Flower Blossom Tier dares to have such nerve, you tired of living?”

“Hand over the Origin Crystals, and I can spare your life!”

“Youngster, don’t seek your own death because of some external possessions.”

Some threatened and some advised, but all of them wanted to take back the Origin Crystals from Ling Han.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “The Spirit Treasures Pavilion took away ten percent of the commission; do you guys dare demand it from them?”

“That’s your problem and has nothing to do with us!” those people immediately said.

No way; the Spirit Treasures Pavilion had Shattering Void elites keeping watch, so who would dare ask them for money?

“What if I don’t hand it over?” Ling Han said, smiling.

“That’s not up to you!” Everyone pressured him.

Being able to take out such a large sum of money, they were obviously the city’s noble families, with at least Spiritual Infant Tier elites keeping watch; Deity Transformation Tier oness wouldn’t be rare, either, and even Heaven Tier warriors might be found.

Now, it wasn’t the problem of 180 people, but also the families behind them. Such a force united was enough to sweep across the north region.

What could Ling Han use to block them? He couldn’t block it at all!

However, Ling Han was still full of smiles, absolutely unafraid, and said, “You guys threaten me like this... don’t regret it afterwards!”

“Haha, could you also set up something like the Fourth Killing Formation?” Everyone burst into laughter.

“Even if he could, don’t we still have a mighty Shattering Void Tier?”

“Boy, quickly return the Origin Crystals!”

“In addition, we need compensation for daring to deceive us. Hand over your arts and skills!”

“Yes, yes, yes, also your arts and skills!”

Everyone’s eyes lit up. Earlier, Ling Han’s display was extremely freakish; no matter the defensive ability, the movement art, or the attacks, it was all far surpassing that of a second layer Flower Blossom Tier...

Sh!t!

When did this boy become a fourth layer Flower Blossom Tier?

In a single night, he actually improved two small tiers; who could believe this!

However, everyone’s hearts immediately burned with desire again. This youngster had too many secrets, and if they could obtain them... it might be able to change a family’s prospects.

Everyone surrounded Ling Han, seething with killing intent.

Helian Xun Xue hurriedly swung the brick, and said, “You, don’t you guys act reckless. That person over there is Han Han’s older brother!” She was rather smart, learning to rely on someone else’s power.

As everyone heard her, they instantly burst into laughter.

Older brother? Older your sister!

How could a mere Flower Blossom Tier be the brother of an extremely strong Shattering Void Tier? The two were several hundred years old apart.

“If you don’t hand it over now, I’ll kill you!” some people said impatiently.

“Oh, you guys want to do what to my brother?” A voice sounded from afar.

Hearing this voice, most people immediately began to shiver. However, some people simply stared at Ling Han as they didn’t distinguish the voice, clamoring on. “Of course we’re forcing him to hand over Origin Crystals, arts, and skills!”

“Such great nerve!” Feng Po Yun already walked over, and the presence of the Shattering Void Tier rumbled. With each step, divine patterns blossomed profusely like celestial flowers.

Pa, pa, pa, everyone hurriedly knelt down.

Feng Po Yung walked to Ling Han’s side with a smile, and said, “Brother, someone trying to harm you?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, turned to look at the masses, and said, “My big brother is asking if you guys are trying to harm me?”

Everyone was on the verge of crying. This boy really became the brother of a Shattering Void Tier? If they’d known, they wouldn’t have dared to threaten Ling Han even with the greatest of guts. They hurriedly shook their heads one after another, and said, “We wouldn’t dare! We wouldn’t dare!”

“Then why did you guys just surround me and look seething with killing intent? Don’t you guys know that I’ve the smallest of guts and am easily scared?” Ling Han said intentionally.

‘You’ve the smallest of guts?’

Quite a few people mocked him inwardly, but didn’t dare to say it out loud, and hurriedly said, “We were thinking of gifting you Origin Crystals.”

“Yes, yes, yes, gifting Origin Crystals.” the other people hurriedly said. Everyone was smart; Ling Han didn’t crack down on their coercive actions and left them a way out in order to have them use money to save themselves.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Big Brother, they’re all good people!”

Feng Po Yun nodded, and said, “Good, then. I’ll break all the bones in the body of whoever dares to harm my younger brother.”

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts. This was a mighty Shattering Void Tier elite’s words, powerful and resonating; how could it simply be a reckless remark?

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Then send the Origin Crystals to the Spirit Treasures Pavilion, I live there. Big Brother, let’s go drink.”

“Alright!” Feng Po Yun nodded, and left side by side with Ling Han.

Heaven Tier elites didn’t speak up; even Yin Xue Yang and the others didn’t dare to interrupt, simply watching the two leave. Contrarily, Zhu Xuan Er, Helian Xun Xue, and Hu Niu chased behind.

Xuanyuan Zi Guang’s expression turned dark, and he clenched his fists tightly. He never would’ve thought that Ling Han would become sworn brothers with a Shattering Void Tier warrior; would he still dare to kill Ling Han?

What was so special about this boy that Feng Po Yun viewed him in a favorable light!?

...

Ling Han and Feng Po Yun came to Ling Han’s private quarters in the Spirit Treasures Pavilion. Taking out the ingredients inside the Black Tower and cooking them, the five people sat down and began eating.

Hu Niu feared nothing and no one, and Helian Xun Xue didn’t know about the tiers of martial arts, so only Zhu Xuan Er showed the proper respect, appearing extremely reserved.

This made Feng Po Yun quite interested as he said, “This little girl is remarkable!” He looked at Hu Niu and revealed an astounded expression.

Even a Shattering Void Tier elite said so.

“Niu’s the most impressive!” Hu Niu was not humble at all, and even reached out with her small arm and made a flexing pose.

Feng Po Yun laughed loudly, and said, “Younger Brother, you’ve got quite the luck with women, being surrounded by them!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhu Xuan Er immediately revealed a bashful look, but Helian Xun Xue was absolutely unaware, and simply fought over food with Hu Niu. She was strong, so Hu Niu absolutely couldn’t get the upper hand.

“Niu’s the most beautiful. Ling Han’s Niu’s!” Hu Niu clung onto Ling Han, and didn’t consider that her small hands were covered with oil.

Feng Po Yun was astonished; this little girl matured real early. He looked at Helian Xun Xue a few times, and said, “Younger Brother, the sea tribe’s waters are deep; you’d better be careful.”

Ling Han was astounded, and said, “Big Brother, you know of this Hai Niu’s identity?”

“Sea tribe’s royalty, the descendant of true dragons,” Feng Po Yun said casually.

Shattering Void Tier elites were Shattering Void Tier elites, after all; this couldn’t be concealed from him as expected.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “This chick has lost her memories.” He lowered his voice, and spoke about the ancient mineshaft, including the terrifying giant silver spider.

“Oh?” Feng Po Yun immediately revealed a curious look, and said, “Then I shall take a look.”

“Big Brother, be absolutely careful!” Ling Han had seen the great spider when it displayed its divine prowess; just the silhouette of it almost shattered his divine sense.
