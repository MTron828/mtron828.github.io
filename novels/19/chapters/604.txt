Can Ye attacked decisively, and with a swing of the saber, nine flashes of Saber Qi dispersed, the saber intent chilling; he was as if a god of war.

His progress was fast as expected, reaching nine flashes of Saber Qi, and only a step away from condensing a Ray.

Martial arts were not just about tiers. In the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, some only had one-star battle prowess, yet some could reach five stars, or even ten stars. Can Ye was only at the first layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, but his battle prowess reached seven stars!

This aspect was his personal talent, and the effect of Heavenly Luck Stone, allowing him to obtain additional five stars battle prowess.

As nine flashes of Saber Qi moved unhindered, Can Ye immediately tore open the four beautiful women’s encirclement and joined hands with Qin Yi Yue. Brandishing saber and sword together, they instantly suppressed the four beautiful women.

Originally, Qin Yi Yue already had a slight advantage, let alone now that there was Can Ye whose strength was not much inferior to hers.

“Hmph!” Inside the carriage, Hu Qing Fang’s extremely discontented snort could be heard. He said, “The brat with the severed arm, you dare ruin this young master’s fine occasion?”

Can Ye was not one to speak much to begin with; he simply swung the saber, completely defeating the four beautiful women.

Seeing such battle prowess, Chou Zi Fei and the others turned pale. They knew that Can Ye was strong, which was why they admitted him into their circle, but everyone was still quite conceited, thinking they themselves definitely weren’t inferior to him. Comparing it now, they were obviously shocked.

“Thank you!” Qin Yi Yue said. Amidst the battle, she couldn’t pay attention to courtesy, and simply nodded at Can Ye.

Can Ye was expressionless, extremely cold and detached.

Ling Han sighed—how can you pick up girls like that? She was showing her gratitude towards you, and if you were a bit gentler towards her, maybe you’d fall for each other! Wasn’t someone like him bound to be alone?

“Courting death!” A man, who looked little over twenty, darted out of the carriage. He was in embroidered clothes ornamented by jade and looked quite handsome, but the perverseness on his face was too strong; those eyes couldn’t wish more to strip down all of the clothing on women.

He was obviously Hu Qing Fang.

“Cripple, you dare ruin this young master’s fine matter? You truly are tired of living. See how this young master will put you down!”

Can Ye brandished his long saber, his gaze baleful as he said, “Then I’ll fight.”

Succinct and to the point.

He Lan Yun instantly revealed a besotted look. What she liked was precisely things like Can Ye’s icy cold and fearless personality, but Wind Moon Sect’s young master intervened, and losing or winning were both inappropriate, making her worry again.

“A mere first layer Flower Blossom Tier cripple even dares to be impudent in front of this young master!?” Hu Qing Fang sneered, and attacked Can Ye. The weapon he used was a spiked club covered with symbols; it was now activated, sparkling and emitting a terrifying presence.

Can Ye’s saber was still Nine Hoop Heaven Hero Blade, a fifth tier Spirit Tool, which couldn’t keep up with his tier anymore. But it couldn’t be helped; he was just a fifth tier martial artist who’d crossed into the Flower Blossom Tier not long ago, so how could he possibly obtain a sixth-tier Spirit Tool?

However, he was still fearless, brandishing the long saber with chilling saber intent and charging towards Hu Qing Fang.

Ping, ping, pang, pang , the two battled noisily. Hu Qing Fang was certainly strong. He was at the seventh layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, and his battle prowess reached ten stars, suppressing Can Ye by three stars. Moreover, the weapon in his hand was a sixth tier Spirit Tool, so he obviously had a great advantage.

However, Can Ye was extremely tenacious, and counterattacked repeatedly despite the disadvantageous situation, attacking to defend and fighting so desperately that Hu Qing Fang had to give up on attacks to defend—otherwise, both sides would be defeated and wounded.

For Hu Qing Fang, he was obviously unwilling to be defeated and wounded by Can Ye... firstly, his strength was higher, and secondly, with his identity, how could a “stray martial artist” compare with his noble body?

It was precisely such a qualm that rendered him unable to defeat Can Ye even in the situation where he clearly had the advantage, falling into a stalemate.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and opened up his hand secretly. An arrow of Origin Power condensed, xiu , firing at Hu Qing Fang. Now, no one noticed him, and he intentionally dissolved the color of this arrow that was condensed by Origin Power. Although its power decreased because of this, he didn’t want to take Hu Qing Fang’s life.

As the arrow swept by, Hu Qing Fang wasn’t on his guard at all, and was shot on the knee, instantly staggering and almost falling down.

Can Ye took the chance to strike with his saber, shua , bringing out a splash of blood.

“Ah!” Hu Qing Fang screamed. The saber struck on his shoulder and almost severed his bones, making him deeply pained. What made him even gloomier was that he actually hadn’t figured out the situation, and just felt his right leg go numb.

What happened?

Zhu Xuan Er and Hu Niu looked towards Ling Han. Others didn’t notice, because they didn’t care about Ling Han, a nobody at the Spiritual Ocean Tier, at all. They both smiled gently; as females, they obviously disliked people like Hu Qing Fang extremely.

However, Hu Qing Fang’s tier was higher after all, and his battle prowess was stronger. The saber wound wasn’t very heavy, either, and he soon pulled himself together, charging back at Can Ye.

Ling Han smiled inwardly. His right hand spread, and another Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow shot out.

His battle prowess now crossed into the Spiritual Infant Tier, and even if he didn’t use a physical bow, this Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow was still extremely formidable. In addition, he also adhered the power of lighting to it, and saw through Hu Qing Fang’s weak spots with the Eye of Truth.

Three Mystical Powers together... Hu Qin Fang should feel honored being hit by them. It was quite the rare occurrence, after all..

Hu Qing Fang staggered once more, and was struck by Can Ye’s saber again.

As other people saw it, it was as if Can Ye already anticipated he would make such an error, waiting there for him in advance. They couldn’t help but be shocked, since such control over a fight was too astounding.

With this “foresight,” Can Ye obviously took the upper hand with an extremely large advantage, striking at Hu Qing Fang to the point where he couldn’t endure it anymore.

After a few dozen moves, he ran into the carriage, and shouted, “Cripple, you dare go against me? You’ve got yourself into big trouble!”

Can Ye swept across his chest, and said, “Comt out to fight!”

There was no way Hu Qing Fang dared to come out. He thought that the sudden numbness in his legs was from some sort of mystic art that Can Ye used. He was already scared out of his wits; this brat didn’t care about his identity as Wind Moon Sect’s sect master’s son, and slashed fatally with each strike. If he fought him any longer, he would truly die here.

“If I don’t take my revenge, I won’t be able to live anymore!” he shouted, and with a call, the four beautiful women came back into the carriage one after another.

Can Ye still wanted to chase, but a light barrier rose up on the carriage, blocking him.

“Don’t chase. That’s Wind Moon Sect’s ancient war chariot, and if there’s an elite controlling it, it can even unleash Spiritual Infant Tier attacks.” Qin Yi Yue waved her hand to stop Can Ye, not letting him continue the chase.

Can Ye, however, looked towards Ling Han, and after seeing Ling Han shake his head too, Can Ye then stored his saber into a spatial ring.

“I’ll wait for you,” he said indifferently.

Hu Qing Fang roared angrily, but could only drive the carriage and run back the way he came.
