Chapter 1604

: Traitor

“Humph, we definitely cannot spare that damn brat!”

“Since the link of karma has appeared, it is proof that the despicable brat has returned to the Immortal Realm.”

“What brazen courage, he killed one of our Hu Clan, and actually dares to come strutting back.”

“We must not be careless. That despicable brat previously fled into the Netherworld, yet now returned. There must be something strange about it!”

As the Saints conversed, all of them determined that Ling Han had to be killed, or there would be no need for the Eight Stones Forbidden Land to exist any longer in future. Having two Saints die consecutively in the hands of a junior, they would be regarded with extreme disdain by the others.

However, Ling Han’s return was too illogical, which made them believe that this was possibly a trap.

Hu Luo hummed lowly. This vengeance definitely had to be executed, and Ling Han still had the rare treasures of the Heavenly River King in his possession—that was a Celestial King technique!

“Even if this is a trap, we cannot alert the other Forbidden Lands!” he quickly said. “I will conceal the twist of fate so that the other Forbidden Lands would not be able to make any prediction, and then I will personally hunt down that despicable brat!”

“Grand Elder, with Ouyang Taishan, that old geezer, stirring up trouble in secret, it is greatly possible that there are other Forbidden Lands involved to target us,” a Saint spoke up.

Hu Luo nodded, and said, “Second and Sixth, the two of you stay behind, and the others... all of you will go with me. Additionally, we’ll bring a few juniors with outstanding natural talent along with us. Since they want to sound me out, I will also do my own probing.”

If they turned out in full strength, and had their lair destroyed right behind their backs, they would be crying, but with five Saints, they did not believe that Ling Han would still be able to create any disturbance!

However capable Ouyang Taishan was, he was still a big shot of the Netherworld, and had limited influence in the Immortal Realm.

“For the sake of the rare treasure of the Heavenly River King, even if this is a trap, we will have to step in!” Hu Luo declared resolutely.

“En!” The other Saints nodded. If they obtained a Celestial King technique, the Hu Clan would skyrocket, and when they entered into the Celestial Realm in the future, it was even possible that they would become a top-tier Celestial King-level force.

It was worth the gamble!

With Hu Luo in the lead, there were a total of six Saints that rode their golden paths heading to Wood Figure Planet. The juniors naturally stayed inside a Spatial God Tool. However, because the distance was really too far, even they had to travel for a whole three months’ time to finally arrive at Wood Figure Planet.

Six Saints arrived, and two Saint Kings were among them. What kind of concept was that?

With their saintly might spreading out, all the living creatures of the entire Wood Figure Planet felt a tremble right from their hearts, as if their souls were about to be shattered.

“Greetings, Saint Kings!” The Star Sand Saint came out with his nine disciples in tow, paying a respectful greeting to Hu Luo.

Hu Luo was presently making a prediction, and also spreading out his divine sense in observation, but now matter how he looked, he could not find the slightest thing off—this planet was just like how it had been previously. The strongest elite here was only a Great Saint.

Strange, too strange.

He definitely did not believe that Ling Han would dare to strut back just like this. There was definitely something strange about this matter, and there had to be a conspiracy about.

Could it be that the force behind Ling Han was hiding in a Spatial God Tool?

He was really overthinking things.

However, no matter how wild his imagination was, how could he possibly think that there was something like the power boost from the Black Tower? He indeed could not understand how Ling Han could dare to come back alone. In his eyes, the quieter and more peaceful this place was, the more terrifying the killing intent here was!

Perhaps, there were a considerable number of Forbidden Lands targeting them, wanting to take the chance to get rid of the Eight Stones Forbidden Land.

Don’t think that just because they shared the name “Forbidden Land”, they were on the same side. Wrong, there were conflicts over power even within the same clan, what more among these top-tier forces. There were only so many valuable treasures like Saintly medicine, so how were they supposed to get these treasures if they did not snatch them from their rivals?

With conflicts of interest, there naturally would be enmity.

Furthermore, the Eight Stones Forbidden Land was accustomed to being aggressive, and had offended who knew how many different forces. It would not be strange for others to work together and gang up on them, though Hu Luo did not know exactly which Forbidden Lands were involved.

He suppressed the fury and killing intent in his heart, and said, “I have brought a few clansmen here today for a small spar with your disciples.”

The Star Sand Saint wore a strange expression; just what was he planning here?

‘Anyone can tell that your whole expression is blazing with killing intent, yet you actually did not show any inclination of murder and violence yet. Instead, you express the intention for a spar. Have you gone nuts?’

But a Saint King had already spoken, so who was allowed to refuse?

“All right, I will make the necessary arrangements.” He spoke in a low voice to the Nine Saints, and had them choose a few promising and outstanding disciples from their respective campuses.

They all relocated to the Ancient Academy, and sat at the spectators’ seats. The two Saint Kings naturally sat in the best positions, and the Star Sand Saint, as the host, sat in the seat next to theirs, followed by the other four Saints of the Hu Clan.

Not long after, the Tranquil Heart Saint and the other Nine Saints came with the big shots of their respective campuses in tow, though some disciples had come to watch the excitement when they heard about it. However, only three big shots of the eighth campus had come: Ren Feiyun, Qi Tian, and Yu Susu—Cai Miao no longer had any face to meet others.

Hu Luo did not even open his eyes. Under his divine sense, the whole Wood Figure Planet was under his control. He asked, “Where is Ling Han?”

The Star Sand Saint’s heart shook, and he looked towards the Tranquil Heart Saint, and asked, “Tranquil Heart, where is Ling Han?”

“In response to Master, Ling Han has ventured out on a training trip, and has yet to return,” the Tranquil Heart Saint lied through his teeth.

Hu Luo couldn’t help but humph in a low voice. The link of karma that he had grapsed had indeed snapped here, but it had not relocated to another place, so there was only one possibility—the other side had entered into a Spatial God Tool.

They wanted to deceive him?

“Milord!” Right at this moment, a middle-aged man shot through the air and arrived. There were fins on his back, and his fingers were webbed. He knelt on the ground, and exclaimed, “This junior is Cai Miao, and I have an important secret to report to you!”

“Insolence!” The several Saints from the Hu Clan glared. Who did he think he was? How could he meet with a Saint just as he willed?

Meanwhile, the Tranquil Heart Saint’s expression was as cold as ice, and he directly grabbed at him. “Ignorant of the rules, go back and cultivate in seclusion!”

Pa!

His hand had just stretched out when it was shattered directly by a tremendous force. Under the backlash of the impact, the Tranquil Heart Saint’s face looked like a golden paper, and he couldn’t help but open his mouth and spit out a mouthful of blood, but there were actually slivers of gold in his blood as well.

Hu Luo withdrew his finger, and calmly stated, “Let him speak.”

The Star Sand Saint’s fists tightened involuntarily. He treated his nine disciples like they were his own sons, and he wanted nothing more than to immediately make a move on Hu Luo, but if he dared to do that, every single person here would die!

He took a deep breath, and forcefully suppressed the impulse. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Speak,” Hu Luo said to Cai Miao, and even showed a sliver of a smile.

Cai Miao was greatly encouraged. He did not even look at the Tranquil Heart Saint, fearing that seeing the latter’s face would shake his resolve. After all, the latter was his master, and the accumulated prestige he had over him was heavy. The fact that he would appear at this moment was because he had firmed up his resolve to rebel and leave the academy.

After such a great humiliation, he no longer had any face to remain in the academy, and Ling Han was a thorn in his side that he was determined to remove. It just so happened that he had encountered visitors from the Hu Clan, so he naturally had to grasp this chance.

“Milord, that Ling Han has returned to the academy three months ago, and is presently in seclusion in his own courtyard,” he infomed.

This was naturally within Hu Luo’s expectations. At first, he was planning to flare up, and now with these words from Cai Miao, he directed a faint smile at the Star Sand Saint, and asked, “Have you deceived me?”

These words were spoken with a tone of blazing killing intent.
