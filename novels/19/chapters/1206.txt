Chapter 1207: Mastermind Finally Appears

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han spread his hands with a smile, and said, “To be honest with you, I’ve already handed the Thousand Source True Fluid to the Mo Clan Establishment to auction. So, you can all stop thinking about it now. If you don’t believe me, you can go out and ask around. Mm-hm, based on my understanding of you people, I trust that you already have people at the auction. In fact, it’s about time that they report back.

“Go on, keep interrogating me. Although the innocent will remain innocent no matter what, there’s always those who try to pour dirty water on others. I’m also extremely pissed off.”

Shen Kuo, Ma Gai, and the other judges all wore dark expressions. Did this brat really think that he was here as a guest? He was far too calm and composed! However, if what he said had been true, then they would really have been screwed over!

They looked toward Zhu Tianchou and Yu Si. Cold sweat instantly dripped down the two men’s foreheads. If Young Master failed to obtain the four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid, they would definitely have to shoulder a significant portion of the blame.

The faces became as white as a sheet when they thought of Gao Huang’s torture methods. It was as if they had become extremely sick.

“Han Lin, what gall you have!” Shen Kuo roared in anger. “The ownership of the Thousand Source True Fluid is still under dispute, yet you actually put it up for auction! Are you blatantly opposing the sect?”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Stop spewing such utter nonsense. The four drops of Thousand Source True Fluid are mine no matter how you want to paint the situation. If you don’t believe me, you can ask all of the Mountain River Tier cultivators in the sect to attack me. That way, you’ll see whether or not I’m able to defeat all of them by myself, no?

“Anyhow, your accusations are completely baseless. In fact, let’s talk about Shi Ming and the others. Since you’ve accused me of killing them, where are your witnesses and physical evidence? They couldn’t have told you in your dreams, right?”

Pu!

A few ordinary disciples who were maintaining the order outside the palace instantly spluttered with laughter. However, this wasn’t the public trial, so there was no one standing around and watching. Thus, these disciples barely had anything to do.

Shen Kuo’s expression became extremely dark.

He had never dreamed that a day would come when he would almost explode in anger due to the words of a Mountain River Tier cultivator.

After all, it was almost impossible for such a situation to occur. Which Mountain River Tier cultivator dared to speak back to Sun Moon Tier elites? Moreover, what did matter if they spoke back? If they did, the Sun Moon Tier elites could simply smack them to death. What could the Mountain River Tier cultivators do about this?

However, he truly couldn’t smack Ling Han to death at this moment.

First of all, he couldn’t confirm whether the Thousand Source True Fluid had truly been handed to the Mo Clan Establishment to auction. If he smacked Ling Han to death, and it turned out that he was hiding it somewhere... he could sit tight and wait for Gao Huang to kill him.

Second of all, Ling Han was still a seed. As long as he retained this status, it would be beyond his authority to kill him.

Thus, Shen Kuo could only suppress his anger.

Peng!

The door of the White Jade Palace was suddenly pushed open at this moment—in fact, it was probably kicked open. The person at the door was still in a kicking posture.

This was a slender youth who appeared extremely handsome. However, a terrifying aura radiated from his body, and the pressure that it exuded caused many of the people present to have difficulty breathing. It was as if they were being choked.

“Our respects to Young Master!” Shen Kuo and the others immediately stood up and bowed respectfully to the youth. Meanwhile, the Mountain River Tier disciples instantly kneeled down in greeting.

This person... was Gao Huang!

Ling Han turned around to look at this opponent he had never seen before. He needed to remember this person’s appearance lest he accidentally killed the wrong person in the future.

Gao Huang wore an angry expression as he strode into the hall. He humphed coldly, and said, “What are you trash even doing? I received a report that a drop of Thousand Source True Fluid has already been auctioned!”

The appearance of this drop meant that the remaining three drops were also in the hands of the Mo Clan Establishment.

Shen Kuo and the others remained silent, just like cicadas in the cold. Although they were Sun Moon Tier elites, they were like little children before Gao Huang. There was nothing they could do about this. Gao Huang wasn’t weaker than them, and his status was far above theirs. Moreover, his father was an elite at the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier. Who would dare to provoke him?

In any case, they were all members of the Gao Faction, so how would they dare to disrespect their young master?

Gao Huang turned his gaze to Ling Han, and said, “You! Immediately head to the auction house and stop the auction!”

“Oh? Why should I?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

“Because I command you to do so!” Gao Huang said haughtily.

“Dumb c*nt!” Ling Han snorted.

“Y-you dare to scold me?!” Gao Huang shouted in fury.

Ling Han shrugged his shoulders, and said, “If you’re not a dumb c*nt, why did assume I was talking about you? If you are a dumb c*nt, then I’m merely telling the truth. If telling the truth is equivalent to scolding, then I’ve really got nothing to say.”

Gao Huang instantly exploded in rage. He had never seen someone curse another person so “righteously” before. He humphed, and said, “You’re acting so arrogant even though you’re in an interrogation hall. What a rare sight! However, don’t forget where this is!

“Hmm? What are you all standing there for? Continue the interrogation!”

Shen Kuo and the others all looked at each other. Hadn’t they been interrogating Ling Han before? It was the sudden arrival of Gao Huang that had interrupted the trial. Yet, Gao Huang was actually blaming them?

However, did they dare to grumble in complaint?

They weren’t Ling Han, nor were they as courageous as him.

“Han Lin, no matter how many excuses you come up with, you won’t be able to escape the chains of justice!” Shen Kuo returned to his seat before slamming the table, and saying, “Invite the witnesses!”

It wasn’t long before several people walked out from the back of the hall. They were all youthful disciples at the Mountain River Tier.

“Did you witness Han Lin killing Shi Ming and the others?” Shen Kuo asked.

“We did, Senior!” the Mountain River Tier disciples said, nodding respectfully.

Shen Kuo turned to Ling Han, and asked, “Han Lin, do you have anything to say?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, then pointed at one of the youths, and said, “Let me ask you, what technique and weapon did I use to kill Shi Ming?”

“Er...” The youth was rendered speechless. They hadn’t prepared an answer to this.

“What? You witnessed me killing them, yet you have no idea how I killed them?” Ling Han smiled, and said, “Is there something wrong with your eyes?

“Hold it! Don’t answer my question yet!”

Ling Han waved his hand at the youth, then turned to the other disciples, and said, “Since you all witnessed me killing Shi Ming, tell me together, what weapon did I use to kill him? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“There’s no need to hurry. I’ll count to three, and you can all answer together.

“One.

“Two.”

“Enough!” Shen Kuo roared. “Han Lin, how long are you going to muck around for?”

Ling Han was astonished, and he said, “Am I not proving my own innocence? Anyhow, this is a very simple question, is it not? Since they witnessed me killing them, isn’t it well within my rights to ask them what technique and weapon I used?”

“Humph! You’re threatening the witnesses!” Shen Kuo said sharply.

“Heh, how would I dare to threaten the witnesses before Sun Moon Tier judges? I don’t have the power to do that even if I wanted to!” Ling Han’s voice was calm, and he continued, “Then I may as well remain silent. Will that satisfy you, Seniors?”

“Heh, what an argumentative person!” There was a long laugh, and a person appeared before the door of the palace.

No, there were two people, one in front and one behind.

The person standing in front was a handsome youth—he was no less handsome than Gao Huang. Moreover, his strength was likely no weaker, either. The aura that radiated from him was also suffocating.

Ling Han didn’t recognize this person. However, he immediately guessed his identity upon seeing that the person behind him was Ji Yunzhi.

He was Hua Yangwen, the young master of the Hua Faction.
