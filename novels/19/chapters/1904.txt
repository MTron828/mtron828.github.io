Chapter 1905: Exit

Ling Han was the type that would be more motivated the more pressure he was under.

Only the last alchemical pill was left.

He instead broke out into a smile, a completely calm expression appearing on his face. As his hands moved, he began.

Outside, aside from Ling Han, the other nine people had all completed their pill concoction and Spirit Refinement, and there was only a slight bit of time left before the deadline of one day. However, in the alchemy chamber, because of the effects of time acceleration, it was enough to allow Ling Han to complete two times of Spirit Refinement.

Everyone’s eyes were drawn over.

‘Just playing up the show!’ Lu Xianming’s expression was filled with disdain. Ling Han’s first two times of Spirit Refinement were only limited to First Refinement, and then he had thrown the alchemical pill away. What did this mean?

It had to be that he could only accomplish First Refinement, and that was why he had deliberately thrown them away to conceal the fact that his abilities were inadequate.

Right. This guy had merely used four to five years’ time to accomplish First Refinement, and this was extremely amazing, but the problem here was that the starting point of the test was Two-Star alchemical pill and Second Refinement. Then, no matter how perfect your First Refinement was, or how little time you had spent on alchemy, so what?

This was also the reason why Lu Jin wanted to make an agreement of three years with Alchemist Zi Cheng. That was because no matter how freakishly prodigious Ling Han was, he could not possibly attain Second Refinement in such a short amount of time.

Even Alchemist Zi Cheng was slightly nervous. Ling Han really did not have the slightest way out now. He would have to succeed or die trying.

The more he cared, the more worried he was. If it was he himself that was concocting an alchemical pill, he would instead be more confident, but now he was so nervous that there was sweat on the palms of his hands.

This little disciple was really capable of making things exciting.

First Refinement complete!

A smile spread across Ling Han’s face. In the recent half a year, he had been increasing his skill at First Refinement gradually to a perfect level. Furthermore, it was established on his own method. This was astonishing as it meant that it was possible that he could create a system of Spirit Refinement that was solely his.

At first, there were still some minor flaws, but after the last few imperfect Spirit Refinements. and under massive pressure, he had successfully completed the promotion.

First Refinement, perfect!

‘Let’s begin Second Refinement.’

Ling Han flicked his hand, and the Celestial pill immediately danced. Multiple flashes of fire flew out from his palm, turning into many strings that interwove together behind the Celestial pill like a spider’s web.

Ling Han was extremely focused. He had forgotten that this was a test, and was only purely refining this alchemical pill.

Ethereal, natural, and close to great dao.

After they saw this scene, a great many alchemists were moved with shock. This kind of state was extremely hard to come by, and could enable the alchemical pill produced to reach a higher level than usual, as if the heaven and earth itself was providing aid. In that case, great dao would naturally be extracted easily, interweaving and resonating with the medicinal effects.

Gods, in such a heavily pressured atmosphere like a test, this brat was actually still capable of entering into an ethereal state?

‘F*ck!’

They really didn’t know whether to say this brat had zero interest in fame and profit, or was born just for alchemy. This was really f*******.

The expressions of Lu Xianming and the others changed drastically. Ling Han could actually accomplish Second Refinement.

This was the Second Refinement. That was no joke.

How could that be?

Merely three years had passed, and it might be that he had not attained even First Refinement, so how could he do Second Refinement?

But facts spoke louder than words. They were rendered completely speechless.

They only hoped... that the grade of the alchemical pill that Ling Han had concocted was not too high, and the standard of his Second Refinement was not much, either.

“I think, just based on the fact that Holy Son Ling could enter into an ethereal state under such conditions, he is worthy of becoming the chairperson of Alchemy City!” someone suddenly spoke up.

“That’s right. This is really too rare.” A considerable number of others expressed their agreement.

“That is inappropriate!” Naturally, there would be others raising an objection. “A test is a test. What could be accomplished without rules?”

“That’s right. Don’t tell me that he would not be able to shine in Alchemy City without becoming chairperson?” This opinion also gained the support of quite a number of people.

The people on both sides broke into an argument. Though neither side could convince the other for the moment, it still caused Lu Xianming and the others to pale in shock.

There had never been a case like this. The test had not ended, and about half the number already had someone that they supported. It should be known that there was still Alchemist Zi Cheng behind Ling Han, and he only had to say something at this point to support Ling Han, and then that definitely was enough to make the final decision.

Fortunately, Alchemist Zi Cheng was expressionless all this while, and did not say anything.

He was filled with confidence in Ling Han, and was completely disdainful of using this kind of little tricks.

Of course, if Ling Han really failed in his Spirit Refinement, he would not mind using his influence to change the views of some people.

Don’t tell him that the strength of the disciple that he had taught still had to be doubted?

Inside the alchemy chamber, a day’s time passed quietly. Ling Han stretched out his hand and grabbed. Boom, the Nine Heavens Flame surged, wrapping around the Celestial pill. The flames were ferocious, as if they were about to turn the Celestial pill into ash.

Right at this moment, Ling Han suddenly moved again, and Xuanyin Source Water was channeled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Fire and water were incompatible, and the might of the Nine Heavens Flame was immediately restrained.

With ice and fire on either side, the interweaving of extreme cold and extreme heat could create an amazing change. This was Ling Han’s understanding of alchemy and pharmacology.

Boom, the ice and fire surged, and then peace was restored.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled in a frown. He felt a kind of urge to destroy this alchemical pill.

It was actually just a little bit away from being absolutely perfect!

He had at first thought both times of Spirit Refinement could be perfect, which made him feel that it was a great pity, and he wanted nothing more than to begin concocting another cauldron.

He failed? Lu Xianming and the others thought.

No, no, no, no. If he had failed, the alchemical pill would have been destroyed. This was Spirit Refinement! It had to be that the quality of Spirit Refinement was not good enough, and that was why he had such a sour expression.

The other nine Holy Sons and Holy Daughter slightly steadied their emotions. The failure this time had to be capable of dealing a heavy blow to Ling Han’s popularity.

Subsequently, Ling Han also pushed open the doors and exited. Alchemist Zi Cheng opened his mouth, and said, “Since everyone is done, we will begin assessing the grade of the alchemical pills.” He paused, and then called out a few names. “Luo Ying, Zi Gong, Gong Tian... the 10 of you are in charge of the examination.”

“Yes!” 10 alchemists walked out, and they were all Three-Star Alchemists.

After gradually assigning pills, they stood in front of a Holy Son or Holy Daughter each, and then began their examination together.

The time for pill concoction was very long, but examination would only need a short while, what more when these 10 people were all Three-Star Alchemists! But there were serious implications involved in the selection of the future chairperson of Alchemy City, so they repeatedly examined a few times over before coming to a final conclusion.

“Report the results according to the order in which they came out,” Grandmaster Zi Cheng said calmly.

“Holy Son Ou Kan has concocted a Blue Peak Spirit Transformation Pill. Among Two-Star alchemical pills, the difficulty level is medium, and the grade of the completed pill is High Grade, First Refinement is perfect, and the Second Refinement is ordinary,” a Three-Star Alchemist immediately reported.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng nodded, and said, “Then we’ll use this result as the basis, and determine it as 10 marks, to be subtracted or added for subsequent grading.”

“Agreed!” All the alchemists nodded. Since there was comparison to be done, there definitely had to be material for reference.

“Holy Son Lu Xianming has concocted the Jade Bone Pill. Among Two-Star alchemical pills, the difficulty level is below average. The grade of the completed pill is Medium Grade. First Refinement is perfect, and Second Refinement is also perfect,” the second alchemist announced.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng paused slightly, and said, “The difficulty level and the grade of the completed pill are both a bit low, but the two times of Spirit Refinement are both perfect. Furthermore, Lu Xianming has stepped into the path of alchemy for but 200 million years, which is extra credit, and the final mark is... 11 marks. Any objections?”

Ou Kan’s expression paled abruptly. He had not thought he would have lost so quickly!

“Agreed!” All the alchemists nodded. Alchemist Zi Cheng did not deliberately suppress Lu Xianming just because he was Lu Jin’s disciple. He really was a person of noble character and unquestionable integrity.

Yet Ling Han snickered internally. What noble character and unquestionable integrity did this master of his have? He was just certain that Ling Han would win, and had thus deliberately done this. Since he could win himself some popularity, why not?

Wily fox, oh, no, very astute and deep foresight.
