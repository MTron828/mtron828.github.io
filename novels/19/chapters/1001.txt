Chapter 1002: Beaten until Bursting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Die! Die! Die!” As Hu Qiwei moved continuously, he continued to open his mouth to roar. Sound waves blasted out one after another, and they all formed into human figures, brandishing staffs in attack towards Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. One staff strike followed after another. Though they could not damage Ling Han, it was still an attack of an elite in the high extreme in the end. Hence, Ling Han was stopped from advancing further, and he could not get near Hu Qiwei.

“Hahahaha, young man, your good background only allowed your foundations to surpass others, but fighting would still have to depend on experience!” Hu Qiwei exclaimed, laughing loudly. “I have battled all the way until today, and it has already been 210,000 years. How could you compare with me?”

Ling Han could not help but stare. To a person that had come from a small world, who was used to the limits of a normal lifespan, even a Shattering Void Tier cultivator would only be able to live around 1,000 years or so. Even if he himself had already leaped into the medium extreme, he had still not placed himself on that same level.

... His maximum lifespan had already reached 200,000 years. From this aspect, his relative age was really frighteningly young.

He smiled faintly, and asked, “Is that right?”

“Just wait until I shatter that handsome face of yours, and we’ll see if you can still smile like this!” Hu Qiwei inhaled a mouthful, and then suddenly roared loudly. Weng , this time, the human figure made of sound waves that appeared was at least three times bigger than before, and was wielding a sharp sword.

The sound wave human surged over, and brandished his sword in a stab aimed directly at Ling Han’s face.

Ling Han humphed, stretched out his right hand, and weng , the divine patterns of gravity were activated with a soft press. This figure formed of sound waves instantly dropped, its movements completely distorted. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Peng!

This sword from the sound wave human directly sliced into the ground, instantly cutting a massive hole in the wooden floor. Dust filled the air, causing a great many people to wave their hands to stop the intrusion of dust into their space.

However, there were still a few people that were seated motionlessly. When the dust floated in their direction, it was stopped by an endless barrier, and could not go any further.

Those people looked ordinary, but if one took a closer look, they would realize that a frightening aura was hidden in their bodies. The moment it exploded, they could easily crush any Mountain River Tier cultivator to dust.

They were all elites of the Sun Moon Tier.

“What!?” Hu Qiwei was shocked. That attack just now was one of his most powerful, yet was easily dispersed just with Ling Han raising his hand. This was unacceptable to him.

Ling Han kept up the attack, and delivered a punch.

“Humph!” Though Hu Qiwei was stunned, he would not stand there and wait to be killed. He hurriedly retreated, and opened his mouth to shoot out another sound attack.

However, now that Ling Han had gotten serious, what threat could these sound waves pose to him?

The divine patterns of gravity activated, and these sound waves were all compressed, or even shattered completely. It should be known that a Mountain River Stone with a special attribute was extremely valuable, and the difficulty of obtaining one was very high, so how could their power be something ordinary?

Ling Han once again used the divine patterns of gravity to affect Hu Qiwei’s movement technique, and instantly narrowed the distance between the two of them, his fist heavily crashing down.

Hu Qiwei stretched out his arms to parry, but with the effect of gravity, his actions were still a little too slow. Ling Han’s fist forcefully invaded his defenses, and fell heavily on his face. Immediately, the muscles on his face rolled out in multiple waves, and then split apart with a pa .

He was sent flying, and just when he was about to collide with a pillar, a person jumped up and stretched out a hand to catch him. Otherwise, if the pillar broke due to the impact from the collision, this building could possibly collapse.

When everyone looked once more at Hu Qiwei, they couldn’t help but be stunned. Half of his face had been reduced to nothing, and they could clearly see broken bones and torn flesh, which made for a very bloody scene.

“Enough. If the battle continues, it will really result in death.” The one that had caught Hu Qiwei was an old man with a white beard. Previously, no one had paid him any attention, yet he had appeared so suddenly just like this.

He was an elite of the Sun Moon Tier, and at this moment, his aura was fully on display. Behind him, there was a complete set of Sun and Moon, showing that he was at the peak stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

“Elder Qian!”

“Greetings, Elder Qian!”

A considerable number paid their respects. This old man had the surname of Qian, and his given name was Yi. He was an elder of the Great Chariot Gang. Even though he looked peaceful and kind, he was well known for his violent and cruel ways. The number that died in his hands was uncountable.

Ling Han did not use the opportunity to pursue the matter further. He was only trying to make his position clear to stop others from slandering and tossing obscenities at Shui Yanyu. He nodded slightly at Qian Yi, then walked to the counter, and said, “We would like accommodations.”

“One room or two?” the innkeeper asked.

“One.”

“Two!”

The former reply was from Ling Han, but Shui Yanyu hurriedly corrected him.

“One!” Ling Han placed his arm around Shui Yanyu, causing her body to soften, and the rebuttal she was just about to say became a pair of dazed eyes, electrifying enough to melt anyone’s heart.

“The accommodations here cost a True Origin Stone per day. While you are in our inn, we guarantee your safety. Of course, if you yourself want to fight with others, that is a different story. Please first pay for 10 days in advance. If you do not stay for the full duration, we will not be refunding the remaining amount. 10 days later, if you still want to continue staying here, then you will have to pay another 10 True Origin Stones,” the innkeeper said.

How black-hearted!

The ships here left once every three days, and most people would only stay for two to three days. But in this place, they would have to pay the rent every 10 days, and there was no refund, either.

Ling Han drew out 10 True Origin Stones and handed them over. This was only a paltry sum to him, and he really did not care much for it.

“Master, I’ll lead the way!” one of the workers said from the sidelines.

He led Ling Han and Shui Yanyu up the stairs. There was a total of five floors, and they went to the fourth.

The room could definitely not be considered lavish or luxurious at all, but the purpose of staying in an inn was for the sake of safety. Those that stayed here obtained the protection of the Great Chariot Gang. Unless the Yang Clan came to ask for them personally, this place was absolutely safe.

“Do the two of you plan to rest first, or come downstairs for a meal?” the waiter asked.

“Rest.”

“All right. Then, I shall not disturb the both of you.” The waiter retreated outside, and closed the doors behind him.

Immediately, only the two of them were left inside the room. When Shui Yanyu saw Ling Han approach, she hurriedly went on her guard, and said, “Don’t you mess around!”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “****, what thoughts are your head filled with?” He switched to using his divine sense to send a message, and said, “Didn’t you know that I have a Spatial God Tool? I’ll bring you in now to take a look.”

Shui Yanyu immediately looked moved. That was a Spatial God Tool, a divine object that only existed in legends. Even the empress herself could not possibly possess one!

“Don’t resist my divine sense!” Ling Han said.

“En... wu!” Shui Yanyu had just nodded, but who would have thought that Ling Han would suddenly kiss her, and her response instantly became wu, wu sounds. She quickly stretched out her hands to push him away, yet her hands became gradually weaker as she lost herself in Ling Han’s passionate kiss.

She was kissed to complete distraction, so she naturally did not guard her spirit. With that, Ling Han easily took her into the Black Tower.

She did not realize it at first. A long while after Ling Han lifted his mouth, she finally came back to her senses, and said in annoyance, “You damn pervert, you’re again acting shameless—” She had not even finished her words when she was dumbstruck with shock, stunned by the scene before her eyes.
