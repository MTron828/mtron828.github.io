Chapter 241: Demonic Qi

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Finally, no more corpses continued to drop down from the skies. However, these corpses all stood up and began to surround Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan.

They did not make any move, and seemed to be waiting for a command from someone.

However, though Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan were heavily surrounded, neither looked the slightest bit afraid. That was because they both had a powerful life-saving trump card—Ling Han had the Black Tower, while Rong Huan Xuan had his Three Live Corpse Caskets.

All of a sudden, these corpses all turned to look at Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan. There appeared a network of black-colored veins on their skin, which caused them to look strange in an instant, but at the same time, it also gave them a bit of life, as if they had really been revived.

They began to walk and made their way towards Ling Han and Rong Huan Xuan. They didn’t move very quickly, but each and every one of them was exuding a powerful aura.

These people were indeed dead, and because they had not been refined, could not possibly have the powerful battle prowess that Corpse Soldiers had. However, those patterns on their skin had completely changed everything, and allowed them to possess a terrifying battle prowess.

It was as if… they had been transformed into human-shaped Spirit Tools! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Rong Huan Xuan, we shall continue our battle next time!” Ling Han laughed, drew out a Swift Cloud Talisman and slapped it onto his body. Then, he broke into a run.

There was no advantage at all in fighting with these human-shaped Spirit Tools. Moreover, both he and Rong Huan Xuan had a means which could absolutely guarantee their safety and so were unable to kill the other off, so what was the point of continuing to fight? To continue wasting time here? Moreover, those corpses must have appeared to block their advance, and anyone who would choose to continue to stay here and fight a tough battle would be an idiot.

Hong , a female corpse raised her hand and delivered a palm strike. A light shadow was launched, and formed into a network of patterns, shooting towards Ling Han.

A Spiritual Pedestal Tier level attack!

It was not possible for Ling Han to dodge an attack of this level even if he had increased his speed tenfold. But just as this light shadow was about to make contact with him, he entered into the Black Tower in a flash, but in the next instant, once again reappeared from within the Black Tower.

As his speed was too fast, it was as if he had never disappeared at all, but that attack had indeed missed its target.

“Yi!” Rong Huan Xuan was extremely shocked, because he was quite sure that he himself would never have been able to dodge that attack. It was after all an attack from someone in Spiritual Pedestal Tier! If his eyes had been sharper, he may have discovered the fact that Ling Han had vanished and once again reappeared, but for someone in the Gushing Spring Tier, that was impossible!

Ling Han’s calculations were too accurate. Entering and subsequently exiting the Black Tower was just enough to make that attack fall short of its target. If he had reappeared a bit sooner, he would definitely have suffered the attack, and if he had appeared a bit later, then it would have exposed him.

…How could the eyes and judgement for someone who used to be in Heaven Tier be hollow?

However, he did not have the time to continue pondering, as there were already many corpses that had launched their own attacks at him. The Silver-Armored Corpse had just rushed forwards, and with a pa , smacked an old corpse into pieces.

An existence of Flower Blossoming Tier!

Rong Huan Xuan did not have the slightest feeling of having vented his anger as he hurriedly hid himself in one of the caskets.

Peng, peng, peng, peng . An innumerable number of attacks shot forwards, activating the Three Live Corpse Coffins. The patterns on the coffins immediately lit up, launching rays of black light. Even if these corpses had the battle prowess of Spiritual Pedestal Tier, at the very least, they did not have the slightest bit of resistance against these rays of black light. In an instant, they collapsed and transformed into a black-colored liquid.

In this way, the attention of practically all the corpses was attracted. With a long hiss, Ling Han’s speed increased, and he had instantly disappeared into the distance. Meanwhile, Rong Huan Xuan could only curse from within the copper coffin. The best case scenario was that Ling Han would be killed off by one of the corpses.

Those corpses were very powerful, but speed was not their forte. After Ling Han had forced his way out of the encirclement, he very quickly managed to throw off his pursuers, and continued to make his way to that black-colored pillar of light ahead of him.

He had the logbook left behind by Xiao Ding, and managed to continuously avoid all the dangerous zones. But after advancing a bit further, he had reached the zone that had been Xiao Ding’s limit. In other words, he would be able to come into contact with that source of misfortune here.

Ling Han used his divine sense to continuously sweep over himself, taking note of any slightest bit of change. However, his bloodstream, his heartbeat, and everything else was completely normal.

He was approaching closer and closer to that black-colored light pillar, and sensed that he would be soon unravelling an ancient mystery, so could not help becoming a little bit excited.

After proceeding for some more distance, he coincidentally raised his hand, but realized, much to his shock, that there had actually appeared a black-colored pattern on his palm and arm, which was exactly the same as those corpses that had dropped down from the sky.

How could this be!?

He had obviously not felt any change, but without his knowledge, something had happened to his body, making him feel very astonished and wary.

One had to understand, he was someone who had the senses of a martial artist in Heaven Tier. Yet still, he had fallen victim without realizing it.

Xiao Ding had said in his logbook that there was a mysterious energy in this place, which had infected him, causing him to feel unlike himself. Then, if he had been like those corpses that had fallen down from the sky, then began to move under the control of this mysterious pattern, he would have been moving like a zombie, and indeed, that was no longer himself.

With a thought, Ling Han had entered into the Black Tower.

In the Black Tower, he was the ultimate ruler. He left Liu Yu Tong and the other girls far behind, and did not allow them to find out that he had arrived.

“Get out!” Ling Han humphed. A mighty force exploded from his body, and it was as if he had transformed into a brilliantly shining sun. Those patterns on his skin were instantly shattered, and transformed into black-colored threads. After they merged together, they only had the breadth of a single strand of hair.

It was as if this black thread had a life of its own as it continued to twist around, and even released shrill hisses.

It was the level of divine sense, and directly penetrated into one’s mind.

“I am in charge in my territory. Whatever you are, you had better behave in front of me!” Ling Han’s right hand pressed down on empty air, and this black thread could only obediently hang in midair.

Xiu , Small Tower appeared, slightly trembling.

“Do you know what this thing is?” Ling Han asked.

“Demonic Qi. There is a consciousness in it, which allows it to control living beings and transform them into puppets,” Small Tower answered.

Ling Han nodded. He had seen with his own eyes that there were similar patterns flashing on the bodies of those corpses, and they were moving around like zombies. Ultimately, it was this black thread that was the key of the matter.

“However, pure Demonic Qi is also not a bad energy, which can be used to remold yourself thoroughly. I can erase the consciousness from within it, and make it so that you can use it. However, there is not much here, so the effects would be limited.” Small Tower continued.

“Really?”

Small Tower shook lightly. “It’s done.”

It was done just like that? No matter how it was, shouldn’t there have been some explosion of light, or a bit of time to wait?

Ling Han was shocked. From this, he could also tell how high the level of the Black Tower was.

Well, that was true. With merely a slight tremor from it in his last life, his mortal body was dead.

He held up that black thread. Now, this thing was obediently not making any further resistance. He could also sense the power held within it. It was different from Spiritual Qi, but seemed more majestic.

With a thought, he had once again appeared in the outside world.

“Yi?” A consciousness was suddenly moving in his mind.

“Who!?” Ling Han immediately shouted.

“What an intriguing brat!” That consciousness once again resounded. “I discovered a sliver of consciouness had lost contact with me, and it so happened that it is that sliver that is attached to you!”
