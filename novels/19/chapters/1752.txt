Chapter 1753: A great massacre

This was already not Ling Han’s first time coming to Dark Moon City, but Ling Han had never been as confident as he was today. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the past, the origin of his confidence in opposing the Ding Clan was the Black Tower. Even if I was no match for you, I could still hide. However, this actually was extremely inconsistent with Ling Han’s personality.

What he wanted was to settle debts of gratitude and revenge quickly.

And this time, he truly possessed this ability.

‘Come on, Ding Clan. It is time to give you a surprise.’

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden entered into the Black Tower for now. Ling Han and the Empress walked hand in hand. In fact, the Empress showed her true face this time. In this One-Star City, there was no longer anything that they had to fear.

When they arrived at the city gates, they did not even need to release their auras as Severing Mundane Tiers. The Empress’s exquisite beauty and noble demeanor immediately caused those guards to watch in a daze. They involuntarily crouched down automatically, giving the Empress their utmost humble respect.

At first, Mao Dai had wanted to guard Ling Han and the Empress from the dark, but Ling Han refused, so he did not speak further—previously, Ling Han had also successfully escaped from the Ding Clan Manor completely unscathed. This time, with his strength having soared suddenly, there was even less need to worry about him.

Ling Han and the Empress walked towards the Ding Clan Manor. However, though Dark Moon City was only a One-Star City, its territory was really too massive, and added with the restrictions that the Regulations of the Celestial Realm imposed on them, the two of them walked for a whole three days, and only then did they finally arrive at the Ding Clan Manor.

Ling Han headed directly for the main doors while appearing to be extremely relaxed, his arm around the Empress’s waist.

“Stop— yi!?” At first, the guards at the doors planned to call Ling Han and the Empress to a halt, but when they suddenly set eyes on the Empress’s incomparably exquisite beauty, the six of them gaped widely at the same time, their eyes staring fixedly at her, no longer able to utter another word.

“Wife, you can oppose millions and millions of elites on your own!” Ling Han praised.

The Empress’s beauty and demeanor were both top grade. That kind of born air of nobility was capable of making innumerable people bow to her, and it was no wonder that the Empress was so proud.

The Empress broke into a smile, her expression of pride turning into an expression as soft and gentle as water in front of Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Ling Han moved, and sent all six of the people at the main doors flying. Their figures flew and danced like they were straws being blown around in the wind. Some crashed into the main doors, creating a hole in the main doors with the force behind them, and some crashed into the walls. The walls did not break, but their bones were broken, and they were dead.

Ling Han did not give them any mercy. He really did not have the slightest bit of positive feeling for the Ding Clan. This was a clan that was emanating a rotten smell of evil and venom right from its very roots.

...Perhaps even the lairs of mountain bandits would be cleaner than this place.

He could launch a massacre against the mountain bandits, so why couldn’t he do the same here?

Four of the group of six died on the spot, and there were another two that were not too far from death. They were moaning there, just barely breathing.

Ling Han extracted their two spirits for a search, and his expression involuntarily became even more menacing.

As expected, there was not a single good person in the Ding Clan. Even these guards had done many evil deeds, committing acts of tyranny because they had the Ding Clan backing them up, and who knew how many people they had brought to ruin!

“Those who commit great evils should be eliminated, those who commit small sins should also be killed!” Ling Han pointed out a finger. Zi, a bolt of lightning shot out, turning into a battle spear, and killing the two guards that had not died.

Since the heavens were cruel, he would carry out punishment on their behalf!

“Who goes there? To actually there create a disturbance in our Ding Clan!” A few harsh shouts rang out, and seven people shot out from the inside of the Ding Clan Manor. Each of them had expressions of thunderous rage.

The Ding Clan was one of the three great overlords of Dark Moon City; who would dare barge in and cause destruction?

“Oh, no! It’s that despicable brat!”

“L-Ling Han has charged here!”

“Quick, go and get Grand Elder!”

When these seven people saw Ling Han clearly, their faces involuntarily turned green from fear. In the Ding Clan, Ling Han was definitely the person that they loathed the most, but he was also an existence that had been tagged as incredibly dangerous.

Grand Elder Ding Hu had been killed by this despicable brat!

The seven people hurriedly braked, then turned around, and fled. The highest in cultivation level among them was only just a Genesis Tier, so how could they possibly be any match for Ling Han, who was invincible in Genesis Tier—they still did not know that Ling Han had advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, and become a Celestial being.

The Empress moved. Shua, seven flashes of Sword Qi that had taken the form of lightning bolts shot out. Pa, pa, pa, pa. The seven people exploded and turned into nothing the moment they were struck. The destructive power of lightning was really too terrifying.

Ling Han smiled slightly. After the Empress had drunk the Heaven’s Tribulation Fluid, she had grasped two secret techniques of lightning: one of them was this Thunderbolt, and the other was similarly Lightning Flash. Both secret techniques were very practical for use.

The two of them had calm expressions, and they entered into the Ding Clan Manor after exchanging a look.

“For this place that is hiding so much filth, it is best to raze it to the ground.” Ling Han waved his fists and shot out a series of punches. Peng, peng, peng. As the violent power washed out madly, the structures all around instantly collapsed area by area, and the whole Ding Clan was shivering greatly.

Just what level of power was he at by now?

The display of power from a first severance grand elder would be destroying what was old and rotten.

“How dare you!!” A powerful figure appeared, and even more members of the Ding Clan surged out from all around. All of them were glaring at Ling Han furiously, but when they saw the Empress, this kind of raging expression immediately disappeared without a trace.

“Ling Han!” That powerful figure was a first severance grand elder, and his name was Ding Jun. His expression was a little strange because Ding Hu had died in Ling Han’s hands, but according to reason, a Severing Mundane Tier would dominate absolutely over a Genesis Tier. At the moment, he did not know what kind of reaction he should make.

Should he move directly, or should he ask for the mobilization of stronger elites?

However, more than half of the Severing Mundane Tiers of the clan had been sent out to search for Ling Han. Aside from him, there was only one other first severance left behind, and besides them, the only one left was Ding Yaolong.

“Evil brat, you’ve come to receive your death!” a white-haired elder called out. That was a Genesis Tier of the Ding Clan. Even in the Celestial Realm, it was not everyone that could easily cultivate the Genesis Tier.

Ling Han cast a look at that elder. Pa, the elder exploded and turned into a shower of blood under the terrifying pressure.

“How dare you!!” Ding Jun roared in fury. He actually dared commit murder right in front of his eyes? “Evil brat, you are too inhumane!”

“Is that right?” Ling Han stretched out a hand. He grabbed the elder’s spirit that had yet to disperse, and the latter’s memories were quickly displayed at a fast speed. “Raped his maid when he was 15, to take possession of a woman by force, he killed her husband when he was 21. He tortured two girls below 12 years old to death when he was 32... Hoho, such an old beast, what is the point of leaving him alive any further?”

Ling Han’s eyes were cold as he swept his gaze over the members of the Ding Clan around him. “Can I even find a single good person in your Ding Clan?”

The members of the Ding Clan were all infuriated. What were such paltry matters worth?

There were so many people in the Celestial Realm, and merely the population of Dark Moon City numbered in tens of billions. Even if they killed people every single day for entertainment, the people they killed would still be less than the people who would be newly born, so what was there to be so concerned about?

“I know the answer just by looking at your expressions!” Ling Han clenched a fist, and his knuckles cracked loudly. “Since the heavens did not open their eyes to punish you, then I will just have to do the job instead!”

His killing intent was on full display. The only emotion that he had left towards this bunch of animals that wore the disguise of human beings was an uncontrollable killing intent.

They were just animals, so what if they were killed!

He walked out, and with a wave of his fist, peng, peng, peng, peng, there immediately were over a dozen people that were punched so hard they burst, turning into showers of blood that splattered in all directions.

“Today, a river of blood will definitely be flowing in the Ding Clan!” Ling Han declared, his voice as cold as if he was the god of death from hell.
