Chapter 446: Fierce Battle with the Masked Man

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

A very decisive man.

Ling Han nodded in agreement. Even if Yu Kun Lun could defeat him, since the masked man was capable of easily defeating Cao Tian Yi, the former could also naturally defeat Yu Kun Lun easily as well. Thus, the latter simply chose to draw back wisely in the face of overwhelming odds to save some face.

When news of this incident spread, it naturally had some effect on Yu Kun Lun’s reputation. But that would still be better than being publicly defeated in front of all the spectators, what more when he could possibly suffer a crushing defeat.

Ling Han turned his eyes towards the masked man, who also turned to look at him. There was a green-colored light flickering in the eyes of the latter that exuded a terrifying pressure. Even Ling Han, who had a sliver of the divine sense of the Heaven Tier, felt his heart tremble in fear.

How could this be possible!?

Could this be an ultimate cultivator of the Shattering Void Tier that had deliberately disguised himself to participate in this tournament? But if he really was in the Shattering Void Tier, then he could just have simply grabbed the key and what could anyone do? Not just in the north region, even if this happened in the middle state, no one would dare to say anything.

So strange! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Neither Ling Han nor the masked man made any requests to rest, and chose to battle directly instead.

“Have I seen you before?” Ling Han asked smilingly, beginning to probe for information.

The masked man bared his teeth in a grin and said, “I, on the other hand, recognize you, though you have changed your face!”

Ling Han was greatly shocked; someone actually saw through his disguise?

“Come, make your move, and let me see how far your ability has improved,” the masked man said.

Ling Han’s hands curled into fists; he did not dare to be the slightest bit careless. He was completely unable to see through this man; in addition, there was a bone-deep evilness about him which Ling Han despised beyond measure.

Hold on!

Enlightenment flashed through Ling Han’s head and he asked, “Yan?”

“Hehe, so you finally remember?” the masked man asked, smiling.

Yan Tian Zhao!

No wonder this person gave him an indescribably evil feeling; Ling Han had only sensed such shocking evilness on this man before, as if he was the embodiment of evil. Ling Han had never thought that after leaving the Rain Country for almost a year, there would have been such gigantic improvement in his ability. At that time, though Yan Tian Zhao was slightly monstrous as well, he was still very, very far from the shocking extent he was now.

Neither of them called out the other’s real name; you keep my secret, and I’ll keep yours.

“Come fight then!” Ling Han declared, confidence high. He believed that in the same cultivation level, he could sweep away all who stood before him.

“As you wish!” Yan Tian Zhao’s figure shot forth, and charged to attack Ling Han.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. In an instant, the two fighters had exchanged a dozen blows.

Ling Han was stunned. Yan Tian Zhao’s strength was actually not inferior to his at all, and in terms of battle details, the former had achieved a shocking height, as if he was a born warrior who could completely battle based on pure instinct.

There were obviously a few times that he had been caught in a dangerous spot, but Yan Tian Zhao used his elbow to shove, waist to knock, and shoulder to push. It looked like he was not using any particular technique, but he could somehow dissolve the dangerous situation and instead cause quite considerable trouble to Ling Han. If it had not been for the fact that Ling Han had formed the Body of Iron Sheet, he would have likely experienced great loss at his hands.

However, the Body of Iron Sheet was not perfect. After Yan Tian Zhao discovered his shockingly strong defense, he switched from palm strikes to using his fingers to attack, purposely aiming for Ling Han’s eyes. Every strike was sharp and severe, forcing Ling Han into a very difficult position.

When fighting with others, Ling Han could always manage to get the upper hand in the overall battle; the divine sense of the Heaven Tier allowed him to predict the attacks his opponent would make so that he could prepare to parry in advance. In other words, the moment his opponent made a move, victory was already in his grasp.

But it was completely the other way round when fighting with Yan Tian Zhao. He could predict every move that Ling Han made. As a result, though Ling Han had shockingly powerful battle prowess, it was of no use, and he was gradually being suppressed by his opponent.

Ling Han suddenly recalled that Yan Tian Zhao’s eyes once emitted a pressure that caused even him to feel fear and dread; could it be that Yan Tian Zhao, like him, had also been taken over by an elite cultivator? In addition, the former was even stronger than him, and could very possibly be an ultimate elite of the Shattering Void Tier!

Only in that situation would Yan Tian Zhao’s divine sense be able to suppress his own, and completely suppress him in battle prowess as well.

Interesting! Very interesting!

Not only was Ling Han not the slightest bit scared, a burning battle spirit arose in him instead. In the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, there was practically no one able to fight him on equal grounds, and now that a great foe had suddenly appeared, his blood was boiling in excitement.

“Let’s have a good fight!” He laughed loudly, using his War Elephant Fist. Seven dragon heads appeared, and surged towards Yan Tian Zhao.

Yan Tian Zhao could not help but be slightly surprised, and words slipped out of his mouth. “The technique of the Earth Dragon Palace!”

Earth Dragon Palace?

A thought streaked through Ling Han’s head. The War Elephant Fist originated from Na Lan Tu, and Na Lan Tu came from the Earth Dragon Sect. Ever since the Asura Demon Emperor recognized the Mysterious Three Thousand technique as a martial arts technique from the Heaven’s Sword Palace, Ling Han had made a note. Perhaps those few great sects in the middle state all had relations to the realm of gods—Zi Xue Xian from the Blue Thunder Sect even had clansmen in the realm of gods.

Thus, once Yan Tian Zhao said ‘Earth Dragon Palace’, he definitely did not believe that the former had had a slip of the tongue, and wrongly called the Earth Dragon Sect as Earth Dragon Palace.

Hiss, could this guy also have some kind of relation to the realm of gods?

Yan Tian Zhao was sealed by another when he was five years old, and since then, he had always been in a state of coma. Only after he received an alchemical pill from Ling Han had he awoken. After that, no more than a few days, and he had already soared up to the Spiritual Ocean Tier, and furthermore, displayed a very strange power.

If Yan Tian Zhao had always been possessed by a god, then everything could be explained.

...A pressure that could cause his heart to tremble in fear, as well as that extremely meticulous battle ability!

“Who exactly are you?” Ling Han asked somberly.

“Oh, I, too, would like to ask, who are you?” Yan Tian Zhao smiled as he continued to deliver a barrage of attacks with his fists. He obviously did not have a single flash of Fist Qi, but the punches he delivered were extremely powerful and oppressive, and it seemed as if Ling Han delivered himself up to be punched to show the absolute control that his opponent had over the battle.

‘Indeed!’

Ling Han nodded internally. The other had definitely been taken over by an elite cultivator, who could very possibly be a god! At that time, someone must have seen something odd about him, but had only sealed Yan Tian Zhao away, causing him to go into deep slumber. But now that he had been “unsealed”, this soul could finally take complete control over this body and display a terrifying battle prowess.

“You’ve come from the realm of gods, right?” Ling Han continued to exchange blows with the other, whilst asking in a lowered voice. This was too universally shocking, and he did not want to be overheard by anyone else.

“Realm of gods?” Yan Tian Zhao laughed loudly, and similarly lowering his voice, he said, “Frog at the bottom of a well, even close to the moment of your death, you remain ignorant. How very amusing.”

“What do you mean?” Ling Han questioned.

“Perhaps a few dozen years, or perhaps over a hundred years later, you will know!” Yan Tian Zhao said coldly. “But now, lose! I am determined to win the treasure in the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realms!”

“Haha!” Ling Han laughed coldly as well. “If that is so, then I can’t allow you to have your way even more!”

“You can’t stop me!” Yan Tian Zhao declared arrogantly. “Now, I can display close to a hundred percent of my battle prowess; how could you possibly be able to oppose me?”

“Don’t forget, I am only in the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier!” Ling Han said with a smile. This was his greatest advantage.

Yan Tian Zhao could not help his eyes turning cold. Though he had completely taken control of this body and could display his full battle prowess in it, he, too, was restricted by the power of this body, and his battle prowess was not without its limits.

Ling Han was already so powerful now, so if he reached the ninth layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, his battle prowess would definitely rise a few more levels and he would be even more difficult to stand against at that time.

“Then I can’t allow you to live even more!” A green pentagram lit up in Yan Tian Zhao’s eyes and he raised his hands. Instantly, multiple green silken strands spread out.

Peng!

It was precisely at this moment that a man was seen hurriedly rushing into the Great Arena, and exclaimed in shock, “Milord Clan Head, the key has been stolen by a weirdo that hid in a coffin!”
