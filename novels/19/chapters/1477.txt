1478 The Killing Formation Shows its Migh

The one standing in his way was a tall man with broad shoulders. He looked to be about in his thirties, and had been in the academy for an unknown number of years. It would probably be a very astonishing number of years, or he couldn’t have possibly attained the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier.Advancing into the Eternal River Tier itself needed a very, very long time, what more when he had advanced to the medium extreme?

“A dog blocking the way?” Ling Han asked, smiling calmly.

“Wang, whom are you insulting!!” The large black dog appeared and disappeared unpredictably, and had extremely good hearing. He popped out in an instant. “Brat, you dare look down on Grandpa Dog— hiss!” His dog’s eyes widened in a glare directed at Ling Han, all the black fur on his body was standing on ends, and one of his tails was even standing upright like a javelin out of his steel undergarment.

“What medicine have you ingested, brat? Why are you giving Grandpa Dog a very scary feeling?” the large black dog exclaimed in surprise.

Ling Han was involuntarily shocked. This damn dog’s senses were really sharp. Could it be that he had discovered the 10 killing formations inscribed in his body? He should not know the reason for it, but still could sense this kind of oppressive pressure.

As expected of a dog that had been brought from the Celestial Realm. However, he was still a damn dog.

“Are you two finished?” The man standing in the way was angered. ‘Are the two of you playing around with me with your banter?’

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and asked, “You called me, so what business do you have to do with me?”

“You are asking a question that you already know the answer to!” The man smirked coldly. “I am Jia Liang, and have entered the academy 18,000,000 years ago. I am your senior brother! Now that you have met me, should you not respectfully address me as senior brother?”

Ling Han waved a hand. “Since you already said that I asked the question while knowing the answer, then I will ask you as well. If someone wants to slap your face, will you still politely address him as senior brother?”

The large black dog immediately interrupted and quipped, “Right, right, wouldn’t that be being wretched?”

Jia Liang’s expression involuntarily darkened even further. At first, he had wanted to put on airs as a senior brother, and make Ling Han feel sullen first, yet he had not thought that Ling Han would actually be such a hoodlum that he would not give face to even him.

A troublemaker was still a troublemaker, after all. No wonder he had dared to challenge the tradition of the academy. Unfortunately, his strength was too weak.

“Since you are still so stubborn, then as your senior brother, I can only choose to teach you what respect is!” He made his move without any reservations. He stretched out a palm, and weng, a silver river unfolded and heavenly bodies floated in the air.

Though he was an elite of formations, the gap in their cultivation levels was too large. Merely with his own power, he would be able to completely suppress Ling Han, so what need was there for him to use the power of formations?

Using a sledgehammer on a nut? This junior brother would not be worth him doing that.

It was a simple palm, yet covered the ground and shadowed the skies. This was the strength of the Eternal River Tier. A casual strike would be able to drive the great power of the heaven and earth. Heavenly Body Tiers were completely no match for that.

Ling Han naturally dared not be careless, either. With a thought, the 10 killing formations activated at the same time. Suddenly, the bones in his body lit up one by one, but because his physique was too powerful, his skin, flesh, and blood had forcibly concealed this kind of radiance, and at a glance... he was still incredibly ordinary.

Yet the large black dog’s fur stood on ends once more. He leaped nine meters high into the air, and hurriedly ran in retreat. He had sensed that there seemed to be a frightening monster hidden inside Ling Han’s body, and could easily kill even him.

The reason why he was cunning was because he was highly skilled in the art of running for his life. Otherwise, if he would be turned into a dead dog at any random move, how could he possibly dare to be so arrogant?

Ling Han casually waved his hand, and the Lightning Sword Technique appeared, slicing towards Jia Liang.

“Overestimating your own abilities!” Jia Liang humphed coldly. A Heavenly Body Tier actually dared face him head-on. No matter how freakishly talented he was, he was fated to lose!

This brat thought that he could consider everyone else beneath him just because he had defeated a few in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier?

What a joke, Jia Liang was in the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier!

“Suppress!” His right hand shook, and his fingers turned into a prison of heaven and earth, descending onto Ling Han.

The fingers descended. They were obviously only five fingers, yet seemed like mountain peaks.

“Break!” Ling Han stated indifferently.

Sword Qi struck. Boom, the mountain of five fingers were easily severed into pieces.

Jia Liang’s mouth involuntarily gaped. This was too inconceivable. That was his attack, the attack of the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier. How could it possibly be so easily and calmly broken?

If you f***** really had that kind of abilities, why would you have been so strained in the deadly battle with the 13 elites in the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier?

That day, he, too, had witnessed the battle, and he could claim to be fully aware of the depth of Ling Han’s abilities. If Ling Han’s abilities could undergo such a massive transformation in a mere year’s time... He definitely would not believe that; that had to be a lie!

For those who had reached this kind of height like them, the time needed to improve their abilities by just a bit would have to be 10,000 years, and that was the minimum, what more when this wasn’t just a bit, but rather 10,000 times!

“I’ve underestimated you!” Though Jia Liang was surprised, he did not lose his head. He had not used his full power in that last strike at all. At this moment, the bones inside his body glowed one after another. A killing formation was activated, and suddenly, the light of the Five Elements and the Qi of Yinyang appeared on the surface of his body.

The formation he had inscribed was actually the Yinyang Five Element Formation as well!

“Get lost!” he shouted loudly, and activated the formation’s might to the fullest, not daring to underestimate Ling Han in the slightest bit any longer. This rookie was really too unique.

Ling Han smiled calmly. ‘You only have a single Yinyang Five Element Formation, and as for me?’

’10!

‘In a clash of 10 against one, would I still be unable to beat a piece of trash like you?’

With a gesture of his finger, the Lightning Sword Technique unfolded to the fullest, and underneath the rolling heaven’s might was the massive explosion of 10 Yinyang Five Element Formations.

Boom!

Jia Liang greeted the attack with his own formation, an expression of disdain on his face. He was sure that all the bones in Ling Han’s body would be completely shattered under the crushing suppression of this attack. Of course, he would be careful and not kill Ling Han, nor would he damage his life force. This was the great taboo of the academy.

However, his expression immediately became one of utter shock; that was because his attack fell apart with a single strike from Ling Han! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

‘How is this possible?!’

The attack that should have been unable to resist a single blow should have been Ling Han’s; why was the tables turned around on him?

Boom, wearing an expression of unfathomable disbelief, so much that he looked like he was doubting life itself, Jia Liang was sent flying. He sputtered out a mouthful of blood that sprayed out into the skies, and seemed like a rainbow under the radiant sunlight.

He landed heavily on the ground, and caused the dirt to fly up in a wave.

A deathly silence fell over the surroundings.

Ling Han was a “celebrity” now. Though he was a troublemaker that broke the rules in the eyes of the seniors, that did not stop him from becoming famous—not only because of his nature-defying performance on the first day, but also because he had an exquisitely beautiful wife that would make anyone drool.

When Jia Liang appeared, those that planned to watch the excitement had naturally appeared as well to watch the battle, but who would have imagined that this would be the result?

This was unrealistic! This was illogical! They must have f****** seen a ghost!

Everyone could not help but rub their eyes, and then look again, but the one lying on the ground was still Jia Liang.

F***, he had really defied nature this time round!

Everyone knew that the peak of the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier was equivalent to the strength of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier, and strength did not represent battle prowess. Hence, some freaks were capable of matching even those at the middle stage, late stage, and even peak stage of the low extreme of the Eternal River Tier.

That was still something that everyone could accept.

But this time, it was an elite in the medium extreme, and furthermore, was not one in the early stage of the medium extreme, either, but rather in the late stage!

What the heck; everyone could feel their hair stand on ends, as if their heads would be exploding at any second.
