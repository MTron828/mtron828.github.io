Chapter 200: Lady Yan’s Plans

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

“What’s the matter?” Ling Han asked.

Yun Shuang Shuang only continued to weep. Thankfully, this place was quite remote. Otherwise, anyone would have thought Ling Han was bullying her.

“If you don’t tell me, how am I supposed to help you? Fine, finish crying, then tell me.” Ling Han opened the door and went back in. Right when he was about to close the door, Yun Shuang Shuang squeezed in and grabbed onto the corner of his shirt with a delicate hand.

“I say, why do all of you like to grab onto the corner of my shirt? It’s understandable if it was Niu Niu, but men do this, and women do this too. I am really troubled by this,” Ling Han said, shaking his head.

“En!” Hu Niu gave a strong nod, and made her opinion clear. “Ling Han is Niu’s!”

“Milady, Milady, she…” It was obvious Yun Shuang Shuang was not in the mood for jokes. She had just opened her mouth to explain when she started to cry again.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “In three breaths’ time, if you still persist in sniveling, I’ll throw you out!”

“So mean!” Liu Ru Er walked out of the house, and glared harshly at Ling Han.

“En, it seems that it would not be enough to just simply throw one out!” Ling Han shuffled his sleeves.

“Haha, damn scoundrel, let me tell you. I have already recovered about 70% of my cultivation, and no longer need to fear your threats!” Liu Ru Er said proudly.

“Then why aren’t the two of you quickly getting lost? Everything you eat and use everyday is mine, don’t you know all that needs money?” Ling Han said in irritation.

Liu Ru Er instantly exploded in anger. She felt that this guy did not have the slightest inclination to feel tender and protective towards women. It was obvious that she and her sister were rare beauties, but this guy did not bear any ideas or intentions towards them at all. What a weirdo!

Yi, could it be that he preferred men?

That was possible. Otherwise, how could he simply ignore the charm of her sister and her?

When she thought about this, she could not help but feel a shiver all over her body.

But after being interrupted by the banter between the two of them, Yun Shuang Shuang finally regained her composure, and said, “Please take me in, Young Master Han. Shuang Shuang has no other place to go.”

“En?” Ling Han was startled, and said, “Aren’t you of the Cherishing Flower Pavilion? But you actually came here to beg me for shelter; what kind of logic is that? Do you all think that my place is a garbage collection ground? One, two, and now three, and who knows if there will be even more in the future?”

Liu Ru Er was instantly furious, and said, “Who are you calling garbage?”

“Young Master Han, Milady… Milady is too cruel!” Yun Shuang Shuang once again began to weep.

“All right, all right. Just calm yourself and speak slowly. Start from the beginning. Don’t keep speaking in one breath and crying in the next; otherwise, I really wouldn’t be able to stand it,” Ling Han said.

“Come, sit down first.” Liu Ru Er rolled her eyes at Ling Han, and helped Yun Shuang Shuang into the house. After helping her to sit down, she even fetched a cup of hot tea to calm Yun Shuang Shuang down.

Ling Han looked at Hu Niu, and Hu Niu looked back at him. The two simultaneously shrugged. They were the real owners, but why was it they seemed more like outsiders here?

Yun Shuang Shuang held onto the cup of tea and rested for a while before finally opening her mouth and telling her story.

Yan Tian Zhao managing to awake was supposed to be a good thing, but for Yun Shuang Shuang, it was the beginning of her nightmare. She had coincidentally eavesdropped on a conversation between Lady Yan and Yan Tian Zhao—it seemed that it was not because Lady Yan wanted a place to invest her energy and hopes into that she had been adopted. Instead, there had been a different motive for her adoption right from the beginning…

She was a furnace!

Lady Yan most likely knew that her son would not be able to awaken for quite some time, but there was only so much optimal time for cultivation for a martial artist, so how could she allow her son to lag behind at the starting line.

It just so happened that she had obtained an unusual cultivation technique that was divided into two—main and subsidiary—techniques. The subsidiary technique was to be cultivated by one person, while the main technique was to be cultivated by another. When the time came, as long as the two people cultivated together, then the person who had cultivated the main technique would be able to easily “swallow” the person who had cultivated the subsidiary technique—her cultivation and even vitality!

And the cultivation technique that she had practiced since her childhood was precisely the subsidiary technique, in order for her to pave the way for Yan Tian Zhao.

The reason why they had not taken action immediately was because Yan Tian Zhao had only just awakened, and had just begun to cultivate the main technique. As long as he was slightly accomplished in his cultivation, they would take action, and by that time, not only would Yun Shuang Shuang lose all her cultivation, she would also lose her vitality. She would, in an extremely short period of time, become an old woman.

“If Milady had treated me sincerely, I am willing to die for Milady, no questions asked. But I can’t accept this!” Yun Shuang Shuang had cried so much, her eyes were red.

“She’s so evil! Too evil!” Liu Ru Er wiped her tears as well where she was standing. She was so easily moved to tears that Ling Han mocked her inside his head. ‘Hey, you’re an assassin, okay? Don’t be so emotional, all right?’

Ling Han pondered for a moment, then said, “Lady Yan has been active for so many years, and must have a very wide system of connections and a similarly wide information network in the Imperial City. The fact that you’re staying here would not be able to stay hidden for very long. At that time, when Lady Yan comes to seek you out, would you be able to resist?”

If she decided that she wanted to take her adopted daughter with her, that would be a right and proper thing. Even the laws of the Empire would side with Lady Yan—if Ling Han attempted to stop her, then it would be he who had kidnapped her daughter.

Ling Han had his backers, but so did Lady Yan, and her backer was also very powerful.

Yun Shuang Shuang could not help but pale, and began to shudder. She would rather die than be taken back by Lady Yan.

“That’s right. Those two girls should have mostly recovered from their injuries. Why don’t you go with them and leave Rain Country?” Ling Han suggested to Yun Shuang Shuang. That would be great; he’d be able to solve three huge problems in one go.

“Who told you we were leaving Rain Country?” Liu Ru Er leaped up. “I am definitely going to kill that traitor!”

“I think you’re more likely to die than kill anyone!” Ling Han pointed out, dampening her enthusiasm, and continued, “It would be better if the two of you return and work hard on your cultivation. Xu Ke Xin has been deceived once, so she would definitely not fall into the trap a second time. The two of you no longer have the chance to set up a trap to ambush her.”

Liu Ru Er pouted. She wanted to argue, but knew that Ling Han was telling the truth. The power gap between the two of them and Xu Ke Xin was too large, and they had also lost the advantage of taking the initiative. Thus, it was practically impossible for them to once again attempt to assassinate Xu Ke Xin.

“Mister Ling is right.” Liu Feng Er walked out as well, and said, “When we finally recover from our injuries, we will immediately leave Rain Country. We are extremely grateful for how you have taken care of us for this period of time, and hope that there will be a chance for us two sisters to repay your kindness, Mister Ling.”

“Ha, it would be the best repayment for me if you leave,” Ling Han said bluntly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“En! En!” Hu Niu nodded seriously as well.

This detestable guy!

Liu Ru Er humphed, and said, “Scoundrel, if you come to Fire Country in the future and get into trouble, remember to look for us. We will definitely take‘very good’ care of you!”

She emphasized the words ‘very good’ heavily; obviously, she held a big grudge towards him.

“All right. You can stay with the two sisters for tonight, and leave after a few days,” Ling Han said to Yun Shuang Shuang, pretending he had not heard anything.

“Thank you, Young Master Han. Thank you, Misses.” Yun Shuang Shuang lowered into a bow.

Peng, peng, peng. It was at this moment that there came a knock on the door, causing the four of them to be startled at the same time.

“Mister Ling, are you there?” A soft, sweet voice was heard from outside, yet it was this voice that caused Yun Shuang Shuang to shiver uncontrollably. Her face had paled completely from terror.

“Lady Yan?” the Liu sisters mouthed.

Ling Han nodded.

“Kill her!” Instantly, Liu Ru Er was boiling with killing intent.
