Chapter 2628: Inheritance of Flames

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Celestial King in green trembled in terror.

Those were two Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings! Regardless of whether it was the Celestial King Graveyard or the Flaming Frost Realm, these were still paramount and powerful beings! Yet, they had been completely powerless before Ling Han, killed as if they were mere ants.

Ignoring the Empress, the man in green hurriedly turned around to flee.

“Hmph!” The Empress immediately activated her Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique, affecting the flow of time. The speed of the Celestial King in green instantly fell by a dramatic amount.

“Physique of time?” the Celestial King in green exclaimed in shock. He hurriedly shook his body and unleashed his full might, drawing on the power of Seventh Heaven Regulations. His speed instantly returned to normal.

!!

This was the power of the Great Dao, impossible to infiltrate by any power!

However, the Empress had already seized this opportunity to catch up to him. She slashed down with her sword, her attack like a roar that reverberated through the heavens.

“Move aside!” the Celestial King in green bellowed as he hurriedly unleashed a spiritual attack. The Empress immediately faltered, and he seized this opportunity to flee.

The Celestial King promised himself that he would never cross paths with this man and woman ever again. They were far too f*cking freakish!

Whoosh!

All he saw was a blur as a person suddenly materialized before him.

Ling Han!

‘Gasp! How is he so quick?!

‘The Regulations of Space! It’s definitely the Regulations of Space! Otherwise, how can his speed possibly be so terrifying?!’

He was deeply astounded. Regardless of whether one was hunting someone else or fleeing from someone else, it was always most frightening to come across someone who had mastered the Regulations of Space.

“The fight isn’t over, so why are you fleeing?” Ling Han asked in a calm voice. However, he didn’t attack.

The Empress caught up, and immediately slashed with her sword.

The Celestial King in green had no option but to block this attack. Otherwise, he would definitely be killed.

If he fought, Ling Han would continue to spectate the battle. If he tried to flee, however, Ling Han would immediately dash over to block him.

The Celestial King in green also understood that it would be impossible to flee. With this in mind, he decided that he had to defeat and then capture the Empress. He could then use her to threaten Ling Han. Otherwise, he would definitely be killed here.

After making this decision, he immediately abandoned all thoughts of escape. He unleashed his full strength as he battled against the Empress.

Even though he was a weak Celestial King, the fact that he had become a Celestial King was already proof enough of his talent. He threw punch after punch, with his battle prowess being extremely chaotic and violent. If it weren’t for her Celestial Tool, the Empress would actually be no match for this Celestial King.

After all, even though she was a supreme monarch star, there was still a gulf of two Heavens between them.

However, her Celestial Tool completely changed the situation, allowing her to gain the upper hand. The Celestial King in green was completely suppressed, unable to threaten the Empress.

After 3000 or so exchanges, the Empress unleashed another slash.

Pu!

The Celestial King in green was immediately beheaded.

Ling Han gazed into the distance, saying, “By the looks of it, our journey is going to become a difficult one.”

The three people had only been Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings. If the couple came across Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, Ling Han would still be able to suppress them if they were only ordinary Celestial Kings. However, things would be much more difficult if they were monarch tiers. If they were monarch stars, then their strength would definitely surpass Ling Han’s. Things would only be direr if they were supreme monarch stars.

“There are still at least three lands of inheritance,” the Empress said.

Ling Han nodded in agreement. After learning the two lightning techniques, he became increasingly interested in obtaining the remaining three lightning techniques. Only by fusing them together could he truly unleash the might of the Heavenly Venerate Technique.

They advanced with courage, overcoming several ambushes from Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings.

Right now, they were only being attacked by Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings. This was most likely because the others thought that Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings were powerful enough to suppress Ling Han and the Empress. However, after the pursuers were exterminated time and time again, the people in the Celestial King Graveyard finally understood that Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings were unable to kill Ling Han and the Empress.

Thereupon, Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings started to hunt the two.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the Empress arrived before a lofty mountain. This mountain was crimson, yet this wasn’t because of its geology or its vegetation. Instead, this was because this mountain was an active volcano, with lava flowing down its sides and dying the entire mountain red.

Arcs of crimson lightning flashed inside the lava, transforming into the shapes of all kinds of animals.

There wasn’t anyone blocked by this mountain, because it was possible to walk around it.

However, Ling Han and the Empress didn’t plan to walk around this mountain. They had already obtained two lightning secret techniques, so based on their analysis, it was extremely likely that a third was hidden here—the Lightning of Fire.

“Let’s take a look.”

They entered the premises of the mountain. However, before they even neared the lava, they could already feel the waves of heat surging over, and turning their clothes charcoal black.

The two of them naturally didn’t want to wander around naked, so they immediately activated their Source Power, forming a shield of light around themselves. The circulation of Regulations could repel the fearsome heat.

However, this was only the beginning. The closer to the lava they got, the more terrifying the heat became. Eventually, they had no option but to walk in mid-air.

They circled the lofty mountain once, yet they didn’t make any discoveries.

“Perhaps this place doesn’t contain any Heavenly Venerate Technique?” They couldn’t help but converse, becoming skeptical of their initial analysis.

“Unless…”

The two of them exchanged a glance, saying, “The inheritance is inside the lava!”

“I’ll go and take a look,” Ling Han said to the Empress. His physique was freakishly powerful, and his defensive abilities were also far superior to the Empress’.

The Empress nodded as she sat down cross-legged.

Ling Han had initially wanted the Empress to enter the Celestial Guest Residence, but he immediately abandoned this thought after seeing this. With the Empress’ strength, and with the might of her Celestial Tool, she would be able to flee even if she came across an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han descended from the sky, and directly entered the lava. A heat 100 times more terrifying than before instantly enveloped him, disintegrating his shield in a flash.

Tsss…

His clothes caught fire before instantly disintegrating and turning into dust.

However, this was the only option. Symbols appeared on his body, emitting a golden glow.

He was actively channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

With his current cultivation, even those with a battle prowess at the Ninth Heaven would need to attack him several times if they wanted to wound him. Moreover, following his rise in cultivation, he could also channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll for longer and longer.

He wandered around the sea of flames, with his eyes gleaming with brilliance. Even the surrounding lava was unable to suppress this brilliance.

Ling Han scoured the surroundings inch by inch. This lava contained the powerful Regulations of Flames, affecting his vision and not allowing him to see too far. Thus, he could only observe his immediate surroundings, which greatly reduced his speed.

After an hour, he flew out of the lava. Firstly, he couldn’t push himself until he was completely unable to channel the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Secondly, he needed to check in on the Empress. After all, they were the enemies of this entire realm.

The Empress was peacefully seated, and after taking a single glance around, Ling Han also landed next to the Empress, recovering some of his Source Power.

One day later, Ling Han entered the lava again. He had already recovered to his peak state.

He could only explore a limited area each day, and he definitely couldn’t leave before he finished exploring the entire mountain.

Three days, five days, 10 days… In the blink of an eye, three months had already passed.

On this day, a smile quickly spread across Ling Han’s face after he entered the lava. This was because he discovered that the ground here was different. There was a distinct vein, and it looked much like the meridian veins of a person.

This vein appeared natural, as if it were merely a part of the mountain that had been formed in a slightly strange shape. However, Ling Han didn’t think this. He saw what was hidden inside these veins.

‘Indeed, this is the third land of inheritance,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He was slightly engrossed as he started to investigate this. If he failed to find the formation eye, he would eventually be assaulted by the boundless flames and lightning, something that even his physique wouldn’t be able to withstand.

Meanwhile, above the lava.

Weng!

A terrifying aura descended, after which a Celestial King walked over from the sky. His body was surrounded by eight ribbons of iridescent light!

The Empress was instantly awakened with a start. She opened her beautiful eyes and looked over at the Celestial King.

“You’re the outsider who’s come here to train?” the Eighth Heaven Celestial King asked. Even with his disposition, when he swept his gaze across the Empress, his heart couldn’t help but flutter. However, he immediately suppressed this feeling.

The Empress didn’t respond. It had only ever been she who asked the questions. How could the opposite be allowed?

She immediately drew her sword, pointing it at the Eighth Heaven Celestial King.
