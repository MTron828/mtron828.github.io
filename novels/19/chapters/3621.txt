Chapter 3622: Throwing Fruits at you

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

The Tree Man crumbled, and near its roots, there was a ray of light. Upon a closer look, that was actually a drop of green liquid, pitifully small.

Essence of Wood.

Ling Han put away the essence of Wood, and continued to search for new Tree

Men.

At first, he had thought that since the Tree Man was a plant-type, they would have an indifferent nature. Thus, he did not attack directly, because killing him for no reason was not in line with Ling Han’s way of doing things.

But now that the Tree Man was so fierce, Ling Han would be able to kill him without any psychological burden.

He searched for a new Tree Man, and then attacked without any reservations.

After half a day, he had gained quite a lot, but this efficiency was still no match for when he had been in Extreme Flame Valley, but was much better than his experiences at the Cold Water Lake. However, the he had encountered a fortuitous encounter at the Cold Water Lake, and he had only spent a total of two months there.

In this case, it might take four months, or even slightly longer.

Ling Han could only hope that he would be able to encounter a Tree Man King, and gain a lot all at once.

The next day, when the sun had just risen, Ling Han first dragged the little loli out to cultivate together, then went to eat.

This just happened to be one of the nodal points for his cultivation. This time, he opened another nine apertures, and took another step further on the path of cultivation.

Ling Han continued to move. Fighting monsters was naturally an extremely boring task, but there was nothing he could do about it. For the sake of becoming stronger in the future, he had to be able to bear the weariness and loneliness.

“Brat, stop right there!” Not long after he left, someone called out to him.

The other was a middle-aged man in his forties. He held a saber in his hand, and looked very fierce.

“Hand over the essence of Wood, or die!” The man waved the saber in his hand.

A strange smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “You truly want to

rob me?”

“Less nonsense, ah—”

After a while, the middle-aged man cried. That damn brat, not only did he turn around and rob him completely, he even stripped him of all his clothes, and hung him from a tree. If anyone passed by, they would be able to admire his little c*ck.

How humiliating.

Ling Han decided to rob others as well. This was the only way to quickly make a fortune.

Moreover, the reason why they were fighting Tree Men here was because they were hired by the Pang Clan.

He started to get busy. When he saw Tree Men, he would fight Tree Men, and when he saw cultivators, he would rob them. Sometimes, he would even have to fight Demonic Beasts. Life was truly colorful.

In the blink of an eye, 20 days had passed. While Ling Han had obtained a great many essence of Wood, he had also pushed the number of apertures he had opened up to 63.

He traversed through the forest, searching for prey.

‘Hmm?’

He made a discovery. There was an incredibly tall giant tree ahead of him. It was probably at least three hundred meters tall. It had spread out its massive crown, and even in this forest, it stood out like a swan among chickens.

‘Tree Man King?’

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. There really was such a being.

“Don’t even think about it!” A cold voice rang out.

Ling Han turned his head, and saw that not too far to his right, there was presently a young man standing with his sword behind his back. His hands were crossed behind his back, filled with the air of showing off.

Though Ling Han was also very fond of showing off, he was naturally displeased to see others show off.

“Did you grow this tree?” Ling Han asked.

“Don’t be flippant,” the sword-bearing man said calmly. “This is a thousand-year-old tree, and it’s not something you can deal with. Don’t seek death! Obediently watch from the sidelines. When I kill this thousand-year-old locust tree and take away the tree heart, you’ll naturally be able to obtain the essence of Wood.”

Yi, he was quite caring.

Ling Han looked at the large tree in disbelief. This was actually an old monster that was 1000 years old?

He smiled and said, “Since he’s already lived for a thousand years, it’s clear that he’s extremely skilled at staying alive. You mightn’t be able to deal with him.” “Humph, you don’t have to worry about that!” The sword-bearing man strode towards the thousand-year-old locust tree. He drew his sword, and naturally, a powerful aura circulated, which was very extraordinary.

Xiu!

Right at this moment, a black shadow actually smashed over from the locust tree, striking out at the sword-bearing man.

Ling Han looked closely. That was a fruit.

Was the old locust tree trying to make the first move?

The sword-bearing man naturally saw it as well. He drew his sword. Shua, sword light swept past, and that fruit was sliced into two halves. However, this was only the beginning. Boom, the two halves of the fruit actually exploded abruptly.

Under the violent surge of energy, the sword-bearing man was instantly sent flying, coughing up copious amounts of blood.

F***( what was this, an Explosion Fruit?

Ling Han couldn’t help but think of the Ethereal Peak. The vegetable fields there also had these fruits that would explode. Watermelons, loofahs, and grapes had all become deadly weapons with great destructive power. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had not thought that he would encounter it here again.

If this really was a thousand-year-old locust tree, then it could be imagined what kind of fatal move it would have developed.

“Zhi, zhi, zhi, zhi!” On the trunk of the old locust tree, a purple-coloured squirrel appeared. Its two small front paws were holding onto a fruit, and it was currently barking downwards, looking very furious.

Yi, could it be that the fruit just now had been thrown by this squirrel?

Hold on.

Ling Han was a little confused. Wasn’t this a locust tree? What was a squirrel like you doing on a locust tree? You are not eating pine nuts; have you changed your diet?

Xiu, the purple squirrel raised its two small paws high, then smashed them downwards. That fruit was then thrown again towards the sword-bearing man. After suffering a loss once, the sword-bearing man naturally would not repeat the same mistake. He hurriedly leaped up, and dodged this toss.

Boom!

The fruit crashed onto the ground, instantly creating a huge explosion. A terrifying energy surged madly, and even Ling Han, who was standing very far away, was affected.

“Zhi, zhi, zhi, zhi!” The purple squirrel jumped up and down, as if to say, ‘This is my territory, so don’t even think of taking it over.

Was this thrower added with the Explosion Fruit the reason why the old locust tree could live for more than a thousand years without being knocked down?

The sword-bearing man humphed. He attacked again, his figure darting like a dragon.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The little squirrel continued to smash the fruits, but not one of them hit him. Just as he was about to climb up the tree, a terrifying scene appeared. At least a hundred fruits were thrown out at the same time.

This was practically a rain of fruits, densely packed together, and there was no way to dodge at all.

The sword-bearing man hurriedly turned around and retreated rapidly. Hong, hong, hong! The fruits exploded, forming a brilliant storm of energy. On the tree, small squirrels popped out, one after another. Upon counting, there were at least over a hundred of them.

Just now, it was them that had smashed the fruits together, forcing the man with the sword to retreat.

However, aside from the first one, the others all had grey fur, which made that purple-coloured squirrel appear very conspicuous.

Could this be some kind of foreign species?

“Say, urn, do you need help?” Ling Han asked the sword-bearing man.

“No need!” the man said through gritted teeth.

“Then we will both act alone.” Ling Han naturally wouldn’t listen to him. He dashed out and charged towards the old locust tree.

“I already said, watch from the sidelines!” the sword-bearing man shouted loudly, and set off in rapid pursuit of Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and brandished a fist at the man.

Boom! Bursts of devastating power surged into the surroundings. The man was shocked. He had not thought that Ling Han’s power would actually be so strong. He shot out a flash of Sword Qi to disperse it. Pu, his sword technique was actually quite brilliant, forcibly splitting apart the power of his fist.

However, Ling Han had already dashed ahead of him..
