Chapter 2368: Noble ideals

Heavenly Venerable Tier had surpassed Regulations. What kind of lofty existence was this?

Every single person that could become a Heavenly Venerate was a prodigy among prodigies; who would be weaker than the other?

Even if Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was in a weak state, now that he had the lead, he was not afraid that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity would catch up to him, either.?Boom, he rushed into the energy storm, all signs of him disappearing immediately.

Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity came to an abrupt stop. He could charge in, but he would definitely suffer severe injuries, and with the overall level of the Celestial Realm being lower, the power targeting him would instead be stronger. In a state of severe injury, he would definitely be killed.

He roared to the heavens, his voice thunderous and echoing throughout the entire Foreign Realm, which instantly drew the notice of various Heavenly Venerates, who manifested their divine sense here. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Setting the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity aside, after Heavenly Venerate Wu Le charged into the energy storm, his hand held Ling Han, using his supreme power to protect him, yet he, with noble aspirations, faced the energy storm head-on.

He had been imprisoned for over a dozen epochs, and had almost been refined. Naturally, he would prefer to die in battle instead.

He spat out blood continuously. Heavenly Venerable Tier was indeed superior to Regulations, but at least First Tier Heavenly Venerate was not enough to stand against the heaven and earth. Being barraged by the energy storm, his whole body was bathed in blood, and even his bones broke one after another.

But this Heavenly Venerate’s fighting spirit blazed even higher. There was a faith keeping him strong—he was determined to deliver Ling Han safely back to the Celestial Realm even if it meant his death.

As he saw it, this was the hope of the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han was the sole and only person who had managed to venture into the Foreign Realm and return completely unscathed. If Ling Han could become a Heavenly Venerate, he could possibly become the strongest Heavenly Venerate.

He burst out with his full power, traversing through the energy storm bit by bit.

Heavenly Venerable Tier power soared into the heavens, and he roared repeatedly. His noble aspirations surged as he brandished his fists continuously. He was practically invincible, endless light surging out of his body, dazzling the ages.

With every punch he shot out, the energy storm would be blasted apart, and a vacuum would appear, and even the Timestream could be glimpsed.

This was a Heavenly Venerate, superior to Regulations and endlessly close to heaven and earth itself.

Boom, he charged out of the energy storm, standing proudly in the skies.

“I have returned!” He released a bold, loud laugh. He then took a deep breath. Boundless power of heaven and earth turned into a visible stream that poured out towards his body.

Initially, he was battered and bruised, but with the pouring of the strong power of heaven and earth into him, there were signs that his injuries were actually slowly recovering, but right at this moment, thunderclouds gathered densely, with lightning flashing in their depths, striking out at the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le.

This lightning possessed frightening might, and actually stopped the recovery of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s injuries.

The heavens despised him!

A Heavenly Venerate had snatched the power of heaven and earth, surpassed Regulations, and was no longer under the authority of the heaven and earth; at the same time, he was also abandoned by the heaven and earth. Thus, the moment he appeared, he would be targeted by the heaven and earth, and if he actually fought, it would be even more serious.

He wanted to heal his injuries, what more when it was such heavy Dao injury?

That was practically impossible!

Suddenly, the supply of power of heaven and earth stopped, and Heavenly Venerate Wu Le frowned greatly. If he was still in his prime state, he would not need to fear being obstructed by the heaven and earth. He could snatch it by force. After all, the heaven and earth could not directly interfere with him, and could only act through Regulations, but even the strongest Regulations would only be at the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier.

But now that his strength had dropped to rock bottom, he had also used the last bit of his power when he passed through the energy storm. He really was at the end of his line now.

Weng, a figure appeared, exuding a great aura that suppressed the heaven and earth.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate!

The moment he appeared, he was naturally targeted by the heaven and earth as endless lightning blasted down on him.

“Wu Le!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate exclaimed in shock. He was incredibly stunned. This person in front of him should have died over a dozen epochs ago, and now he had actually made a sudden reappearance. Even with his subtlety, he was stunned.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le smiled boldly, and asked, “Never thought I could return again, right?”

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate humphed, his face expressionless, yet a wild storm was taking place in his heart. In the past, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had used himself to crash into the connecting point of the two realms, just like the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, sacrificing himself to protect the Celestial Realm.

And now Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had appeared once more; then what about the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable?

If the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had not died, matters would really become troublesome.

Thank goodness!

He swept an eye over the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. The latter’s power of heaven and earth was practically exhausted, and he was also severely injured. Even if he made no move, the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le would still rapidly walk towards death.

“This disobedient brat!” When Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate spotted Ling Han, who was still in Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s grasp, a flash of killing intent flickered in his eyes. Previously, he had personally pursued Ling Han, yet the latter had actually managed to flee into the Foreign Realm. This was a humiliation to him.

How could a Heavenly Venerate fail?

“Hand over this disobedient brat, and I will let you enjoy the rest of your life in peace,” he said. He appeared very generous, but he knew that there were not many days left for the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, and that was why he had spoken in this manner.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le smirked coldly. “Jiuwu, you are truly shameless! For the sake of your own transcendance, you have set aside all the living creatures of the entire Celestial Realm, and you can still bring yourself to stand in front of me?”

“Are you courting death?” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate asked menacingly. “You only have about 100 years to live, at most. I do not mind sending you earlier on your way.”

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed loudly. “That’s right. There is indeed not much time left for me, but it is no issue to drag another person down with me before I die. Do you wish to die with me?”

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was disdainful. “You are already at the end of your line; what right do you have to bring me down with you? You have no measure of your own abilities!”

Xiu, as he spoke, various colorful clouds flashed repeatedly in the skies, and a great many people appeared around them.

They were all Celestial Kings!

They naturally had sensed the abnormal fluctuation in the energy storm, and had come to investigate the matter, but how could a Ninth Heaven Celestial King possibly compare to a Heavenly Venerate in speed?

There were really quite a number of people there: Eternity Celestial King, Everlasting Youth Celestial King, Treading Clouds Celestial King, Thousand Words Celestial King… as well as Shang Zhiwei! When these Celestial Kings spotted Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, they all looked incredibly stunned!

There was actually another Heavenly Venerate in the Celestial Realm!

“I will repeat it again. Hand over that disobedient brat, or you will have to die with him!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate issued the final warning.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was nonchalant. “If I went all out in battle, it would be no problem to drag you down with me. If you wish to die, I can oblige you.”

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate instantly frowned. Though he could tell that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s injuries were extremely severe, and he would not have long to live, exactly how much battle prowess he had left was still a question mark. The latter was a person that would definitely die. If he dragged him down with him, that would naturally be a great loss on his side.

“Hehe, we parted over a dozen epochs ago, my friend, and you do not seem to look too well!” A cold laugh rang out, and yet another supreme overlord arrived.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

“If I join forces with Friend Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate, do you still have the confidence to drag either one of us down with you?” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable asked.

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was still uncaring. “When the two of you are but a thought?” His face bore an expression of disdain, as if he could destroy these two powerful beings with a single strike.

“My real self will definitely arrive in less than an hour,” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate stated evenly.

“That applies to me as well.” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable looked coldly at Heavenly Venerate Wu Le. “My friend, you had best accept our kind offer.”

“Selfish guys, don’t talk of such nonsense with me!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was completely unmoved, bearing noble ideals as he pointed at the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable respectively. “Just bring it on, and I will take on the two of you!”
