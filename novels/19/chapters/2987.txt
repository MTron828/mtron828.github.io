2988 Shock

Over a million years later, Ling Han had finally arrived at the dimension on the 33rd level. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This was the last level a Heavenly Venerate would be able to reach. Beyond this point, the fundamental particles were extremely dense, reaching the point of forming a wall that not even a Seventh Tier would be able to pass.

Throughout all these years, Golden Silk Moth and Ling Han were locked in battle. Naturally, the former would not submit to Ling Han and become his servant or follower.

Even when he was a Sixth Tier, he wouldn’t be subordinate to a Seventh Tier, much less now that he was a Seventh Tier himself. This was the pride of a Heavenly Venerate.

However, Ling Han had also gathered many Great Herbs and increased his strength over the last few years. This made it progressively easier for him to suppress Golden Silk Moth. Originally, he would need to focus his attention on subduing Golden Silk Moth every few breaths or so, but now he could extend that time up to 30 minutes.

As the time grew longer, Golden Silk Moth gradually lost hope as he watched while Ling Han grew stronger by the day. Would he have to live the remainder of his eternal life in such a fashion?

Ling Han walked around this place, but it was clearly dug clean. There were no more veins of ore for him to mine.

He gave up trying to search for more veins. Instead, he wanted to venture deeper in and see how tough that supposed “wall” formed by fundamental particles was to cross.

Not to mention, with the fundamental particles solidified, would he be able to directly communicate with them and break through to the Sixth or Seventh Tier?

Whoosh! A figure quickly swooped in, revealing itself to be a beautiful woman.

Lin Youlian.

“Miss Lin.” Ling Han cupped his fists and greeted her. He had always had great respect and gratitude for the Lin Clan.

Even though Lin Youlian already possessed a Seventh Tier’s battle prowess, she didn’t have an air of arrogance at all. She curtsied towards Ling Han, and greeted, “Brother Ling!”

However, when her gaze fell upon the golden silk worm on Ling Han’s hand, she couldn’t help gasping in shock. “So the rumors were true. Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth really has been suppressed by you.”

Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth heard her words clearly, and felt deeply embarrassed. This was like joking about a balding head right to a monk’s face.

Ling Han smiled. “I plan to keep him as a pet.”

Lin Youlan was speechless. Ling Han was probably the only person who would do such a thing.

Lin Luo could do it too, but given a Seventh Tier’s indestructible body, Golden Silk Moth would eventually reach the peak of the Seventh Tier and match him in strength. How would Lin Luo suppress him then?

Lin Luo wasn’t afraid of that, but there were other people in the Lin Clan to think of as well. Not all of them were at the Seventh Tier, and not all of them were as bold.

Ling Han dared to do such a thing simply because the guy was quite a lunatic.

Lin Youlian didn’t speak much of it, since a deep resentment has already been born between them. Even if Ling Han was willing to let go of Golden Silk Moth now, would the latter just walk away and forget it ever happened?

The atmosphere was a little awkward at this point, with neither Ling Han or Lin Youlian saying anything as both of them couldn’t come up with a topic to discuss.

Whoosh! Another figure flew in.

This time, it was Wu Haoyang.

Ling Han nodded to him in greeting.

Wu Haoyang returned the gesture, but when he noticed Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth, his expression also quickly turned to shock, and he couldn’t look away.

Golden Silk Moth was exasperated. Was he, a Seventh Tier, some kind of display? With all these people casting curious gazes at him, how would he be able to face the public in the future?

“Hehe, Brother Ling is a bold one indeed!” Wu Haoyang shook his head in admiration.

“It’s nothing much,” Ling Han humbly replied. However, Lin Youlian and Wu Haoyang almost wanted to curse out loud. If this wasn’t anything much to him, then what was?

Whoosh! Another person flew over. It was Xin Qihu.

He nodded towards Lin Youlian and Wu Haoyang. Then, as his gaze swept across Ling Han, he stopped upon seeing the Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth.

Golden Silk Moth felt an urge to just kill himself, secretly praying that Xin Qihu wouldn’t comment on his plight.

“So the rumors were true…” Unfortunately, things didn’t turn out as Golden Silk Moth expected. Xin Qihu addressed the matter, inadvertently adding insult to Golden Silk Moth’s many emotional injuries.

Not long after, Feng Wuding also showed himself.

When he saw Ling Han, his first reaction was to turn around and leave.

After all, Ling Han had already told him that he would beat him up every time he saw him. Feng Wuding had not achieved a major breakthrough in strength yet, so he naturally didn’t want to antagonize Ling Han too much. Otherwise, he would just be putting himself through misery.

However, when he noticed Golden Silk Moth, he blurted out, “Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth, you really have fallen into Ling Han’s hands!”

“…” Golden Silk Moth.

Feng Wuding quickly stopped himself, and then barked at Ling Han, “I demand you release Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth immediately!”

“Why should I do what you say? Who do you think you are?” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It looks like you haven’t learned your lesson yet. How dare you shout in front of me?”

Feng Wuding was not acting rashly. He guessed that Ling Han would need to use a lot of his strength to suppress Golden Silk Moth. Hence, if Feng Wuding were to attack Ling Han now, the latter would no longer be able to suppress Golden Silk Moth. Should Golden Silk Moth be released, the two Seventh Tiers would be able to join forces and defeat Ling Han.

Feng Wuding had always been the one to run when faced against Ling Han. Now, it was time to turn the tables on Ling Han.

“Ling Han, you’ve gone too far!” Feng Wuding shouted as he immediately lunged forward.

Ling Han scoffed and punched out.

Peng! To save Golden Silk Moth, Feng Wuding decided to receive this attack head-on. However, under the tremendous pressure of Ling Han’s power, he was launched backwards, rolling on the ground like a gourd. He was no match for Ling Han at all.

He spat out blood. It was clear that the single strike had caused him tremendous injuries.

There was no helping it. He was not formally a Seventh Tier yet, and his body was not at the point of being indestructible.

Ling Han laughed. “I only need one hand to take care of you.”

To a Heavenly Venerate, it didn’t really matter in terms of battle prowess whether they were fighting with one hand or two. However, Ling Han was implying that he would be able to suppress Golden Silk Moth with one hand while simultaneously defeating Feng Wuding with the other, and that he would be able to do so with ease.

How insulting was that?

Feng Wuding was furious, but he had no words to refute that.

If he were a true Seventh Tier, he would be able to give Ling Han quite a bit of trouble. With an indestructible body, he could at least persist like an annoying bug. However, he was already suffering to the point of vomiting blood from a single strike as he was now. How would he be able to deal with Ling Han like this?

Before Ling Han would even relax his grip on suppressing Heavenly Venerate Golden Silk Moth, Feng Wuding would already be pummeled to death.

‘What should I do?’

He had already declared his stance. How would he be able to take it back now?

“Haha, arrogant bastard, how dare you hold a Seventh Tier hostage!” A mocking voice resounded as Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows showed himself, emanating his powerful Seventh-Tier aura.

Feng Wuding was overjoyed. He knew that Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows didn’t like Ling Han. His words now were also clearly meant to say that he was standing in opposition to Ling Han. With Ten Thousand Shadows’ support, Feng Wuding was confident they would be able to defeat Ling Han. After all, Ling Han still had another Seventh Tier in his hands.

Fighting three Seventh Tiers alone?

Not even an experienced Seventh Tier like Lin Luo would be so bold as to say that he could do such a thing, let alone Ling Han with his newfound Seventh Tier strength that was only slightly more powerful than Feng Wuding’s.

“Brother Ten Thousand Shadows, let us join forces and take down this treacherous bastard!” Feng Wuding said to Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows.

“Very well!” Ten Thousand Shadows nodded.
