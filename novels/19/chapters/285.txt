For Meng Mao Cai, he didn’t want to offend Zhu He Xin, but wished even less to see Cheng Fei Jun’s younger brother die in front of him; Cheng Fei Jun was a high level Black Grade alchemist with the chance to break through to Earth Grade. That was a true Big Boss at the Star Brilliance Palace Hall—if his life were to be made difficult by Cheng Fei Jun, who could he complain to?

So, the best option was to calm the two sides, and as for the results of the negotiations… none of his business!

It couldn’t be helped that he had an itch to scratch, hearing the movements he couldn’t help but walk outside to see the situation. Never did he think he would get involved in a conflict between two alchemists.

Cheng Kai Fu said self-importantly, “Alright, everyone sit down to talk!” Eventually, his older brother would be drawn out by the disturbance, and with a high level Black Grade alchemist’s support… suffice it to say that he sure wanted to see what other tricks Zhu He Xin could pull.

And without Zhu He Xin’s protection, then he naturally could do whatever he wanted with Ling Han.

He swore that he would definitely use the most vicious tortures on Ling Han.

“Young Master Han?” Zhu He Xin looked at Ling Han; with Ling Han here, he naturally had no turn in making decisions.

“Hiss!”

Seeing this scene, everyone gasped in astonishment, wondering just who Ling Han was that even a low level Black Grade alchemist had to act according to his mood. One had to know that alchemists were haughty—it was truly rare to see one so submissive.

Ling Han shook his head and said, “There’s nothing to say, just slaughter him!”

Cheng Kai Fu shivered out of fright. He wasn’t a pig or a sheep, how could one say slaughter and do so?

“Hehe, this friend, can’t you give me some face?” Another voice sounded, clear and bright as if it had some sort of magic, making people involuntarily feel as if they were intimate with him.

Shua , everyone’s gazes turned toward the end of the steps.

That was a man in his prime, commanding a dignified appearance. Around thirty years old or so, he was at the point where one’s vitality was the most vigorous. He was tall but not sturdy; his slender figure gave people a sense of fragility.

However, not a single person dared look down on him.

Because on his chest three silver badges hung awe-inspiringly.

A high level Black Grade alchemist!

“My respects to Master Cheng!” Everyone paid their respects one after another, even Meng Mao Cai half-kneeled as one in the Spiritual Ocean Tier really had no confidence in front of a high level Black Grade alchemist.

Zhu He Xin hesitated a little, but paid obeisance by cupping his hands in case the other party caught his neglect, taking the chance to attack his faults.

Now, only Ling Han and Hu Niu still stood without any intention of paying respects.

“Impudence!” Seeing the situation, someone wanted to boot-lick Cheng Fei Jun, immediately yelling at Ling Han. “Hurry up and kneel, there’s no tolerance for your disrespect in front of Master Cheng!”

Ling Han turned to see a mere medium level Yellow Grade alchemist. He paid him no attention, but looked at Cheng Fei Jun and said, “Why should I give you face?”

“Under these skies, there shouldn’t be a person who dares not to give me face,” Cheng Fei Jun said indifferently.

Pu!

Ling Han almost spurted a laughter, instantly coughing continuously—this big talk truly blew through the skies. However, a mere high level Black Grade alchemist… not to mention Heaven Grade or Earth Grade alchemists, even martial artists in the Heaven Tier and the Deity Transformation Tier had no need to give him any face.

Otherwise, he could kill Feng Yan right away and the Winter Moon Sect would have to give him face, right?

Seeing Ling Han’s soundless derision, everyone gasped in astonishment. Who didn’t know that Cheng Fei Jun spoiled Cheng Kai Fu to an extreme? No matter what Cheng Kai Fu did, it would be supported.

For example, the town’s entrance fee was increased under Cheng Fei Jun’s insistence for the sake of Cheng Kai Fu receiving a little bit more money. Moreover, it wasn’t as if people didn’t know just how fierce Cheng Kai Fu forced the prices down, but compared to the life or death of a few lowly peons, naturally no one wanted to offend a high level Black Grade alchemist.

This made Cheng Kai Fu more and more unbridled, but today… he seemed to have kicked an iron sheet.

“Let go of my brother immediately, or else!” Cheng Fei Jun lost his patience, revealing a threatening expression. Two Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators came forth, each one with grim expressions.

This was the Star Brilliance Palace Halls’ strongest force—taking care of a “small problem” from the Nine Nations of the Desolate North, it was naturally more than enough.

“Or else what? Kill me?” Ling Han smiled slightly, wiggling his finger. “You have no right to command me, as for threatening me, you have no right as well.”

“Stop spouting nonsense, let him go now, and I can be lenient, sparing your life!” Cheng Fei Jun said, holding back his temper. He lost both parents when he was young and lived interdependently with Cheng Kai Fu; thus, his younger brother was his only kin that he pledged to protect with his life.

For Cheng Kai Fu, he wouldn’t mind sparing Ling Han’s life, but harsh punishment had to be executed.

Ling Han laughed mischievously and said, “Like I said, you have no right to command me!” He flipped out with one hand, taking out a silver badge and placing it on his chest.

‘What!?’

Everyone was shocked. This was the Star Brilliance Palace Hall, where there were the most alchemists. Even if they weren’t alchemists themselves, having come in contact with alchemists often, they naturally knew what the bronze badge, the silver badge, and the gold badge represented.

One silver badge represented a low level Black Grade alchemist.

How was it possible!

This youngster didn’t even look twenty, but had already become a low level Black Grade alchemist; was this a joke? No, no, no, probably because of this, he dared not to give Cheng Fei Jun face.

A genius, a true genius; a teen low level alchemist was definitely a rare sight.

Cheng Fei Jun was also startled. He never would’ve thought that the other party could reveal such a trump card, making him feel slightly shocked. However, he immediately revealed a cold smile. If Ling Han was not an alchemist, it would’ve been all right, but once the status of an alchemist was revealed, then Ling Han had to listen to his orders.

“A low level Black Grade alchemist is certainly out of the ordinary, but in front of me, you can only obey with servility! I order you to immediately let go of my brother! Hmph, you wouldn’t be thinking of not respecting a high-level alchemist’s orders, right?” he said coldly.

The alchemy world had the same level rigidity. A high level alchemist’s order to a low level alchemist was like an imperial edict, definitely not to be disobeyed; otherwise, one would receive all other alchemists’ rejection and disdain.

“Like I said, you have no right to command me, what are you yelling for?” Ling Han waved his hands dismissively, appearing extremely impatient.

“Lord Qian, Lord Yang, take down this insolent one!” Cheng Fei Jun said to the two formidable Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators.

“Yes!” The two Spiritual Pedestal Tier’s nodded in a reserved manner. They wouldn’t go as far to boot-lick Cheng Fei Jun, but since they were hired by the Star Brilliance Palace Hall, they naturally had to do work for Star Brilliance Palace Hall.

Ling Han was only a low level Black Grade alchemist, but he disobeyed Cheng Fei Jun’s orders; they certainly had enough reason to intervene.

Seeing the two with intent of intervening, Ling Han laughed mischievously, and flipped his hand, another silver badge was placed on his chest.

Pu!

Quite a few people immediately spurted out, two? A medium level Black Grade alchemist? You’re freaking joking, right?

A sixteen or seventeen year-old medium level Black Grade alchemist?

‘My a*s, this is definitely fake!’
