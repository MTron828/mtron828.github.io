Chapter 2194: Buddha Son?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Yulan Fenghua was extremely astounded. The Eternity Tap was the ultimate technique of the Buddhist Sect!

The Buddhist Sect was a colossal force, and the founder of the sect, the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha, had long since disappeared without a trace. It was said that he had died, but his three disciples were still supporting the banner of the Buddhist Sect.

The three of them were all known as Buddha Kings, and two of the Buddha Kings had reached the height of the Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and the last was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, who was said to also have hopes of advancing into the Ninth Heaven.

Even the Imperial Void Sect would have to give some face to this kind of great sect.

Yulan Fenghua had also previously exchanged blows with a Buddha Son of the present generation. The latter’s amazing techniques were like a deluge of heavenly flowers, causing him to gasp in amazement, and think that this was an extraordinary genius that was withdrawn from worldly affairs, and could even compare with that freak from the Sealed Emotion Palace. And what stunned him the most at that time was the Eternity Tap move that the Buddha Son, Shi Chanzi, had used.

This tap made him know what gap lay between the two of them, and had been branded in his mind since. Every time he thought about it, he would shudder with fear.

The Eternity Tap was the true core secret technique of the Buddhist Sect. The might executed would be different depending on the user’s cultivation level. One would have to comprehend the Buddha Heart to be able to use it. Legend had it that the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha had once used the Eternity Tap to kill a Ninth Heaven Celestial King!

Yet now, this secret technique that would not be taught to outsiders was actually seen being used by Ji Wuming.

Could it be that the latter was an heir of the Buddhist Sect?

Impossible. The moment one joined the Buddhist Sect, all their hair would be removed. They were all bald, and there was not one that was like Ji Wuming now.

Boom, when this finger tapped towards him, the Six Samsara Realms all opened, evolving into the Six Samsara Realms of Reincarnation.

Yulan Fenghua was even more astounded. That was because while Ji Wuming’s present cultivation level was inferior to that of Shi Chanzi, but merely in terms of the level of mastery of Eternity Tap, it was actually Ji Wuming that was superior!

How was this possible?

Boom, it was still the Celestial Killer Spear that showed its might, sending out a frightening attack that canceled out the Eternity Tap.

“So what if you are a Buddha Son?” Yulan Fenghua laughed after faltering for a moment. The Eternity Tap was a great shadow in his heart, but now this tap was completely useless in front of him, which gave him a great feeling of satisfaction all of a sudden. “The two of you, I will send you to the afterlife today.”

Ling Han shook his head. “Ji Wuming, if there was a list for those I’m the most unwilling to die together with, you would definitely be ranked on top of my list.”

Yet Ji Wuming thought seriously for a moment, and finally said, “You can only be ranked fifth on mine.”

“There may come a day when we would die, but it would definitely not be today, and furthermore, definitely not in the hands of trash like you,” Ling Han said to Yulan Fenghua, his expression filled with disdain.

“Death is already at your doorstep, and you are still talking tough?” Yulan Fenghua was extremely furious. Brandishing the Celestial Killer Spear, he sent out an incredibly terrifying strike. At the same time, he was also rousing the Celestial Killer Spear, preparing to unleash a powerful attack that was harsh beyond compare.

Both Ling Han and Ji Wuming moved as fast as lightning, dodging the attack of the Celestial Killer Spear on one side, while also unleashing a counterattack so that they could speed up the exhaustion of the energy within the Celestial Killer Spear.

…When cultivators had completely worn themselves out in battle, they could ingest alchemical pills to recover their Origin Power, but there was no way a Pseudo-Celestial Tool could do the same.

Thus, Ling Han and Ji Wuming’s strategy was to expend the energy inside the Celestial Killer Spear. As long as it was fully expended, then the Celestial Killer Spear would only be a weapon that had been forged from SIx Stars Pseudo-Divine Metal.

This was a stupid method, but it could not be helped. Who asked the Celestial Killer Spear’s level to be too high?

Thankfully, it was the two of them. If it was any other Heaven Soul—to say nothing of Heaven Soul, even if it was a Fourth Secret or Fifth Secret elite—they would only be kneeling immediately in the face of the Celestial Killer Spear. Not only were Ling Han and Ji Wuming capable of contending with it, they could even possibly win. What else could be asked of them?

Yulan Fenghua naturally knew this as well. That was why he had begun his preparation for unleashing a powerful move, planning to take down both Ling Han and Ji Wuming in a single strike.

“World Destruction!” He had already accumulated enough power, and suddenly stabbed the Celestial Killer Spear strongly into the ground.?Boom, a golden light spread out, extending continuously in all directions, and wherever the golden light passed, the ground would immediately be turned into metal, reflecting a dazzling brilliance.

A chill immediately rose up in Ling Han. He felt that if he was touched by this golden light, then his body would instantly turn into metal. However, the Source Power of Metal in his body was exuding a strong intent, seemingly filled with longing for this energy.

Thinking so, he dismissed the idea of entering into the Black Tower.

The golden light swept past, and he was instantly turned into a golden statue, standing erect on the golden ground.

On the other side, the “卍” character once again appeared on Ji Wuming’s forehead, and his body was also shining brilliantly, as if the attack delivered by the Celestial Killer Spear had engulfed him ahead of time.

The golden light rippled over 50 km before finally stopping, and everything within this diameter had been turned golden, becoming a world of metal.

Yulan Fenghua pulled out the Celestial Killer Spear, suddenly laughing loudly. He had destroyed two powerful enemies in a single stroke, causing every pore on his body to open up, feeling extremely gratified and pleased.

However, his smile very soon disappeared. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The metallic aspect of Ling Han’s body was gradually retreating at a very fast pace. And Ji Wuming was even more astonishing. He directly walked out in that metallic body, as if he was a golden Buddha.

‘F*ck!’

Yulan Fenghua was so shocked that his eyes almost popped out of his head. He had unleashed a powerful move, but this was the result?

The two of them… were they really human?

Ling Han laughed. “This move is very comfortable, so just do it again.” He was not the one feeling the comfort, but rather the Source Power of Metal, which had swallowed the Regulations of Metal that had been shot out by the Celestial Killer Spear to nurture itself.

Again?

Yulan Fenghua shook his head internally. To say nothing of the fact that it was useless against Ji Wuming and Ling Han, and unleashing a second ‘World Destruction’ was equivalent to wasting energy, it was also impossible for him to do it again. That was because the Celestial Killer Spear could only unleash the ‘World Destruction’ once in a short period of time. The seals on the spear that had been activated with much difficulty had all dimmed, and now there were only a rare few that were still glowing, its might greatly reduced.

“Humph!” Ji Wuming stepped out of the state of Golden Buddha he was in, but his aura was not weakened in the slightest. Instead, it had become even more terrifying, with Demonic Qi surging to the heavens. It was as if he had suddenly turned from a great Buddha that would save the world into a demon master that was intent on destroying the world.

He charged towards Yulan Fenghua, sending out a palm strike, fierce flames billowing.

Ling Han was not reserved, either. He primarily used the Fists of Fury, and would occasionally use the Great Clash of Source Powers. As for the Divine Demon Sword, he did not summon it. This was still only a Four Stars Pseudo-Celestial Tool. If it clashed forcefully with the Celestial Killer Spear, it would only be broken.

Yulan Fenghua’s heart became colder and colder. Aside from having astonishing battle prowess, both Ji Wuming and Ling Han also had frighteningly strong defenses. Even if he was completely enjoying the upper hand, so what? There was no way that he could turn his upper hand into a victory.

Gritting his teeth, he suddenly twisted the spear, planning to cut out a path of blood.

“Inescapable Net!” With a wave of his right hand, Ji Wuming tossed out a large net that moved to enshroud Ji Wuming.

Yulan Fenghua humphed, and wielded his spear to pierce that gigantic net.

In his eyes, this large net would naturally immediately collapse with a strike of the Celestial Killer Spear, but the truth was completely contrary to his expectations. This piercing attack only caused the large net to slightly open a bit, but it did not break, possessing incredible elasticity and sturdiness.

Yulan Fenghua was involuntarily dumbstruck. This was the Celestial Killer Spear, and it actually could not pierce open this large net?

Meanwhile, Ji Wuming turned his head, and smiled at Ling Han. “I had initially prepared this for you.”

‘F*ck!’
