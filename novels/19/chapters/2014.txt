Chapter 2015: Danger

Previously, Ling Han had not managed to recall it, because those people from the Ancient Realm were too weak, and there was no possible comparison between the two.

It was only now that he felt some kind of strange change taking place in those two statues by the doors, transmitting an amazing power to the person inside the arena, and only then did realization dawn on him.

Clearly, everyone in the ancient castle was more covert when they borrowed power, or rather more proficient, and Ling Han was unable to sense it right until that newbie made an attempt just now, which finally allowed Ling Han to capture some traces of it.

This was a completely new system of cultivation, but was also a system of cultivation that Xiao Gu despised to the extreme. Ling Han did not know the people here, but he knew Xiao Gu, so he was naturally on Xiao Gu’s side.

Furthermore, the methods of Xiao Jun and his party practically could not be more evident.

...It was a pretense that they were asking them for a spar, while the truth was that they were showing off their own strength, and thus tempting all of them to cultivate that so-called technique with them.

There were indeed kind people in this world. This was a fact that Ling Han admitted, but was there anyone so kind that would take out his own cultivation technique to share with others, and furthermore, a group of complete strangers, strangers whose origins they had completely no idea about at that?

This Ling Han did not believe. No matter what, he did not believe it.

If something was too unusual, there had to be something off about it, and added with Xiao Gu’s dislike, he naturally was going to stir up trouble.

‘Aren’t you guys showing off your superior strength? Then, I will be the one to beat down on you people, and let’s see who’s stronger then.’

“This brother does not believe in our strength?” Xiao Jun asked calmly. “You should be in the Dividing Soul Tier, right?”

“Young Master Xiao, this person has no relation to us!”

“That’s right, we have drawn a clear dividing line between him and us a few days ago.”

“Please don’t allow him to be a reason for ruining our amicable relations.”

Those from Qin Wei’s side all clamored, fearing that Xiao Jun would suddenly change his mind, and say that he would not teach them the secret technique that could allow them to become powerful in an instant.

Meanwhile, Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I am presently at the late stage of Yang Soul.”

“In terms of cultivation level, you are a match for my junior brother...” Xiao Jun turned his head and looked at Luo He. “Junior Brother, you go and spar with this brother.”

“All right!” Luo He stepped out, and leaped into the arena.

Ling Han raised his clasped hands. In polite courtesies, he made no mistake, and made no mention at all of the fact that he had once seen this kind of cultivation system before. “I am Ling Han.”

“Brother Ling, please.” Luo He raised his clasped hands, seeming very humble, but there was a hint of contempt in his gaze.

Ling Han strode out, and did not use any kind of movement technique. He merely strode out rapidly, quickly approaching Luo He.

Luo He scoffed internally. His opponent was going to be serious right from the very first move, and make it a close-quarters battle? He was filled with utter and complete disdain for these people of the Celestial Realm. All the expressions on his face were merely an act.

‘See if I won’t beat you up with just a single punch!’

He raised his fist. Boom, with a wave, there was no light of Regulations, or a single flicker of any great dao seals, yet the attack carried an incredibly terrifying suppressive might.

This was a completely different system of cultivation.

Ling Han smiled faintly. ‘Who cares what system of cultivation you cultivate? In the end, it’s all down to battle prowess.’

He clenched his right hand into a fist, and then launched a punch.

Without any kind of technique, and without any kind of logic, it was just a simple forceful punch.

Peng!

The punch landed, and Luo He’s figure turned into a tiny black dot, crashing into the wall of the training ground. Thankfully, this place was deliberately used for the purpose of battle, and was a different space. Otherwise, he would definitely have caused great damage with his collision with the wall.

Even so, Luo He’s whole person had still sunk into the wall. He coughed continuously, his face astonishingly pale.

Hiss, complete silence fell. Everyone was looking at Ling Han with a stunned expression.

The people of the ancient castle were stunned because they were sure that they were invincible in a battle of equal cultivation levels. Even if they were a minor level weaker, they could still turn the situation around. But now? In a battle of equal cultivation levels, Luo He could not even withstand a single blow from Ling Han!

This was something they could not accept.

And those people on Qin Wei’s side were even more shocked.

They had spent a longer time with Ling Han, but all of them had thought he was just an ordinary Yang Soul Tier. Now that they had suddenly witnessed his true might, this was practically inconceivable to them.

A considerable number of people wanted to stomp and pound their chests in frustration. Previously, they had actually drawn a clear dividing line between themselves and Ling Han. It should be known that this man was a monarch tier!

What was a monarch tier? Only a prodigy that was destined to become a Celestial King could be called a monarch tier.

They were overwhelmed with regret. Previously, they had endured a calamity together, and this was the best chance for them to nurture a friendship, yet it was they themselves that had spoilt this completely.

Pigs, they really were as extraordinarily stupid as pigs.

“Brother Ling is indeed very strong.” Xiao Jun showed a hint of seriousness, withdrawing the contempt that had existed all this while in his eyes.

Being able to defeat Luo He with a single blow, this was powerful strength!

“Let me try.” He stepped out.

He was a minor level higher than Luo He, and could also defeat Luo He with a single strike. Otherwise, he definitely would not be asking for his own humiliation. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Come then,” Ling Han said calmly. His motive was very simple, and that was to make sure everyone knew that there was no need to believe in that so-called deity. The Dao of the Celestial Realm was also wide-ranging and profound, and was worth their diligent study.

Xiao Jun leaped into the arena, and assumed an offensive stance.

“Please!”

“Please!”

The two of them spoke at the same time, and then launched an offensive towards the other.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The moment they clashed, both released powerful moves, holding no reservations at all.

To Xiao Jun, he had to reestablish the powerful name and invincible reputation of the deity, so he naturally had to defeat Ling Han as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, Ling Han wanted to set things right. Similarly, he wished to defeat his opponent to show that he was right.

“Destroy this place if you can.” Small Tower suddenly piped up.

“En?” Ling Han paused.

He had indeed wanted to ruin Xiao Jun and his group’s conspiracy, but had not planned to destroy them.

“There are rules in the heaven and earth. This kind of completely different system of cultivation can be considered a challenge to or even a betrayal of the heaven and earth. And when there are many people who cultivate this kind of cultivation technique, it could even shake the Regulations of heaven and earth, causing this whole space to collapse,” Small Tower explained.

“That serious?” Ling Han frowned. At first, he purely wanted to cause trouble, but if it really involved the survival and continued existence of this space, then everyone had a duty to act.

He gave a ‘yi’, and asked, “The system of cultivation here should be the same as what we saw at the Ancient Realm. Why didn’t you say this at that time?”

“Are you an idiot?” Small Tower said in disdain. “At that time, just how much of my memory had recovered? How could I have possibly known this?”

Right, no matter what, it was in the right.

In any case, it was fine as long as Ling Han knew the proud Tower’s temper, and there was no need to take it to heart.

All right, then he’d just beat this guy up first.

Ling Han roared and unleashed his full battle prowess. Instantly, his power increased over tenfold.

...Just now, he had been distracted, and conversed with Small Tower. This naturally affected his battle prowess, and now once he was making an all-out effort, it was like he was a changed person.

Everyone watched with captivated eyes. Those who were weaker in strength could not even catch sight of the two fighters, what more distinguish which of the two of them had the upper hand at present.

But those who were passable in strength all showed expressions of shock.

Previously, it was Xiao Jun who had the upper hand, but later it was like Ling Han had been pumped full of adrenaline. All of a sudden, he had become indescribably strong, and it was he now that was beating down on Xiao Jun.

Meanwhile, Luo He’s and Lan Ruozhi’s expression were filled with disbelief. In their eyes, Xiao Jun was an invincible prodigy, yet now, even when he was at an advantage in terms of cultivation level, he was actually still incapable of restraining Ling Han. Instead, he had now fallen into a disadvantage.

Impossible! How could this be!
