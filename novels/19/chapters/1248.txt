Chapter 1249: Falling Out

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden only left Ling Han’s tent after a long time.

She learned about many of his secrets, though she still didn’t know about the existence of the Black Tower yet. There were far too many people here, and the environment was also too complicated and chaotic. Ling Han would wait until it was just the two of them before bringing her into the Black Tower.

Anyhow, one couldn’t easily leave the army after joining—they needed to earn merit points if they wanted to leave. Thus, the most important task right now was to fight against Netherworld enemies.

Moreover, the army placed a lot of stress on collectivism, so it would be useless even if he retrieved the Netherworld corpses from his Black Tower and handed them to her. If he did so, she would need to divide the corpses equally among everyone.

This was why the army was safe, yet accumulation of merit points was slow. The army didn’t promote individualism, promoting collectivism instead.

Thus, Ling Han needed to wait until the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden “retired” from the military before he could be together with her.

“Sister, what did he say?” Zhu Liyun asked nervously when she saw the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden return. There was a shy expression on her face.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t help but feel guilty.

Could she say that Ling Han had always been her man? Just that they had only reunited after 10,000 years? She had initially gone to deliver a love letter for her friend. In the end, however, she had ended up striking a relationship with her friend’s love interest.

“This...” She wasn’t sure what to say.

Zhu Liyun’s expression changed drastically, and she asked, “Did you hand the letter to Grandmaster Ling or not?”

“Big Sister Yun, he’s not suitable for you. It’s best that you forget about him!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said persuasively.

Zhu Liyun remained silent. She stared at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden for a moment before saying, “You didn’t fall in love with him, did you?”

This wasn’t incorrect. However, she had fallen in love with him a whopping 10,000 years before Zhu Liyun!

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t explain this, so she could only remain silent as she gazed at her friend.

“Good job, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, good job!” Zhu Liyun was infuriated, and she pointed at the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden before shouting, “B*tch, I treated you like a sister, yet this is how you repay me?! You even stooped as low as stealing your sister’s man! Why don’t you go die?”

Anger spread across the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s face, and she said, “To say nothing of whether I interfered or not, do you really think Ling Han would’ve definitely liked you?”

“Why not?” Zhu Liyun shouted. “I’m at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, and he’s merely a Level Four or Level Five alchemist. Truth be told, it’s actually he who is punching above his weight! However, even I’m not complaining about that, so what does he have to be dissatisfied about?”

‘Auntie, you’re truly narcissistic!’

Right now, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden naturally knew that Ling Han hadn’t been lying. He was genuinely a Level Eight alchemist. Thus, those at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier truly weren’t all that special before him. Their standing was at least a level below him.

‘Firstly, you’re not beautiful. Secondly, you’re already a middle-aged woman. Thirdly, your status is at least a level below him. So, what right do you have to say that Ling Han’s punching above his weight?’

Initially, she had felt guilty about not delivering the letter for Zhu Liyun. However, anger rose in her heart when she heard Zhu Liyun’s words, and her feeling of guilt vanished completely.

In any case, she had never owed Zhu Liyun anything.

“B*tch, our friendship is done!” Zhu Liyun flung her hands and left.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden shook her head. She was the only friend she had made in the Purple Moon Army. However, it was a pity that she couldn’t deal with any hitches.

Anyhow, Zhu Liyun obviously wouldn’t give up like this. She immediately went to visit Ling Han. Since the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden couldn’t deliver her feelings for her, she could only muster her courage to do so herself. In reality, she hadn’t been too shy to deliver the letter before. It was just that she had wanted to give Ling Han the impression that she was reserved.

However, how could Ling Han be interested in her?

Even a seductive beauty like Lin Yuqi hadn’t been able to move him. So, how could an ordinary-looking middle-aged woman appeal to him? More importantly, they didn’t know anything about each other, okay?

After suffering a polite yet firm rejection from Ling Han, Zhu Liyun returned to her tent with a dark expression on her face. There was venom in her voice as she said, “Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, I only became friends with you because of your beauty and the fact that you might have gotten into a relationship with some powerful figure. However, you actually stole my man!

“Humph! Since the Xie Clan is looking for you, I’ll give them some help!

“And that despicable man! He tried to sugarcoat his words, saying that he was already in love with another woman and that we were all unsuitable for him! Pei! Isn’t it simply because that b*tch is more beautiful than me?

“You dare to humiliate me like this? Humph! When the Xie Clan comes, I’ll get them to kill you along with that b*tch!

“You’re merely a Level Four or Level Five alchemist, yet you actually dare to act so arrogantly!

“Humph!”

She released a bird that was only the size of a bee. It was a hummingbird. Although it didn’t possess any offensive ability, its speed was incredibly quick. In fact, its speed was so quick that it was on par with Heavenly Body Tier elites’ speed. She had only managed to capture this hummingbird by luck. After giving it some training, it was now her messaging tool.

She was an experienced Sun Moon Tier elite, and with her merit points, she could have already retired from the military dozens of times over. However, she chose to remain in the Purple Moon Army. This was because staying in the army was much safer than venturing alone. Moreover, the steady income of merit points would allow her to purchase all kinds of alchemical pills, God Tools, and such.

When she had first arrived at the Two Realm Battlefield, she had merely been at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Now, however, she had already advanced to the consummate level. She had only been able to achieve this by exchanging her merit points for a large number of alchemical pills. Of course, her own talent couldn’t be discounted, either. Otherwise, just alchemical pills alone wouldn’t have helped her advance so rapidly.

After so many years in the Purple Moon Army, she had naturally formed her own network as well. Now that she had released her hummingbird, the Xie Clan would receive her news in no time. Within two months, members of the Xie Clan would appear here.

“Just you two wait!”

***

With Ling Han’s help, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s reputation in the Purple Moon Army increased by the day. Everyone became aware that Ling Han was only so generous because he was pursuing the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. He was giving them alchemical pills so they could help him convince her.

In the following few days, the Purple Moon Army came across Netherworld beings several times. Each time, they achieved victory. During these battles, Ling Han provided them with many Explosive Thunder Pills. Although such a pill could only increase their battle prowess by one star, having an entire brigade increase their battle prowess by one star was quite a terrifying notion.

However, their continuous victories also caught the attention of the Netherworld. In the end, the Netherworld deployed a powerful army to hunt them down. There were 50 members in this army, and each of them was at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

This was an unstoppable force, and the Purple Moon Army didn’t dare to battle them at all. They immediately chose to retreat.

The aim of their trip was to destroy some Netherworld beings and to find some Realm Spirit Stones. They had destroyed a fair number of enemies now, though they still had yet to find a single Realm Spirit Stone. This left everyone disappointed.

However, since they had already attracted the attention of more powerful elites, the brigade decided to return to the main encampment. They would venture out again after laying low for a while.

Since Ling Han couldn’t join the Purple Moon Army, he didn’t plan to follow them back. He would explore this area by himself. He had the safety of the Black Tower anyway, so the dangers of the Two Realm Battlefield were relatively insignificant to him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He wanted to kill more Netherworld beings and accumulate more merit points as doing so would allow him to obtain more Godly metal. Moreover, he would strike it rich if he managed to find some Realm Spirit Stones. Doing so would allow him to obtain an exorbitant amount of Godly metal.

Right now, elevating the quality of the Divine Demon Sword was of utmost importance to Ling Han, only below that of increasing his own strength.

He decided to venture into the depths of the Two Realm Battlefield and kill more Netherworld beings.
