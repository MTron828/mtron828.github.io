Chapter 3366: Birth

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Fortunately, Ling Han was completely immersed in his own world. Right now, to say nothing of the fact that there were only a few people arguing outside, even if there was an earthquake, he would not have any reaction.

Pa, pa, pa! He gradually entered a good state. More and more shackles in his body were broken and shattered, allowing his level of being to advance to a higher level.

Half a day later, the momentum finally ended.

Ling Han let out a long breath. He felt that his entire body was wet, and there was a black substance on his skin. It smelled extremely fishy.

This was a leap in his level of being, the impurities expelled from his body. “Yi!”

“Yo!”

Eldest Baby and Second Baby covered their noses and hid far away.

“Dad, you stink!”

The two children said in disdain at the same time.

There was clean water in the Essence Nurturing Gourd. Ling Han rinsed himself, and the stench instantly disappeared.

He was a Fifth Change now. Ling Han slightly released his own aura, and there was a diamond-like glow.

He revealed a smile. It was the right choice to come out this time.

If he cultivated hard by himself, perhaps he might not be able to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier after even a year, but now, he was confident that he could complete it within three months.

How could it be so fast?

Because martial arts had just begun to develop, the large-scale appearance of the Treasured Fruits of heaven and earth gave everyone the possibility to advance in a short period of time. Otherwise, if they had to rely on themselves to take one step at a time, their advancement would naturally be rather slow. Thus, he had to make use of this time to advance. Otherwise, when the ancient sites were all occupied by the various forces, it would be difficult to obtain Treasured Fruits in the future.

Ling Han took a look. He had used up seven Long Rainbow Fruits, and now he still had ten Treasured Fruits of Life. In addition, he still had four Glazed Flame Lotuses and many unripe Treasured Fruits.

Was this enough to help him reach the peak of Fifth Change?

Ling Han didn’t know. He first had a full meal, then brought the two children and the fat pig out to continue searching for Treasured Fruits.

Not only did Second Baby have clairvoyance, but she could also see through obstacles. It was too convenient to search for Treasured Fruits. There was no need to take wrong turns as he headed straight for his target.

Unfortunately, the huge Medicinal Garden actually didn’t have any ripe fruits, which made Ling Han very depressed.

If he could take control of this ancient site, he could slowly wait for the fruits to ripen. The key was that his individual strength was indeed powerful, but he had almost no subordinates to use. How could he occupy an ancient site?

Oh, with just two little babies and a little suckling pig?

If word got out, people would probably laugh to death.

Thus, regardless of whether the fruits were ripe or not, Ling Han went to pick the fruits first. If they were not ripe, the effect would only be weaker.

After picking all the Treasured Fruits, Ling Han did not waste any more time. He returned to the Gourd House and focused on cultivating, while waiting for the remaining five babies to “be born”.

Another day later, a yellow gourd fell.

Third Baby.

As expected, it was still a little girl. She was shockingly beautiful, but she was incomparably proud. She was clearly using her eyes to hook onto Ling Han, asking for a hug, but she did not make a sound.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh, and reached out to pick up Third Baby. “Hmph, since you’re my father, I’ll let you hug me,” Third Baby said, looking very reluctant.

“What’s your specialty, Third?” Ling Han asked.

“Hmph!” Third Baby turned her head, as if she was too lazy to answer. After a while, she said, “My body is like an indestructible diamond.”

Ling Han exclaimed, and looked at the little pink pig. “Isn’t this the same as you?”

“Hmph!”

“Hmph hmph hmph!”

Unexpectedly, the fat pig and Third Baby snorted at the same time and looked at each other in disdain.

“You dare to scoff at me?” Third Baby was displeased.

“Come, beat it to death and let’s eat the roasted suckling pig!” Eldest Baby was energetic and directly rushed up to strangle the lecherous pig.

“Coo—” The lecherous pig let out a miserable cry.

“That’s its weakness.” Second Baby activated her ocular skill and pointed out where the perverted pig’s defense was relatively weak.

Alright!” Eldest Baby gathered black energy and punched the fat pig.

The fat pig screamed. Although its body was not damaged, it could still feel the pam. Eldest Baby triggered the black energy, making it truly feel the pain.

“Heehee!”

“Haha!”

Eldest Baby and Second Baby laughed loudly, while Third Baby was very reserved and looked disdainful.

Ling Han had a headache. Right now, these three babies already felt like little overlords. What would happen in the future?

However, since they were fighting the lecherous pig, there was no need to worry. He would not die anyway.

“Gu!” The lecherous pig let out a blood-curdling cry, and looked at Ling Han with small, sorrowful eyes. ’You f*cking left me in the lurch, you b*stard!’

In just two days, Ling Han had refined all the Treasured Fruits, but he was still a little short of reaching the peak stage of Fifth Change. He still needed at least 10 days of hard cultivation.

He waited patiently. He could also improve his Body Art. In any case, it was impossible for him to break through to the Extreme Bone Tier before his physique reached the peak of the Blood Transformation Tier.

After so many days, not only did more and more people enter the ancient site, but there were also many people who had the ability to enter the Medicinal Garden. Many forces would nurture their own Formation Masters, which was very useful at times like this.

However, currently, there was still no Formation Master who could open the formation of the Gourd House. However, this was the only place in the Medicinal Garden where there was a formation. Everyone did not gain anything elsewhere, so they gathered here one after another.

At first, there was a conflict, but later on, they stopped fighting and joined forces to try to break the formation.

This formation was too difficult to crack. Even if they gathered the wisdom of several Formation Masters, it was impossible to crack it without twenty days to a month’s time.

The more difficult it was to break through, the more everyone looked forward to it. It was because back then, they placed so much importance on this place that they sealed it off with a formation. There were definitely rare precious medicines hidden inside.

“Father, there are so many people outside.” Second Baby activated her eye technique and saw the situation outside through the walls.

“How many?” Ling Han asked.

“One, three, seven, six, five, nine…” The little girl began to count. If one hand was not enough, she would use two hands. If two hands were not enough, she would put her feet up. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Then, she also requisitioned Eldest Baby’s limbs. It was still not enough, but

Third Baby was too proud and did not allow her to use them.

The little girl fiddled with her fingers for a long time, then nibbled on one of her fingers. Finally, she drew a circle with both hands and concluded, “A lot!” Fine, he shouldn’t have any expectations for her.

It would be crazy to ask such a question.

Ling Han chuckled. This plan of teaching Second Baby how to count had to be put on the agenda.

“Father, let me destroy them!” Eldest Baby was filled with killing intent. The violent maniac had acted up again.

Lmg Han sighed, and said, “Don’t be anxious. Wait for the remaining gourds, no, the remaining five babies. F*ck, how come even I don’t know how to count anymore? When the remaining four babies are born, we’ll charge our way out in one go.”

It was true that one would be corrupted by one’s company. He actually didn’t know how to count after being led around by Second Baby?

Third Baby looked proud. It was just a few people. What was there to care about? She could rush out alone and settle it.

Two days later, Fourth Baby was born.

Yes, it was a girl.

Pa, just as Fourth Baby landed, another gourd fell. Fifth Baby had quickly followed..
