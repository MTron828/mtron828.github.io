Chapter 1797: Roc Palace? Celestial King Tier Sect!

Fu Dongxue drew a sharp breath. He had a feeling that things were about to get messy.

Han Luo had died in Separation Resentment City, a territory of the Fu Clan.

Regardless of what they said, the Fu Clan definitely couldn’t push the blame away from themselves. In fact, there was even a possibility that a full-scale conflict would erupt between them and the Han Clan.

However, what could Fu Dongxue say?

The female knight was a fifth secret elite, and he was as helpless as a measly ant before her.

‘Who in the world is Ling Han? How has he caught the attention of two three-star forces? In fact, he’s even led to the death of an Immortal Palace Tier elite!’

He hurriedly stepped forward and said, “Friend, I’ll go and investigate right away.” Unbeknownst to him, his voice had already softened considerably, and his expression had already become respectful and apprehensive.

This woman was a fifth secret elite! Even the Fu Clan only had one such elite!

As he flew back to Heaven Departing City, Fu Dongxue ordered his subordinates to investigate Ling Han and his whereabouts. At the same time, he notified the other mighty figures of the Fu Clan that a fifth secret elite had come. He was completely incapable of dealing with her. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It wasn’t long before many powerful elites arrived. They proudly stood in the sky, with some of them completely visible, some of them shrouded in mists of chaos, and some of them shrouded in auras of the great dao.

There were nine elites in total, and they were the only nine Immortal Palace Tier elites of the Fu Clan. Moreover, Fu Shenbing, the most powerful elite of the Fu Clan, was also present among them. He was surrounded and protected by the other elites, and judging from his appearance, he only looked to be around 30 years old. In fact, this was after he had purposefully made himself appear older. Otherwise, he would only look to be around 20 years old.

Right now, Fu Shenbing was observing the female knight. This woman seemed profound and mysterious, and if they were to do battle, he wouldn’t have any confidence in defeating her.

After a short while, they received a report with Ling Han’s information.

Expressions of astonishment spread across the nine powerful elites’ faces as they quickly scanned the report with their divine sense.

Ling Han’s actions were indeed fairly freakish. However, it still seemed to be a stretch that he could catch the attention of two Immortal Palace Tier elites. Moreover, the female knight had even killed Han Luo after a brief and seemingly trivial argument. Wasn’t she afraid of the Han Clan seeking revenge?

Strangely enough, they couldn’t determine the female knight’s background no matter what.

There was a fish-like yet also bird-like emblem[1] on the Dragonhawk’s saddle, and with their paucity of experience, they were completely unable to determine which force this emblem belonged to.

“My apologies, Ling Han has already entered the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm,” Fu Dongxue said after receiving a divine sense message from Fu Dongxue. He revealed the truth to the female knight. Moreover, his voice was loud and clear now that the old ancestor was standing beside him. He was filled with renewed confidence.

The female knight pondered for a moment before asking, “Where’s the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm located?”

Fu Shenbing finally opened his mouth, saying, “Friend, you want to head to the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm to find Ling Han?”

“Nonsense!” the female knight said without restraint. Were these people retards? Had she flown here from the Western Celestial Realm simply to have a cup of tea in their sh*tty little city?

“Impudence!” an elite of the Fu Clan roared in anger. This woman was far too audacious and wanton. Not only had she killed an elite at their doorstep, she was even disrespecting their old ancestor now! Did she truly think that the Fu Clan was an easy target?

Fu Shenbing was slightly displeased, and he said, “Friend, you’ve killed an Immortal Palace Tier elite of the Han Clan at the doorstep of my Fu Clan... Regarding this matter... you have to give me a satisfactory explanation. The Fu Clan can’t shoulder this responsibility for you!”

The female knight became even more impatient, and she said, “What Han Clan and Fu Clan... If you want an explanation, you’re welcome to come to the Roc Palace. My sect is willing to accept your challenge regardless of who you are!”

‘Roc Palace?’

The elites of the Fu Clan exchanged puzzled glances.

‘Is there such a force in the surroundings?

‘There definitely isn’t!’

To say nothing of three-star forces, such a force didn’t exist even among the four-star forces and five-star forces.

‘Gasp! This person isn’t an elite of the Qi Clan, right? Is she purposefully disguising herself as a member of the Roc Palace or whatnot to shift the blame to someone else? Does she want to incite a deadly conflict between the Han Clan and the Fu Clan?’

However, the likelihood of this was extremely low.

This was because the Qi Clan only had a single fifth secret elite, and this elite certainly wasn’t the female knight before them. One could disguise their appearance, but they couldn’t disguise the Regulations that they wielded. In other words, the elite of the Qi Clan and the female knight before them were two completely different people.

Moreover, it was extremely unlikely that she had calculated everything so precisely and come here at just the right moment to kill Han Luo.

This was most likely a coincidence.

‘Strange... What in the world is the Roc Palace?’

“Friend, why don’t you stay here for a few days? Anyhow, the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm has already opened, and it will remain open for at least 10 or so years,” Fu Shenbing said. He planned to immediately notify the Han Clan of the matters here, and when the members of the Han Clan arrived, it would be up to them how they dealt with the situation. In any case, this had nothing to do with the Fu Clan.

The female knight became even more impatient, and she said, “I’m asking you for the location of the Hidden Dragon Mystery Realm! I didn’t ask for your suggestions!”

“Friend, aren’t you perhaps taking things a little too far?” a third secret elite said. Their old ancestor was standing right beside them, so he was naturally unafraid.

“Bunch of fools! You’re asking for trouble!” the female knight said coldly. She raised her right hand.

Boom!

Regulations gathered, and the surroundings instantly transformed into a sea of water-element great dao.

Rumble...

A colossal fish that was as large as a mountain leaped out from the water, and crashed toward the nine powerful elites of the Fu Clan.

“Impudence!!” Fu Shenbing roared in fury. This woman was far too domineering and audacious! She had charged into the Fu Clan, and not only had she killed an elite of the Han Clan, but she was even attacking the elites of the Fu Clan now! Fu Shenbing was rendered completely speechless!

He immediately counterattacked, and the eight other Immortal Palace Tier elites also unleashed attacks of their own. This wasn’t a sparring session, but rather a battle of resistance to prevent the Fu Clan from being humiliated by an outsider. Thus, they naturally didn’t need to worry about bullying others with numbers.

The colossal fish surged over, causing water-element Regulations to suffuse the sky. After a while, the surroundings returned to a state of peace and tranquility.

The female knight was unfazed as she sat on her Dragonhawk, while the nine elites of the Fu Clan were disheveled and in a complete mess. Fu Shenbing was no exception, with his hair loose and his clothes drenched in blood.

The nine powerful elites were completely stunned. What kind of power was this?

So be it if the other elites had been suppressed. However, Fu Shenbing was a fifth secret elite! Moreover, he had also had the assistance of eight other Immortal Palace Tier elites. Yet, he had still been defeated in a single strike. Just how great was the gulf between their power?

Gasp! It was extremely likely that this woman wouldn’t need to spend much energy if she genuinely wanted to destroy the Fu Clan.

How could there exist such a powerful Immortal Palace Tier elite?

“O-old ancestor!” a youth who was standing beneath them stammered. He was extremely afraid, yet he still spoke to grab their attention.

The nine powerful elites were extremely displeased. What kind of time was this? Was this a time for some measly Genesis Tier cultivator to stick their nose in? However, they didn’t have the time or effort to scold this junior. After all, the female knight before them was far too terrifying.

“Old ancestor, I know about the existence of the Roc Palace,” the youth continued. Although he was scared to death, he knew that this was an extremely rare opportunity to speak to the nine grand elders. Having spoken to them, who in the Fu Clan would dare not to give him face in the future?

The nine elites finally paid attention to him. Fu Dongxue signaled with his eyes, and Fu Dongxue immediately understood his intentions. He hovered down and lifted the youth into midair before saying, “Speak!”

“Not long ago, Young Master Yun tasked me with investigating the whereabouts of the Roc Palace. After spending a huge amount of effort, I finally obtained some useful information from a merchant who travels the boundless seas. As it turns out, the Roc Palace is located in the Western Celestial Realm.”

Western Celestial Realm?

No wonder they had never heard of the Roc Palace before. To say nothing of the distance between the Eastern Celestial Realm and the Western Celestial Realm, even Celestial King Tier forces in the same continent would know very little about each other. After all, the Celestial Realm was unfathomable in size.

The youth paused for a moment before saying, “The Roc Palace... is a Celestial King Tier force!”

Pu!

The nine powerful elites of the Fu Clan immediately choked and spluttered upon hearing this. They broke into fits of coughing, and their expressions became as shocked and astounded as could be.
