Chapter 2331 Parting Ways

One after another, the teams entered the mystery realm. They didn’t need to worry about being attacked immediately upon entering, as the teams would all be randomly teleported away after entering the mystery realm. The chances of two teams being teleported to the exact same location were infinitesimally close to zero.

At the very least, Ling Han and the others didn’t suffer such misfortune. After entering the mystery realm, he began by surveying their surrounding environment.

“Newbies, stop looking around everywhere. Follow our lead,” Wu Ya and the others said. They had already participated in the Thousand Academy Tournament once, so they were naturally familiar with this mystery realm. As such, they didn’t need to observe the surroundings, and they immediately issued a command to Ling Han, the Empress, and the others.

In this place, competitors were forbidden from drawing on any external power. Thus, these people naturally regained their sense of superiority. So what if Ling Han was a monarch star? He was still trash because of his low and measly cultivation level.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I detest looking at you people. Let’s part ways here.”

“You…!!” Xun Feng and the others were all enraged. This was a team competition, so they could only perform to their full potential if they all combined their strength, yet Ling Han wanted to split from the team right from the get-go? If they came across enemies, wouldn’t they get easily picked off one by one?

“Ba, don’t be too arrogant!” Xun Feng couldn’t help but chide. “You can’t even rival us, let alone the countless other elites in this realm. In fact, there are no fewer than 50 people who are even more powerful than You Yuan. Do you really think you can defeat everyone?”

“Indeed,” Ling Han said with a nod. “I can’t help it; strength breeds confidence.”

Xun Feng and the others were about to explode in rage. They had never come across someone as shameless as Ling Han before. He was only at the Third Leaf of the Eighth Lotus, yet he still dared to harbor such unfounded confidence? Where was his sense of superiority coming from?

“See you in a month,” Ling Han said with a wave. He then left with the three women.

“Stop right there!” Wu Ya roared. He immediately lashed out, grabbing at Ling Han. He truly couldn’t endure this anymore. He was going to teach this audacious brat a lesson.

Ling Han didn’t turn around, and he simply snapped his fingers.

Whoosh!

A burst of Sword Qi slashed over, astonishing the heavens.

Pu!

A bloody gash instantly appeared on Wu Ya’s chest, so deep that even his bones were visible. One of his wings more so lost one-third of its feathers, with the latter dancing in the sky like white snow.

This strike seemingly froze time as well, with everyone rendered speechless as their mouth remained agape.

Wu Ya… was at the Seventh Leaf of the Eighth Lotus!

Even if one were a monarch star, if they weren’t at the same or even higher cultivation level, how could they defeat a monarch star like Wu Ya in a single strike?

Moreover, Ling Han was only at the Third Leaf of the Eighth Lotus!

No, no, no… He definitely wasn’t at the Third Leaf. If a Third Leaf cultivator were so ferocious, the entire system of cultivation would fall into disarray.

“Don’t seek death!” Ling Han said in a baleful voice. He was filled with animosity toward the Foreign Realm. If it weren’t for the fact that the Angel Race hadn’t invaded the Celestial Realm, and if it weren’t for the fact that there were Ancestral Kings watching over this competition to prevent competitors from killing each other, he might have truly failed to suppress his killing intent.

After all, Wu Ya had wanted to steal his women before, and he had even acted upon this impulse.

At this moment, even Xun Feng didn’t dare to interfere. This was because he couldn’t defeat Wu Ya in a single strike. In other words, Ling Han was even more powerful than him. Moreover, the Empress and Hu Niu were also monarch stars who possessed astounding battle prowess. If they truly did battle, they wouldn’t have any advantage at all.

In addition, such a battle would be completely meaningless. Thus, they naturally didn’t want to engage.

The five people felt deep powerlessness as they watched Ling Han and the others leave.

“If we can’t break into the top 100 this time, the responsibility lies squarely with them.”

“That’s right; it’s got nothing to do with us.”

The five people all spoke in disdain.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others were as relaxed as could be. There were two ways to obtain the beacons—the first way was to find the hidden beacons, and the second way was to snatch beacons from others.

The hidden beacons would all have obvious indications, such as bright and flashing lights. As long as one ventured within two kilometers of a hidden beacon, they would be able to discover it with ease. If one wanted to snatch beacons from others, however, this would be up to luck. Perhaps the victims would possess no beacons, either because they hadn’t started collecting them yet, or because they had only just been robbed by others. In that case, they would make no gains. “We have heaps of time. Let’s rest first,” Ling Han said. He was completely uninterested in searching for the hidden beacons. Instead, he had already decided long ago that he would snatch them from others. As such, he naturally couldn’t be bothered wasting his time to look for them now. Half a month’s time was likely enough for all of the hidden beacons to be discovered and collected. At that time, battles would break out, and those who were more powerful would naturally end up snatching more beacons.

Ling Han and the others found a lake, where they set up a tent to rest. They would cultivate for a while every day before enjoying some delicacies and relaxing. Their days were especially leisurely-apart from the fact that they still had zero beacons.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, there was a stone tablet that listed the current progress of every team. This stone tablet would refresh every two hours.

The entire mystery realm existed within a formation, so it was extremely easy to gather information about the teams inside.

Right now, the Eternal Dragon Academy wasn’t ranked first. Instead, it was the Excellence Order Academy that occupied this position, having obtained a total of 97 beacons. Meanwhile, the Eternal Dragon Academy was only ranked 17th.

However, no one was surprised about this. Firstly, the standings for the first round didn’t bear any great significance. The teams simply needed to make it into the top 100 to advance to the second round. Secondly, the competition had only just begun, so the more powerful teams naturally hadn’t made their moves yet. For example, the Firm Heaven Academy, which had placed second in the previous tournament, was only ranked 13th right now. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Opposite the stone tablet, there was also a large stone that was as smooth as a mirror. On its surface was a live stream of the mystery realm. However, this stream could only capture a small number of areas.

“Hurry, look over there! This youth has defeated another team!” someone exclaimed.

The spectators here were the elites who had accompanied the teams from their academies. They were mostly at the Ninth Lotus as Ancestral Kings clearly wouldn’t mingle with such crowds.

A Ninth Lotus elite clasped their head, and exclaimed, “Who is this youth? He’s far too powerful, no? He annihilated the entire team in under 10 breaths!”

He was clearly a junior at the Eighth Lotus, yet his battle prowess could easily rival that of Ninth Lotus elites.

“That’s Xu Xing, the greatest prodigy from my academy!” an elite said with pride. “Three Manifest Academy?” Everyone frowned upon hearing this. They all wore expressions of doubt.

In the previous Thousand Academy Tournament, the Three Manifest Academy had ranked outside the top 500. They had completely failed to make it into the second round. Now, however, after a measly one million years, they had actually produced such a terrifying prodigy? With just his power alone, he was able to defeat an entire team in a mere 10 breaths?

This was a monarch star!

“The world is truly ever-changing!” an elite remarked with emotion. “A monarch star was killed this time, yet another monarch star has risen to fill his place. The heavens are truly smiling down at us! Monarch stars are rising with no end, and now is the time for us to flourish!”

“Mm-hm!” Many people nodded in agreement. Only Qi Shuang and Yuan felt extremely vexed. After all, it was extremely likely that their academy couldn’t even break into the top 100 this time. How could they be in the mood to feel happy for others?

“And this woman from the Angel Race. She’s also extremely powerful.” They quickly discovered another rising star. This woman used her fingers like a sword, unleashing devastating bursts of Sword Qi that no one could rival. She advanced with no obstructions at all.

“Hehe, this is Jing Zhongyue from my Purple Flutter Academy,” an elite said with a chuckle. He wore a smug expression, and he said this before the others even had a chance to ask.
