Chapter 2041: Angered

Very arrogant.

To demand that each of them destroy one of their own divided souls, and Fu Yue was to stay behind too.

Stay behind for what? Naturally to be killed.

However, Ling Han and his party had seen this kind of situation quite frequently, and could not even be bothered to feel anger. In any case, they could directly crush them if they were unhappy, so what was the point of getting angry?

Fu Yue, on the other hand, could not keep his cool. He was a standard young master. It would only be others that would be following his lead obediently in the past, and when had he ever been disobeyed? And now not only was there someone that dared disrespect him, they even wanted his life.

How could this not make him angry?

“What arrogant words, are you all even qualified?” Fu Yue scoffed.

The young man in purple robes showed a prideful expression. “I, Long Butian, have never failed to honor the words that I have said.”

“Oh, then you’re going to make an exception today!” Fu Yue met him measure for measure.

“What are you people just standing around for? Quickly destroy your own divided soul, otherwise… your only fate is death!” The young man in purple, Long Butian, turned to look at Ling Han and the others, his eyes menacing, and the word “King” actually appeared on his forehead.

“Yi!” Hu Niu immediately felt very intrigued, and stared at that “King” on his forehead.

Meanwhile, Ling Han smilingly asked, “You all should not just listen to this person’s side of the story, right?” It was not that he feared these young men, but he had no wish to fight any meaningless battle, so he was willing to keep the peace.

He related the story of Guo Ming and his wife, adding no extra details, nor did he exclude anything.

When he was done, he smilingly said to these young men, “Everyone, do you still intend to stand up and appeal for justice for this trash?”

This!

Long Butian showed a hesitant expression. He was indeed a profligate young master, and had always been a tyrant himself. However, he was a man with limits, and the actions of Ruan Dongxiang made him feel disgraced.

“You’re pregnant, your whole family’s pregnant!” Right at this moment, Xiao Gu suddenly blurted out.

Instantly, Long Butian and the others all looked furious.

This was an extremely serious provocation, having insulted even their entire families.

Ling Han couldn’t help but turn to look at Fu Yue. These words from Xiao Gu were clearly copied from this guy.

Meanwhile, Fu Yue looked embarrassed.

Previously, he had advised Ling Han to keep a low profile, and stay away from trouble, but in the end, it was he that had become the trouble magnet. First, he had been targeted by Ruan Dongxiang, and now, because the words that he had once said were copied by Xiao Gu, it had led to another turn of events.

“You’re a pervert, your whole family are perverts.” Xiao Gu continued to copy.

This naturally had become fuel added to the fire, causing the rage of Long Butian and his group to burn inflame to the extreme.

Ling Han sighed. This Xiao Gu could have learnt to speak at any other time, yet he coincidentally had to choose this moment.

“In short, you are all trash!” Xiao Gu concluded finally, and even pointed at Long Butian and his party, his voice and expression on point.

“Hahahaha!” Hu Niu burst out into uproarious laughter.

“You’re courting death!” Long Butian was the first to move, and grabbed out at Xiao Gu.

Xiao Gu’s expression was completely puzzled, having absolutely no idea why the other would suddenly make a move on him.

What did he do?

And in the eyes of Long Butian and his party, this expression on Xiao Gu’s face was just asking to be beaten. You had clearly said such offending words, and you actually still had an expression as if you were wronged? Just how detestable would that have to be?

Long Butian humphed harshly, his fingers slightly stretched out, and the might increased further.

Ling Han moved, and?pa, this strike from Long Butian was sent back.

“Yi?”

“En?”

“Ya?”

Seeing this scene, the other five young men all looked astonished.

Though Long Butian was a spoiled young master, he was an incredibly strong young master, with Earth-Soul-level cultivation, and was an emperor tier as well. In theory, he should be invincible even in Heaven Soul, but Ling Han actually managed to withstand a blow from him. This was extremely shocking.

“So you do have some strength!” Long Butian humphed lightly, the fighting spirit in his eyes blazing.

Ling Han had stepped out on Xiao Gu’s behalf because he feared that Xiao Gu didn’t know his own strength, and would accidentally kill the other.

Though they were now on opposing sides, Ling Han did not think that there was any irresolvable hatred between them, and they had to battle each other to death.

“Monarch tier!” the young man in green robes said solemnly, his eyes bright.

His name was Du Shaojun. He was the leader of their group, and his natural talent in cultivation was also the highest. Not only had his cultivation level reached Earth Soul, he himself was also a monarch tier. Otherwise, he couldn’t possibly have been looked up to as leader by emperor tiers.

“Top-grade monarch tier!” he added further.

Ordinary monarch tiers would only be able to maintain invincibility with a gap of two levels, and with Ling Han’s cultivation level at Yang Soul, he could only be invincible even against Earth Soul. Yet Long Butian was an Earth-Soul-level emperor tier, which was enough to overcome any Heaven Soul.

Hence, as Ling Han was able to match Long Butian, he definitely had to be a top-grade monarch tier.

Ling Han fanned his hand. The exchange of blows with Long Butian caused his hand to feel slightly sore. It could not be helped. He was quite behind in terms of cultivation level. However, he had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and this kind of impact was no big deal for him.

He smiled, and said, “This friend of mine is a little blank. Don’t take his words to heart.”

They could see that.

Du Shaojun, Long Butian and the rest were not idiots. Instead, they were all prodigies, though they were just a little arrogant and overbearing. There was something clearly off with Xiao Gu, looking rather like a fool. There was indeed no need to descend to his level.

“Young Master Du, don’t be tricked by him. This person is most skilled at scheming!” Ruan Dongxiang hurriedly called out.

He was not one of Du Shaojun’s circle, and had only managed to mingle with them coincidentally, and just for a few days too. Thus, he was naturally worried that Du Shaojun would be convinced by Ling Han, and refuse to avenge him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Du Shaojun cast a cold stare at Ruan Dongxiang. One could know a person for a long time without understanding his true nature. He had not thought that this person who looked like a man of fine talent would actually have such an unbearable inner character. He had no wish to have this kind of trash become his follower.

However, he did not display this, and only said to Ling Han, “If you can take 100 moves from Butian, I will befriend you.”

Though Ling Han had just withstood a strike from Long Butian just now, Long Butian had not gone all out at the time, and there was still a gap of two minor levels between the two of them. Even a top-grade monarch tier would find it very difficult to make up for such a massive discrepancy in battle prowess.

And to take on 100 moves? Difficult!

Ling Han smiled slightly, and replied, “All right!”

Du Shaojun nodded, and was slightly admiring of Ling Han’s courage. Then, with a toss of his hand, a chessboard immediately appeared on the ground, “Enter into the board for a match then.”

Xiu, Long Butian was the first to leap in. HIs figure rapidly shrank in size, turning into a tiny dot on the chessboard.

This was a Spatial God Tool, just a slightly different kind.

Ling Han also leaped in, and stood opposite of Long Butian.

“I will not pull my punches!” Long Butian declared.

“All right!” Ling Han nodded, but he did not take it to heart. In the Dividing Soul Tier, the person who could wound him severely should not have been born yet. Perhaps, the only one was Ji Wuming, and he was a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King, so could not be considered according to the normal logic.

As for others, he could just ignore them.

“Watch out!” Long Butian stretched out a hand, his figure rising into the skies, with the word “King” glowing hotly on his forehead.

He said that he would not be pulling any punches, but because this was a spar, his killing intent had already dispelled. However, the attack was still harsh. The word “King” on his forehead exuded a stunning brilliance, surging with endless power and frightening battle prowess.

Ling Han released a battle cry, his hands balling into fists, and met the other in a head-on clash of force.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Not only was Ling Han a top-grade monarch tier, he also possessed four Source Powers of heaven and earth. Thus, his battle prowess had actually exceeded the range of monarch tiers—just see, what other monarch tier would possess four Source Powers?

To say nothing of four, there was none that even had one!
