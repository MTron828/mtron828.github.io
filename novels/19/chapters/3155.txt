3156 Provoked by the Yunmo Banner

Surrounded by the crowd was a young man who looked to be only in his twenties. He was dressed in a tight-fitting black suit, completely outlining his slender yet well-built figure.

A little bit behind him, there were two brawny men standing with their arms crossed over their chests. They were shirtless, and their arms were so thick that they could be compared to thighs.

Judging by the color of their clothes, these three people were clearly different from the others. They were all dressed in black.

These were the soldiers of Yunmo Banner.

Ling Han had previously found out that there were a total of four elite troops in the Huju City, and they were Xuanqing Banner, Dihuang Banner, Tianhuang Banner and Yunmo Banner. These four troops were on the same side, and there was also competition among themselves.

By the looks of it, Xuanqing Banner was the weakest of the four troops, whether it was in terms of overall strength or individual elites.

It could not be helped. The Xuanqing Banner had only been established in the last fifteen years, so in terms of background, it naturally could not compare to the other three teams. Furthermore, because the Banner Lord of the Xuanqing Banner was the only woman, in this world of martial arts where a man would have a greater advantage, they would naturally be viewed differently.

The four teams frequently challenged each other, and the one who was provoked the most was naturally Xuanqing Banner.

There was no other reason. They were too weak.

And now, Yunmo Banner had come to challenge them again.

The young man looked disdainfully at the surroundings, his eyes looking down on everyone. “Is there anyone who can fight? Haha, within Ten Meridians, I can give you an advantage one hand, and even if it is an Eleven Meridians, it is not impossible for me to fight them.”

“How arrogant!” someone from the Xuanqing Banner said through gritted teeth.

“Who will go up and deal with him?”

“Sigh, it can’t be helped. He’s Zhu Lang, and although he can’t be ranked in the top ten among the younger generation, he can at least be ranked in the top twenty. This kind of person would be the top prodigy of a city, and has a chance of entering the Imperial Capital in the future.”

“But how could it be that we would just stand by and watch him act audaciously?”

The people of Xuanqing Banner were all incredibly furious, but this kind of challenge was also very particular. A Ten Meridians naturally should be fighting against a Ten Meridians, and an Eleven Meridians should be placed against another Eleven Meridians. And now, a Ten Meridians had come from the Yunmo Banner. If Xuanqing Banner had to mobilize an Eleven Meridians or Twelve Meridians to deal with him, then there would be no need for them to exist in the future.

Moreover, Zhu Lang was indeed very powerful. No Eleven Meridians dared to say that they could firmly suppress him. If even an Eleven Meridians was defeated by him, then the whole Xuanqing Banner would lose face.

“Weak, truly weak!” Zhu Lang shook his head, and said, “The way I see it, there’s no need for the Xuanqing Banner to exist at all. Huju City only needs three banners.”

This mockery was enough to drive anyone crazy.

“Zhu Lang, let me battle you!” A young man jumped out and charged towards Zhu Lang.

Zhu Lang sneered, and merely shot out a palm strike. Peng, that young man was sent flying. Like a scarecrow, he flew out of the crowd, and landed heavily on the ground, coughing up blood continuously.

“Too weak!” he said coldly. “However, at least you still dare to attack. You’re not a coward, so cowardly that you don’t even have b@lls.”

“B@stard!” Another young man rushed out, but Zhu Lang merely shot out a kick. There was clearly still three meters between them, but the force of the kick had already reached him, and sent him flying.

He had unleashed his power three meters without any weakening of force. This was the standard of Eleven Meridians.

No wonder this person was so arrogant. He was a Ten Meridians who possessed the battle prowess of the peak stage of Eleven Meridians, so it did indeed qualify him to be as arrogant as this.

If a Twelve Meridians didn’t appear, who could compete with him?

Group battle?

Hehe, then Xuanqing Banner would never be able to raise their heads high again.

“There’s no need to fight such trash.” Zhu Lang shook his head, his expression filled with disdain. “Heh, in the huge Xuanqing Banner, aren’t there any that can fight?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Hahaha!” The two brawny men from Yunmo Banner behind him laughed loudly, similarly filled with disdain.

Everyone was extremely furious. A few more young people jumped out to accept the challenge, but they were all sent flying with a single move.

Among the Ten Meridians, there was really no one that could match Zhu Lang.

Zhang Honglang moved, wanting to charge out. He really couldn’t bear it any longer. Even if he was defeated, he would still fight.

However, he had just raised his foot, when he felt a heavy weight on his shoulder. A hand pressed down on him, preventing him from taking the second step.

He turned around to take a look. Wasn’t this their cheap deputy captain?

“You’re no match for him,” Ling Han said calmly.

Zhang Honglang raised a brow. So what if he wasn’t a match? How could it be that he would choose not to fight just because of that?

You coward, not only did you not dare to make a move, you did not even allow him to make a move either. You are definitely a coward.

“Coward, don’t stop me!” Zhang Honglang roared. However, no matter how much he struggled, he couldn’t move a single inch.

If he thought about this question carefully, he would definitely look shocked, but now that his anger had gone to his head, how could he still calm down to consider the problem?

Hearing this, the Xuanqing Banner warriors in the surroundings all glared angrily at Ling Han, their eyes filled with disdain.

What did they hate the most in the army?

Cowards!

It was inevitable that they would encounter incredibly powerful enemies. How could it be that they would retreat without a fight?

No, what was needed at this time and of the highest priority was to help one another and unite, but the moment someone became a deserter, they would be done for. It was very possible that the whole team would be defeated in an instant.

Hence, one after another, the young people rushed forwards fearlessly, knowing that they would definitely lose, and no one stepped forwards to stop them. This was for the sake of their pride, and for the sake of their glory.

Wasn’t this guy the deputy captain that had been newly promoted by the Banner Lord?

Was such a coward even worthy?

Just get lost.

“Hahaha!” Zhu Lang laughed loudly, and looked towards Ling Han and Zhang Honglang. “This is the smart move, but… this also allowed me to see clearly that the Xuanqing Banner are only cowards.”

The soldiers of the Xuanqing Banner were all howling in fury. This practically drove them mad with fury. To them, thier glory was their life, and was more important than their lives.

At this moment, their disdain for Ling Han was far greater than their hatred for Zhu Lang.

Ling Han sighed. Why were these people so rash?

He shook his head and said, “I’m your captain, so it’s not your turn to fight yet.” With a light wave of his hand, Zhang Honglang involuntarily retreated. Teng, teng, teng, he crashed backwards into the crowd.

Ling Han strode toward Zhu Lang.

“Haha, coward, you’ve been embarrassed by others, so you had no choice but to run out?” Zhu Lang sneered. “What I hate the most are cowards and spineless b@stards. Against people like you, I won’t send you flying with a single strike. Instead, I’ll slowly deal with you.”

Ling Han smiled calmly, “You speak too much nonsense!”

He shot forward like an arrow, then threw a heavy punch.

Boom! He didn’t use any techniques, and he just threw a simple punch.

“You’re overestimating yourself!” Zhu Lang sneered, and also threw a punch back at Ling Han.

Peng!

The two of them could release their power, and when there was a distance of nine meters between them, the power collided. Then, Zhu Lang’s expression changed drastically. It was as if the power he shot out had encountered a dam, and could not advance the slightest bit.

Then, the dam turned into a boundless wave that surged towards him.

Then, he was sent flying.

Just like those who had been sent flying by his strikes previously, he was sent flying out of the crowd. Then, he fell heavily onto the ground, coughing up blood continuously.

F*ck!
