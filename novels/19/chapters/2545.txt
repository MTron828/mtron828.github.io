Chapter 2546: Evolving further

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The whole group exchanged looks, and in the end, it was Xu Huan who said, “I’ll do it.”

He sat down cross-legged beside the stone tablet like an old monk sitting in meditation, not letting out the slightest bit of sound.

Everyone nodded. Actually, the person that was staying behind would have the easiest time, and would not have to do anything else.

Was that really the case?

Ling Han deliberately did not look at He Runhai, but rather had Wally record and analyze him. Wally had a unique method to achieve this.

After a while, Wally said, “According to my analysis of He Runhai’s micro-expressions, he smirked just now.”

He paused, and then asked, “Why is he smirking?”

He had indeed completed the analysis, but he did not know the reason for his results. The human heart was possibly something that he would never be able to understand.

Meanwhile, Ling Han nodded. “This guy must have concealed something that he did not tell us about.”

“Grandpa Dog is watching him!” the large black dog declared.

Wally was still confused. “Why is he smirking?”

Ling Han pondered for a moment, and then replied, “If you are stronger than your enemy, but your enemy has captured your beloved, forcing you to submit, or he would kill your lover, do you submit or not?”

“Of course not.” Wally shook his head. “This is the simplest kind of behavioral judgment. If I, too, lose my ability to fight, then both my lover and I will die. I have to ensure that I maintain my prime condition, and only then will it be possible to rescue my lover.”

“Your answer is very reasonable, but it is too reasonable.” Ling Han shook his head. “The reason why humans are humans, and not machines, is because we have emotions. When a villain is holding a blade to the neck of your beloved, a great many people would submit.”

Wally was speechless, and after a while, he asked, “Then what would you do?”

Ling Han laughed. “I will prevent this situation from happening, so there is no need for me to answer this question.”

“…Humans have another very bad habit, and that is escapism,” Wally mocked.

As they talked, they had already left the second area. They were still going in a clockwise direction, and arrived in front of the third area.

This area was filled with thunder and lightning, booming loudly and terrifying.

“We have to force our way through,” He Runhai said. “Fortunately, the might is only around the Fifth Heaven or so. We will be able to deal with it as long as we pay more attention.”

He had long since stowed away the battle flag, and strode into the area of lightning.?Clang, clang, clang.?It was like countless tribulations had been fused together as lightning bolts that were thousands of meters long struck down endlessly, carrying frightening might.

Everyone walked in one after another. Because of how terrifying heavenly tribulation could be, an instinctive feeling of tension rose up in all of them.

Fortunately, the power of the lightning was really as He Runhai had described, only limited to the Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier. To them, this was not too hard to deal with. Even if Ling Han, Ji Wuming, and the others were only at the Third Heaven, their battle prowess was too strong. Every single one of them was capable of battling a Fifth Heaven Celestial King.

The lightning struck very closely together, blasting towards them like heavenly spears and divine swords. Xiao Yingxiong and the others could face it easily, but Ling Han, Ji Wuming, and the other Third Heaven Celestial Kings would have to go all out to face this kind of power.

Thankfully, the higher the cultivation level, the higher the frequency of being struck by lightning, and it was the other way round for lower cultivation levels. Thus, Xiao Yingxiong and the others were not having a much easier time than Ling Han and the others. The only ones who were truly incredibly relaxed were the large black dog and the other Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Ling Han spread out his Intent Realm to battle these lightning bolts.

He had already walked out on his own path, and formed a unique Intent Realm. He had just not reached Great Accomplishment level yet, and now every battle was an opportunity for him to further perfect his Dao. The stronger his opponent was, the greater the improvement he could obtain.

This was what a prodigy was. Difficulties could not crush them, and they would only become stronger and stronger.

Peng!

Ling Han threw punches casually. It looked simple, but they were just enough to destroy the lightning without wasting the slightest bit of power.

“Yi!” Wally’s eyes were bright as he scanned Ling Han. He was an extremely unique existence. No lightning bolt aimed for him as he walked in this area of lightning, unless he was unlucky enough to have a bolt of lightning just happen to strike down where he was walking.

“What is it?” Ling Han asked casually.

Wally’s eyes flashed for a while, then stopped, and he answered, “A very long time ago, I have tested your Evolution Index. At the time, it was only 10. But now, your Evolution Index is as high as 11.94.”

Ling Han was also surprised. He knew that he would have a great improvement after breaking through to the Celestial King Tier, and his Evolution Index would definitely shoot up. Furthermore, the Empress and Hu Niu were clear proof of this. Initially, they were only Monarch Stars as well, yet now they had become supreme monarch stars.

Forming a perfect Celestial Seed that was unique to oneself was an evolution of their level of being.

But the further they progressed, the more difficult it was to evolve. For example, the Empress and Hu Niu could both have Evolution Index that broke through 11, but Ling Han’s improvement may only be 0.6, or 0.7, so it should not be enough to reach 12.

Could it be?

Previously, when he had fought the Imperial Void Celestial King, he had understood his own Dao, and that had even drawn out a heavenly tribulation of the Flaming Frost Realm. This had also caused his level of being to increase, and from there, his Evolution Index was endlessly close to 12.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel extremely curious. Just what level had his battle prowess reached by now?

If he went to barge through the Nine Deaths Formation again now, just what kind of accomplishments could he achieve?

“What, your Evolution Index has already reached 12 now, brat?” The large black dog got a shock. In the Celestial Realm, there was no such thing as Evolution Index and Vitality Index, but they were especially popular in medium-level dimensions, and even more so in high-level dimensions. It practically seemed like they would be replacing cultivation levels as a measure of strength.

After coming to the Flaming Frost Realm, the large black dog naturally knew what these two indices represented.

One whose Evolution Index was 12 definitely could become a Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han chuckled, and looked towards Huo Furong. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the beginning, his aptitude could not be considered all that excellent, but through his own effort, he had gradually become a king tier, emperor tier, and monarch tier, and slowly improved his level of being.

But it was said that Huo Furong had dazzled the world when she appeared. She had already claimed the praise of being the Number One Celestial before she had even advanced into the Celestial King Tier. She was truly the beloved child of the heavens.

He wondered who was stronger: he, a prodigy that had only developed later, or she, this beloved child of the heavens?

Previously, Huo Furong could suppress Ling Han in terms of Regulations, but now? Ling Han had truly gained the right to match her on the same level.

‘From the Heavenly Venerable Tier, is there any Evolution Index that has reached 13? Or rather, does every step forwards in the Heavenly Venerable Tier mean a super-evolution of one’s level of being?’

Clang, right when his thoughts were flying madly, another few bolts of lightning struck down on him.

Ling Han easily destroyed them, but it was slightly straining for the Empress. She had already summoned her Celestial Tool. Sword Qi dazzled brilliantly, and her battle prowess instantly soared.

The battle prowess of Celestial Kings could be considered completely different when they held a Celestial Tool and when they did not.

Both Ji Wuming and Huo Furong possessed Celestial Tools, and they naturally would not refrain from using them in such a critical situation. They, too, drew their Celestial Tools, resolving their respective dilemmas.

They forged onwards aggressively, and only two days later, they arrived at the end of this area.

“Yi!” They were all surprised because there was actually a giant seated on the stone tablet at the end. He was 30 meters tall, his whole body covered with blue lightning, which formed the shape of seals.

Though he was human in shape, he did not have any features. He did not have any distinguishing traits of any gender, either. It could only be said that he was a human-shaped figure.

“Hey, isn’t he afraid that his a*s would be violated if he sat like this?” The large black dog immediately laughed mischievously.

This lightning giant was seated on the stone tablet, but the stone tablet was long and tall, and it just so happened that it was in the crack of the giant’s butt.
