Chapter 1884: Giving In

“Holy Son!” Sun Dong called. He shuffled over, and there was venom in his eyes.

Lu Xianming glared at him, and said, “Don’t say anything else!” He needed to calm down by himself so that he could come up with a detailed plan.

“Understood,” Sun Dong said before hurriedly stepping back. A wicked smile tugged at the corners of his lips.

If Lu Xianming didn’t help him, how could Ling Han overcome this calamity?

He had beaten up Alchemist Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice, so how could he resolve this issue easily?

Heh...

Sun Dong chuckled in his mind, and the wicked smile on his face grew even wider. He could barely stop himself from bursting into wild laughter.

Elsewhere, Ou Kan and Qin Guyu were also engaged in a discussion with Lu Xianming’s subordinates. Ling Han’s sudden rise had completely ruined their plans. Perhaps Lu Xianming wasn’t their combined target anymore. In fact, they might even have to team up with Lu Xianming to deal with Ling Han first.

In the end, however, they decided to do nothing.

After all, Ling Han had beaten up Alchemy Apprentice Mo! With Alchemist Zi Cheng’s protective nature, would he let Ling Han off the hook?

Since Alchemist Zi Cheng was inevitably going to target Ling Han, was there any need for them to waste their time and effort? Moreover, if even Alchemist Zi Cheng failed to deal with Ling Han, would they be able to do any better?

Thus, they decided to stand back and observe the situation.

Not only them, but many forces in the city also halted their attempts to recruit Ling Han. They needed to observe whether Ling Han could overcome this huge challenge. If he couldn’t, their trying to recruit him would be nothing more than a waste of time and resources.

It was amid such an atmosphere that Ling Han went to the Alchemist Pavilion.

From the second level onward, there were no more inns in the Alchemy City. Those who could come here were either residents of the Alchemy City, or they possessed extremely unique status, and were directly hosted by the officials of this city. Thus, Ling Han had nowhere to reside even if he had money in his hands. That being the case, he could only go to the Alchemist Pavilion.

He was a One-Star Alchemist now, so he naturally had the right to stay in the Alchemist Pavilion. No one could shoo him away. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Upon seeing Ling Han arrive with numerous beautiful women, everyone in the Alchemist Pavilion wore different expressions.

Ling Han still dared to come here?

After overcoming their initial shock, most people turned their gazes to the Empress. Fortunately, she was wearing a veil to cover her face. Otherwise, her beauty would have definitely caused a huge commotion.

Ling Han smiled before dragging some random person over, and asking, “I’ve heard that alchemists can reside here, am I right?”

This person wore a bitter expression, and he felt as if he had been struck by great misfortune. There were so many people around, yet Ling Han had somehow grabbed him. What would he do if he was infected with Ling Han’s misfortune? However, he didn’t dare to ignore Ling Han’s questions. After all, Ling Han was fearless, and he had even beaten up Alchemy Apprentice Mo. How could a measly person like him resist?

“Y-yes,” he replied with a nod.

“Very well. What procedures are there? I’m going to stay here,” Ling Han said.

The alchemy chambers here all possessed the ability to speed up time. Moreover, he didn’t need to use Time Cultivation Chambers for cultivation, so using the alchemy chambers here would save him a large amount of money. As such, he decided to refine alchemical pills here.

The unfortunate man had no option but to follow Ling Han’s command. He was only a beginner trainee, so he could only act subserviently before Ling Han. However, his expression was as bitter as a bitter melon.

Everyone was astonished upon seeing this. Ling Han had only just beaten up Alchemy Apprentice Mo, yet he already dared to boldly enter the Alchemist Pavilion? Where had his courage come from?

However, this made sense. If he hadn’t been so wanton, would he have dared to beat up Alchemy Apprentice Mo?

Ling Han had only just settled down when he saw Alchemy Apprentice Mo arrive.

“Ling Han, get the f*ck over here!”

Ling Han walked out of his room, only to see the furious Alchemy Apprentice Mo. His expression was as if he weren’t afraid of him. Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and say, “What’s wrong? That beating wasn’t satisfying enough? Have you come for more?”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s face involuntarily flushed red. His previous encounter with Ling Han had been utter humiliation! He humphed, and said, “Wipe that smug smile off your face. I’ve come here at the order of Grandmaster Zi Cheng. I’m taking you over to accept your punishment!”

‘As expected!’

Everyone nodded in their minds. Alchemist Zi Cheng was renowned for his protective personality, and it was also because of this that Alchemy Apprentice Mo dared to act so brashly. If things could be resolved easily, how would everyone be so apprehensive of Alchemy Apprentice Mo?

“Oh, so you’ve come on a fabricated command again?” Ling Han said. “Since this is Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s command, why don’t you show me his personally written orders?”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo faltered upon hearing this. Where would he get a personally written order from?

Who in the Alchemy City didn’t recognize him? He was Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s alchemy apprentice! As such, his words represented Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s will. It was also because of this that he could sometimes fabricate commands to target whomever he wanted. Of course, he didn’t dare to take things too far.

In any case, he had indeed come here at the order of Grandmaster Zi Cheng. Moreover, his task was indeed to take Ling Han over. However, Grandmaster Zi Cheng hadn’t said that he was going to punish Ling Han. Alchemy Apprentice Mo had added this in himself. In his eyes, Grandmaster Zi Cheng was so fond of him, so was he not calling Ling Han over to punish him?

Anyhow, he genuinely didn’t have a personally written order!

“You actually dare to question me?” Alchemy Apprentice Mo said in anger. He was truly aggrieved this time, and this left him feeling extremely unhappy.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m a One-Star Alchemist, while you’re nothing but a measly alchemy apprentice. Why can’t I question you? Moreover, the level hierarchy of alchemists is extremely strict. Is a measly alchemy apprentice like you worthy of giving me commands? Who’s given you such courage? By the looks of it, you’re asking for another beating.”

“You dare?!” Alchemy Apprentice Mo cried in a shrill voice. However, he involuntarily stepped back as he spoke. He was truly afraid of Ling Han. In the past, who had ever dared to beat him up? Not long ago, however, he had suffered a beating at the hands of Ling Han. This was naturally fresh in his mind.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “If you’re not feeling guilty, why are you retreating?”

‘Why am I retreating? It’s naturally because you’re frightening me!’

However, Alchemy Apprentice Mo couldn’t say this directly. After all, saying this would make him appear extremely weak. He straightened his neck and mustered his courage before saying, “I won’t argue with a barbarian like you anymore. Grandmaster Zi Cheng has ordered you to immediately go over! If you ignore this command... you’ll have to suffer the consequences yourself!”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo was using Alchemist Zi Cheng’s name to pressure Ling Han. After all, a Four-Star Alchemist enjoyed the same status as a Celestial King. Who dared to ignore them?

However, Ling Han refused to budge, and he said, “Oh, I only know about a fabricated command! Moreover, if someone fails their task twice, I wonder what’s going to happen to them?”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo’s expression involuntarily changed. Grandmaster Zi Cheng was protective of him, but this didn’t mean that he could truly act as he wanted.

If he failed to carry out Alchemist Zi Cheng’s orders twice in a row, Ling Han would naturally suffer a miserable fate. However, would he be any better off? He wasn’t a mighty figure, and his position wasn’t irreplaceable.

He caught a breath before saying, “Ling Han, I’m not issuing a fake order. The grandmaster truly commanded me to take you over.” His attitude was no longer overbearing and aggressive.

Right now, his priority was to trick Ling Han into entering the fifth level. Once he arrived there, he would naturally be at the mercy of Alchemist Zi Cheng.

However, Alchemist Zi Cheng hadn’t ordered him to forcefully capture Ling Han, so how could he dare to do so? He could reinterpret Alchemist Zi Cheng’s words to some extent, but he definitely didn’t dare to fabricate them. This was a rule that he abided by.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “A mere verbal statement is no guarantee. I don’t believe you!”

Alchemy Apprentice Mo was almost driven nuts. How was Ling Han so unreasonable? He hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth, and saying, “Then how can I convince you to follow me?”

Everyone was astonished upon hearing this. It was clear that Alchemy Apprentice Mo had given in.

He was actually yielding to Ling Han!

What a detestable person! If they treated him respectfully, he would become increasingly arrogant and wanton. However, after being beaten up by Ling Han, he had actually become so obedient?

‘F*ck!’
