Chapter 1907: The place of achieving dao of Celestial King Tier

Ling Han was a very restless person.

He had a very strong interest in alchemy, but was also very interested in cultivation. For the time being, the problem was that he had encountered a great dilemma in cultivation. Fifth severance was definitely not something attained through thinking hard.

Yan Xianlu had invited all the prodigies of the world so they could study cultivation together. There was definitely no shortage of top-tier prodigies among them. If he could spar with these people, Ling Han was sure that it should be of great help to his breaking through to the fifth severance.

Furthermore, Yan Xianlu was definitely a fifth severance. If he could spar with him head-on, it would definitely help him to analyze the profound mysteries of fifth severance.

Thus, he was definitely going to keep this appointment.

At present, alchemy was only his interest, and cultivation was what truly determined his fate.

He had not forgotten Small Tower’s and the large black dog’s worries about the future. In the future, there would be frighteningly powerful enemies. To say nothing of standing against them, just to know who this powerful enemy was, he still had to reach Celestial King Tier first.

When a Holy Son, and furthermore, one that was to be the future chairperson, set out, it naturally was not something casual.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng had initially wanted to send out a warship for Ling Han, but was met with refusal from Ling Han. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The warship was too huge a target. Even if it was of Four-Star level, and could suppress all Immortal Palace Tiers, the result was extremely hard to determine against Ascending Origin Tier. Furthermore, there were Celestial King Tiers among the people that Ling Han had offended. What if the Thundercloud Celestial King or Purple River Celestial King made a move on Ling Han on a sudden whim?

It was best to keep a lower profile.

Furthermore, without any attendants or any warship, Ling Han could enter into the Black Tower whenever he liked. He did not need to hide from anyone.

“Lord Holy Son, can you take me with you so I can gain some experience?” Bewitching Maiden Rou approached, her face bearing a fawning smile.

Ling Han was becoming better and better as time passed. Furthermore, he was a sure bet to become the future chairperson of Alchemy City. This position was too important, and he could just about decide the flow of alchemical pills in the entire Eastern Celestial Realm.

Hence, she definitely had to cling on tight to Ling Han. Whether the Purity Sect would be able to keep the structure of a three-star force in the future and reach four stars was all dependent on her now.

Ling Han put on a fake smile. This Bewitching Maiden’s smile was too false. He could tell with a single glance that she was just doing it for show.

‘Please, aren’t you begging me now?’

“Fine then. As long as you attend my husband’s bed tonight, we’ll bring you along,” the Empress interrupted.

“Sister, you are teasing me again!” By now, Bewitching Maiden Rou had also gained some strength to resist in front of the Empress. “In front of Sister’s exquisite beauty, I feel inferior. How could I dare to claim a connection with Lord Holy Son.”

“Heh.” The Empress smirked coldly, gripped Bewitching Maiden Rou’s chin, and said, “You either obediently become a member of the Ling Clan, or stop thinking of any other ideas.”

“Sister!” Bewitching Maiden Rou put on a display of being pitiful.

The Empress was unmoved. It was useless to be pretentious in front of her. Aside from Ling Han, she cared nothing for anyone in this world. Wasn’t it a joke to want to gain her sympathy?

Bewitching Maiden Rou, having courted a rebuff, could only develop sisterly relations with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and it was unknown what tricks she had played, but she actually really had the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden treat her like a sister, and she also managed to shamelessly follow the three of them.

‘You see, I only wish to stay together with my dear sister.’

Ling Han and his group left very quietly. Perhaps Lu Xianming and Qin Guyu were not willing to resign themselves to reality. They only had to send out some information that Ling Han had left Alchemy City, and there would definitely be a great many people that wished to take Ling Han’s life.

For example, Ba Yao. He could tell that Ling Han had hidden some kind of treasure, and definitely would not be willing to give up easily.

Inside Alchemy City, there was still Grandmaster Zi Cheng suppressing him, but if Ling Han was left alone, who else would be able to intimidate him?

And there was also the Old Demon Blood Shadow. He had initially planned to wait 10,000,000 years, but who would have imagined that Ling Han would only need a mere five years’ time to become the future chairperson of Alchemy City. He definitely would come to seek Ling Han out, and demand the Natural Peach Seal.

It could not be helped. Who asked that Ling Han’s present strength to be too low?

Grandmaster Zi Cheng had advised Ling Han before to obediently stay in Alchemy City as he was sure that no one would dare make a move on him here, but how could Ling Han possibly obey? The reason he had stepped on the path of cultivation was so he could grasp his own fate. How could he be willing to hide in a single place and be protected by others?

The four of them left Alchemy City quietly, heading all the way to Broken Clouds Mountain.

Their destination was 180,000 miles away from Alchemy City. It was of course impossible that Ling Han and his group would be walking there on foot. Very quickly, they boarded a massive ship to travel on it.

Broken Clouds Mountain was in the territory of the Eternal Prosperity Sect, and not only was the Eternal Prosperity Sect a Celestial King Tier-level great sect, the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King himself was a frightening existence of Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier. The territory under the reign of the Eternal Prosperity Sect was astonishingly colossal.

To say nothing of this trip needing a very long period of time, even if they had entered into the Eternal Prosperity Sect, the trip to Broken Clouds Mountain would also need a considerably large amount of time.

The Celestial Realm was too huge, and Celestial beings had unlimited lifespan, so there would not be anyone grumbling about wasting so much time on traveling.

Four months later, Ling Han and his group finally entered into the territory of the Eternal Prosperity Sect. They did not immediately disembark from the ship, but rather traveled another dozen-plus days, and then disembarked. At this time, there was only about a seven days’ trip by foot to Broken Clouds Mountain.

This time naturally pertained to Severing Mundane Tiers. Dividing Soul Tier elites naturally did not need such a long time.

The Eternal Prosperity Sect, prosperous for all ages.

The Eternal Prosperity Celestial King was a supreme elite that had already existed since at least an epoch ago. Wherever his name had spread, it was completely peaceful.

In this vast area, there was not a single criminal or mountain bandit. A single thought from a Celestial King, and he could send out doppelgangers of his divine sense in various places all around the world. Below Celestial King Tier, there was no one that could match him.

Hence, this area was naturally completely clean and crime-free.

Here, there were extraordinarily beautiful mountains and rivers that could be seen everywhere. Some peaks were floating in midair due to some mysterious force, and they were indescribably majestic.

There was no difference of night and day in the Celestial Realm, but the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King had used a powerful technique to create a sun, differentiating day and night. Just like his great name, wherever the sun shone, his power could reach.

A few days later, Ling Han and his group arrived at a massive range of mountains.

And this was Broken Clouds Mountain.

It had the word “broken” in its name, not because this was a low mountain range, or they had broken in half, but rather because they were too tall, so tall that they had broken the clouds in the skies, and that was why they were called Broken Clouds Mountains.

There were about 100 such peaks, and the one that Ling Han and his group wanted to go to was Three Yang Peak.

Three Yang Peak was not the highest mountain peak in the Broken Clouds Mountains, but was the most famous. That was because this was where the Eternal Prosperity Celestial King had taken the last step and become a Celestial King. It had an unmatched historical significance.

When a Celestial King was born, he naturally left behind his immortal aura here. If one comprehended Dao here, he might not be enlightened and achieve dao himself, but there still had to be some benefits.

But the Eternal Prosperity Sect did not establish this place as private property, forbidding outsiders from entering. On the other hand, everyone could come here, but the prerequisite was that they would have to be worthy of ascending the mountain.

...Where a Celestial King achieved dao, it was inevitable that it would affect the channeling of heaven and earth. Three Yang Peak was naturally not a peak that everyone could climb. It was said that only true king tiers could be worthy of getting approval from heaven and earth, and ascend this holy land of achieving dao.

Ling Han had found out this information in a city before entering into the mountains, and couldn’t help but feel very interested. The place where a Celestial King had achieved dao, what kind of amazing traits would it have?
