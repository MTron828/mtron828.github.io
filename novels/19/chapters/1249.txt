Chapter 1250: Netherworld King Tier

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The old ginseng and Rabbit both supported Ling Han’s decision to venture deeper into the Two Realm Battlefield. After all, they still hoped that he would pummel some Netherworld elites and exact revenge for them.

By and large, there were only Mountain River Tier and Sun Moon Tier cultivators in this Two Realm Battlefield. Elites at the Heavenly Body Tier would rarely ever appear. Once they appeared, it would signify an elevation in the severity of the battle.

Although there was an ongoing conflict between the two realms, a large-scale war hadn’t erupted for many years. All the conflicts were cautiously confined to controllable areas.

Moreover, it was relatively dangerous to venture deep into the enemy’s territory, whether one was an Immortal Realm elite or a Netherworld elite. This was due to the starkly different Regulations of heaven and earth—when in enemy territory, one’s battle prowess would fall significantly.

Under a different set of Regulations, one would only be able to use their power and not their Regulations. In fact, even one’s power might be suppressed. Not only that, but the higher one’s cultivation, the more severe the suppression.

Take, for example, Ling Han. His power was incredible, yet due to his cultivation level, he wasn’t able to comprehend higher-level Regulations. Thus, even though his power surpassed six stars, his battle prowess could only surpass six stars as well.

If his opponent possessed a power similar to his, yet they were able to grasp higher-level Regulations, they would be able to make up for any shortcomings in their martial arts techniques. In fact, they would even be able to use their martial arts techniques to suppress him.

After all, power was only one part of battle prowess.

If an Immortal Realm elite at the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier went to the Netherworld, perhaps their battle prowess would fall to the medium extreme, or even low extreme. This would be incredibly dangerous.

As a result, the elites of both realms didn’t dare to act wantonly. Usually, they would just guard their own side of the Two Realm Passageway—if an enemy elite dared to go over, they would simply kill them, easy and enjoyable.

However, Ling Han’s strong suit was his power, and his cultivation level was also relatively low. Thus, the suppression of the Netherworld Regulations wasn’t especially evident on him. In other words, he would barely be affected even if he ventured into the Netherworld.

Moreover, he had refined the Demonic Power Source of a Demon Master. Although it had only been a small amount, Demon Masters were the most powerful beings of the Netherworld. As long as he circulated this Demonic Qi, he naturally wouldn’t be suppressed by the Regulations of the Netherworld.

This was an extremely important advantage.

Ling Han wandered through the Two Realm Battlefield and familiarized himself with the ever-changing Regulations. He tried his best to harmonize himself with the Regulations of the two realms.

Right now, he was essentially cultivating with the Regulations of both realms. It was just that he was drawing on lower-level Regulations. However, this was perfect for his current cultivation level.

After a dozen or so days, Ling Han became completely accustomed to this place. He had taken to it like fish to water.

In this Two Realm Battlefield, both the cultivators of the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld would be suppressed to a certain degree. However, Ling Han wasn’t affected at all—he could maintain 100% of his battle prowess.

However, he hadn’t managed to find a single Realm Spirit Stone in his dozen or so days here. This left the old ginseng and Rabbit extremely displeased.

“What a cheap place!” the old ginseng grumbled. He seemed tired, and he retrieved a dudou to wipe the sweat off his forehead. “If I had known this earlier, I might as well have stayed back to watch those women change!”

“We didn’t even find that Netherworld brat!” Rabbit said angrily. There was a cold glint in his completely red eyes.

Meanwhile, Ling Han sat down, planning to grab a bite.

Even in a place like this, he couldn’t shake off his habit as a foodie.

He started a fire and placed some Demonic Beast meat in a large pot. He then added some nutritious Godly medicines. It wasn’t long before a fragrant smell wafted from the pot. Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh in emotion. There were no Demonic Beasts to hunt here, so a bite of meat eaten would mean a bite of meat less. What would he do when he ran out of meat?

“Add an egg in. I’ve heard that eggs are very nutritious.” There was an egg in Rabbit’s paws, and he was just about to toss it into the pot.

“Grandpa Ginseng agrees!” The old ginseng raised his arms in approval, and said, “Before I achieved dao, I was almost killed by an eagle and a rabbit. Now’s the time to exact revenge!”

“Uncle Rabbit will eat you!” Rabbit shot back. This old ginseng actually dared to taunt him?

Peng!

Ling Han threw a fist over. Rabbit actually dared to have thoughts about the egg that he had taken out to sunbathe?

“Aaah!” Rabbit wailed in agony. The old ginseng laughed triumphantly upon seeing this.

After a short while, the nutritious meat soup was ready to be served. The three “people” started to eat voraciously. The old ginseng hadn’t been a foodie before, yet the bad influence of the other two had already rubbed off on him. He was also a foodie now, and his appetite was more so tremendous.

Rabbit kicked the sunbathing egg, and asked, “Brat, what kind of egg is this? It seems fairly extraordinary.” He still hadn’t given up on his desire to eat this egg.

“Bird egg,” Ling Han replied. He moved the egg behind himself lest it was damaged by Rabbit’s kicks. If that were to happen, cooking and eating it would be the only option.

“Good bird or bad bird?” the old ginseng asked on purpose. He knew that Rabbit had an immense hatred for birds. Before achieving dao, Rabbit had often been hunted by all kinds of birds.

Rabbit’s expression instantly became dark.

Ling Han was just about to speak, yet his heart shivered, and he said, “Enemy!”

Rabbit and old ginseng hurriedly prepared to tunnel away. They shamelessly left Ling Han to deal with the enemy by himself.

If there were any problems, it was only natural that the strongest person dealt with it themself. It would be naive to think that the old ginseng and Rabbit would fight with their lives on the line.

‘F*ck!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

Meanwhile, his gaze was fixed on a nearby hill. A slender figure had appeared there, and they were standing with their hands clasped behind their back. Their clothes fluttered in the gentle breeze.

‘Netherworld being!’

This was obvious at a single glance—this person’s aura was completely different from Immortal Realm cultivators’. It was eerie and sinister, and it stood out as obviously as the sun in the sky.

However, what astonished Ling Han was the fact that this person looked just like a human. Only their aura was starkly different.

This person looked around 20-year-old, and they appeared especially strong and handsome.

“It’s him!” Rabbit and old ginseng exclaimed at the same time. They pointed at the man, and shouted, “Little Han, that’s the bastard who chased us!”

‘He’s the Netherworld being who chased Rabbit and the old ginseng, and wanted to make them into a rabbit ginseng soup?’

“Kill him!”

“Grandpa Ginseng is going to break his vegetarian fast and eat a Netherworld human meat bun today!”

Rabbit and old ginseng both shouted enthusiastically. However, both of them retreated even further back. It was clear that they had no plans to charge over and fight to the death.

The Netherworld youth leaped over, landing 30 or so meters in front of Ling Han. A powerful aura radiated from his body. He was clearly at the Sun Moon Tier, yet he gave Ling Han a completely different feeling.

Those in the Immortal Realm possessed the power of construction, while those in the Netherworld possessed the power of destruction. These were two opposing Regulations of heaven and earth.

“Move aside!” the young man commanded. “You don’t have the right to die by my hands!”

‘How bloody arrogant!’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Maybe not, but perhaps you have the right to die by my hands!”

The young man’s eyes twitched.

Boom!

Two balls of flames flashed across his eyes, each releasing a devastating might. It was as if they could melt even Godly metal.

Ling Han’s fighting spirit soared. He was a king tier, a Netherworld king tier.

This was a decent opponent.

“I’m Ao Ziyun, the prince of the Black Dragon Race. Who are you?” the young man said calmly. The shadow of a black True Dragon materialized behind his back. It brandished its teeth and claws, and it exuded an overwhelming pressure.

‘Strange!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

‘There’s a dragon tribe in the Netherworld? And their surname is also Ao? Why do they look just like the dragon tribe in the Immortal Realm?

‘But the two realms are at odds with each other... Could members of these tribes have married each other?’

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “I’m Ling Han!”

“If you can survive three of my attacks, I’ll spare your life,” Ao Ziyun said coldly.
