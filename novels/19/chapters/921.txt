Chapter 922: Zhao Lun’s Gift

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Ling Han, come out!”

Ling Han was in the midst of cultivation when he heard a cold shout ring out. He walked into the courtyard and opened the doors to take a look. There were two young men presently standing outside, and they were both in the Shattering Void Tier, but he recognized neither of them.

They were not from this batch of new students that had enrolled into the Northern Institution, but could be from the last batch, or the batch before that.

“What can I do for you?” Ling Han was calm and collected, though he already had a rough guess.

“That is Senior Brother Wang Wan.”

“And there’s Senior Brother Zhang Qing too!”

“They are both subordinates of Senior Brother Zhao Lun.”

“Pei, how could they be qualified! They are the subordinates of the subordinates of the three great followers of Senior Brother Disciple Zhao Lun; they are gods know how far away from Senior Brother Zhao Lun.”

“Still, the fact that they would appear now means they must definitely be here on behalf of Senior Brother Zhao.”

“Of course, Ling Han actually dared to try and snatch Senior Brother Zhao’s woman! It would be strange if there was no reaction from Senior Brother Zhao.”

One after another, courtyard doors opened, revealing multiple faces. A great many were wearing cold smirks, appearing to be delighting in Ling Han’s miseries.

This was very natural. Not only was Ling Han the first place of this round of new students, he even managed to seduce Senior Sister Shui Yanyu! She was an unprecedented beauty, so who would not be jealous?

Ling Han heard all this, and made an “oh” internally. He knew that Zhao Lun would definitely make a move, but the latter obviously had not taken him seriously, and had only sent two Shattering Void Tier cultivators here.

Was he planning on using violence?

Wang Wan, meanwhile, smirked coldly. This guy that came from a small world was really ignorant; did he think that just because he opened the sky, he had the right to do as he liked in the Immortal Realm? They would teach him the rules today!

“We have come under command of Senior Brother Zhao Lun to deliver a gift to you,” he said.

When those around them heard this, they were all puzzled. Was there something wrong with Zhao Lun? Ling Han had snatched your woman, and you still wanted to give him a gift?

Ling Han was internally calm, and asked, “Oh, what kind of gift?”

Wang Wan and Zhang Qing shared a look. Wang Wan took out a brocade box from his Spatial Spirit Tool. It was wrapped very beautifully, but it was not very big. He held the box in his hands, and said, “Quickly kneel down to receive your gift!”

“Kneel down to receive it?” Ling Han laughed raucously. “Has something gone wrong with your head?”

“It’s a great gift from Senior Brother Zhao, yet you dare not kneel to receive and offer your thanks?” Zhang Qing countered sinisterly.

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively, and said, “If that’s the case, then you can just take this gift back with you. I cannot accept!”

Wang Wan humphed, and said, “It’s a gift that Senior Brother Zhao has given out, how could it be taken back! If you do not want to kneel and receive the gift, fine! Just take it!” He nodded at Zhang Qing.

Zhang Qing got the signal, and began to unwrap the brocade box.

Everyone was curious. What kind of gift did Zhao Lun give Ling Han? None of them thought Zhao Lun was a person easy to deal with. On the contrary, this genius was an arrogant bully, and was well-known for his forcefulness.

The silk cloth outside the brocade box was unwrapped, and Zhang Qing opened the box in front of everyone’s eyes, revealing the contents of the box.

Abruptly, complete silence descended.

The item inside this brocade box was actually a dog’s collar!

The meaning could not be clearer. Zhao Lun was going to treat Ling Han like a dog, taking him to his side and ordering him about.

Such contempt! Such humiliation!

In my eyes, you were a mere dog.

“Ling Han, Senior Brother Zhao said that if you accept this gift, your life will be spared,” Wang Wan said with a smile, his face filled with arrogance.

Shua , everyone’s eyes turned to stare fixedly at Ling Han.

Accepting this gift, he would be Zhao Lun’s servant and lackey, but if he did not accept, his only fate was death.

Who would dare treat Zhao Lun’s words as a mere joke?

Unless Ling Han hid for the rest of his life in the Academy, wouldn’t it be too easy for the son of the Great General Zhao to kill a Shattering Void Tier cultivator?

What was he going to do? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Whether he accepted this gift or otherwise, Ling Han was finished.

There was nothing else that could be done. From the moment that Ling Han and Shui Yanyu were entangled together, his fate was already destined.

A flash of fury flickered in Ling Han’s eyes, yet his expression was frighteningly calm. He looked at that dog collar, and strode out.

Was he planning to accept?

True, compared with his life, what would dignity count as? Furthermore, becoming Zhao Lun’s dog... a great many were more than willing to do so, though Zhao Lun did not consider them worthy in the least.

Wang Wan’s and Zhang Qing’s lips curled up, and their faces were painted all over with ‘as expected’.

Who would not be afraid of death?

Ling Han stretched out a hand and grabbed the collar. Then, in a sudden burst of force, pa , this collar was instantly snapped in two in his hands. He carelessly tossed it onto the ground, and said calmly, “Pass the message to Zhao Lun. I appreciate his kindness, but I do not have the fortune to enjoy.”

Pa , the dog collar was thrown onto the ground, and a crisp sound of impact rang out.

Once again, complete silence fell.

Ling Han was planning to stand against Zhao Lun!

Where had he gotten such courage and confidence from? His opponent was Zhao Lun, the only son of the Great General Zhao Lun, and an elite in the higher levels of the Mountain River Tier! He was also rumored to be a three-star genius. What qualified you to oppose him?

“How dare you, you actually dare to break Senior Brother Zhao’s gift! Do you know what great crime you have committed?” Wang Wan shouted in harsh rebuke.

Ling Han’s eyes were cold as he said, “After being brought something like this to humiliate me, should I not smash it? The two of you get out here immediately, don’t annoy me with the sight of your faces.”

“You are already a dead man, and you still dare to be arrogant?” Wang Wan said icily.

Pa!

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and picked him up in a single move. With his current abilities, those with battle prowess below 20 Stars were naturally no match for him. He squeezed Wang Wan’s neck, and retorted coldly, “Since I am already a dead man, I would not mind dragging a few people to be buried next to me!”

Wang Wan instantly felt all his hair stand on ends. He did not have the slightest bit of resolve to give up his life for Zhao Lun’s sake. He had no enmity with Ling Han, and if he died, then wouldn’t that be a great loss?

“No, no, no, don’t kill me!” he uttered in a trembling voice.

“Coward!” With a careless toss, Ling Han threw Wang Wan out.

The Academy allowed spars, but definitely did not allow killing nor crippling. Ling Han had never thought he was a dead man, so he was naturally not going to throw himself in just because of a nobody.

“Get lost!” he shouted.

Wang Wan and Zhang Qing quickly left with their tails between their legs. They were indeed not weak, but how could there be anyone that was Ling Han’s match in the Shattering Void Tier?

“You’ve forgotten something!” Ling Han raised his foot, and xiu , kicked the broken dog collar over.

Wang Wan caught the collar, but did not dare delay his departure, his dejected figure soon disappearing from sight.

Everyone that witnessed this only felt that though Ling Han managed to be forceful this time, what about afterwards?

While the Academy forbade higher-level students to make a move against lower-level students, Ling Han could not possibly stay in the Shattering Void Tier forever. The moment he advanced into the lower levels of the Mountain River Tier, cultivators at the peak of the lower levels would be able to forcefully challenge him.

It was true that you were a four-star genius, but the Academy similarly did not lack three-star and two-star geniuses, and they could still torture you till you were in so much pain that you wished you were dead.

Moreover, could you stay forever in the Academy?

Everyone shook their heads. Obviously, Ling Han’s days were numbered.

Luo Clan Residence.

Luo Hongdao summoned Luo Ba, and asked, “Have you completed refining the Bloodtear Stone?”

“Yes, Lord Patriarch!” Luo Ba was filled with confidence. His current battle prowess was as high as 21 Stars, which puffed him up with pride.

“That lowlife has become deadly enemies with Zhao Lun, and it is destined that he won’t live long!” Luo Hongdao said. “You’ll immediately go and challenge that lowlife. Otherwise, if he died in Zhao Lun’s hands, there would be no chance for you to wash off your shame. Additionally, if you kill that lowlife for Zhao Lun, we may be able to get a connection with a great tree like the Great General Zhao.”

“Yes, Lord Patriarch!” Luo Ba smirked coldly. He could no longer wait to kill Ling Han.
