Chapter 3560: Sea of True Blood

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The tiny rock golem said with incredible pride. That was a kind of pride that seeped from within its bones and soul.

Yet Ling Han was startled. Ancestral King?

Brother Monkey had also said before that an Ancestral King had appeared among his ancestors, who was invincible in the universe, and ruled over an era. Was Ancestral King Pan Shi also such an existence?

“Lord Pan Shi was originally a stubborn rock in the heaven and earth. After countless years, he developed a sliver of intelligence, and slowly absorbed the power of heaven and earth, stepping onto the path of great dao. In the end, he defeated all enemies of the present generation, and became the strongest,”’ the small stone golem continued, incredibly proud.

No wonder there were rocks everywhere in this place. Since Ancestral King Pan Shi was a rock that had achieved Dao, this made sense.

Even just as a rock, he could become the strongest; just how inspirational was that life story?

Ling Han smiled slightly, “Thus, my bone structure is average, and my natural talent is average. In future, it may not be impossible for me to become an Ancestral King.”

The small rock golem wanted to refute him. What did he think an Ancestral King was? Who knew how many prodigies had fallen at the last step? What gave him the right to be so confident?

However, it had previously used Ancestral King Pan Shi as an example. Since even a rock could attain Dao, why couldn’t Ling Han do the same?

It should be known that the strength of this guy’s foundations had surpassed all prodigies, and was the only one it had ever seen.

However, upon seeing Ling Han’s confident expression, it couldn’t help but say, “Brat, you’re far too arrogant. Do you know what the Ancestral King represents? He’s an emperor of heaven and earth! He can be called Great Emperor, or he can be called the Holy Emperor! It’s synonym for invincibility!” Ling Han nodded, an indifferent expression on his face. In the Genesis World, hadn’t he climbed from an ordinary person to the position of strongest? For him, this was a walk in the park. He would just have to walk the path once more.

The small rock golem was practically driven mad. Where did this young man get such confidence from? Furthermore, he could not be strike a blow to his confidence at all.

Forget it, it would not lower itself to his level.

“I’m only saying this to let you know just how powerful Lord Pan Shi is!” it said.

Ling Han nodded, and swept an eye over the twelve stone statues, “Lord Pan Shi’s true self is among them?”

Hahahaha!” The small stone golem laughed loudly, “Brat, you are really too naive. If Lord Pan Shi’s true self was here, would you still be standing unscathed? You would have long since been shattered by the powerful aura.” “To say nothing of you, even Saints would have to prostrate on the ground if they came.”

Though Ling Han’s heart and spirit swayed slightly, he was still calm and natural. He was sure that he would definitely be able to climb to the peak of martial arts.

“Then where is Lord Pan Shi?” he asked.

“Sigh, even the invincible Ancestral Kings aren’t immortal. Lord Pan Shi naturally died long ago,” the small stone golem said. “However, milord laid out this Ethereal Peak in the late stages of his life. It can traverse endlessly through the universe, giving some people help so that they can better step onto the Celestial Path.”

“However, for true prodigies, the Lord has other plans.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was slightly excited. Since the rock golem had said so much, he was obviously going to receive special treatment.

“Hehe, do you know what these so-called Foundation Building Divine Stones are?” The small stone figure was proud of itself, as if it was showing off.

“I don’t know.” Ling Han shook his head, but deliberately revealed an expectant look, greatly satisfying this rock golem’s vanity.

Sure enough, the small rock golem even more pleased with itself, and said “My Lord left behind a drop of true blood, which turned into an ocean, and these so-called stones are ordinary stones that have been tossed into the the Sea of True Blood. It is only because of the influence of My Lord’s true blood that they possess endless Mystical Powers.”

Only now did Ling Han reveal an expression of shock. The Foundation Building Divine Stone that everyone thought of as a precious treasure was actually formed from a stone?

Just how powerful was an Ancestral King?

A drop of True Blood turned into a sea, nourishing who knew how many rocks. They all turned into Divine Stones, and were bestowed on others generation after generation, never exhausted.

“Now do you know how powerful Lord Pan Shi is?” The small stone figure said proudly, “Those that can become Ancestral Kings are all the strongest elites of their generation, but throughout history, Lord Pan Shi’s battle prowess can also be ranked in the top ten, no, top three of all Ancestral Kings!”

“The more ordinary an existence is, the harder it is to attain Dao, but if one really manages to climb to the peak, he would be absolutely strong, and would be invincible among invincibility.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel a sense of yearning. An ordinary rock that had been exposed to the elements, it had been trampled on, and it had also been laid on by wild beasts. It had silently endured for countless years, yet it had finally developed intelligence. It absorbed the power of heaven and earth to slowly cultivate, and began its path of cultivation.

Just how difficult was this?

But it was this kind of existence that ultimately became the number one in the world, invincible for an era.

Ling Han couldn’t help but imagine in his mind just how magnificent Lord Pan

Shi had been all those years ago.

“Is this how Lord Pan Shi looked like all those years ago?” he asked.

The small stone statue nodded, and said nostalgically, “However, no matter how excellent a carver is, he can’t carve a sliver of My Lord’s charm. That stone statue that your divine sense can’t see has been touched by My Lord before. It’s just that, and it’s already developed a spirit through the ages.”

This was indeed boundlessly strong.

“Foundation Building with Divine Stones, and even the cornerstone of the Celestial Path originated from My Lord. Then, no matter how amazingly talented you are, there is no way that you can leap out of the shackles of My Lord. The highest accomplishment would only be limited to Saint-level, and it would be impossible to take another step further.” The small stone figure changed the topic, and finally brought the conversation back to the main topic. “Thus, as for ordinary people, I will be responsible for gifting them a Divine Stone, which would be of great help to them, but for true prodigies, I will bring him to the Sea of True Blood, and let him experience the Intent Realm of the Lord.”

“Only when you walk your own path, would you be able to reach the strongest.” Ling Han nodded. Actually, he was also very repulsed by fusing foreign matter into his body. Previously, in Genesis World, he had also relied on himself to become a Heavenly Venerable Tier elite, and because he had walked a completely different path, he had become the strongest Heavenly Venerable Tier elite.

“Come on.” The small rock grabbed Ling Han, and xiu, the two of them disappeared from the mountaintop.

Ling Han’s vision blurred, and he saw that he was already in an ocean. This ocean was as crimson as blood, yet there were multiple streaks of multicolored light rising from it, which was incredibly magnificent.

It was just a drop of blood, and it had turned into a sea, and it actually still had such a grand appearance?

Just how powerful was an Ancestral King?

“The Lord has refined the domineering nature of the True Blood. Otherwise, a single drop of blood would be enough to shock a Saint to death,” the small stone figure said proudly. Then, it loosened its grip, and Ling Han dropped downwards, “You have three days to undergo appreciation. When the time is up, I will come and take you out.”

Plop, Ling Han fell into the sea. This water did not have the slightest bit of buoyancy, and he immediately sank straight down.

Above his head, the light quickly disappeared, but Ling Han didn’t feel stifled at all. It was as if every pore on his body was breathing.

He was just sinking like that. This great ocean seemed to have no bottom.

If there was no bottom, so be it. Ling Han calmed his mind, and went to experience the Dao of Ancestral King Pan Shi.

In a daze, he saw a stubborn rock that had been battered by the elements. There were large eagles that flew past, and perched on it to peck at the fish that were hunted. There were also wild beasts that lay on it, leaving behind signs of life..
