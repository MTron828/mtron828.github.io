2766 Tea-serving maid

“What great insolence!” Everyone whispered among themselves. Most of the cultivators of the Foreign Realm tended to be fiercer than the people of the Celestial Realm. They all set their eyes on Ling Han and company, looking menacing.

‘Lord Huai Jian has broken through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and this is a matter that should be celebrated by all, yet you people actually dare to come and cause trouble?’

“Heh, don’t think that you are invincible just because you are an Eighteenth Lotus.” Some people stepped out, sneering.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was not just one. In the blink of an eye, seven Eighteenth Lotus elites had appeared, surrounding Ling Han and the others.

The pride and authority of a Heavenly Venerate could not permit offense.

“Surrender, and don’t resist arrest,” an Eighteenth Lotus elite demanded. With his insight, he naturally could tell with a glance that only Bewitching Maiden Rou had attained the Eighteenth Lotus out of this whole group. The others were only in the Tenth Lotus. In fact, there were two of them that had not even reached the Tenth Lotus.

That naturally was Ling Han and the Empress. That was because one of them was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, while the other was a First Tier Heavenly Venerate. They had both left the range of Celestial King Tier, and returned to the basics1.

Bewitching Maiden Rou crossed her arms. “Come battle me, then!”

She took the initiative to charge out. Shua! A whip appeared in her grip, and she lashed out at the seven great Eighteenth Lotus elites.

This whip was a Celestial Tool which Ling Han had made for her.

…After so many years had passed, the amount of Divine Metal in Ling Han’s possession was also astonishing. There was enough to allow the women to not only have one each, but in fact, what they were wearing could also be made from Divine Metal, having high stats in both attack and defense.

Thus, the Bewitching Maiden Rou charged out without any fear.

To say the least, even if she did not have this whole set, wasn’t there still Ling Han and the Empress backing her up?

“Ancestral weapon!” These Eighteenth Lotus elites all humphed, and they summoned their own Celestial Tools as well.

Having reached a level equivalent to the Ninth Heaven, how could they possibly have been unable to gain a Celestial Tool?

Ding, ding! Dang, dang! The eight of them fought intensely.

Being able to advance to the Ninth Heaven, especially in a low-level dimension, all of them were definitely supreme prodigies, so not only did the Bewitching Maiden Rou not get the upper hand, she was being suppressed instead.

However, these Eighteenth Lotus elites very soon discovered, much to their dismay, that their opponent actually had another Celestial Tool as armor on her, and there were extremely high-level seals flickering on it at that. It possessed astonishingly strong defense.

These were seals that Ling Han had inscribed. They possessed a portion of the might of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and combined with the power of Divine Metal, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not penetrate this defense.

The disadvantage was that these seals weren’t permanent. Once in a while, they would have to be drawn anew.

If this was another Heavenly Venerate, who would do such a thing? Wasn’t it too troublesome?

But Ling Han was unconcerned. If not spending time on his wife, then what would he be spending time on?

Bewitching Maiden Rou did not have to worry about defense at all. She only had to continuously attack.

This gave her too much of an advantage. She only had to attack and forget defense entirely, which was extremely impressive.

However, though the seven great Eighteenth Lotus elites could not capture the Bewitching Maiden Rou, it was no issue for them to ensure their own safety. After all, their battle prowess was not inferior to the Bewitching Maiden Rou’s, what more when the seven of them were all working together.

As Bewitching Maiden Rou gave a soft shout, lightning flickered on her body. Zi! Very quickly, nine-colored divine light condensed on the body of the whip.

Five Elements Lightning Technique!

This was a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and she could only use it a few times. This was still due to the fact that she had the protection of the precious suit of armor she was wearing, so she could sustain attacks head-on. Otherwise, she would not dare to gather power for a powerful move while she was being ganged up on by seven great elites, either.

But once the powerful move was used, her battle prowess also soared high with a crackle.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Wherever the whip swept past, its power could not be matched.

So what if there were seven great elites? In an instant, they were all in shambles, none of them daring to face the whip’s power head-on.

This was a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and with how difficult it was to pass on, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could not possibly learn it… if he did not have a Heavenly Venerate for a Master or father.

The spectators were all dumbfounded. The seven supreme elites were actually unable to subdue this woman?

Heavens, could it be that she was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

“Step back!” A feminine voice filled with authority rang out, allowing no refusal. The seven great elites all held their breaths, and stepped aside.

A woman walked out from the mountains. She was treading on air as she came towards them. There was no iridescent light wrapped around her, but she exuded an air that would cause one to tremble. She was of the Angel Race, with two massive white wings sprouting from her back. She had a golden halo above her head, and was astonishingly beautiful.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed slightly. This was an “old friend,” Jing Zhongyue!

When he had used the power of the Black Tower to begin a massacre at the Divine Desolate Mountain, only Huai Jian and Jing Zhongyue possessed precious tools protecting them because they were favored by the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, and thus managed to escape.

After so many years, Huai Jian had become a Heavenly Venerate, and this woman… had actually become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate as well.

“Greetings, milady!” The seven great elites all knelt, paying their respects to Jing Zhongyue. There were some among them who were even a good number of times older than Jing Zhongyue, but age was never a factor on the path of cultivation. The only things that mattered were cultivation level and strength.

Jing Zhongyue nodded. With her feet bare and snow-white skin, she exuded an air of purity. Even if the Demon Race hated the Angel Race, they had to admit that she was a beauty that would enchant even them.

Jing Zhongyue glanced at Bewitching Maiden Rou, and coldly demanded, “Who are you?”

Bewitching Maiden Rou chuckled, and said, “Little girl, you are quite pretty. How about becoming a tea-serving maid for my husband?”

Upon hearing this, a wave of commotion spread through the crowd.

Insolent, this was too insolent. To actually dare ask a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to become a maid? Whether it was to serve tea or warm the bed, it was still a great insult.

In the entire world, the Heavenly Venerable Tier was the strongest. Who could insult a Heavenly Venerate?

Everyone was outraged, wanting nothing more than to tear Ling Han to pieces.

When Ling Han saw how everyone’s eyes were focused on him, he couldn’t help but exclaim about his innocence mentally. It was not he who said this, so why were they targeting him?

Jing Zhongyue was also cold. “Initially, I only wanted to pass a light punishment on you, seeing as it was not easy for you to attain the Eighteenth Lotus, but you insist on courting your own death!” She moved, and grabbed out at the Bewitching Maiden Rou.

It was naturally impossible that Bewitching Maiden Rou would be a worthy match for a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Thus, she hurriedly called out, “Sister Luan Xing, help!”

Peng!

The Empress moved, and Jing Zhongyue was very casually sent flying with a wave of the former’s jade-like palm, breaking through countless mountain rocks on her course, and finally sinking into the body of the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords.

The Empress’ hand was much heavier than the Bewitching Maiden Rou’s, and Jing Zhongyue, as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, could withstand the impact too, so she directly created a hole with the collision that she had with the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords.

‘This…!’

Everyone was rendered speechless. This was actually a Heavenly Venerate.

It was said that a Heavenly Venerate could not be insulted. Then since dirty water could not be poured on Huai Jian, how could this one condone the same thing?

‘You people wish to capture those close to her and punish them at the slightest provocation. What position did that place the pride and authority of this Heavenly Venerate?’

“Heh, when has such a powerful friend appeared in our dimension?” Amidst laughter, a considerable number of figures shot downwards from the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords.

When everyone saw this, they hurriedly bowed in greeting.

“Greetings, Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity!”

“Greetings, Heavenly Venerate Chi Yan!”

“Greetings, Heavenly Venerate Yellow Spring!”

“Greetings, Heavenly Venerate Huai Jian!”

Four Heavenly Venerates had appeared together. This party was too powerful. Any single one of them possessed strength capable of conquering the whole world.

The four great Heavenly Venerates all stood with their arms crossed behind their backs, while their eyes were set upon the Empress.

The Empress could not be bothered to maintain the disguise, and immediately revealed her true appearance.

“What? This is actually a human girl!”

“Hasn’t the Celestial Realm long since called a ceasefire with us? Why has a Heavenly Venerate suddenly come here?”

“This is probably a newly promoted one. It is said that there are already no Heavenly Venerates standing guard over at the Celestial Realm.”

Everyone exclaimed in shock, feeling extremely flabbergasted.

“Who exactly are you?” Huai Jian demanded. After his advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, his aura had become increasingly steady and stable.
