Chapter 2393: Arrival of Elites

Ling Han’s words were courageous and moving, yet he was now using the pitiful Wally as a shield. This was… utterly shameless!

Meanwhile, Wally was filled with confusion. “Why are you grabbing me?”

“I’m scared that you’ll trip,” Ling Han randomly replied.

Wally became even more confused, and he said, “I have a strong balancing ability, so I won’t trip even if I lose my center of gravity. There’s no need for you to grab me.”

“Don’t worry, just treat this as me respecting elders and caring for youth,” Ling Han said, continuing to make up nonsense.

Others could see through his nonsense in an instant. However, Wally could only react after performing the necessary calculations. Right now, he had determined that the seventh building posed almost no danger to them at all. Thus, he was naturally confused about Ling Han’s intentions.

In terms of analysis alone, Wally was definitely one of a kind. Perhaps even Heavenly Venerates couldn’t rival him. In terms of simple emotional intelligence, however, he was on the same level as toddlers.

Wally wore an expression of confusion. However, he still nodded and accepted the excuse of “respecting elders and caring for youth.” This was because he was indeed very old.

Ling Han entered the building with Wally. Qing Qing also wanted to enter, yet she was dragged back by Bewitching Maiden Rou, who shook her head, and said, “It’s dangerous!”

Qing Qing also wore an expression of confusion as she looked up at Bewitching Maiden Rou. Her expression could certainly compete with Wally’s.

Ling Han advanced very slowly, with his Divine Demon Sword in his right hand and his shield, Wally, in his left hand. He was extremely careful as he took each step. He didn’t know what dangers lay ahead, so he naturally had to be as careful as he could.

Like the maw of a gigantic beast, the inside of the building was pitch-black.

However, when Ling Han arrived in the depths of the building, the surroundings suddenly became bright and illuminated. The pitch-black building instantly became radiant.

He squinted his eyes as he observed the surroundings. This building was completely different from what he had imagined. There were no shelves here, and there was instead a gigantic mirror in the middle of the room.

Was this some kind of paramount treasure? One that needed the protection of a self-destructive restriction?

Its owner had forged it, yet restricted it to this building. It was as if they were hesitant to destroy it, yet also hesitant to have others obtain it. This made Ling Han extremely curious about this mirror.

He casually tossed Wally aside as he looked toward the mirror, only to see his own reflection appearing in the mirror. Looking closely, his figure disappeared, and what replaced it was an expanse of starry sky.

Looking again, and the starry sky also disappeared. What replaced it was something that even Ling Han couldn’t comprehend.

“This is… dimension coordinates!” Wally suddenly exclaimed. His voice was filled with emotion.

“What’s dimension coordinates?” Ling Han asked.

Wally pondered for a moment before replying, “For example, if we want to enter another dimension, we can only travel through the connection between the two dimensions. However, each dimension will definitely have its own weak points. If these weak points are discovered by elites, they can use their profound power to directly enter through these points.”

“So we can use this item to enter other dimensions?” Ling Han asked.

Wally shook his head, and said, “The person who created this machine possesses astonishing knowledge of the Regulations of Space. He found the weak point of your dimension—of course, this might also be an incorrect discovery. In any case, only elites from other dimensions can arrive through here.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Only others could arrive through here, and they couldn’t use it to leave. This was truly a useless item.

No wonder the owner of this place had put a strict restriction on the mirror. If it were activated, they would be inviting enemies into their house.

“This item is a threat.” Ling Han pondered for a moment before continuing, “We have to destroy it!”

The original owner most likely hadn’t been willing to destroy it. After all, it was the culmination of their hard work. Moreover, this mirror was indeed an advanced tool. However, the original owner had clearly realized its threat as well. Thus, they had put a strict restriction on it in order to avoid any dangers.

Wally didn’t say anything. However, green light beamed from his eyes, and continually scanned the mirror.

Ling Han brandished his Divine Demon Sword, leaping forward and slashing down at the mirror.

Right at this moment, however, something peculiar happened.

The mirror suddenly lit up before starting to spin, becoming quicker and quicker.

“Wally!” Ling Han shouted. This person didn’t activate the mirror, did he?

Wally didn’t reply, and he continued to scan the mirror.

With a roar, Ling Han raised his Divine Demon Sword again.

Swoosh!

A burst of sword light swept forward, launching toward the mirror like a gigantic dragon.

Weng!

A terrifying aura emanated into the surroundings, and it was as if the heavens were about to collapse.

The Sword Qi shattered with a crack before it could even strike the mirror, dissipating like a firework.

Gasp!

Ling Han involuntarily drew a sharp breath. This mirror was a precious tool—or as Wally called it, a machine. It could mark the location of the Celestial Realm for countless other realms. It was like a lighthouse.

Through the guidance of this lighthouse, paramount beings from other dimensions could traverse across dimensions to arrive here.

This was a weak spot that could be penetrated.

Just then, Ling Han hadn’t been worried. Firstly, the mirror hadn’t been activated. Secondly, even if it were activated, there was most likely not an elite who was so bored that they would continue to observe the Genesis World. As such, they wouldn’t realize that a lighthouse had suddenly appeared.

In any case, it was unconfirmed whether this was a true weak point.

At this moment, Ling Han truly wanted to curse.

It appeared as if all three conditions had been satisfied…

This kind of petrifying aura… definitely belonged to the Heavenly Venerates such as Heavenly Venerate Wu Le.

Who was this? Who was coming over?

If this were a Heavenly Venerate from a foreign dimension, just what kind of destructive damage would they cause? With a bellow, he started to swing his Divine Demon Sword.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

Bursts of Sword Qi dashed forward, dancing in the air like dragons.

However, the aura emanating from the mirror was still increasing in power. The Sword Qi from the Divine Demon Sword was completely unable to inhibit it.

Ling Han wanted to directly hack the mirror with his sword, yet he didn’t even possess the ability to approach it.

This aura was so profound that even the heavens would have to prostrate.

Boom!

Dark clouds formed overhead, signaling the formation of heavenly tribulation.

This was a reaction from the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm. A paramount being was trying to enter this realm, so even heaven and earth were treating them as an enemy.

The existence of Heavenly Venerates was transcendent above the Regulations, so they were innately ruining the equilibrium already.

The women and the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire also entered the building. They were stunned by what they saw. Moreover, the paramount aura that suffused the surroundings made them go weak at the knees, forcing them to collapse to the floor.

Only one person was unaffected—Qing Qing!

This was far too astonishing. This was the furious aura of a Heavenly Venerate, yet a young girl was actually able to face it with no fear?!

If one wanted to withstand the aura of a Heavenly Venerate, they had to be at least at the Eighth Heaven or Ninth Heaven of the Celestial King Tier. Could this young girl possibly be such an elite?

Qing Qing’s expression remained one of confusion. However, when she looked at the mirror, her eyes gradually became clear. A paramount aura started to seep from her body.

Right at this moment, the mirror suddenly shuddered, with its surface undulating like waves.

A figure appeared, and it was as if they had walked over from a profound depth. The mirror shuddered violently, and a head pushed at its surface, forcing it to stretch 30 centimeters out. It was as if they were about to break out from the mirror. However, the mirror possessed powerful elasticity, rendering the person’s attempts futile.

However, the person started to push with their hands as well, and with a slight burst of power…

Pa!

The surface of the mirror shattered all across the floor. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A figure appeared where the mirror had been.

Gasp!

A person had genuinely traversed through the dimensions and arrived at the Celestial Realm?

Ling Han and the others gazed over. This was a handsome person who looked to be around 20-years-old. However, this wasn’t important. His aura was far too profound, causing the thunderclouds above them to become increasingly dense. It was as if they were about to unleash the energy of the entire heaven and earth.
