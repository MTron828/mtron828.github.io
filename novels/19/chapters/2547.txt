Chapter 2548: Well-prepared

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Terrifying explosions rang out everywhere around the group. They couldn’t even run out of here, because the fruits were blasting towards them from all directions. There wasn’t any so-called safe course at all.

They were all sent flying like blades of straw. It was like their bodies no longer belonged to them as they could not command their bodies to move according to their will at all.

A whole dozen or so breath laters, these intense explosions finally came to a halt.

The previously lush and verdant ground had now become a true land of death. All the plants had been destroyed, leaving only behind charred ground, and they were lying here and there on the ground. There was no one that could avoid being injured and bleeding.

The three great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were still fine as they only had a few scrapes, but the others were much more tragic. They even had many broken bones.

Ling Han released the arm that was holding the Empress. In the great explosion just now, he had pulled the Empress closely to him for protection, with him shielding her mostly, while he himself channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Though his injuries weren’t very severe, it was inevitable that he was still covered with blood.

Wally had directly fallen apart, but he was the person that needed the least concern. His body immediately rebuilt itself, as if nothing had happened.

With a notch taken down on them, everyone was shocked.

How were they supposed to advance?

Everyone ignored this issue first as they took out alchemical pills to ingest. Some of them were very seriously injured.

The alchemical pills they ingested were very extraordinary, and their injuries were rapidly recovering, but soon an expression of shock appeared on all of their faces.

That was because the originally charred ground was turning green as tree saplings and blades of grass sprouted out of the ground, growing very quickly.

In just half a day, the tree saplings had already grown several meters tall, the grass was already tall enough to reach one’s waist, and flowers bloomed at the same time.

‘This…!’

After flowers bloomed, fruits would naturally be borne. Fruits of all colors reappeared, and the scene here returned to its initial appearance.

Everyone hurriedly retreated out of here. Forging onwards like this was merely suicidal. There were even more plants ahead of them.

Several days later, everyone finally recovered, and the plants in this area had also recovered completely, which meant that they were back to square one.

“Looks like we can only depend on one person.” Everyone looked towards Wally.

“You… What do you want?” Even if Wally did not understand human behavior, he instinctively sensed that everyone was bearing malice towards him.

“Go on.” The Imperial Void Celestial King grabbed Wally, and threw him ahead of them.

Boom!

Explosions rang out again. This was really too terrifying. Even if they were all standing outside, they could feel the waves of explosions causing shock waves that assailed them. There were shards of seals contained within them, which greatly increased the destructive power.

Fortunately, this was not the center of the explosion, after all, so they were not too greatly affected.

After the explosions stopped, a very large area had once again turned into a land of death, completely charred and scorched, and Wally was rapidly recovering, his body reforming, and taking human form again.

Wally was naturally furious, lasers of light about to shoot from his eyes.

“One piece of Divine Metal,” Ling Han said.

Wally immediately stopped, considered carefully, and then made a counteroffer. “Three!”

“Two, and no more than that,” Ling Han said firmly.

“Alright.”

Wally took the initiative to advance.?Boom, he once again caused a great explosion.

Wally’s freakish nature could be seen at this moment. No matter how terrifying the destructive power was, it still could not cause him any fatal injuries. He would immediately recover after the blasting had stopped.

With every safe area that Wally created by causing an explosion, everyone would advance further, so how fast could they progress? This was determined by the speed of Wally’s recovery.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel rueful. This recovery ability was too frightening. It was no wonder that Heavenborn was so highly valued in the martial academy. Without any Heavenly Venerate attacking him, he was completely immortal and indestructible.

A day later, they finally arrived at the end of this area. A stone tablet was wrapped around in vines that bore purple fruits.

This time, there was no need for Wally to approach. Everyone attacked it from afar, detonating these fruits.

It was not known what kind of material the stone tablet was made from, but it was incredibly sturdy. It had not been destroyed by the explosion, and was completely unscathed.

Everyone came forwards to contribute some blood. The plants in this whole area seemed to have gotten some kind of signal as they all sank into the ground, and this area became completely barren.

“I’ll stay behind,” a supreme monarch star said. His name was Ji Zhihang. He did not like talking, and had kept silent on the whole journey here. Unexpectedly, he now spoke up to volunteer to stay behind.

Upon further thought, this was normal. That was because opening or closing the formation eye of each area would be very exhausting. Furthermore, there weren’t any benefits to gain, either. Who would be willing to do this kind of thing?

It was better to stay here, where it was safe, and spare oneself the effort. Furthermore, when the great formation finally stopped working, the restrictions would no longer exist, and it would be incredibly convenient to go anywhere in this central area.

Ling Han couldn’t help but glance at He Runhai. Though this man was wearing a calm smile, Ling Han kept feeling that there was a sliver of menace in his eyes.

“We will definitely not stay behind. No matter what, we have to keep an eye on him and Liu Yufei,” he said.

The large black dog nodded. He naturally was also very clever. Though forging onwards with He Runhai was both tiring and difficult, he could hold the initiative.

The Empress naturally would not object. The only one she was concerned about was Ling Han.

They left this area, and arrived at the fifth area.

This was a land of fire. Fiery flames shot skywards here. They hadn’t even entered yet, but they could already feel a terrifyingly high temperature assail them, making them feel like there was an intense burning feeling on their skin.

“This seems to be Core Flames, they can even melt Divine Metal!” Gu Heyi said.

“Then how do we pass?”

In terms of defense, there was nothing that was harder, and could withstand heat better than Divine Metal. If these flames could even melt Divine Metal, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be troubled.

They could last a period of time, but there would eventually come a time when their Source Power was completely exhausted. By then, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be completely burnt to ashes.

It was just like how Ling Han’s physique had been invincible among his peers, yet they could still use Regulations to slowly corrode him.

Everyone looked towards He Runhai. Did he have any solution to this?

He Runhai chuckled, and took out a jade bottle. “I have already said that I can be of help. This is the Icy Springwater that I have harvested from the depths of hell, and it can temporarily extinguish these flames.”

This guy was indeed well prepared. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Yufei lowered her gaze, her eyes filled with shock. She had originally thought that she had already grasped all the information about this ancient site, yet looking at how well-prepared He Runhai was now, she knew that what she had found out had only been scraps.

She knew He Runhai very well. The latter was definitely an anti-hero who could resort to unscrupulous means just to achieve his aim. Anyone could be sacrificed.

“Come then!”

He Runhai took the lead. He waved the jade bottle, and a wide spread of eerie liquid poured out. Wherever the water poured, the flames would immediately explode and go out.

“Underworld Springwater of Nine Hells,” the large black dog muttered, feeling very envious. “This is valuable, capable of even freezing a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.”

Ling Han was surprised. “This guy has really gone to great expense, taking out even something so valuable?”

“You have to lose some to gain some. What he is aiming for must be even more valuable.” The large black dog nodded.

“But we also have two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings on our side, and not only are we not weaker than him, we are even stronger. Isn’t he afraid that he would simply be paving the way for others?”

“That means that he must have some way of restraining us which could safeguard his own benefits.”

Ling Han and the large black dog exchanged looks, and they were both absolutely certain.

“We need to pay even more attention to him.”
