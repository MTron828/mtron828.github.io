1277 Identity Really Revealed

Liu Shi was guarded by the precious tower, and Ling Han wouldn’t be able to slice through it in the short term, so there was naturally no need for him to waste time.

“Do you have some strange, bizarre God Tools?” Ling Han sized up the other person from the Heaven’s Sword Palace curiously.

The man was already scared out of his wits.

He had initially thought that with Liu Shi, they would be able to easily take Ling Han down, but the result was far, far out of his expectations. Liu Shi was actually forced so far by Ling Han that he could only protect himself, and he had now become Ling Han’s target instead.

In this moment, his cold sweat dripped like rain. He felt that his legs were weak, and as if he couldn’t even stand steady anymore.

The combining of user and Tool was a secret technique that belonged exclusively to the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. Only after they had broken through to this cultivation level would they be taught the technique by the sect. Thus, he could not produce any powerful God Tool. Even if he could, his cultivation level was still too low. What qualified him to stand against Ling Han?

“You dare!!” Liu Shi’s voice rang out from within the previous tower. Two divine swords shot out of his hands, slicing out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han brandished his own sword to parry, and shot out multiple flashes of Sword Qi, completely dispersing Liu Shi’s attack. However, the other person from the Heaven’s Sword Palace also took advantage of the opening to flee. He was really scared out of his wits, his legs flying madly. He only hated the fact that he did not have a few more legs, and could not flee fast enough.

“Can you flee?” Ling Han shook his head. He used the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow. Xiu, an arrow swept out quickly like a flash of light, and soon caught up to that person. Pu, the arrow had pierced through the man’s chest, forcibly tearing that person into two.

However, the vitality of Sun Moon Tier cultivators was really too strong. They would not die even if their bodies had been separated in half. The hands crawled, the legs jumped, and the two halves of the body would join back into one. Connected with Origin Power, and nurtured for a few years, who knew, maybe they would be a new man again.

“So troublesome!” Ling Han drew the bow once more.

“Don’t even think about it!” Liu Shi roared. He stimulated the precious tower to cast a shadow over Ling Han.

Ling Han changed the direction of the arrow, and shot out at Liu Shi. Xiu, the arrow of Origin Power was so fast that even elites of the Sun Moon Tier would find it difficult to grasp its course.

Pu!

This arrow shot into Liu Shi’s left shoulder. If it were not for the fact that he managed to dodge a bit in the nick of time, this arrow definitely would have penetrated his heart. Then, even if he had not died, he would’ve been severely wounded.

Liu Shi paled in shock. How could this arrow be so fast? Moreover, it was so powerful that even his defensive Origin Power could not block the attack. Though he still had a great many ultimate techniques he had yet to use, he had now lost all of his fighting spirit.

This young man made him feel a pressure as if there was no way for him to oppose him.

He had a feeling of foreboding in his heart, and that was even if the strongest elites of the sect moved, they might not be able to take this young man down. However, even if one could not, then what about two? Or three?

Even if they were Immortals, their power was limited. Once that limit had been exceeded, then they would still die, no matter how strong they were.

He had already decided. He would immediately make a report about Ling Han having arrived to the Cloud Apex Planet, and send out the Heaven’s Sword Palace’s... no, send out all the elites of the Five Sects to besiege Ling Han and kill him.

Otherwise, with the freakish pace of improvement that this brat had, it probably wouldn’t take as much as a few years, and he would be on equal levels with the Five Sects. By then, it would be eternally impossible for them to suppress the latter.

He was also a decisive person. Immediately, he gritted his teeth, turned around, and left. The precious tower spun lightly, sending down multiple streaks of flames, and forming a powerful shield for him.

“Ancestor Liu! Ancestor Liu!” the remaining person from the Heaven’s Sword Palace called out desperately. He had forcefully joined his body back together, but he should be given at least 15 minutes’ time to recover. Only then would he be able to forcibly use his Origin Power to piece his body back together again and recover his ability to move.

But now that Liu Shi had abandoned him, this meant that he would be absolutely alone without any help.

“Haha, and you guys wanted to eat Grandpa Ginseng, just eat my precious ginseng foot!” The old ginseng was beginning to act up again. The powerful enemy had fled, and the only one left behind was close to dying. Naturally, he was now fearless, and rushed up to deliver a series of kicks.

That person was in the high extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. In his prime condition, he could suppress the old ginseng single-handedly, but now, he could only be kicked madly by the old ginseng. Only a few kicks later, he was already pouring out blood like mad as he had been directly kicked to death by the old ginseng.

“F***, Grandpa Ginseng is too awesome. Just broke through to the Sun Moon Tier, and I have already killed a powerful enemy in the consummate level!” The old ginseng was very confident in himself. “I have to celebrate this with 100-year-old undergarment.”

Indeed, he drew out a pink undergarment, and breathed in heavily, his expression intoxicated.

“Pervert!” Ling Han and Rabbit shot out a foot at the same time, sending the old ginseng flying.

However, Liu Shi had fled.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then gave up the idea of chasing after him. That precious tower God Tool of his had very strong defenses, and even if he used the Divine Demon Sword, he would need a very long period of time to penetrate through it. However, Liu Shi was not about to stay there and wait for him to break through the defenses.

This place was not too far off from Wolf Fang City, after all.

‘This is good too. I’ll pull the snake from its hole, and have them come besiege me. I’ll take advantage of the chance to kill a few more,’ Ling Han thought. It still had yet to be determined who was the hunter and who was the prey.

‘At present, my abilities would advancing by leaps and bounds every three months. In another half a year, I will truly be confident that I will be able to kill even those at the peak stage of the consummate level with my sword.’

If he now stood against the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, he could only depend on the Misty Soul Capturing Flower to restrain them. But as his cultivation level became higher and higher, then he could kill his enemies with his own power.

This also corresponded with Ling Han’s Dao, and that was pursuing his own personal strength.

‘I’ll switch to another place. Who knows, I may be able to pick up a few Realm Spirit Stones. I have come by opening the sky, so I have been boosted with the good fortune from the heaven and earth. My luck is much better than any other person’s.’

To Ling Han, the Origin Power that he had accumulated from cultivation could not possibly compare to taking the Berserk Blood Spirit Pills. Thus, this was purely a waste of time. He would simply concoct some alchemical pills, then roam around in this spacious Two Realm Battlefield, kill a few beings of the Netherworld to earn merit points, and see if he could pick up a few Realm Spirit Stones while he was at it.

HIs luck was really quite good. He actually managed to pick up a few Realm Spirit Stones, but there were only the size of his little finger. Their value could not even compare to 1% of the value of that large Realm Spirit Stone.

“There will be a time when I finish my luck!” he murmured ruefully.

On the other side, after Liu Shi went back to Wolf Fang City, he gathered the people from the Heaven’s Sword Palace to prevent them from encountering Ling Han and then being eliminated one by one. He communicated with the Heaven’s Sword Palace at the same time to report the matter of Ling Han.

He stressed many times that they could not underestimate Ling Han just because he had come from a small world and had only cultivated for a few decades.

This enemy... they had to use their full efforts to deal with him. Otherwise, if he was allowed to mature and grow, he would become a calamity to the Heaven’s Sword Palace.

After receiving this report, a fierce debate first rose up in the Heaven’s Sword Sect. One portion expressed their agreement with Liu Shi’s opinion, and wanted to join up with the other Five Sects to hunt Ling Han down together. There was another portion though that thought Liu Shi had exaggerated the matter.

Not even 10 years had passed since Ling Han opened the sky until now, and he already possessed enough power to become a threat to the Five Sects?

What a joke. 10 years’ time was not even enough time for an Immortal level cultivator to have the slightest improvement in his cultivation level, and what about Ling Han? Not counting the time he had taken to advance from the Shattering Void Tier to Immortal level, he had already raced all the way up to the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier?

Finally, it still alerted a person of authority who had been in seclusion for a very long time. He decisively suppressed the argument of both sides, and commanded the Heaven’s Sword Palace to immediately summon the other four sects. They would send out all their elites to besiege Ling Han and kill him.

Without considering anything else, merely for Ling Han’s “sin” of opening the sky, he was intent on killing this man.
