Chapter 1677: Fighting Ding Xiaochen

That was a woman that was completely enshrouded in a black long dress, her features old-fashioned. Though she looked to only be in her twenties, she was serious in speech and manner, as if someone owed her a large sum of money, and disliked anyone she cast her eye on.

She was ruthless in her moves, controlling the rarely seen Regulations of Darkness. As darkness swept past, everything would be corroded, which was incredibly frightening.

Ling Han had also cultivated Regulations of Darkness, and that was the Darkness of the Paramount Night, but it was more inclined towards a supplementary skill, completely different from her corrosive power that was filled with destruction.

“And there is that youth too.” Ling Han signaled.

The youth he was speaking of looked to be only in his mid-teens, still bearing a childish look on his face. Occasionally, he would show a sheepish grin, but if anyone were to think that he was harmless because of that, he would be out of luck.

The youth wielded a sword, which was incredibly fast and extraordinarily sharp. Previously, he had delivered a series of consecutive sword strikes and severed his opponent’s weapon. The final strike had pierced the chest of his opponent, and if it were not for a light humph from Ding Hu that sent him backwards, his opponent would probably have become a dead corpse by now.

Crafty, vicious, and merciless.

These were the traits that Ling Han had labeled this youth with. He should have gone to be an assassin. Being a soldier was really too stifling for his talent.

As expected, this youth had even drawn Ding Hu’s attention. Though he had humphed, expressing his displeasure over how the youth had delivered a fatal strike to his companion, he could not help but cast a few more looks at this youth.

This kind of talent was worthy of bringing into the Ding Clan. If he was well nurtured, he would become a Severing Mundane Tier assassin.

Though battle prowess was an important criterion for judging elites, the world did not have the rule that elites would not die in the hands of someone weaker.

Of course, it was an absolutely impossible feat for a Genesis Tier to kill a Severing Mundane Tier, but for a first severance to kill a second severance, or even a third severance, was not just a fantasy story, and this usually happened with assassins.

No one would continuously maintain his prime battle condition at all times. There would eventually come a time of carelessness, and an excellent assassin would be able to grasp this fleeting instant, and move to kill him.

In Ding Hu’s eyes, this youth was a treasure.

Unfortunately, though he had the intention, he did not dare directly bring this youth back to the Ding Clan.

The three clans had a rule that such talents required a fair competition among the three of them. However, since it was he who had first discovered him, he could later have the clan move to investigate the weaknesses and habits of this youth so that they could take appropriate steps.

90 years later, those that had not yet been eliminated would officially join the Dark Moon Army, and these 90 years would be the time for the three great clans to use their various methods—some would promise great profits, some would simply take him into the clan as a son-in-law—and begin a competition among themselves for important talents.

Of course, there was no single person that could simultaneously gain the interest of all three clans most of the time. There were really too few prodigies.

Mao Dai, for example, had gained the admiration of who knew how many prized daughters of the three clans, yet surprisingly did not choose any one of them. However, he was also out of the control of the three great clans because of this, and maintained an absolutely independent stand. Now, he was also above worldly matters, and the three great clans were all competing to attract his interest.

The tournament battles continued. The Empress expressed that she would not compete for the position of captain. She was going to stay with Ling Han. One of the two of them definitely had to be a soldier. Otherwise, if they were in different teams, they would be in a competitive relationship.

Elites moved respectively. Only the strong would be respected in the army. If you had defeated your opponent when he was completely exhausted, then even if you became a captain, who among your subordinates would truly respect you?

Mao Shuyu had also joined the battle. She was at the consummate level of the Genesis Tier, and also had three stars’ aptitude, so her battle prowess was extremely strong. She easily obtained the position of defending champion.

“I’ll go then.” Ling Han released the Empress’s hand reluctantly.

“En.” The Empress nodded gently, her eyes enchanting.

Ling Han leaped and arrived in front of a person.

It was Ding Xiaochen.

“Huh?”

“Hmm?”

“Ah?”

Seeing that Ling Han had actually gone to challenge Ding Xiaochen, a considerable number of people exclaimed in shock.

Previously, those who had challenged Ding Xiaochen had all been defeated terribly, and now it was almost an hour’s time since the last person had challenged him. It looked like he was just about to become the first person that would not need three days’ time to become captain, yet Ling Han had thrown a wrench into his plans.

This time, Ding Xiaochen would at least have to wait for another hour.

Why had he challenged Ding Xiaochen? Was he trying to make things difficult for him?

Ding Xiaochen was also slightly surprised, but then he showed a menacing expression. Previously, he had not managed to get a chance; he had not thought that Ling Han would actually deliver himself right into his hands. He really was courting death.

If it had been the other vice commanders from the other clans, Ding Xiaochen would be stopped even if he wanted to deliver a fatal strike, but would Ding Hu stop him?

Ding Xiaochen smirked coldly. “I have to say, you are incomparably stupid!”

“Your mouth stinks, have you forgotten to rinse your mouth when you woke up?” Ling Han said slowly. If it was a verbal battle, he really feared no one.

“The more stubborn your mouth is now, the worse your suffering will be later!” Ding Xiaochen’s lips slowly curled. Faced with a man that was about to die, his self-restraint was still quite good, and he did not lose composure just because he was egged on.

“Hoho.” Ling Han laughed, expressing all his disdain in this derisive laugh.

Even if Ding Xiaochen was trained in restraint, he easily exploded in fury because of this condescending laugh. His expression was filled with rage, and he forced himself to take a few deep breaths, telling himself that there was no need to drop down to the level of this brat, and he just had to kill him.

“You are asking for your own suffering!” He moved, and pressed out a palm. Boom, Origin Power solidified into a giant hand, a black sun shining on every fingertip, which looked incredibly bizarre.

Ling Han puffed up his cheeks and blew. With an exhalation, those five suns were all extinguished, and this giant hand also turned back into Origin Power which then dissipated.

This...!

Everyone was shocked, as if they had just discovered Ling Han’s presence, and surveyed him continuously.

Was this really a cultivator in the high extreme of the Genesis Tier? He had not even reached the peak stage yet; at most, he could only be in the late stage.

Three and a half stars’ aptitude was really so frightening?

Even Ding Hu couldn’t help but open his eyes as he surveyed Ling Han.

Actually, with his strength, it was the same whether he opened his eyes or not. Wherever his divine sense could reach, he could see. But because this scene was too shocking, he was emotionally stirred, and opened his eyes once more.

Ding Xiaochen also looked at Ling Han in shock. He did not dare believe that his move had been so simply and easily resolved.

Was this three and a half stars aptitude? Allowing him to oppose him even with the gap of a minor level between them?

F***, was it that exaggerating?

He took a deep breath, and told himself not to be affected. He had yet to use any secret technique. If he used it, how easy would it be to suppress a high extreme Genesis Tier?

“You’ve got some skill, but in front of me, putting aside the fact that you are only in the high extreme, even if you were in the consummate level, you would still be suppressed!”

Pa!

Just when Ding Xiaochen had finished his words, he received a harsh slap.

It naturally was delivered by Ling Han.

This was definitely deliberate. He had waited until Ding Xiaochen finished speaking to slap him. This face slap was really painful and loud.

Ding Xiaochen roared out angrily. His hair fluttered, his eyes becoming completely white like blazing lightning. This time, he was really and truly in a thunderous rage. Having his face slapped in public like this, how could he endure anymore?

“Die!” he shouted loudly, his whole person being engulfed in the power of time, and charged towards Ling Han. He was going to crush this damn guy!
