3060 You Want to Kill Me?

Wang Quanhe raised a brow, and revealed a strong confidence. “Why?”

“If I told you to stay, just stay. Why are you asking so many questions?!” the guard said impatiently.

Wang Quanhe thought for a moment, and couldn’t help but come to a realization. “Is it Lei Dong?”

The only person he had offended here was Lei Dong. There was no need for others to take a “little beggar” like him to account.

“Since you know that you’ve offended Young Master Lei, you still want to leave?” the guard said, not even looking Wang Quanhe in the eye.

“Alright, I’ll wait for him,” Wang Quanhe said.

Since Lei Dong was asking for a beating, Wang Quanhe would oblige him. Although the Lei Clan still had elites surpassing Dividing Soul Tier, didn’t Wang Quanhe still have Ling Han behind him?

Not to mention anything else, just Prince Ma Xuan alone was enough to make the Lei Clan not even dare to fart.

Not long after, Lei Dong ran over.

“Little beggar, you’re really good at hiding!” Lei Dong was a little surprised. Seven days ago, he had been guarding the entrance of Prince Xuan’s Manor, but after waiting for a long time, he still hadn’t seen Wang Quanhe appear. He felt strange about this, and he couldn’t figure it out no matter how hard he tried.

Of course, he didn’t believe that Wang Quanhe was the person Prince Xuan was looking for. As expected, he had set up many spies in the city, and quickly found this little beggar.

“I told you that you would regret it!” Lei Dong attacked brazenly and struck out with his palm, intending to kill Wang Quanhe.

A hint of killing intent flashed across Wang Quanhe’s eyes as he also struck out with his palm.

Peng! Lei Dong instantly turned into a rain of blood.

A Severing Mundane Tier standing against a Dividing Soul Tier would naturally die in one move.

Although seven days had passed in the outside world, Wang Quanhe had undergone almost 10 years of bitter cultivation under the acceleration of time. As his strength increased, his mentality had also changed.

He was decisive and resolute. This was the temperament he had cultivated with Ling Han.

Wang Quanhe did not even give him a second glance. He only said to the guard, “Are you still going to stop me?”

The guard’s entire body trembled as he hurriedly shook his head. He didn’t want to die.

“That’s good then.” Wang Quanhe turned around and walked out of the city.

The guard was still filled with lingering fear. After being in a daze for a while, he finally remembered to report to the Lei Clan.

An outstanding member of the Lei Clan had died, and he was a witness. If he didn’t report it, he would definitely be skinned alive by the Lei Clan.

When the news reached them, the Lei Clan was naturally enraged.

Lei Qianxing, who was also Lei Dong’s father, immediately rushed out, wanting to capture Wang Quanhe and kill him in front of his son’s grave.

He was an Ascending Origin Tier, so his speed was extremely fast. With a flash, he had arrived at the city gate.

Looking at the bloodstains on the ground, he couldn’t help but feel great grief, and tears streamed down his face.

He only had one son.

“How dare you kill my son? Not only will I cut your corpse into pieces, but I will also find and kill all of your relatives within nine generations!” Lei Qianxing said viciously.

“Sigh!” A sigh suddenly sounded.

“Who is it!” Lei Qianxing was shocked. He didn’t realize that there was another person nearby. With his Ascending-Origin-Tier power, most people would have fled far away in fear. How could anyone get so close?

Ling Han slowly walked out, and said, “Let the younger generation settle their own matters. Why are you interfering?”

He was Wang Quanhe’s ancestor. How could he watch Lei Qianxing hunt down his descendant? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lei Qianxing sized up Ling Han, and couldn’t help but frown slightly. He couldn’t see through Ling Han’s strength, but he was certain that Ling Han definitely wasn’t a Celestial King—Celestial Kings had ribbons of iridescent light twining around their bodies, and this was the most obvious characteristic.

Since he wasn’t a Celestial King, he was at most an Ascending Origin Tier like him. What was there to be afraid of?

“Judging from your tone, you seem to be the elder of the murderer who killed my son,” he asked.

Ling Han nodded. “That’s right.”

“Alright, then I’ll kill you first!” Lei Qianxing’s gaze turned cold, and killing intent surged.

“Stop!” He was just about to move when he suddenly heard a shout, causing him to stop abruptly. A look of surprise appeared on his face, and he blurted out, “Lord Celestial King!”

There was only one Lord Celestial King here, and that was Prince Ma Xuan.

The Lei Clan was an Ascending-Origin-Tier force. They were already very powerful, but in front of a Celestial-King-Tier force, they were completely trash. If Prince Ma Xuan really wanted to make a move on the Lei Clan, he could easily destroy the Lei Clan.

Therefore, Lei Qianxing immediately became extremely respectful. He cupped his hands and bowed to Prince Ma Xuan. “Greetings, Lord Ma!”

However, what happened next made Lei Qianxing’s face turn green.

Prince Ma Xuan jogged over, and knelt down in front of Ling Han. “This lowly one’s rule was not strict enough, and actually caused offense to you, milord. Please forgive me, milord!”

‘Holy! F*ck!’

Lei Qianxing’s face was filled with incredulity. That was a Celestial King, the most powerful being in the world, yet he actually knelt down and addressed this person as a lord, as if he was incomparably humble.

If he had heard about this, he would definitely have laughed out loud and dismissed it as ridiculous. He would have treated it as a joke.

However, when this scene happened before his eyes, Lei Qianxing only felt a bone-chilling coldness.

Even a Celestial King had to kneel and pay his respects, so who was this incomparably young man?

He couldn’t help but feel his legs go weak, and he directly knelt down. He wanted to call out “lord,” but he couldn’t say anything.

It was too terrifying.

Ling Han merely smiled faintly, and said, “Milord, please don’t interfere in the affairs of the younger generation, alright?”

“Alright! Alright! Alright!” Lei Qianxing finally found some courage, because judging from Ling Han’s words, it seemed like he didn’t want to make things difficult for the Lei Clan and him anymore. Naturally, he felt as if a huge burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He only felt that his back was covered in cold sweat, and his clothes were drenched.

Ling Han nodded, turned around, and left.

When Ling Han’s figure disappeared, Lei Qianxing’s entire body was paralyzed, and he flopped down on the ground.

Pa! He was immediately slapped. Prince Ma Xuan was glaring at him fiercely, as if he wanted him to swallow him alive.

“Milord…” Lei Qianxing’s heart skipped a beat.

“You bastard, I was almost killed by you!” Prince Ma Xuan flew into a rage, and gave him a good beating.

Naturally, Lei Qianxing could only scream in pain. He didn’t even dare to defend himself.

Fortunately, when Prince Ma Xuan saw that Ling Han had spared him, he did not dare to beat Lei Qianxing to death. What if one day Ling Han had a sudden impulse, and said that he wanted to personally deal with Lei Qianxing? Wouldn’t Ma Xuan be in trouble then?

“Scram!” In the end, Prince Ma Xuan kicked Lei Qianxing away. Out of sight, out of mind.

It could be said that Lei Qianxing had escaped death twice, and dragged his heavily injured body back to the Lei Clan. In his heart, he was still thinking about how lucky he was to be able to survive being targeted by a Celestial King and someone many times stronger than a Celestial King. This was really not easy.

At the thought of this, he actually felt a little smug.

“Seventh Elder, what’s wrong?” Seeing Lei Qianxing return bathed in blood, it was obvious that he was in an extremely miserable state. The members of the Lei Clan were all shocked.

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Lei Qianxing hurriedly waved his hand. He naturally couldn’t take the initiative to bring up his scandal. He came up with some story, and then closed the page on this matter.
