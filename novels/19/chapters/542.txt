Previously, in the battle royale between the three of them, there was practically no difference in their battle prowess. Of course, Ling Han had not used ultimate techniques like the Mysterious Three Thousand, but he was sure that these two must have held their punches as well. There were some secret techniques that would only be used in a life-or-death situation.

Yet Lang Wu Xin admitted honestly that he was no match for Xuanyuan Zi Guang, which showed that not only was the latter stronger, he was stronger by a significant degree, which was the only reason that a proud man like Lang Wu Xin would admit his inferiority.

“That guy is indeed very powerful,” Fei Hong agreed with a nod. “However, he has the advantage in cultivation level as he is already in the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier. If we battled on the same cultivation level... I am confident that I will not lose to him.”

“No, even if we fought on the same cultivation level, we are no match against him, either.” Lang Wu Xin shook his head in disagreement.

“You have never fought him before,” Fei Hong declared defiantly.

“We won’t win unless we are able to break through our own limitations. Otherwise, if we merely advance another few cultivation layers, it would still be insufficient to overcome the gap in battle prowess that stands between us and him. Han Lin, on the other hand, may be qualified to fight with Xuanyuan Zi Guang—but only when the two of you are on the same cultivation level. Otherwise, the result will still be defeat,” Lang Wu Xin said with absolute certainty.

This time, Fei Hong yielded. He said, “Brother Han is only in the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier yet is already able to battle us to a tie. Indeed, his battle prowess is more outstanding than ours. This also tells us that we should never be complacent. We had originally thought that we had already polished our battle prowess sufficiently, yet had never thought that there would be another person stronger. Brother Han is even more of a monster than we are.”

“Could Xuanyuan Zi Guang come from some ancient great sect that he’s so strong?” Ling Han felt slight disbelief.

“His origins are mysterious; no one knows his true history. However, I have fought him before, and his bloodline is very powerful. It granted him a power upgrade of three Battle Stars,” Lang Wu Xin said in a tone of absolute certainty.

Three Stars!

One shouldn’t underestimate these three Stars of battle prowess. For geniuses like them, they had more or less advanced their battle prowess to the limit, and the ability to add another three Battle Stars to this maximum level would naturally be enough to turn the tables around in any battle.

Lang Wu Xin paused, then continued, “If he did not use his bloodline ability, and fought with me on the same cultivation level, his battle prowess should be similar to mine. But if he did compound his battle prowess with his bloodline, then he is more powerful than I.”

Ling Han nodded. There were really too many capable people in this world; he definitely could not allow himself to fall into a state of self-satisfaction. Being stagnant and not moving forwards would be equivalent to an endless decline.

“Brother Han, let us meet once more in the middle state!” When Fei Hong and Lang Wu Xin had drunk to their heart’s content, they bade Ling Han farewell. “After this battle with you, we feel tremendous pressure. We need to find a dangerous spot to have a good bloody battle. If we don’t die, our battle prowess would be greatly improved, and then, we’ll find you again. Let us learn from each other once more.”

“Good!” Ling Han agreed gladly. Geniuses were never as grand as what the masses imagined them to be; what genius had gotten to the level they were at without risking their lives in the process?

The two men took to the skies, but they both left in a different direction. Most probably, the only beings that could push them to the limit would have to be in the Spiritual Infant Tier. Either they would choose to trifle with demonic beasts of this level or powerful human cultivators, all to squeeze out their own potential through a life-or-death battle, raising their own cultivation and battle prowess.

“Ai!” Ying Hong immediately sighed. “I had initially thought that we had a high chance of winning in the martial arts competition, but never thought that there would suddenly appear so many monsters! Really, I’m about to die of fury; can’t you people appear a year later?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “I’ll recommend you an elite cultivator. I guarantee that Xuanyuan Zi Guang whatever would only be swept aside in the wake.”

“Oh, you won’t say it’s you, right?” Ying Hong looked at him with an expression filled with doubt. “I’ve already told you, I can only afford to pay you a thousand Triple Star Origin Crystals in wages. If you want any more, then I can only pay you with my body!”

“Get lost!” Ling Han rolled his eyes. “The elite cultivator that I’m referring to is her.” He pointed at Helian Xun Xue.

Pu!

Ying Hong instantly choked on her own saliva; what kind of joke was that?

Helian Xun Xue, too, looked shy and bashful, hiding herself behind Ling Han. Her two slender hands grasped tightly onto the corner of Ling Han’s shirt as if she was really scared that Ling Han would really sell her off.

Ling Han sighed. This was the real pro at showing off.

After another few days, they reached the well-known Region Barrier.

It was a transparent barrier so high its top was hidden in clouds. Everyone guessed that this barrier had been created by an array, but no one had ever found any formation’s eyes. Thus, this was a mere guess.

The Region Barrier separated the middle state and the other four great regions, as if separating the landmass into five boxes. It also allowed for the fact that the martial arts level in every region was completely different. The Region Barrier did not have the slightest effect on the common people, but the stronger one’s power, the more one would be affected. If a Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator passed through, not only would his cultivation level experience a temporary drop, his life source itself would be considerably decreased.

Thus, if one wanted to traverse the world, it was best to do so as early as possible. The best cultivation level was the Flower Blossom Tier; not only did one not have to fear being harmed by the Region Barrier, one’s ability would also be strong enough for self-defense.

The Region Barrier stretched up into the skies as if there was no end to it.

“What is at the end of the skies?” Ling Han asked.

“The end of the skies? Maybe the legendary realm of immortals,” Ying Hong answered.

Ling Han shook his head. In his last life, he had once flew up into the skies continuously, but very soon encountered a terrifyingly strong wind that not even a Heaven Tier cultivator could withstand. He could only choose to helplessly give up the idea of wanting to see what lay at the end of the skies.

“One day, I will definitely sever this sky, and see clearly for myself!” he declared grandly. Shattering Void Tier cultivators shattered the void and became immortals; did that mean to shatter apart something like the end of the sky?

Weng!

All of a sudden, the fair weather immediately changed. It actually became darkened abruptly before a dark cloud rapidly appeared, with terrifying lightning flashing within.

Thunder Tribulation?

That couldn’t be, right? How could a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator actually attract a calamity of thunder? Aside from alchemical calamities, it was rumored that only when one broke through to the Shattering Void Tier would one incite a calamity of thunder.

Within the dark clouds, an incredibly bizarre sight was seen. A single eye appeared. It was as gigantic as a mountain, and was staring down at where Ling Han and the others were standing.

Ling Han was absolutely sure that the one this eye was focusing on was himself. And even if he had a sliver of divine sense of Heaven Tier, at this moment, he still felt the urge to flee inside the Black Tower. The pressure was too terrifying, making him feel as if his soul itself was about to explode.

However, he did not want to flee. This eye did not have any killing intent and only held endless disdain, as if it was mocking him.

The Eye of Heavenly Dao!

Ling Han was internally shocked. He had read from ancient scrolls before that if a mortal said something rebellious, or did something that could possibly affect the balance of the world, the Eye of Heavenly Dao would appear as a warning or even directly kill the offender.

Of course, it was not as if any random person cursing would incite the appearance of the Eye of Heavenly Dao; that person had to indeed have the potential to shake the universal balance of the world. Only then would the Eye of Heavenly Dao appear. Who knew, it might even make a direct move to erase a factor that could possibly be a liability to itself in the future.

Could it be that when he said he wanted to sever the skies one day, he had actually given a scare to the world? Furthermore, there was a possibility that he could succeed in future?

Really, what an optimisic opinion of him!

“Ugly, get lost, Niu doesn’t like you!” Hu Niu jumped up onto the roof of the carriage with her hands on her hips, looking very fierce.

When the Eye of Heavenly Dao turned to look at Hu Niu, it was very obvious that slight fear actually appeared in its gaze. Suddenly, the dark clouds turned and flipped, covering the eyeball before quickly disappearing altogether. When the dark cloud had completely dispersed, the Eye of Heavenly Dao had also disappeared.

F***, was it really chased off by Hu Niu’s scolding?
