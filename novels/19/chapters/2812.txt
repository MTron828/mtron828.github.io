2813 Flee in panic

“I have no time to waste on you,” Ling Han said as he resolutely channeled the Eighth Seal.

Boom, a surge of power exploded out of him. The Eighth Seal could increase his battle prowess by 27 times, just what kind of concept was this?

The Ninth Seal could only do so by 15 times.

“What?!” Ping Xinghai couldn’t help exclaiming. He was too surprised to find that Ling Han’s battle prowess could still be increased.

!!

Th-th-this, obviously the secret technique being used by the other party had not changed!

Could it be that… he had also mastered another Heavenly Venerable Seal, and it was of an even higher level than the previous one?

Peng!

Ping Xinghai was only absent-minded for a brief moment, and immediately suffered a punch. The impact caused him to be cast several kilometers away. He could only feel the boiling sensation in his chest, and blood spilled from the corner of his mouth.

Ling Han did not follow up on his assault to deliver another blow, but turned his gaze to Hong Huang, his killing intent rising.

“Brother Situ, Brother Ma, save me!” Hong Huang hurriedly asked for help from the Second Tier Heavenly Venerates. He naturally knew that even if it was an ordinary First Tier Heavenly Venerate who made a move against him, it would be impossible for him to equally match the opponent, not to mention that Ling Han was the enemy this time, and was so outrageously strong. Hong Huang would be blasted to smithereens in a single blow.

The expressions of those two Second Tier Heavenly Venerates revealed their awkwardness, with them being somewhat trapped in a dilemma.

If they were to act, they wouldn’t be able to stop Ling Han at all, and would just be asking for humiliation themselves, but if they did not take action, then were they supposed to just watch their companion being bullied or even killed?

“Ling Han, please give us some face,” a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate said. “My teacher is a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, Guo Junjie. I will remember this favor of yours.”

Another Second Tier Heavenly Venerate also said, “My ancestor is the Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate by the name of Liu Yi. I sincerely ask Brother Ling to show some mercy.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They all brought up their powerful backers, knowing that it was impossible to make Ling Han bow his head based on their own merits.

Ling Han chuckled. “So when I don’t give you face, you will bring up the Fourth Tier and Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates to suppress me? Sigh, I don’t have a precedent of giving rubbish face, not this time, nor in the future!”

WIth a stretch of his hand, Ling Han instantly captured Hong Huang. How was it possible for a Second Tier to be able to stop him?

Xiu, Ping Xinghai leapt back towards them, his face full of malice.

To be honest, it was possible for him and Ling Han to be equally matched in a fight. Given that the time for the Heavenly Venerable Seal to release energy was limited, as long as he could endure it, he was completely capable of gaining the upper hand with the secret technique that he had mastered.

However, gaining the upper hand was one thing, and being able to suppress Ling Han was another matter altogether.

Besides, what if he wasn’t able to survive through Ling Han’s explosion of power?

Thinking about it this way, he only desired to obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal that Ling Han had more. If he could master it, how powerful would his battle prowess be then?

The question was: could he do it?

“Hong Huang, where is the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable right now?” Ling Han asked, lifting up Hong Huang.

Before, this would have been easy as the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had to be on the fourth spatial level of the Realm Battlefield. However, presently there was only the eighth spatial level in the Realm Battlefield, and with the Genesis World being so vast, where could Ling Han go to locate him?

Hong Huang gazed at Ling Han coldly, and said, “If you want to kill me, then do it. But if you think that I’ll betray my master, you’re dreaming!” He had great reverence for the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. The latter wasn’t just a teacher to him, but was equivalent to a god.

Ling Han nodded. “Although I find your behavior shameless, at least you have some shining points.”

“Humph, what’s the point of such talk!” Hong Huang raised his neck. He didn’t care about being spared or killed, because the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable carried a mark of his life, so even if he were to die, it wouldn’t matter. As long as the Sealed Emotion was still alive, Hong Huang could be resurrected once again.

Therefore, he was able to have no regard for his life and confront Ling Han head-on.

“Okay, I’ll send you off then!” Ling Han’s grip tightened, and suddenly Hong Huang’s neck was tilted at a crooked angle. He died on the spot.

“Committing murder right in my face, you are really arrogant!” Ping Xinghai said sternly. He was extremely angry.

Ling Han smiled. “Okay, let me ask, who among you wants to be my enemy?” His gaze swept across the crowd. With the exception of Ping Xinghai, no one dared to look at him as they all lowered their heads.

“Ha! Ha!” Ping Xinghai sneered, causing the people behind him to feel chills down their spine.

“Do you dare to fight?” he asked the people behind him.

Those people hesitated for a moment before saying, “We will go all the way with Brother Ping.”

Only then did Ping Xinghai nod his head. “With me restraining him, he won’t be able to hurt you. Once his Heavenly Venerable Seal has been released completely, we can take him down.”

“Yes.” Everyone nodded.

Ling Han shook his head. “Since all of you insist on a fight, then I’ll fulfill your wish.”

“Let’s go!” Ping Xinghai rushed over first, unleashing a shot towards Ling Han. He had to restrain Ling Han, otherwise the five of them would definitely be killed in an instant if Ling Han was allowed to unleash his might.

“You have overestimated your own abilities!” Ling Han snorted, and he also unleashed a shot at full strength.

Peng!

He had boosted himself with the Eighth Seal, and his battle prowess was extremely terrifying. With a single kick, he sent Ping Xinghai flying away. Although he didn’t manage to hurt the other party, it also made him fly backwards for more than a few kilometers.

Having drawn out the distance at this moment, Ling Han immediately went charging murderously towards Lu Xuanting and the others.

He showed no mercy. Since he had already made a move, he would kill them..

Peng!

With just a single punch, a First Tier Heavenly Venerate was blasted into smithereens. He didn’t even have the qualifications to let Ling Han know his name.

“Damn it!” Ping Xinghai came charging back murderously, with his face showing a furious expression. He had even made a declaration just earlier that as long as he had Ling Han restrained, then everything would be fine.

However, he had barely finished speaking those words, and a lackey was instantly killed. How embarrassing for him; how could he face the crowd?

He turned his anger into strength, and attacked Ling Han frantically.

Ling Han was indifferent to it. He casually countered the attacks, and he sent Ping Xinghai flying with a kick once again after a few blows.

“F*ck!” Ping Xinghai couldn’t help cursing when he was sent flying again, his cultivation level and confidence notwithstanding. Within the past hour, Ling Han’s battle prowess had an absolute advantage over his, so he had no problem defending himself, but intending to stop Ling Han from committing murder was truly wishful thinking.

He was too optimistic, thinking that he could stop Ling Han.

Sure enough, Ling Han punched out again, and blasted Lu Xuanting into smithereens.

Once he had made a move, he was absolutely merciless.

...

“Retreat! Retreat!” Ping Xinghai came back to prevent Ling Han from killing any further.

He was able to block Ling Han at this point. Although it was only a few moves, a Heavenly Venerate would only need this little bit of time to escape.

The remaining three quickly dispersed.

In fact, there was no need for Ping Xinghai to shout it, as they were already planning to retreat. Although they had reverence for Ping Xinghai and his master, who was a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, it was absolutely impossible for them to risk their own lives for this.

Ping Xinghai blocked a few moves, and was sent flying by a kick from Ling Han once again. However, in such a brief moment, those three had fled without a trace.

He laughed out loud. This was the first time that he had gained an upper hand after fighting for so long, although such an upper hand was indeed too pitiful.

“Ling Han, you have already shown off your ability and offended too many people. You will have a miserable end!” Ping Xinghai said. All three people who were killed by Ling Han had powerful backers, with their masters or elders being at least Third Tier Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han shook his head. “You should take care of yourself first!”

He charged forward murderously. No matter what, he was determined to beat up this guy and teach him a lesson.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

He kept kicking. He kicked Ping Xinghai around like a ball.

...

Ping Xinghai was about to explode from anger. However, there was nothing he could do about it given the difference in strength. Since the lackeys had already fled, and he had no intention to continue fighting, what was the point in him getting a thrashing?

He feigned launching another attack, then turned around, and disappeared.
