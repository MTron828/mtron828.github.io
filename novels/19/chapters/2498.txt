Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Demanding for the nation leaders to get over here and pay their respects?

Hiss, this was too arrogant! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All the envoys were furious. They admitted that Zhao Xin indeed had an elite on his side, and they could not afford to trifle with him, but it should be known that there were Heavenly Body Tier overlords here. What kind of concept was that?

If they went into a rage, that would be enough power to destroy a whole planet!

You actually dared to trifle with such an elite?

“Are you guys getting lost or not?” Zhao Xin rebuked harshly.

When these words fell, all the envoys suddenly realized that their mobility had recovered. Suddenly losing control, they immediately rushed out.

They did not dare to stop. Zhao Xin’s party being arrogant was their business, and the only thing they had to do was to relay the message. In any case, judging by the present situation, they could not afford to trifle with him, so they might as well not interfere.

Everyone fled swiftly, and they all disappeared very quickly.

“Milord, your body…” Zhao Xin looked towards Ling Han. Throughout all these years, Ling Han’s condition did not improve or worsen—actually, it could not become any worse. His whole body was close to rotting completely, so how much worse could it get?

Ling Han sent out a message through divine sense. “I’m fine.”

Only he himself knew that he had already removed 29 shards of great dao. However, the number of shards of great dao in his body numbered in the thousands, so the improvement in his condition was not very apparent.

In the next few days, the Eternal Heart Land was unusually peaceful, as if the sky had not been opened at all. It was still a small world, and Zhao Xin alone was enough to suppress all others in this world.

But everyone knew that this was the final calm before the storm, and the peace would very soon be shattered.

True enough, by the seventh day, various forces arrived in quick succession.

There were great generals and there were also minor generals from various nations.

The great generals had been sent by smaller nations, while the minor generals were sent from greater nations, and their cultivation levels were all at the Sun Moon Tier.

…Since Mountain River Tiers could not deal with the problem, then they would deploy Sun Moon Tiers.

Heavenly Body Tiers were too high and noble; how could they arrive with just a summons from Ling Han? Did he think that they were courtesans from the brothel?

These elites were already terrifying enough. Without a Heavenly Body Tier elite on guard, who could match their combined power?

Thus, these people came grandly, all of them unleashing their auras without reservation. This was astonishingly frightening.

Indeed. They had come to show off. The first batch of envoys had actually been frightened into fleeing in panic. No matter what, they naturally had to wash off this humiliation.

They came aggressively, and went all the way to the Imperial Palace. Then, they began to reprove harshly, demanding that Zhao Xin come out to greet them.

Going along with what Ling Han had previously said, Zhao Xin brought these people to the ancestral grounds again.

‘Are you bringing us to worship your ancestors?’ The second batch of envoys already knew what kind of place this was, and their expressions were all livid.

When they arrived, these Sun Moon Tier elites sneered. One of them moved, and struck out at these ancestral grounds. Instantly, the sun and moon revealed their brilliance simultaneously, dazzling light surging in all directions. It was like a sun and moon had fallen, dropping thunderously from the skies.

This scene was a little astounding. In the Celestial Realm, a Sun Moon Tier was not worth much, but in the Ancient Realm, they could just manage to be ranked among elites. The might of their attack was frightening.

Zhao Xin couldn’t even move. Under the heavy pressure of Sun Moon Tier aura, it was already impressive enough that he could remain standing.

Yet, this strike did not manage to land. That sun and moon both stopped above the ancestral grounds. It was as if a sun and moon had appeared out of nowhere, illuminating the area brightly.

All the envoys felt their scalps go numb. This definitely was not something that a Sun Moon Tier could do!

Could it be that there was actually a Heavenly Body Tier elite standing behind Zhao Xin?

“Scram!” A voice filled with authority rang out in their minds, causing their minds to suddenly go blank. Their only thought was to turn around and return. Only when they returned to their respective nations did they finally come back to their senses. Involuntarily, they couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat, and almost passed out again.

In the Eternal Heart Land, Ling Han sent a message through divine sense to Zhao Xin. “Prepare a carriage, and bring me around all these nations.”

Zhao Xin did not ask what Ling Han intended to do, nor did he dare to. He merely obeyed the command and did as required.

He personally took the position of coachman, and began traveling to the nations one after another based on how far away they were.

Every time they reached a nation, Ling Han would have him drive the carriage directly into the imperial palace. So what if there were people obstructing them? They could not even make a single move.

Ling Han had an “intimate” conversation with every single nation leader, and the effects were naturally obvious. These nation leaders willingly chose Zhao Xin as their common leader.

All the Heavenly Body Tier elites listened obediently. They could sense an extremely terrifying aura from Ling Han, and thought that Ling Han was a Genesis Tier overlord.

After dealing with all these minor problems, Ling Han continued to recover. Occasionally, he would also guide Zhao Xin, and teach him new skills of alchemy.

Time passed swiftly, and 30,000 years passed in a flash.

Pa!

Ling Han had finally expelled the last shard of great dao from within his body, Immediately, a frightening power surged fiercely, and boundless light shone from the ancestral grounds of the Zhao Clan. In fact, even space itself had been ripped, and the Celestial Realm could just be seen vaguely.

If he wanted to return to the Celestial Realm, he merely had to take a single step.

Ling Han did not do this. He stood up, all the shattered bones in his body beginning to join back up again.?Pa, pa, pa,?golden light filled the area, turning into one seal after another. Then, his flesh and skin recovered, and there was not the slightest sign of any wounds left.

His injuries were very heavy, but they were mainly heavy due to the shards of great dao. Now that the shards of great dao had been removed, he could immediately heal his body.

“My grasp of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll has actually increased a bit!”

Ling Han was surprised. These few tens of thousands of years, he had been battling with the shards of great dao, and the conflict did not stop for an instant. The strongest weapon against the shards of great dao was naturally the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. It was being channeled at all times. The shards of great dao were hard to get rid of, but it was also because of this that he had to find out the deepest, most profound secrets of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

“Is this a blessing in disguise?”

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile in spite of himself. The strength of his present physique had reached the height of the Second Heaven. Initially, it would have taken an ocean’s worth of resources and an astounding amount of time to attain this level.

“En, the shards of great dao can be considered a type of energy as well, but this process… Just how many could bear it?”

Ling Han thought back to how he would be pierced by the shards of great dao at all these times throughout these tens of thousands of years. That kind of agony caused him to involuntarily break out in a cold sweat.

‘I definitely do not want a second experience!’ he thought.

Xiu, xiu, xiu.?Multiple figures shot forth. They were Zhao Xin and the other great nation leaders.

Ling Han would teach Zhao Xin occasionally, and afterwards one of the nation leaders came as well. Seeing that Ling Han had actually not dismissed him, and he had really been taught, the other nation leaders naturally came too. In fact, they had all moved into the ancestral grounds of the Zhao Clan.

Though only a few tens of thousands of years had passed, Zhao Xin’s cultivation level had already reached the Heavenly Body Tier, and there were a few veteran Heavenly Body Tiers that would have hopes of advancing to the Eternal River Tier.

They were filled with incredible respect towards Ling Han. When they discovered that a sudden bizarre event had happened here, they naturally all came over to investigate.

“Mi-milord!” When they saw Ling Han, everyone was dumbfounded.

Their impression of Ling Han was a dying man, but what about now?

His build was lanky and tall, hair flowing straight to his waist, every single strand inky black and shimmering, as if they were forged from Godly metal. His skin was radiant, as if he was great dao itself. The mere sight of him made one want to bow down in worship.

“Congratulations on your recovery, milord!” Zhao Xin said immediately, his expression filled with pleasant surprise.

He couldn’t help but think back to his youth. Ling Han had always been severely injured, and he had finally recovered after several tens of thousands of years had passed, which made him feel rueful.

“Hahahaha, a peculiar light has appeared. Could it be that a precious treasure has appeared in this place?” Amidst loud laughter, another person appeared in the courtyard. He was of sturdy, tall build, and exuded a frightening air of bloodshed.
