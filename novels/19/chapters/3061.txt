3062 Collecting Debts

“Wang Quanhe, why aren’t you hiding in some ravine for the rest of your life? How dare you come here?” A young man sneered. Xiu! He jumped out.

His name was Li Bing, and he was the only son of an elder of the Li Clan. He was already an Eternal River Tier.

He knew that Wang Quanhe was only a Heavenly Body Tier, so he was naturally happy to jump out at this time. This could be considered as standing up for Li Jingchu. This clan sister of his was not simple. When she entered the Red Flame Sect in the future, she would be a disciple of a Celestial-King-Tier sect, and her future would be limitless.

Therefore, this favor he had done for her would be very important.

Wang Quanhe glanced at him. A mere Eternal River Tier was naturally not worthy of his attention.

However, all members of the Li Clan deserved to die.

He clearly remembered that in the battle that day, the Li Clan had all been mobilized. This Li Bing’s hands were definitely stained with the blood of the Wang Family.

“How many members of the Wang Clan have you killed?” Wang Quanhe asked balefully.

Li Bing guffawed. He wanted to show off a little more, so he didn’t make a move immediately. Instead, he counted with his fingers. “One, two, three, four… at least 10. I killed them so happily that I didn’t have time to count them.”

Wang Quanhe nodded. “Alright, I’ll cut you into 10 pieces before letting you die.”

“You really think of yourself as someone important,” Li Bing said with a cold smile. He charged towards Wang Quanhe. Just fooling around with such a small fry a bit was enough. He didn’t want to make the other clansmen unhappy.

Wang Quanhe stretched out his hand, but he didn’t seem to have used any ingenious techniques. However, Li Bing looked like he was possessed as he crashed into Wang Quanhe, and his neck fell directly into Wang Quanhe’s hand.

This…

He was taken down in one move.

Wang Quanhe raised his hand and slashed out a cold light. Then, Li Bing’s legs were chopped off.

“Ah!” Li Bing screamed.

His legs had been cut off, so it was only natural that he was in so much pain that tears flowed out of his eyes.

Wang Quanhe raised his hand and delivered another palm strike. Li Bing lost another part of his body, and this time, it was severed at the knee.

However, since both of his legs were already severed, the amount of blood he spat out this time was much less.

“Ah!” Li Bing continued to scream miserably. His face was covered in great beads of cold sweat, and he was in so much pain that he was about to faint. However, he remembered what Wang Quanhe had said earlier—that he had to be cut into 10 pieces before he could die. He couldn’t help but feel like his heart was about to explode.

“Evil creature, you actually dare to commit murder in my Li Clan’s territory?” One of the Li Clan’s big shots finally spoke. He raised his eyebrows, and revealed a furious expression.

The previous scene had happened too suddenly. Who would have thought that a minor character who was only at Heavenly Body Tier would actually be able to defeat an Eternal River Tier with a single strike?

Could it be that this brat had obtained some sort of fortuitous encounter?

Was there someone more powerful behind him?

It was precisely because of these thoughts that their reactions were delayed for a moment, so they actually didn’t save Li Bing immediately, causing him to suffer again.

Wang Quanhe glanced at the big shot from the Li Clan. His gaze was terrifyingly cold, causing the big shot to shiver all over. It was as if the blood in his body was about to freeze.

Wang Quanhe retracted his gaze, and waved his hand for the third time. Following Li Bing’s scream, his legs had completely disappeared.

“How dare you!!” The big shot from the Li Clan flew into a rage out of humiliation. He was actually frightened by the gaze of a junior. How embarrassing.

He roared and charged at Wang Quanhe.

He was a Severing Mundane Tier, and he instantly arrived in front of Wang Quanhe. However, Wang Quanhe merely lashed out with his leg, and the former was smashed to the ground with a thud.

F*ck!

Upon seeing this scene, everyone fell silent. Even Li Bing stopped screaming in pain, and his face was filled with shock.

That was a Severing-Mundane-Tier grand elder!

Although he was only at the first severance, he had truly stepped into the level of an immortal. In theory, his lifespan was unlimited, and he could live forever.

However, Wang Quanhe’s kick had also taken care of him.

Hiss, what kind of monster was this Wang Quanhe?

All of a sudden, everyone in the Li Clan looked as if they were facing a great enemy. Even Li Jingchu couldn’t help but lift her red veil and look at the young man who was emitting killing intent. The entire hall was enveloped by that cold aura.

Luo Guang couldn’t help but humph. Although this was the Li Clan’s nemesis, he actually made a scene at his own wedding. This was naturally offending him greatly.

“Wang Quanhe, I’ve really underestimated you!” the clan leader of the Li Clan said. He paused for a moment. “Let him go. I promise you that I’ll let you leave freely.”

“Clan Leader!” The clansmen of the Li Clan were all unwilling. ‘He came to make a scene, and can actually leave just like that?’

The clan leader of the Li Clan waved his hand, and everyone immediately shut their mouths.

In the Li Clan, the clan leader possessed absolute authority. Firstly, he was the clan’s leader, and secondly, his cultivation level had reached the peak stage of the fourth severance. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the cultivation world, wasn’t the one with the bigger fists the one who spoke louder?

Wang Quanhe laughed loudly, but there was no smile on his face, only endless menace. He stared at the clan leader of the Li Clan, and said, “Three years ago, my Wang Clan had more than 1,000 people, and they were all slaughtered by your Li Clan in a single night. How can such a blood feud be resolved with just a few words from you?”

The clan leader of the Li Clan was not angry. He only said calmly, “Oh, so you’re here to take revenge today?”

“That’s right.” Wang Quanhe nodded and looked at Li Jingchu. “I still want to see what this b*tch’s heart is made of. She poisoned her newlywed husband’s entire clan, and now she’s wearing a wedding dress and remarrying someone else. How shameless could she be!”

“Wang Quanhe, don’t spout nonsense!” Li Jingchu couldn’t help but reprimand him. The man beside her was an important disciple of the Red Flame Sect. Her future depended on today’s marriage. If Luo Guang misunderstood or even in fact despised her, she would be finished.

“Jingchu, let me.” Luo Guang walked out. He was indeed worthy of being the successor of a Celestial-King-Tier force. He had a graceful bearing and a demeanor that Wang Quanhe couldn’t compare to.

Wang Quanhe looked at this man with indescribable complex feelings in his heart.

Although three years had passed, and it had been 10 years for him, he had loved Li Jingchu so deeply back then. How could he let go of such a relationship just like that?

The deeper the love, the deeper the hatred, and vice versa.

Wang Quanhe’s former lover, the sinner who had caused the destruction of his clan, was actually going to marry another man, and Wang Quanhe was now facing this man. Naturally, his heart was filled with mixed feelings.

However, the past could not be forgotten. Even if Li Jingchu knelt down and begged him, he would definitely not be soft-hearted.

This woman didn’t love him at all, and even destroyed the Wang Clan. From the moment she took this step, the two of them were destined to become strangers to one another.

“Kneel down and commit suicide. Your death would be easier,” Luo Guang said, but he was full of conceit. “I can guarantee that this is the right choice for you. Otherwise, you will definitely regret it.”

Wang Quanhe shifted his gaze away from him. This was an irrelevant person, and he was here for revenge today.

“Li Clan, I’m here to collect the debt today!”
