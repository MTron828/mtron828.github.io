Chapter 2052: Injuring Ji Wuming severely

Ling Han hadn’t summoned the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul previously, because the Severed Passion Sword in Ji Wuming’s hands was really too sharp, capable of severing everything. Thus, even if he had summoned the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul, it would have been meaningless.

But it was different now.

He could use the black ring to block the Severed Passion Sword, and the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul would then be able to unleash the might that he should have. Furthermore, no matter what, the Divine Demon Sword was still a Four-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool, which was enough to pose a great threat even to a Heaven Soul Tier.

‘Even if you, Ji Wuming, are a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King, just try having the Divine Demon Sword strike you once? It’s guaranteed that you will enjoy it!’

The two Ling Han joined forces in their attack against Ji Wuming.

The main body was mainly focused on defense, blocking the majority of Ji Wuming’s attacks. The black ring was completely capable of matching the sharpness of the Severed Passion Sword, and the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul would then take the opening to attack madly. As the Dividing Nine Souls struck, its might was amazingly strong.

“This has finally gotten a little interesting.” Ji Wuming was forced to retreat continuously for more than 100 steps, but not the slightest bit of shock leaked into his expression. Instead, aside from a sliver of languidness in his expression, there was finally a little seriousness.

“Fire!” he stated softly, and a sharp blade made of flames suddenly appeared in his left hand. Multiple seals of great dao could be seen flickering in the flames. His twin swords slashed out continuously, and the Severed Passion Sword in his right hand faced Ling Han’s main body, whilst the flaming sword in his left hand targeted the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul.

The flaming sword… blocked the Divine Demon Sword.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel surprised. A mere sword of flames that had formed through Regulations could block the Divine Demon Sword. This was really inconceivable.

“There is a lot more that you don’t know.” Ji Wuming smiled slightly, his twin swords slashing out rapidly, beginning a fierce counter attack.

He was incredibly aggressive, and channeled another celestial technique. The character “卐” appeared on his forehead, emanating an aura capable of suppressing eternity[1]. Without summoning a divided soul, he actually managed to battle both Ling Hans to a tie.

“Descend!” Ji Wuming exclaimed softly, his mouth spitting out a word, and boosting his power of Regulation while turning into a massive seal that pressed down on Ling Han.

Weng, it was as if this character had come from the ancient primitive times, bringing with it an endless feeling of age.

The Ji Wuming of this moment was like an invincible great emperor, capable of suppressing all with a wave of his hand.

“F*** you!” Ling Han also shouted.?Boom

, the power of Regulation he had grasped exploded, blasting out towards that “descend” character.

“Humph, in front of my Nine Figures of Truth, everything is only useless arrogance!” Ji Wuming scoffed. The “descend” character had boosted the Regulations of the Great Dao that could not be described, easily destroying everything as it continued to press down on Ling Han.

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul brandished the Divine Demon Sword, slashing out towards the “descend” character.?Qiang, the strike actually created sparks of fire from the friction, as if it was not just a seal in the air, but rather something formed from Divine Metal.

Qiang, qiang, qiang.?After repeatedly slashing a few times, a chip was finally created on this “descend” character. The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul took the initiative to charge out, and next came Ling Han. Both of them shouted loudly as they charged towards Ji Wuming.

“Force!” Ji Wuming spat out another word.

Ling Han and the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul used the same move, and used the Divine Demon Sword to hack away at the obstruction, continuing their advance.

“Fight!” Ji Wuming spat out the third word, a smirk hovering at the corners of his lips. When he spat out all the Nine Figures of Truth, it would create a qualitative change, and turn into a super strong attack. Meanwhile, he himself would accumulate power for an opportune attack. The Severed Passion Sword had already locked down on Ling Han’s neck.

By that time, the Nine Figures of Truth would also restrict the black ring, and his Severed Passion Sword would then be able to sever Ling Han’s head extremely easily.

Just like Ling Han had said, Ji Wuming had repeatedly been unable to kill Ling Han. Thus, now that this goal was about to be accomplished, he actually felt a slight feeling of anticipation, just like he felt when he had first killed a Celestial King after becoming a Celestial King himself.

His blood that had long since turned icy cold boiled slightly, and the “卐” mark appeared in both his eyes, the aura of a great emperor increasingly heavy and dense.

“One!

“All!

“Wave!

“Align!

“At!

“Front!”

When Ji Wuming spat out the final “front” word, the characters that had been broken up previously regained form from the ground and the air, and merged with the “front” character, which then turned into a streak of golden light that pressed down towards Ling Han.

This suppression felt like it was a whole world that was pressing down on Ling Han, and instantly rendered Ling Han completely incapable of movement.

His arms could not move, his legs could not move, and his head could not move!

Ji Wuming charged over, the Severed Passion Sword rapidly slashing out at Ling Han’s throat.

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul approached, but was blocked by his flaming sword. Meanwhile, the Severed Passion Sword continued its slash without the slightest bit of hesitation.

When this strike was about to reach its target, Ling Han showed a hint of a smile.

‘Hmm?’

Suddenly, Ji Wuming’s heart jolted, and a feeling of foreboding rose up in him. However, the strike was already launched, and even he could not retrieve it, and could only move with the flow.

Boom!

A frightening shock wave of power exploded from Ling Han’s body, as if it was going to destroy the heaven and earth. So what if the world’s Nine Figures of Truth had manifested? They were instantly blasted into dust. Ling Han raised a hand, protecting his throat, and the endless shock wave continued its way to surge out in all directions.

‘Sh*t!’

Ji Wuming gritted his teeth, and forcibly withdrew his left hand. The flaming sword disappeared in a flash, and his fingers pressed lightly. Instantly, the primitive aura of Time surged out.

The shock wave surged out madly, and Ling Han stumbled, suddenly spitting out three mouthfuls of golden blood. He felt as if his organs were completely boiled over, and at least 20-odd of his bones had broken.

To ensure that there was enough destructive power, Ling Han had dragged out the time to build up power for the Great Clash of Source Powers slightly, and in the end, it had caused tremendous damage even to himself.

The Nine Heavens Flame divided soul stood still, his hand wielding the Divine Demon Sword, and his eyes fixed on the far distance.

Ji Wuming was presently kneeling on one knee.?Da, da, da.?Blood was continuously dripping from his left shoulder. Upon closer look, his whole left arm was completely gone, and the robes he was wearing were torn and battered, and there were now at least a few dozen wounds on him.

His left arm had been severed by the Divine Demon Sword, while the injuries to his body had been caused by the impact from the Great Clash of Source Powers.

Previously, he had forcefully withdrawn the offensive of the Nine Heavens Flame divided soul, and unleashed a secret technique for self-protection. In the end, the Great Clash of Source Powers had not killed the person, but his left shoulder had been severed by the Divine Demon Sword.

This was the one and only time Ling Han had managed to wound Ji Wuming in their battle, but Ling Han did not look the slightest bit pleased with himself. After expending so much effort, he had also used the Great Clash of Source Powers like the explosive burst of an unexpected move, but he actually still did not manage to kill the other party.

In truth, if it were not that he had a divided soul, and had the help of the Divine Demon Sword, that attack would still not have been able to inflict a serious injury on Ji Wuming.

Why didn’t Ji Wuming use his divided soul?

Otherwise, if it had been divided soul versus divided soul, and main body versus main body, Ling Han would definitely have fallen into a disadvantage.

Ji Wuming stood up. He glanced at his empty left shoulder, and showed a rueful expression as he said, “I never thought that I had actually underestimated you, and caused myself to sustain a little injury. He, hehe, what a miscalculation.”

Ling Han did not dare be careless. Though Ji Wuming had lost an arm, and it would temporarily affect his battle prowess, for prodigies like themselves, as long as they were not completely dead, one definitely could not be careless. Who knew what kind of ultimate move would suddenly burst out of him.

Furthermore, when Ji Wuming had dispeled the blast force of the Great Clash of Source Powers, he had been clearly using the two powers of Regulations of Time and Space. Moreover, he had managed to completely fuse the two together to perfection, causing part of the attack’s force to go back to the past, a part to go to the future, a part to be sealed off by Space, and had launched out in a total of four waves.

In that manner, the might would naturally be weakened, so he would be able to save his life under such a massive blast.

“Why don’t you use your divided soul?” Ling Han asked darkly.
