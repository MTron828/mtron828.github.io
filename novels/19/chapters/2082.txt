Chapter 2083: Compensation

A hint of disdain immediately appeared at the corners of Yuan Tongguang’s lips.

Just see, he was afraid now, and was going to beg for mercy now.

However, he did not turn immediately, and wanted to keep Ling Han hanging. Who asked this guy to actually refuse his suggestion previously?

“Pay compensation!” Ling Han’s voice rang out from behind him.

‘F*ck!’

Instantly, Yuan Tongguang turned around sharply, and faced Ling Han, flames practically leaping out of his eyes in his fury.

‘What nonsense are you spouting now?’

Ling Han did not speak, and merely pointed at that table at the side… which had now become a pile of broken pieces, and the culprit was Yuan Tongguang.

Yuan Tongguang’s expression was very colourful. He had never thought that Ling Han would actually demand compensation from him for a table.

He had come from the Ancient Alchemy Tower, and had an ancestor who was a Five-Star Alchemist. His power could be considered to be appalling. To say nothing of having just destroyed a table, even if he had turned Hundred Dragons City upside down, so what? Who would dare cause trouble for him?

He felt a great humiliation. Could it be that his pride and status could not compare to even a table?

“You, you, you…” His face was flushed, so furious that he wanted to commit murder.

“No money?” Ling Han smiled. “If you don’t have the money, I can only capture you, and force you to work hard every day as compensation.”

“Young Master Yuan, don’t be concerned about him,” Fan Luoling immediately said. “There is no way that he can compare to you. If you bother about him, it will only degrade your own status.”

“That’s right.” Yuan Tongguang nodded. That was right, how could he lower himself to come to blows with a country bumpkin?

“Let’s go!”

The three moved again, but this time, Ling Han did not just simply speak. He moved directly, and grabbed out at Yuan Tongguang’s neck.

“How dare you!” Yuan Tongguang and the others shouted furiously, and moved to strike out at Ling Han.

All three of them were Yin Souls, and Fan Luoling and Lin Yongchang were emperor tiers at that. Though Yuan Tongguang was a spoiled young master, he was also a king tier. Thus, the power of the combined efforts of all three was naturally extraordinary.

Any one of them would be able to easily suppress a mere Yang Soul.

Unfortunately, the person they met was Ling Han. Not only was he a monarch tier, he was a super monarch tier at that.

Peng!

Ling Han only sent out his Origin Power, and Regulations showed their might.?Peng, peng, peng,?both Fan Luoling and Lin Yongchang were sent flying, while Yuan Tongguang was held up by Ling Han by his neck.

In front of him, without battle prowess on the level of the peak stage of Heaven Soul, they were completely negligible.

“Looks like you have a problem with your hearing. I have already told you, pay compensation!” Ling Han patted Yuan Tongguang’s face. “For someone who has come out from the Ancient Alchemy Tower, it can’t be that you cannot even afford compensation for a single table, right?”

“Ling Han, you have gone too far!” Yuan Tongguang’s eyes spat fire. When had he ever been held up by someone by his neck, and had someone slap his face?

“You have learned absolutely nothing!” Ling Han shook his head.?Pa, pa, pa,?he delivered a series of slaps onto Yuan Tongguang’s face. Every slap caused Yuan Tongguang to cry out in pain.

Fan Luoling’s pretty face paled. She had never imagined that Ling Han would be so bold, and have such powerful strength. Under the combined efforts of the three of them, not only was he not defeated and fled, he had easily captured Yuan Tongguang instead.

This guy was rash in his actions, and was practically a brash idiot, but what if this brash idiot really killed Yuan Tongguang?

Though it was Ling Han who would have killed him, if it really came down to it, she would have to bear the blame as well. She would definitely get reprisal for it.

Thus, she was afraid now.

“Don’t be rash, don’t do anything foolish!” she screamed out shrilly.

Meanwhile, Lin Yongchang’s expression was cold, and he demanded, “Let him go!” Though Ling Han’s strength had reached a level that he could easily crush him, he did not cower in the slightest.

That was because power was never the forte for alchemists. His strength lay in alchemy, so what did it matter if he had stronger or weaker power?

“And who are you?” Ling Han did not glance at Lin Yongchang, and only patted Yuan Tongguang’s face. “Is there a problem with your hearing or your brain? Do you not understand the words I am saying to you?”

“You dare behave insolently towards me. Let me tell you, you are dead!” Yuan Tongguang still threatened stubbornly.

Pa, Ling Han slapped him across the face again.

“Ah!” Yuan Tongguang cried out in pain. Though he was a king tier, his life had been too smooth all this while. He had never sustained any physical suffering, and he immediately could not hold up under these few slaps from Ling Han. “I’ll pay! I’ll pay!”

Meanwhile, Lin Yongchang’s eyes were spitting fire. Ling Han actually dared to ignore him. He glared harshly at Ling Han, and threatened, “If you still won’t let him go, you will have to bear the consequences.”

Pa, Ling Han slapped Yuan Tongguang again.

Yuan Tongguang was taken aback. Hadn’t he said that he was willing to pay? Why had he hit him again? ‘Can’t you be reasonable here?’ He felt very wronged, and asked, “Why did you hit me?”

“Oh, he threatened me, which made me unhappy,” Ling Han replied smilingly.

‘F*ck!’

Yuan Tongguang almost jumped up in fury, but because his neck was still held up by Ling Han, he could only suppress the fury with a flushed face.

“What do you want?” Lin Yongchang asked darkly.

Pa, Ling Han delivered another slap onto Yuan Tongguang’s face.

Yuan Tongguang looked at Ling Han gloomily. Could it be that this slap was again because of Lin Yongchang?

“You’ve guessed correctly,” Ling Han said, and gave Yuan Tongguang an expression of approval.

Yet Yuan Tongguang could not feel the slightest bit of happiness. Seeing that Lin Yongchang was again about to speak, he first hurriedly blurted out, “Brother Lin, don’t speak again!” He would definitely sustain another slap if he actually said something again.

Pa, but he had not even finished this thought when another slap landed on his face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

And what was the reason for this now?

He looked at Ling Han plaintively.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “I got used to slapping, and did not manage to stop in time. It’s fine. The next time he threatens me, I’ll just slap you one time less.”

The only thought in Yuan Tongguang’s mind now was escape. At least for the moment, he did not dare to have any thought of revenge. He hurriedly said, “I am willing to pay, I will pay compensation!”

“That’s more like it.” Ling Han nodded. “To be fair, just give me 100,000,000 Star Stones.”

‘Why don’t you just go rob someone!’

Yuan Tongguang wanted to jump again and stomp, but he could not move at all. He could only pant loudly. “It’s too much. I can’t afford it!” Did Ling Han really take him for a fool?

“Ah, haven’t you come from the Ancient Alchemy Tower?” Ling Han shook his head. Even an idiot like Fu Yue had talked all by himself, offering him a ransom amount of 100,000,000 Star Stones. Why was this guy so poor?

Yuan Tongguang thought that he had taken a long distance trip, so how could he possibly bring so many Star Stones with him? However, the amount of 100,000,000 Star Stones was really too huge. Even in Ancient Alchemy Tower, it was still incredibly hard for him to collect 100,000,000 Star Stones.

…He was not the only person in the Yuan Clan. Moreover, he was not the most outstanding descendant of the Yuan Clan, either, so there was a limit to the wealth that he could allocate.

“Poor guy, just how much can you give?” Ling Han asked, his expression vicious, making him look extremely fierce.

This guy was the one who had delivered himself to his doorstep. How could he not blackmail him for a huge sum? There was completely no need to be reserved.

“10,000,000,” Yuan Tongguang said shakily.

“En?” Ling Han tossed a glare at him.

“20,000,000!” Yuan Tongguang hurriedly added onto the offer.

After a bout of bargaining, the deal was finally settled with 37,000,000 Star Stone—and a portion of that had been borrowed from Fan Luoling and Lin Yongchang.

“Fine then, you can go now.” Ling Han took the spatial ring, and withdrew his hand.

Yuan Tongguang hurriedly broke into a run, trying to get as far away from Ling Han as possible. He had no wish to have Ling Han hold him up by the neck again.

Meanwhile, Lin Yongchang’s eyes were fixed on Ling Han, his eyes dark. Just now, he had not spoken at all for Yuan Tongguang’s sake, but now he had no further interest to speak. This kind of guy who did not know what was good for him… would die a very horrible death!
