Chapter 908: Obvious Progress

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han made a huge meal for the fat cat and himself. Naturally, Gold-seeking Rat joined them and ate to its heart’s content.

Looking at the cat and rat being together like partners in crime, Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh—this was way too harmonious 1 .

This thought had yet to pass when the fat cat pounced onto Gold-seeking Rat—this little mouse actually dared to sneak a look at its meat! This scared the latter so badly that its four limbs became stiff, while its tail went straight as a ramrod. It then lay on the ground, playing dead.

This trick was time-tested. It used to amuse the ladies the likes of Zhu Xuan Er and Helian Xun Xue—only Hu Niu would drool looking at itself, causing the little one to feel extremely insecure. Fortunately, that girl who was a more gluttonous disaster than itself had already left them.

However, its happiness had barely lasted a few days when another ferocious fellow came along again!

‘Why did Master always have these scary monsters that would frighten this little one by his side?’

Ling Han couldn’t help bursting into laughter, but then the sound of pa, pa, pa was heard from the courtyard door. He went over to open the door, and saw Li Weiwei standing in the doorway with her hands on her waist, bearing an expression as if she was going to gobble someone up.

“Stupid blockhead, where have you been the past seven days? Do you know that I have been coming here to look for you every day until my legs have become sore? You are just my follower, yet you dare to make me run around looking for you, not to mention making a few wasted trips... Are you trying to rebel?”

She rattled on with her complaint, showing the bossy nature of the crafty and unruly young mistress that she was.

Ling Han quickly raised his hands in surrender and smiled. “My sincere apologies, something had cropped up a few days ago. Aren’t I back now? Right, you are so excited, has the sales channel for the ingredients been opened?”

“Obviously. With me paving the way, what problems could there be?” Li Weiwei harrumphed. “All the ingredients you gave me already sold out. However, because it was merely for them to try, we didn’t earn even a single True Origin Stone.”

Ling Han nodded. Had it not been for Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er, ordinary people wouldn’t have been able to send food into the households of influential officials. However, since they had eaten the food, it would now be his turn to have the final say.

He took out a lot of food and passed it to Li Weiwei, who was getting very excited. Soon, there would be True Origin Stones recorded in their accounts. Although this amount wasn’t much, she had earned it by her own hands, which made her feel exhilarated beyond measure.

Ling Han nevertheless shook his head—such a business couldn’t be maintained too long.

There was no other way. How could he explain the origin of these ingredients?

The capacity of a spatial Spirit Tool was limited. If he were able to endlessly supply these foods, he would certainly be suspected. After all, these foods were extremely delicious; it would be difficult to guarantee that no one would be curious.

Although Li Weiwei’s identity was very noble, Ling Han was just a fallen emperor. To be honest, had he not still retained this identity, which cultivator of Mountain River Tier would have held him in high regard?

So what if you were bullied, insulted, or even killed!

This was just quick money. Its purpose was to accumulate True Origin Stones while refining the Replenishing Spirit Pill without a hitch—this was the correct path to make a fortune. Otherwise, there was no way that one would be able to catch up with the earnings from the sale of Replenishing Spirit Pills from a single furnace even if one was to press on with the food business for a whole month.

After sending Li Weiwei off, Ling Han began to concoct alchemical pills, but this time it wasn’t done within Black Tower, but within the courtyard itself.

The big fat cat, having eaten and drunk its fill, was lying on its stomach on the wall of the courtyard, bored. But, with it there, likely no one would dare to come and disturb Ling Han. They ought to know that this white cat was raised by the Head of Scarlet Heaven Academy, an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier—would they dare to provoke him?

Concocting pills outside of the Black Tower was slightly more difficult. After all, the control of the fire’s temperature was no longer as he pleased, but Ling Han still made progress— pa, pa , two sounds rang out when he opened the furnace’s lid. This time, only three alchemical pills burst to pieces.

Two alchemical pills were concocted successfully.

One shouldn’t look at it as merely getting just one more pill—this was actually a great improvement. If it was any other alchemist, it might take them months or even years to obtain such results. But, Ling Han was the Alchemy Emperor, and Level Ten alchemical pill was still within his ability, so such progress was not at all unusual.

However, there was still no tribulation brought about by the concoction of alchemical pill.

‘Could it be that the level here is so high that even a Level Ten alchemical pill wouldn’t trigger a tribulation?’ Ling Han guessed. He couldn’t think of another possibility.

‘If there is no pill concoction-triggered tribulation, then so be it. Let’s do this again.’

In his ninth attempt, he harvested three alchemical pills from the furnace, while on the tenth attempt, he harvested four.

He ran out of ingredients at that point.

‘If I could refine one more furnace’s portion, then perhaps I could achieve perfection,’ Ling Han thought to himself.

He had already harvested ten Replenishing Spirit Pills; even if he could only exchange seven pills for one True Origin Stone, he had already earned back his investment. The other True Origin Stone had been used to purchase more seeds.

“Hehe, alchemy is still the most profitable business—I had chosen the right profession!”

Ling Han smiled as he went out. He intended to sell the seven pills and buy ingredients. This time, he actually spent another three days, so engrossed in alchemy that he didn’t even have time to cultivate any techniques.

‘The lack of manpower really makes me feel that time is not enough!’

Ling Han sighed. Now that he had to start from scratch with alchemy and martial arts, it would seem that he had to also make a choice, and choose the main area to focus on. If he were to try to manage both, he really wouldn’t be able to handle it. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I’ll walk the road of martial arts!” Ling Han quickly made up his mind. No matter how glorious alchemy was, it would merely act to serve martial arts. The respect that alchemists had received was also accorded to them by cultivators.

If an elite cultivator had no respect for you, could you manage to beat him up?

Therefore, at the end of the day, making one’s own strength as powerful as possible was truly the path to dominance.

He went to the big pharmacy from previously, and offered the seven Replenishing Spirit Pills for sale. The shop assistant didn’t know that it was Ling Han’s first time refining, and merely thought that he was a veteran. He could not help but shake his head. ‘Small-time alchemists like you should find some backing. Although a share of your earnings would be taken, there is also protection. It’s unlike now—if there is even a slight mistake, you can’t even get back your cost.’

The shop assistant kindly advised Ling Han then. After all, alchemists were a rare breed, and an alchemist who could concoct the Replenishing Spirit Pill was also not that simple.

Ling Han just smiled, and allowed the other party to give him ten more portions of ingredients, which he kept in the Black Tower and left.

“Oh?” As Ling Han walked out of the pharmacy, Luo Lie just came from around the corner. He stared at Ling Han’s back, and could not help but feel odd. He thought that Ling Han was merely a lowlife from a small world—what was he doing here?

He walked into the pharmacy, called over the shop assistant who had previously served Ling Han, and asked, “That person earlier, what did he come here for?”

The shop assistant, being aware that this was the young master of the Luo Clan, didn’t dare to not answer. Besides, this wasn’t anything shameful. “The customer sold seven Replenishing Spirit Pilsl, and in addition—”

“What!?” Luo Lie immediately interrupted the other party’s words, his eyes shining, and said, “Are you sure?”

The shop assistant nodded—could he even make a mistake about this?

Luo Lie immediately smirked—the academy strictly prohibited its students to sell the alchemical pills they were granted as well as techniques, martial arts, and the likes. Hahaha, he had been cracking his head as he was unable to find any weakness of Ling Han, but had not expected the other party to present one himself.

It was just that... how did the other party obtain seven Replenishing Spirit Pills?

This thought merely flashed across Luo Lie’s mind for a moment, and he immediately discarded it. As long as Ling Han had sold the alchemical pills bestowed to him by the Academy, then it would be a serious offence!

He was so excited that he didn’t even bother to buy any medicine. He turned around and directly returned home.

The irony of it was that if he had queried the clerk more, he would be able to deduce that those Replenishing Spirit Pills were concocted by Ling Han. Of course, he might still obstinately persist in going about things the wrong way, and firmly refuse to believe the possibility that a young cultivator from a small world could actually practice both alchemy and martial arts.
