Chapter 3416: The second heaven and earth upheaval begins

Translator: Henyee Translations I Editor: Henyee Translations

However, the matter of Princess Bixiao staying an entire night in Ling Han’s home spread like wildfire the next day, quickly spreading throughout the entire Imperial Capital.

Who was the most popular person in the Imperial Capital now?

It wasn’t Hong Tianbu, nor was it Ling Han, but rather this princess of the Demon Race!

As long as their sexual orientation was normal, any man would have designs on her. This flower had not fallen into anyone else’s hands yet, which meant that everyone would have a chance, even if this chance was incredibly slim. But now, Princess Bixiao had actually spent the night at Ling Han’s place. F***, this caused all the men to view Ling Han as a public enemy.

Ordinary people would only say a few words in anger, but for those like the Seventh Imperial Prince, killing intent rose up in them.

In their eyes, no matter how high Ling Han’s achievements were, he would only be a dog of the Chen Clan. Now, this dog actually ignored their warnings and wanted to compete with them over a woman. How could they not be furious?

If it was not for the fact that Ling Han still had the title of being a dual Grandmaster on his head, he would probably have been imprisoned in Heaven Prison by now, framed with some random crime, and killed arbitrarily. -Others would not dare to act so recklessly, but it was clear that these Imperial Princes would. The only one who could restrain them was Chen Fengyan, but Chen Fengyan would go into seclusion at the drop of a hat, which gave them the courage to act recklessly.

However, Ling Han had only slept with Princess Bixiao. This could not be considered a crime. No Imperial Prince could possibly mobilize an army just because of this, and kill him in broad daylight.

In terms of assassination, Ling Han’s own battle prowess was enough to sweep aside Inscription Tier elites, and added with a formation like Absolute Fairness, how many people would be able to suppress it?

Thus, those Imperial Princes were obviously filled with extreme hatred, but for the moment, they felt helpless and begrudging towards Ling Han.

Right at this moment, several earthquakes happened in quick succession in the Imperial Capital. Though they did not cause too many casualties, they caused a complete loss of communication.

Seven days later, news came back from various places.

As it turned out, it wasn’t just the Imperial Capital that experienced an earthquake, but the entire Celestial Sea Planet. Violent changes were taking place in the heaven and earth. After the earthquake, even more ancient sites saw the light of day, as well as Treasured Fruits. There were some ordinary people that accidentally ingested one, and actually rushed all the way to Inscription Tier, which was incredibly shocking.

There was also one person who had been herding goats. One of the ordinary goats ate a stalk of grass of a strange colour, and underwent a drastic change. Its size expanded by a whole ten times, and its originally white fur had also turned golden in colour. It had gained intelligence, and directly left with a battle cry.

It was said that this goat had become an Extreme Bone Tier existence. In these few days, elites continued to appear among humans and beasts overnight. It was almost as if the overall level of cultivation of elites had been completely disrupted.

The heaven and earth changed drastically, and the second great change had finally begun.

At this moment, everyone was both excited and terrified.

This was a massive opportunity. For example, the reason why the Four Great Generals and Grand Tutor Hong were able to become Inscription Tier elites high and noble, was because they had grasped the opportunity when heaven and earth changed drastically the first time, seizing the opportunity. It was because of this that they had been able to reign supreme for over a hundred years.

Now that the second upheaval had begun, as long as one could seize the opportunity, he similarly had the chance to become an existence like the Four Great Generals. In fact, the upheaval this time was even fiercer, and it was possible that he would soar even higher.

An Enlightenment Tier elite? A Mystery Realm Tier?

It was all possible.

However, great opportunities were also accompanied by danger. After the drastic change of heaven and earth, this itself was very dangerous. It was possible that even an unremarkable blade of grass could release a terrifying Sword Qi that could kill everything.

What was more dangerous was naturally the competition between humans and Demonic Beasts. Who didn’t want to seize the opportunity to rise up?

There was nothing much to be particular about in the competition within ancient sites. Everything was based on pure strength.

Xuanyuan Dingguo came to look for Ling Han and invited him to go with him on a trip. However, Ling Han refused.

It wasn’t that he looked down on Xuanyuan Dingguo, and thought that Xuanyuan Dingguo would be a burden, but rather that he was afraid of implicating Xuanyuan Dingguo.

Because of Princess Bixiao, Ling Han was like a street rat. Out of 100 men, 99 would probably want to kill him. Thus, if he went with Xuanyuan Dingguo, he would only be harming him.

And if Ling Han acted alone, it would be more convenient for him to come and go. After all, he did not want Xuanyuan Dingguo to know the secret of the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

Bringing the seven Calabash Brothers with him, Ling Han quietly left the Imperial City.

The current optical computer could only be used as a standalone computer. The network had long since been cut off. Ling Han sighed, and stored the optical computer into the gourd. Without communication functions, the practical value of the optical computer was greatly reduced.

A day later, he entered into a small town to gather some information. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If he had stayed in the Imperial Capital, he was actually like a blind and deaf man. Any news would take at least a few days to reach the Imperial Capital. Now that the upheaval of heaven and earth had become the largest topic of conversation, Ling Han soon found out a lot of useful information.

About two days’ journey from the Imperial Capital, an underground palace had appeared. It was said that the moment it appeared, it illuminated the heavens and celestial music wafted. Images of Celestials appeared.

Ling Han decided to take a look.

He used Floating Wind and Clouds, and his speed soared to four times the speed of sound, which was extraordinarily fast.

The travel time of these so-called two days were calculated according to the pace of Blood Transformation Tier, and Ling Han’s speed had increased fourfold. That would only take half a day for him. However, he could not continuously use Floating Wind and Clouds, and after an hour, his whole body was burning hot, and he could not bear it any longer.

However, at three times the speed of sound, Ling Han only spent half a day to reach his destination.

This was originally a large lake, but now the lake water had completely evaporated, and an ancient building appeared beneath it.

There was a kind of indescribable charm to the jade-like pavilion, and there was also a white-colored gas rising above the entire building, as if it was Celestial Qi.

“Yi, this is high-level energy,” Second Baby said. “It can actually block my eye technique.”

Ling Han was astonished. Even Second Baby’s eye technique couldn’t see through the white mist?

“Come, let’s go and take a look.”

The eight people and one pig walked towards the lake, but they immediately discovered that they could not climb over the wall. There was a powerful force suppressing them.

Sixth Baby could pass through the wall, but she couldn’t bring the Essence Nurturing Gourd inside, so they could only look for the real entrance.

After a small circle, they appeared at the main doors.

The door was already open. It was unknown whether it had never been closed, or if it had just been opened.

Ling Han looked around, and there was no one else in the surroundings. He strode in.

After entering through the main doors, Ling Han suddenly felt as if he had entered into a different world.

“Yi, the power of heaven and earth here is much denser,” Second Baby said. “There are formations here, and this place is cut off from the rest of the world, so it still maintains its appearance from a thousand years ago.” Third Baby said coldly and aloofly, “At that time, Celestial Sea Planet, was still suited to cultivation, so the power of heaven and earth would definitely be much denser.”

Ling Han looked at the kids, and said, “Do you guys know what happened to Celestial Sea Planet all those years ago?”

“Not very sure, but I seem to sense that a great calamity has happened. At first, a great many people would take care of us every day, but then they disappeared,” Eldest Baby said, biting his finger.

This confirmed Ling Han’s conjecture. At the time, there was great chaos on Celestial Sea Planet, and a great many people fled.

However, just what kind of calamity was this?

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Let’s go find Treasured Fruits!”
