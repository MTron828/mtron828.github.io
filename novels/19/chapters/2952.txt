2953 Crimson Great Herb?

Thus, instead of wasting time, it would be better to stop the battle and digest the experience gained in it.

Thank you readers!

Under the massive pressure of a powerful enemy like Xin Qihu, Ling Han actually created another seventh-grade seal, making him feel like he had to thank Xin Qihu.

‘The best way to thank you is to beat you till you burst!’ Ling Han thought to himself. He came out of seclusion, and continued to search for veins of raw stone.

He crossed numerous mountains and ocean trenches with unknown depths that had dried up, exploring mines everywhere.

However, as more and more people entered into this dimension, the competition became more and more intense, and his gains also became lesser and lesser.

!!

Several years later, Ling Han finally found a vein of ore.

“I’ve finally found one.”

Ling Han rubbed his hands together, slightly excited. He had not made any discoveries for tens of thousands of years.

He measured this vein of ore vein, yet he frowned because he had discovered an unknown object in the depths of the ore vein.

It was so-called unknown not because he did not recognize what this thing was, but rather because he could not see it at all.

It was a very large object that was wrapped in some powerful energy that blocked his divine sense.

He was very surprised. What was this thing that even his divine sense could not penetrate? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He’d dig it out for a look.

Ling Han dug with all his might. Heavenly Venerable Stone was not a hard material, and he soon dug to the depths of the vein of ore. Suddenly, a terrifying pressure assaulted him, making it difficult for him to take another step forward.

He couldn’t help but feel astonished. He had the battle prowess of the Sixth Tier, yet he was actually no match for this aura?

Could it be that there was something on the level of Seventh Tier inside?

Was it a crimson Great Herb?

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel longing. The crimson-colored Great Herb had always been the stuff of legends, but there was a pattern among Great Herbs that allowed a great elite to deduce the existence of this Great Herb.

The orange-colored Great Herb could help Fourth Tier elites advance one step further, reaching the Fifth Tier, and the crimson-colored Great Her could help Fifth Tier elites advance to the Sixth Tier. Of course, this would only increase their chances of successfully breaking through by a tiny bit.

What Ling Han needed the most now was time. He believed that he could advance to the Fifth Tier or Sixth Tier without relying on external power, but if he had the help of a Great Herb, it would undoubtedly shrink this time by countless folds.

Come on, come on.

He dug a few more feet, yet discovered that the pressure was getting greater and greater, causing him to feel as if he had become an ordinary person that was trapped in a swamp filled with mud, experiencing great strain.

He continued onwards with all his might, and finally a crimson color appeared ahead of him.

Ling Han was surprised. This Great Herb was a little too big, wasn’t it?

The Great Herbs that had been previously unearthed were only about a foot long, and it wouldn’t be much bigger than that, but this smear of crimson red was at least three feet long.

As expected of the top of all herbs?

Ling Han dug again, and after a few more hand chops, he couldn’t help but reveal an expression of shock.

This was the Great Herb?

What appeared in front of his eyes was actually a crimson dress.

It was naturally impossible for a dress alone to put so much pressure on him, but no matter how strong a Heavenly Venerate Tool was, there was a limit, and that was the Sixth Tier.

Seventh Tier…. only a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate could possess Seventh-Tier power. There was nothing that could equal that in existence.

Which also meant that there was a Seventh Tier elite buried here?

It couldn’t be, right? Hadn’t all the Seventh Tiers of the Genesis World of the last era appeared? Chong Ya and the others as well as the dead Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand totalled up to six.

Should he continue digging?

Ling Han hesitated slightly. There didn’t seem to be much meaning in digging out the corpse of another Seventh Tier.

His hesitation was only momentary, and he immediately began digging again.

He was a curious person. No matter what, he had to get to the bottom of this, right?

He carefully continued. The aura of the Seventh Tier continuously seeped out, causing his face to pale.

Though he possessed Sixth-Tier battle prowess, Seventh Tiers could crush any existence, and added with the fact that Ling Han only possessed Sixth-Tier battle prowess, but was not a real Sixth Tier, his physique was much too inferior.

At this moment, Ling Han genuinely felt like giving up.

But right at this moment, weng, that powerful pressure instantly spiked countless times over.

As the crimson shadows moved, a person suddenly sat up.

Se, se, se! Countless broken bits of rubble fell down, but Ling Han could not feel anything. He was just staring at the person in front of him.

This was a woman, breathtakingly beautiful and indescribably exquisite.

The beauty of the Empress and Hu Niu should not be inferior to hers, but this woman possessed an indescribable bearing, making her seem more ethereal and serene.

This woman’s eyes had initially been closed, but now they were suddenly open. Instantly, she looked lively, which also gave rise to an astonishing pressure centered on her. Even Ling Han was breaking out in a cold sweat.

Seventh Tier, this was definitely a supreme being of Seventh Tier.

Why was there another Seventh Tier?

If there had still been a living Seventh Tier, Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan and the others would definitely have said so, and would have gone to search for her. Moreover, the person who had restrained Extermination in the past was only Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand, and there was no other person.

Thus, it was strange. How had this Seventh Tier come out?

Ling Han’s first reaction was to flee, but he immediately discovered that though this woman’s eyes were astonishingly beautiful, as deep as the sea, they were also filled with blankness and innocence. This kind of gaze could only be seen on infants.

A dignified Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate was actually a newborn infant?

‘How was this possible?!’

Heavenly Venerates were despised by the heaven and earth. There was absolutely no way that the heaven and earth would nurture a Seventh Tier.

Could it be that there was something like an upgraded version of the Dimension Scroll, which directly created a Seventh Tier? Impossible, absolutely impossible. Hysteria was a dimension, a transcendent dimension at that. Even it couldn’t create a Seventh Tier, so how could other dimensions do it?

“Hello.” Ling Han broke into a smile, trying his best to appear gentle and amiable.

The red-clothed woman slanted her head slightly, and stared at Ling Han. “H-hello…”

Her words were unclear, and it was as if she were just learning how to speak.

Could it be that when the Genesis World had collapsed all those years ago, her spirit had suffered a powerful impact, and that was why she had become like this?

This was not impossible.

A Seventh Tier being indestructible was referring to their physical bodies, which were tempered by the six fundamental particles, but divine sense couldn’t reach this level. For example, the impact caused by the destruction of the Genesis World could shatter it.

Heavenly Venerate Yellow Sand was clear proof of this. His physical body was unscathed, but his spirit was dead.

Hence, if this female supreme being’s divine sense had been severely damaged at that time, it would not have been strange for her to have turned into an infant. However, after a Heavenly Venerate developed intelligence, they would be able to grow at an incomparably shocking rate, what more when it was a Seventh Tier.

“What’s your name?” Ling Han questioned further.

“What, is, your, name?” This female supreme being echoed his words. Though she was stuttering, it was clear that her words were much clearer than before.

‘Fine, I’ve asked for nothing.’

Ling Han sighed. Was he going to have to teach a child how to speak?

He didn’t dare to let the Empress and Hu Niu out. This female supreme being didn’t know how to suppress her aura at all, and even Ling Han felt immense pressure, as if his skin was about to tear. The Empress and Hu Niu were far inferior to himself, and faced with this aura, they would definitely be crushed.

‘I’ll teach her then.’

Ling Han taught this female supreme being how to speak. It had to be said that he was still secretly a little proud. She was a Seventh Tier, and he could already become a teacher for a Seventh Tier.
