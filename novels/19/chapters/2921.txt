2922 Betrayed?

The terror of dimensions lay in their size.

When a dimension crashed down, it was enough to impede tens of thousands of Heavenly Venerates of the same level at the same time. If that was not the case, what would qualify Ling Han to kill the enemy leader in the midst of an army of 10,000 on his own?

To say nothing of him, even Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu couldn’t do it.

‘I only have 13 dimensions. What if I can have 130 dimensions, 1300 dimensions?’ Ling Han thought to himself. He couldn’t help but be captivated and aspire for this future.

!!

At that time, even if he fell into a siege of Hysteria’s army, there would be no need for him to enter into the Void. He only had to release one dimensional projection after another, and he would be able to suppress these monsters to the point that they could only sprawl out in submission.

Even the projections were like this, so what about the dimension itself?

Just how many times would its might increase?

This could not be easily attempted, because if the projection had exploded, so be it. It could be used again after a few months or years. However, the dimension was different. This was the foundation. If the foundation was completely gone, how could there be a second time?

‘Thus, this is my trump card. Unless absolutely necessary, I will definitely not use it,’ Ling Han thought. ‘On the other hand, I still have to improve my cultivation level as soon as possible, and increase my capacity to accommodate dimensions.’

He was just about to tear a rip into the Void and return when a feeling of extreme unease suddenly rose up in him.

Shua! In the Void, a whip-like shadow whipped over.

It was Hysteria!

This was still not Hysteria’s main body, yet gave Ling Han an incredibly realistic feeling, oppressing him to the point that even breathing was difficult for him.

He suddenly had an instinctive feeling that this was Hysteria using the Power of Dimension to suppress him.

Ling Han could use the dimensional projections to suppress others, so why couldn’t Hysteria do the same?

Not only could it do it, it could even do it better than Ling Han. It could do it 100 times better, 1,000 times better than he could. The two sides were not even on the same level at all.

Though it looked like a whip-like shadow was whipping over, there was a dimensional projection within. It was equivalent to a transcendent dimension suppressing him. What kind of concept was that?

In the past, though Hysteria had also attacked Ling Han before, it actually had not had any killing intent. Its purpose had only been to awaken him.

However, this strike was completely different. It was intended to kill him.

It was clear that Hysteria didn’t have any intention to “save” Ling Han. Since he had already betrayed Hysteria, it wouldn’t hesitate to erase him.

The number one elite in the world had moved. Even if it was only a doppelganger, who could block it?

It would have to be a Sixth Tier, at least, right?

Ling Han did not hesitate in the slightest. Weng, weng, weng! The 13 dimensions in his body were all unleashed, forming a shield in front of him.

Even Fifth Tier elites would be affected by the dimensional projections. Now, however, not only were 13 dimensions appearing at the same time, but they were also dimensions proper. The might of these dimensions had increased by at least 10 times, and the shield that they formed was most likely impenetrable.

Peng, peng, peng! However, with Hysteria’s attack, the 13 dimensions instantly exploded into pieces. They were only able to stall it for a sliver of time.

This bought Ling Han an instant, and even made him throw up blood madly. The dimensions crumbled, and he, as the main body, was naturally implicated as well. However, he did not even pause, and used this instant to tear a rip into space and return to the Genesis World.

“Wa!” He began to spit out large mouthfuls of blood, and his face instantly became incredibly pale. His whole person was lying on the ground, and he did not want to move a single muscle.

The dimensions that he had painstakingly nurtured had been obliterated. This caused too much damage to him.

He cast his gaze internally. Thankfully, though the dimensions had been blown apart, there was still a sliver of residual power left behind. This could still allow him to slowly restore the dimensions, but everything would have to start from the beginning again. His hard work of the last 10,000,000 years was completely wasted.

“Damn it!”

Ling Han sat up in a cross-legged position, and drew out a Great Herb. This was a recovery type Great Herb. Crack! He took a bite, and tried his best to recover as soon as possible.

After a whole three years, he had finally recovered a little.

He stopped, and began to ponder.

‘How did Hysteria find me?

‘I’ve already erased the mark it left in my body. If it could still find me, why didn’t it appear after I have traveled through the Void so many times before?

‘This time has been so coincidental; this is practically an ambush set up for me in the Void?

‘Could it be that someone leaked my whereabouts?’

Ling Han was shocked. If that was not the case, how could there be such a coincidence?

But who had leaked the secret?

It should be known that there were over 100 undercover agents in the Flaming Frost Realm, so could it be one of them?

However, not many people knew that he was going to battle this time. Aside from the Empress and the other women, the Rain Emperor, the black donkey, and the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, no one else knew. Additionally, there were also his comrades: Bai Mifan, Fu Yuan, and Xuan Feng.

If there were any more, it would be Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang, the three commanders-in-chief. Whatever mission Ling Han and his group wanted to carry out on the battlefield, they would definitely have to make a report.

If there was an undercover agent, he would have to be among these people.

Ling Han immediately excluded the Empress, the black donkey, and the others. They had walked with him all the way here, and he had absolute trust in them.

Then that would be among these six people: Bai Mifan, Fu Yuan, Xuan Feng, Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and Wu Haoyang.

However, Lin Youlian and the other two greatest prodigies of all eternity were descendants of Seventh Tiers, so the possibility of them becoming Hysteria’s subordinates was close to zero. Of course, it was also possible that Xin Qihu collaborated with Hysteria just to get rid of Ling Han.

Thus, the most likely candidates were these three peopleXin Qihu, Fu Yuan, and Xuan Feng.

Ling Han did not want to doubt his own comrades. Hence, he was more inclined to believe that it was Xin Qihu who had leaked the secret.

‘For the sake of killing me, this person is really willing to do anything, even disregarding his bottom line?’ Ling Han thought. He continued to recover from his injuries, and after another few decades, he finally recovered. However, the dimensions that had been destroyed would need to be nurtured again and reformed. This was tens of millions of years of hard cultivation.

He returned to the Realm Battlefield, and had not even had the chance to talk about his own matters when he received an earth-shattering piece of newsa change had taken place in that group of lost primitive dimensions.

The Empress and the others had not left yet, and had been waiting for Ling Han to return.

“What happened?” Ling Han asked.

“We’re not sure, either, but it’s said to be extremely shocking.”

“Let’s take a look.”

...

Ling Han and the others set out. After merely over a dozen years, they had once again arrived at the group of lost primitive dimensions.

“There doesn’t seem to be any change.” Ling Han swept a glance over. This place was just like how it had been in the past; it was just that countless ruins and devastation had been left behind because veins of ore had been excavated.

Peng!

Just as he said this, a pillar of light rose up in the distance, breaking through the barrier between dimensions, and causing an explosion in the Void.

Ling Han was instantly shocked. “The energy in this pillar of light is too terrifying. It has reached the Sixth Tier, at least.”

Hu Niu cocked her head, and said, “Could it be that this is an energy storm that has rushed out of the ninth and 10th dimension?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Was this possible?

The Empress nodded. “At present, the ground layer here has been excavated, forming a great many passageways. It would not be strange for the energy storm to be able to go through and exit.”

Weng! A terrifying aura swept past, spreading out for millions and millions of kilometers.
