2765 Huai Jian has become a Heavenly Venerate

The Foreign Realm—a very familiar place.

In the past, compelled by the Heavenly Venerates of the two realms, Ling Han had had no choice but to take risks by fleeing here. He had also experienced a hot-blooded youth here that was filled with battle.

After more than an epoch, he had returned once more.

But this time, he was already a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and his true strength had probably reached the Third Tier. He could sweep aside all and any opposition here.

“Let’s go to the core of the dimension first.”

Compared with seeking out those elites of the Foreign Realm and taking revenge, Ling Han’s priority now was naturally to take hold of the core of the dimension first. When he claimed all the powers of dimension, who knew, Ling Han might be able to comprehend the profound secrets of how the Genesis World gave rise to dimensions, and from there become capable of producing power of dimension within his own body.

Because this was the Foreign Realm, they also took note of a matter that was widely spread as they traveled—Huai Jian was presently breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Huai Jian?

Ling Han was dazed for a moment before realization dawned on him. Huai Jian was the most outstanding prodigy of the Foreign Realm from an epoch ago. At the time, Ling Han could fight him to a stalemate. He had not thought that Huai Jian was about to become a Heavenly Venerate after an epoch.

Ling Han felt very rueful. The people that he knew all had extremely great improvement.

Of course, to say nothing of the fact that Huai Jian had not become a Heavenly Venerate, even if he had reached the limits of this dimension, Ling Han would have been able to suppress him single-handedly. While a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he was unbelievably powerful.

Not too many years later, they arrived at the location of the core here.

Originally, the core of a dimension could not be approached. This was the true power of heaven and earth. Once one approached it, they would be strongly rebounded by the power of this dimension. This might far surpassed Regulations.

However, Ling Han presently already possessed Third Tier’s strength, and this was the core of a low-level dimension, so compared with Ling Han… it was actually outmatched!

If Ling Han unleashed his full power, he could even burst this core of the dimension.

He naturally would not do that. Instead, he stretched out a hand, and stuck his hand directly into the core of the dimension, forcefully extracting the power of this dimension.

In other places, he would only be seated nearby, comprehending the power of the dimension, but now that the balance of strength was inclined towards him instead, there was no need to go to so much trouble. He could just simply extract it—it was simple and domineering.

The core of the dimension trembled, seemingly afraid that Ling Han would burst it, yet it did not dare to fight back at all.

Ling Han soon completed the process, and one of the cells inside his body condensed the power of this dimension. In the future, this process would repeat endlessly.

This was really overwhelmingly fast.

They left the core, and saw the entire Foreign Realm was in a state of excitement. The reason for this was very simple.

Huai Jian had successfully broken through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and the Foreign Realm had gained another supreme elite.

“Shall we go and take a look?” The women were all very curious. This was a prodigy that had been able to become their husband’s equal, and now he had also broken through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“Sure.” Ling Han nodded. He, too, wanted to know if the Foreign Realm had broken the agreement, and begun an invasion against the Celestial Realm again.

Because the news of Huai Jian breaking through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier caused a great commotion, it was very easy to investigate his whereabouts. Who would imagine that anyone would dare to make a move on Huai Jian?

“You all?” The person that they asked looked at Ling Han and his group, and then shook his head. “Young man, you guys wanting to admire an elite is understandable, but what cultivation level are you in? Are you guys even qualified to go?”

At present, Ling Han and company had disguised themselves as beings of the Foreign Realm, and with their strength, there was completely no worry that anyone would see through their disguises.

Ling Han naturally would not drop to his level, and merely responded with a smile.

When they had gotten their answers, Ling Han and company set out, heading towards the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords.

The Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords was where Huai Jian had gone into seclusion to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. In the past, it was not called the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords, but when Huai Jian was comprehending Dao, thousands and thousands of sword projections appeared on the mountain. When those who cultivated Sword Dao saw this, they experienced boundless enlightenment.

Hence, this mountain had also been renamed as Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords. From then onwards, it had also become a sacred land of the Foreign Realm.

At the foot of the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords, there was a sea of people.

Everyone was fighting to catch a glimpse of the newly promoted Heavenly Venerate. The latter was a living legend, and also the only person who had become a Heavenly Venerate in the latest epoch.

“Sigh, if there had not been a demon king that had barged in here in the past, perhaps it would not just have been Lord Huai Jian alone who would have broken through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier,” someone suddenly said ruefully.

“Lord Liu, what does that mean?” someone beside him asked.

The man from before shook his head. “In the past, there had been quite a number of prodigies that were Lord Huai Jian’s equal. Even if they were inferior, they were not too far off from him, either. But a spy from the Celestial Realm hid himself under the wings of Lord Desolate Eternity. When he was exposed, he actually killed those prodigies, and only Lord Huai Jian was spared.

“What!?” the people in the area all exclaimed. This was secret knowledge that they were unaware of.

Ling Han just happened to be nearby, and couldn’t help but feel startled for a moment. Wasn’t he the one that was being talked about now?

He had not thought that there would actually be people that would still remember him even after so many years.

The speaker merely smiled, and did not proceed to make explanations for what had happened in the past.

However, those people in the vicinity all began to curse Ling Han. Some said that he was underhanded, and there were some that said he was treacherous. The Foreign Realm had treated him so well, yet he had still not come to his senses.

Ling Han was unconcerned, but the women all looked furious.

Shui Yanyu was the first to move. Peng! A gust of power rippled out. Pa, pa, pa! Some of the people around instantly collapsed.

Though she was only a First Heaven Celestial King, and not a strong one at that, the people around her were only at the Ascending Origin Tier at best, so how could they possibly withstand her power?

This commotion was too great, and it immediately led to observation on an even greater scale. People were all confused. Why had a fight suddenly broken out here?

But everyone knew that with how strong Shui Yanyu was, she had to be a Tenth Lotus elite at the very least, so how many people would dare to interfere in her matters?

“Humph, this is the sacred land where Lord Huai Jian has attained Dao. Today, there are even a considerable number of Lord Heavenly Venerates that have come to offer congratulations. Who dares to be insolent here?” someone reprimanded. He was a red-haired man, and his right arm was the complete form of a scorpion’s pincer.

He had the confidence to reprimand her because he was a Thirteenth Lotus elite.

“It’s me, so what about it?” Shui Yanyu countered.

The red-haired man glanced a while longer at Shui Yanyu, humphed, and then said, “Kneel down immediately, and beg for forgiveness in the direction of the summit. I can spare you this once.” He could tell with a glance that Shui Yanyu’s cultivation level was only at the Tenth Lotus, and the gap between the two of them was boundless.

Shui Yanyu naturally would not agree. She scoffed, “If you kneel down and apologize to me, I will spare you just this once.”

“How dare you!!” When the red-haired man saw that Shui Yanyu actually dared to mimic him, he immediately shouted loudly. With a wave of his hand, he grabbed out at Shui Yanyu. The scorpion pincers grew exponentially in size, with iridescent light wrapped around it, exuding the great might of Regulations of the Great Dao.

A puny Tenth Lotus actually dared to talk back to him; she truly had to be tired of living.

Bewitching Maiden Rou gave a soft shout, and sent out a palm strike. Peng! The red-haired man was immediately sent flying, a mist of green-colored blood gushing out of him.

...

She was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Though it was impossible for her to further advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, her battle prowess naturally was not something that the red-haired man could match.

Peng, peng, peng, peng! The red-haired man was struck flying, and his body crashed into all the obstacles blocking his way, destroying a considerable number of mountain rocks before finally sinking into the mountain, no longer visible.

Everyone paled in shock, and then felt outraged.

This was the Mountain of Ten Thousand Swords, where Lord Huai Jian had attained Dao, and would be one of the sacred lands of the future, yet what was it now? Lord Huai Jian had not even officially established his own faction, and his mountain was already damaged—though it was not very serious.

This was a grave act of blasphemy.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
