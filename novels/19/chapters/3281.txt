Chapter 3282 - 3282: Recruitment from Various Parties

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han became famous after a single battle.

Indeed, he was also very famous previously. He had defeated Hu Yang twice, but there were factors that were not based on his abilities. Naturally, he could not convince the public that he had truly deserved the win.

But this time, it was completely different.

Ling Han had defeated Hu Yang head-on, without the slightest bit of doubt.

This world worshipped elites, and although Ling Han could not yet be called an elite, it was already clear that was the direction he was heading.

Quite a few people were analyzing Ling Han’s strength and studying how he could be so strong. However, from the perspective of strength, they could not come up with a reasonable explanation no matter how they thought about it, to explain how Ling Han could match Hu Yang.

In the end, everyone determined that Ling Han must have mastered a powerful martial arts technique to make up for the difference in power.

Because Ling Han had come from Huju City, and Huju City had already disappeared, many forces had the intention of recruiting him, offering all kinds of conditions.

Some used money, some used cultivation techniques and martial arts techniques to tempt him, and some directly gifted beauties. Naturally, none of them could move Ling Han.

He was not short of money and was not interested in beauties. As for cultivation techniques, how many people could offer him a cultivation technique that surpassed Brother Monkey Cultivation Technique?

He could take a look at the martial arts techniques and use them as a reference, but to sell himself in exchange?

‘Haha.’

Ling Han returned to his residence. He did not plan to meet anyone. Since he had advanced into the Blood Transformation Tier, he would need Blood

Transformation Tier medicinal pills and cultivation formations from now on. He also needed to prepare more Treasured Fruits to replenish hi Qi and blood, so that he would not have to stagnate after reaching the peak stage of First Change because he did not have any supplements.

That night, Ling Han was planning to concoct alchemical pills when he suddenly felt a sense of uneasiness.

He quickly turned around and saw a figure sitting in the shadows.

“Ga ga, brat, your senses are getting more and more sensitive!” The figure laughed.

Ling Han’s eyesight had also improved greatly, and his pupils quickly adapted

to the darkness. He could vaguely see that it was a short old geezer.

His pupils immediately constricted. This little old man was the one who had fed him poison!

“Brat, I’ve really underestimated you!” The little old man said with a smile. “In such a short period of time, you’ve already rushed up to the Blood

Transformation Tier, and you’ve even defeated that kid from the Hu Clan.”

Ling Han carefully observed this little old man, but he still gave him an unfathomable feeling. He was definitely an Extreme Bone Tier elite.

He believed that if he unleashed his full strength, he would be able to match the Extreme Bone Tier’s first level, but it would only be for a short ten minutes. Once the boiling of his blood and Qi ended, he would definitely be blasted into smithereens by an Extreme Bone Tier.

This little old man was definitely not at the first level of Extreme Bone Tier.

What about using a Weapon Nurturing Leaf?

Ling Han shook his head in his heart. Although he had three-patterned leaves, the third pattern had only just formed, and there was still a distance away from being completely matured. He would only be able to unleash the power of the first or second stage of Extreme Bone Tier, which would still not be able to threaten this old geezer.

“Brat, do you want to use the Weapon Nurturing Leaf to deal with me?” The little old man smiled.

This old man knew that he had the Weapon Nurturing Leaf?

As expected, this matter could not be hidden. It was just that the academy did not call him to account, which could be considered as admitting his strength and luck.

The question was, how did the little old man know?

What did he have to do with the academy?

Thoughts flashed in Ling Han’s mind, but a smile appeared on his face, and he said calmly, “Even if I use it, it’s impossible for me to hurt you, old man.”

“Haha, brat, you’re really becoming more and more likable,” the little old man said with a smile. He pointed at Ling Han, and said, “I spared your life back then because I saw that you still had some accomplishments in alchemy. I didn’t think that your talent in martial arts would be even more astonishing.”

He nodded. “It seems that my decision back then was very correct. You cultivate diligently, and I will fight to get you a mission. If you complete it well, you will slowly gain trust. In the future, you will have a chance to participate in promoting and establishing the power over this world!”

Ling Han sneered in his heart. Having used poison to control him, and he still wanted him to sell himself into slavery?

This was the capital. All the resources in the world were gathered here. As long as he had enough money, he would definitely be able to find the remaining medicinal ingredients and concoct the antidote for the Soul Departing Pill.

“Senior, can you give me your name?” he asked.

The little old man hesitated slightly before saying, “My surname is Cheng. As for what my name is, I’ve already forgotten.” He turned around and jumped out of the window, instantly disappearing into the moonlight.

Ling Han thought to himself that he also possessed two times the speed of sound. If he really wanted to shed all pretense of cordiality, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to escape from the hands of an Extreme Bone Tier. However, if he wanted to fight and win an opponent like that now, he was dreaming.

“However, once I reach the Third Change, or even the Second Change, I should have the qualifications to match the first stage of the Extreme Bone Tier.” Ling Han thought to himself.

The old geezer’s appearance alerted him, reminding him that there was a rope around his neck that could strangle him at any time.

This kind of feeling made Ling Han extremely displeased. Thus, his first step was to earn money, a lot of money, in order to buy the medicinal ingredients needed to concoct the antidote.

However, before he could start refining pills, someone else came.

This time, the visitor did not enter without informing him. Instead, Huan Xue informed him of the request for a meeting.

It was Butler Mu.

If it were anyone else, Ling Han wouldn’t be in the mood to meet them now, but if it was Butler Mu, he still had to give him face.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Ling Han, you’re really shocking!” Butler Mu had long since recovered from his injuries, and his face was full of emotion. “After defeating Hu Yang, those factions with some abilities have probably heard of your name.”

Ling Han sighed in his heart. Of course, hadn’t that old geezer with the surname Cheng already come?

He smiled and said, “Is Miss Feng alright now?”

“Young Miss is doing very well now.” Butler Mu smiled like a kind father, full of comfort.

Ling Han shook his head inwardly as he watched. This Butler Mu was really completely enraptured, treating Feng Ruoxian like his own daughter. Forget it, this was someone else’s choice, as long as you were happy.

“Although His Majesty, the Holy Emperor, hasn’t come out of seclusion yet, as the representative of Huju City, Young Miss has an extraordinary significance. She will definitely be favored by the Holy Emperor in the future.” Butler Mu continued, but his expression suddenly darkened. “Young Miss has been getting very close to the princes.”

In his opinion, Feng Ruoxian shouldn’t have to marry into the royal family. Although she could obtain a great status, it was impossible for her to obtain happiness.

Furthermore, the royal family was fighting for the throne. Once the Holy Emperor passed away in the future, no matter which prince took the throne, there would definitely be a huge reckoning. Hence, it was better to marry into an ordinary family. Although it was ordinary, it was also safe.

Ling Han didn’t interrupt. He didn’t have much of a relationship with Feng Ruoxian to begin with, so whatever decision she made was her business. “This time, I came—” Butler Mu hesitated and paused for a moment before saying, “Young Miss has just arrived in the capital and is unfamiliar with the place. She doesn’t have anyone that she can really use, so I want to ask you to help her more.”

Ling Han was astounded. Help?

To put it nicely, wasn’t it just to take him in as a servant?

With Ling Han’s current reputation, if Feng Ruoxian could take him in as a servant, then her status in the imperial capital would greatly increase.

However, where did Feng Ruoxian’s confidence come from? She actually wanted him to be her servant?

‘You’re too thick-skinned, aren’t you? Do I owe you anything?’
