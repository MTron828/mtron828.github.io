Chapter 2369: True selves arrive, great clash of Heavenly Venerates Translations

Everyone was enchanted. Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was too dominant, facing two great Heavenly Venerates all by himself. He was clearly already heavily injured, yet was not afraid in the slightest, and looked down loftily on the rest of the world. And if he was in his prime condition, just how noble and majestic would he be?

Ling Han could imagine it. When Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had battled with the Foreign Realm Heavenly Venerates, he had also been alone, and he had just charged onwards like that, turning even eternity into a void, and destroying the Foreign Realm’s dreams of invasion for several epochs.

This would cause one’s blood to blaze, dream about this, and be filled with admiration.

Unfortunately, Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the other great Heavenly Venerates had clearly deliberately concealed this part. The future generations had not even heard of a person like the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le, and that was the same for even Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable.

If it were not for the fact that there were some old Celestial Kings that had been alive since that era, Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s sacrifice would probably have long since been buried in history.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s expression darkened. “Friend Wu Le, your time is already limited. Even if you can save this brat once, how could it be that you could save him 10 times, 100 times, or 1000 times?”

Heavenly Venerate Wu Le scoffed. “As long as I am still alive, I will not allow anyone to touch a single hair on his head!”

Both Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate did not speak further, and merely looked on coldly, as if capable of freezing even time and space. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could feel their bodies trembling as a boundless chill spread out.

It should be known that this was only the divine sense of two Heavenly Venerates. If their true selves were here, just how terrifying would it be?

Heavenly Venerable Tier was too powerful!

More and more Celestial Kings were arriving. Next, it was not just Celestial Kings. Even a considerable number of Ascending Origin Tiers and Immortal Palace Tiers had arrived. The majority were the most talented of the younger generation, such as Ji Wuming, Shi Chanzi, Hong Huang, Jia Lan, the Rain Emperor, and so on.

When they saw Ling Han, their eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

How was this possible?

Wasn’t this guy being hunted by the Heavenly Venerates? It was said that he had fled into the Foreign Realm, but after roaming around there, not only had he returned completely unscathed, he was accompanied by another Heavenly Venerate.

Just what kind of great luck was this!

Ling Han swept a glance over. His eyes first paused on the Rain Emperor, and he smiled slightly at this second brother of his before shifting over, and pausing on Hong Huang.

He was stunned. This guy actually hadn’t died?

A dead person could still be revived. This was his first time encountering something like this.

It had to be the power of a Heavenly Venerate. How truly shocking that they were capable of even reviving a dead man. This was truly heaven-defying.

However, at this moment, whether it was Ling Han, Ji Wuming, or Hong Huang, none of them were in any place to speak. The three great Heavenly Venerates were the true main characters here, and they were also the only leading characters.

More and more people arrived, but after a while, space ripped, and two people walked out at practically the same moment.

Xiu, xiu.?The two slivers of divine sense of the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable immediately shot towards these two people, and sank into them in a flash.

These two people… were the true selves of the two great Heavenly Venerates!

Their true selves had arrived, and this might naturally could not be spoken about in the same breath. They did not need to move, and even the heaven was trembling and the ground was cracking as clouds swirled quickly. A boundless heavenly tribulation was already forming, turning into an ocean of lightning giants that blasted out at these two great Heavenly Venerates.

“Hand him over or die!” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable demanded coldly. He was clearly only as tall as the average person, but as everyone looked at him, it was like they were looking up at a god that was millions and millions of meters tall, and their only option was to kneel in worship.

“You’re dreaming!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le scoffed. If he had wanted to hand Ling Han over, he would have done so long ago, and the reason why he had not fled earlier was because, firstly, this was the pride of a Heavenly Venerate, and secondly, he knew that wherever he fled, he would be caught up with ultimately by the two of them, so he might as well battle them here and now.

Battle until these two people hurt, and naturally they would no longer dare to say anything else.

“Then we will send you off to the underworld!” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate spoke, his voice overbearing and filled with the authority of an emperor. Instantly, the majority of people were compelled to kneel, feeling like even their hearts were close to exploding.

Only the minority, a few Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, were exempted. Those were the Celestial Kings of the highest tier.

“Jiuwu, you really think you are the highest authority now?” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed coldly, and actually made the first move. With him sending out a palm strike, it turned to a millstone that shrouded the heavens and sun, and descended on Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate.

An ancient seal appeared on this millstone, surpassing the height of Regulations, as if it was unveiling the true essence of the heaven and earth.

Those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings instantly widened their eyes and looked on carefully. This was a Heavenly Venerate using himself as an example. If they could grasp some ideas from this, who knew, they might be able to open the great doors that led to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Heavenly Venerable Tier had surpassed Regulations, but this did not mean that he could not use Regulations. This was Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s own Dao.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was naturally unafraid, charging forwards with his fists.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two great Heavenly Venerates fought. This was too terrifying. The heaven and earth was forcefully ripped apart, as if doomsday was about to arrive.

And as they fought, the heavenly tribulation naturally became even more terrifying. Heavenly Venerates were elites that could truly damage this heaven and earth, and the moment they appeared, they would be targeted by the heaven and earth, and if they battled, they would sustain an even stronger backlash from the heaven and earth.

But now, neither of the two great Heavenly Venerates paid any regard to this. They were only battling with their full efforts.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable set his eyes on Ling Han. It was only a stare, yet Ling Han felt as if his skin was about to explode.

“Small Tower!” Ling Han said softly, and a strong power instantly bubbled out of his body, the aura of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier spreading out.

…Now that he had returned to the Celestial Realm, the Black Tower naturally could extract the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm, and was completely revived. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, the Black Tower had not completely recovered. Thus, it could only help Ling Han reach the height of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier now. Otherwise, it could’ve boosted him to a higher level.

However, this was more than enough to deal with the pressure exerted by the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. After all, there was no need for him to clash with a direct attack from a Heavenly Venerate.

“Humph!” Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable moved, stretching out a hand. Instantly, it arrived in front of Ling Han’s eyes. It was as large as a star, planning to squeeze Ling Han to bursting.

“Sealed Emotion, what is the point of bullying a child?” Heavenly Venerable Wu Le suddenly charged back, his fist flying towards Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable’s face.

Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable knew that Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was already close to the end of his line, but this was still the attack of a Heavenly Venerate, after all. How could he possibly dare to be careless? He had no choice but to give up his attack on Ling Han, and turn around to parry the attack from Heavenly Venerate Wu Le.

“Hahahaha!” Heavenly Venerate Wu Le laughed loudly, his lofty aspirations soaring. He alone was clashing with two great Heavenly Venerates, and still managed to attack with every move, making it seem as if he alone could match two great Heavenly Venerates.

Everyone was exclaiming repeatedly in shock. They had not thought that this newly appeared Heavenly Venerate would actually be so impressive.

Sealed Emotion and Jiuwu had their own considerations. It was not that they were no match to Wu Le. On the contrary, the latter was already covered with multiple injuries, his battle prowess dropping drastically. Either one of them was actually stronger than Wu Le.

However, it could not be helped that the Heavenly Venerate Wu Le was aiming to die together with either one of them with every move, and neither of them had the resolve to die with him. In fact, they were not willing to even sustain severe injuries. Thus, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le naturally had gotten the upper hand and the initiative.

But this kind of situation could not be maintained for too long. Under the pressure of battle of Heavenly Venerable Tiers, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s injuries would very soon explode, and he would be killed first by the heaven and earth without any interference from them.

“Do you really think that we cannot do anything to you?” Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was truly angered now. His forehead split apart, and a Divine Sword leaped out. Instantly, every person that wielded a sword felt their Sword Heart trembling as if it was about to crumble, and whether their sword was in their God Tool or otherwise, they were all moaning.
