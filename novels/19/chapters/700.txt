Chapter 701: Real Stars

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

However, the Rock Spirit was also more and more obedient; otherwise, this guy definitely would’ve run away with the heart of stone in its mouth and not look at him ingratiatingly, anticipating his approval.

“Brother Ling, your puppet is really human-like, not a bit like an ice cold puppet,” Wenren Qian Qian said sincerely.

The golem was instantly displeased, roaring angrily at Wenren Qian Qian... who was a puppet? It was a dignified worldly spirit, a life of the five elements that received the love of heaven.

Ling Han laughed loudly and stored the golem into the Black Tower, allowing it to refine the heart of stone and raise its tier as soon as possible. Actually, the effect would definitely have been better if he directly subdued the giant golem earlier; it was in the Deity Transformation Tier anyhow.

But, firstly, Ling Han didn’t want to unleash the Black Tower openly, and secondly, he was a person who valued feelings. Since the Rock Spirit paid allegiance to him, he would think of ways to increase its strength, and not just abandon it after seeing a stronger one.

The Rock Spirit should know this too, so it was even more loyal.

“Yes, quite remarkably so,” Ling Han said with a smile, but didn’t say that it was a Rock Spirit.

“Qian Qian always thought Brother Ling was known for sword techniques, but never expected your archery to be even more astonishing. That arrow even annihilated a Deity Transformation Tier Rock Spirit, such might is truly unimaginable,” Wenren Qian Qian exclaimed in admiration.

“Haha, Lady Wenren, no need put me on a pedestal.” Ling Han waved his hand. She was also their generation’s prodigy, and her talent probably wasn’t inferior to Zhu Xuan Er’s. He paused shortly, then went on, “Let’s go, we should continue on our way.”

They all nodded and advanced forward.

This area was surprisingly large, just as if the end could never be reached, but after half a day, the sun in the sky quickly vanished. In its place was a moon that emitted gentle rays of light, chilly like water.

Everyone was astonished. The master of this historical site had really invested thought and effort to simulate the environment here to be so similar to the outside world’s.

Even many stars hung in the sky.

Ling Han activated the Eye of Truth for a closer look. Earlier it was the sun, so he didn’t dare to stare too long, since that would blind his eyes. However, the moon was different. The damage of the rays of light was limited and he could completely endure it.

After a while, his expression changed drastically as he said, “Those are real stars, completely the same as the ones outside!”

“What?!” Everyone was visibly moved.

“Stars are meteors 1 and often contain rare high-level metals, which is why they glow in the skies,” Wenren Qian Qian said.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Above the firmament, a strange absorptive power set those meteors in place, so the starlit sky we see is fixed. Different at day and night, under the power of the world’s force, there’s a revolving trajectory.”

The rabbit said, “Actually, these stars are only several thousand miles away from us. If not for the existence of the astral winds, even Flower Blossom Tier elites would easily reach the ends of the sky.”

“But precisely because of the existence of astral winds, even Shattering Void Tier elites don’t dare to charge forcibly, only...” Ling Han followed, and made a chopping move at the sky.

The first step to splitting open the skies was cutting apart the astral winds, or else, unable to reach the heavens, how could one speak of splitting the skies?

“Shattering Void Tier beings are too powerful. The attacks they unleash can penetrate the astral wind layer and strike down the stars in the heavens, but when the stars pass through the astral wind layer, the majority would be worn away, and only a few amongst the few can fall down to the ground,” the rabbit continued. “Brat, are you seeing wrong? Those stars can’t possibly be the same as the ones outside.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m definitely not seeing wrong!” He contemplated, and said, “Then there’s only one possibility. A supreme being forcibly broke apart the astral wind layer and plucked those stars completely intact.”

“Plucking stars and capturing the moon, how powerful is that?” Wenren Qian Qian was dumbstruck. “This is something even Shattering Void Tier elites can’t do!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ling Han nodded. Shattering Void Tiers could shake down the stars in the sky. After all, it was only a long distance protected by the astral wind layer, but to charge through the astral wind layer and pluck the stars... the difficulty was completely not on the same level.

He couldn’t help but shiver inside. An ancient dynasty once thought to split the skies and failed in the end, leaving four treasure vaults. Could this historical site belong to the ancient dynasty? At the time, although they failed to split open the skies, breaking through the astral wind layer shouldn’t have been a problem, so plucking a few perfect stars was also within reason.

If it truly were so, the Purple Moon Empire and the five great sects being in a great hurry also stood to reason; it was a dynasty that was qualified to split the skies!

“It really is more and more tempting,” Ling Hand said with a smile.

Everyone sat down. Ling Han took out ingredients, while everyone began to prepare for dinner. Walking in such a dangerous place, they had to maintain their optimal condition at every moment, or else they could be grievously hurt.

Time was indeed precious, but they definitely shouldn’t advance rashly.

Wenren Qian Qian, as well as Li Feng Yu and his sister, obviously also prepared rations, but smelling the aroma of the food Ling Han and the others cooked, they couldn’t help but look edacious. After having a taste of their food, they instantly threw aside their ingredients and moved closer stiffly to get things to eat.

“Hmm, where’s the meat I placed here?” Li Feng Yu felt it strange. He’d just grilled a slice of meat and planned to take it to his sister, yet it suddenly disappeared.

His gaze swiveled by and stopped at the rabbit, and he said, “Uncle Rabbit, did you secretly eat it?”

The rabbit turned its head and said in disdain, “Pah, would Uncle Rabbit steal your food to eat?”

“Then what’s with your mouth’s chewing?”

“Uncle Rabbit naturally likes to squabble, is it not allowed?”

“The oil’s dripping out!”

“Nonsense, Uncle Rabbit’s a vegetarian!”

“You damned rabbit, the thief that stole!” Li Feng Yu was driven mad. This shameless rabbit, too lazy to grill things on its own, stealing things... too detestable.

The rabbit ignored him, and its ruby-like eyes circled randomly. With its temperament of unwilling to take losses, it was clearly taking revenge on Li Feng Yu’s big mouth because the other people were now looking at it vigilantly, greatly increasing the difficulty of stealing.

“Hmm, where’s the soup I placed here?” Ling Han was also shocked, and then looked at the rabbit and said, “Did you do it?”

“Such wrongful treatment. You guys lose things and just find Uncle Rabbit. Is Uncle Rabbit that kind of rabbit?” The rabbit jumped up, aggrieved.

“Yes!” Everyone nodded.

“Hmm, the bowl I placed here is also gone,” Zhu Xuan Er also said, feeling it strange.

“Nothing to do with Uncle Rabbit!” The rabbit hurriedly raised its claws before anyone asked.

“It indeed wasn’t the rabbit.” Ling Han shook his head. His divine sense was constantly locked onto the rabbit, and if the rabbit were to have any strange movements, it wouldn’t have escaped his notice. After all, his divine sense was at the Heaven Tier, even if it was just a shred of it.

Then who was it? Everyone wondered.

Hu Niu suddenly started to giggle, reaching out to grab something white, and said, “Let’s grill it and eat it!”
