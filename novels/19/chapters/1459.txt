Chapter 1460 Nine Heavens Flame

“The mortal enemy of the Hu Clan is Dark Moon City’s Ding Clan!”Hu Yu gritted his teeth as he said this, his voice filled with fury and resentment.

‘What? The Ding Clan?!’

Ling Han’s heart shuddered. ‘Could this be Ding Yaolong’s and Ding Zizhen’s Ding Clan?’

He didn’t have time to ask, as Hu Yu had already channeled the rare treasure and started to funnel it toward him.

“This is the Nine Heavens Flame, and it’s sealed inside this golden rock. External forces are unable to shatter this rock. This is a rare treasure that the Hu Clan obtained from an ancient historical site.

“There are 100 types of origin flames in the Immortal Realm, yet at their core, these flames are all descended from nine types of flames from the Celestial Realm. These nine flames are called the Nine Great Ancestral Flames, and these are the ancestors of all the flames in the world.

“The Nine Heavens Flame is one of these ancestral flames.

“Of course, this flame here is only a ‘young flame’ of the Nine Heavens Flame. It’s only just been born, and thus it doesn’t possess a terrifying might. Moreover, it’s been sealed into this Sun Stone by an ancient great elite. I’ll refine it into your body now. When you manage to fully refine this young flame and transform it into your source flame, this wisp of Nine Heavens Flame will eventually grow into an ancestral flame. At that time, you’ll gain unimaginable power. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s a shame that my damaged soul was only able to enter this Sun Stone after my death. It was only then that I finally managed to learn of its power.

“Stay focused and cooperate with me. This Nine Heavens Flame is an ancestral flame, and it still possesses a profound power even though it’s only a young flame, and even though it’s sealed inside a Sun Stone. If you’re not careful, you’ll be incinerated into ashes... F*ck!”

Hu Yu was still speaking, yet he was suddenly shocked to such an extent that he couldn’t help but curse.

He couldn’t help himself. After all, the sight before him was far too astounding.

The Nine Heavens Flame was being casually absorbed and refined by Ling Han, gradually fusing into his life force—into the portion that represented fire.

This was far too casual; this was far too smooth!

In Hu Yu’s estimation, it should have taken Ling Han at least 1,000,000 years to completely refine the Nine Heavens Flame. This was an ancestral flame, after all, something that even the mighty figures of the Celestial Realm would fight over! Why was it so gentle and obedient right now?

Little did he know that Ling Han had already tempered his body inside the immortal flames provided by the Black Tower numerous times. In fact, he had already tempered his body so much that he had mastered the secret technique, Rising From The Ashes. Right now, Hu Yu was telling him to refine an immortal flame, an ancestral flame. Yet, in reality, the might of this flame was far inferior to the might of the flames of Immortal Phoenixes. That being the case, what difficulty would Ling Han face when refining it?

Countless divine patterns materialized across Ling Han’s body, their complicated patterns far beyond any other technique that he had mastered.

In fact, these weren’t divine patterns, but celestial patterns!

Boom!

Scorching flames burst from Ling Han’s body, transforming into numerous Immortal Phoenixes. Under the stimulation of the ancestral flame, his grasp of the secret technique, Rising From The Ashes, was currently advancing at a rapid pace.

In the past, he could only rise from the ashes once. Afterward, he would need to spend a long time recovering the power of his life force before he could use the secret technique again. However, following his rapid advance, he now saw the potential to activate Rising From The Ashes twice in a row, perhaps even thrice!

Of course, right now was still too early for him to achieve this. At this moment, he was working toward being able to use Rising From The Ashes twice in a row. In any case, he had only just discovered this potential.

“Have I come across a freak?” Hu Yu murmured to himself. Ling Han’s talent was so great that he could be regarded as a top-notch prodigy, even in the Celestial Realm. Generally speaking, only the True Sons and True Daughters of top-notch sects could exhibit such tremendous talent. In fact, these prodigies might not even give him a shred of attention, even if he retrieved the entire wealth of the Hu Clan.

Of course, this was under the condition that he didn’t reveal the Nine Heavens Flame.

Yet, in this “backward” and “primitive” world, there was actually a prodigy who was just as talented as the True Sons and True Daughters of the Celestial Realm! This astonished him greatly. At the same time, it also delighted him immensely.

‘The Hu Clan... can finally exact its revenge!’

In reality, he had actually been more eager to see Gu Daoyi achieve victory. After all, this was a Divine Fetus who was no weaker than any prodigy in the Celestial Realm. However, it was a shame that Gu Daoyi hadn’t managed to make it to the peak.

Now, however, he was filled with delight. Ling Han was no weaker than Gu Daoyi!

“I’ll teach you the ultimate technique of the Hu Clan as you refine the Nine Heavens Flame,” Hu Yu said joyfully. “I’ll imprint it into your mind so that you can slowly comprehend it in the future. Regarding our revenge, this isn’t a pressing matter. It’s better that you act after coming up with a suitable plan. Although the Ding Clan isn’t a large clan in the Celestial Realm, with Severing Mundane Tier grand elders being their most powerful elites, there still exists an insurmountable gulf between celestials and immortals. Even if you’re a supreme prodigy, it’ll still be incredibly difficult to defeat those grand elders. Moreover, the Ding Clan has elites at the fourth severance of the Severing Mundane Tier. Their power is incredibly terrifying.”

As if he were afraid that Ling Han didn’t understand, he continued to explain this concept, saying, “Celestials are different from mortals or immortals. In order to reach the Celestial level, one must sever all of their mundane and worldly desires. The first slash severs heaven, the second earth, the third love, and the fourth karma. After severing these mundane matters, one will naturally become a being of themselves. In other words, one will become their own heaven and earth.

“After succeeding in the first slash, one will advance to the low extreme of the Severing Mundane Tier. Such elites are also referred to as first severance grand elders. The Ding Clan has fourth severance grand elders, and this corresponds to a cultivation at the consummate level of the Severing Mundane Tier. These are old freaks who have cultivated for heaven knows how many years. Before you have the absolute confidence to defeat them, you definitely can’t reveal your identity. Otherwise, you’ll place yourself into perilous danger!”

Ling Han couldn’t speak at this moment, and his mind was more so swimming with all kinds of mystical symbols. These were the symbols of the Hu Clan’s ultimate technique. In fact, he couldn’t even use his divine sense to communicate. All he could do was remain silent and listen.

“Great Evolution Technique!”

“Darkness of the Paramount Night!”

“Sword of Mundane Washing Rain!”

“Dark Grief Origin Dragon Destruction!”

“Song of the Ages!”

Countless secret techniques whirled inside Ling Han’s mind. However, not all of them were Celestial level secret techniques. The Hu Clan was only at the same level as the Ding Clan, with both of them being Severing Mundane Tier forces. Thus, only a limited number of their techniques were Celestial level secret techniques. The remaining techniques were all Genesis Tier secret techniques.

However, one of the celestial techniques astonished Ling Han greatly. In fact, this secret technique further strengthened his belief that this was indeed the Ding Clan of Ding Zizhen and Ding Yaolong.

Song of the Ages.

Not Tide of the Ages, but Song of the Ages. However, there was definitely an intimate relationship between these two celestial techniques. Moreover, one of the mystical symbols caused Ling Han to feel a strong sense of familiarity. If he comprehended this symbol under the Reincarnation Tree, he would be able to completely understand it after comprehending it for 100 years of real-time.

‘This celestial technique is more powerful!’

The Tide of the Ages only possessed a single ability—to age the attacks of the opponent. However, Song of the Ages could do even more than that. It could reverse the passage of time, allowing one to look into the past. In fact, this ability could even allow one to predict the future!

This was the complete version of the celestial technique. The Ding Clan had most likely raided the Hu Clan and obtained a copy of this celestial technique. Afterward, with the passing of time, this celestial technique had eventually become the bloodline inheritance of the Ding Clan—the Tide of the Ages. This also revealed that Ding Zizhen had most likely died far after the destruction of the Hu Clan.

Powerful celestial techniques could be fused into one’s bloodline and passed down onto future generations. However, following the destruction of the Hu Clan, the Song of the Ages had eventually become an ultimate technique of the Ding Clan. This was truly a twist of fate that would make one sigh with pity.

The Nine Heavens Flame took root inside Ling Han’s body, becoming his source flame. During this process, his cultivation naturally advanced as well. This was because the ancestral flame was far too powerful and high-level. Even though it was only fusing with Ling Han, it still brought him boundless and immeasurable benefits.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, the king tiers in the second stage were still bathed in the sweet dew and the blessings of heaven and earth.

In fact, this blessing of heaven and earth was bestowed by the Sun Stone. This was a rare treasure of the Celestial Realm, so even an iota of its power was enough to bring great benefits to the cultivators of the Immortal Realm and allow them to undergo astonishing transformations.

“It’s already been half a month, so why has it still not concluded yet?”

“In the past, it would have concluded after a maximum of 10 days!”

“Could it be because someone ascended that gigantic golden boulder?”

“These people are so fortunate!”

“Heh, some people are also incredibly unfortunate!”

The incredibly unfortunate people naturally included Zi Chenfeng, Long Xiangyue, Second in the World, and the other rank three king tiers. In stark contrast to them, Gu Daoyi was able to receive the blessings of heaven and earth because he had been locked in an intense battle with Empress Luan Xing at the time. His Divine Fetus was profoundly mysterious, and it was as if he were about to hover away with the wind and directly ascend into the Celestial Realm.

One month, two months, six months... The blessings of heaven and earth continued to shower the prodigies in the second stage of the valley. In fact, this mysterious event even astonished a Saint, who personally traveled over to check on the situation. Only after confirming that there was no harm being done to the prodigies did he leave the Sunken Abyss Valley.

One year, three years, five years!

Time slowly crept by. Most people had already left, yet their shock still had yet to dissipate. The blessings of heaven and earth were far too astonishing this time. Those who had reached the second stage of the competition were destined to soar far above all other prodigies.

This was already the case with the prodigies in the second stage, so what about Ling Han?
