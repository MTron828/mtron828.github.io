10,000 years had passed, and he was finally able to see his lover again.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was a prodigy, and she had advanced to the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier in just 10,000 years. The most beneficial aspect of this was that her countenance hadn’t aged a single bit. She was still just as beautiful as before.

She had been the number one beauty in the Lower Realm, and even after arriving in the Immortal Realm, she was still a breathtaking beauty. Otherwise, why would Prince Xie have fallen in love with her at first sight? However, beauties like her weren’t one of a kind anymore. If this weren’t the case, Xie Donglai would have had no chance with her. Numerous other higher-ups would have taken her as their concubine.

Why did men cultivate to become stronger? Wasn’t it for power and beautiful women?

Anyhow, after being stared at for so long, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden surprisingly noticed the unwelcome attention. She looked in Ling Han’s direction.

“What’s wrong?” a woman next to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked. She was an ordinary-looking woman, and she had noticed the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s slight change in expression.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden smiled faintly before shaking her head, and saying, “It’s nothing!”

However, a feeling of apprehension gripped at her heart. Had the Xie Clan found her already?

Ling Han watched as the brigade left the Purple Moon Army’s encampment. He then hurriedly followed after them.

The old ginseng caught up to Ling Han, and shouted, “Brat, don’t forget Grandpa Ginseng when you’re flirting with women!” Beautiful women and whatnot were his favorite.

Rabbit snickered, and said, “Good-for-nothing!” However, he also followed after them. This was because Ling Han was heading toward the depths of the Two Realm Passageway. He was still hoping that Ling Han would exact revenge for them.

The group of three “people” tailed the brigade of soldiers. However, the Regulations of heaven and earth in this place were especially strange, and this made it extremely hard to advance quickly. After walking for a day, they had only managed to advance 500 or so kilometers. Such a slow pace would be unfathomable in the outside world.

Night fell, and the brigade stopped to set up camp. They needed to rest for the night so that they could stay in peak condition.

Ling Han and the others stopped someplace far away from the brigade. They would also rest for the night.

However, the old ginseng was unwilling to behave, and he insisted on sneaking into the female’s camp during the night. In the end, he was viciously beaten by Ling Han. What a joke, his wife was in that camp, so how could he tolerate the old ginseng sneaking over to peep?

“Brat, you’re so disloyal! Can you really pick up so many women by yourself? You’re having the lion’s share, so can’t you at least leave some scraps for Grandpa Ginseng? A thousand curses upon you!” The old ginseng was both angry and exasperated.

“If you utter any more nonsense, I’ll cook you into soup!” Ling Han threatened.

“Do it! Do it!” Rabbit started to drool, and it said, “Uncle Rabbit will prepare some firewood!” He tossed a pile of firewood onto the ground. This wasn’t any ordinary firewood, but firewood that was made from rosewood. Fire lit on such kind of wood was extremely good for alchemy and tool refinement.

Using such firewood to cook... was incredibly extravagant.

The old ginseng was shocked. He pointed at Rabbit, and said, “Holy f*ck, you sh*tty rabbit, you were still calling me brother during the day. So, it turns out that you had your eyes on my flesh!”

“Carrot, if you don’t go to hell, who’s going to go to hell? Sacrifice yourself for the good of the world. Uncle Rabbit will remember you forever!” Rabbit pretended to be serious. It rubbed its chin, and said, “Little Han, should we wash this old ginseng first?”

“Wash your mom!” The old ginseng hurriedly fled into the distance. He was afraid that they would become serious, and really chop him into pieces.

Ling Han wasn’t in the mood to deal with these two living treasures. He started to mull over how he would strike a conversation with the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

The next day, the brigade of soldiers broke camp, and advanced another 500 or so kilometers.

They repeated this process, and after four days, they arrived in the depths of the Two Realm Battlefield. The surroundings became increasingly harsh. Not only was there a lack of Spiritual Qi, but the clash between Regulations also became increasingly evident. The Regulations of the Immortal Realm were stronger in some places, while the Regulations of the Netherworld were stronger in other places.

This led to a strange phenomenon. For two beings who were equally as powerful—one from the Immortal Realm and one from the Netherworld—the being from the Immortal Realm would be stronger in some places, while the being from the Netherworld would be stronger in other places.

Thus, it was extremely important to pick a suitable location if one wanted to battle in this place. Otherwise, those who should win might end up losing, and those who should lose might end up turning the tables.

Anyhow, the brigade from the Purple Moon Army finally came across Netherworld military on this day.

This was also a small brigade. After noticing each other, they faced off for a short moment before immediately launching into an intense battle.

‘This is my chance!’

Ling Han immediately charged toward the Netherworld army.

When coming across beings from the Netherworld, everyone had a responsibility to battle against them. Moreover, it would be much easier to visit the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and strike a conversation with her if they developed camaraderie in battle.

Beings of the Netherworld were starkly different from beings of the Immortal Realm.

All of them were surrounded by a sinister and eerie aura. They could be easily recognized with a glance.

If the Immortal Realm was yang, then the Netherworld would be yin; if the Immortal Realm was fire, then the Netherworld would be water. These two realms were like the two sides of a coin. Their stark differences stemmed from the essence of their very being, and this wasn’t a difference that could be erased.

The members of the Netherworld army were all humanoid, yet some of them had horns, while others had tails. Moreover, due to the sinister aura that surrounded them, they appeared completely different from the human forms of the Demonic Beasts from the Immortal Realm.

Most of them wielded spears, while a few of them wielded swords or sabers. Their battle prowess ranged from the Mountain River Tier to the Sun Moon Tier.

The battle prowess of the Purple Moon Army was identical to their opponent’s. Thus, the battle was extremely intense and dangerous.

Ling Han didn’t speak, and immediately started to attack the enemies.

He didn’t wield his Divine Demon Sword, and simply used his fists to smash his enemies into pieces.

Although he wasn’t using his most powerful techniques, he had already obtained a wisp of heaven’s might. Thus, his fists naturally possessed a profound might. If his enemy weren’t as powerful as him, they would be wounded if they were scraped, and they would be killed if they were hit.

He was like a killing machine, and he was essentially able to kill an enemy with each punch. He placed their corpses in the Black Tower—he could use these to exchange merit points, so he naturally wouldn’t waste them.

After killing a dozen or so Netherworld soldiers, he finally attracted the attention of an elite. It was a Netherworld elite who was dressed in a full suit of armor. He brandished his spear as he charged toward Ling Han.

“Humph!” There was a humph, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden also leaped over. There was a pair of phoenix wings that measured 50 kilometers in length on her back, and they possessed raging flames that could incinerate everything within 500 kilometers with a single flap.

Tens of thousands of flaming feathers burst from the phoenix wings and shot toward the Netherworld elite.

“I’ve got this place under control! You go somewhere else!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said.

‘Tsk, are our hearts connected? She already knows to come over and protect her husband?’

Ling Han laughed loudly, and didn’t linger around. He immediately charged toward the other Netherworld beings. Like a knife through hot butter, he easily massacred the weaker Sun Moon Tier elites.

With his help, all of the weaker Sun Moon Tier elites were quickly killed. Right now, only the seven consummate level elites remained. They had no desire to continue fighting, and they quickly retreated and fled into the distance.

The Purple Moon Army pursued them for a while. However, elites at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier weren’t easy to kill. In the end, they weren’t able to kill any of them, and were only able to severely wound one of them.

“Little brother, thanks for your help!” The members of the Purple Moon Army thanked Ling Han after counting their losses.

“Fighting against the Netherworld is everybody’s responsibility,” Ling Han said. He then turned to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and said, “Miss, thank you for helping me just then.”
