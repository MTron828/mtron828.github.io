Chapter 1765: Annihilating the Ding Clan

With his hands freed, Ling Han started to chase after and attack Ding Song and the other Severing Mundane Tier grand elders.

Who could escape from his lightning?

Meanwhile, the Empress also summoned her nine clones, each of which was a king tier among king tiers at the second severance. Moreover, since Ding Song had already been targeted by Ling Han, who else could rival her and her clones?

Mao Dai hesitated for a moment before also resolutely joining the battle.

With so many elites ganging up to attack them, the Ding Clan was now facing an overwhelming existential crisis.

This was their karma!

In the past, the Ding Clan had tricked the Hu Clan, and borrowed the power of Celestial King forces to annihilate the Hu Clan. To say nothing of the Black Moon Sect, even the Fu Clan hadn’t dared to say anything about this.

Now, however, they were facing the heavy consequences.

“Grand Elder!”

“Ancestor!”

“Damn it!”

The members of the Ding Clan were all screaming in shock and fury. Almost none of them surrendered, and many of them chose to resist until the very end. However, how could they rival the power of third severance and fourth severance grand elders? Apart from Ding Yaolong, the rest of the Ding Clan was completely and thoroughly massacred!

However, if they didn’t kill Ding Yaolong, he would eventually flee with his Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, and create another Ding Clan elsewhere.

Thus, Ding Yaolong had to die, and the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts had to be destroyed.

The grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan started to unleash increasingly powerful and furious attacks. Things had already come to this, so there was already no path of retreat. They had to carry through to the end and resolutely kill Ding Yaolong.

“Old geezers, you’re seeking death!” Ding Yaolong roared. There was a murderous gleam in his eyes, and he continued, “After I flee, I’ll definitely take the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts for a stroll around your clans! I’ll let you experience the feeling of losing your entire clan!”

“In your dreams!” Ling Han roared as he charged over. He activated his Immovable Deity Metal Body, and he unleashed powerful celestial techniques from each of his six hands. His battle prowess rose by a whopping tenfold.

At this moment, his battle prowess could roughly rival that of elites at the early stage of the fourth severance. Although he was still too weak to rival those at the peak stage of the fourth severance, his powerful physique meant that he wouldn’t be easily defeated by them, either.

With Ling Han’s help, the pressure on the grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan instantly decreased by a significant amount.

Why was Ling Han participating in this battle?

If Ding Yaolong unleashed a sacrificial technique to kill both himself and his opponents, Ling Han would resolutely step forward to block his attack. Moreover, he would be completely unscathed at that time.

What was the most frightening thing when battling against those at the same cultivation level? Was it not sacrificial techniques that could kill both the host and their opponents?

To say nothing of battling two against one, even if it were a battle of 10 against one, the single person might still be able to kill one of their opponents if they unleashed a sacrificial technique. After all, which of those at the Severing Mundane Tier wasn’t a prodigy among prodigies? However, with Ling Han’s participation, Ding Yaolong was stripped of the right to even unleash such a sacrificial technique.

That being the case, the elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan instantly felt much more at ease. At the same time, they could also unleash their powerful attacks with more confidence.

On the contrary, Ding Yaolong was feeling extremely frustrated and stifled.

He had already been facing immense pressure when fighting against the two grand elders who were at the same cultivation level as him. Although Ling Han was slightly weaker than them, with only a battle prowess at the early stage of the fourth severance, Ding Yaolong still wasn’t able to completely ignore his attacks!

‘How is this brat’s defensive ability so powerful?’

Ding Yaolong was on the verge of tears. He had even been stripped of the right to unleash a sacrificial attack! How vexing would it be if he were to die here today?

“Aaaah!” he roared in fury and indignance. He was the only remaining member of the Ding Clan, and he had already been pushed into a corner of despair. In fact, he couldn’t even sacrifice his life to kill his opponents. This caused him to almost explode with rage and frustration.

“Commit fewer evils in your next life!” Ling Han said coldly. He unleashed his Tide of the Ages, completely shattering Ding Yaolong’s secret technique of time. This was an extremely powerful secret technique that pertained to the power of time. In fact, with the protection of this secret technique, Ding Yaolong could even gain the ability to fight against two grand elders at the same cultivation level as him.

“However, you’ve already committed far too many evils in this lifetime, so you won’t have an opportunity to be reborn as a human in your next life!”

“Brat, I’ll kill you even if it means death!” Ding Yaolong howled. His eyes were bloodshot as he furiously lunged at Ling Han.

Ling Han snickered upon hearing this. Even if he didn’t channel his Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, Ding Yaolong would still need to use the power of Regulations to slowly refine him to death. Ding Yaolong definitely wouldn’t be able to kill him using brute strength.

That being the case, how could Ding Yaolong kill him?

In any case, he still had the Indestructible True Fluid. Thus, even if he were truly killed, he could still rise from the ashes and revive.

Ding Yaolong would definitely be terrified to death if he learned of this!

“Old bastard, go die!” Ling Han shouted as he exchanged blows with Ding Yaolong. Although he was sent flying time and time again, he would always use Lightning Flash to immediately charge over again. Ding Yaolong was completely obstructed by him.

The grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan seized this opportunity to furiously attack Ding Yaolong. If they couldn’t kill him while holding such an overwhelming advantage, they would be absolute embarrassments of fourth severance grand elders. If that were the case, they might as well find a slab of tofu to slap themselves to death.

Ding Yaolong was riddled with wounds that were becoming more and more severe.

However, he was being surrounded and attacked by three great elites, so he couldn’t even find an opportunity to escape and flee. He could only fight to the death. Yet, fighting to the death would be completely meaningless. After all, Ling Han was an absolute freak who could even block his sacrificial attacks. Upon thinking of this, Ding Yaolong felt so frustrated that he almost spat a mouthful of blood.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Dozens of attacks from the grand elders of the Long Clan and the Duan Clan slammed into Ding Yaolong’s back, causing him to vomit blood and stumble back in retreat. However, this also caused him to become increasingly wild and furious as he charged after Ling Han. He refused to believe that Ling Han’s defenses were invincible!

However, he was destined to be disappointed.

He was being relentlessly attacked, and this caused his battle prowess to be greatly affected. After all, he had already expended a huge amount of his life force and energy to increase the power of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts. Thus, how could he unleash any more power?

In fact, Ding Yaolong would violently spit a mouthful of blood with each attack that he launched. He naturally couldn’t withstand this kind of expenditure, regardless of how much blood he had. Thus, after reaching a certain limit, his aura instantly started to fall significantly.

The grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan were ecstatic upon seeing this. From today onward, there would be no more Ding Clan!

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!” Ding Yaolong threw his head back and roared in fury. His chest was already shattered, and blood was violently spurting from his heart. His vitality was also rapidly draining away. However, there was still anger and indignance in his wide-open eyes.

A grand elite at the peak stage of the fourth severance was killed just like that.

Ling Han threw another punch, unleashing his Nine Heavens Flame to incinerate the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts.

Shrill wails echoed through the air, and numerous projections of vengeful ghosts rose from the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts. This was the final struggle of the evil weapon. However, without the power of its master, and due to its huge expenditure from before, the struggle of the 10,000 ghosts seemed extremely frail and listless. It wasn’t long before the numerous formation patterns on its surface were refined and erased. These formation patterns were the reason that it had become an evil weapon.

Ling Han then retrieved his Divine Demon Sword to slash at the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts, absorbing the Godly metal essence that was contained within this evil weapon. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If he hadn’t erased the formation patterns first, the Divine Demon Sword wouldn’t have been able to absorb the Godly metal essence from the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts. This was because the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts would have instinctively counterattacked. Moreover, the Divine Demon Sword was currently unable to defeat this evil weapon.

The grand elders from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan silently observed this scene. Only when the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts was comprehensively destroyed did they calmly nod, finally at ease.

This evil weapon was far too threatening to them.

Ling Han also nodded at the two grand elders in acknowledgment before casually leaving the scene.

With his current power, he naturally didn’t need to lower his head before these two grand elders. He had clearly displayed his power in the battle just then.

However, Ling Han didn’t leave Dark Moon City.

The resources of the Ding Clan were a huge slice of cake, so he naturally wouldn’t leave it to the others. If the Long Clan and the Duan Clan split the territory of the Ding Clan but didn’t give him any benefits... Heh, if that were the case, their eyes must have been clouded by greed.

Sure enough, the two grand elders personally came to visit him after a few days. After some polite chatter, they handed Ling Han a Spatial God Tool. Ling Han inspected its contents on the spot, and a satisfied smile immediately spread across his face.
