1339 Five Element Body

“Simple. Using the power of the Five Elements, you would be able to build a Five Element Body,” Small Tower said calmly, appearing completely nonchalant.

True. The Black Tower should also be an ultimate precious treasure in the Celestial Realm as well, and in the Celestial Realm, there had to be plenty of Saints. Hence, in the eyes of Small Tower, the Notionless Saint had to be no stronger than any ordinary dog.

“Teach me,” Ling Han said. This was something that he had promised the Notionless Saint, so he definitely had to fulfill his promise.

Small Tower taught him a chant about how to condense the Five Elements to form a Five Element Body. Furthermore, it also added a forbidden secret technique within this chant. With a thought from itself or Ling Han, they could easily destroy this Five Element Body.

This was a ‘just in case’ measure. As long as the Notionless Saint bore no malicious intent, everything would naturally be fine, but what if he wanted to turn the tables around and snatch away the Black Tower the moment he recovered the cultivation level of a Saint?

Ling Han hesitated slightly, and then passed his agreement on Small Tower’s action.

One had to keep his guard up against others, so it was best to be cautious. Additionally, if the Notionless Saint bore no malicious intent, then this preventive measure would never be activated in future—or when Ling Han’s cultivation level also advanced into the Genesis Tier as he naturally would not need to take this to heart any longer.

As long as the raw materials were ready, condensing a Five Element Body would become very easy. Very soon, Ling Han had built a new body, then used a certain power of the Black Tower to activate it, and this body now possessed a powerful vitality.

Without a soul, it could not be considered a living being, but it was the best object to possess.

With a thought, Ling Han built another body like this. This one was prepared for the Asura Demon Emperor.

“Senior, this is the Five Element Body I promised you,” Ling Han said, and placed this body underneath the Reincarnation Tree.

The ball of light that the Notionless Saint had taken form in trembled wildly. Though he had long since prepared himself mentally, when this moment truly came, even he, a Saint, would feel uncontrollably moved and excited.

However, a Saint was a Saint, after all. He had endured who knew how many trials and hardships, and quickly calmed his heart. With a flash, the ball of light that he had taken form in had sank into this body.

Pa, a finger of the Five Element Body slightly moved. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and the upper half of his body was erect.

Now, this was the Notionless Saint.

He raised a hand and looked at it in excitement, an expression of wild happiness appearing on his face.

Even if he was a Saint, he was still unable to make his damaged soul possess another and come back to life. Now, he could feel that he was weak but filled with vitality.

Though this body had been built from the Five Elements, it was not much different from a mortal body. Presently, the Notionless Saint was only an ordinary mortal. However, this body possessed unlimited possibilities. He could cultivate to the Shattering Void Tier, Heavenly Body Tier, or even Genesis Tier.

Furthermore!

With a thought of the Notionless Saint, an incredibly majestic aura immediately surged out of him. This was the aura of the Genesis Tier.

Within the Black Tower, Ling Han naturally needed not fear the aura of Genesis Tier, but he could acutely sense that the Notionless Saint was actually strong in appearance, but was weak in reality.

This was indeed the aura of a Saint, but there was not the slightest destructive power contained in it. It could only be used as a scare tactic. If he encountered a rash hothead that moved with complete disregard, then this Notionless Saint would definitely be pummelled to a bundle of wounds and bruises, exposing his true self completely.

There was nothing that could be done about it. At the time, the Notionless Saint had refined himself, and merely left behind a ball of pure experience, and the body he possessed now was a mortal body as well, so he naturally could not possibly have the slightest bit of the might of a Saint anymore.

Being able to have this kind of aura as a scare tactic was already quite good.

“Senior, recover your cultivation level as soon as possible.” Ling Han left behind some alchemical pills. With how bountiful the natural resources and extraordinary the effects of Godly medicine in the Immortal Realm were, it would be enough to help the Notionless Saint return to the Mountain River Tier in the shortest amount of time possible. After the Mountain River Tier, the Notionless Saint possessed a complete set of cultivation experience, so he would only have to accumulate some Origin Power, and his cultivation level naturally would soar up quickly.

“All right. Go on, I, this lord, this old fellow...” The Notionless Saint was a little over-excited that he didn’t even know how to address himself anymore. “Go on, go on. I need to go into seclusion to cultivate. At least I have to cultivate to Mountain River Tier first.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Han smiled, and summoned the Asura Demon Emperor with a thought.

“My noble master, what is your command for summoning this incredibly loyal Little Asura?” the Asura Demon Emperor said in his most bootlicking voice. His eyes were bright. Master had broken through to the Heavenly Body Tier; this speed was inconceivable.

Naturally, the more awesome his master, the more he could use his powerful connections as an intimidation. Hence, in front of Ling Han, he put on his humblest attitude to gain Ling Han’s favor and trust.

Ling Han tossed out the Five Element Body, and said, “This will be your body from now onwards. Work hard on cultivation.”

Without another word, the Asura Demon Emperor immediately entered into the body. To him, Ling Han’s words were akin to a royal decree.

“Master, why is this body so weak?” However, he was immediately shocked. He had initially thought master had given him another powerful body, but this body was pitifully weak.

“Of course it’s weak. This is a mortal body,” Ling Han said, smiling.

“Ah...” The Asura Demon Emperor was filled with confusion.

Ling Han said, “Though this body is not powerful, it possesses true vitality and life. If you cultivate with this body, you can obtain endless possibilities. Though it is very weak at the moment, I believe that you would be able to surpass your current cultivation level without taking too long.

“Furthermore, you are a spirit of the Netherworld, yet possess a body of the Immortal Realm. By nature, you would be able to communicate with both Realms, and in future, it is very possible that you could grasp the Regulations of the two Realms at the same time, and break through to the Genesis Tier!”

Only now did realization dawn on the Asura Demon Emperor. He almost broke out into tears, and said, “Thank you for your concern and care, Master. How is this Little Asura deserving of such high hopes from Master? This Little Asura will definitely strive to the utmost until my dying day.”

Naturally, these were merely empty words. Only he himself knew how much of what he said was truth and how much was false.

It was an incredibly hard thing to become a Saint, and he was supposed to climb a level higher than that?

The Asura Demon Emperor naturally did not have that much confidence in himself.

His ambitions were very simple. Be a good dog for Ling Han so he could bite anyone he wanted anywhere he liked—he was filled with confidence in Ling Han, and thought that Ling Han would definitely be able to become a Saint in the Immortal Realm, and if he entered into the Celestial Realm, he would also definitely be capable of becoming a powerful figure.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be amused, though his expression did not change. He coldly uttered, “Work hard on your cultivation. If I discover that your rate of advancement is slower than the other side, I will murder you.”

“Ah!” The Asura Demon Emperor howled. It should be known that the Notionless Saint had once been an existence of Genesis Tier, and even if both of them were now presently starting from the beginning all over again, the latter’s rate of advancement would definitely surpass his.

Then wouldn’t he definitely be dead?

“Master!” he exclaimed miserably, his face filled with ingratiation.

“If you have the time to curry favor, why don’t you make the most of your time to cultivate?” Ling Han humphed.

“Oh!” Asura Demon Emperor could only nod and race back to the roots of the Reincarnation Tree to cultivate.

It was time to seek out the Five Sects for an accounting!

Ling Han walked out of the plains, and flew up into the skies. What had been a deep abyss in the past was no longer a problem to the present him. The evil beast that had released a pulling power had already been killed, and he soon arrived on the ground surface.
