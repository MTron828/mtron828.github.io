2815 Instigating

Ling Han insisted on staying here, so the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and the others did not persuade him further, and left.

Even if Ling Han guessed correctly, and the balance between the three great Heavenly Venerates would be broken when a fourth Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate arrived, Ling Han would be the only one that could take hold of that fleeting instant. Otherwise, someone with the strength of a First Tier or Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would only be instantly killed by a Fourth Tier.

Ling Han’s companions left, hoping that there wasn’t anybody as overbearing as these blocking the entrance in the other three palaces.

Ling Han waited patiently. In any case, he was not wasting time, as he was presently modifying the Fists of Fury.

This process needed an extensive amount of time. Thankfully, though his Time physique could not take effect on his physical body, there was completely no problem with providing a boost to his divine sense, allowing him to slowly stroll in the extensive flow of time.

It had already been a long time since Ling Han had last studied the Fists of Fury. That was because he had long ago obtained a Heavenly Venerate Technique, its might far surpassing Fists of Fury, so what need was there for him to expend the effort?

It was only now when the Heavenly Venerate Technique could no longer catch up to his battle prowess that he was forced to study Fists of Fury.

Time passed by endlessly, and Ling Han’s improvement came very fast. The might of Fists of Fury soared, reaching peak-stage Ninth Heaven.

But after that, it slowed down. What Heavenly Venerate Technique had not been created through countless years of accumulated experience and knowledge? Even if Ling Han used his Time physique, whereby one day was equivalent to close to three years under normal conditions, he was still unable to complete his breakthrough in a short period of time.

Ling Han was not worried. This was something that he had produced from his own studies. As long as it advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, his battle prowess would definitely spike greatly.

After several days, Ling Han was still stuck with the Heavenly Venerable Tier. He stopped. This was not something that could be done overnight; he should have a change of pace.

‘Huh?

He paused slightly, and realized that there were currently a few familiar people walking towards him.

…It was Ping Xinghai and his group.

They had actually come here as well?

Ling Han’s eyes darted around, and a smile appeared at the corners of Ling Han’s lips. If there was anyone who was familiar with him, they would be able to guess that this guy had to be having some mischievous plans in mind.

With Ling Han’s thought, his appearance changed again, and his aura also changed accordingly. Those stronger than him could see through his disguise, but under circumstances when strength was equal on both sides, this was very safe.

Ling Han did not move immediately, but rather waited first.

Ping Xinghai naturally was stopped by those three Fourth Tiers as well. He was just a Third Tier, and though this was already enough to stand among the ranks at the summit of the Genesis World, a Fourth Tier was still enough to overcome a Third Tier. There was completely no need to give any face.

He was very angered, and had even announced the name of his master, yet those three people still refused to bend at all.

This had gone too far. Didn’t they know that his master was a Fifth Tier?

When Ling Han saw how this guy’s expression became menacing, he felt like it was about time, and thus strode out.

“Halt, what do you want?” a First Tier immediately yelled at Ling Han.

Ling Han raised his clasped fists. “I am Nalan Qingkong, and I have a matter to discuss with Brother Ping.”

“How dare you? A mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate actually dares to treat a Third Tier as an equal?” That First Tier Heavenly Venerate’s eyes turned cold as he glared at Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled. “Brother Ping, don’t you think those three people have gone too far by sealing off the doorway and forbidding us entry?”

Originally, Ping Xinghai had ignored Ling Han completely, but these words just happened to be exactly what he was feeling, making his expression change slightly. He looked towards Ling Han. “What ideas do you have?”

He was very displeased. Previously, before they had entered here, their forces had been already damaged, and now they were even blocked off from entering.

When had he suffered such treatment before?

Ling Han smiled, and said, “While the might of Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates is frightening, Brother Ping is the disciple of a lord Fifth Tier, and you yourself are a Third Tier. You only have to holler, and with the displeasure of everyone present, they would definitely all unite underneath Brother Ping’s banner. By then, everyone could rush forth together, and a great number of people would definitely be able to barge in through that door.

Ping Xinghai hesitated slightly, yet humphed, and retorted, “Are you trying to use me like a tool?”

This guy was not stupid.

True, how could any idiot be able to become a Heavenly Venerate?

Ling Han naturally would not give up, and continued, “Your words are incorrect, Brother Ping. When one comes across injustice, one should stand up. We are all cultivators, so isn’t what we are pursuing the settling of debts of gratitude and revenge quickly? Though those three lords are strong, they still can’t blot out the heavens with one hand.

“It is one thing for them to be strong and enter first. But they have not gained anything, yet still wish to stop others. That is going too far!

“I think that with Brother Ping’s natural talent and strength, you will definitely be able to breeze through the test left behind by that ancient Heavenly Venerate. Doing such a thing is completely eating away at Brother Ping’s fated opportunity. This has really gone too far!”

These words were reasonable and justified, and added with the fact that Ping Xinghai had been displeased in the first place, it easily resulted in a resonance; he humphed. Though he had not replied, he was already moved.

Ling Han continued further, paying a considerable number of compliments, so disgustingly sweet that even he himself wanted to throw up.

After long periods of time in the large black dog’s company, not only was Ling Han top-tier in the ability to throw insults, his ability of pushing others onto a pedestal was not to be underestimated, either, his every word eliciting satisfaction from Ping Xinghai.

It should be known that Ping Xinghai was presently in a state of displeasure. Previously, his lackeys had been killed, and now they were blocked here. Though his three lackeys were still being yes-men to him, they bore a lot of secret resentment for him. He knew about this, but he had indeed experienced a great loss at Ling Han’s hands, so he could not refute it.

Now, with Ling Han pushing him further and further up onto a pedestal, he naturally felt extremely pleased.

“All right. It can be no one but me, so I shall take this responsibility.” Ping Xinghai nodded, appearing very heroic.

The reason he could be persuaded was naturally because of himself. Just like how Ling Han had said, Ping Xinghai had absolute trust in his natural talent. He was certain that he would be able to barge through the test ahead, and obtain the inheritance of that ancient Heavenly Venerate.

…Defeated by Ling Han, he presently felt an incredible yearning for a higher-level Heavenly Venerable Seal.

Ping Xinghai was swift in his decision. Immediately, he began to move, communicating with the various groups.

He himself was a Third Tier, and added with the fact that he was backed by a Fifth Tier, there really were a considerable number that were willing to join him. Previously, it was because no one was organizing them, so they were in a state of disunity. Now that they had allied together, they could no longer be underestimated.

There were a considerable number of people here that were backed by Fourth Tiers and Fifth Tiers, and they were sure that these three Fourth Tiers would not dare to deliver a fatal strike against them.

Led by Ping Xinghai, they approached the entrance to the palace.

“My three lords…” Ping Xinghai clasped his fists together respectfully. “We respect the three of you very much, and we are certain that the three lords would also be understanding of us and our feelings of wanting to venture into this space to explore. We dearly hope that the three lords can accommodate us.”

A Fourth Tier looked towards Ping Xinghai. “You people have schemed for two days, and it is all so that you can force us to step aside?”

Before Ping Xinghai had the chance to speak, Ling Han butted in. “You three old geezers, could it be that you people don’t know who our Young Master Ping is? He is a noble, dignified Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, and his master is a Fifth Tier. So what if he demands that you three step aside? What disagreement do you have about that?”

Gasp!

Ping Xinghai couldn’t help but inhale sharply. How could Ling Han say these words?

Even if Ping Xinghai was thinking the same thing, he could not say it out loud, and definitely could not say these words in full public, right to their faces. That would be sparking off a war.

...

“How dare you!!” a Fourth Tier dressed in black robes rebuked with a glare, exuding boundless might, and the other two Fourth Tiers also looked menacing, looking like they were ready to attack.

Ping Xinghai hurriedly tried to make amends, and said, “My three lords, please don’t—”

“Don’t be arrogant. We have the advantage in numbers, so what do we have to fear from you guys?” Ling Han butted in again.

‘Holy! F*ck!’
