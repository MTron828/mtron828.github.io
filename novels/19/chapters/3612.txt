Chapter 3613: Greatly renowned

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

What kind of definite statement was this?

Ling Han shook his head. He was who he was. Did he need to rely on Luo Xi and Qian Senlai to make a name for himself?

“What is it? Do you want to be the third person to be defeated by me?” he asked calmly, not bothering to explain.

“Wrong, I’m here to defeat you and prove that I am the strongest in Mystery Realm Tier!” the golden-robed person said.

Ling Han scoffed. Even if he was really defeated, it didn’t mean anything, because he was only an Enlightenment Tier.

Why did everyone think that he was a Mystery Realm Tier?

Boom!

The golden-robed figure had already launched an attack. He shot out a kick. Whoosh! A gust of wind whistled through the air, with black-colored energy entwined around it. It was as if this energy had transformed into black metal.

Ling Han was startled at first, and thought that the other had also mastered the Destructive Energy. He even got a shock from it, but he immediately came to his senses. That was not the Destructive Energy, but rather the Energy of Metal. It was only manifested in a black colour.

He threw a punch, directly using the Frequency Attack of seventy overlapping layers of power.

Peng, it was only a single strike, and the golden-robed man was sent flying. With a plop, he fell into the lake waters.

“Huh? Why is he so weak?” Ling Han murmured to himself. Compared to Luo Xi and Qian Senlai, this person’s strength was far inferior.

The golden-robed figure leaped out and stepped on the water’s surface.

Yi, he could actually stand on the waves?

Ling Han took a closer look. Oh, so it turned out that the golden-robed figure’s feet had been rapidly stomping all this while, and only then did it provide enough power for him to stay afloat on the surface of the water.

The golden-robed man’s face was flushed red. He had naturally heard Ling Han’s words.

He was ranked thirty-fourth in Peaceful Splendor County, and his name was Pei Guan. Although the ranking didn’t represent absolute strength, there was actually only a gap of a few places. It was definitely impossible for battle prowess that was ranked tenth to fall to the rank of thirtieth or fortieth.

Thus, he was far inferior to Luo Xi and Qian Senlai. He couldn’t even withstand a single strike from Ling Han.

Of course, it was not that he was too weak, but rather that after Ling Han modified Frequency Attack, his battle prowess had become even stronger.

He was extremely embarrassed.

He had clearly come to defeat Ling Han, and afterwards, he could boast that his battle prowess in the Mystery Realm Tier had even surpassed Luo Xi and Qian Senlai, but what was the result?

Terrible!

He did not make another move. This gap was really too wide. He was no match at all, so how was he supposed to fight?

He turned around to flee.

“Wait!” Yet Ling Han blocked him, “Do you think this is a shop you are visiting? You can come and go as you please?”

“What are you going to do?” the golden-robed person asked.

“Rob you!” Ling Han said with a smile.

The golden-robed man couldn’t help but feel speechless. ‘Aren’t you a prodigy? Why are you suddenly going to become a thief?’

He wanted to break out of the siege, but how could he be a match for Ling Han? He was apprehended in a few moves.

Ling Han fished out his Spatial Spirit Tool, but seeing that the golden silk robes he was wearing was not too bad, he forcibly removed it as well.

This wasn’t a Battle Armor, but its material was extraordinary. It could provide a very good defense. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It would be a waste not to take it.

“You are welcome to visit again,” Ling Han said with a smile. He had always welcomed wealth-delivering boys. “Oh, that’s right. Tell the others that if they want to challenge me, prepare the essence of water. Otherwise, they’ll inevitably be robbed by me.”

Pei Guan left in shame and anger. His skills were inferior. It was one thing for him to lose, but he had actually been robbed completely. How could he endure this?

Originally, he had not wanted to reveal the scandal of his defeat, but the figure that had fled in such a sorry state had been spotted. Naturally, the truth had been pieced together, and then publicized it widely.

There was a Wide Star Vine here, so distance wasn’t a problem at all. Very soon, the news spread throughout Peaceful Splendor County.

Since the scandal had been exposed, Pei Guan simply revealed Ling Han’s request. He now had an idea. He couldn’t allow himself to suffer such humiliation alone. If there were more people, he wouldn’t stand out.

And even more truths were dug out. As it turned out, this mysterious person’s name was Ling Han, and had once defeated Zhang Qihua when he was in Extreme Flame Valley, and even killed Lei Jiujun.

When these two pieces of news spread out, Peaceful Splendor County erupted in an absolute commotion.

This person was too awesome, wasn’t he? Could it be that he was really invincible in Mystery Realm Tier?

When the news spread out, it instantly attracted even more people to look for Ling Han. Even among those top-notch prodigies ranked in the top seven, there were a few that announced that they might be going to meet Ling Han.

Ling Han’s place became very lively, and he would be challenged from time to time.

Some people really did bring the essence of water. For this kind of people, after Ling Han defeated them, he would let them off the hook after collecting the essence of water, but if they did not bring the essence of water and came to fight, then sorry, they would be directly beaten to the ground and robbed.

The more people that were defeated, the greater Ling Han’s reputation became. He vaguely gained the title of being top in Mystery Realm Tier.

In this manner, even Ge Tong, Sang Xing, Yan Leshui and the others could no longer sit still. They were ranked in the top five of the younger generation of Peaceful Splendor County. Originally, they would not deign to lower themselves to the level of a Mystery Realm Tier cultivator, but now, everyone was comparing them to Ling Han, and thought that they would definitely be inferior to Ling Han in Mystery Realm Tier.

Otherwise, why wouldn’t they challenge Ling Han?

It was obvious that they were afraid of losing.

Xing Taichu, who was ranked sixth, was the first to step out, saying that he was going to suppress Ling Han.

In the end, two days later, news spread out that he had been defeated by Ling Han. Not only had his Spatial Spirit Tool been snatched, even his undergarments had been stripped completely, and he had shamefully had the experience of running around naked.

—Who asked him not to bring the essence of water?

Subsequently, Yang Cheng, who was ranked fifth, also moved, and similarly suffered a terrible defeat. Then, it was Li Mingxu, who was ranked fourth, and it was still inevitable that he would suffer a terrible defeat.

Ge Tong, Sang Xing, and Yan Leshui were under immense pressure. If they lost again, it would be equivalent to saying that the younger generation of Peaceful Peace County had lost to Ling Han in Mystery Realm Tier.

Under such pressure, they treasured their reputation even more, and were unwilling to make a move easily.

Ge Tong, for example, had announced that he disdained from fighting with Ling Han at all.

Who was he?

As an elite of Heavenly Dao Foundation, why would he lower himself to have a “fair” battle with a Mystery Realm Tier?

There was no such thing as a fair battle in the cultivation world. There was only the survival of the fittest.

Thus, it was impossible for him to go to the Cold Water Lake. However, if Ling Han dared to appear in front of him, he wouldn’t mind casually suppressing him.

Sang Xing and Yan Leshui also said similar words. So what if they defeated Ling Han? So what if he really was invincible in Mystery Realm Tier?

They were Foundation Building elites, so their target was naturally not the prodigies of Peaceful Splendor County, but rather the top prodigies of the other counties.

In the blink of an eye, Ling Han had already been in the Cold Water Lake for one and a half months.

On this day, he once again came out of the lake for a breath of fresh air, but right at this moment, xiu, a stone the size of a millstone suddenly smashed over from ahead of him. This was not the end. Another stone shot over from behind him, sandwiching him between them.

This kind of attack was naturally nothing, and could be dodged with a leap through the air.

But when Ling Han leaped up, these two rocks actually seemed to have a life of their own, drawing an arc in the air as they continued to pursue him.

This had far exceeded Ling Han’s expectations. With a bang, he was instantly hit by two rocks..
