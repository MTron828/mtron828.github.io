2870 Ninth grade seals all completed

“There’s a problem now,” Ling Han said. “This dimension… Is it a part of the Genesis World?”

There was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate here. Though it was only a corpse, it did prove that there had once been a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate here, which meant that this dimension was a transcendent dimension. However, why weren’t there any historical records of this dimension?

It had been devoured by Hysteria?

Apologies, that would mean there wouldn’t be the slightest bit left of it. It would definitely not be like how it was like now.

!!

But what kind of power could destroy a transcendent dimension, then?

Could it be accomplished by a Seventh Tier?

There was a thick layer of mystery around it, and this was utterly baffling.

“This world is too big, and there is Heavenly Venerable Stone that is capable of cutting off divine sense at that. To explore it completely, it would take much, much too long,” Zhou Heng mused ruefully.

Ling Han nodded. “I plan to walk around and explore this dimension for a bit.”

“That’s good.” Zhou Heng nodded. Just cultivating behind closed doors in seclusion would not produce a Seventh Tier.

However, Ling Han still went into seclusion first, mastering the two newly obtained Heavenly Venerable Seals. In this way, the number of seals he had mastered had already reached as many as 113. Merely in terms of numbers, there were probably not many that could compare to him.

Next, he would have to think about increasing the number of Heavenly Venerable Seals. In that case, he would have to seek out Heavenly Venerable Stone mines himself.

…What raw stone lane would welcome him?

Just look at those real grandmasters of raw stone; who among them would appear in a raw stone lane? For those like Niu Buqun and Bao Fengyu, they were only second-grade characters, only understanding and comprehending partially, and had only been lucky, unlike Grandmaster Xuanlai, who was really capable of picking out treasures.

Ling Han set out with the Empress and Hu Niu. This time, Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing did not follow him.

Mainly, it was because Fu Tianxing was about to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, so Ling Xi wanted to accompany him as he traveled to various dimensions, extracting the Power of Dimension from each dimension.

Because there were not so many newly formed small worlds that were ready for “plucking,” Fu Tianxing did not walk the path that Ling Xi had taken, but rather emulated Ling Han and the Empress. As for whether he could break through his shackles, surpassing the Empress and being like Ling Han, that would have to depend on Fu Tianxing himself.

Ling Han and company set out. They had no aim, and were simply roaming the mountains and plains here, searching for fated opportunities there, as well as trying to find the lost history.

Just what exactly had destroyed this dimension? The answer could possibly have very serious implications.

As they traveled, Ling Han spread out his divine sense, searching for veins of ore. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Actually, it was easy to explore a mine. Every Heavenly Venerate was capable of that because the unique trait of Heavenly Venerable Stone was cutting off divine sense, so one only had to spread out their divine sense and see where it encountered a large-scale barrier. In the latter case, there had to be a vein of Heavenly Venerable Stone ore laid out ahead of them, or beneath the spot.

However, finding veins of ore and finding good veins of ore were completely two different matters.

There were really too many veins of ore here, but the majority of them were useless. All they contained was scrap stone. Hence, one would need a grandmaster of raw stone to assess and evaluate if this vein of ore was valuable enough to excavate and open up.

After all, even if one had great power, there would be no way to apply this great strength in something like opening a mine. One had to carefully and cautiously dig. If there really was treasure, such as a Great Herb, it could be very easily damaged.

It was even more convenient for Ling Han. With a sweep of divine sense, he could clearly see what was contained inside the vein of ore. However, the larger the vein of ore, the more time he would need.

Just like how most raw stones turned out to be scrap stones, it was the same for veins of ore. The biggest part of it would be “blank,” so it was not that easy to achieve results.

A whole 30 years later, Ling Han finally discovered a small vein of ore which contained treasure.

His speed of excavating the vein was astonishing because he knew the spots which contained treasure and the spots that contained nothing. He could completely bulldoze forward, unleashing the full power of a Heavenly Venerate. Hence, after only half a year, he had completely emptied out this vein of ore.

He obtained seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, three Great Herbs, and even more Divine Metal, almost enough to fill a Spatial Tool completely.

He gave one Heavenly Venerable Seal to the Empress and Hu Niu, respectively. The three of them had reached an agreement; Ling Han would first gather the 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals, and if he encountered any duplicates, only then would they be given to the two women.

Hence, these two seals naturally were seals that Ling Han already possessed.

Another 60-80 years passed, and Ling Han’s harvest was increasing, but it was also harder and harder to achieve results. Every force would be recruiting or nurturing their own grandmasters of raw stone, and they would be exploring and digging veins of ore all over the world, so there were fewer and fewer valuable veins of ore.

“Yi!” Ling Han showed a hint of pleasant surprise.

“What is it? Found something?” the Empress asked.

Ling Han smiled and nodded. “I really did.”

This was a vein of ore that had already been abandoned. Ling Han was simply trying his luck, yet discovered that there really was something that was contained inside this vein of ore. However, this vein of ore was huge, but there were actually just three Heavenly Venerable Seals inside. Everything else was just scrap stone. It was no wonder that it would be abandoned. They couldn’t even be bothered to excavate it.

There was no need to waste this time.

Ling Han dug out those three Heavenly Venerable Seals, and after refining and mastering them, he couldn’t help but look overjoyed.

In his mind, 111 seals were glowing at the same time, resonating with one another, and causing his Powers of Dimension to surge majestically, especially those Powers of Dimension extracted from low-level dimensions. The speed of their growth was shockingly rapid.

This was… having gathered the whole set of ninth-grade seals!

Ling Han laughed loudly. Perhaps he was the first person in the world to have gathered so many combination seals.

When the Empress and Hu Niu found out, they naturally were happy for him, and very curious as well.

“Just how much can they boost battle prowess?”

Ling Han attempted to channel these seals. Instantly, his whole body was glowing, exuding an indescribable majesty.

He threw a punch. Peng, peng, peng! Space shattered violently, and the ground was destroyed and crumbled. Even the restraints of this dimension had been opened, with endless Void Energy surging in.

This was both because the might of his punch was too terrifying, and because this dimension was dead. Without the suppression and balance from the power of heaven and earth, it was too easy to destroy it.

“222 times!” Ling Han exclaimed in pleasant surprise.

111 Heavenly Venerable Seals could increase battle prowess by 222 times after they were combined. It might seem as if every single seal had only doubled the power, which was not amazing, but it should be known that these seals originally could not be superimposed.

“Now, I am confident that I can overwhelm all other Fourth Tiers.”

Ling Han broke into a grin. If he were to battle the Highest North Heavenly Venerate and the others again now, he would not need to defeat them one at a time at all, nor would there be any need for him to use that broken saber. He would only have to confront them with a full offensive, and it would be an overwhelming victory.

‘This is just the ninth-grade seals. If I could combine all the first-grade seals, just how much could they boost my battle prowess? Furthermore, if all 999 Heavenly Venerable Seals could be combined, just how terrifying would that be?’

Ling Han was curious, and even more so expectant.

‘Would it be so violent that even my body would not be able to sustain it?’ he thought.

This was not impossible. If all the Heavenly Venerable Seals were combined, it could increase his power by 10,000, 100,000, or even more. It was absolutely normal that his body would not be able to sustain his kind of great power.

...

“Let’s continue forward.”

They began searching again, but the mountains on the surface had more or less been completely explored and searched by the various great forces. If they wanted to find any veins of ore now, they would have to go deeper underground.

Ling Han and company thus set out on this path.

They explored and searched beneath ground, and after a great many years, they actually entered a cave.

“This place was not naturally formed, but rather manually dug out. The traces are still very new,” Ling Han assessed. “Someone has surpassed us, and is now ahead of us.”
