“You people can attack together,” the sturdy man said carelessly. He was a Third Tier, and on the other side, there was a Third Tier and a Second Tier—in truth, with the gap of a cultivation level, and without a large enough number of Second Tiers, they were all trash in front of a Third Tier.

Hence, while it looked like he was fighting two people at the same time, it was actually more of a one-on-one battle.

“Ugly, you were the one who said it,” Hu Niu said.

“Make your move,” the sturdy man stated evenly, appearing to be absolutely confident.

!!

The reason why he had said so much nonsense was naturally because both Hu Niu and the Empress were too beautiful. Even if he did not have any ideas in that direction, admiring this kind of beautiful women for a while longer was still enjoyable.

Hu Niu turned, and said to the Empress, “Let’s beat him up!”

The Empress nodded. Though they frequently argued and fought, whenever they were faced with an external enemy, they naturally would join forces against this external foe.

Xiu, xiu! The two women rushed out simultaneously, blasting towards the sturdy man.

Peng, peng, peng! The two women unleashed their full battle prowess, their bodies surging with boundless light that crushed the ground all around them. Expanses of the ground crumbled, but they could not collapse at all, as they were turned into dust by their combined power.

Heavenly Venerable Seals were flickering on their bodies, greatly boosting their power.

…The Empress had a Heavenly Venerable Seal that she had created herself which was capable of boosting her power by 22 times, and though Hu Niu did not have such good luck, Ling Han had also unearthed a raw stone, giving her a seventh-grade seal which could multiply her power 24 times.

This naturally was terrifying. The two women rushed forwards, possessing the dominating aura that seemed capable of destroying everything.

The sturdy man involuntarily paled. Hu Niu’s battle prowess had already exceeded his expectations, but that was still reasonable. After all, if he was inferior in terms of Heavenly Venerable Seals, that was only a matter of luck. Furthermore, it was not like there wasn’t a chance for him to make up for the difference in the future.

But the Empress’s strength… was inconceivable.

She was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate. No matter what kind of Heavenly Venerable Seal she was using as a boost, she should not be so powerful. This battle prowess was not inferior to a Third Tier’s at all, so wasn’t it ridiculous?

He was stunned, yet he had no choice but to react. He punched out both fists, meeting the oncoming attacks from the two women.

“Don’t!” the elder in red robes hurriedly called out. He was a Fourth Tier, so he naturally could see more clearly. Hu Niu’s and the Empress’s battle prowess had both already reached the peak stage of the Third Tier. Even one of them alone was not someone that the sturdy man could handle by himself, what more when it was their combined power.

If he faced them head-on, he would only be seeking his own suffering.

Unfortunately, his words came too late. With how fast Heavenly Venerates were moving, their attacks would already be delivered with a mere thought.

Boom!

The power of the three of them clashed forcefully, causing a resounding explosion, and the sturdy man was sent flying like a cannonball. Peng, peng, peng! Originally, there had been no further path ahead of them, yet this sturdy man had forcefully opened up more of the path.

He was a Heavenly Venerate, with tough skin and a powerful body. Tempered by the fundamental powers, the body of a Heavenly Venerate was extremely durable.

The elder in red robes and his companions all turned their heads, and saw that the sturdy man had finally stopped. He was lying on the ground, head drooping, as if he was a corpse. Thankfully, he had only been knocked out from the impact. How could a Third Tier die so easily?

The elder in red robes could see very clearly; if that sturdy man had not been so careless, confronting the two head-on, he definitely would not have lost so quickly. However, he wanted to clash with force, even when his strength was not enough; in that case, there was naturally no need to wonder about the results.

The elder sneered. “You do have some strength. No wonder you dared to even look down on me. However, a Third Tier is only a Third Tier, after all. In front of me, the three of you will not be able to endure even a single finger.”

“Old geezer, then let us test the might of this finger of yours,” Hu Niu declared, clapping her hands, and looking completely naive and innocent.

“I’ll oblige you!” The elder in red robes moved. Weng, he indeed flicked out a finer. Peng, peng, peng! This passage had already been enlarged countless times with that strike previously, but the attack of a Fourth Tier was naturally even more terrifying, causing this space to again begin to collapse.

“Ling Han!” the Empress and Hu Niu called out simultaneously. At this time, it was naturally their husband’s turn to step out.

There was no need for them to call out; Ling Han had already moved. Otherwise, how could he have made it in time?

He rushed out, and was already standing in front of the two women, also tapping out a finger himself. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Boom!

The two powers clashed, instantly causing a frightening explosion. The fundamental particles here were ignited, forming a rolling wave of power which radiated in all directions.

Peng, peng, peng! The woman in purple robes and the others, along with the sturdy man who had already passed out, were all dragged into the power wave. They were instantly tossed out several dozen kilometers away.

The battle prowess of the Fourth Tier was too powerful.

“Hmm?” The elder in red robes showed a hint of surprise. He had not thought that Ling Han would actually really take this attack from him head-on.

His eyes involuntarily narrowed. This was too freakish, wasn’t it? A Second Tier was capable of matching a Fourth Tier. To say nothing of how no one else would believe this, even when he himself had seen it with his own eyes and experienced it personally, he had an abrupt feeling of absolute shock and disbelief.

If it were not for the fact that it was he himself who had attacked, he would really suspect that this Fourth Tier had deliberately held back.

“Old geezer, your finger doesn’t seem all that powerful,” Hu Niu deliberately mocked the red-robed old man. Both she and the Empress were standing behind Ling Han, so they naturally would not be affected by the shock wave.

The elder in red robes had no response to that. A Fourth Tier should be capable of completely crushing a Second and Third Tier, but the both of them had tied with this exchange of blows. What else could he say?

“Senior, since you are so willing to guide and support your juniors, why don’t you open the way ahead of us then?” Ling Han asked smilingly.

The expression of the elder in red robes darkened involuntarily. He had previously said that he wanted to protect Ling Han and his group, but actually wanted Ling Han and the others to scout out the way ahead of them. After all, approaching the core of a dimension was an extremely dangerous task.

And now Ling Han had actually turned around to demand he scouted out the way for them. This was really a turning of the wheel of fortune.

The elder’s eyes were cold. “Junior, you have thought too much!”

“Is that right?” Ling Han’s figure moved, and charged towards the elder in red robes. Since the latter was unwilling, then he would beat him into submission.

“How dare you!!” the elder in red robes shouted coldly. ‘Don’t think that you really are capable of standing against a Fourth Tier just because you possess power capable of matching Fourth Tier. These are two completely different matters.’

Weng! He channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal. This was a seal that he had developed when he had reached Fourth Tier, and he had spent about three epochs on it.

Instantly, his power soared more than a dozen times over.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and channeled a seventh-grade seal. Instantly, his power increased by over 20 times. Not only was his battle prowess not inferior to that of the elder in red robes, he had an advantage instead.

The elder in red robes was shocked. How could a guy that did not have the backing of a Sixth or Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate be capable of mastering a seventh-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal?

This was surreal.

Ling Han threw a barrage of punches, clashing with the elder in red robes head-on.

After sustaining a few blows, the elder in red robes could no longer endure it, as Ling Han punched him madly like a punching bag.

Peng, peng, peng! His figure slid backwards, as if he was further “expanding” this passageway.

The elder in red robes forced himself to stop, and had not even gotten his breath back when Ling Han attacked him again. It was another series of punches sent his way, blasting him backwards repeatedly, and opening up more of the passage.

...

Understanding finally dawned on him. Ling Han was doing this on purpose. He was using him like a human probe, testing out all the possible dangers that they might encounter on their way.

F*ck, this guy was too merciless.

The elder in red robes was fuming with fury. He was a Fourth Tier elite, and he had actually fallen to the point of being a lowly scout?

He wanted to commit murder! Aargh!

Peng!

Ling Han’s fist landed on his nose, instantly creating a stream of blood. The anger that had just arisen in him moments ago had also disappeared without a trace.
