Chapter 3624: Deal

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

The old locust tree was indeed very strong. It was a creature of Wood Element, and its natural defenses were strong. Furthermore, it had lived for as long as a thousand years. Though it could not break through to Celestial Path, in Mystery Realm Tier, it should be considered top tier.

in front of it, to say nothing of one-star geniuses, perhaps even two-star geniuses wouldn’t be able to get any advantage.

However, the problem was that Ling Han was a prodigy who had surpassed four stars.

Moreover, he had too many techniques. Heavenly Pattern Jade, Destructive Energy, Frequency Attack Attack, any one of them would be enough to elevate one’s battle prowess greatly.

Now, all of this was used by one person. How terrifying was that?

The old locust tree couldn’t hold on any longer, and broke into a run. On the treetop, those small squirrels were also squeaking, and some were even covering their eyes with their tiny paws.

This human was too terrifying. How could there be such a monster?

Shen Hanyun was also a little dazed. Ling Han had suddenly become so powerful, which was completely beyond his imagination.

However, his reaction was also very fast, and he immediately intercepted the great locust tree.

He definitely had to obtain the Thousand Year Tree Heart.

Shua, sword light swept past, and he went all out.

The old locust tree was clearly very afraid of Ling Han, and actually chose to take Shen Hanyun’s attack head-on. It was not willing to stop, and ran as fast as it could.

Pu the sword light slashed onto the old locust tree’s body. Its powerful defense was immediately displayed. This blow had left a deep mark on its body, but to its thick trunk, this deep mark was completely insignificant.

Shen Hanyun roared in fury, and slashed repeatedly with his sword, sending out a powerful attack.

“Leopard Stab!”

The Sword Qi shot out, and actually turned into a black panther that struck out at the old locust tree. However, after this strike was delivered, Shen Hanyun’s face had also become completely pale.

This move placed too much of a burden on him.

It should be known that even if he recovered to the cultivation level of Foundation Building Tier, he would only be able to use this attack a few times, what more when it was used in Mystery Realm Tier. This caused his internal organs to be boiling, and the pain was indescribable.

However, the might of this attack could not be underestimated either. The black panther was like a Primitive Age monster, and the impact actually cause the old locust tree to stumble and fall to the ground.

Ling Han caught up with him, and the Demonic Monkey Fists attacked him again.

However, this time, he didn’t use Destructive Energy.

This was already enough. Just how powerful were the repeated attacks compounded by 70 overlapping layers of power? With a single strike, the leaves of the old locust tree fell like rain, but of course, there were also fruits, which fell off one after another.

This was still quite dangerous, and possessed great destructive power. Even Ling Han had to dodge, not daring to take it head-on with his physique.

It really wasn’t worth it.

Shen Hanyun was not idle either. He continued to attack from the sidelines. With each sword strike, the might could not be underestimated, and caused considerable trouble for the great locust tree.

After several dozen moves, the large locust tree finally couldn’t hold on any longer, and was blasted into two halves.

“Zhil” The tree full of little squirrels instantly scrambled, and only after they had fled to a safe place did they turn around, glaring furiously at Ling Han and Shen Hanyun, especially that purple-coloured squirrel, whose facial expression was extraordinarily pronounced.

Shen Hanyun took a deep breath, and said, “Though I know that this is going too far, I still have to say, I need the Thousand Year Tree Heart!”

“You didn’t come for the Thousand Year Tree Heart, did you? Instead, you came for the Wood Crystal Element, right?” he paused for a moment before

continuing.

Ling Han nodded, “That’s right.”

“That makes things easier,” Shen Hanyun said. “I’ll use a Wood Element Crystal to trade with you.”

“En?” Ling Han was surprised. The other actually had a Wood Element Crystal?

Was this for real?

Shen Hanyun explained, “This is not the first time I have come to the Ironwood Forest. The last time I came, I had killed a great many Wood Element creatures, and gathered a considerable amount of essence of Wood. Added with the fact that I robbed others, there were a few people who had a considerable amount of essence of Wood on them, and I collected them all, which just happened to be enough to form a Wood Element Crystal.” Ling Han pondered for a moment, before saying, “Fine, I’ll trade.

“However, I didn’t bring the Wood Element Crystal with me. You need to go back with me,” Shen Hanyun continued.

No matter what, a trip would not need a few months’ time, so it was still worth it.

“All right,” Ling Han said with a nod. If he went back on his word, he could still make Tang Yun’er appear. With the power of the Battle Armor, this little girl was capable of matching Foundation Building Tier elites.

Shen Hanyun was overjoyed, and hurriedly went to dig out the tree heart.

The thousand-year-old locust had boundless life force, and its tree heart also had powerful life energy. It was an extremely good tonic.

Of course, this could only nourish a mortal body. Otherwise, Shen Hanyun would definitely not be the only one who had set his eyes on the thousand-year-old locust tree.

They arrived at the outskirts of the forest, and after waiting for two days, the babies returned one after another. When they found out that Ling Han had quickly obtained a Wood Element Crystal, they were all very surprised.

This father of theirs was really too lucky, wasn’t he?

To be on the safe side, Ling Han had Sixth Baby stay in the forest to safeguard the essence of Wood, so that their trip would not be wasted, and their previous efforts would not be wasted. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

One couldn’t be unguarded against others. In any case, Shen Hanyun couldn’t see Sixth Baby anyway, so it wouldn’t cause any awkwardness.

They left the Ironwood Forest, and headed towards Shen Hanyun’s hometown. Though Shen Hanyun was in the Foundation Building Tier, and had extraordinary battle prowess, he kept a very low profile, and was not very well-known.

His hometown was Zhang Clan Town, and the reason why he had done everything he could to obtain the Thousand Year Tree Heart was so that he could save someone.

“A woman?” Tang Yun’er immediately asked. She was a mischievous child. -She had been released by Ling Han when Shen Hanyun was not paying attention, acting as if she had gone out to fight Wood Element creatures like the seven toddlers.

Shen Hanyun nodded. He was a little reticent, and did not like to talk.

“You like her?” the little girl asked again.

Shen Hanyun did not answer, but a gentle expression appeared on his face.

That must be the case.

Ling Han couldn’t help but look at him in a new light. He had never thought that this quiet person would actually have a gentle side to him.

After arriving at the Zhang Clan Town, Shen Hanyun brought them to an elegant courtyard.

“Fangyue! Fangyue!” Shen Hanyun called out, but no one answered.

This courtyard was only so big. Shen Hanyun searched through the rooms one by one, and his expression couldn’t help but become cold.

He had not found her.

“Brother Ling, this is your Wood Element Crystal.” He threw a green orb filled with life energy at Ling Han. This thing had been hidden in the courtyard all

this while.

Ling Han accepted it, but didn’t examine it closely. He put it away first, then said, “Go out and find someone to ask around.”

“M-hm,” Shen Hanyun replied with a nod. He was also flustered because this matter concerned him personally..

They asked the neighbors about the situation, and soon found out the whereabouts of that Miss Fangyue.

—She had gone to the Sunken Sand Valley.

Ling Han had initially thought that Miss Fangyue had been kidnapped by some evil tyrant. Afterward, it would be Shen Hanyun showing off his might, killing the evil tyrant, and rescuing his lover. He had never imagined that she would actually enter the Sunken Sand Valley on her own.

This place was very dangerous. There were many quicksand pits, and if one accidentally stepped on them, he would immediately sink in. The sand would cover him, and there was no way he could escape alive.

Thus, it was extremely dangerous for even Mystery Realm Tiers to enter.

They hurriedly rushed to the Sunken Sand Valley. With so many people, it would be easier to find her.

The location wasn’t far, and they arrived very quickly. Then, they moved separately. There were not many people here, so if they encountered a young girl, it would definitely be Zhao Fangyue, Miss Zhao.

Ling Han walked for a while, and soon saw a woman in green sitting on a rock ahead of him..
