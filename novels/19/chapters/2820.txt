2821 Number one prodigy?

Ling Han sighed. Why did people keep doing this kind of thing?

He made some queries, and as it turned out, these were not the first people to seal off the entrance.

30,000 years ago, there were already Fourth Tier elites sealing off the entrance here, but as their disciples and descendants arrived, and were unable to pass the test after all of them had made an attempt, these Fourth Tiers left helplessly, switching to another palace to try again.

However, after this batch of people left, not many centuries passed before a different batch of Fourth Tier elites blocked the entrance. They, too, had their descendants and disciples that were making their way here.

Ling Han shook his head. There really was no end to this.

This also showed how valuable a Heavenly Venerable Seal was. If a Fourth Tier could not obtain it for themselves, they could place their hopes on their descendants and disciples. In fact, they could even forcefully extract it from them once the latter had obtained it.

With the temptation of Heavenly Venerable Seal, what could not be discarded? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In Ling Han’s heart, family was of the utmost importance, but in the eyes of the majority of Heavenly Venerates, increasing their own strength was the only thing that mattered to them.

Ling Han’s gaze wandered around. He was looking for Ping Xinghai to see if he could trick him again.

His gaze searched all around, and he couldn’t help but sigh.

Ping Xinghai wasn’t here.

…If Ping Xinghai knew about this, he would probably curse fluidly. ‘You are really hanging onto me, aren’t you?’

What to do now?

After passing two tests, and obtaining the inheritance comprising two Heavenly Venerable Seals, Ling Han was sure that he would definitely be able to obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal inside the Black Tortoise Palace, but if he couldn’t enter… then there was no need to even mention it.

He thought long and hard, but the number of Fourth Tiers that were blocking the entrance had reached as many as seven. Even if Ping Xinghai had really come, and Ling Han had managed to successfully trick him into doing the same thing again, the chances of his being able to sneak in through the chaos would’ve been close to zero.

Moreover, would Ping Xinghai be tricked again after falling for Ling Han’s trick before?

He was not that stupid.

Ling Han decided he’d just wait and see.

Ling Han sat down at one side. He would definitely not give up the chance of obtaining this Heavenly Venerable Seal.

As he sat, another two years passed.

In this period, a great many people had come and left. Some veterans left helplessly, and some rookies, relying on their master and clan background, wanted to approach to ask for mercy, but they were all refused, and no one could enter into the palace.

A thought suddenly flashed in Ling Han’s mind, and his eyes snapped open abruptly.

Here was another person.

This was a mighty figure, a frightening aura exuding from him, turning into flames that unfurled around him.

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. This was someone familiar.

Zhuang Feirui.

When a Heavenly Venerable Seal had appeared, even if some people got the news later than others, as long as they got wind of the news, they would definitely come to take a look.

Close to 1,000,000 years had passed, and Zhuang Feirui’s aura had become more stable and frightening. Clearly, his battle prowess had improved considerably.

He was a naturally gifted prodigy. In the past, he was known as the strongest prodigy. It was only afterwards, when he was trapped in the second spatial level, that everyone thought he had died, and with the abrupt appearance of people like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu, he was gradually forgotten.

However, his strength could not be denied. At present, he was definitely an overlord among Fourth Tiers, and there were few that could match him.

As he headed straight for the entrance of the palace, it seemed like there was lightning flashing with every step he took.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. This was an opportunity.

He moved quietly and very carefully because once Zhuang Feirui discovered his presence, the latter would definitely turn around to suppress him first.

“Stop, my friend!” A Fourth Tier stretched out his hand and pressed downwards.

“Scram!” Zhuang Feirui was extremely domineering. Within Fourth Tier, there was no need for him to pay anyone any regard. If he didn’t like the looks of them, he would move directly. He was invincible.

“You have gone too far,” another Fourth Tier said.

“If you guys don’t scram, I’ll send you flying!” Zhuang Feirui moved directly, charging towards those seven Fourth Tier elites.

“How dare you!!” Those seven Fourth Tiers all humphed angrily. ‘You are too arrogant, aren’t you?’

Being able to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, which of them was not a gifted prodigy? There was already no such thing as differences between king tiers and monarch tiers. If their cultivation level was completely equal, battle prowess should be equal as well.

‘Isn’t fighting against seven all alone just asking for a beating?’

The seven Fourth Tier elites all humphed coldly, and moved to suppress Zhuang Feirui.

Peng, peng, peng! The eight of them fought intensely, and what caused everyone’s jaws to drop in absolute shock and astonishment was that not only had Zhuang Feirui not fallen into a disadvantage, he had an absolute upper hand.

‘Impossible!’

Everyone was dumbfounded. Seven Fourth Tiers, all of them at peak-stage Fourth Tier at that, combined their efforts, and actually were no match for a single Fourth Tier?

It should be known that Zhuang Feirui was only a middle-stage Fourth Tier at best, and it was possible that he had not attained that level yet. How could he be so strong?

“This is a supreme prodigy!” someone exclaimed shakily.

“Who is this guy?”

“He, you guys don’t even know who he is? Zhuang Feirui, the number one prodigy of several epochs ago!”

“What? It’s actually him? Why did I hear that he had died a long time ago?”

“That’s right. I also heard that he had died.”

“Died? He had only been a Third Tier then, but he had been trapped for several epochs in a danger zone of the Realm Battlefield. Not only had he not died, he had even advanced further, and stepped into the Fourth Tier.”

“Hiss, that is too amazing.”

“Of course, as expected of the number one prodigy.”

Everyone was exclaiming in shock, and amidst their surprised exclamations, Zhuang Feirui was also defeating those seven Fourth Tiers in a clean sweep.

...

Gathering several dozen Powers of Dimension when he had been a First Tier was an advantage that would be eternally maintained by any First Tier. However, the higher the cultivation level, the further this advantage would be considerably weakened.

It could not be helped. Aside from Ling Han, others would only consolidate their Power of Dimensions into a core, which had limited growth.

Zhuang Feirui swept his eyes over his surroundings, appearing insufferably arrogant.

He had the right to do that because he was the number one prodigy, who was unmatched among his equals. Who would be able to match him?

‘Show off,’ Ling Han inwardly said. This guy had probably forgotten how he had been harshly thrashed by Ling Han in a battle of equal cultivation levels, hadn’t he?

However, without the suppression of cultivation level, Zhuang Feirui was indeed overwhelmingly strong. Without anyone at or above the Fifth Tier, who would be capable of suppressing him?

Xiu! A figure entered from the entrance, revealing an extremely beautiful and graceful outline. This was an exquisite beauty. Even if everyone here were Heavenly Venerates, they still had their breaths taken away upon their first glimpse of her.

Yet Ling Han’s eyes narrowed. This was shockingly that mysterious woman from the White Tiger Palace, who had been inconceivably strong.

…She had already obtained the inheritance of the Azure Dragon Palace?

She definitely had, or it was impossible that she would have taken so much time to make it here.

This exquisite beauty walked gracefully and elegantly. She seemed to be walking lightly and extremely relaxedly, but her speed was considerably fast. Very soon, she drew near to the doors of the palace.

...

“En?” Zhuang Feirui glanced over, revealing a hint of displeasure.

He did very much admire this beauty’s exquisite appearance, but didn’t she know the rule “first come, first served”? He had just overthrown those “bullies” blocking the doorway, and she simply wanted to come and reap the benefits without saying a word?

Zhuang Feirui stretched out his arm to stop her. “Friend, don’t you think that you should ask me for my opinion first?”

That mysterious woman’s steps paused momentarily. “An ancient historical site is not something that belongs to anyone, so why do I need to ask permission from you?”

Zhuang Feirui’s eyes sharpened. “Friend, you have gone too far!” He had always been the overbearing type. Even if this woman was incomparably beautiful, so what? If she went against his will, he would mercilessly suppress her anyway.

This was a chance!

Ling Han moved silently. He, for one, knew that this mysterious woman was extremely powerful. At the very least, she would not be weaker than Zhuang Feirui. If the two of them started to battle, that would be the best chance for him to slip into the palace.

That exquisite beauty ignored Zhuang Feirui completely, and walked delicately and gracefully, continuing on her way.
