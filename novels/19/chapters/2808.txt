2809 A frightening deduction

Ling Han turned around. “Damn dog, you seem to have become even fatter.”

“Grandpa Dog is slender!” The large black dog immediately walked over on his hind legs, and placed a paw on Ling Han’s shoulder. “I heard that you are being hunted now?”

“Hehe, a good deed goes unnoticed, but a scandal spreads fast.” Ling Han shook his head.

“Brat, you are already very lucky. Grandpa Dog has heard that there are many that share the same predicament, and who knows how many prodigies there are that have disappeared!” the large black dog said.

!!

“Are there so many?” Ling Han raised a brow.

“Really!” the large black dog said seriously. “It is said that there are quite a few that are even the descendants of Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, and they have just disappeared into thin air, never seen alive or dead. Say, if they even dare to make a move on the descendants of Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, what would they dare not to do?”

Ling Han nodded slowly. “Is there any other serious matter?”

“Yes. Now that we’re not fighting with Hysteria, we are fighting among ourselves… Actually, it can’t really be considered ourselves. After all, even for those coming from the same dimension, it is very hard to consider them united, either.” The large black dog shook his head. “Going by Grandpa Dog’s deductions, this world is even more chaotic than previously.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel a sudden chill. “Say, would this be the true purpose behind the eruption of the energy storm this time?”

“Are you saying that Hysteria has deliberately created this energy storm so that we would start killing one another?” the large black dog responded, and then shook his head. “That’s not right, either. The Two Realm Passageway is already destroyed now, and only Seventh Tiers can battle within. This is something that has been confirmed by all the powerful figures.

“Otherwise, everyone would not be so stupid.”

Ling Han pondered for a moment. “You are right. However, we are not Hysteria. We are all ordinary living beings, but aside from being a living being, Hysteria is also a dimension at the same time.”

“You mean that Hysteria would have some way to dissipate the energy storm?” The large black dog inhaled sharply. “Hiss, then we would be in deep trouble!”

“We are all fighting among ourselves, expending our military strength, yet Hysteria can create armies as much as it likes. By then, with that side stronger and our side weaker, the consequences would be unthinkable!”

“However, if the situation had been allowed to progress like it had, there would have ultimately come a day when the Flaming Frost Realm would have been devoured, so why would it have needed to expend extra effort to do something unnecessary?”

The large black dog couldn’t figure it out.

Ling Han thought for a moment. He continued, “We are not Hysteria, and there is no way we can figure out its true thoughts. However… we can make some deductions of our own. Going by the previous tempo, it is possible that Hysteria would devour the Flaming Frost Realm, but there is one problem.

“The Genesis World is trying to save itself, and has sparked off Realm Wars. in other words, transcendent dimensions could come into being as one high-level dimension devours another and is devoured in turn.

“Even if the Flaming Frost Realm is gone, there could still be a second transcendent dimension, and the war would continue.

“The Genesis World would grow and multiply without end. As long as there is enough time, new dimensions could continuously come into being, and in this manner, there will never be an end to the war.

“Moreover, who can guarantee that there wouldn’t be a second Hysteria?”

The large black dog nodded repeatedly, and thought that Ling Han’s words were reasonable. They were unable to calm the energy storm, but it did not mean Hysteria definitely had no way to do so, because it was one of the main culprits behind the creation of the energy storm.

“If this energy storm has been deliberately caused by Hysteria…” Ling Han continued with his deduction. “Then, the most terrible situation has already happened. Without the threat of survival, we are already starting to fight among ourselves.”

“The prerequisite condition would be that Hysteria really has a way to calm the energy storm. Otherwise, all these deductions could not possibly eventuate,” the large black dog said.

“Go and find the black donkey, and have him ask Senior Zhou Heng,” Ling Han said. There was an unknown number of high-level Heavenly Venerates eyeing Ling Han now, so revealing himself publicly would be too dangerous.

The large black dog nodded, and was just about to turn and leave when he immediately stopped again, and exclaimed, “That’s right. Grandpa Dog almost forgot about the real business!”

“What real business?”

“Lord Yuan Sheng has discovered the tomb of an ancient Heavenly Venerate from historical records. It is extremely possible that there is a Heavenly Venerable Seal within!” The large black dog revealed a shocking piece of news.

“Hm?” Ling Han’s eyes brightened. “Are you sure that is reliable?”

Celestial Kings were already immortal, what more Heavenly Venerates? How would they die?

The large black dog nodded. “That was a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate. A great problem came up when he had been attempting to break through to the Sixth Tier, and that was what caused his death. There are a great many historical records that can verify this. But this Heavenly Venerate did not have any children or disciples, so no one knew where he was buried.

“That is until the energy storm that has recently risen. It has even affected various places in the Flaming Frost Realm, and only then has his burial spot finally seen the light of day again.”

Ling Han thought for a moment. “Going by that theory, we wouldn’t be the only ones that would be eyeing this tomb, then?”

“There should be quite a number.” The large black dog nodded. “Thus, Lord Yuan Sheng wanted to find help. Originally, Grandpa Dog had wanted to find your son. However, since you are back now, Grandpa Dog is inviting you directly.”

“Sure,” Ling Han agreed decisively. “You go and find the black donkey first.”

The large black dog left immediately, and returned not many days later. Ling Han had only talked about this possibility to the large black donkey, and told him to pass on the message to Zhou Heng. As for whether Zhou Heng accepted it or otherwise, that would definitely not be known for the moment.

Ling Han beckoned his son over as well. Ling Jianxue was presently in the martial academy. He wanted to be a good teacher, and frequently taught disciples there.

The group set out, meeting up with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and they set out towards the tomb of that ancient Heavenly Venerate.

As Ling Han traveled, he couldn’t help but feel rueful. This energy storm had really had tremendous effects on the Flaming Frost Realm. A considerable number of inconceivable terrain shapes and forms had appeared here. There were mountains that were hanging upside down and oceans in the skies, completely rebelling against logic.

Among their group, there were Ling Han, the Empress, Ling Jianxue, Hu Niu, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the large black dog, which counted for six Heavenly Venerates. The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had just advanced to the Second Tier. Hence, they had the battle prowess of one Third Tier Heavenly Venerate and three Second Tier Heavenly Venerates, which was already considered an acceptably strong team.

But considering that there would definitely be Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates making their move, and even Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate could appear, they did not dare to be too careless. They all deliberately kept a low profile, advancing towards their destination.

Several months later, they arrived.

Originally, it would not have taken so much time at all. However, because of the impact caused by the energy storm, the space in the Flaming Frost Realm was completely chaotic. If one just rashly advanced in a single direction, he would very likely realize that he was heading in the wrong direction altogether.

After every section of their journey, they would have to stop to check if they were still advancing in the right direction. Hence, this very much affected the efficiency of their journey, causing what had originally been a journey of several days to take as long as several months.

This kind of effect would definitely disappear slowly, but it might take several hundreds of millions, or even tens of billions of years.

Originally, this had been a massive plateau, but now it had become a sea of flames. Flames surged into the skies, but if one flew into the sky, they would be able to see that the other side of the ocean of flames was a boundless territory of ice, with snow flying for thousands of kilometers, filled with icy coldness.

Where the sea of fire and the ice plain met, there was a colossal gulf that looked like a massive mouth. This gulf was still continuously widening, as if a great mouth was opening, striking chills into everyone who saw it.

However, there was a brilliant light that was soaring from within the gulf, exuding an incredibly majestic air. This was definitely of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.
