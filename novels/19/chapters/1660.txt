Chapter 1661: Great River Tribes

All the elites of the two tribes were numb with shock. They felt a strong coldness stream through their bodies, making them feel as if they were close to passing out. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Was this guy really human?

Being simultaneously attacked by about 40 Nine Rings elites, he was actually completely unscathed!

The ancestral teachings said that the person who could use green light was the Destroyer, but their ancestors must have not seen the complete twists of fate—it was not the green-light-user himself that brought destruction, but rather the man that was with him!

Ling Han strode over, his black clothes fluttering in the breeze, yet his expression was filled with killing intent.

He had never killed mindlessly, but when others had already offended him, it naturally was illogical for him to still be merciful and kind.

“Outsider, do you want to make an enemy of all the Great River Tribes?” the Lang Tribe chief asked coldly, his expression seemingly very calm, but anyone could hear that sliver of shakiness in his tone.

This kind of strength had far surpassed his imagination, and there was not the slightest chance for him to be a match for him.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Your words are incorrect! It should be your Great River Tribes that want to make an enemy of me, right? If that’s the case, then I will just erase you all with a single hand!”

How domineering!

In the distance, both the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint looked excited. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden even wanted to throw herself into Ling Han’s arms.

Even if the whole world was standing in my way, I would still charge bravely forwards!

“Our Great River Tribes have existed for who knows how many millions and millions of years, how could they be erased with a single declaration from an outsider like you?” the Zhao Tribe chief also exclaimed loudly. At this time, their imposing manner definitely could not be weak.

What they represented was not only the Zhao Tribe and the Lang Tribe, but all the Great River Tribes. They could not lose their backbone.

Ling Han turned and asked, “Xiao Gu, why do the words ‘the Great River Tribes’ make me feel especially disgusted?”

Xiao Gu slanted its head to one side, and called out “yiyaya”, but felt that it did not express enough, so it began to imitate his words. “Xiao Gu, why do the words ‘the Great River Tribes’...”

Just how much was he looking down on them?

Saying it once was not enough, and they actually repeated the same words a second time!

The elites of the two tribes all wore cold expressions. The Great River Tribes had the unyielding character of the Great River Tribes, and definitely would not surrender because their enemies were too strong. In their ancestral teachings, there was only suicide after being defeated in battle; there was no such thing as surrendering.

“Ninth, Eleventh, Seventeenth, when the battle starts later, you three circle around the battle towards those two over there and capture them to threaten this outsider,” the Zhao Tribe chief communicated through divine sense.

His eyes very obscurely swept over the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint. If they could use these two people to threaten Ling Han to surrender, that naturally was the best scenario. Even if they couldn’t, they would still be able to force him to retreat. If he was not willing to do even this, then they would just have those two people die alongside them.

“Yes!” The three peak stage Nine Rings elites nodded.

The Lang Tribe chief also issued a similar command. This was the only hope they saw of turning the situation around.

“You actually dare insult our grand Great River Tribes, all of you have, to, die!” The Lang Tribe chief roared loudly, and led all the elites of the Lang Tribe against Ling Han in an offensive with a wave of his hand.

The Zhao Tribe did not hold back, either. All their elites also charged forwards.

Actually, they all knew that this kind of attack was ineffective on Ling Han. Their purpose was only to allow the few sneak attackers to secretly sneak to Ling Han’s rear and capture the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint amidst the chaos of battle.

Ling Han very casually flicked his fingers. Pa, pa, pa, pa. Every flick produced a flash of Sword Qi, and there would be one person’s head that would explode every time, his spirit and form eliminated simultaneously.

“Ah!” The elites of the two tribes all released furious shouts. All these were Nine Rings elites, and were the accumulated strength of the two tribes through countless years, yet now? They were all killed like they were helpless vegetables on the cutting block.

But they were also very helpless. They could only use even more human lives to fill their gap so they could cover for the sneak attackers on their side.

Very soon, they broke into smiles because there were four people who had circled around to Ling Han’s rear—though there were also two that had been unfortunately killed—and victory was close!

“Charge!” The four elites moved, charging towards the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Notionless Saint. They pounced over from four different directions to seal off all routes of escape that the two of them could take as much as possible.

Boom, the frightening attack was earth-shattering. This was the battle prowess of peak stage Saint King-level.

Ling Han used Lightning Flash. Xiu, he had already appeared behind a sneak attacker. He tapped out a finger, and pa, that person’s head immediately exploded, and he became a headless corpse. With another move, he had caught up to the second sneak attacker, and did the same thing. That person was also killed.

Then, it was the third, and finally Ling Han had caught up with the fourth sneak attacker. His hand grabbed the latter’s neck, and lifted him up.

At this time, the fourth sneak attacker was only about nine meters away from the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden!

The elites of the two tribes only saw a blur before their eyes before they noticed three elites had been killed and fallen onto the ground, while the last was held in Ling Han’s grip.

“So this is the pride of your Great River Tribes? Fearing a head-on battle, and thus resort to such vile sneak attacks?” Ling Han scoffed. With a toss of his right hand, he threw the sneak attacker in his grasp towards the elites of the two tribes. “I’m giving you back!”

A few elites were about to stretch out their hands to catch the person when they heard the Lang Tribe chief exclaim, “Dodge quickly!”

It was too late!

A ball of light appeared from within the body of that sneak attacker. Pa, it suddenly exploded, and burst into innumerable flashes of sword light. Xiu, xiu, xiu. The sword light filled the skies like a violent storm with howling winds and torrential rain, and killed a large portion of the elites of the two tribes in an instant.

Those that were still alive were only the chiefs of the two tribes and three to four people, but all of them were covered with injuries, and were a tragic sight.

“D-demon!” The Zhao Tribe chief pointed at Ling Han, his expression filled with great hatred.

“I am not a demon, I am simply defending myself. Who asked you all to be so aggressive?” Ling Han raised his hand again, and a few more flashes of sword light slashed out. Pa, pa, pa, pa. The remaining elites were also killed instantly.

“Yiyaya!” Xiao Gu was very unhappy. Why didn’t he leave a few behind for it?

Ling Han smiled. He looked at Xiao Gu, but even if he had advanced into the Great Saint Tier, and was already invincible in the Ancient Realm, he still could not see through Xiao Gu.

This guy’s power was definitely not limited to the strength that it currently showed, but rather far surpassed it. However, it seemed as if that frightening power had been sealed off, and could not be freely used.

“Let’s go ransack them!”

The four of them first headed to the Zhao Tribe, and then went to the Lang Tribe, sweeping all the treasures that the two tribes had accumulated over countless millions of years into their pockets.

Ling Han was still not very satisfied, because there were only five Saintly medicines in total.

“Don’t be greedy. Even Forbidden Lands only have two to three Saintly medicines,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said smilingly.

Ling Han nodded his head, and wrapping his arm around the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s slender waist with a smile, he said, “Feng’er, we can be considered to have successfully accomplished our goal. Should we have a kiss, and work hard on having a kid?”

“Go to hell!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden spat. No matter how long she and Ling Han had been married for, she was still as bashful as she had always been.

And Ling Han was only teasing her. They hadn’t found the Empress and the others, so how could he possibly be in a mood to do anything else?

They passed through the Lang Tribe, and continued their advance.

“Come on, let’s go back,” Long Yushan said to Long Xiangyue softly in the distance.

Long Xiangyue looked at Ling Han’s receding back dumbly. She had a feeling that this might be their eternal parting.
