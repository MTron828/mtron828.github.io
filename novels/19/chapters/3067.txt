3068 A Stunning Turn of Events

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ling Han was undoubtedly the main force in the battle against Hysteria.

“Piss off!” he roared as his body lit up. He channeled all of his third-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals, causing his power to increase 6000-fold. Even Hysteria was unable to withstand his furious attack, and its tentacle was forcefully sent flying.

When Ling Han finished unleashing his explosive power, Hysteria had already been pushed back 350,000 kilometers.

The seven ultimate elites were all beside themselves with excitement. After fighting Hysteria for so many years, it had only ever been them who had been forced to retreat by Hysteria. They had never once managed to hold their ground.

But now?

They were pushing Hysteria back!

This was the first time in history! This caused them to shake with excitement, so much so that even their heads went numb.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were also people; they also had emotions.

Ling Han channeled his fourth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals. Even though his power increase fell down to only 5000-fold, this was still enough for him to ferociously charge forward and continuously force Hysteria back.

This time, Hysteria was forced to retread 250,000 kilometers.

Ling Han then channeled his fifth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals.

The combination seals all started to circulate together, smashing into Hysteria and forcing it to retreat more than 1,000,000 kilometers. This was a stunning feat, a historical feat.

After unleashing his explosive power, Ling Han stood still and asked in a calm voice, “Still want to continue?”

Hysteria waved its tentacles around. Its situation was unique, and the fact that it had transformed into a dimension allowed it to become far more powerful than normal. However, this also caused it to lose some abilities, such as channeling Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Before today, this hadn’t been an issue at all. One could only channel Heavenly Venerable Seals for a limited amount of time, and it further took a great deal of time for one to recharge the energy of the seals. Meanwhile, Hysteria possessed a crushing advantage over the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates, so it didn’t matter even if it couldn’t channel Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Now, however, Ling Han’s raw power was already able to rival it. That being the case, it became extremely critical whether it could channel Heavenly Venerable Seals or not.

If this continued, it would be pushed back time and time again, all the way until it was forced from the Two Realm Battlefield.

At that time, it would be Ling Han who charged into its dimension, preventing it from waging another war against the transcendent dimension.

“Impossible! You can’t be this powerful!” Hysteria roared in a booming voice. “Unless… you obtained the secret of the world!”

‘Secret of the world?

‘Secret code of life?’

Ling Han’s heart jolted. The World’s Core was most likely a non-existent manner. This was something that “Extermination” had made up to trick him, Chong Yan, and the others. Now, however, Hysteria was mentioning some secret of the world?

Ling Han’s unfathomable power came from the ball of light in his mind. Theoretically speaking, this was a secret that could never be discovered—one could never discover the ball of light in their own mind. In fact, one could only discover it if they managed to resonate with another person. In other words, it was essentially impossible.

However, due to a string of coincidences, Ling Han had indeed discovered this secret and unlocked this ability.

“Yes, that’s definitely the case!” Hysteria exclaimed, its emotions fluctuating and agitated. “Who would’ve thought? After planning for countless years, it was actually snatched away by you first!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Is this so-called ‘secret of the world’ the mysterious ball of light in one’s mind?” Ling Han asked.

“That’s right. This ball of light contains the secret of the Genesis World’s origin, and obtaining it will allow me to charge through the barrier and leap out of this small pond,” Hysteria replied.

Lin Luo and the others couldn’t help but feel astonished upon hearing this. Leap out of this small pond?

What did this mean?

“What lies beyond this small pond?” Ling Han asked. He recalled the time when Hysteria had disdainfully called him a “frog at the bottom of a well,” This caused his mind to wander, and he speculated whether more Genesis Worlds lay in the void.

Now that Hysteria was actively mentioning it, Ling Han naturally had to seize the opportunity to ask. Otherwise, it would be much harder to extract this information from Hysteria when it eventually calmed down.

“Perhaps it’s a bigger world, or perhaps it’s a vast expanse of void,” Hysteria replied.

‘Even Hysteria doesn’t know?’

Ling Han smiled, and asked, “You’re willing to destroy the Genesis World for the sake of this unknown?”

“So what if I am?” Hysteria replied unsympathetically. “Since I know there’s a chance for a more spectacular world to lie beyond this small pond, why would I want to be trapped in this place forever? Even if it’s nothing more than a dark cage, how can I be willing to give up if I don’t at least take a look for myself?”

Ling Han fully understood the situation now. Hysteria was naturally engulfing the dimensions to increase its own power. At the same time, however, it was also aiming to engulf those who had a ball of light in their minds. Once Hysteria engulfed these beings, the secrets that were contained inside the balls of light would also be obtained by it.

After so many years, it was very likely that Hysteria had already obtained some secret codes of life. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to create Sixth Tier monsters.

However, Hysteria also had its own limitations. After transforming into a dimension, its base power was indeed much higher than anyone else. However, this also restricted it from creating any more dimensions. Instead, it could only continue to strengthen its own dimension.

Qualitatively speaking, this kind of growth was superior to that of anything else. However, Ling Han could completely rely on an advantage in quantity to suppress or even surpass this.

Hysteria was unable to rival Ling Han even after toiling for so many years?

This was only normal. After all, becoming a dimension had indeed strengthened Hysteria. At the same time, however, it had also placed a pair of shackles on it, preventing it from moving around as it pleased.

Meanwhile, Ling Han was truly blessed by fortune, first encountering Wally and then taking in a disciple who was similar to himself. This allowed him to finally discover the secrets of his own body, secrets that should have never been revealed.

“Everyone should have curiosity in their minds. However, I can’t allow countless people to die simply to satisfy your thirst for an answer to your curiosity!” Ling Han announced. He dashed forward and started to pummel Hysteria again.

In the past, he had always been suppressed and pushed back by Hysteria. This had caused him to be filled with frustration. Now, it was finally his turn to return the favor.

He ferociously launched an attack. However, without the explosive power of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, he was in fact unable to suppress Hysteria. Even with the help of Lin Luo and the others, he was only able to reach a stalemate with Hysteria. After all, Hysteria was far too powerful.

Every once in a while, however, when the Heavenly Venerable Seals finished recharging, Ling Han would be able to unleash explosive power and forcefully push Hysteria back.

Even though this was a slow process, Lin Luo and the other ultimate elites were still filled with uncontrollable excitement.

This was because if this continued, there would eventually come a day when Hysteria was finally ejected from the Profound Negative Realm. At that time, they would only need to stand guard at the entrance and never need to worry about Hysteria invading them again.

“Hmm?”

“Huh?”

In the midst of their intense battle, Ling Han, Lin Luo, and the others suddenly felt several powerful auras rapidly dashing over.

In the next moment, Chong Yan and the four other ultimate elites from the previous era appeared before them. Beside them were Ten Thousand Shadows and the other Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates.

Had they come over to provide “help” now that victory was within reach? Were they doing this to leave a good name for themselves in the history books?

They were truly skilled at taking advantage of the situation.

However, before they could even finish these thoughts, they saw the seven ultimate elites furiously charge over, their targets being… Lin Luo and the others.

Peng, peng, peng!

This was a completely unexpected turn of events, and Lin Luo and the others were immediately sent flying after being caught off guard.

Fortunately, those at the Seventh Tier were indestructible and undying. Thus, they were uninjured even though they were sent flying.

“Chong Yan, Golden Silk Moth, have you two gone crazy?” Xin Fu roared in a harsh voice.

What in the world were they doing? Were they helping Hysteria?!

Chong Yan and the others didn’t answer. Instead, they continued to unleash attacks to draw the attention of Lin Luo and the others.

However, Ling Han was the main force among them, so Hysteria would have no option but to retreat as long as he continued to unleash the might of his Heavenly Venerable Seals. This would remain the case even with the additional annoyance of Chong Yan and the others.

Boom!

A supremely powerful aura swept over them, after which a slender and elegant figure materialized. It was as if they had strode over from the ancient past, and they brought with them a devastating power as they launched a strike at Ling Han.

Extermination.
