Chapter 1766: Separation Resentment City

Ling Han headed toward Separation Resentment City with Mao Dai.

Separation Resentment City was where the Fu Clan was located, and Mao Dai had initially planned on joining the Fu Clan after reaching the fourth severance. However, after witnessing Ling Han’s incredible power, he didn’t have any interest in remaining in Dark Moon City anymore.

He wanted to join the Fu Clan as soon as possible so that he could continue to grow stronger.

If one didn’t have a flying treasure, then the fastest way to travel around the Celestial Realm would be by ship. After all, Transfer Formations were far too expensive and far too difficult to construct.

Ling Han couldn’t help but click his tongue in wonder. As it turned out, the large black dog could also be viewed as a “talented dog”.

Anyhow, he would leave the people from the Great Ling Empire in this smaller city of the Black Moon Sect. He couldn’t look after them forever, so now was a good time for them to gain independence and learn to live by themselves.

This was the Celestial Realm, and there was no such thing as heaven or hell in this realm.

“Do they truly not exist?” Ling Han asked Small Tower.

“Most definitely not!” Small Tower answered with absolute certainty.

At this moment, Ling Han was filled with great anticipation. After arriving at the Fu Clan, he could start to ask around for the Roc Palace’s whereabouts. At that time, he would then be able to set off and look for his friends.

After sailing for almost a year, the ship finally arrived at Separation Resentment City.

This was an unfathomably large Three-Star City that was divided into four regions—Heaven Departing City, Separation Reluctance City, Great King City, and Minor King City. Heaven Departing City was the city of the highest level, and only the Fu Clan and their subordinate forces were allowed to reside in it.

Separation Reluctance City also housed the subordinate forces of the Fu Clan, but these forces were far weaker than those in Heaven Departing City. Moreover, their relationship with the Fu Clan was also relatively inferior.

Meanwhile, Great King City and Minor King City both housed ordinary residents. However, Great King City was slightly higher in level. After all, ordinary residents were also divided into different social classes.

Mao Dai was followed by Zhang Chong and Mao Shuyu, while Ling Han was accompanied by the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. The six of them settled down in Minor King City before sending someone to report their arrival.

Of the four cities, only Minor King City could be entered with a payment of Star Stones. Meanwhile, the three other cities all required explicit permission before one could enter. If one were to enter without permission... the guards of the Fu Clan weren’t standing around for show.

After waiting for a few days, Ling Han and the others finally received permission to enter Heaven Departing City.

The four cities of Separation Resentment City were organized in a top-down manner, with Heaven Departing City naturally situated at the topmost location. In fact, one would need to enter a Transfer Formation to reach this city. Because the distance wasn’t too great, the cost of constructing and maintaining this Transfer Formation was also relatively acceptable. Otherwise, perhaps only Celestial King Tier forces would be able to shoulder the costs of maintaining a Transfer Formation between two Three-Star Cities.

After arriving here, Mao Dai bade farewell to Ling Han.

Although Mao Dai was a prodigy, he was far inferior when compared to Ling Han. Thus, the two of them received extremely different treatment when being recruited by the Fu Clan.

One day later, Fu Gaoyun excitedly ran over to visit Ling Han.

“Brother Ling, you’ve finally come!” He immediately rushed over to give Ling Han a friendly and enthusiastic hug.

Ling Han smiled upon seeing Fu Gaoyun. He was an extremely enthusiastic person, and this was in stark contrast to those who were less skilled in expressing themselves. A good example of this was the Empress, who would definitely kill any stranger who dared to embrace her.

Anyhow, Fu Gaoyun hadn’t let Ling Han down, and he had helped him purchase a huge amount of Godly metal. Meanwhile, Ling Han had also seen a huge increase in his wealth recently. In fact, he had obtained almost half of the Ding Clan’s accumulated wealth.

Why half?

This was because he had left Dark Moon City, meaning that he couldn’t obtain the Ding Clan’s fixed assets. For example, he couldn’t obtain the Ding Clan’s precious mines. As such, the Long Clan and the Duan Clan had given him most of the liquid assets.

That being the case, Ling Han had almost 100,000,000 Star Stones at this moment. Judging from this, one could also see just how wealthy these powerful forces were.

Moreover, the Ding Clan was only a Severing Mundane Tier clan.

Ling Han was about to repay Fu Gaoyun with Star Stones, yet Fu Gaoyun didn’t care about this at all. After all, he had bought the Godly metal on credit. As the future clan leader of the Fu Clan, who dared to press him for repayment?

“Brother, if you still didn’t come, Elder Yan would soon explode,” Fu Gaoyun said. This was another reason why he had rushed over so quickly. He needed to take Ling Han to visit Xiang Yan as soon as possible. Otherwise, this great alchemist might directly wreak havoc in the Fu Clan.

Ling Han laughed heartily upon hearing this, and he followed Fu Gaoyun to visit Xiang Yan.

He naturally brought his newly received Spatial God Tool to the Fu Clan as well, and after passing through a stone gate, he arrived before a courtyard. Upon entering this courtyard, he saw that in addition to Xiang Yan, there was also a white-haired elder as well as a beautiful young woman. This woman was truly beautiful. She had a slender body, smooth and jade-like skin, and glossy raven-black hair.

However, Fu Gaoyun immediately grimaced upon seeing this young woman. It was as if he wanted to immediately turn around and leave.

“Hey, Little Yun Yun!” the beautiful young woman exclaimed upon seeing Fu Gaoyun. She wasn’t reserved at all, and she seemed even bolder and more straightforward than men. “Why do you always run away when you see me? It’s not like I’ll stick a rod through your a*s or anything.”

This... Upon hearing this, Ling Han immediately understood why Fu Gaoyun was wearing such a sulky expression. This young woman was far too bold.

The white-haired elder shook with anger, and shouted, “Young lady, why don’t you act like a proper woman at all?!”

He was Situ Tang, and he had finally come to visit today after being pressed by Xiang Yan several times.

Meanwhile, that bold young woman was his only granddaughter. She was called Situ Xiaozhen, and because her parents had died early, she was Situ Tang’s only remaining relative. As such, she was extremely spoiled and pampered by him. However, it was also because of this that she had grown to become the bold woman that she was today. This frustrated him to no end.

Situ Xiaozhen replied with a simple “aha”. She didn’t dare to publicly retort her grandpa. However, even though she obediently listened to his critiques, she would never end up changing her ways. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Fu Gaoyun stepped forward and respectfully bowed to the two great alchemists. “My respects to Elder Yan and Elder Tang!”

These were the two most high-ranking alchemists of the Fu Clan, and they were also the greatest assets of the Fu Clan. Thus, they deserved the respect of everyone in the Fu Clan.

The two alchemists replied with a smile. Xiang Yan then grinned widely as he walked up to Ling Han, saying, “Brat, you’ve finally come. Come over here, let me see if your alchemy has improved or not.”

“Old Geezer Yan, why did you drag me over here,” Situ Tang said in irritation. “I’m extremely busy, and I don’t have time to bullsh*t around with you.”

Ling Han couldn’t help but grimace. He finally understood where Situ Xiaozhen had learned her habits from.

Meanwhile, Situ Xiaozhen was glancing at Ling Han in curiosity. She had seen Xiang Yan many times, yet she had never seen him acting so warm and friendly with anyone before.

Xiang Yan humphed before disdainfully saying, “Old Geezer Tang, I suggest that you stop wasting your time on the Winds and Fires Nine Clouds Pill.”

“What? You dare to say that I’m wasting my time?” Situ Tang immediately jumped up, continuing, “You’re the one wasting your time! Your entire family is wasting their time! Just you wait! I’ll definitely refine the Winds and Fires Nine Clouds Pill in under 10,000 years!”

“Heh!” Xiang Yan chuckled coldly as he tossed a vial toward Situ Tang. He was wearing an apathetic expression, yet he was already jumping around and dancing in joy in his mind.

Situ Tang instinctively caught the vial, and he irritatedly asked, “What’s this for?”

“Open it and see for yourself!” Xiang Yan replied with a wave of his hand.

“How pretentious!” Situ Tang said with a scoff. He casually opened the vial, yet his expression instantly underwent a drastic change. This was because he could already smell the fragrance of the alchemical pill.

He shuddered upon smelling this, and he immediately exclaimed, “Winds and Fires Nine Clouds Pill!”
