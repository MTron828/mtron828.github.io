Chapter 1748: Fu Gaoyun

The white-robed young man hurriedly moved to pull back the tune. Otherwise, if it was known to others that he, Fu Gaoyun, was actually playing the Descending Lotus Flowers, how would he still have the face to see other people in the future?

However, though Ling Han’s playing was completely out of order, the rhythm was filled with a strong ability to influence others, and Fu Gaoyun could not pull the tune back to its original path no matter how hard he tried.

Weng, weng, weng. Dang, dang, dang.

At first, the sound of the qin was still struggling, but it yielded very soon, and was led by Ling Han’s tune to play a song of Descending Lotus Flowers.

Peng!

Fu Gaoyun smashed his qin in his fury. He could not control his hands at all. If he continued playing, he would go crazy.

Ling Han laughed, and asked, “So what is this considered now?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He did not know music, but his spirit was strong, and a competition of music was actually a match of spirits. The one who was stronger could influence the other, and it was clear that Fu Gaoyun was no match for him.

Even if the latter was already a second severance elite.

Fu Gaoyun gritted his teeth, and exclaimed, “I don’t care anymore, I want to beat you up first!” He couldn’t bear it any longer. He, the most outstanding prodigy of the Fu Clan, had actually played half a song of Descending Lotus Flowers. In the future, he really did not have any face to see others.

He proudly declared, “If you can block three moves from me, I’ll consider you awesome.”

Hong, he only pointed a finger, but this small movement caused the weather to change suddenly. That was clearly just a single finger, yet it was wrapped with multiple bands of golden light, as if it had become the highest grade of Celestial Tool in this world, and moved to suppress Ling Han.

Ling Han similarly pointed a finger, and smilingly asked, “What is so difficult about that?”

Weng, an indescribably coldness diffused out. So what if he was a second severance? He would still be frozen to death!

Ka, ka, ka. The golden finger that Fu Gaoyun had shot out was immediately frozen in ice, and shattered with the violent impact caused by Ling Han’s power crashing into it. Yet this finger of Ling Han did not seem to have weakened in the slightest, and was still continuing onwards to strike at Fu Gaoyun.

Fu Gaoyun looked astonished. He was a second severance!

This brat was too extraordinary!

Fu Gaoyun issued a battle cry, and released his full power. With a shake of his hands, two long swords appeared in his grasp, and he slashed out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was unarmed. The strength of his present physique was comparable to Two-Star Pseudo-Divine Metal. Even a third severance would find it difficult to wound him, and he was strong enough to stand against a second severance who wielded a Pseudo-Celestial Tool.

The swords in Fu Gaoyun’s hands were indeed Pseudo-Celestial Tools, and they were of Two-Star level. Their sharpness, sturdiness, and power were tremendous. Even an ordinary second severance elite would find it hard to avoid being sliced in two if he was struck by this weapon.

But facing Ling Han, this was still not enough to overcome him.

The two of them battled fiercely, and for the moment, it was actually hard to decide who was stronger between the two of them.

Fu Gaoyun was stunned. He had formed 10,000,000 stars in the Eternal River Tier, and advanced into Severing Mundane Tier on this basis. Furthermore, he had achieved a flawless severance. He should have been invincible in this cultivation level.

But a guy that had just advanced into the first severance was actually capable of confronting him head-on? Hiss! Then if this guy had reached the peak stage of the first severance, wouldn’t he be able to easily suppress him?

...Fu Gaoyun was presently in the late stage of the second severance. With another step, he would reach the peak stage of the second severance, so how could it be as wide a gap as for Ling Han who would need to advance from the early stage of the first severance to the peak stage?

Just what kind of freak was this!

“You, you are a Severing Mundane Tier that struck the heaven and earth!” He immediately realized. Otherwise, there would definitely not be a guy whose battle prowess was so freakish in this world.

Ling Han chuckled, and asked, “Are the three moves over?”

Fu Gaoyun stopped, and said, “Forget it. You are practically a freak, I don’t even have the slightest confidence that I can win.” Though he spoke of not having the slightest confidence of victory, he was still considerably confident in himself.

That was because not being able to win did not mean that he could not kill him. There were some secret techniques that would hurt yourself if used, but you would be able to obliterate your foe with a single strike.

This was only a test. He naturally would not need to use such a deadly move.

Moreover, there were in fact only three stages. He had only come here to show off and strut around because he was bored.

“Come, come, come, let’s go and have a drink.” Fu Gaoyun walked over and slung an arm around Ling Han’s shoulders, appearing to be very affectionate. This displeased the Empress, and she immediately sent out a palm strike.

“Yi!” Fu Gaoyun exclaimed in surprise, and exchanged blows with the Empress in close quarters. The two of them sent out palm strikes and switched hands while their bodies remained still. They had already exchanged a few thousand moves in that short time of a few breaths.

The Empress was at a slight disadvantage, but it was not like she was completely outmatched.

“F***!” Fu Gaoyun’s eyes bulged. The Empress was definitely also a Severing Mundane Tier that had struck the heaven and earth. Otherwise, how was a first severance any match for a second severance? Furthermore, if it was not for the fact that she was only in the early stage of the first severance, her battle prowess would definitely not be inferior to his if she had reached the late stage of the first severance, which meant that she was only a minor level inferior to him.

He was about to cry. Just think: he, Fu Gaoyun, was an outstanding prodigy of the Fu Clan. Though he was not very famous, that was because the Fu Clan was protecting him. Fu Gaoyun was considerably proud of himself. Aside from not being able to advance into the Severing Mundane Tier by striking the heaven and earth, his path of cultivation could be considered perfect.

But now? He had received a heavy blow to his pride.

Two freaks that had struck the heaven and earth had appeared in close succession. In front of these two people, how could he have the face to call himself a prodigy?

“My name is Fu Gaoyun. Brother, how should I address you?” Fu Gaoyun appeared to be very carefree, and did not have the airs that a young master of a noble clan should have at all.

“Ling Han. This is my wife, Luan Xing,” Ling Han introduced.

Fu Gaoyun nodded, but did not venture to hook an arm around Ling Han’s shoulders again. He said, “Brother Ling, come, come, come. I am impressed by your battle prowess. However, I must correct your horrible taste in music!”

He was still brooding very much on the matter. How could this guy abuse music like this?

Every single person had their hobby, and Fu Gaoyun’s hobby was playing the qin and xiao[1]. What he could not bear to see the most was an idiot in the aspect of music. Thus, when he decided to befriend Ling Han, he was also resolute to improve Ling Han’s standards of playing music.

Ling Han chuckled. Aside from cultivation and martial arts, his only other interest was alchemy. He did not have the slightest interest in music.

‘So let’s see who would be leading who astray.’

As long as Fu Gaoyun did not go and “fool around” with Ling Han, the Empress would not move, either. The three of them descended the mountain, and Ling Han drew the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden out of the Black Tower. It was inevitable that he had to introduce her to Fu Gaoyun.

Fu Gaoyun called Ling Han brother on the surface, yet addressed the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden as younger sister-in-law. His intention to consider himself as the big brother was absolutely clear.

“Yi, brother, why did you come down with them?” Fu Xiaoyun had already arrived at the other side of the foot of the mountain to receive those people that had successfully passed the test, and when she saw Fu Gaoyun walking alongside Ling Han and his group, she couldn’t help but look surprised.

In her impression, this brother of hers was very proud, and no one was worth his attention. Yet now, he was actually chatting amiably with Ling Han. This was too exaggerated.

Fu Gaoyun smiled, and said, “This is my close brother; I naturally have to accompany him!”

‘Close brother?

‘Just how long have you known each other? And you are already close brothers?’

Bei Xuanming was watching from the sidelines, and he involuntarily showed a hint of jealousy. That was because he had once deliberately fawned on this future brother-in-law of his to win his favor, but the latter did not even spare him a look.

‘It’s fine if he was just proud, but he actually deigned to be on such good terms with this kind of lowly commoner? Isn’t this a deliberate slap right into my face?’

“Ling Han, I wish to battle you once more!” Just at this moment, Xiao Sheng called out loudly.
