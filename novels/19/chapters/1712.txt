Chapter 1713: Kicked around like a ball

Everyone felt very repressed and furious.

Though not everyone here was a disciple of the Black Moon Sect, whether it was Dark Moon City or Double Extreme City, they were all under the administration of Black Moon City. If the Black Moon Sect was insulted, how could they possibly feel proud?

Furthermore, Xiao Sheng was indeed too despicable.

Firstly, he had not won in an honorable manner, but had rather made use of the limit of three moves that Changsun Liang had promised. Secondly, Changsun Liang had been injured in the first place, so how could defeating a king tier that was not in his best condition count?

Anyone could step out, and give this arrogant guy a beating!

But even Changsun Liang could only fight Xiao Sheng to a tie in his prime condition, so was there anyone else that could give him a harsh thrashing?

“Hahahaha, Brother Tie, looks like this Holy Son of your sect has not cultivated enough!” Xiao Dong laughed loudly, adding fuel to the fire without the slightest mercy. He broke into a cold smirk. That last blow that Xiao Sheng had followed up with was really too brilliant, having directly wounded Changsun Liang severely.

With that, it was highly possible that he would have to recuperate his injuries for two to three years, and would definitely miss the opening of the Severing Mundane Pool.

For a prodigy like him, he would definitely choose to advance into Celestial level at the Severing Mundane Pool, and once he missed that opportunity, that would mean waiting another 10,000,000 years.

Which also meant that Xiao Sheng could gain a lead of 10,000,000 years over him.

Even in the Celestial Realm, this was also a very long time, enough for Xiao Sheng to become an elite in the consummate level of Dividing Soul Tier first, and raze the Black Moon Sect to the ground.

The sect master of the Black Moon Sect wore a livid expression. However, because his whole body was entwined with Regulations, no one could see his current expression clearly.

“Since no one from your sect is going to fight, I will take my leave first.” Xiao Dong beckoned Xiao Sheng over. Now that they had finished their display of superior might, it was time for them to leave.

“Wait!”

Just at this moment, a soft exclamation rang out. A young man slowly and casually walked out, his face bearing a faint smile. “I will take up the challenge!”

It was Ling Han!

Looking at the stage, everyone showed an expression of excitement. Previously, they had already heard that Ling Han had battled with Changsun Liang before, and their battle had ended in a stalemate. Furthermore, the fact that Changsun Liang had been injured was also because of his previous spar with Ling Han. They had never thought that things would be so coincidental, and they would encounter another super genius today.

However, since Ling Han had shared the limelight in the previous battle with Changsun Liang, then with Changsun Liang having sustained injury, Ling Han should not be exempted, either.

This battle... was still very dangerous.

“You?” Xiao Sheng cast a look at Ling Han, and showed a hint of disdain in his expression. “Who do you think you are? Are you even worthy of challenging me?”

He had defeated Changsun Liang, and had already become the new ruler of the young generation. How could any random person just challenge him?

If any random person could challenge him as they liked, then wouldn’t he die of exhaustion?

Ling Han did not get angry. In any case, he just had to beat him as hard as he could later. He smiled, and said, “Previously, wasn’t it you who said that anyone who is dissatisfied can challenge you, and there is no limit on numbers, either?”

“Oh, aside from you, who else is dissatisfied?” Xiao Sheng asked coldly.

Ling Han turned around, and asked the Empress, “Wife, are you satisfied?”

“Dissatisfied,” the Empress spoke up, her tone filled with assertiveness.

Even if it was not to give face to Ling Han, the Empress would also feel dissatisfied. She was prouder than anyone else.

“You see, the two of us are dissatisfied, so how about we beat you up together?” Ling Han was all smiles, as if he was saying something like let’s have a meal together today, appearing to be very casual.

A fury immediately surged up in Xiao Sheng. Why was this guy so detestable? It was only a few words, and he was already infuriated to the extreme. He swept an eye over the Empress, and this rage rapidly disappeared into thin air.

Such elegant bearing, how captivating!

He immediately decided: even if he had to snatch, he would have to bring this woman back to Hundred Magnificence City.

With such thoughts, he said, “All right, then the two of you can fight me together.”

Ling Han snickered, and slowly circled around to stand behind Xiao Sheng. In this way, he, Xiao Sheng, and the Empress would be the three points of a triangle. He laughed, and said, “Wife, let’s kick this guy around like a ball.”

“All right!” The Empress nodded. Though her philosophy was much simpler, preferring directly killing whoever made her unhappy, since Ling Han wanted to play around, she would also be happy to oblige him.

Xiao Sheng’s expression involuntarily became very ugly. Just how far did the two of them look down on him? Actually wanting to trap him in between the two of them and kick him around like a ball?

Was this combining their forces against him?

Absolutely not. It was just you kicking it over, and I kick it back. There was practically no difference from a one-on-one duel.

...For those that had reached heights like they had, they actually did not fear having to fight a few battles in succession. Their Origin Power was like an ocean, and their vitality was vibrant, so even if they had to fight for a few decades, they would not feel exhaustion.

“What a despicable mouth! Let’s see if I wont’ rip it apart!” He flew into a thunderous rage, and immediately leaped out, charging out towards Ling Han.

“Wife, catch the ball!” Seeing that Xiao Sheng had reached him, Ling Han threw out a punch.

Peng, without a doubt, Xiao Sheng was sent flying by his fist.

With Ling Han’s present strength, even if the Empress and Changsun Liang joined forces, they were no match for him, so what was merely Xiao Sheng worth all by himself? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“...” The sect master of the Black Moon Sect.

“...” Xiao Dong.

“...” Changsun Liang.

“...” All the spectators.

F***! This... Had their eyes blurred? Xiao Sheng was actually sent flying with such a casual punch!

It could be confirmed that this blow from Ling Han had definitely not made use of any kind of celestial technique. There were no patterns of great dao, and there was no light of Regulations. If this was a celestial technique, then it was definitely one that had never been seen before.

It was just a very simple, ordinary punch, and Xiao Sheng had flown off... flown off just like that!

Who could have imagined this? Who would believe it?

Had Changsun Liang really fought him to a tie? Hiss, could it be that it was not Xiao Sheng that was strong, but rather Changsun Liang’s injuries were too severe, and Xiao Sheng had taken advantage of his weakness today?

Otherwise... it would mean that Ling Han had not used his full strength at that time at all!

Those who were the most in disbelief were the people from Dark Moon City. They knew that Ling Han was very strong, but it was only just now that they had found out that Ling Han actually managed to battle Changsun Liang to a tie. But looking at Ling Han’s show of power now, they were directly dumbfounded.

Was this really human?

Xiu, Xiao Sheng streaked through the air, flying directly at the Empress.

Though Xiao Sheng had been dazed by that punch, a king tier was still a king tier, after all. Seeing how a person had suddenly appeared in front of him, he immediately threw out a punch first, wanting to take the initiative.

The Empress moved, and her slender, fair hand was a beautiful sight to behold, but the power of her palm strike was incredibly deep and resounding. As she delivered a palm strike, endless patterns of great dao were compressed, practically enough to scare anyone to death.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. Xiao Sheng and the Empress engaged in a fierce exchange, and his strength was visible from this as well. He actually managed to block more than 30 moves from the Empress, and only then was he sent flying with a palm strike from the Empress, crashing back towards Ling Han again.

‘You guys are really treating me like a ball!!’

Xiao Sheng was furious. With a loud shout, taking advantage of the fact that he was still in mid-air, he used the blade of flame. This was one of his strongest attacks. If one was slashed once by the flaming blade, he would suffer a Dao injury, and it was extremely fatal.

Ling Han smiled, and stretched out his hand to grab the flaming blade.

At first, Xiao Sheng had wanted to stab him with the fiery blade, but when he saw that Ling Han had stretched out a hand to grab at his blade, he naturally would not dodge, either. Thus, Ling Han’s hand steadily and firmly grabbed the fiery blade.

“Not good!” Changsun Liang involuntarily paled. It was because he had taken a strike from this fiery blade of Xiao Sheng at the end, causing shards of the Regulations of Fire to fill his entire body, and merge into one inside his body. They were very difficult to expel.
