3078 Engulfing the World

To sacrifice a dimension, a transcendent-level dimension… Even Ling Han would be reluctant to do this if he only had a set number of dimensions.

Extermination was truly a resolute and ruthless person.

“Ancestor, I was wrong!” Wang Quanhe cried. He tried to unleash his Seventh Tier power to fight against Extermination, yet the gulf between them was far too great. Before Extermination, he was like a newborn chick standing in front of a vicious old eagle. He couldn’t resist at all.

Ling Han wanted to charge over, yet Extermination simply launched a palm strike at Wang Quanhe. Ling Han wildly vomited blood, and he was instantly stopped cold in his tracks.

This so-called Blood Murder Technique was definitely no ordinary secret technique. Instead, this was most likely a secret technique that pertained to the secret of the Genesis World.

Ling Han was powerless to do anything. Extermination had paid such a heavy price to gain this advantage, so how could it be something that was easy to resolve?

“Are you not going to hurry up and finish your job?” Extermination roared at Hysteria.

Hysteria glared at her for a moment. This was its body from the previous era, yet it couldn’t help but feel extremely distant and unfamiliar with it at this moment.

Just what kind of being was Hysteria? It was naturally ticked off at being ordered around like this. However, it still suppressed its anger.

Once it engulfed the Celestial Realm, the power of the entire Genesis World would flow into its body. At that time, it would become the most powerful being in the world. It would be able to suppress and kill anyone it wanted.

‘Very well, I’ll let you enjoy your arrogance for a while longer.’

Hysteria flew toward the Celestial Realm. It had only formed a temporary alliance with Extermination, and it naturally wouldn’t tolerate someone being more powerful than it and ordering it around.

Ling Han wanted to stop Hysteria, yet he couldn’t move his body at all. Extermination simply needed to strike Wang Quanhe, and this would immediately cause him to suffer severe wounds. His face was as white as a sheet.

He was definitely more durable than Wang Quanhe, and he wouldn’t be killed even if Wang Quanhe was killed by Extermination. The problem was, Extermination simply needed to obstruct him and give Hysteria enough time to engulf the final dimension.

What about Lin Luo and the others?

They were completely powerless to do anything!

So, what could they do now?

Even though Ling Han had already advanced to the Seventh Tier, gaining peerless power, he was still unable to prevent the worst-case scenario from playing out?

Lin Luo and the others dearly wished that this was nothing more than a nightmare that they would wake up from. However, Hysteria had already wrapped its tentacles around the Celestial Realm, and started to engulf it again.

With its insane speed, it would only need a maximum of 10 years to destroy the Celestial Realm.

10 years…

Could Ling Han turn the tables in such a short amount of time?

Looking at the current situation, Ling Han was completely suppressed by the Blood Murder Technique and unable to break free.

The key to everything was Wang Quanhe.

Lin Luo and the others were all brimming with killing intent. If they could kill Wang Quanhe, then Ling Han would also be set free.

‘Die!’

Lin Luo and the others charged at Extermination. However, Chong Yan and the others were no pushovers, so with them in the way, only four of them managed to arrive before Extermination.

“Here to seek death?” Extermination asked in amusement as she unleashed a palm strike.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The four people were immediately sent flying, vomiting blood as they crashed through the air.

Extermination was no match for Ling Han, yet she possessed an absolute advantage over the other Seventh Tier elites. None of them could withstand a single strike from her. To say nothing to four Seventh Tier elites, even 10 Seventh Tier elites would make no difference if they charged up to her.

“Hahahaha!” Extermination roared with laughter. Her long hair billowed in the wind, and her slender body swayed slightly. She appeared as breathtaking and seductive as could be.

Her victory… was already set in stone!

One month, six months, 12 months…

Lin Luo and the others were powerless as they watched the Celestial Realm rapidly shrink piece by piece. Meanwhile, Hysteria was seemingly undergoing some kind of transformation as well.

To gather the power of the entire Genesis World into one body… Just what kind of qualitative change would this lead to?

Ling Han was still unable to stand up. Even though Wang Quanhe had already been dismembered by Extermination, just how powerful was a Seventh Tier elite’s life force? Thus, he didn’t die even though he had suffered such severe wounds.

In fact, Seventh Tier elites couldn’t even commit suicide.

Three years, five years, eight years!

The Celestial Realm was already in its death throes. Meanwhile, the initially pitch-black Hysteria surprisingly started to transform as well.

It first turned white, before turning silver, and then finally toward gold. It transformed slowly, and it was very likely that it would become completely golden once it finished engulfing the Celestial Realm.

Nine years, nine years and a half!

The Celestial Realm was about to expose its core. It was also at this moment that Wang Quanhe was finally tortured to death by Extermination. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were indeed undying, but this was also dependent on the situation. For example, Yellow Sand and the Extermination’s previous self had both been killed by the destructive power of the Genesis World of the previous era. Now that Extermination’s strength had also reached a similar level, it was only natural that she was able to kill a Seventh Tier elite as well.

“Arghhh…!” Wang Quanhe wailed in agony as his soul floated out of his body which had already been completely obliterated.

Lin Luo and the others didn’t feel a shred of sympathy. He had chosen this fate himself. After all, who told him to side with Extermination and Hysteria?

Scheming with sinister individuals would naturally lead to a wretched death.

“Now for the final strike!” Extermination said as she jabbed her slender finger at Wang Quanhe’s divine sense.

Comparatively speaking, the divine senses of Seventh Tier elites were far weaker than their physical bodies.

Pa!

Wang Quanhe’s divine sense was instantly obliterated.

He was as dead as dead could be.

“Aaah!” Ling Han clasped his head in agony. Under the influence of the Blood Murder Technique, it was as if a blade had been violently plunged into his divine sense. This caused a splitting pain to engulf his head.

In the next instant, however, he had already dashed forward.

His target was none other than Hysteria!

He had to stop it. There was almost no time remaining.

Now that Wang Quanhe had died, Ling Han had no time to worry about whether he should feel sympathy or apathy toward this extreme descendant.

Ling Han charged over and threw a furious punch.

Weng!

Like waves in a pond, golden light rippled across Hysteria’s body.

The power of Ling Han’s strike was completely dissipated over Hysteria’s colossal body, reducing its destructive power by countless times. As such, it was completely unable to wound Hysteria.

Meanwhile, Hysteria didn’t waste any time as it continued to ravenously engulf the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han roared and threw another punch.

Peng!

Extermination dashed over in a timely manner, blocking his strike with her palm. Even though she was sent flying, her interference still succeeded in blocking most of Ling Han’s power.

Hysteria faced this attack head-on as it watched the Celestial Realm collapse completely. The core of the dimension flew out, and it was as if it wanted to engage in a final struggle.

However, the entire Celestial Realm was already surrounded by Hysteria, so how could the core of the dimension escape?

Hysteria widened its maws and swallowed the core.

“Spit it out!” Ling Han roared as he furiously attacked Hysteria.

Peng, peng, peng!

He unleashed countless attacks at this instant, causing Hysteria’s golden body to shudder violently.

Whoosh!

Hysteria counterattacked, using a tentacle to whip Ling Han’s fist.

Weng!

A devastating power rippled through the air, blasting Ling Han back. Meanwhile, Hysteria’s tentacle also bounced back slightly.

This exchange… had ended in a draw.

Gasp!

After engulfing the final dimension and obtaining the power of the entire Genesis World, Hysteria’s power had also grown to an unfathomable level.

One had to realize that it was unable to channel the Heavenly Venerable Seals; it was only able to wield its raw power. Yet, it was still powerful enough to rival Ling Han, who had already increased his power 100,0000-fold. Just how insanely powerful had it become?

There was no dispute that it was the most powerful being in the world!

“Hahahahaha!” Hysteria roared with laughter. Its strength was still increasing, and the power of the Genesis World was still boundlessly gathering. This was an infinite power that made it feel as if everything was within its grasp.
