Chapter 2627: Hunted

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han and the Empress became increasingly interested in the Ancient Tomb. There was a Heavenly Venerate Technique hidden in this place, and this was more so one that they could practice straight away. Thus, this had great significance.

They ventured deeper and deeper, and news of two people being outsiders who had come here to train also started to spread like wildfire.

“Outsiders!” Several days later, Ling Han and the Empress came across people who were hunting them.

This was a group of three Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings. Their expressions were baleful, and their eyes were filled with killing intent.

They detested outsiders the most. These were people who treated them as stepping stones.

Ling Han stood still, sweeping his gaze over them. He involuntarily smiled, and said, “Just you three? That’s nowhere near enough!”

“Impudence!” the three people roared as they attacked in unison.

The Empress drew her sword.

Swoosh!

She was at the Fifth Heaven now, so combined with the might of her Celestial Tool, her battle prowess had already reached the peak stage of the Seventh Heaven.

This slash was incredibly terrifying!

The three Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings were deeply astonished, hurriedly spreading apart to dodge this attack. They then launched a counterattack of their own.

Spiritual attack!

Weng!

Three bursts of devastating spiritual attacks surged over, causing the Empress to involuntarily humph. An expression of pain spread across her delicate face.

The gulf in cultivation level between them was far too great, so this kind of spiritual attack was extremely effective against her. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Miao Yingwei hadn’t unleashed this secret technique before, and this was because he had only just entered the Ancient Tomb. As such, he hadn’t been affected by the black energy yet, so he hadn’t been able to master this secret technique.

However, these three people were different. They had entered the Ancient Tomb long ago, so not only had they been affected by the black energy for a long time, but they had even killed numerous Celestial Kings and absorbed their black energy as well. This caused their spiritual attacks to become even more destructive.

“You’re nothing but a measly Fifth Heaven Celestial King!” the three Celestial Kings sneered. They pressed their advantage, aiming to defeat the Empress in a single breath.

Their eyes were filled with greed and lust. This was because the Empress owned a Celestial Tool.

However, the Empress remained unfazed as she continued to dance around, her sword stabbing and slashing like the falling rain. Borrowing the might of her Celestial Tool, her ferocity was such that the three Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings didn’t dare to near her. Otherwise, if they got too close, they might be wounded by the Celestial Tool at any time.

However, they simply needed to maintain a safe distance as they unleashed their spiritual attacks. This way, they could still suppress the Empress.

Ling Han sighed, saying, “Three Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings attacking a Fifth Heaven Celestial King. Have you people no shame?”

“Brother Li, go and kill that brat!” a Seventh Heaven Celestial King in a purple robe said.

“Sure thing!” the Celestial King in black said with a nod. He turned around to charge at Ling Han. This man surnamed Li refused to believe that Ling Han was also this freakish, being able to rival Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings while at the Fifth Heaven.

Meanwhile, the Celestial King in purple and the Celestial King in green continued to attack the Empress. They believed that she was the stronger of the two, and thus she deserved the attention of two of them.

“Immediately surrender and hand over your Celestial Tool! That way, we can spare your life!” the Celestial King in purple said. His eyes were gleaming with greed. Not only did he want the Celestial Tool, but he also wanted to obtain this stunning beauty.

The Empress didn’t reply, instead continuing to brandish her sword. She couldn’t be bothered responding to these foul insects.

“You two… seem to have forgotten about me…” Ling Han said in a slow and calm voice.

‘What? That brat still isn’t dead?’

The Celestial King in purple and the Celestial King in green looked over in unison. However, they instantly gasped, even stopping their attacks.

The Celestial King in black had already collapsed to the ground, a gaping hole in his chest. Blood flowed from this wound, and his life force had already been extinguished.

If this were in the outside world, heaven and earth would grieve the death of a Celestial King. Thus, it would be as obvious as could be. Here, however, the death of Celestial Kings would be accompanied by no such honor. Their lives were as worthless as cats and dogs.

‘Gasp! This is far too quick, no?!’

A Seventh Heaven Celestial King being defeated by a Fifth Heaven Celestial King was already unfathomable. To be killed in such a short amount of time was even more inconceivable. That was a Seventh Heaven Celestial King! If he were intent on fleeing, even newly advanced Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be unable to stop him!

Just what kind of trump card had this brat used? If not for one, they couldn’t accept this at all.

“Come, which of you wants to be my next opponent? We’ll fight one-on-one to ensure some fairness,” Ling Han said with a faint smile.

The Celestial King in purple stepped forward, immediately unleashing a spiritual attack as he did so. Only then did he say, “I’ll fight you!”

Weng!

The spiritual attack arrived, and Ling Han couldn’t help but frown. He felt like a needle had stabbed into his mind.

This had happened numerous times already, yet there was still nothing that he could do about it. This kind of attack ignored distance, so it was almost impossible to defend.

However, these attacks didn’t affect Ling Han much, either. He had already mastered the Divine Sense Scroll of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, so this amount of pain couldn’t affect him. His mind was boundless and flawless.

“It’s disrespectful to receive but not give. Here, eat my punch!” Ling Han said as he charged forward, throwing a punch at the Celestial King in purple.

The Celestial King in purple humphed as he replied with a punch of his own.

He was unafraid as long as Ling Han didn’t use his trump card. In his mind, Ling Han had definitely used some kind of rare Ninth Heaven treasure to kill the Celestial King in black. Otherwise, how could a measly Fifth Heaven Celestial King possibly be so powerful?

Peng!

Their fists collided, instantly releasing a shock wave that spread into the surroundings. After faltering for a brief moment, the fist of the Celestial King in purple instantly shattered. A magnificent force continued to surge forth, causing his arm to also explode, and sending bits of shredded flesh into the sky and exposing his white bones.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Only when his entire arm exploded into pieces did the magnificent force finally subside. The entire right arm of the Celestial King in purple had already disappeared, with blood still spurting from his shoulder.

The Celestial King in green was transfixed with terror upon seeing this. F*ck! This person had obliterated the arm of a Seventh Heaven Celestial King with a single punch! Just how devastating was his destructive ability?

“Y-you… How can you possibly be so powerful?” the Celestial King in purple stammered. He finally understood how the Celestial King in black had been killed so quickly. It wasn’t that this person possessed a deadly weapon or whatnot. Instead, he was the deadly weapon!

“Cultivate earnestly in your next life, then you’ll know,” Ling Han said as he dashed forward and threw another punch.

They were far too close, so it was impossible for the Celestial King in purple to dodge. He could only grit his teeth and throw a punch with his left hand.

Peng!

To no one’s surprise, his left arm was also obliterated in an instant, turning him into an armless person.

This wasn’t a big deal for Celestial Kings. They all possessed flourishing vitality, so it was extremely easy to regrow broken limbs. The problem, however, was that the Celestial King in purple had no time to do so as Ling Han’s third punch soared over.

The Celestial King in purple raised his left leg to block.

Pa!

His left leg was also obliterated, transforming him into a one-legged person.

He didn’t dare to block any more attacks. Hopping on his single remaining leg, he immediately turned around to flee.

Heavens! This Fifth Heaven Celestial King was far too terrifying! This wasn’t someone he could kill!

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “You still want to flee? It’s already too late!”

If the Celestial King in purple had turned around to flee immediately after coming across Ling Han, it would have been extremely difficult for Ling Han to stop him even if he activated the Regulations of Space. Now that they were so close, however, it was truly a joke that the Celestial King in purple still thought that he could escape.

Ling Han caught up to him in an instant, directly throwing a punch.

Pu!

The Celestial King in purple violently vomited blood as he stumbled forward. Slowly looking down, he saw that a gaping, bloody hole had already appeared in his chest, with his heart completely obliterated.

He then looked up at Ling Han, disbelief in his eyes.

As a mighty Seventh Heaven elite, he was actually killed just like this?

With this thought in mind, he crashed heavily to the ground, throwing up a cloud of dust.
