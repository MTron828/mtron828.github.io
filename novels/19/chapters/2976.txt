2977 Fragments

Ling Han’s eyes instantly narrowed. That was… Jue Huo!

Who would have thought that she would suddenly appear at this time after disappearing for so many years?

She was obviously already a Seventh Tier, so what was the point of seeking a dimensional core?

Seventh Tier, the pinnacle of the world. Even if she were to obtain the most precious thing in the world, it would be impossible for her to advance any further.

Hysteria was so impressive and awesome because it was too unique, having manifested as a dimension, which was why it had the ability to suppress Seventh Tier elites. Even if others wanted to give up their living bodies and become a dimension as well, it would be impossible.

What was a Seventh Tier fighting for the dimensional core for?

However, such a move by Jue Huo immediately made her a target.

All the Seventh Tiers, including Hysteria, attacked her.

Even though Jue Huo, being a Seventh Tier, was immortal and indestructible, when faced with attacks from so many Seventh Tiers, she could only be sent flying. However, the force of her grab had already shot out, smashing into the dimension core. Peng, how astonishing was the strength of a Seventh Tier? Without the protection of a dimension, the dimension core appeared incomparably fragile, exploding with a single strike.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Countless fragments shot out in all directions. Some were as big as fists, while others were smaller than grains of rice.

This scene was extremely unexpected, but it only took an instant for everyone to fly out and chase after the core fragments.

“What, it’s you!” When Chong Yan and the other Seventh Tiers of the older generation looked at Jue Huo, all of them revealed shocked expressions.

For Seventh Tier ultimate elites, so what if the heavens collapsed and the earth split apart, or the universe was destroyed? They were indestructible and immortal, so they would always remain calm and collected. Even if Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s doppelganger had been destroyed by Ling Han, there would only be boundless anger.

But now, the five ultimate elites all looked as if they had seen a ghost. This was too rare.

“Extermination!” they cried out in disbelief.

What?!

Ling Han was flying out in pursuit of a dimensional core fragment, but when he heard these five people’s exclamations, he almost stumbled and fell.

Jue Huo… was Extermination?

Was this possible?

If Jue Huo was Extermination, then what was the present Hysteria? And if Jue Huo was not Extermination, would all five Seventh Tier ultimate elites recognize the wrong person at the same time?

Boom! Jue Huo didn’t reply. She only responded with a terrifying attack.

Loud explosions rang out one after another, and Ling Han couldn’t hear anything.

He could naturally charge back and listen to the following conversation, but how could he have the time to do so now?

In just an instant, Ling Han put aside his curiosity, and continued to chase after the dimensional core fragment that had bounced away in front of him. He had to race against time. There were simply too many competitors here. As long as he slowed down a bit, it was guaranteed that he would not be able to obtain anything.

Chase!

Ling Han’s speed was extremely high, but that core fragment had been sent flying by a Seventh Tier, and its initial speed far surpassed his. In an instant, it had already disappeared from his field of vision, leaving Ling Han with no choice but to chase after it by following the trajectory of its flight.

Behind him, the battle among Seventh Tier ultimate elites was currently unfolding with great vigor, and for the time being, no one had the time to spare.

Ling Han traveled for half a day before the dimension core fragment finally appeared in front of him. It was only the size of a fist, and its light radiated brilliantly in the vacuum, making it very conspicuous.

Obviously, its speed had slowed down. Otherwise, how could Ling Han possibly catch up to it?

Just a little more.

Ling Han continued to give chase. He was only about nine meters away when, shua, a dark whip-like shadow suddenly whisked towards him.

This was Hysteria’s doppelganger!

“Humph, I’m not afraid of you now!” Ling Han said calmly as he clenched his fist and punched out towards his opponent.

In the past, he had encountered Hysteria’s doppelganger several times, and he had fled in a miserable state each time. However, now that his battle prowess was already at the peak stage of Sixth Tier, he naturally had nothing to fear.

Peng! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Han punched at the whip-like shadow, and a terrifying power instantly rebounded back, causing his body to pause for a moment. However, Hysteria’s tentacle was also trembling violently, and was similarly in a tough situation.

Ling Han took a deep breath. After all, this was Hysteria. Even if it was just a doppelganger, it was no weaker than him.

“Let’s fight!” His fighting spirit surged. After so many years of cultivation, he finally no longer had to fear Hysteria—even if it was just one of its doppelgangers.

Peng, peng, peng. He was engaged in a fierce battle with Hysteria’s tentacle. All seventh-grade seals were being channeled. He had to kill Hysteria’s doppelganger as soon as possible and snatch the dimensional core fragment. Otherwise, who knew what would happen?

Ling Han went all out, and with the enhancement of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, his strength instantly soared by 2,000 times, and the dimensions in his body were all released, reaching as many as about 1,000. Such battle prowess was truly terrifying, and he was definitely the number one below the Seventh Tier.

Facing such a powerful Ling Han, even Hysteria was no match for him. This doppelganger was quickly destroyed.

Ling Han put away the dimensions and stopped channeling the Heavenly Venerable Seals. He once again started to chase after the dimension core fragment.

‘Hmm?’

He quickly caught sight of another person chasing over from a certain distance on the side, and his target was the core fragment ahead of him.

A competitor?

Ling Han was unafraid. As long as one wasn’t a Seventh Tier, no one could compete with him.

When this person got closer, Ling Han revealed killing intent.

That was Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows.

Among the people who wanted to interrogate him for colluding with the enemy, the Ten Thousand Shadows, Golden Silk Moth, and Yue Borong were the ones who danced the most happily. Now, Yue Borong had already been killed by him, and Ling Han had no intention of letting the Golden Silk Moth and Ten Thousand Shadows off the hook.

Of course he had to take revenge. What was there to be polite about?

The core fragment in front of him was already nearly within his reach. Ling Han stretched out his hand to grab it, and put it away thereafter.

“Hand over—” Heavenly Venerate Ten Thousand Shadows called out from behind, but when he discovered that the person in front of him was Ling Han, he turned around and left without another word.

This was truly decisive.

Ling Han was astounded. He hadn’t expected the Ten Thousand Shadows to be so cowardly.

However, when Ling Han thought about it again, he had sent Feng Wuding flying with a single strike. There was no one else with such abilities. The Ten Thousand Shadows clearly knew that Ling Han was so powerful, so how could it be that he would come over to court death? It wasn’t like he and Ling Han were good friends.

Being able to advance to Sixth Tier, how was it possible that he could not take things as they came?

Moreover, this was only one of the core fragments. It wasn’t as if there was no chance at all if he couldn’t obtain this fragment.

A Sixth Tier was extremely fast, and the Ten Thousand Shadows moved very swiftly, not giving Ling Han any chance to pursue him at all.

A smile gradually appeared on the corners of Ling Han’s lips. So what if he ran away? As long as he had Seventh-Tier battle prowess, wouldn’t killing Ten Thousand Shadows be a matter within arm’s reach?

“Brat!” With a furious roar, the sky shattered, and a terrifying power surged over.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains. He was actually charging over towards him.

Old man!

Ling Han cursed inwardly. This old fellow didn’t go and properly deal with Hysteria, but actually came to deal with him specifically?

How narrow-minded.

However, he immediately tore a rip into the Void without the slightest hesitation. As long as he had Seventh-Tier battle prowess, he would be able to enter the depths of the Genesis World of the last era and obtain an endless amount of Great Herbs, allowing his cultivation level to rapidly advance to the Sixth Tier, or even Seventh Tier. At that time, beating up Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains would naturally be child’s play.

‘Let’s go.’

Ling Han was also extremely decisive, and immediately fled into the Void.

Very quickly, he used the Powers of Dimension in his body to guide him back to the Profound Negative Realm.
