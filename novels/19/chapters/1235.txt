Chapter 1236: Where is the beauty?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Finally, Lin Yuqi allowed Ling Han to get off the carriage; she didn’t need to rush the temptation.

“F*ck!”

However, when Ling Han had alighted from the carriage, he couldn’t help but shout a curse loudly. When he had been conversing with Lin Yuqi, he didn’t know where the carriage had carried him off to. The place he alighted in was actually a dense forest, and he couldn’t spot any signs of the city at all.

Women... were indeed petty!

That azure-robed maidservant obviously bore a secret grudge against him, and had thus steered the carriage to who knew where, then tossed him out. Wasn’t this a deliberate trap for him?

He shook his head, and jumped onto the tip of a tree. After observing for a while, he first headed in a specific direction. When he came to a small town, after making some enquiries, he finally found out that this place was actually more than 800 miles away from Big Trade City.

That carriage was really quite fast. They didn’t seem to have been travelling all that long, did they?

Ling Han decided to simply not return to Big Trade City. In any case, his aim was Water Element Valley, and coincidentally, after he left Big Trade City, he just happened to have to travel in this direction too. Hence, not only was he not lost, he had instead gotten a free ride.

If the azure-robed woman found out, wouldn’t she explode in fury?

Ling Han laughed, and set off.

After only two days, Ling Han had arrived at the Water Element Valley. According to the information provided by Kang Xiu Yuan and Yun Yong Wang, he arrived at a place in the valley. There was a steep waterfall in this place, and it was covered by peaceful flowers. There was also a small courtyard, and it was like a hidden place of peace and serenity.

This was where the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden lived in seclusion.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel excited. He strode towards the courtyard as he thought of what he would first say when he saw the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.read comics on our ReadReadRead.live

As his thoughts danced, he arrived in front of the main doors. He raised his hand, and was just about to knock when he slightly started as a powerful feeling of anxiety suddenly rose up in his heart. However, he merely paused, and still continued the action of knocking.

Knock, knock, knock.

After a while, the sound of footsteps was heard from within.

Yet Ling Han’s brow was slightly creased. That was because these footsteps were not just one person’s, but rather three’s, and they were very jumbled up.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was living in seclusion on her own, so how could there be three pairs of footsteps?

This was not normal!

Instantly, his eyes froze over, and a powerful killing intent rose up in him. If anyone dared harm the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he would truly commit a massacre without the slightest hesitation.

Zhi, the wooden doors opened, and three people appeared at the doorway.

They were all men, and were clad in battle armor. It was clear that these suits of armor were slightly old and worm, and there were signs of blood on them as well, exuding an air of aggression and martial force. Furthermore, these three men looked to be in their thirties, and wore serious expressions, with an air of unswerving determination characteristic of soldiers.

“Who are you?” a man asked, with an arrogance that came from one with a high social position.

This man should be a high-ranking military officer in the army, which was why he behaved like general looking down on a foot soldier from the moment he spoke, a powerful forcefulness in his tone.

Ling Han was unmoved, and merely asked calmly, “And who are you people?”

“How dare you!!” The other two men drew part of the sabers at their waists simultaneously. Jiang, a crisp sound was heard, bringing a frightening air of violence with them. That was definitely a violent aura that could only be born from years of experience on the battlefield.

The man in the center stretched out a hand and pressed down, preventing the other two from taking any further action. Then, he turned to Ling Han and said, “I am the Left Vanguard subordinate to Great General Xie, Ma Zhang. Who are you, speak your name!”

Great General Xie? Left Vanguard?

Ling Han was surprised. He knew that these three people were all soldiers, but what he did not understand was how had the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden gotten involved with the army? If that wasn’t the case, then why would these three people have appeared here?

He paused for a moment, and then said, “I am Ling Han, and have come here to seek an old friend. May I know what Lord Ma has come here for?”

“Humph, even you dare to mind the business of others?” one soldier rebuked, though he did not draw his saber this time.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “This is not the battlefield, so there is no need to use the same attitude that you adopt in the army!”

“Humph, the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden has disappeared. Since you call yourself her old friend, we can just ask you. Where has she gone?” Ma Zhang stared at Ling Han, an astonishing killing intent exuding from his eyes, looking like he would be drawing his saber at the slightest disagreement.

The Heavenly Phoenix Maiden had disappeared?

Ling Han’s heart clenched. And why were these three people so determined to seek the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and whose command were they under? His expression turned cold as well. This was his reverse scale, which he could not allow others to touch.

“I would like to know as well. Why are you people looking for my friend!?” he uttered darkly.

“Subdue him!” Ma Zhang did not answer, and directly commanded his subordinates to move.

Shua, shua, the two soldiers instantly raced out. They were definitely not ordinary soldiers. Otherwise, how could they possibly be in the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier? When they made their moves, the powerful force of the Sun Moon Tier spread out, which was incredibly shocking.

Yet Ling Han could not even bother himself to parry. He merely gave a humph, and a sliver of heaven’s might channeled out. Instantly, the two gave a muffled grunt, and couldn’t even manage to keep hold of their sabers. With a clink, the sabers fell onto the ground, and the two men directly flopped onto the ground.

They couldn’t help but be shocked. Ling Han was only in the low extreme as well—moreover, he was only in the early stage—yet they couldn’t even manage to use a single move in front of him. This gap was too overwhelmingly big.

“En?” Ma Zhang’s eyes suddenly exploded with an astonishing fighting spirit. Ling Han’s abilities had provoked him, making him feel as if he had returned to the battlefield and encountered a frightening opponent.

“Why are you seeking the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden?” Ling Han asked again. This time, he did not hide his abilities in the slightest. A frightening aura rolled out as if a king had descended.

“Brat, you are too arrogant!” Ma Zhang humphed, drew out his saber, and charged out. Shua, bright light exploded, and shot out towards Ling Han.

Ling Han clenched his fist, and greeted the incoming saber light with a punch.

Peng, when his fist landed on the saber light, an incredible light exploded. Peng, two soldiers were instantly sent flying, and underneath the massive wave of power, the doors to the courtyard were also destroyed in a single instant.

Ling Han was enraged, and exclaimed, “Bastard, you actually dare destroy this place!” He raised his fists and threw a series of consecutive punches that landed on Ma Zhang.

Ma Zhang was both furious and shocked. He wasn’t the only one who was causing f****** damage in this place, okay? Didn’t Ling Han move as well? And he actually dared to blame him. This was really a case of a monk insulting a bald man. Still, this brat was practically a freak. He was obviously only in the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, so how could his battle prowess not be inferior to his in the least?

It should be know that he himself was in the peak stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, and his power was much stronger than Ling Han’s. It was just that the latter actually had a frightening intimidation, causing him to keep performing abnormally, unable to fully exhibit his power, and he could only bring things to a draw.

This was too shocking. When did such a young king tier appear in the Imperial Empire? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Lose!” he called out loudly as he brandished his saber in a series of mad blows. He was a soldier that had years of experience in the battlefield, and the thing he lacked the least was fighting spirit.

“Humph!” Ling Han threw one punch after another, which landed madly on Ma Zhang.

Peng, peng, peng. The two were engaged in a fierce battle. One had stronger power, but the other possessed a sliver of heaven’s might, and the victor was actually undecided. However, this courtyard naturally became very unfortunate, shattered into bits by the push and pull of power, and had completely turned into ruins.
