3096 Going out to play

“Senior Brother Li!” Zheng Tongfeng appeared in Li Changdan’s courtyard again.

“What’s wrong now?” Li Changdan, who was drinking tea, looked at Zheng Tongfeng.

Zheng Tongfeng appeared to be very angry, and said, “I just heard that Lord Sect Master bestowed a Meridian Guiding Fruit on Ling Han.”

“Huh?” This time, Li Changdan couldn’t remain calm anymore. He put down his teacup, and his sharp brows couldn’t help but furrow.

The position of Dao Child couldn’t be randomly conferred. Even if Sun Jianfang was the sect master, he couldn’t disregard the objections of the elders and randomly choose someone. In the eyes of the elders, Li Changdan was the most suitable candidate for the position of Dao Child.

Thus, he was not in a hurry on this point. He had plenty of time to deal with Ling Han.

However, the Meridian Guiding Fruit?

The Ancient Dao Sect could only produce 10 Meridian Guiding Fruits every year. Not only did the disciples need them, but even the elders needed them. This was because while one could become an elder after opening 10 meridians, the limit was 12.

Thus, an outstanding disciple like Li Changdan would only be able to obtain one Meridian Guiding Fruit every two years. As for others, they would be able to get one every four to five years.

Why had the sect master given it to a guy of unknown origin? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

What Divine Son? Li Changdan didn’t believe it.

“Tongfeng, Junior Brother Ling has just arrived, and isn’t familiar with this place. Show him around,” he said.

“What?!” Zheng Tongfeng almost jumped up. He still had to show that fellow around?

Li Changdan smiled faintly. “The town is quite fun. For example… Thousands Casino.”

Zheng Tongfeng was stunned at first. Then, he came to a realization, and said, “I’ll bring Junior Brother Ling to the casino now so he can have fun ‘to his heart’s content’!”

“To his heart’s content” naturally meant that Ling Han would lose everything, and even owe huge debts.

At that time, he would be humiliated. In fact, he might even have to use the Meridian Guiding Fruit to pay off some of his debt.

***

Ling Han first put away the Meridian Guiding Fruit, and placed it in a jade box. The latter could seal the essence of the precious fruit, and thus preserve it for a very, very long time.

He kept the Meridian Guiding Fruit with him. This thing was very precious. He was afraid that someone would steal it when he was out if he left it in the house.

…Huan Xue didn’t have any battle prowess, so if an elite came, he could completely steal it without anyone noticing.

Ling Han studied the Three Elements Formation for a while, and decided to first search for terrain that met the requirements for formations and practice the creation of formation foundations. In any case, there was a limit to the amount of time he could cultivate every day, so it was useless to cultivate any longer than that.

The Ancient Dao Sect was actually very large, occupying a large mountain. There were only ordinary wild beasts here, and no mutated Demonic Beasts.

Even if there had been, they would all have been cleaned out by now.

In addition, there was a town at the foot of the mountain, which was also under the protection of the Ancient Dao Sect. It was mainly occupied by ordinary people who served the Ancient Dao Sect.

As Ling Han walked, he took a piece of wood, and carved in it with a knife, practicing the creation of formation foundations. He was completely clueless, and it did not affect him at all.

After searching for half a day, he finally found a place that met the requirements.

“Right now, I’m only slightly stronger than an ordinary person. After walking for half a day, I’m actually already this tired,” Ling Han lamented. His entire body was covered in sweat, and he had to hurry back to wash up.

When Ling Han returned to his residence, he saw that there was actually a young man sitting in the room. Huan Xue had made him a cup of tea, and she was standing at the side, appearing somewhat respectful.

Ling Han frowned. He was an extremely protective person. Huan Xue was his maid, so why should she be ordered around by others?

“Junior Brother Ling!” Zheng Tongfeng immediately put down his teacup and laughed loudly. “My name is Zheng Tongfeng. I joined the sect seven years ago. I was busy practicing martial arts, and didn’t have the time to visit Junior Brother. Today, I’m here to apologize.”

Ling Han chuckled in his heart. Did he really think that he was a young brat who had just been born?

He smiled indifferently, and said, “Thank you, Senior Brother.”

“Come, come, come. I’ll bring you around. Although the heaven and earth have changed greatly, there are still many fun places.” Zheng Tongfeng pulled Ling Han out the door, not allowing Ling Han to object at all. His power was too strong.

Ling Han nodded at Huan Xue, indicating that there was no need for her to be nervous. Although Zheng Tongfeng was much stronger than Ling Han, he would not dare to make a move in the Ancient Dao Sect.

They descended the mountain, and soon arrived in the town.

Here, people were coming and going, and it was very lively. However, the strange thing was that apart from the side that led to the mountain, there were tall black walls erected everywhere around the town, emitting a metallic luster under the moonlight.

“Oh, although Lord Sect Master and other elites are holding down the fort, there will still occasionally be Demonic Beasts invading. Thus, this wall is used to defend against Demonic Beasts,” Zheng Tongfeng explained. “This isn’t as simple as just a wall. It’s connected to high-voltage electricity, and if a Demonic Beast below Six Meridians touches it, it will immediately turn into charcoal.”

Ling Han nodded. This was a little like the Realm Battlefield. Humans were at an absolute disadvantage, and had to worry about their lives at all times.

“Come, come, come. Let’s have a good time today,” Zheng Tongfeng said with a smile. However, when his smile disappeared, the corners of his mouth curled up with the hints of a sneer.

Ling Han’s horizons had really been broadened. Everything here used “electricity.”

There were “lights” that could glow without needing to be lit and “cars” that could drive automatically without needing to exert strength. Everything was because of electricity.

Under Zheng Tongfeng’s lead, they arrived in front of a five-storey building. Colorful neon lights flashed at the entrance, and beauties in revealing clothes flirted with others, attracting passersby to enter.

“Yo, isn’t this Young Master Zheng?” A beauty immediately walked over, her hips swaying, and placed her fair arm on Zheng Tongfeng’s shoulder. “You haven’t been here for a long time!”

Zheng Tongfeng was clearly a regular customer, and did not show a trace of shyness or panic. Instead, he moved and took quite a bit of advantage of the woman. Only then did he point at Ling Han and say, “Today, I’m here with Junior Brother Ling to have some fun.”

“Yo, Sisters, quickly come and greet Young Master Ling!” the beauty said to the other three women at the door.

The three women immediately surrounded him, wanting to squeeze into Ling Han’s embrace.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and he gently pushed the three women outward with a shove of his hands.

What a joke. How could he fall for such promiscuous women?

He turned his head, and asked, “Senior Brother Zheng, what’s so fun about this?”

‘What an unromantic fellow,’ Zheng Tongfeng said disdainfully in his heart, but he laughed out loud. “Don’t be anxious, don’t be anxious. I can guarantee that it will be fun inside.”

He brought Ling Han in, and the air of extravagance and wealth instantly assaulted their faces.

The building was filled with gambling tables. There were gamblers with bloodshot eyes and flushed faces, as well as beautiful women in revealing clothes who were stirring up the emotions of the gamblers.

Why did Zheng Tongfeng bring him to the casino?

Ling Han immediately came to a realization. He was trying to use gambling to corrode him, and might even be trying to make him owe a huge debt.

‘How did I offend him?’

Ling Han reflected inwardly. He had seized the position of future Dao Child the moment he arrived, and had even been bestowed with a Meridian Guiding Fruit. This would definitely make people jealous.

Therefore, there should be many people in the Ancient Dao Sect who hated him, and were waiting to see him make a fool of himself.

‘Alright, let’s play then.’
