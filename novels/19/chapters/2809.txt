2810 Mending the Eighth Seal

“Let’s go!”

They headed out towards that wide gulf. Ling Han and the Empress had altered their appearance, and made some slight changes to their auras. At present, Ling Han was too big a target, and one only had to spot the Empress, and they would be able to guess that the other person had to be Ling Han.

Thus, they could only make some alterations to their appearance and auras to avoid attracting unnecessary trouble.

…What was everyone here for?

What else could it be but a Heavenly Venerable Seal? Ling Han himself had one!

The group entered into the gulf, and all of them channeled their colossal power into defense to protect themselves against the terrible environmental conditions here.

The environment here was really terrible. On one side, there were surging flames, and on the other, there was bone-chilling ice. Two completely opposite powers taking effect on one at the same time would be an indescribable torture, so they had to use their own power to resist it.

Otherwise, one side of their body would be burned to nothing, while the other side would be frozen into an icicle.

Heavenly-Venerable-Tier power could only be resisted by Heavenly Venerates. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Thankfully, everyone was not very weak, and it was not difficult for them to deal with this kind of pressure. However, if a battle began here, there would definitely not even be many First Tier Heavenly Venerates that could unleash more than 50% of their usual battle prowess.

This gulf was very big and deep. Everyone descended for around an hour before they could finally see the ground level.

Here, the extremely terrible environment finally turned better, but an expansive, grand aura was endlessly spreading out, and one would involuntarily feel reverent.

“Is it the aura of that Heavenly Venerate?”

“He has already been dead for more than 100 epochs, but his aura is still here. A Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate has truly surpassed mortality and taken steps into immortality.”

Everyone felt rueful. It was still unknown where this Heavenly Venerate was actually buried, but this majestic aura was already so surging like an ocean that others could only gasp in amazement.

This could just barely be considered a plain, but it was not very flat and smooth. There were multiple sharp rocks protruding out of the ground. Though they weren’t placed very close together, and were dark in color, they gave one a feeling of discomfort.

“Where do we go from here?” Everyone was troubled. This was a plain, and they could go in any direction, but which direction was the correct one?

“Just any which direction then,” Ling Han said.

Could one be so casual when exploring the tomb of an ancient Heavenly Venerate?

But when everyone thought about it, they did not have any clues, so what could they do if they were not going to be casual about it?

Then, they’d just simply choose some direction and set out.

Going by instincts, Ling Han found a direction, and thus everyone advanced in this direction.

“Father, I heard that you have given me a younger sister?” Ling Jianxue approached him. In all these years, he had been cultivating in the World’s Paramount Martial Academy and teaching disciples there. He had not returned to Ling City even once, and it was unknown just how many times Helian Xunxue had complained about this rebellious, unfilial son who now no longer wanted his mother after getting a wife.

Hence, he had not met Ling Xi.

Ling Han nodded. “Much better-looking than you.”

Ling Jianxue’s expression couldn’t help but darken. ‘Your precious daughter is a treasure, but why do you have to compare us? Whom in the world have I offended?’

“Father, hadn’t I just not gone back to see you guys for a few years? Do you have to say that?”

Ling Han laughed, and communicated with him via divine sense. “Your sister’s name is Ling Xi, and she is presently in the martial academy.”

“What?!” Ling Jianxue instantly got a shock. “Ling Xi is my sister?”

He knew about Ling Xi. She was too well-known. Not only was she publicly acknowledged as the most beautiful girl in the martial academy, her natural talent in cultivation was indescribably strong. It was said that someone had been eyeing Ling Xi, and had once taken advantage of the fact that she had been training outside, wanting to forcefully take her down, but what happened in the end?

A Sixth Heaven Celestial King had made his move, but he was beaten horribly by a Third Heaven Celestial King, and then dragged back to the martial academy. He obediently confessed what he had done, and willingly accepted his punishment.

Everyone was guessing that there had to be a powerful Heavenly Venerate standing behind Ling Xi. Otherwise, how could she possibly have beaten a Sixth Heaven when her cultivation level was only the Third Heaven?

Now that he had found out that Ling Xi was his own sister, Ling Jianxue naturally understood. This Heavenly Venerate that was standing behind Ling Xi was actually his old man.

“Father, you are really biased!” he exclaimed in jealousy.

Ling Han laughed. “Your sister is a girl, so how can a gruff man like you compare?” When Ling Han had the ability to move a small world, Ling Jianxue had already advanced to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, so there was no need for him to go to the trouble at all.

Ling Jianxue naturally knew this as well. Thus, he was just grouching.

As the father and son spoke, a massive mountain very soon appeared in front of them. This mountain was quite strange as well. It was rounded and plump, like a bowl that had been turned upside down.

Upon closer look, this was no mountain, but rather a giant burial mound. There were multiple golden veined patterns on the burial mound, and they would occasionally flicker at a mysterious rhythm.

“Yi, we managed to find the place just by simply walking around?” Everyone was surprised. Their luck was really too good, wasn’t it?

“Let’s see if there is any entrance.”

However, Ling Han was just staring blankly at the veined patterns on the giant burial mound, feeling surges of power in his body that gave him boundless enlightenment.

The Eighth Seal moved restlessly, and actually seemed like it was slowly mending!

“Ling Han?” Everyone looked towards him.

Ling Han nodded. “You guys can go and search first. If you can enter, you don’t have to wait for me. A sudden inspiration has come upon me, and I am going to stay here for a while.”

Everyone could not understand, but since Ling Han was saying that, they naturally would not forcefully drag Ling Han with them, either.

“Be careful!” everyone said.

“You guys take care too,” Ling Han replied as well. Now was not the time when everyone had joined forces against Hysteria. Everyone was just working for their own desires.

They all nodded and left.

Ling Han sat down in a cross-legged position, staring at the giant burial mound. Endless enlightenment rose up in his heart. The Eighth Seal was indeed showing signs of mending. It was flickering with light, and there was a boundless feeling of profound mystery about it.

Time passed quietly, and the Eighth Seal was slowly mending. The speed was not very fast, but it was acceptable to Ling Han.

He felt like there was some resonance between his will and this giant mound, and that was why enlightenment had come to him, and he was capable of even mending a Heavenly Venerable Seal.

However, this was also because Ling Han had been studying the Eighth Seal constantly all these years, and had spent a very, very long time on it. Otherwise, this sudden enlightenment would not have come to him, and everything wouldn’t have come smoothly.

He revealed a slight smile. As the level of resonance became deeper and deeper, his appreciation also became deeper and deeper. The mending of the Eighth Seal was also becoming faster and faster.

Half a year later, Ling Han suddenly broke into laughter.

...

The Eighth Seal had finally been completed!

He attempted to use the Eighth Seal to stimulate the unique power of the Flaming Frost Realm, testing to see how far this seal could accelerate his speed of cultivation.

The result stunned him.

27 times!

It should be known that the Ninth Seal that had been nurtured from the blood, flesh, essence, and souls of countless Third Tier Heavenly Venerates had only managed to increase the efficiency by only 15 times.

This was practically double that.

Ling Han was stunned. This was too amazing. It did not just increase the rate of cultivation—when it was used to augment battle prowess, the boost provided by the Eighth Seal would also cause the scale of increase to his battle prowess to be incredibly shocking.

As expected, what truly belonged to him would be the very strongest.

Why was the Eighth Seal so powerful?

That was because it had been nurtured by Ling Han himself, so it was the most suited to him. Even if he dug it out, and had Ling Jianxue inherit it, it would already be quite impressive if Ling Jianxue even managed to unleash more than a dozen times of the efficiency.

Ling Han was very pleased. He had really been right in coming here. Even if there was nothing else to be gained, merely this alone was already completely worth the trip.

...

“What are you laughing for? So noisy!” A voice rang out behind Ling Han.
