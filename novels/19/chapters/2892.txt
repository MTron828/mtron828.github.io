2893 Waiting For Trash

The members of Xuanwu Alliance certainly knew that Fei Baizhu was dead, but they weren’t very sure about the details.

Now after hearing what Ling Han had said, they then knew that this guy was the murderer.

Hiss, this was terrible indeed.

At that time, Fei Baizhu wasn’t the only one who died, but there were actually two Fourth Tiers and one Third Tier.

!!

It was quite strange: the Fourth Tiers died, but one of the Third Tiers managed to escape and returned.

However, Ling Han had already killed three Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates from the Xuanwu Alliance. No, if they included the White Flames Heavenly Venerate, that would make it four. Then would he still care about killing four more?

They wanted to cry but had no tears. Why were they so unlucky?

This time, they would definitely be silenced by Ling Han.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “I was actually thinking of meeting that trash… That’s strange, why would someone call themselves trash1?”

“His name is Fei Wu,” the Empress corrected.

“That means he’s trash,” Hu Niu argued.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I need someone to help me inform that piece of trash: tell him that I’m waiting for him here. If he wants to avenge his son’s death, then hurry up and come over. Otherwise, after I’ve finished digging the vein of ore, I won’t have the time to continue waiting for him.”

Everyone was stunned. What did Ling Han mean by this? Did he really intend to fight against Fei Wu?

Hiss, despite that you being extremely strong and capable of crushing Fourth Tiers, could you really be a Fifth Tier’s match? Furthermore, Fei Wu was at the middle stage of the Fifth Tier, and his battle prowess was incredible and incomparably terrifying.

Such cockiness was insanely off the charts.

However, in this way, one of them would be able to leave this place alive.

These people were all filled with the desire for life. Heavenly Venerates were all high and mighty, and even the heavens had to respect them. How lofty was their status, and who among them would be willing to die? Thus, although none of them begged for mercy due to their pride, their gazes betrayed them as they stared at Ling Han with puppy eyes.

‘Choose me! Choose me!’

This was their silent cry.

Ling Han pressed his hand down. Pa, pa, pa. All the Heavenly Venerates here were crushed to pieces by his terrifying power, and only one Second Tier was spared.

Even though a Heavenly Venerate would have experienced major crises before, seeing more than 10 same-level and high-level Heavenly Venerates die like weeds in front of him, that Second Tier was still shocked to the point that his legs went weak, and he felt an uncomfortable feeling of wanting to vomit.

“Go, don’t waste any more time,” Ling Han said gently to him.

However, in the eyes of that Second Tier, Ling Han was like a devil. The former hurriedly broke into a run, and only after running far away did he truly believe that Ling Han had really spared him. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief, and just realized that his back was completely damp with sweat.

“You really want to fight against a Fifth Tier?” The Empress looked at Ling Han. She knew how terrifying a Fifth Tier was.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “My cultivation level is increasing, so it’s inevitable that I’ll have to fight against such an elite. Why don’t we fight now?”

“Are you confident?” the Empress asked again.

Ling Han nodded.

“Hehe, since Ling Han said he’s confident, then he definitely is!” Hu Niu said laughingly.

The three of them continued to mine. With a cheat-like grandmaster of raw stone like Ling Han around, their mining speed was astonishingly fast. However, this ore vein specialized in producing Great Herbs, and not a single Heavenly Venerable Seal could be found, causing Ling Han to feel extremely disappointed.

“Great Herbs aren’t bad, either. They can help you improve your cultivation level without falling behind,” the Empress consoled him.

Ling Han nodded. After he advanced to the Third Tier, even the life essence of a Fourth Tier elite was not enough for him. He would absorb it all in a few breaths. If he wanted to feel “bloated” like before, he would definitely need a Fifth Tier.

“However, the raw stones here are almost all mined. Why isn’t that trash here yet? Is he really such trash?”

Another 10 days passed, and the ore vein was completely mined. Ling Han decided to wait for another 10 days for Fei Wu. If Fei Wu still did not come, then he could not be bothered to wait any longer. In any case, there would come a time when they would meet again in the future, and Fei Wu was not the only Fifth Tier in the world. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, only seven days later, Fei Wu arrived.

An extremely terrifying aura enveloped Ling Han, instantly causing him to come to his senses. He felt as if he was facing Xin Qihu.

However, he was no longer the Second Tier of the past, and his current battle prowess could completely rival that of a Fifth Tier.

“I’m here.” A leisurely voice rang out. Boom! Even though the voice clearly wasn’t loud, the mountains collapsed one after another, and the entire mountain range was flattened in an instant.

Of course, Heavenly Venerates would have this kind of divine might, but, generally speaking, Heavenly Venerates would control it as there was no need to cause great destruction. This would cause them to be easily targeted by the heaven and earth, and should the collective power of the entire dimension be used to suppress them, even a Seventh Tier would also suffer.

However, this was the Void. The dimension had died long ago, so they naturally weren’t afraid of being targeted. Furthermore, this person was probably filled with anger as well.

Ling Han floated up with a smile, hands behind his back, and said, “So trash is here?”

“You won’t benefit at all from being glib-tongued in front of me.” A figure appeared. He was extremely short, and upon closer inspection, it was actually a little boy who was only five or six bu2 tall. However, he was bearing an extremely mature expression.

Ling Han was astounded. “I say, trash, you merely have a terrible name, but there’s no need to reform your already-grown body, right?”

That little boy instantly revealed a furious expression. He was Fei Wu, a dignified Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

The reason why he had turned into a little boy was because of a secret technique he had created himself. He continuously repeated the process of being born, growing up, and dying of old age to comprehend his Dao.

However, Ling Han was too wicked, actually making fun of his name.

“Brother Fei, there’s no need to lower yourself to the level of a mere Third Tier.” Another voice rang out, and a slender man appeared by Fei Wu’s side. He was handsome and energetic, and whether it was in terms of appearance or bearing, there were no negative points to speak of.

This was the other Alliance Leader of the Xuanwu Alliance, Qi Xuan. He was also a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han looked at him, and said, “Sissy, what are you talking about?”

Qi Xuan couldn’t help but be stunned. Sissy?

He was a little handsome, but he had nothing to do with being a sissy, okay?

How could this brat speak so carelessly, and attack so powerfully with his tongue?

“He’s just sharp-tongued. Don’t mind him, just suppress him!” Fei Wu said. His feet moved, and he was already closing in on Ling Han. He stretched out a hand, and it transformed into a huge mountain. There were seals radiating with light, and there were phenomena of sun, moon, and stars, as if he was opening up a new world.

Fifth Tier elites were indeed extraordinary, as if they could create a world with a single thought.

“Suppress your sister!” Ling Han roared, and took the initiative to counter the attack.

...

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The battle between the two great elites was incomparably intense.

Qi Xuan couldn’t help but reveal a look of surprise, because while Fei Wu had the upper hand, Ling Han wasn’t much inferior. He was definitely capable of fighting back.

One had to know that Fei Wu was at the middle stage of Fifth Tier, only slightly inferior to Qi Xuan.

Of course, if this continued, there would come a day when Fei Wu would be able to win, but who knew how long that would take? Furthermore, Ling Han could completely escape at any time. With battle prowess on the same level, it would be easy for either of them to leave.
