Chapter 759: The Powerful Corpse Two

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Corpse Two frowned, and said, “Earlier, when your body flashed, there was an instant when you left my divine sense’s range, and that must be related to how you removed the corpse poison.”

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Correct.”

“What method exactly did you use?” Corpse Two seemed extremely curious.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Seeing that you’ve explained so much for me, I’ll answer you too. I have a treasure that can dispel corpse poison, no big deal.”

Sh*t, no kidding! Corpse Two said inwardly. He obviously knew that the corpse poison couldn’t be taken care of with Ling Han’s strength, and even that no medicinal pill in the world could do it! Because, in the previous life, he was the world’s strongest being, and corpse poison formed over thirty thousand years surpassed any kind of spirit medicine that existed currently.

Just like a Heaven Tier facing a Shattering Void Tier elite, it was impossible!

At best, it’d be slowed down, as Ling Han did earlier. But now, the corpse poison was neutralized, which he couldn’t understand at all, and couldn’t accept.

How could it be so? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What treasure exactly could actually resolve thirty-thousand-year-old corpse poison?

Ling Han clenched his fist, and said, “Alright, the wrangling ends. You won’t tell me the Thousand Corpse Sect’s secret, and I won’t tell you about my trump card, so there’s nothing to talk about. Only punches and kicks will reveal the truth!”

Corpse Two smiled faintly, and said, “When I kill you and turn you into a Corpse Soldier, I’ll make sure you spit out the secret. You know, the moment when one becomes a Corpse Soldier, the memory will still be present, but it’ll soon disappear.”

He was like a scholar, and not a wicked and evil corpse.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You won’t have the chance!”

He had too many trump cards—even if Ice Dragon Ground Blast Formation couldn’t be activated, Black Tower’s power boost could make his battle prowess skyrocket to the Shattering Void Tier, and a Heaven Tier elite would be annihilated with the raise of a hand. But, he didn’t want to use up the chance for the power boost now. It had to be used at a key moment.

Corpse Two also clenched both fists, and said, “Then let’s see who’s stronger!”

Ling Han let out a battle cry and initiated the attack.

Earlier, he’d been ambushed, and if it weren’t for Black Tower’s existence, he definitely would’ve already become a Corpse Soldier. This shocked and angered him, and he couldn’t be careless under any circumstances in the future—having walked by the gates of hell, he was obviously pent up with anger.

Just like he’d said, the wrangling was over, and he knew what he needed to know—the battle obviously followed.

Corpse Two was unafraid, and greeted him with his fists.

At the start, they were both very careful; before knowing the opponent’s true strength, neither dared to charge recklessly. However, as they fought, they increased their battle prowess used.

Ling Han touched his hands, and a gold light instantly spread as he activated the Earth Overturning Seal. With his current Origin Power and physical strength, in addition to the Earth Overturning Seal, his battle prowess obviously rocketed to the Heaven Tier.

“Breaking through the tier barrier at the Deity Transformation Tier, you’re really impressive!” Although Corpse Two’s each attack was as heavy as a mountain, he had no expression all along, and didn’t seem to be good at controlling the muscles on his face—after all, he’d just been reborn.

“How else will I kill you?” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Kill me?” Corpse Two laughed loudly. “Where did you get such confidence? Nevermind, I’ll show you my true battle prowess!” He snorted, and bone spikes grew out of his fists.

Ling Han suddenly felt a chill within. Earlier, he’d been definitely penetrated by these bone spikes, and that was why he’d been infected by the corpse poison.

It couldn’t be underestimated.

He wrapped Origin Power around his hands and unleashed the Earth Overturning Seal—golden light filling the sky—and, activating the Eye of Truth, his battle prowess increased some more, reaching Heaven Tier two stars. However, after crossing one great tier, the increase of one star of battle prowess was extremely difficult, and even if he activated one more Mystical Power, his battle prowess only increased by one star.

Corpse Two released punches like rain, and didn’t care about fighting Ling Han in close range.

He indeed had the capacity.

Corpse bones not breaking down in thirty thousand years was not only because they were in a land of absolute yin where yang was extinguished—in life, he definitely had also been a physical cultivator, which allowed his bones to bear the erosion of tens of thousands of years.

Thus, his physique was formidable, and he obviously didn’t fear close-quarters combat at all.

Ling Han fought head on for a while, and knew well that the toughness of Corpse Two’s physique was above his.

The Shattering Void Tier!

It simply cheated more than Ling Han did, because Corpse Two cultivated his physique to this level when he’d been alive. In this life, Corpse Two gained consciousness, and even if his cultivation was only in the Body Refining Tier, his physique was a hundred-percent Shattering Void Tier.

Of course, it was set in stone, and couldn’t improve any further—unless Corpse Two advanced into the Shattering Void Tier and had a fortuitous encounter, his physique wouldn’t improve one step further.

It was easier said than done, and at least except for Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, there was no other art that could do so.

Ling Han quietly activated the demonic patterns. Aren’t you kickass? Then have a taste of this.

Peng!

The Earth Overturning Seal bumped onto the corpse’s fist, and the bone spike that jutted out was annihilated, albeit just one.

“Hm?” Corpse Two was astonished. The bone spikes were extensions, and in terms of hardness, were obviously no inferior to his physique—but, it still broke down in one hit, something he found hard to accept.

He stared at Ling Han’s left hand as black rays of light flickered in his eyes, and, after a while, he frowned, and said, “Power of laws? How’s it possible, you’re only in the Deity Transformation Tier, so how can you cultivate power of laws?”

“You actually know of power of laws too?” Ling Han tried to fish out more information since that arrogant tower always spoke reservedly, making him unclear about this.

Corpse Two snorted, and said, “After reaching the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier, one will have the right to contact the power of laws! Could it be, you’re the reincarnation of a Shattering Void Tier warrior?”

So that’s what it was! Ling Han said inwardly, but his expression remained unchanged in case Corpse Two saw through his pretending to be in the know and fishing out information. He smiled, and said, “You were so kickass in life, can’t you use the power of laws?”

Corpse Two was gloomy. He’d only inherited the body’s toughness, and couldn’t possibly possess the martial intent from the previous life, or else he’d be the strongest in the world once he was born—the one and only!

He still had to walk the martial arts tiers step by step and climb to the Heaven Tier over twenty years, which was an inconceivable miracle. Built on top of a tough physique and walking in old steps, there was definitely no bottleneck at all, and each tier could be cultivated to extreme perfection.

However, the power of laws... that needed him to reach the Shattering Void Tier, and it had to be after he advanced to the ninth layer before he qualified to cultivate it again. It had nothing to do with the body—it concerned the comprehension of the Heavenly Dao.

Thus, he guessed that Ling Han was the reincarnation of a Shattering Void Tier elite, or else how could Ling Han possibly grasp the power of laws?

“So you can’t!” Ling Han laughed loudly, and instantly attacked fiercely like a tide. The power of laws could actually only be used at the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier—now he was kickass.
