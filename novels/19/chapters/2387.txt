Chapter 2388: Advancing Physique

Ling Han was astonished as he glanced at the ancestor of the Kong Clan.

This old man was truly good at hiding things! The treasure chamber was in the Seven Majestic Heaven, yet he had situated the clan in the Scorching Flames Heaven. There were a whopping three Heavenly Realms between these two places!

Couldn’t he have situated the clan somewhere closer? At least somewhere in the same Heavenly Realm?

However, this was naturally an arrangement made in order to keep the secret. The sudden rise of the Kong Clan had been far too unnatural. Anyone could see a problem. In fact, it was certain that members within the clan had also grown greedy and restless, yearning to take the treasure chamber for themselves.

Thus, the ancestor of the Kong Clan had decided to build the clan in the Scorching Flames Heaven. ‘’ That way, no one would ever suspect that the treasure chamber was located in the Seven Majestic Heaven.

Otherwise, would it not be simpler to build the clan in the Seven Majestic Heaven? That way, it would definitely be easier to travel to and from the treasure chamber.

Judging from this, it was clear that the ancestor of the Kong Clan was a careful and meticulous person. It was also no wonder that he had placed seals in his own mind. However, it was also clear that this treasure chamber was definitely a profound place. It was because of this that the ancestor of the Kong Clan was so unbelievably careful.

Ling Han was completely unafraid. He was simply filled with eagerness and anticipation. It was genuinely possible that this was the treasure chamber of a Five-Star Alchemist! It was genuinely possible that he would find Celestial King Tier alchemical pills inside!

In order to save time, Ling Han drew most of the people into his Spatial God Tool. Without the Black Tower, he felt that things were much more troublesome than before. After all, Spatial God Tools weren’t exactly safe places to stay inside. They could be shattered very easily. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It would be much better if he could forge them from Divine Metal.

Ling Han turned his attention to the Green Song Divine Sword. However, this was a Divine Sword. It was one matter that one couldn’t unleash its full might if the sword didn’t recognize them as its master. However, if he wanted to “dissect” or damage it, the sword would definitely unleash its might by itself.

This was the grand power of a Celestial King! Who dared to challenge it? At the very least, Ling Han wasn’t keen to face it.

However, Wally was extremely eager, and he wanted Ling Han to obtain the Green Song Divine Sword for him. He said that Ling Han owed him this.

“You need 100,000,000 years just to digest that one scroll, so giving it to you is definitely a waste. I’ll look after it in the meantime. Rest assured, I definitely won’t steal your things!” Ling Han said in righteousness.

“Oh, that’s right, are you able to eliminate the Celestial King Symbols on the sword?”

If these Celestial King Symbols were destroyed, the Celestial Tool would be reduced to nothing more than a sharp weapon. It would only possess the innate might of Divine Metal, and it would be unable to unleash the power of Celestial Kings.

In the eyes of others, this would be a humongous waste. It would be a case of neglecting the essentials to attend to the trifles!

Why was a Celestial Tool freakish? It was exactly because of these Celestial King Symbols! Only Divine Metal could withstand such power, and all other materials would crumble under the magnificent power of Celestial Kings.

Wally nodded, and said, “My body can automatically extract all fundamental matter.”

“Can I learn this skill?” Ling Han shamelessly asked.

“No, you can’t,” Wally replied with a shake of his head. “My body is constructed from superstring materials, allowing me to possess an incredible recovery ability.”

Ling Han had indeed witnessed this ability before. He had managed to recover even after being smashed to pieces by the large black dog. Moreover, it was as if he hadn’t experienced any wounds at all. Upon seeing this, the large black dog had thirsted for such an ability.

However, it was a shame that it couldn’t be taught.

Ling Han shook his head. He might as well go and play with Little Terror. It was recultivating using the cultivation system of the Celestial Realm, and it had to be said that its progress was as slow as could be. This was naturally because it was formed by the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm, meaning that it was born to fight for the Foreign Realm. Now that it had come to the Celestial Realm, it was naturally being targeted and suppressed to a great degree.

If it weren’t for Wally performing some “surgery” on Little Terror, changing some things and teaching it some other things, Little Terror would very likely have been immediately targeted and killed by heaven and earth upon entering the Celestial Realm.

Ling Han accelerated time for Little Terror, allowing it to develop quicker and advance to the expected cultivation level quicker. No matter what, it at least needed to return to the Ascending Origin Tier.

Speaking of returning to the Ascending Origin Tier… After traveling for seven days, Ling Han also felt like he had accumulated enough experience and comprehension. He couldn’t find a single flaw in his cultivation. Even Wally nodded in agreement.

This was naturally thanks to the Heavenly Venerate Blood. Otherwise, Ling Han might have needed to cultivate for dozens of years more before advancing.

He unleashed his cultivation, and resolutely invited heavenly tribulation.

Half a day passed, and Ling Han descended from the sky, unscathed.

He got the others to obtain a carriage, and he sat inside to comprehend Dao. After his facing heavenly tribulation, a wealth of enlightenment had burst into his mind. This was mainly because the Heavenly Venerate Blood had fused together with the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

After reaching such a cultivation level, trying to advance his physique and divine sense with the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll no longer relied on cultivating in seclusion. Instead, it required a vast amount of natural treasures. However, even though Ling Han had obtained the resources of so many Ancestral Kings, he was still extremely tight on resources.

After all, few Ancestral Kings would keep all of their belongings in their Spatial God Tool. In any case, during such intense battles, how could the Spatial God Tools of the Ancestral Kings have withstood the might of fellow Ancestral Kings or even Heavenly Venerates? Many of them had naturally been destroyed, with their contents disappearing into the void.

Ling Han’s physique was indeed advancing. However, it was doing so at a snail’s pace. After facing heavenly tribulation, however, he had unexpectedly activated the Heavenly Venerate Blood. This made him feel like his physique could advance to a new height.

Just what kind of beings were Heavenly Venerates? These were beings who were transcendent above Regulations! Just a single drop of their blood was unfathomably valuable, to say nothing of a handful.

It was far more useful than any natural treasure. However, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le had been afraid of killing Ling Han, so he had slowed down the effects of the Heavenly Venerate Blood. After being stimulated by heavenly tribulation, however, this blood had unleashed a small portion of its power.

Ling Han was slowly enveloped by a thick cocoon. Its surface was golden-yellow, and it more so shimmered with 18 different colors. It radiated with a paramount might.

In the presence of such might, the others couldn’t advance at all. They didn’t dare to move this cocoon, so they could only pause their trip.

Several days passed, and the golden cacoon finally cracked apart. Ling Han soared into the sky, his body completely naked. However, no one could see him clearly. This was because he was shrouded in colorful light that pulsated with an astonishing aura.

“Ah! My eyes!” the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire exclaimed as he hurriedly turned around. Even though he couldn’t see clearly, he was naturally aware of Ling Han’s current state. He had actually seen the naked body of another man! He could barely contain his emotions.

Pa!

The Empress immediately smacked him to the floor. He actually dared to shun the body of her man? Was he tired of living? Being able to witness it was his fortune!

The Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire could only hide his grief. He knew just how prideful the Empress was. Trying to reason with her would be completely futile. Thus, he had no option but to swallow his emotions. In any case, who told him to voice his feelings?

Ling Han retrieved some clothes from his Spatial God Tool before descending to the ground. He was beaming from ear to ear.

“How do you feel?” the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou asked as they gathered over. Meanwhile, his other wives all remained in the Spatial God Tool.

They were all filled with eagerness. Ling Han had actually been shrouded in colorful light! This was a phenomenon unique to Celestial Kings.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I’m still nowhere near the level of Celestial King.” The colorful light had appeared due to the Heavenly Venerate Blood.

“You’re not far off,” Wally said. Green light scanned Ling Han up and down, and he continued, “Right now, your Defense Index has reached 4800. Once it reaches 5000, that will correspond to your so-called Celestial King Tier.”

This was absolutely terrifying. One had to realize that Celestial Kings could only gain such a powerful defense after channeling the power of Regulations. However, Ling Han’s physique alone had already reached such a state—it was eternal. Comparing the two, it was easy to see just how freakish he was.

Ling Han was also just learning of this. He only knew that his physique had advanced by a considerable amount and that it was still unable to withstand the might of Celestial Tools head-on. However, he hadn’t realized that the gap was already so small.
