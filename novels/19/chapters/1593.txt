Chapter 1594: Close at hand

In this place, space was shaped and overlapped, which was extremely strange.

Every step Ling Han took forwards could possibly mean that he would be forced to take three steps back. It was possible that every step he took backwards would mean taking 10 steps forwards. In this place, vision and divine sense had both lost their meaning, and there was a very strong deceptive quality about it.

“Only if you have grasped the Regulations of Space would you be able to possibly find a shortcut,” Small Tower said. “As for you, you can only spend your time on probing slowly. Furthermore, even if you have found a conclusive pattern in the end, the Void Flower only needs to make a slight change, and you will have to start back from the beginning.

“In the Celestial Realm, Celestial Kings that have grasped the Regulations of Time and Space are the hardest to deal with.” Small Tower was suddenly in high spirits, and took the initiative to explain. “However, this kind of Celestial King is only troublesome. If one encounters a Celestial King that has cultivated the Regulations of Massacre, then that would possibly be even more unfortunate. With a thought, both your bones and body would be destroyed.”

“Merely in terms of battle prowess, Massacre Celestial Kings could even battle stronger opponents. There was once a Massacre Celestial King of the Fourth Heaven that has killed a Celestial King of the Fifth Heaven. However, if one has reached the Ninth Heaven, then there is no difference whatever Regulations one has cultivated. They are all standing at the apex of Celestial Dao, so there are no weaker or stronger Regulations. The only deciding factor would be the level of grasp over Regulations that every Celestial King has.”

Ling Han paused, and asked, “Have you eaten something wrong today? Why have you become such a chatterbox?”

“...I can’t bother with you.” Small Tower humphed proudly, and ignored Ling Han.

It was too bad that Hu Niu was not here. This girl seemed to be born with a compass, and there was never any need to worry about getting lost with her around.

Ling Han had the Empress come out. Firstly, the Empress was a Divine Fetus, and perhaps had an inconceivable ability, and secondly, he was also bored. Sharing some loving moments while embracing the Empress was better than him sitting around all by his lonesome, after all.

Moreover, the Empress had nine doppelgangers. Her main body coming out to accompany him would only mean wasting one-tenth of the time used for cultivation.

“Void Flower!” The Empress was also stunned. She vaguely knew of some matters of the Celestial Realm, which came from her bloodline memories, and added with the fact that she had refined Gu Daoyi’s Divine Fetus, her understanding of the Celestial Realm was in truth much higher than Ling Han’s.

“Some Regulations are especially difficult to cultivate, such as Time, Space, Massacre, and Darkness, because these Regulations are not visible in the world, so you would not know where to start to grasp these Regulations. You could only hope to grasp them through consuming some specific Celestial medicine.

“Before reaching the Nine Heavens of Celestial King, Space is definitely one of the strongest Regulations.”

Ling Han nodded. “Then I definitely have to obtain this Void Flower.”

The two of them cooperated, and spread out their divine sense to sense the changes in the space, slowly progressing in their advance.

This was also because their power was insufficient. Otherwise, even if the overlapping space here was even more complicated, so what? They would be able to destroy it with a single blow, and forcibly create a new path.

Too bad, they were not Celestial beings, so how could they possibly oppose the space that the Celestial medicine had disturbed?

Thankfully, the two of them were prodigies among prodigies, and with their joint efforts, they still greatly increased the rate of their advance. However, they feared that it would be like what Small Tower had said. If the Void Flower suddenly changed the Regulations of Space, then they would have to start back from the beginning.

Weng, after a few days, a golden pathway spread out. A Demon Master had arrived. This Void Flower was too obvious, and even if there were a few galaxies separating them, one would still be able to see it clearly. It would be the real strange thing if it did not draw out a few Demon Masters.

That was a man that looked to be only in his fifties, and he appeared to be very formidable. He didn’t even cast another look at the Cloud Piercing Shuttle. Without entering into the Genesis Tier, how could they possibly draw his notice?

He, too, spread out his divine sense, wanting to find a path in this complicated space.

Ling Han was unafraid of this Demon Master, not because he still had two chances for a power boost, but rather because the space here was too complex. Even if it looked like they were only a dozen over miles away, it was highly possible that a Demon Master would have to circle around for a few years before he finally reached them.

The mystical power of space would cause anyone to exclaim in surprise.

Ling Han couldn’t help but be greatly interested. If he could grasp the Regulations of Space, then when the attacks of others were directed at him, he could directly shift them to another place, or even redirect them back at his opponents.

And if he attacked, he could instantly breach the distance of space. Then, it would perhaps be possible for him to kill someone even if he was in another galaxy.

Too bad the Regulations of Space were not something that you could directly grasp through observing the heaven and earth, and had to be grasped through consuming Celestial medicine.

Weng, weng, weng.

Multiple golden paths materialized as more and more Demon Masters had arrived. Clearly, they were all interested in this Celestial Flower.

Another month later, Ling Han suddenly discovered that a flower that was only about a foot tall had appeared in front of him, and had the same appearance as that Void Flower that towered to the skies. It looked colored, yet seemed to be absent of color at the same time. It was clearly so empty that it looked like it did not exist, yet it was brightly colored and indescribably beautiful at the same time.

The true body of the Void Flower! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

That flower that brightened the skies and was endlessly colossal was only an image that the Void Flower had produced as a reflection through space.

There was merely about a mile’s distance, and the space surrounding the Celestial Flower was unstable and collapsing. It was possible that a black hole could form at any time.

The Void Flower could be seen, which meant that it had grown fully, and had bloomed brilliantly, which would be followed by wilting. This kind of Celestial Flower would not produce seeds at all. It was born directly from the Regulations of heaven and earth. Even a supreme Celestial King would not be able to grow it.

It was not just Ling Han. Those Demon Masters also appeared in the proximity, all their eyes burning.

Aside from Ling Han and the Empress, there should be nobody else that knew of the origins of the Void Flower, yet everyone could deduce that this flower was extraordinary, so they naturally would use all their methods to snatch it.

“If you don’t want to die, scram!” a Demon Master exclaimed coldly, using divine sense to communicate his will. At the same time, he showed his cultivation level appropriately—Black Demon!

With this exhibition of power, one-third of the people immediately turned around and left.

A Black Demon was too strong, and they were completely no match for him! That was merely a Saintly medicine, after all, and starting a fight with a Black Demon for it was too unwise.

This naturally was because they did not know that the Void Flower was a Celestial Flower, or they would definitely make an attempt.

“Humph, if I encounter the rest, do not blame me for being merciless!” that Black Demon declared coldly.

“That is the Desolate Clouds Demon Master of Grand Planet!”

“Even among Black Demons, he is a big shot.”

“However, the space here overlaps, and being close at hand may mean the other end of the universe. He may not be the first to obtain the Saintly medicine!”

A great many Demon Masters refused to be misled. Though there were still a few Yellow Demons among them, there was not much difference in terms of speed between Demon Masters. Thus, the first to get the Saintly medicine could completely turn around and leave.

A competition for a treasure was naturally using all the means they each had at their disposal. If it was definite that the strongest person would be the one to succeed, then why would there be so many people entering to compete for treasures whenever an ancient site opened up?

Ling Han was also unperturbed. For the sake of a Celestial medicine, it was completely worth it even if he had to use a power boost from the Black Tower.

“Yi, how lucky, I just happened to set out, and I actually encountered a Void Flower!” A voice rang out. Another dazzling young man appeared here. He was dressed in white cotton, and appeared very plain and simple, but one only had to look at the multiple seals glowing on the cotton robes to know that this clothing was a precious treasure.
