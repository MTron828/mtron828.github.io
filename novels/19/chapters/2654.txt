2655 Leaving

“Take them down!” Desolate Moon pointed a finger at Ling Han and Xiao Yingxiong, flustered and exasperated. He could no longer care for anything else.

Pa, pa, pa! Instantly, 10 egg-like structures that could not be destroyed suddenly broke open on their own. Ten Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings stood up from their balled-up posture, each of them exuding frighteningly powerful auras.

They had just been forging towards the height of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and though their progress had now been interrupted, and it was also possible that there would never be another chance for them to become a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, the 10 of them were still peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. With their combined efforts, even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would probably shudder.

However, the eyes of these 10 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were all completely black. The black and white of their eyes could not be differentiated at all, which was extremely eerie.

They were walking corpses, Ling Han immediately thought. They had absorbed Hysteria’s power, but it was also inevitable that they would become walking corpses without any consciousness. They would only obey commands.

This was also why Desolate Moon was needed. He was not only needed as a middle person, he was also responsible for directing these “Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates” to battle. Furthermore, why was Desolate Moon only a Celestial King, and not a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate himself?

It was probably for the same reason.

Xiao Yingxiong laughed loudly. Boom! He unleashed his golden energy endlessly. “Leave. I, Xiao Yingxiong, will stop them here. Not one of them will be able to take one step further!”

Ling Han took a deep breath, and said, “I hope we will meet again one day!”

“Humph, don’t speak as if we are friends,” Xiao Yingxiong retorted coldly. “I only chose to let you break free since your state is better than mine. In truth, I would still be very pleased to cut off your head!”

Ling Han nodded. “I will get revenge for you!”

He did not linger any longer. With so many Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings surrounding them, what time was there left for him to waste?

Xiu! With a flash of his figure, Ling Han immediately raced towards the depths of this palace.

“Take him down! Take him down!” Desolate Moon was flustered and exasperated. If all the Celestial Kings were awakened, he definitely would be able to stop Ling Han, but once the process to break through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier was interrupted, there would never be a second chance.

Scheming for hundreds of millions of years, only for just a few Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to be sent out?

Wasn’t that a joke? Any Second Tier Heavenly Venerate would be able to deal with them easily.

Desolate Moon could only awaken a limited number of Celestial Kings. Otherwise, even he would not be able to bear the consequences. After all, he was presently only one of Hysteria’s dogs.

“Hahahaha, just see how I, Xiao Yingxiong, will kill all in my way!” The present Xiao Yingxiong was even more heroic instead. He waved his Divine Spear. Boom! Golden light was also flashing on the Divine Spear, burning like flames.

10 great Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings rushed forwards, but they were all stopped by Xiao Yingxiong. As golden energy surged out, he was extremely mighty and strong.

Ling Han sighed. This was Xiao Yingxiong’s most dazzling battle. Even if he won, he would still die from over-exhaustion. In fact, it was possible that he would suddenly die in the midst of battle.

On the matter of principles, Xiao Yingxiong had stood firmly, and was worthy of his name as one of the big shots of the World’s Paramount Martial Academy.

‘My respect goes to you!’

Ling Han dismissed his other thoughts. Peng! His Body Art unleashed, and his speed was further boosted. The time that Xiao Yingxiong had won through fighting to the death for Ling Han definitely could not be wasted.

Peng, peng, peng! Behind Ling Han, golden light was clashing with black Qi, accompanied by furious shouts from Desolate Moon. He raced off after Ling Han alone.

It could not be helped. These Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had been interrupted when they had been in the process of evolution, and were like infants. Though they could obey commands, their understanding of commands was not adequate yet. They were told to kill Ling Han and Xiao Yingxiong. They saw that Xiao Yingxiong was closer, so he became the target of their mad offensive. They ignored Ling Han completely.

Hence, Desolate Moon could only set off in pursuit by himself.

He had long since attained the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven, and was a supreme monarch star himself as well. His battle prowess was extremely terrifying, but in terms of pure speed, he might not be a match for Ling Han. Furthermore, he had started off later, and there was a long distance between himself and Ling Han still.

Yet Ling Han did not dare to be the slightest bit careless. If Desolate Moon caught up to him, and he released another dozen Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, then even if Ling Han burst out with the Five Elements Lightning Technique, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to break out of their siege.

He had to rush back to the martial academy, and report the information that he had found out here. Otherwise, what would Xiao Yingxiong’s sacrifice have been for?

This level was the highest level of the palace. There was no 34th level. When Ling Han arrived at the end of the palace, he saw a black door of light appear ahead of him, with black Qi twirling around it.

Was this the path to leave this place?

Ling Han paused slightly, looking hesitant.

Boom! A terrifying aura spread out towards him. Desolate Moon had already caught up to him.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. Whether it was or was not, he had to get a move on.

Xiu! With a leap, he entered into the doorway of light. Instantly, his figure was close to vanishing.

Desolate Moon arrived. He, too, stopped, and showed a hint of hesitation in his expression.

“Though Lord Hysteria has opened a passageway, the exit’s position has not yet been adjusted. Even if this brat can escape, it is still a question of where he would appear. Perhaps, by the time he returns to the martial academy, I will have already completed my mission here.

“Should I pursue or not?

“The evolution has begun, so there is actually no need for me to stay on guard here.

“Just in case, I had better pursue!”

He took a step, and entered the black doorway of light as well. Xiu! His figure vanished immediately as well.

***

Boom! A powerful pulling sensation assailed Ling Han, bringing him great pain. This indeed was a spatial passageway that could allow him to leave the Celestial King Graveyard, but that was designed for Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. For Ling Han to traverse this passage at present naturally caused him great suffering.

Energy mercilessly sliced towards him. Even if he was channeling the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, it was still useless. He would be wounded at the slightest movement, and if he did not channel it, his injuries would become even heavier.

Even Ling Han could not continue enduring. With a flash, he entered into the Celestial Guest Residence.

Crack!

The flow of energy swept past, and furious flames were immediately ignited on the surface of the Celestial Guest Residence. Seals lit up, and then dimmed rapidly again.

Thankfully, this was Divine Metal, after all, and could resist the energy flow.

It wasn’t clear how much time had passed. Peng! The Celestial Guest Residence was shot out, and streaked through the air before landing in a grassy meadow.

Ling Han’s figure appeared. His eyes swept over the surroundings. This was a plain, covered by green meadows.

‘I have left,’ Ling Han immediately thought. This was definitely not the Celestial King Graveyard. The vibe here was completely different.

Ling Han leaped up, and immediately raced off. Who knew when Desolate Moon would come out.

He’d take a look to see where he was, and how far he was now from the martial academy.

His speed now was shocking, and with long-lasting stamina, it was more suitable for long-distance travel, making him capable of powerful bursts of speed. This was practically perfect.

“No wonder Heavenly Venerates are so strong. That is because what they are using is their own power, which is unlike Celestial Kings, who need to undergo a process of drawing on the power of Regulations,” Ling Han murmured as he kept running. At this time, he did not dare to absorb any Void Particle Energy. If his body exploded, who knew how many years he would need to recover.

“I will enter into seclusion after I return, and boost my Body Art to the pinnacle of the Seventh Heaven before I come out again.”

Mountains and rivers were continuously left behind as Ling Han ran past them. After half a day of running, he finally discovered a large city, and directly exuded a great aura as he descended.

The strongest in this city was only a Fifth Heaven Celestial King Tier. When they saw the seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around Ling Han, they hurriedly rushed forward and addressed him as senior very respectfully.

“What city is this? And how far is this city from the World’s Paramount Martial Academy?” Ling Han asked. The reason why he had directly revealed his proof of identity as a Seventh Heaven Celestial King was so that he could save some time.
