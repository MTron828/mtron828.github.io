Chapter 1056: Coming of War

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What little comrades?” Ling Han was at a loss.

“Like Lin You, Ma Xing...” Li Weiwei counted on her fingers. “Of those who entered into the Shattering Void Tier Division with you, all men were collectively challenged yesterday, and are all now black and blue.”

“What is going on?” Ling Han’s expression darkened.

Li Weiwei nodded, and replied, “I am guessing this was done by Sha Yuan, because the fathers and grandfathers of these students are all the subordinates of the Great General Sha.”

“... Can’t you speak more clearly?” Ling Han sighed.

“Why are you so stupid!” Li Weiwei uttered in irritation. “It means Sha Yuan sent his subordinates where Lin You and the others were staying yesterday, and forced them to spar. They are all members of the Shattering Void Tier Division, so no one can stop it.”

“Those subordinates of Sha Yuan had entered the Shattering Void Tier Division quite a number of years ago, and are much stronger than Lin You and the others. Naturally, Lin You and the others were all beaten black and blue.”

Ling Han rubbed his chin. Was this move of Sha Yuan a show of force intended for him?

He had sent Liu Ying and the other guards to assassinate him, which resulted in failure. Now, he did not dare make a move on him in public, so he vented his anger on Lin You and the others?

“There’s nothing that could be done. Who asked you to already be in the medium extreme? So, you can’t possibly seek those people out for revenge.” Li Weiwei sighed.

In the Scarlet Heaven Academy, students in the same division could freely spar with each other. As long as no crippling injuries or fatalities occurred, the Academy would not pursue their responsibility. However, higher-level disciples could not make a move on lower-level disciples unless it was the latter who provoked them first.

Thus, Ling Han could only watch helplessly.

“Hehe, not necessarily.” He smiled, and said, “There should also be Sha Yuan’s subordinates in the Medium Extreme Division, right?”

Li Weiwei was instantly excited, and asked, “You want to thrash those people?”

Ling Han replied, “Since it was Sha Yuan who first did not follow the rules, and expanded the flames of conflict onto innocents, why should I care?”

“All right, I will prepare the namelist for you!” Li Weiwei was the type to wish for the whole world to be in chaos, so she was naturally very cooperative. Immediately, she ran off to compile the list.

In this aspect, her efficiency was really very high. In a mere day’s time, she had already collected all the names of Sha Yuan’s subordinates.

Ling Han held the namelist, and began to continuously issue challenges in the Medium Extreme Division.

Not only in the Northern Institution, but also in the other three Institutions.

He now had the cultivation level of the late stage of the medium extreme, and his normal battle prowess directly soared to the peak stage of high extreme. If he used the Fast Technique and the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, his battle prowess would be boosted by another star!

This was naturally enough to sweep all contenders aside. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even the Academy was alarmed, and issued a strict order, banning Ling Han and Sha Yuan from involving other students in their personal conflict. Only then was the situation contained.

‘Sha Yuan, Zhao Lun.’

Ling Han swore that when he possessed enough strength, he would definitely slay these two people!

Ling Han was now earnestly preparing to return to the Great Ling Empire. After leaving for more than a year, he, too, missed his three elder brothers. He would bring the cultivation resources back and boost the overall strength of the Great Ling Empire.

However, right at this moment, a big piece of news exploded.

...A war had begun between the Golden Lion Nation and Eastern Rain Nation.

Golden Lion Nation was a vassal state of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, whereas the Eastern Rain Nation was a vassal state of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. The two nations bordered each other, and could be considered the buffer area between the two great Majestic Empires, having great strategic significance.

Thus, the two Majestic Empires placed high importance on these two small nations.

Now, a war had erupted between the two. Furthermore, 14 cities of the Eastern Rain Nation had been lost to the other side in a single night, with close to a quarter of its territory occupied, so it was forced to ask for help from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

Empress Luan Xing immediately issued an imperial decree. The Ninth King would lead an army comprised of the students of the Scarlet Heaven Academy to assist.

Why was it the students of the Scarlet Heaven Academy?

Firstly, though these students were geniuses, they had not gone to the battlefield before, and were thus incredibly fragile, but what the Empire needed were soldiers that could fight a hard battle. Hence, they could take this chance to train them well.

Secondly, the students of the Scarlet Heaven Academy were only in the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier at most. Even if they joined the battlefield, it would not make the conflict escalate. Otherwise, if they invested forces that were too powerful, it might induce an all-out conflict between the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire and the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

Thirdly, since the disciples of the Academy were geniuses, their battle prowess was naturally not weak. This was a troop that could not be underestimated.

Since the empress had issued an imperial decree, it was natural that no one would dare disobey. All of a sudden, the whole Academy was mobilized.

Aside from the Shattering Void Tier Division and the Alchemy Institution that did not need to participate in the battle, the other students were all registered to join the battle.

Though war was cruel, it was also a means to quickly boost their status.

The empire had a law proclaiming that anyone that could kill 10,000 enemies would be bestowed with the title of a ninth-rank military general 1 !

Who did not want to excel?

All the young people prepared for war. In their eyes, they were all geniuses, so wasn’t it a piece of cake for them to join a battle and kill enemies? None of them had considered the possibility that they could die in battle, and were all incredibly optimistic.

Ling Han, though, had fought his way all the way from a small world, and deeply knew the cruelty of war. There would be no one to fight you in a one-on-one battle. On the battlefield, arrows and blades would be dancing madly. In a moment of carelessness, they would be hit. Against 10,000 enemies, they could possibly die in an unfathomable manner.

What he did not understand was: why would Empress Luan Xing send the Ninth King to lead the troops?

It was not that he was looking down on Hu Feiyun, but this woman completely did not know how to fight a war. Her own battle prowess was also worrying, so allowing her to lead the troops wasn’t really a joke, was it?

But who could change the mind of the empress?

After three days’ preparation, the army set out.

“Young Master Ling Han, the Ninth King seeks your presence!” They had just exited the city gates when a female guard ran over to look for Ling Han. She brought him to the central area of the army, where a luxurious carriage was.

This was the private vehicle of the Ninth King. It was as big as a mobile courtyard, fully exhibiting the lavish extravagance of the Imperial Clan.

In front of everyone’s envious eyes, Ling Han entered into the carriage.

He looked, and hey, not only was Hu Feiyun here, even Shui Yanyu was present.

“Ling Han, it’s been a long time!” Hu Feiyun greeted him warmly. “After I returned, I was forced into seclusion by Big Sister. I just came out of seclusion a few days ago, and Big Sister has sent me to war. Thankfully, you guys will be there beside me.”

Shui Yanyu was currently sipping tea, and tossed a strange look at Ling Han.

Her underlying message was: ‘You damn pervert, you have again hooked another girl!’

Ling Han bemoaned how wronged he was internally. He did not have the slightest interest in Hu Feiyun. Furthermore, this Ninth King was a bit ignorant, so she probably did not know what love was. She had only been too lonely all this while, so she wanted someone to accompany her to talk and chat.

He took one look at Hu Feiyun, and couldn’t help but look stunned.

High extreme!

This girl actually advanced into the high extreme of Mountain River Tier, a minor level higher than even him.

‘Hiss, what divine pill have you taken that the rate of your advancement is so fast?’

It had to be known that Ling Han had harmonized with the essence of a Demon Master, so his was cultivation level rapidly increasing at all times, and had cultivated the Universal Eight Desolation Technique! But even so, he had only been able to advance a sub-minor level after a few months. How could Hu Feiyun have such exaggerated improvement?

First, it was Zhao Lun, and now, there was Hu Feiyun. Indeed, it seemed that elites of Heavenly Body Tier had astounding means, and could so rapidly boost the cultivation level of a cultivator...!
