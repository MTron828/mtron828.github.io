2788 Crevice in the ground

24,000 meters, 27,000 meters.

When they got here, several more people were eliminated from the race, leaving only Geng Xuandan, Shi Zhonghe, Shi Mengyu, Ling Han, and the Empress.

“Hmm?”

Geng Xuandan, Shi Zhonghe, and Shi Mengyu also looked at Ling Han and the Empress in surprise. These two people actually hadn’t used any Heavenly Venerable Seals so far; both were entirely supported by their own power.

It would seem that they were just like them too.

‘Then let us see who will be able to last till the end.’

Everyone continued to dive, but the pressure was great indeed in the last 3000 meters. Not only had it reached the Second Tier, it was at its late or even peak stage, so much so that the Empress had to channel the Heavenly Venerable Seal to resist this formidable pressure.

There was no way about it, as the Empress was only at the early stage of the First Tier, and it would be impossible for her to contend against someone with the battle prowess of late-stage Second Tier without using a secret technique. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was not only the Empress. Geng Xuandan, Shi Zhonghe, and Shi Mengyu had also channeled Heavenly Venerable Seals. Otherwise, they would not be able to withstand such pressure.

It was important to note that Geng Xuandan, Shi Zhonghe, and others had been here for many years, and their cultivation level had to be at the peak stage. Based on such a comparison, it could be seen that the Power of Dimension that they could accommodate wasn’t much more than the Empress.

They finally fell onto the bed of the lake. Upon observation, there was nothing here but ruins, with traces of the aftermath of battle all over the place.

There were a lot of corpses here, as big as a mountain and lying horizontally, and people couldn’t see past them at all. Some were the size of ordinary people, but the aura which they emitted wasn’t weak at all, causing one’s heart to throb with trepidation.

These were the corpses of Third Tier Heavenly Venerates. After countless years, their bodies hadn’t rotted at all, and it was like they had just died, with the wounds on their bodies still having traces of blood.

What about the Heavenly Venerable Seal?

They searched everywhere, but there was no trace of the Heavenly Venerable Seal anywhere.

Yi, it could be seen from the surface of the lake before, so why couldn’t it be found anywhere now?

“The Heavenly Venerable Seal isn’t something that can be seen at all times, but will only be seen after the waves rise up on the lake so we’ll have to wait for a little longer and see,” Ling Han said to the Empress.

The Empress nodded. Indeed, the appearance of this Heavenly Venerable Seal required certain conditions to be met.

They waited, but no one could keep channeling the Heavenly Venerable Seals for a long time, so Ling Han asked the Empress to head ashore first. After the Empress left, Geng Xuandan and the others followed suit as it was pointless to stubbornly persist.

Ling Han was still walking about at the bottom of the lake. Firstly, he wanted to examine it in detail, and secondly, it was to find out if there were any Heavenly Venerate Tools.

Years ago, there were many Third Tier Heavenly Venerates here, and it wouldn’t be strange at all for them to possess Heavenly Venerate Tools.

Ling Han kept searching, but Heavenly Venerate Tools cultivated by the Third Tier Heavenly Venerates had naturally developed consciousness, and once the owner had died, they would leave by themselves, perhaps directly transforming into Dao, turning back to their original form, or waiting for a new owner to refine them again, to once again fight for another lifetime.

There were also others that roamed around the world. One day, perhaps they might be capable of developing true intelligence, and gaining a real life of their own.

Therefore, unless a Heavenly Venerate Tool had been blown up, it would be extremely difficult to find the existence of a Heavenly Venerate Tool.

However, the problem was that a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate was not yet capable of destroying a Heavenly Venerate Tool. This was something that could only be done by a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, at least.

Ling Han was feeling regretful there, but had no idea that those people on the surface of the lake were about to go crazy.

Was this guy really human?

Other people had gone all out, and could only sustain the pressure by channeling Heavenly Venerable Seals. However, there were only a few Heavenly Venerable Seals, so how long could they keep channeling these seals?

But how long had Ling Han remained below? Moreover, he didn’t even channel any Heavenly Venerable Seals at all, yet he was able to do something that other people couldn’t. Wouldn’t others be shocked by this?

Just how strong was this guy?

After Ling Han made two turns, he found a crevice in the ground.

This crevice in the ground was quite extraordinary. Despite the water pressure being so strong, there was no water seeping in. Ling Han wanted to go in, but found himself being hit with a strong pressure, which immediately slowed him down. After that, he felt as if he was proceeding in a muddy swamp, and couldn’t move another step forward.

‘Could it be that below is the real tomb of the Heavenly Venerate?’ The Heavenly Venerable Seal had also seeped out of this crevice in the ground, so it was incomplete, and coupled with the turbulence of the lake, it became blurred.

Ling Han kept trying, wanting to enter the crevice in the ground, but every time he squeezed forward a bit more, the pressure would increase by a bit more. It was as if there were 10 Third Tier Heavenly Venerates joining forces to stop him at the beginning, which was then increased to 15, 20, and 50, and even Ling Han couldn’t hold on any longer.

He shook his head and returned to the shore.

“Yi, what’s wrong with you guys?” Ling Han looked around, and saw that most of the people stared at him with astonishment, as if he had turned into some kind of monster.

Everyone was speechless. ‘Do you know what you have done?’

He was so powerful it was unbelievable.

Ling Han explained the situation, and everyone’s face revealed their excitement. If they could get inside the crevice in the ground, then they might be able to obtain that Heavenly Venerable Seal.

Yuan Yinglong and the others were also very excited. Although they had previously felt apprehensive, they could also see the benefits now.

Ling Han cast a sweeping glance at them. He didn’t hide such news from them, because he had promised Yuan Yinglong that they would move together. But he had also seen the shortcomings of Yuan Yinglong, which made Ling Han unwilling to associate with the other party.

This would be the last time, and it could be regarded as repaying Yinglong’s previous favor.

At this moment, everyone would just have to wait.

Another 10 days passed, and everyone noticed that there was a dazzling light soaring into the sky from the bottom of the lake. Thereafter, the water level began to drop again.

It didn’t take long for the lake to completely disappear, leaving no trace of the water. If you stood at the bottom of the lake and looked around, this would be just a huge plateau.

“Let’s go.”

Everyone descended one after another, all wanting to seize the opportunity.

Ling Han and the others also took action, jumping towards the bottom of the lake.

There were a large number of Third Tier Heavenly Venerate corpses here, and they had formed an astonishing pressure of supreme might. This wasn’t power, but a kind of suppression upon divine sense. Therefore, other than Third Tier Heavenly Venerates who would remain unaffected, whether it was First Tier or Second Tier, they would certainly feel a kind of pressure.

There was no need to speak about the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates or the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings; they wouldn’t be able to bear it at all.

With a clear goal in mind, everyone headed towards the crevice, and soon arrived at the destination.

Ling Han leaned forward to take a look, and sure enough, the pressure around the crevice in the ground had disappeared.

“Thank you.” A voice was heard from behind him.

Ling Han turned his head, and saw that it was Geng Xuandan.

...

“What is there to thank me for?” Ling Han asked.

“Thank you for finding this entrance for me,” Geng Xuandan said.

Ling Han laughed out loud. “Do you think you can take advantage of me?”

“Don’t think that your battle prowess is superior to mine just because you gained some upper hand before,” Geng Xuandan said lightly, seemingly very confident.

“I also offer my thanks.” Another person appeared.

Cheng Guangqi.

Shua, a third figure landed. It was Shi Yuyuan.

Subsequently, more elites also came over, such as Shi Mengyu, Shi Zhonghe, and several elites from the fifth level. All of them were staring at Ling Han coldly.

Even if they were not Ling Han’s match in this special place, the Heavenly Venerable Seal was possibly right in front of their eyes, so who would possibly retreat and give it up?

“Hehe, there’s no need to start a conflict at this time, right?” Shi Mengyu played mediator. “In any case, when the Heavenly Venerable Seal has just come into being, everyone can try to study it, so why don’t we work together?”
