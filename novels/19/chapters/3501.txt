Chapter 3502: Not giving face

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han acted as if he had not heard anything, and asked, “Why has Your Imperial Highness come to visit today?”

The Third Imperial Prince instantly felt an urge to make a move. However, he was only in the Enlightenment Tier, and not some innate Divine Physique or whatever. His battle prowess was only at the peak stage of the Enlightenment Tier. If he really fought with Ling Han, it would be difficult to gain any advantage.

Thus, he suppressed the fury in his heart, and said calmly, “Your Foreign Affairs Department has just been established, and should be short of manpower. Coincidentally, there are two talented people under me, and I have deliberately come to deliver them to you.”

He waved his hand, and said, “Zhang Hu, Liu Qi, come in and greet the two Department Chiefs!”

As his words fell, two men walked in from outside. They were both in their thirties. They first bowed respectfully towards the Third Imperial Prince, then clasped their hands towards Ling Han and Princess Bixiao, and said, “Greetings, Department Chiefs.”

Their meaning was very clear. Even if they joined the Foreign Affairs Department, they would first have to listen to the Third Imperial Prince, and then it would be Ling Han and Princess Bixiao’s turn. In fact, they could even obey on the surface and oppose their commands privately.

Without waiting for Ling Han and Princess Bixiao to speak, the two of them stood behind the Third Imperial Prince.

F***, he was really condescending.

To say nothing of the fact that Ling Han didn’t want to take them in at all, even if he did, he would still refuse them entry upon seeing their attitude.

The Third Imperial Prince completely treated himself as the owner of this place, and continued, “Ling Han, there is no need for you to be afraid of the heavy burden that you would place on them. If there is any work, just tell them what to do.”

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “Since Your Imperial Highness has said so, then I shall not be reserved either.”

“Of course.” The Third Imperial Prince finally smiled, thinking that Ling Han had submitted.

Princess Bixiao was just about to stop him, thinking that Ling Han had been speaking so righteously just then, saying that he wouldn’t open the back door even whoever it was that came, but what was the result? He had just casually said a few words, and you are already so terrified.

That’s not right!

A thought suddenly occurred to her. How could Ling Han possibly be such a coward?

Previously, this guy dared to even oppose Celestial Path elites, so there was no reason for him to be afraid just like that.

When she thought of this, she did not speak. By now, she still had some understanding of Ling Han. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Er, Zhang Hu and Liu Qi, right?” Ling Han nodded. “The two of you go out and find Uncle He. He’s in charge of toilets, and has been short of manpower recently. Hurry up and help him?”

‘What?’

Zhang Hu and Liu Qi instantly looked humiliated and furious. They were both elites of Inscription Tier, yet they actually had to clean the toilets. Wasn’t this a massive humiliation?

“What is it? I, the Department Chief, am still unable to command you?” Ling Han asked smilingly. As his eyes swept over them, an indescribable pressure formed, causing Zhang Hu and Liu Qi to feel a tightness in their chests. They were completely rendered speechless.

Within the same cultivation level, the only person who could suppress his opponent with his gaze was probably Ling Han.

As expected,’ Princess Bixiao thought to herself. The Ling Han that she knew was a guy that was sometimes slick, and at other times full of thorns. It all depended on whether you had touched his bottom line.

The Third Imperial Prince flew into a thunderous rage. He was still here, and you are not going to give him any face at all?

This was a public mockery of him.

“Ling Han, what is the meaning of this?” he asked balefully.

Ling Han spread out his hands, and said, “Nothing much. I want to make the most of everything. As the Department Chief, I naturally have to consider how to make the most of everyone’s usefulness.”

“So, you’re telling my men, two Inscription Tier elites, to do such a lowly thing?” The Third Imperial Prince became more and more furious as he spoke.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Your Imperial Highness, since these two people have entered into the Foreign Affairs Department, they are now members of the Foreign Affairs Department. How I use them is naturally my own decision, and there is no need for Your Imperial Highness to worry.”

“How dare you!” The Third Imperial Prince slammed a hand on the table, and suddenly stood up, “Ling Han, do you really think that just because you have gained an important position from my Imperial Father, you can look down on everything else, and not take me seriously at all?”

Ling Han was surprised, “Why do you say that, Your Imperial Highness?”

F***, y0U actually still dare to pretend?

“Ling Han, you have gone too far!” The Third Imperial Prince humphed, “I will report this to my Imperial Father. You only choose to employ those who are personally close with you, and this kind of poisonous tumor must be removed!” “Are you done?” Ling Han asked calmly. “If you’re done, then please leave. The main doors are behind you, so please take your leave.”

“You—” The Third Imperial Prince was only trying to scare Ling Han. He had not thought that Ling Han would not fall for this trick at all, which made it impossible for him to stop halfway.

Right now, Ling Han was like the most popular person in front of Chen Fengyan. Who could stop him?

Thus, if Ling Han was determined to fight him head-on, what could he do to Ling Han?

Fight head-on?

Putting aside the question of whether he could win or not, even if he did, so what? If this spread out, it would be too humiliating.

“What is it? Does Your Imperial Highness still need me to personally see you out?” Ling Han added.

The Third Imperial Prince was so furious that he did not even bother to look at Ling Han. Instead, he turned to Princess Bixiao and said, “Bixiao, you are the Deputy Department Chief. This position was personally appointed by my Imperial Father, so speak a word of justice!”

Princess Bixiao pretended to be troubled, and said, “Your Imperial Highness, though Bixiao is also the Department Chief, I am only the Deputy Department Chief. If we publicly disobey, His Majesty would definitely rebuke us, and Bixiao would not be able to bear the consequences.”

The Third Imperial Prince almost lost his breath. After all this, even Princess Bixiao was not willing to give him face.

There was naturally no way that he would be angered by Princess Bixiao. After all, he had other intentions towards Princess Bixiao. Thus, he only smiled sheepishly, and said, “Since you find it difficult to deal with Bixiao, forget it. Forget it.”

“Why haven’t you two reported to the toilet yet?” Ling Han asked from the sidelines.

Zhang Hu and Liu Qi were just about to retort, when the Third Imperial Prince waved his hand, and said, “Ling Han, since you are not giving me any face, then I will pretend that I have never been here! Let’s go.”

The reason why he had sent Zhang Hu and Liu Qi in was naturally to plant some subordinates. The power of this department was too great at present, so he could not help but be envious. However, if his subordinates would only be cleaners cleaning the toilets, then forget it.

He could not afford to lose face like this.

He took the lead, while Zhang Hu and Liu Qi humphed at Ling Han in unison, and hurriedly followed.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He couldn’t be bothered to lower himself to the same level as these two people. As long as he could deal with the Third Imperial Prince, then what were these two people worth?

“You are really bold, not even giving face to the son of His Imperial Majesty.” Princess Bixiao shook her head, feeling very rueful.

What did this matter?

In the Genesis World, Ling Han was also very weak at first, but hadn’t he still grown step by step into the invincible Heavenly Venerate?

Now that he was weak, he could keep a low profile, but he could not lose his pride. This was his bottom line.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “His Majesty is completely different from these Imperial Princes, so he wouldn’t reprimand me for this.”

“That may not be the case. After all, they are father and son,” Princess Bixiao said.

“Then we’re still a couple. Aren’t you still calling for me to be beaten and killed?” Ling Han teased. Ever since he hung out with the large black dog, this bad habit of his had not been cured.

Princess Bixiao’s expression instantly changed drastically, and she delivered a palm strike in Ling Han’s direction.

Ling Han hurriedly ran, as he said, “Tomorrow afternoon, we will set out for the Highest Splendor Sect..”
