Chapter 2314 Barging into the Angel Quarters

When Ling Han heard about this, he was naturally extremely displeased.

He had absolutely no intentions to battle for the Foreign Realm, but if he could get a high ranking while participating in the Thousand Academies Tournament, the academy would also offer astonishing rewards. What he was displeased about was this.

Furthermore, You Yuan coveted his woman, and now had come around to cause him trouble. This was also what Ling Han could not accept.

“We will withdraw as well,” the Empress said.

“That’s right. That damn monkey, Niu is going to beat him until he bursts!” Hu Niu was also aggressive.

Ling Han pondered, and said, “Previously, the Angel Race has barged in. This time, it should be our turn.”

“Sure, sure!” Hu Niu immediately clapped her hands. She was a little demon king that delighted in having the world in chaos in the first place, so she naturally supported Ling Han’s plan to commit a “massacre.” “However, this could possibly deepen the conflict between the Angel Race and Demon Race,” Bewitching Maiden Rou said.

Ling Han shrugged. “If they want to fight, they can just go ahead. What does it have to do with us?”

Now that Bewitching Maiden Rou thought about it, he was right. She had been disguising herself as one of the Angel Race for too long, and unknowingly had placed herself in their shoes.

“Then let’s charge over!”

The four of them left the Demon Quarters, and went all the way to the Angel Quarters. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Actually, whether it was the Demon Quarters, the Angel Quarters, the Insect Quarters, or the Holy Beast Quarters, they did not have any walls or gates. It was just that the four of them were located in the four corners of the academy, respectively, with a very great distance separating each from the other.

Hence, the four of them entering into the Angel Quarters was very easily done. It was only when the masses discovered Ling Han, who was a member of the Demon Quarters, that a commotion began.

A member of the Demon Quarters had actually barged into the Angel Quarters.

This was a provocation!

Instantly, multiple angels walked out. A great many who had gotten the news also appeared, all of them standing on the streets, and staring at Ling Han coldly.

No one dared to make a move. Who did not know that Ling Han was an Eighth-Lotus-level Monarch Star? Furthermore, the Angel Quarters only had a total of three Eighth Lotus monarch tiers. If they did not move, who would be able to stop Ling Han?

Right, they forgot to count the Empress and the others in, but judging by the intimate manner in which they walked side by side with Ling Han, who could hope that they would turn around to deal with Ling Han? “Ba…” Lu Yuanxin was the first to jump out. After he was humiliated by Lu Yuanxin, there were a great many years he had not dared to step out of his doors. However, he was a monarch tier, after all, and had been earnestly cultivating all this while. Added with how his clan was also pouring all their efforts into nurturing him, his cultivation level improved extremely quickly.

At present, he was an Eighth Lotus Third Leaf!

He wanted revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

Ling Han couldn’t help but grin, and replied, “Good son, long time no see.”

Lu Yuanxin exploded with fury. He was really too furious, so he actually forgot that there was a trap hidden in Ling Han’s name. In the end, he screwed himself over again.

“I’m going to kill you!” He moved furiously. Xiu, his figure leaped out, and charged towards Ling Han.

“Scram!” The Empress’s eyes widened, and a frightening aura surged out. Her delicate hand shot out, and turned into a great mountain that blasted towards Lu Yuanxin.

Peng!

Lu Yuanxin was instantly sent flying so hard like a cannonball that there was no further sight of him.

It should be known that not only was the Empress presently a Fifth Secret Monarch Star, but had also merged the Regulations of the two Realms, so her battle prowess completely surpassed that of any Monarch Star that was her equal in cultivation level. This naturally was incredibly frightening.

A Third Secret monarch tier? Just a piece of cake for her.

The residents of the Angel Quarters were all dumbfounded. Previously, though the Empress had slightly shown her prowess in battle, she had not displayed her full strength. Who could have imagined that her battle prowess would be so powerful?

Furthermore, she was clearly a member of the Angel Race, so why had she chosen to help one of the Demon Race?

“Xing, what is the meaning of this?” Wu Ya also appeared. His eyes were set on the Empress. His gaze held adoration, but at the same time was also filled with confusion and wariness.

The Empress merely swept a cold look at him, and did not even deign to reply at all.

Wu Ya’s expression involuntarily became ugly, and he said, “Don’t think that just because You Yuan likes you, you can simply put on airs in front of me!”

The Empress raised a slender brow, and moved directly. Xiu, she arrived in front of Wu Ya in a flash. She sliced out with a palm, and Regulations bloomed, dazzling and bright.

Peng!

Wu Ya moved to parry. With a slight movement, he already blocked this strike from the Empress, and the latter was still sent flying back about 300 meters.

One was a Fifth Secret, while the other was a Seventh Secret. Even the identity of Monarch Star could not make up for the difference in their cultivation level. After all, Wu Ya was also a monarch tier.

However, Wu Ya’s expression became even uglier. He had sparred with the Empress before. At that time, the Empress had practically admitted defeat directly, so he had thought that the Empress was just a monarch tier as well.

But now that they had traded blows, he found out that the Empress was definitely no monarch tier, but rather a Monarch Star!

Heavens, Monarch Stars were really, really too rare. Even in the entire Hundred Battles Academy, You Yuan was the only one, and it was just this one Monarch Star that had gained the 72nd place for the Hundred Battles Academy in the entire Foreign Realm.

The strength of Monarch Star was clearly extraordinary, and their rarity was the same as well.

Yet now? First, Ling Han had popped up, and now there was another Empress. What was going on here? Even Monarch Stars could emerge in bursts? The Empress returned, and charged back towards Wu Ya. Her wish to defeat Wu Ya was practically an impossible feat, but for Wu Ya to defeat her, he would also need to expend extremely great effort.

“Humph!” Xun Feng appeared. He was stronger than Wu Ya. With his hands crossed behind his back, he emanated an incredible air of confidence.

He thought that he could subdue the Empress in 100 moves. After all, he was an Eighth Lotus Eighth Leaf.

However, because Wu Ya was actually enjoying the upper hand, he naturally would not interfere as well. Instead, he set his eyes on Ling Han. “You are quite courageous, to actually dare to run over to the Angel Quarters of your own volition!”

“What, is this a tigers’ den?” Ling Han chuckled.

“It is innumerable times more frightening than that!” Xun Feng moved angrily. At the time, the three of them had barged into the Demon Quarters, but Lu Yuanxin had been left behind in the end. This had become a laughing matter for the entire Angel Quarters, sustaining the merciless mockery and ridicule of the Insect Race and Holy Beast Quarters, and this time, if Ling Han was allowed to withdraw completely unscathed, the pride of the Angel Quarters would really be lost, and they would never be able to hold their heads high again.

“Damn insect, Niu will fight you!” Hu Niu leaped out, battling fiercely with Xun Feng.

However, there was not much of a gap between her battle prowess and that of the Empress, which was naturally very far from enough to match Xun Feng. The moment they traded blows, she fell into a disadvantage. However, this little girl had already cultivated the Greatest Eternity Immortal Physique, and now that her cultivation level had attained that level, this physique was once again unlocked. She continuously dissolved into the flow of time. At one instant, she would be in the past, and at another she would be in the future, and thus could effectively evade Xun Feng’s attacks. For the moment, there was definitely no risk that she would be defeated.

Everyone was once more stunned at this, their mouths gaping widely.

… This was another Monarch Star!

Gods, there were actually four Monarch Stars in the Hundred Battles Academy. This was practically powerful to a chilling extent. If another 1,000,000 years passed, these four would probably reach the height of Eleventh Leaf, and they would definitely be able to crush the Thousand Academies Tournament by then.

Xun Feng was also numb with shock. Why did You Yuan have such an incredibly extraordinary high status?

That was because he was a Monarch Star!

And now Hu Niu was also a Monarch Star, which proved that she would also be able to achieve a similar status to You Yuan’s in the future. Then, now that he was offending her like this, wouldn’t it be digging a trap for himself?

But now it was impossible for him to stop halfway. He could only grit his teeth and continue. As for how the future would unfold, he did not consider it first. He hoped that You Yuan would have a way to resolve this. Ling Han crossed his arms over his chest, and laughed. “Anyone else wants to stop me?”

The Angel Race exchanged looks, and no one made a sound. Whoever stepped up would only be asking for their own suffering, right?

“How truly arrogant.” A voice rang out, menacing and icy.
