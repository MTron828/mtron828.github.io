Chapter 1214: Who Else Wants to Harm Niu’s Ling Han?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The silver river flowed around Yang Hao’s body, and there were countless great stars flashing within it.

Eternal River Tier elites could crush Heavenly Body Tier elites—this wasn’t just empty talk. In fact, this notion was evident simply by looking at the silver river. Countless great stars orbited within it, and it was clear that the power of Eternal River Tier elites was miles ahead of Heavenly Body Tier elites.

Yang Hao immediately regained his composure. Now that his master had stepped in, no one could do him any harm!

Kill him? What a joke!

However, he was extremely curious about the young girl’s identity. She was far too powerful, so much so that Venerable Trinity had to step in to protect him. She was so young, yet she was already so powerful. If he could marry her... Flames of greed and lust burned in his heart.

This girl was breathtakingly beautiful, and she was also astoundingly powerful; how could he not be attracted?

Meanwhile, Hu Niu casually swung a fist at him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Pa!

The silver river shattered into pieces, and all the great stars within it exploded into shards.

Boom, boom, boom!

A brilliant light soared into the sky.

‘What?!’

Yang Hao’s feeling of lust instantly transformed into a feeling of boundless terror. Venerable Trinity had unleashed his silver river to protect him, yet this silver river had been shattered by a casual punch from the young girl.

It was clear that Venerable Trinity was no match for her!

The strength of the young girl was already on a mythological level.

Hu Niu reached over and plucked Yang Hao up. She cocked her head as she looked at him, and then said in a strange voice, “You look so ugly, yet you still dared to oppose Niu’s Ling Han. What a retard!”

Pa!

Venerable Trinity slumped onto the ground. Under this powerful force, a fissure instantly appeared on the already unstable main peak. This fissure ran all the way from the top of the peak to the foot of the mountain.

Boom!

The entire main peak collapsed to the ground.

This was utterly terrifying. Hu Niu hadn’t targeted Venerable Trinity, and she had simply shattered his defenses with a single punch. However, the shock waves from her attack had caused Venerable Trinity to lose control of his body and sit heavily on the main peak, resulting in its collapse.

Rumble!

Heaven and earth were collapsing, yet the onlookers were all frozen like statues. They were pelted by the violent rain of crushed rocks, yet it was as if they couldn’t feel anything.

They were transfixed with pure shock.

In the beginning, everyone had thought that Hu Niu was at the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier. It was because of this cultivation that she had been able to trample Yang Hao unconscious.

However, after she defeated Gao Huang and Yang Hao, everyone speculated that she was at the Heavenly Body Tier, yet Hu Niu immediately went on to insta-kill two elites at the peak stage of the Heavenly Body Tier. Everyone’s evaluation of her cultivation naturally rose again, this time to the Eternal River Tier.

However... it was abundantly clear that this wasn’t her true cultivation!

She hadn’t targeted Venerable Trinity with her punch, yet Venerable Trinity had slumped to the ground anyway.

She had a crushing advantage over Venerable Trinity!

Was she at the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier? Or high extreme? Or... consummate level?!

“G-Genesis Tier!” the Venerable Trinity stammered in shock. He had witnessed a battle between a Demon Master and a Saint on the Two Realm Battlefield. They had possessed a power that could obliterate the world.

Saints possessed the power of creation, while Demon Masters possessed the power of destruction. Neither power was superior or inferior, and their quality was simply dependant on their wielder.

Pu!

Everyone’s mind became numb with shock. This young girl... was actually a Saint!

Saints were the most powerful beings in the world; they were invincible!

‘F*ck!’

“Master!”

“Venerable Trinity!”

Numerous figures streaked toward the collapsed peak. These were the Heavenly Body Tier elites of the Majestic Heaven Sect. The battle here was incredibly intense, and they would be a stain on the name of Heavenly Body Tier elites if they still didn’t react to the commotion.

However, they were all stupefied when they arrived.

What in the world was going on!?

Venerable Trinity had slumped on the ground, his hair disheveled and his aura of immortality gone.

Who could force an Eternal River Tier elite into such a sorry state?

“W-what on earth happened?” someone asked in shock.

This was what they all wanted to know. They didn’t dare to ask Venerable Trinity, but they could grab the others and force them to answer. After learning about the current situation, their faces all became as white as a sheet.

If Venerable Trinity weren’t sitting on the ground, they truly wouldn’t be able to believe that someone in this galaxy was actually powerful enough to defeat him.

Genesis Tier Saint? That young girl? How was this possible?

Her Qi and blood were flourishing, and it was clear that she was as young as she looked. She was definitely under 100 years old. However, most super-geniuses could only reach the Mountain River Tier at the age of 100. Even advancing to the Sun Moon Tier would be regarded as incredible. That being the case, how should they regard such a young Genesis Tier Saint?

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Hu Niu naturally wouldn’t care what others thought about her. She ruthlessly slapped Yang Hao, and his face instantly became swollen like a pig. She giggled, and said, “Ling Han, doesn’t he look way more handsome now?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “That’s right, he looks far more pleasing to the eye now.”

Hu Niu smiled happily upon hearing Ling Han’s praise. She was extremely cheerful, and she proudly said, “Indeed! My crafting skills are first-rate!”

Although Yang Hao had been slapped, he hadn’t fainted. He looked at Ling Han, and then he looked at Hu Niu. He felt as if heaven were playing a sick joke on him.

‘How does Ling Han have such a powerful background?’

If he had known this earlier, he wouldn’t have dared to target Ling Han even if someone had given him a Saint Tool.

After all, he had the protection of a Genesis Tier Saint!

He was filled with hate and fury.

In what way was he inferior to Ling Han? His talent wasn’t inferior, and his appearance was even superior. Yet, why was this enchanting and powerful girl deeply in love with Ling Han?

“I was wrong!” he said through gritted teeth. Great beings knew when to yield and when not to yield. If he lived through this disaster, he would definitely grit his teeth and cultivate as hard as he could. He would exact his revenge when he reached the Genesis Tier in the future.

In any case, he could also be counted as a person with strong willpower. Otherwise, who would dare to consider exacting revenge on a Genesis Tier Saint? Just thinking about this was enough to make one cower.

“Of course you were wrong! So, go die!” Hu Niu smiled as she swung her arm.

Xiu!

Yang Hao was tossed into the air by her.

Peng!

A meteor in the sky exploded into pieces, transforming into a vast rain of rocks and metal.

‘This...!’

She had tossed Yang Hao into the galaxy, and he had smashed into a meteor. Moreover, the impact had been so great that even the meteor had exploded into pieces. One could imagine Yang Hao’s miserable fate. He had definitely been crushed into smithereens. In fact, not even a shred of his existence would remain.

This was the formidable power of Genesis Tier Saints. In the eyes of the onlookers, this was an unfathomable power.

“Old geezer, it’s your turn now!” Hu Niu said. She reached toward Venerable Trinity.

Pa!

Her hand wrapped around Venerable Trinity’s neck. Under her overwhelming power, Eternal River Tier elites were like measly ants. They couldn’t fight back at all.

At this moment, everyone finally believed that Hu Niu was a Genesis Tier Saint. Otherwise, how could she possess such formidable power?

Such a young Saint... How could they accept this?!

“W-who are you?” Venerable Trinity asked. He didn’t beg for his life. How could he—or any other person—affect the decision of a Genesis Tier Saint? He simply wanted to know whom he had provoked.

“Niu is Ling Han’s Hu Niu!” Hu Niu cocked her head, and said, “Old geezer, why are you so stupid? Ah, no wonder you dared to target Niu’s Ling Han. So it turns out that you’re a big idiot!”

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

Hu Niu started to slap Venerable Trinity.

“Despicable old geezer, you actually dared to harm Niu’s Ling Han! Luckily, Ling Han is fine. Otherwise, Niu would have become angry!”

Everyone was speechless. ‘You’ve already dominated the Majestic Heaven Sect, okay? Does this not count as being angry?

‘What are you like when you’re angry?’

Of course, no one dared to ask this question. After all, she was a Genesis Tier Saint!

“I’ve played enough!” Hu Niu casually tossed Venerable Trinity into the air. She then threw a fist at him.

Pa!

Venerable Trinity instantly exploded into pieces. Not a single bone of his remained intact.

An innocent smile blossomed across the young girl’s face. Her expression was clear and beautiful, and she asked, “Who else wants to harm Niu’s Ling Han?”
