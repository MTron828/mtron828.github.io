Chapter 1416 All Fooled

Boom!

Like a surge of furious waves, a saintly aura swept through the surroundings, causing an earth-shattering commotion.

The Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor were both drenched in cold sweat. They both had a feeling that as long as the Notionless Saint wanted to, he could completely obliterate them, body, mind, and all. They would die on foreign soil with no proper burial or send-off.

At this moment, they didn’t dare to have any more “miscellaneous thoughts”.

Meanwhile, the Notionless Saint was also drenched in cold sweat. Right now, he was merely using his aura to frighten his enemies. If he failed to frighten them, he would end up frightening himself to death. However, frightening them with his aura wasn’t a long-term plan. After all, his enemies would become suspicious if he was all talk and no action.

A thought flashed through his mind, and he said, “To come across each other is fate. Seeing that you’ve all reached a barrier in cultivation, let this Saint provide you with some guidance.”

Everyone was overjoyed but also extremely curious.

How high and mighty was an Eternal River Tier elite? Yet, he was actually lowering his own status and offering to provide them with guidance? This naturally caused them to feel extremely flattered. Although they were confused, who would reject such an incredible opportunity?

If they knew that the Notionless Saint wasn’t an Eternal River Tier elite, but rather a Genesis Tier Saint, they would definitely become even more stunned. Moreover, if they knew that this Saint had already lost his battle prowess and merely possessed the knowledge and experience of a Saint, they would further become wild with delight. They would definitely capture and lock him up so that they could force all the secret techniques from him.

The Notionless Saint ignored their reactions, and started to offer his guidance, describing and analyzing the barriers and problems that Heavenly Body Tier elites might come across.

The elites listened intently, and before they knew it, all of them had already sat down. Even the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor weren’t exceptions. They could feel a hint of resonance in their bodies, and it was as if they could comprehend the dao of the next tier at any moment.

Of course, there wasn’t anything surprising about this. The knowledge of Saints was far transcendent above the knowledge of other elites, so they could easily trigger resonance within others. However, whether or not one could genuinely achieve comprehension was down to one’s own making and fortune.

It was as if the Notionless Saint had transformed into an enlightened monk and was spreading his wisdom to the masses. Meanwhile, the Heavenly Body Tier elites all sat upright, listening intently to his words. Even Qu Qiuxue and the others unknowingly started to walk over.

Seeing the looks on the elites’ faces, Ling Han couldn’t help but praise the Notionless Saint in his mind. As expected of a Saint. His ability to fool others was truly convincing and effective. If Ling Han wasn’t so familiar with him, it was entirely possible that he would be fooled too.

Blah, blah, blah...

The Notionless Saint continued to offer his “guidance”, and time slowly crept by.

One day, two days, three days...

Heavenly Body Tier elites didn’t need to eat or drink, as their bodies could naturally absorb Spiritual Qi and transform this into energy. Thus, they didn’t need to worry about dying from hunger.

One month, two months, three months...

Time flew by, and the entire Point Star City had already been conquered by the two Majestic Empires. The soldiers from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire had either surrendered or died in battle, with few of them managing to flee.

However, no one dared to disturb this garden, for very obvious reasons. There were so many elites here, so who dared to cause a ruckus?

Anyhow, the Heavenly Body Tier elites were completely absorbed in the Notionless Saint’s teachings. They were blissfully unaware that three months had already passed. In their minds, they had only been listening to the Notionless Saint for just a short moment.

‘As expected of a Saint; he’s truly skilled at fooling people.’

Ling Han didn’t dare to do anything rash, either. He definitely didn’t dare to walk over and kill the two emperors. After all, that would be an impossible task. Even in their current condition, the gulf between their power was still far too large. It would be near-impossible for him to succeed.

The best-case scenario was if the Notionless Saint could drag this on for eight years or even a decade, all the way until Empress Luan Xing exited seclusion.

Six months, one year, two years!

‘Hmm?’

The Eternity Sky Emperor suddenly came to his senses. How strange! He had already focused all of his attention on comprehension for the past two years, so how come he hadn’t seen an iota of improvement? Moreover, this elite was being far too generous, wasn’t he? He had actually accompanied them for two years, providing them with knowledge and guidance?

‘Something’s wrong, something is definitely wrong!’

In the beginning, he had already suspected that the Notionless Saint was strong in appearance but weak in reality. However, he had immediately suppressed this suspicion after being startled by his terrifying aura. Yet, right now, this suspicion was boiling to the surface again, even more powerful than before.

Shua!

He suddenly launched an attack.

Boom!

Countless bursts of flames danced in the air, making him appear like an ancient god of fire.

“Sh*t! Brat, hurry up and save me!” the Notionless Saint hurriedly shouted. He instantly became as white as a sheet. He still had yet to exact his revenge, so he naturally wasn’t willing to die in this place.

Although Ling Han had also been sitting nearby, he hadn’t been listening to the Notionless Saint’s “guidance”. Instead, he had ingested an Exceptional Talent Black Origin Pill every once in a while, using these alchemical pills to raise his cultivation. Meanwhile, he had also kept an eye on the Eternity Sky Emperor and the other elites.

Thus, he was able to react straight away upon seeing the Eternity Sky Emperor launch an attack. He instantly grabbed the Notionless Saint.

Xiu!

He moved the Notionless Saint into the Black Tower.

The other elites instantly woke from the trance-like state.

They had all been petrified by the Notionless Saint’s aura when he had appeared, and the Notionless Saint had immediately started to offer his guidance immediately after that. Thus, the elites had been left with no opportunity to ponder where the Notionless Saint had come from. Only now did they finally come to their senses.

How could a living person have suddenly appeared out of thin air? And now he had suddenly vanished back into thin air?

‘Spatial God Tool!’

Moreover, how could a supreme elite have been frightened away by an attack from the Eternity Sky Emperor?

‘This is definitely fishy!’

“Sure enough, we were almost tricked by you!” the Eternity Sky Emperor said with a cold chuckle.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Oh, didn’t a bunch of fools already fall for the trick?”

The expressions of the Eternity Sky Emperor and Jade Drop Emperor instantly darkened. Indeed, they had already sat here for two years. If it weren’t for the fact that cultivating in seclusion could span for hundreds or even thousands of years, they would have already suffered a resounding defeat.

The Jade Drop Emperor felt even more furious than the Eternity Sky Emperor. After all, he had only come to his senses after the Eternity Sky Emperor had launched an attack. His expression was incredibly dark, and it was as if he had been smacked across the face by someone.

“Die!” he roared.

Boom!

His entire body turned transparent before rapidly growing in size. After growing to a height of 3000 meters, it was as if his body were composed of flowing water. Moreover, this water was still swirling around within his body.

Dao Manifestation!

Boom!

The Jade Drop Emperor’s palm landed, not only enveloping Ling Han but also enveloping the small mountain that rested behind him. Not only was he going to slap Ling Han to death, but he was also going to obliterate the small mountain and capture Empress Luan Xing.

They had already wasted enough time.

Ling Han took a deep breath before also shaking his body and transforming into a giant that measured 3000 meters tall. This gigantic body was formed from his Origin Power. The higher one’s cultivation level was, the larger and more solid their Dao Manifestation would be. Ling Han swung a fist to meet the Jade Drop Emperor’s attack.

Peng!

There was a violent collision, and Ling Han was thrown to the ground like a crashing meteor. He had already activated Tide of the Ages, yet he was still no match for the Jade Drop Emperor.

“Heh!” the Eternity SKy Emperor seized this opportunity to attack. He would kick Ling Han while he was down.

Sneak attack? Ganging up? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Would the Eternity Sky Emperor give a toss about this? An elite—a ruler—like him would do everything they could in order to achieve their goals.

Ling Han had just launched an attack with his full power, so he was currently at his weakest. That being the case, how could he block this attack?

Peng!

He was struck by the powerful attack, and even his Godly bones were unable to withstand the overwhelming power.

Pa, pa, pa!

Like beans being stir-fried, there was the sound of cracking. However, these cracking sounds were deafening as they reverberated throughout heaven and earth.

After all, this was a Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Ling Han bared his teeth and hissed in pain. The power difference between them was far too large! In fact, this strike had almost ended his life!

Right now, Ling Han was truly in a sorry state. His body was already completely mangled, with blood and pulverized flesh covering every inch of his body. It was already difficult to tell that he was human.

Not being instantly killed by the two emperors was already an astounding feat. If he wasn’t even wounded, that would truly be a joke.

The Eternity Sky Emperor humphed as he raised his right hand. He was going to kill this brat once and for all.

A drop of Indestructible True Fluid circulated, and Ling Han instantly jumped to his feet again. At the same time, the gory wounds on his body rapidly healed and returned to normal. This sudden change in events stunned everyone.

“I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Don’t even think about laying a finger on my wife!”
