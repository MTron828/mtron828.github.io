1289 Demented

Xie Donglai’s eyes were focused on Ling Han. He wanted to witness with his own eyes Ling Han’s death, and only then would he escape.

They were both in the Sun Moon Tier, and he was definitely capable of lasting longer than Ling Han. Furthermore, he had deliberately not used his full power, because he did not want to be ganged up on by too many people from the Netherworld. That way, he could calmly watch Ling Han head to his death.

Ling Han naturally discovered Xie Donglai’s gaze. It was so filled with resentment and hatred, like a blade aimed directly at his back, so how could he possibly not feel it?

He shook his head internally. This man’s desire to get revenge on him had really reached the extreme; he would actually sacrifice a whole team of 10,000 soldiers to kill him. But upon further thought, this team of 10,000 soldiers did not belong to his Xie Clan; even if they all died, so what? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Damn it!

A cold sharpness flickered in Ling Han’s eyes. He suddenly turned around, and charged towards Xie Donglai, loudly calling out, “Brother Xie, let us kill the enemy together!” He drew out the Divine Demon Sword, and a murderous aura suddenly shot skywards, like the arrival of the emperor himself.

The surrounding Netherworld elites were all sent flying. There were some who lost their heads, or had severed arms and legs; as long as their battle prowess had not reached the consummate level of Sun Moon Tier, they would definitely be incapable of escaping this calamity.

Ling Han forcefully charged to right in front of Xie Donglai, his eyes narrowed, and a spiritual barrage suddenly shot out.

Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique!

“Wu!” Xie Donglai’s movements instantly paused. Being on the receiving end of this kind of attack to his spirit, he couldn’t help but be affected. However, as the descendant of the Great General Xie, who himself was a top-grade genius, how could he possibly not have learnt a technique to train his spirit?

His spirit was extremely strong. Thus, he merely paused under the Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique, and immediately went back to normal.

But it should be known that they were in the midst of a chaotic battle, and swords and sabers were attacking everywhere. It was only that one instant, and Xie Donglai had received a few strikes. Thankfully, his defensive Origin Power had not dispersed, so he was not too heavily wounded.

“Damn it!” he uttered angrily. At first, it should be him leading Ling Han into a trap, so why had the tables turned on him and it was he who had fallen into Ling Han’s trap? If it were not for the fact that he was strong enough, and his spirit had been cultivated to a sturdy level, he would not have just been wounded with that momentary pause just now.

“Die!” He could no longer suppress the killing intent in his heart, turning his weapon on Ling Han. A golden saber revealed itself, a black aura washing out. It was filled with corrosive ability, making it seem like even the air itself was about to melt.

The Netherworld beings around them all watched in confusion. Why had internecine strife broken out on the other side? However, they did not mind; they just had to kill them both.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Ling Han and Xie Donglai were deeply embroiled in a heavy siege. Not only did they have to stay on guard against each other, they also had to deal with the attacks from the Netherworld. And this was not just one or two strikes. As less and less people from this lone unit of theirs were left alive, the pressure they endured became heavier and heavier.

In theory, Ling Han should have died long ago. He was merely in the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier, so it was definitely impossible that he could last longer than someone in the peak stage of the consummate level.

However, in truth, Ling Han was still very energetic, looking like he was definitely not retreating before he killed Xie Donglai.

This was unimaginable to Xie Donglai. Why did this guy still not die?

“The one who will be dying is you!” Ling Han replied coldly. “For the sake of a personal grudge, you actually sacrificed a whole unit. Being so demented, what right do you still have to call yourself human?”

“Hey, with a whole army accompanying you to death, are you still unwilling to rest in peace obediently?” Xie Donglai brandished his saber in a swift slash. Golden light danced, his attacks very pronounced, but the black corrosive Qi was filled with darkness, forming a powerful contrast.

“You really can’t be saved!” Ling Han did not speak any further. This mind of Xie Donglai was rotten down to the core, and he was completely irredeemable, and there was no meaning in saving him.

Kill!

He used the Divine Demon Sword, and the Lightning Sword Technique was in play. The surrounding Netherworld elites were all sent flying as they were completely no match for it.

If the elites of the Heavenly Body Tier did not move, then even the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier would have to be wary of Ling Han who was wielding the Divine Demon Sword. Of course, if one could still surpass three to four stars of battle prowess on the basis of consummate level, they were still capable of bulldozing Ling Han.

For example, Xie Donglai. As he brandished his saber in attack, Ling Han did not dare take his attacks head-on, but rather used the Star Plucking Step to dodge and evade. In any case, there were many soldiers of the Netherworld here, so he would just use them as shields.

The two of them battled for a long time in the Netherworld’s ranks, and this gradually attracted the attention of Netherworld elites. As a streak of divine sense swept over them, both Ling Han and Xie Donglai felt a full-body coldness.

“Merely two Sun Moon Tiers, and you actually dare charge here!” A large hand descended from the skies, slapping down on Ling Han and Xie Donglai, who were still engaged in battle.

There were various heavenly bodies floating above that large hand, and it was as if the whole heavens were pressing down on them.

A Heavenly Body Tier elite!

Xie Donglai’s expression shifted drastically. He no longer cared about seeing Ling Han die with his own eyes; at this time, his own survival was more important! He hurriedly drew out a divine seal, and slapped it on himself. Suddenly, golden light spread out, wrapping around him tightly.

When he’d returned to the Xie Clan, he asked for another life-saving seal.

Xiu, he immediately turned into a streak of golden light that shot to the heavens.

“You still think of fleeing?” Ling Han had foreseen this. With his own body as a bow, the Ultimate Arrow was activated. Xiu, an arrow shot out, chasing quickly towards Xie Donglai.

The methods of Eternal River Tier were too astonishing; even if it was just a carelessly made divine seal, it had powerful might. If it was only the Annihilating Dragon Star Arrow, it definitely would not be able to catch up to him. Thus, Ling Han directly used the Ultimate Arrow, spilling out all the power in his body in that single instant.

Pu, the arrow was extraordinarily fast. A streak of blood splattered, and Xie Donglai released a terrible cry. Then, he actually dropped down from the skies.

It was unimaginable. Someone in the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier, who furthermore was a four-star genius, had actually been wounded by an arrow shot by someone in the medium extreme! Still, who asked Xie Donglai to only think of running for his life in his rush, thinking that he was completely safe once he used the divine seal? He was naturally going to relax; how could he have imagined that there would be such a divine arrow chasing after him?

However, it was also precisely because Xie Donglai was strong enough, and the divine seal had born him away fast enough, that this arrow only wounded him, and not tore him into pieces directly.

“Interesting!” That large hand fished over, and caught hold of Xie Donglai. Then, it turned back around, and grabbed out at Ling Han.

Presently, Ling Han had lost all strength, and was even incapable of maintaining his “adult” state. With a pu, he turned into an infant. How could he dare face this head-on? With a flash, he entered into the Black Tower.

Without recovering his power, it was useless even if he came back out.

The large hand caught nothing, and a figure rapidly appeared subsequently. It was a gray-robed man. His figure and appearance was all very normal, but his beard was actually made out of multiple strands of meat, which were still squirming around. The mere sight would make anyone shiver[1].

Xie Donglai was currently being held up in his hand. However, he had lost consciousness, all four limbs drooping and blood dripping endlessly.

If he had known that this would be the result, he would not have penetrated deeply into the army ranks with a single unit even if it killed him. He had dragged himself into danger as well.

“Where is he?” The elite with a beard of meat surveyed the scene, and looked surprised. This Ling Han actually disappeared without a trace.

A minor character merely in the Sun Moon Tier had actually managed to disappear without a trace completely without his knowledge?

“Interesting!” he repeated, his divine sense expanding. He was determined to find Ling Han.
