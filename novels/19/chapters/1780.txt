Chapter 1781: Flame control technique

The Fu Clan had a king tier-level heir like Fu Gaoyun, so how could other forces not?

Aside from Bewitching Maiden Rou of the Purity Sect, there was also Qianzhao Tian of Qianzhao Clan, Beiyu Xiong of Beiyu Clan, Lin Fang of the Ancient Rain Sect, and so on. All of them were king tiers of the present generation, prodigies that had attained a flawless severance.

There were some among them that had just advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier, but there were also some that were already supreme king tiers that had reached the peak stage of the fourth severance, their battle prowess being the strongest beneath the Dividing Soul Tier.

Though Ling Han was confident, his present battle prowess could only match a normal severance at the early stage of the fourth severance. Middle stage was forcing it a little, and he would definitely be no match for an opponent in the late stage, what more someone at the peak stage who had achieved a flawless severance.

Not a match, but it was not not so much that he would lose. His physique was the true basis of his strength.

“Hopefully I don’t come into conflict with them, especially that bewitching maiden!” Fu Gaoyun forced out through gritted teeth. Yet, unknowingly, he showed a sliver of longing in his expression. Clearly, this was still an image that had yet to be erased from his heart.

“Qianzhao Tian is here, Fairy Rou, could you please grant me an audience?” A person suddenly leaped out of the battleship, and stood proudly in midair.

This drew the curiosity of others. The name of Bewitching Maiden Rou could be claimed to be known all throughout the world. Putting aside the fact that juniors would be curious about her charms, there were many that wished to keep her as mistress even among the senior generation.

There was a legend that said that Bewitching Maiden Rou was the most outstanding Holy Daughter of the Purity Sect in history, and was also the most enchanting one at the same time. Even the present sect leader of the Purity Sect Nan Suyu’s beauty was slightly inferior to hers.

It should be known that when Nan Suyu had been a Holy Daughter, she had been known as the Highest Fairy. Even a great many prodigies of four-star forces had fallen in love with her, though not one had managed to win her heart.

And even now, when there were more than 100 three-star forces around them, Nan Suyu was still firmly holding onto the position of the most beautiful woman, and only now did it seem like Bewitching Maiden Rou was about to replace her.

She was more beautiful than even Nan Suyu, so how enchanting could she be?

Thus, as long as one had an interest in the area of romantic relations, what elite did not want to capture Bewitching Maiden Rou, and keep her as mistress?

More importantly, how enticing were the words “bewitching maiden”? Who did not want to give it a shot personally?

At first, no sound emerged from the Purity Sect’s battleship. After a while, a woman in white stood at the bow of the ship. She was as beautiful as a divine fairy, and had a kind of bearing that could make one’s heart flutter, and uncontrollably wish to give his all to her.

“This is Bewitching Maiden Rou?”

“She is indeed breathtakingly exquisite, astonishingly beautiful, and very bewitching!”

“Pff, you people really have too little insight. How could this possibly be her! Bewitching Maiden Rou is 100 times more beautiful than she is, and 10,000 times more bewitching than her. I am really about to die laughing!”

Ling Han nodded internally. Though this woman in white was also very beautiful and bewitching, compared to Liu Huaiyu, she could only be considered slightly superior. If even this could’ve made Fu Gaoyun incapable of forgetting about her, reaching the point of even surrendering a Celestial medicine to her willingly, then Fu Gaoyun’s tastes would’ve been really a bit too low.

And it would’ve been very simple if Fu Tonghai had wanted to deal with him. He would only have had to send Liu Huaiyu, and she could’ve completely entranced Fu Gaoyun to the point of forgetting himself with a little effort.

The woman in white opened her mouth, her voice crisp and extremely enchanting. “Our Holy Daughter has said that she is presently studying a secret technique from an ancient period. However, the secret technique is incomplete, and she is unable to distinguish it completely. If Young Master Qianzhao wishes to see our Holy Daughter, you will have to decode these incomplete chants, and then the Holy Daughter would definitely treat you as an esteemed guest.”

Qianzhao Tian paused slightly, then laughed loudly, and said, “All right, I accept this challenge!”

This was a test from Bewitching Maiden Rou. Without you having enough comprehension ability and innovation, she wasn’t even willing to spare the time to see you. And this was also a test that was targeted at the heir of a clan. If it had been anyone else, it was probable that even this woman in white could not possibly have emerged.

The others also felt an inclination and approached, similarly saying that they were willing to accept this challenge.

The woman in white seemed to have been long since prepared, adn drew out a thick stack of papers. She would distribute one to each person that approached.

Fu Gaoyun could not help himself, and went to collect a piece too. When he returned, he said, “I am purely interested in the ancient technique only and want to solve it, it’s not because I want to meet that so-called Bewitching Maiden Rou.”

Everyone chuckled. ‘Who would believe that? You f*cking have an expression that says you are dying to meet your dream lover.’

Fu Gaoyun did not think quietly and earnestly on his own, either. Instead, he had someone write down the incomplete chant again and distributed it to the rest, gathering everyone’s intelligence to help him solve the problem.

Ling Han also approached for a look. This was indeed an incomplete technique, and there were a total of 10 verbal chants. Seven of them were complete, while the remaining three were incomplete. The empty spots had been marked with circles, every letter was represented with a circle, and the most incomplete chant even had a total of seven circles.

Something like technique involved one’s grasp and use of Regulations. The slightest carelessness could cause one to suffer a self-injury, so not even one letter could be allowed to be wrong. Otherwise, it would only be seeking one’s own death.

This was very similar to a pill recipe, and just how many years had Situ Tang and Xiang Yan spent to restore a three-star ancient pill recipe?

More than a dozen hundred million years!

Furthermore, one only had to see whether the alchemical pill had been successfully refined to know if a pill recipe had been restored correctly. It was a different story for a cultivation technique. If you cultivated wrong, then you could possibly become mad. In the best-case scenario, it could cause damage to your life force, and in the worst case, you could directly set off on your way to the Underworld.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han immediately showed a hint of surprise because he realized that when his eyes swept over that chant on the piece of paper, the Nine Heavens Flame released a powerful flicker.

What was going on?

“This is a flame control technique, and that is why it has drawn out the Nine Heavens Flame,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up. “It is one matter for you to obtain the Source Power of the heaven and earth, but exactly how much might you can release is another story.”

Ling Han nodded. This was like how two people were similarly in the Genesis Tier, but one had stronger comprehension ability of cultivation, and could release 100 percent of his strength, while the other could only release 70 percent—there would be a very significant gap in battle prowess of the two.

It was the same for the Nine Heavens Flame. At present, Ling Han could only either release the Nine Heavens Flame or instill it in a certain technique, but he had not purposely developed a secret technique for the sole purpose of using the Nine Heavens Flame.

The ancestral flames of the heaven and earth had not just appeared now. Furthermore, he was definitely not the only person who had gained an ancestral flame. Clearly, there had long since been others among the worthy predecessors that had captured the Nine Heavens Flame before, and had developed a secret technique according to its unique traits.

“The Nine Heavens Flame is an ancestral flame and the source of all fire. This flame control technique has astonishing value to anyone that cultivates the element of Fire, enough to improve their grasp and control of the Fire Element of the heaven and earth a great amount,” Small Tower judged, and then said, “You must get hold of this secret technique!”

WIthout these words from it, Ling Han had already decided to take a peek. However, this was only an incomplete chant, and was furthermore presently in someone else’s possession. It was not something that could be gotten hold of just because he said so.

Ling Han studied these chants in detail, and a strange thing happened. When he read the few complete chants, and then came to the incomplete chants, those multiple gaps actually became letters, automatically restoring the chants.

He had a feeling that this was absolutely correct.

“This Nine Heavens Flame... actually has a connection with the person who has invented these chants!” Small Tower said with some surprise.
