Chapter 1723: Burn

“Me?” Ling Han smiled calmly before replying, “A true man never changes his name, regardless of the situation. I’m none other than the Ding Clan’s Ding Xiaochen!”

Pu!

Ding Xiaochen almost choked upon hearing this. His expression was plaintive and pitiful.

‘Have you become addicted to impersonating me?!’

Although he still hated Ling Han with every fiber of his being, he wouldn’t dare to provoke him even if someone gave him all the courage in the world. Would you look, even the fourth severance grand elders couldn’t suppress him! Ling Han was an absolute freak!

“Junior Ling Han, if you continue to spout nonsense, I’ll be sure to tear your mouth apart!” Ding Hu said, his eyes red with anger.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Old geezer, it’s not that I’m demeaning you, but you’re nothing but trash!”

Ding Hu roared in anger before charging at Ling Han again.

“I’ll stand here and allow you to attack me. It’s your victory if you can harm even a single hair of mine!” Anyhow, Ling Han was already exhausted of Origin Power, so he couldn’t run away even if he wanted to. As such, it wouldn’t hurt to speak more brashly.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ding Hu unleashed his full power, yet his attacks were genuinely ineffective against Ling Han.

“Use the power of Regulations to refine him!” Ding Yaolong suddenly said.

His insight was shrewd, and he quickly discovered the weakness of Ling Han’s physique.

“Understood, Grand Elder!” Ding Hu instantly changed his tactics. He chuckled coldly as the power of Regulations intertwined around his hands that were pressing toward Ling Han’s head. As long as he used the power of Regulations to refine Ling Han’s head, he could directly obliterate Ling Han’s mind and annihilated his soul.

Ling Han’s mind wavered. However, he didn’t dodge, nor did he enter the Black Tower.

Pa!

Ding Hu’s hands grabbed Ling Han’s head.

Boom!

He unleashed all of the power of Regulations contained within his body as he attempted to forcefully refine Ling Han.

Simply put, he was trying to kill Ling Han and have him return to heaven and earth. That way, he would be as dead as could be.

“Old geezer, I suggest that you stop immediately,” Ling Han said with a faint smile.

“Hahahaha! You’re trying to beg for forgiveness now? It’s too late!” Ding Hu said with a sneer. With his hatred toward Ling Han, he wouldn’t stop at this moment even if someone gave him a Celestial medicine.

He needed to vent this anger, and if he didn’t, he would definitely explode with frustration.

“Haiyah, Little Han, you’re truly in a pinch now,” the large black dog shouted. “Do you have any last words? Seeing that we’re friends, Grandpa Dog will definitely deliver your messages to the right people.”

Ling Han rolled his eyes upon hearing this. This large black dog was far too detestable! He chuckled, and said, “Old geezer, don’t stop if you dare.”

“Humph!” Ding Hu completely ignored Ling Han’s words as he continued to unleash his power of Regulations to refine him.

“If you stop, then you’re my grandson!” Ling Han added.

Ding Hu almost vomited blood in anger. How was this brat so toxic? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hahaha!” Meanwhile, the large black dog was rolling on the floor and laughing. With his understanding of Ling Han, he naturally understood that Ling Han definitely had something to rely on. Thus, he wasn’t worried at all.

“Old geezer, you’re truly seeking death!” Ling Han said. With a single thought, he instantly activated his Nine Heavens Flame.

“Your struggle is futile,” Ding Hu sneered. He could sense the flames within Ling Han’s body, yet how powerful could the Flame Regulations of a measly Genesis Tier cultivator be?

Before the power of his Regulations, these flames would be easily suppressed and extinguished!

“Old man, I’ve been enduring you for a long time! Now, die!” Ling Han suddenly unleashed his power.

Boom!

The Nine Heavens Flame erupted from the crown of his head, and directly soared at Ding Hu’s face.

Ding Hu couldn’t dodge this attack.

Firstly, Ling Han had unleashed the Nine Heavens Flame using the power of lightning, so its speed was astonishingly quick. Secondly, the distance between them was far too small, so there was almost no space for Ding Hu to dodge. Thirdly, Ding Hu was completely underestimating Ling Han, so he was as careless as could be.

After all, which Severing Mundane Tier grand elder would treat a measly Genesis Tier cultivator seriously? Although Ling Han had already proved the strength of his physique, this was a completely different matter from offensive prowess.

Thus, Ding Hu only came to his senses, and realized the terrifying power of the Nine Heavens Flame when it was already about to strike his face.

Its power was indeed fairly weak. In fact, he could destroy it with a single breath. However, the Regulations of the Great Dao that were contained within these flames caused him to feel a sense of apprehension. He would definitely suffer if he were struck by this attack.

Ding Hu couldn’t help but feel astounded. How could a Genesis Tier cultivator unleash such an attack?

However, there was already no time for him to ponder this question. Moreover, there was no time for him to dodge, either. He could only spit out a mouthful of extremely pure blood in an attempt to push the Nine Heavens Flame away or at least buy enough time for him to retreat.

This mouthful of blood wasn’t trivial—it was formed from his life force. Thus, each mouthful that he spat would severely harm his body. However, he was left with no option at this moment. He had to spit this blood in order to save his life!

As long as he lived, he could always find a method to recover his life force. However, if he died, then everything would end.

However, Ding Hu was instantly terrified to his core. Although his mouthful of blood had extinguished the flames, a wave of invisible heat still continued to surge toward him, directly slamming into his face and charging toward his divine sense.

“Ah...!” Ding Hu screamed in wretched agony. He couldn’t spare any effort to refine Ling Han anymore. His legs trembled as he stumbled around.

Weng!

At this moment, his divine sense suddenly flew out from his head, resolutely abandoning his body!

‘This...’

Everyone was transfixed with shock.

‘What’s going on?

‘Did Ling Han jinx him?

‘He told him to let go, and that he would regret it if he didn’t do so. Ding Hu didn’t let go, so he’s become like this now?

‘How terrifying! How can there be such a terrifying Genesis Tier cultivator? He can even force a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder into abandoning his body!’

However, this wasn’t the end.

Ding Hu was horrified to discover that even though his divine sense had already left his body, his soul still started to burn. Moreover, these flames were far too terrifying, and they could directly use his soul as fuel to keep burning. Not only that, but the power of Regulations was also completely unable to extinguish these flames.

If this continued, his soul would be directly disintegrated into ashes. At that time, he would vanish from this heaven and earth once and for all.

“No!” Horror radiated from Ding Hu’s soul. After all, everyone would be terrified by this kind of situation, especially those at the Severing Mundane Tier. This was because their lifespan was theoretically infinite, so they more so didn’t want to die.

“I said that if you stop, you’re my grandson. Sigh!” Ling Han then shook his head, and said with a chuckle, “However, you’re far too wilful, so I definitely can’t accept you as my grandson. Better that you die and reincarnate as soon as possible! In your next life, remember not to ignore the advice of kind-hearted people!”

“Junior, hurry up and stop the flames!” Ding Yaolong shouted as he walked over and glowered at Ling Han.

To the Ding Clan, each Severing Mundane Tier grand elder was an extremely precious resource. After all, they could only raise one such elite every hundreds of millions of years. Thus, the death of such an elite would be a colossal loss.

However, Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “This old geezer wanted to seek death, so there’s nothing I can do about it!”

“Then die!” Ding Yaolong roared as he unleashed the Regulations of the Great Dao at Ling Han. He didn’t dare to go near Ling Han anymore lest he suffered the same fate as Ding Hu. However, as a fourth severance grand elder, he could naturally refine Ling Han even if he stood several meters away.

In fact, he was actually being far too careful at this moment. Although the Nine Heavens Flame was powerful, the limit of Ling Han’s cultivation level meant that it wasn’t unblockable. Just then, it was because of Ding Hu’s carelessness that he had suffered such a fate. Otherwise, a Severing Mundane Tier grand elder could definitely block the Nine Heavens Flame if they wrapped their body in the power of Regulations.

However, would Ding Yaolong dare to test this with his own body after witnessing Ding Hu’s soul being mercilessly burned? Anyhow, keeping his distance would only mean using a little more time. However, he would still be able to refine Ling Han to death.
