3001 Flea

In the past, Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate were high and mighty, looking down on Ling Han like they were gods. If they wanted to kill him, they could, and treated him like an ant.

But now? Though Sealed Emotion had already advanced to the Fourth Tier, and this advancement was really astonishingly fast, faced with Ling Han, so what if he was a Fourth Tier? How much stronger was he than an ant?

That Second Tier continued to ask, “What about the others? What did you do with them?”

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said casually, “Killed them all.”

Killed them? All of them?

Everyone was taken aback at first, but then disbelief spread across their faces.

What kind of joke was this? How could over 20 Heavenly Venerates die so soundlessly?

A great battle would definitely have broken out, which would have alerted the entire camp.

‘Who do you think you are? An ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier?’

However, after all, it was not everyone that could not recognize Ling Han, especially those from the current generation of the Genesis World. There were really very few that could not recognize Ling Han.

The supreme freak.

Instantly, everyone began whispering among themselves. The majority were numb with shock. It should be known that over 500 billion years ago, Ling Han had already possessed the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier, so how strong would he be now?

Because Ling Han was too powerful, no one actually dared to make too much noise. They were basically communicating through divine sense to avoid accidentally saying something wrong and angering this guy.

Just listen to what he said. Ling Han had just admitted that he had killed a great many members of the Feng Alliance.

Yi Long immediately jumped up, and shouted loudly, “You madman, just see how I will suppress you!”

Though he was the victim of injustice, for the sake of increasing his own standing in the Feng Alliance, he naturally did not hesitate to jump out of his own volition. Moreover, Ling Han was the main culprit that had caused him to be accused wrongfully. He naturally very much wanted to give Ling Han a beating, or even kill him.

…Though the majority of people from this generation of the Genesis World recognized Ling Han, there were also a few exceptions, and this Yi Long belonged to that minority.

Everyone watched, shaking their head.

Was he seeking death? He actually dared to provoke that bringer of calamity?

Ling Han smiled faintly. “You want to suppress me?”

“Humph, are you afraid now?” Yi Long asked coldly. Actually, he knew that it was likely he was no match for Ling Han, because the technique that Ling Han had used on Huang Feng was something that he could not replicate.

Yi Long was clearly outmatched, yet still jumped out. Wasn’t he showing his loyalty?

Ling Han nodded. “All right, you can make your move. However, let’s make things clear first. I am a person who distinguishes between kindness and hatred. If others do not trifle with me, I will not trifle with anyone, either, but if anyone dares to trifle with me, I will return the favor a hundredfold, a thousandfold. Thus, you will die.”

“Haha, what an arrogant tone. Do you think you’re an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier?” Yi Long sneered. He leaped out, launching an attack at Ling Han.

He was really going all out. Channeling a seventh-grade seal, he was also brandishing a large flag in his hand. This was a Heavenly Venerate Tool, which unleashed a frightening might.

Everyone shook their head. The freakish Ling Han was not as simple as a Seventh Tier ultimate elite; he had even suppressed a Seventh Tier before!

This was like trying to pick a losing battle. Who knew how embarrassing Yi Long’s death would be.

However, none of the members of the Feng Alliance recognized Ling Han. Seeing Yi Long unleash such a powerful offensive, they couldn’t help but feel excited. They all cheered Yi Long on.

Boom, Yi Long had already charged in front of Ling Han. He had no intention of killing Ling Han. Putting aside the fact that he knew that his abilities were inferior, even if he had that kind of strength, he would not do so.

Killing was forbidden in the camp. He had his reservations.

Thus, though this attack was fierce, it left a very great margin from fatality.

Ling Han moved. Peng, peng, peng! Yi Long’s attacks all bounced back, appearing extremely fragile.

In the midst of Yi Long’s shock, Ling Han’s large hand penetrated his defenses, and he immediately already gripped his neck.

Like a duck, he was instantly picked up by Ling Han. He could only flail his limbs weakly.

‘This!’

Seeing this scene, the members of the Feng Alliance all gaped. They had been cheering for Yi Long for so long, yet this was the result?

It was too embarrassing.

The others didn’t find this strange at all. Ling Han could even capture a Seventh Tier ultimate elite, what more a mere Third Tier.

Ling Han looked at Yi Long, and asked, “Do you regret it?”

Though Yi Long was shocked internally, when he recalled that there was still a Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable behind him, his courage was naturally increased. He was sure that Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable would definitely move to save him.

Thus, he declared very arrogantly, “No regrets! Don’t be too arrogant, you—”

Peng!

Before he could even finish his words, he had already turned into a mist of blood.

Ling Han nonchalantly withdrew his hand. Blood sprayed in all directions, yet did not touch him at all.

Wisps of life essence surged into his body, yet there was pitifully little of it. It did not cause the slightest ripple at all.

It looked like he would probably have to kill an ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier if he wanted to see an obvious improvement, but Seventh Tiers were undying and indestructible, and could not be killed at all. Thus, this path had to have been severed.

Of course, this was unless Ling Han could directly engulf dimensions like Hysteria!

Yi Long’s remnant soul danced in the skies, and his spirit would very soon be destroyed and disperse.

He looked at Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, filled with resentment and disbelief. Just now, Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable actually did not even have the intention to move to save him.

Yi Long had died too unjustly.

…Speaking of which, today he definitely had to be the number one fool in history.

Previously, he had been treated as the culprit, and almost beaten to death. Now, he had impatiently charged ahead, not even knowing who his opponent was. Just how unjust was his death?

But so what if he was wronged? Very soon, he completely disappeared.

Watching as a Third Tier turned into a mist of blood, everyone was shocked.

Ling Han actually dared to kill in the camp?

Hiss, no matter how strong Ling Han’s abilities were, there was a bottom line that could not be crossed, and that was to destroy the most fundamental unity of the camp.

Murder was definitely not allowed.

Yet Ling Han did not take it to heart at all. With his present strength, what need was there for him to care about any kind of rules?

He had already made his words clear. If anyone made a move on him, he would definitely repay them a hundred, a thousand times over. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

If anyone made another move, they would have to bear the consequences.

“Sealed Emotion, are you going to commit suicide, or should I send you on your way?” Ling Han looked towards Sealed Emotion. On his list of people to kill, this was one of them.

Sealed Emotion only felt aggrieved. The brat that had not even been worth a mention in front of him in the past could now decide his life or death.

…He didn’t think that he would be able to fortunately escape from the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier.

And if he knew that Ling Han had asked that same question of Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate in the past, who knew if he would feel sympathy from their shared fate, or fume with fury.

He did not make a sound, but rather looked coldly at Ling Han.

At this moment, no matter what he did, it would be useless. The initiative was in Ling Han’s hands.

“Hehe, Ling Han, how mighty of you!” A cold laugh rang out, and an extremely powerful aura surged out. A young man in fluttering white robes walked out.

Feng Wuding.
