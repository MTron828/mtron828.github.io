Chapter 3297 - 3297: Set up a Formation within a Formation

This was setting up formations, how could it be done so casually?

With a wave of his hand, the formations had been set up?

But the truth was so. The seventeen formation foundations linked together, stimulating the power of heaven and earth, and also changing the environment. Originally, this was a battlefield, but from the look of things now, it was covered with clouds and mist, which could be considered a divine miracle.

So impressive, this formation was really formed too quickly.

Even Chen Hao nodded in approval. He had always believed that Formation Masters were no weaker than cultivators in terms of battle prowess. In fact, once a Formation Master unleashed his might, he would be able to stop or even kill a dozen or so cultivators.

The problem was, the more powerful the formation, the slower it would be to set up, and the more it had to be set up in advance.

This was like waiting for the victim to fall into a trap, but if the victim didn’t come, the formations would be useless.

Formation Masters naturally wanted to quickly set up formations, but the more powerful formations were, the longer it would take to set up formations, and for cultivators, this little bit of time was enough to kill Formation Masters several times over.

A Formation Master had spent all his energy on formations, and his own battle prowess was actually quite weak. Thus, a Formation Master was still unable to take on a head-on confrontation. He was more likely to appear as an assisting character, the same as an alchemist.

Of course, there were also exceptions. For example, his Junior Brother, who could set up a formation with a single thought, and could suppress cultivators “at the same cultivation level”. Unfortunately, he encountered General Vajra, a person who had toughened his physique, and because of heavy injury, he retreated from the Imperial Capital, disheartened.

Aside from him, it was Hong Tianbu. Though he was not very fast in setting up formations, his battle prowess was too strong, enough to support him to slowly finish setting up the formations.

However, Hong Tianbu was invincible among his peers in the first place, and in fact, he was close to being invincible even with the gap of a cultivation level between him and his opponent. What need was there for him to use formations to kill his enemies?

It was purely icing on the cake.

But now, he saw a miracle.

Chen Hao’s eyes lit up. He seemed to have discovered a formations genius.

All of a sudden, his heart was leaning towards Ling Han. Zhou He deserved to be beaten. Who asked him to say such words? Didn’t he know that there were Demonic Beasts wreaking havoc and slaughtering many villages? If he said such words at this time, it wasn’t impossible that he would be dealt to be an example for others.

Ling Han’s opponent couldn’t help but gape. With a wave of his hand, the formations were completed, so how was he supposed to win?

Now, he could only depend on himself to break through Ling Han’s formation, and Ling Han would not be able to break through his.

Ling Han had set up a psychedelic formation, which did not have much destructive power. Thus, in theory, as long as there was enough time, he would definitely be able to break through the formation.

However, this was a tournament, so they couldn’t give too much time.

Everyone only had one hour. If they couldn’t break through the formation in one hour, it would be considered a failure.

However, everyone had learnt Elementary Level formations before, and the only difference was in their modifications. Thus, it wasn’t difficult to break the formation in an hour; the main thing was how much time it took.

Formations were different from alchemy.

As long as one obtained the recipe for the pill, the alchemical pill concocted by any alchemist would be the same. At most, it would only be a matter of quality.

For formations, if one set of formations was given to a hundred Formation Masters, they could evolve into a hundred different types.

That was because formations were meant to be deciphered, so there would definitely be flaws. These formations were called nodes. Then, every Formation Master could have their own ideas about where the nodes of the formations would placed.

Thus, even if they knew what formations the other party had set up, it was not easy to find the nodes. If they encountered a killing formation, it was not impossible that they would lose their lives.

That person immediately began to break the formation. He stepped into the formation. If he didn’t test the formation himself, how was he supposed to find the nodes?

After ten minutes, he revealed a smile. Here it was.

He stretched out a hand, and inserted the formation foundations into the dirt. One, two, three. Then, he used his spiritual power to communicate with the formation foundations, and this small formation was instantly activated.

Though there were only three formation foundations, this was called the “Destructive Formation”, and its effect was to cut off the power of heaven and earth. Though it could only affect a very small area, as long as he found the nodes of Ling Han’s formation, then after cutting off the power of heaven and

earth in this area, the entire formation would naturally lose its effect.

He was filled with confidence, but very soon, he revealed an astounded expression, because there were still clouds and mist swirling before his eyes. The formation had not been broken.

‘What’s going on here?’

He deduced repeatedly, and then came to a sudden realization. As it turned out, Ling Han had set up another formation within the psychedelic formation, which affected his judgment.

Something like that was possible?

That person was stunned. The ability to set up formations within formations was something that only a true Grandmaster could possess, and now, he actually saw it from an Elementary Level Formation Master. How could he believe it?

If it was not for the fact that the competition was still ongoing, he really wanted to prostrate himself in worship.

“Yi, I also think that the nodes are there, but why does the Destructive

Formation not work?”

“That’s right, I too think that’s the case.”

“Why is it ineffective?”

Everyone was surprised. As the saying goes, bystanders can see better. Furthermore, there was someone walking around in the formation to test the waters, so they could see more clearly.

A great many people had already discovered that “node” two to three minutes ago, but now, it was actually proven that it was not there, which was unacceptable to them.

“Could it be that that person’s Destructive Formation is not working?”

“It can’t be. Just look, the formation patterns have already been activated, so how could it not be?” “Then what’s going on?”

“That’s actually not a node!”

Even some Middle Level Formation Masters were a little confused, because they too thought that that was the key to breaking through the formations.

Only the High Level Formation Masters immediately saw through it and explained the logic behind it.

“What, set up a formation within a formation!” “It can actually be seen in low-level formations?” “Inconceivable! ”

“Heavens, what kind of awesome person is this?”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In the formation, that opponent wiped off cold sweat madly. There was a

formation set up in the formation. The difficulty level of deducing the location

of the nodes would increase by at least tenfold.

Where, where, where, where?

He kept trying, but still couldn’t find the correct position.

An hour’s time passed very quickly. In the end, he did not succeed.

The opponent’s mouth was filled with bitterness. Even if Ling Han wouldn’t be able to break through his formation, how long would Ling Han need to set up the formation? In this aspect, Ling Han was superior to him.

“l forfeit.” He directly gave up.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Good match.”

In the first round of the competition, Ling Han easily won.

Some lucky people passed the first round and directly advanced to the second round.

After resting for a while, the second round of the competition began.

Coincidentally, Ling Han’s opponent was Yan Jun.

Yan Jun looked at Ling Han, and his heart was naturally astounded beyond belief. Ling Han becoming a Formation Master was already unacceptable to him, and when he saw the speed at which Ling Han set up the formation, as well as the way he set up the formation within the formation, he could only stare in dumbfounded shock.

How could there be such a freak, and one that was his mortal enemy at that!

He hurriedly said, “I’ll set up the formation first!”

Shua, shua, shua! He had already inserted the formation foundations on the sand, and with the stimulation of his spiritual power, the formations were soon activated.

This was a killing formation. Yan Jun’s intentions were sinister. He wanted to kill Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly. You, an Elementary Level Formation Master, actually want to kill a Blood Transformation Tier elite?

Had his brain been kicked by a donkey?

He strode into the formations, then clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out.

BANG!

Yellow sand soared into the sky, and the formations were immediately broken.

Instantly, everyone’s mouths gaped open..
