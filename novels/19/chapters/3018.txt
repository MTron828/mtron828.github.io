3019 Discovery

Ling Han carefully studied his new disciple.

Why did Ning Haixin have such a strong affinity?

While Ning Haixin was cultivating, Ling Han was analyzing this disciple. With his strength, it was naturally impossible for Ning Haixin to discover anything off.

After so many years, he had to have discovered something.

However, this discovery was practically nonexistent.

That was because he had discovered a small dot of light in the depths of Ning Haixin’s mind. It was really very unnoticeable, and he had only discovered it after searching for a very long time.

However, he was unable to detect what lay in the depths of the speck of light.

This dot of light was extremely fragile. If Ling Han forcefully opened it, it would only immediately explode.

Perhaps this would not hurt Ning Haixin, but it might be the key to her having this kind of affinity. Ling Han naturally would not act rashly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

More importantly, as Ning Haixin’s cultivation level increased, this small dot of light was also growing, and Ling Han discovered that her affinity was also growing stronger.

Using himself as a reference, he discovered that Ning Haixin’s influence on him was indeed increasing.

Of course, this kind of increase was negligible, and the effects on him were also pitifully small, almost trivial, but for her to be able to affect a Heavenly Venerate that had the cultivation level of a Fifth Tier, and possessed the battle prowess of a Seventh Tier, what kind of concept was that?

Ling Han was extremely curious. He decided to properly nurture Ning Haixin, and wait for her cultivation level to soar a little higher. At that time, the speck of light would become even larger, as if it was growing healthily. Perhaps he would be able to peek into even more secrets.

100,000 years had passed, and Ling Han believed that those doppelgangers of his should have repaired the dimensions by now. It was time for him to return.

“Let’s go,” he said softly.

“Yes, Master,” Ning Haixin said with a bow. After cultivating by Ling Han’s side for so many years, she was increasingly aware of just how unfathomable this master of hers was.

Now that she thought about it, though Ling Han had saved her from her suffering, he was also the person who had killed her father and brother. However, she only felt admiration and respect for Ling Han, and did not have the slightest bit of hatred.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and forcibly connected the space of the Heavenly Treasures Lake with this place, forming a spatial passageway. The two of them only took a single step, and had already arrived above the Heavenly Treasures Lake.

“Who goes there!” A lake spirit immediately flew out, and when it saw Ling Han and Ning Haixin, it immediately looked excited.

He hurriedly knelt down and respectfully kowtowed.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Rise.”

“Yes, milord,” the lake spirit said respectfully. It was precisely that thick-backed tortoise, Gui Hou.

He did not make another sound, but rather tore a rip into space. Instantly, Void Energy surged out, causing even the skies to change color.

The energy storms from the Void could reach the might of Sixth Tiers, at most. This was only a medium-level dimension. Even at its strongest, it was only equivalent to over a dozen Fourth Tiers, so how could it withstand the energy storm from the Void?

However, there was another power in the world that surpassed Regulations. The rip in space was rapidly recovering, not allowing the energy storm to continue wreaking havoc.

“Come back,” Ling Han said softly.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. Instantly, multiple figures flew out, pouncing towards him, and fusing into his body one after another.

Boom, Ling Han’s power instantly skyrocketed endlessly, and his aura also increased madly.

The entire Heavenly Treasure Lake was boiling, and the water seemed like it was about to evaporate completely.

Lake spirit after lake spirit flew out, and when they saw Ling Han, they immediately knelt down respectfully. Even their hearts were trembling. This kind of great power was really too terrifying.

After a short while, all the doppelgangers had returned. Ling Han closed his eyes and sensed for a while, and couldn’t help but smile.

Very good, all the dimensions had been repaired, and his battle prowess had returned to his prime condition.

As long as he didn’t encounter Hysteria, there would be no one in this world who would be able to hurt a single hair on his head.

“Haixin, is there anything that you cannot let go of?” Ling Han asked.

“There is nothing that I cannot let go of,” Ning Haixin immediately answered.

Ling Han nodded. “All right, then we will leave.”

“Milord!” Right at this moment, a woman in white flew over, and knelt nine meters away from Ling Han. “I wish to follow Milord, and work for you.”

This was White Snake. 100,000 years had passed, and her cultivation level had also advanced further, reaching Second Heaven. Her progress was very astonishing. This should be the effect of her bloodline inheritance. Otherwise, her natural talent in cultivation would not have been so strong.

Ling Han considered for a moment, and then said, “Fine then. Just follow Haixin, protect her, and give her some guidance.”

“Yes, Master!” White Snake was overjoyed, and hurriedly knelt down to pay respects to Ning Haixin. “Bai Ji pays respects to Young Mistress!”

“Aunty Bai, you…” Ning Haixin was a little at a loss for what to do. Since childhood, Aunty Bai had doted on her very much, yet now she was kneeling in front of her and calling her a young mistress, which made her panic.

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively. “It’s fine.”

He was one of the strongest Heavenly Venerates in the world, and Ning Haixin was his disciple. To say nothing of a mere Second Heaven Celestial King, it was normal for even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to become servants. Even Heavenly Venerates would have to treat him with respect.

Hence, from this moment onwards, this little girl should get used to it.

“Yes, Master,” Ning Haixin said.

The lake spirits all looked enviously at White Snake. Though she had become Ling Han’s servant, no, no, no, Ning Haixin’s servant, what kind of existence was Ling Han? As long as there was the slightest bit of relationship, her future prospects would be boundless.

Unfortunately, none of them had the courage to open their mouths and say that they wanted to follow Ling Han and become his servants.

Ling Han moved, and grabbed both Ning Haixin and White Snake. Then, he tore open the Void, and began his inter-dimensional journey.

He didn’t want to return to the Realm Battlefield again. Thus, he took a bit more time, and he once again tore open the void and returned half a month later, appearing in the Profound Negative Realm.

Another nine days later, he returned to his family.

“Ling Han!”

Everyone was overjoyed. Ling Han would suddenly disappear for several million years at the drop of a hat, which would always worry them.

Ling Han asked about Ling Feifan. Fortunately, this brat kept a low profile, and didn’t encounter any trouble. Moreover, he had successfully advanced to the Third Tier, and was currently battling fiercely in the Realm Battlefield.

Ling Han introduced Ning Haixin and White Snake. He did not mention Ning Haixin’s special ability, and only casually mentioned that he had taken her as a disciple.

Speaking of disciples, he felt his conscience ache a little. In all these years, he had not been able to properly guide them.

He began moving, gathering his disciples that were in various places, and even various dimensions.

Chen Ruijing, Yun Yongwang, Kang Xiuyuan, and Jiang Yuefeng were the four disciples he had taken in his last life. There was also Ding Ping, Jiuyau, Fu Tianxing, and Ning Haixin who were the four disciples of his current lifetime. Coincidentally, there just happened to be four veteran disciples and four newer disciples.

Comparatively speaking, the natural talent of his four veteran disciples was too weak. Originally, reaching even Genesis Tier would have been difficult, but now that they had come to the transcendent dimension, and added with Ling Han’s alchemical pills, their limits had also been pushed up considerably.
