Chapter 3482: One Against Eight

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xiong Bao felt helpless and could only exchange blows with Ling Han. Otherwise, if his “vital points” were hit, his defensive energy would drop even faster.

But in this kind of confrontation, the one with the stronger power would be victorious!

With every punch that he received, his whole person would be pushed back continuously, and his defensive energy was plummeting. In merely three punches, his defensive energy had already been completely exhausted.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han attacked repeatedly, and with a single punch, Xiong Bao’s golem retreated rapidly. From the outside, the golem was completely unharmed, but only Xiong Bao himself knew just how terrible his present situation was.

“30% destruction of doppelganger.”

“42% destruction of doppelganger.”

“56% destruction of doppelganger”

“Destruction…”

He continued to receive notifications like this, causing him to feel both anxious and shocked.

If the degree of destruction reached 100%, it meant that the golem would lose its use. He would no longer be able to control the golem, and in this place filled with death light, how would he dare to leave the golem?

He probably wouldn’t die, but he would probably have to wait for the Young Dragon to appear before he could leave this place.

In this Young Dragon Trial, the victor was said to be able to obtain a great fortune. He didn’t want to miss it.

“Ah!” he roared loudly, and rose up to counter.

However, in the face of absolute power, his resistance was like a splash in the ocean, negligible.

In this kind of battle, boiling of blood and Qi was useless, ultimate moves were useless, and Spirit Tools were useless.

“74% destruction of doppelganger.”

“89% destruction of doppelganger.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“100% destruction of doppelganger. You have lost the ability to move.”

Xiong Bao discovered that he could no longer command the golem.

He was done for.

Meanwhile, Ling Han received a reminder that your enemy has already lost his battle prowess, and he no longer needs to attack.

Fine, one of themhad been dealt with.

He turned around, and it was at this moment that Hong Tianbu and the others finally arrived.

He laughed and leaped up again, breaking through the siege by jumping into the air, landing towards Ying Pokong and Hu Taifeng.

Boom!

The two of them shot out punches at the same time, aimed at Ling Han.

‘Tve been waiting for you!” the two of them said.

Ling Han dodged to the side, dodging Hu Taifeng’s fist. Then, he countered with a punch, exchanging blows with Ying Pokong.

Peng, Ying Pokong was outmatched, and retreated continuously.

Ling Han shot out another kick, sending Hu Taifeng flying. Then, he set off in rapid pursuit of Ying Pokong.

On the other side, Hong Tianbu and the others were all in hot pursuit. If Ling Han continued to attack them one after another, they would all be finished.

However, Ling Han had a comprehensive advantage, both in terms of power and speed.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han thrashed Ying Pokong madly, and with a series of Fists of Fury, Ying Pokong couldn’t even parry. Teng, teng, teng, he could only retreat continuously.

And in Ying Pokong’s mind, the notifications he received did not stop either.

Finally, Ling Han also received a notification. Ying Pokong had “died”.

All right, there were only six left.

He set his “eyes” on Hu Taifeng. However, Hu Taifeng had learnt his lesson this time, and stood together with Hong Tianbu and the others.

“Hehe, is this considered sincere cooperation?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Hong Tianbu was instantly enraged. In terms of true battle prowess, he could crush Ling Han with a single finger. However, in the current situation, he couldn’t do anything to Ling Han even after teaming up with others. He couldn’t accept this result.

He charged out alone. Though there was a gap in power between the two of them, he believed that with his own battle skills, he would definitely be able to suppress Ling Han.

However, it was useless.

Previously, Ling Han had continuously practiced the basic movements, grasping the essentials of every punch, palm strike and kick to perfection. In terms of battle techniques, Ling Han was not the slightest bit inferior.

Then, the difference in power was completely apparent. Under Ling Han’s mad barrage of attacks, Hong Tianbu’s golem’s defensive power was quickly destroyed, and the damage was greatly increased.

Thankfully, the others rushed forwards, helping him to resolve his dilemma.

However, the defensive energy would recover after leaving the battle, but the degree of damage could not be recovered. Even if Ling Han was killed by them together, Hong Tianbu would still be in a very disadvantageous position in the following battle.

Ling Han was already confident that victory was in his grasp, and he used his more agile movements to continuously attack those who were on the fringes of the group of six, expending their defensive energy. In any case, everyone was in a state of battle, so none of them would be able to recover.

After half a day, the defensive energy of the six people had more or less been completely worn away.

If this continued, victory would definitely belong to Ling Han.

Hu Er made a prompt decision, and said, “Princess, you go first. I’ll block him!”

Hu Taifeng gritted his teeth, and said, “That’s right, princess, you go first!”

If this continued, victory would belong to Ling Han. Though Ling Han had an unclear relationship with their princess, he was still not the son-in-law of the Demon Race, after all, so he naturally could not yield at this time.

Princess Bixiao hesitated slightly. Then, she turned around and went to break open the doors.

At first, Hong Tianbu wanted to stop her, but after some thought, he decided against it. The moment the doors opened, he would rush out at the first instant, and have Hu Er stop Ling Han.

With Hu Er’s strength, it should not be difficult for him to block Ling Han for a few minutes, and if he had no one to stop him, a few minutes’ time was enough for him to run very far.

—If the end was behind these stone doors, then he would definitely be able to get first place.

Ling Han laughed loudly, “You guys have underestimated me too much!”

He charged out, and aggressively charged over from the front.

Hu Er approached. He was obviously an incredibly heavy golem now, but he actually gave Ling Han a light feeling.

This guy was really extraordinary.

But no matter how extraordinary he was, he would only be defeated in his hands.

Ling Han brandished his fists mercilessly. On the other side, Hong Tianbu, Hu Taifeng, Mei Hua, and Wu Lidong all charged over. They all had the same thought, and that was after the doors were broken open, they would take advantage of the opening to charge out. They would just let the others block Ling Han.

However, Ling Han had already shattered their defenses, and each of his punches was a solid wound.

Peng!

Hu Taifeng was the first to retreat from the battle. The golem’s damage had already reached 100%.

The reason why he was the first was because he was already determined to fight to the death with Ling Han, so that Princess Bixiaoncould get first place.

Ling Han also paid a price for this, and his defensive power dropped to 50%.

He continued to battle, and after a while, Mei Hua could only retreat helplessly from the battle. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s defensive power dropped to 17%.

When Wu Lidong also retreated out of the battle, Ling Han’s defenses had already fallen to rock bottom.

He was beginning to suffer substantial damage.

Though only Hu Er and Hong Tianbu were left now, the battle prowess of these two people was extremely strong. In terms of power, Ling Han only surpassed them by one third, unlike Hu Taifeng and the others, over whom he had close to a hundred percent advantage in power.

Fight, fight, fight. Both Hu Er and Hong Tianbu showed astonishing natural talent in battle.

However, it was still Ling Han who was stronger.

That was because he had fought his way out of Genesis World, and his battle experience was something that even Hu Er and the others couldn’t compare to.

Peng, right at this moment, the palace doors were already broken open by Princess Bixiao, and a massive dragon-shaped statue shockingly appeared behind the doors..
