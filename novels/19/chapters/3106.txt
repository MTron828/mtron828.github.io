3107 Cultivation technique!

This monkey was quite pitiful.

He had clearly undergone mutation, developed intelligence, and gained great power, but he was suppressed under the mountain as if he was trapped in a cage. However, he still maintained an optimistic mindset, which was truly not easy.

“Senior’s mentality is really good,” Ling Han praised.

“That’s right. I, Old Sun, am invincible among my peers, and it is destined that I will be invincible in the galaxy in the future!” The monkey began to boast again, as if he was completely free of worries. He did not recall at all the fact that he was being suppressed now.

“How should I address Senior?” Ling Han asked.

The monkey thought for a moment and shook his head. “Since I haven’t escaped yet, revealing Old Sun’s real name will damage my reputation! You can call me Monkey Sun.”

His surname was Sun, and he was also a monkey. He was indeed Monkey Sun.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Should I call you Brother Monkey?”

This monkey’s strength seemed to be very shocking. It was not a disgrace for him to call him Brother Monkey.

“Yi?” Monkey Sun looked up at Ling Han, a little surprised. Back then, his brothers and friends had all called him Brother Monkey. Unfortunately, after that period of great chaos, how many of them were still alive now?

He suddenly had an idea. “Brat, shall we become sworn brothers?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ah, become sworn brothers with a monkey?

The corners of Ling Han’s mouth twitched involuntarily. This was a little surreal.

“What is it? Are you looking down on Old Sun?” The monkey was enraged, and his eyes shot out a sharp light. It was extremely terrifying.

Ling Han hurriedly came back to his senses. This monkey seemed to be very sensitive. Yes, it was in line with the impatient nature of a monkey, changing moods very quickly.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “How could that be? I was just shocked by this sudden surprise.”

“Of course. Those who can become sworn brothers with Old Sun are all impressive people.” The monkey immediately smiled again. He had really changed moods quickly.

Ling Han was also a swift and decisive person. He immediately turned around and faced the same direction as the monkey. Then, he knelt down and they kowtowed.

Monkey nodded his head slightly as a form of kowtow.

“Alright, after nine kowtows, we’ll be brothers…” The monkey paused, and looked at Ling Han. “Brother, what’s your name?”

This sworn brother was really muddle-headed. He didn’t even know his name before deciding to become sworn brothers with him.

“Ling Han,” Ling Han replied.

“Brother, your strength doesn’t seem to be much,” said Monkey. He frowned, seemingly very frustrated.

This was truly a temperamental person. Uh, no, a temperamental monkey. He was still being suppressed, but he was already worried for Ling Han.

Ling Han nodded. “I just started cultivating.”

“What cultivation technique did you cultivate?” Monkey asked again.

“None.” Ling Han shook his head.

The monkey revealed a surprised expression. He had completely developed intelligence, so his expression was very rich with emotion.

“If you don’t have a cultivation technique, could it be that you’re using the most primitive method to cultivate?” He looked at Ling Han. Weng, his eyes emitted a bright light as he scanned Ling Han from head to toe.

“This has already allowed you to cultivate to the limit. Hiss, brother, you’re really extraordinary! Yes, the vitality of your body is very powerful. No wonder it can allow you to cultivate to the limit.”

Monkey was very happy and grinned. “As expected of Old Sun’s brother. You also have as much talent as Old Sun from back then!

“Brother, come. Old Sun will teach you a cultivation technique. It was stolen by Old Sun before. Unfortunately, when Old Sun obtained it, Old Sun no longer needed it. Now, it’s all yours,” Monkey said.

Ling Han’s heart trembled. Cultivation technique!

He had always suspected that just using fist techniques to cultivate was not the right path.

There was indeed a cultivation technique.

Ling Han said, “Thank you, Brother Monkey.”

“We’re a family, what are you thanking me for!” Monkey boldly opened his mouth, and instantly spat out golden characters that floated towards Ling Han and sank into his forehead.

Weng, Ling Han’s entire body shook, and ripples appeared in his mind, transforming into ancient words.

He didn’t recognize these words, but he felt that he could understand them. This was very strange.

This had surpassed mere words?

Ling Han nodded in his heart. This was a kind of spiritual resonance.

After a while, these words disappeared, but Ling Han knew that he had grasped a cultivation technique that was suitable for this world.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t the time when the sun first rose at the horizon, so he couldn’t cultivate.

“Brother, the origins of this cultivation technique are astonishing. Not only can you not impart it to others, you can’t even let others know what cultivation technique you’re cultivating. Otherwise, it will bring you great danger!” the monkey said seriously.

Ling Han was solemn. Although they had just met, he felt that he had already figured out this big brother’s temperament—straightforward and frank, with the temperament of a monkey.

“I understand.” He nodded solemnly, and then complained, “Besides, I don’t know the name of this cultivation technique.”

Pausing for a moment, Ling Han asked, “Brother Monkey, can you really escape?”

“Of course!” Monkey said proudly. “This lousy mountain has suppressed Old Sun for so long. How can it suppress me for the rest of my life?”

Ling Han did not say anything. He only made a mental note of this matter. Once he became powerful enough, he would come and help this new big brother escape.

“You can also use this cultivation technique in battle. It will have a miraculous effect. As for the specifics, Old Sun isn’t very clear. After all, Old Sun didn’t cultivate it back then, either,” Monkey said seriously.

“It’s said that this cultivation technique is the foundation of a certain supreme heavenly cultivation technique. However, don’t underestimate it. Only by having a solid foundation can one rush to the peak.”

Without Monkey Sun causing trouble, Ling Han naturally picked the Precious Fruit, and he also went to hunt down a goat, washed it, and roasted it before distributing it among the monkeys.

After sleeping in the valley for a night, Ling Han woke up early the next morning, and sat down cross-legged, waiting for the sun to rise.

Last night, Monkey had given him pointers on the details of his cultivation, helping him understand this cultivation technique thoroughly. Monkey could only express his admiration for Ling Han’s strong comprehension ability.

The moment the sun rose, Ling Han channeled his cultivation technique, and began to extract the power of heaven and earth, turning it into his own energy.

Boom! His body trembled slightly because the amount of energy surging in was astonishing. It was actually 100 times more than when he had been practicing his fist technique.

Previously, it had been like the scouring of a small stream, but now it was like a great river surging, and it was a river that was flooding at that. It was truly turbulent.

Black filth was seeping out of Ling Han’s skin visibly. It was extremely smelly.

Half an hour later, Ling Han stopped, a look of disbelief on his face.

He had already expanded his second meridian to the limit. He couldn’t go any further, or his meridians would explode.

This was too exaggerated.

Originally, he would need at least half a month to reach the peak of Two Meridians, but now he had reached it in a day.

‘Eh, it stinks!’

Ling Han gritted his teeth. This time, he had expelled too many impurities, which was comparable to the total amount that he had expelled previously.

It couldn’t be helped. The improvement this time was simply too great.

He hurriedly ran out of the valley to find a water source to rinse himself off. Wherever he passed, monkeys covered their noses and looked at him with disgust.

Sigh, he was being looked down upon by the monkeys.
