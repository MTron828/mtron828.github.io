Chapter 3623: Thousand-year-old locust tree

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Xiu, xiu, xiu! The small squirrels also launched attacks at Ling Han, and countless fruits smashed towards him.

Ling Han moved. His hands danced, and a gentle force instantly caught hold of the fruit. Then, he threw it diagonally outwards. Hong, hong, hong, the sounds of a great explosion rose and fell, but not a single fruit exploded near Ling Han.

The sword-bearing man’s eyes involuntarily twitched. Ling Han looked to be having an easy time, but his control over power needed to be perfect to the extreme. Only then would he be able to hold the fruit with gentle power. Otherwise, if there was the slightest mistake, the fruit would immediately explode.

To be able to control his power to such a perfect extent, this person was practically a monster.

He hurriedly pulled himself together and followed suit.

Ling Han was already nearing the tree. With a leap, his feet stepped on the tree. Xiu, xiu, xiu, he rushed towards the crown of the tree.

“Zhi, zhi, zhi, zhi!” The little squirrels became anxious, and they all threw the fruits even faster.

Ling Han continuously delivered palm strikes, and gentle power surged, “sending” the fruits away one after another.

“Where are you throwing them?” Below them, the roar of the man with the sword on his back was heard. A few fruits that Ling Han had neutralized were thrown towards him.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly, “Sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose.”

‘I think you did it on purpose.’

The sword-bearing man’s heart was filled with gloom. He could confirm that Ling Han definitely had the ability to control the direction of the fruits he threw out, yet there were a few that were flying towards him. It must have been deliberate on his part.

However, he didn’t have any evidence to accuse Ling Han.

Furthermore, who asked him to follow behind Ling Han?

Actually, he could circle around to the other side of the tree, but that way, he would definitely have to sustain even more fruit attacks, unlike now, when Ling Han had drawn all the firepower. He only had to take note of the fruits that Ling Han had “accidentally” thrown over.

It was naturally very simple for him to make his choice.

Ling Han was already close to the crown of the tree. With a creak, all the squirrels scattered like birds.

He couldn’t help but be stunned. Weren’t you all fierce just now? Why are you cowering now?

Ling Han stood on a branch. Though this was only a branch, it was still incredibly thick. The little squirrels had already fled without a trace. Towards these cowards, Ling Han had no interest in pursuing them.

Xiu, the sword-bearing man also leaped up. He looked at Ling Han with a very complicated gaze.

At first, he had even looked down on Ling Han, but in the blink of an eye, he had to depend on Ling Han’s power to reach the tree, which made him feel slightly embarrassed.

To think that he was a Foundation Building elite.

“I owe you a favor,” he said. He paused, then continued, “My name is Shen Hanyun.”

Ling Han did not even turn his head, and merely nodded.

He felt that it was strange. If there was only the fruit-smashing attacks of the army of squirrels, though this might was very strong, could it protect the old locust tree and allow it to live for more than a thousand years?

Boom, right at this moment, the trunk of the tree suddenly trembled greatly. A massive force surged out, forcefully shaking Ling Han off the trunk of the tree. What was going on? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ling Han wasn’t the only one. Shen Hanyun was also sent flying off the tree.

Peng, peng!

The two of them fell onto the ground. Thankfully, with their strength, they would not be injured even if they fell from a height of three hundred meters.

Neither of them was angered by this, and merely stared dumbly ahead of them.

—That old locust tree had already been uprooted from the ground, its colossal crown actually twisting and deforming. Innumerable branches entwined around each other, forming a dozen or so incredibly thick arms.

“Zhi, zhi, zhi, zhi!” The little squirrels poked their heads out from between the leaves, all of them very excited. The old tree was showing its might. Now, it could destroy all the invaders.

Boom, the old tree moved, swatting out two massive arms, which struck towards Ling Han and Shen Hanyun respectively.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was relieved.

The reason why the old locust tree could last for a thousand years was because it itself also had powerful strength, and not just relying on the help of the little squirrels. And with this move from it, it meant that it was revealing its trump card.

Ling Han raised his fist and clashed with the old locust tree.

Peng! With a single strike, Ling Han was instantly smashed into the ground.

Meanwhile, Shen Hanyun delivered a slash with his sword. Boom! Flames flickered, and this was a great threat to the Tree Man, causing the old tree to retract its arm in time. However, as the force of the blow swept past, it formed a powerful hurricane, and forcibly extinguished the high-level flame energy.

“Goodness, this Lord Tree’s power is really profound.” Ling Han popped out of the ground. Though he was no match for the old locust tree’s power, he himself was also powerful. This blow only caused his blood to boil slightly, and was far from being enough to wound him.

Shua, shua, shua! The old locust tree shook its body, and instantly, several hundred fruits fell at the same time, as if it was raining, extremely densely.

“Run!” Shen Hanyun cried out, and hurriedly leaped out of the way.

If his cultivation level had not been suppressed, then no matter how strong the old locust tree was, he would be able to easily kill it with a single strike.

But now, he had to be careful, or it was possible that he would lose his life here.

Ling Han didn’t dare to face it head-on. The explosive damage of these fruits was far more terrifying than the direct bombardment of the old tree.

The two of them dodged, and had just dodged aside, when the old locust tree delivered another two palm strikes.

Yi, this old tree’s attacks were actually quite organized.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you!” Ling Han humphed. He stimulated the Destructive Energy. In any case, Shen Hanyun wouldn’t be able to see the situation on his side when the black mass of palm strikes shot over.

Peng!

With a palm strike, Ling Han disappeared again. He was forcefully smacked into the ground.

However, it was only an instant, and the old locust tree retreated continuously. Its leaves trembled madly, and a considerable number even fell off, as if it had suffered a great injury.

A hole had shockingly appeared in the “palm” that it had struck Ling Han’s with, and with this as the centre, the surrounding leaves all turned yellow and withered.

Destructive Energy was too terrifying. Even this thousand-year-old locust tree couldn’t withstand it.

Shen Hanyun was dumbfounded. What was going on here? Why had Ling Han suddenly become so powerful?

Ling Han pressed his advantage. The Heavenly Pattern Jade was already unleashed. Its weight was completely compressed, and xiu, he shot it out.

Fourteen times the speed of sound.

The old locust tree’s defenses were extremely high. This kind of creature all had similar characteristics, and that was they could withstand extremely strong attacks. In fact, it would not harm them much at all. The best method to deal with them was firstly, to cut them apart with a sharp weapon, and secondly, to burn them with raging flames.

However, the heavens were just. While they gave the Tree Men extremely high defenses, they also gave them the disadvantage of being slow.

Even if it was a thousand-year-old locust tree, its speed was not all that impressive. At the very least, it could not possibly dodge an attack at fourteen times the speed of sound.

Xiu, the Heavenly Pattern Jade shot over. The old locust tree could only form its branches into an arm to parry this incoming strike. Peng, peng, peng! However, it could not block it. One arm, two, three, it smashed a hole forcefully into over a dozen arms. Under the tremendous ripping power of the Heavenly Pattern Jade, it had even forcefully severed these “arms”.

Thanks to the obstruction of these “arms”, however, the momentum of the Heavenly Pattern Jade was finally used up.

The strength of the Tree Man’s defenses was clear for all to see.

Ling Han was also surprised. He had actually failed to kill him with a single strike?

Then let’s do it again. He charged out, using the Demonic Monkey Fists and the Frequency Attack with 70 overlapping layers of power..
