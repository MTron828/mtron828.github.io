1534 Hold It Right There!

Who could have imagined that Ling Han would be able to withstand the attack of a Saint?

This was completely unfathomable. In fact, the disciples were unable to digest this even though they had witnessed it with their very own eyes.

Hu Yingmu also widened his eyes in shock. He was unable to believe what he saw.

‘What the f*ck?!

‘Holy motherf*cker! Have I been cursed or something, causing the power of my attack to drop considerably? Otherwise, how could an Eternal River Tier elite have blocked my attack? This doesn’t make sense... This doesn’t make any sense at all!’

There was a period of deathly silence before a chorus of deafening cheers suddenly erupted.

This was incredibly uplifting!

Although they had felt refreshed when hearing Ling Han and the large black dog ridicule Hu Yingmu just then, they had all been aware that doing so was merely a cheap shot of no significance. In the end, what was truly important was still strength.

Thus, they had all yearned for there to be a hero, one who could make Hu Yingmu swallow his own words and one who could show Hu Yingmu the might and glory of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy!

However, they had also known that this was merely a daydream. Even the nine Saints couldn’t withstand a single strike of his, so who else would possess the power to battle against him? After all, they couldn’t rely on the Star Sand Saint to step forward, could they? Even if he won, what would it actually prove? It was only natural that a Great Saint would possess a crushing advantage over a Small Saint.

However, just as they were about to fall into despair, a true hero had suddenly stepped forward.

Moreover, he had truly managed to block Hu Yingmu’s strike. In fact, he had walked away from it unscathed!

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

The cheers were deafening, and even the senior disciples started to call Ling Han their senior brother. F*ck, he was someone who could withstand a strike from a Saint! As such, would they feel any embarrassment in calling him senior brother? If they didn’t call him senior brother now, they might not even be able to make friends or claim ties with him in the future!

It was almost a given that Ling Han would become a Saint in the future. In any case, who would believe it if someone claimed otherwise?

Long Xiangyue’s eyes lit up, and there was a look of adoration on her face—this man had once asked for her dragon horn... That was an expression of love!

Meanwhile, Second in the World clicked his tongue in wonder as he quietly mumbled the word “freak”.

His physique was also extremely sturdy, yet Ling Han was already on a whole other level.

Zi Chenfeng, Hong Ma, and the others also shook their heads and sighed in wonderment. The gulf between them and Ling Han had seemingly grown to an insurmountable level already.

Of everyone present, only Ling Han, Empress Luan Xing, and a few others knew that Ling Han hadn’t blocked Hu Yingmu’s attack with his own strength, but rather had relied on the might of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to withstand the attack of the Saint.

In fact, he had already possessed the ability to withstand one full-power strike of a Saint when he was at the Heavenly Body Tier. Now that his cultivation had risen explosively, it was only natural that he could withstand a few more strikes. It was because of this that he had challenged Hu Yingmu to a battle of three strikes.

Of course, this was a very conservative number. He could definitely withstand three strikes.

“Apologize!”

“F*ck off!”

The disciples suddenly started to heckle Hu Yingmu, their expressions fervent and their shouts bordering on wild.

‘This is far too f*cking uplifting; this is far too f*cking soothing!

‘What Saint? Piece of absolute dogsh*t!

‘F*ck off!’

The jeers were like roaring waves, and they were like collapsing mountains. After all, there were also many big shots among the disciples—these were prodigies who had reached the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier. With several thousand disciples present, their combined voice and presence were naturally vast and mighty.

There was a dark expression on Hu Yingmu’s face. This result had far exceeded his expectations, and it was more so a huge slap to his face.

However, apologizing to these people?

Was this possible?

He was an elite from the Forbidden Lands, so how could he raise his head in the future if the others learned that he had apologized to ants in the past?

“There are two more strikes,” he said.

Everyone’s jaw dropped upon hearing this. They couldn’t believe what they were hearing.

‘Are you really a f*cking Saint? Can you be any more f*cking shameless? You’re legitimately going to attack three times?!’

“What kind of f*cking Saint are you?!”

“Utter trash!”

The disciples all booed and jeered. In fact, they could barely contain their urge to stick their middle fingers in Hu Yingmu’s face.

Hu Yingmu acted as if he couldn’t hear them. Compared to the scorn from these ants, he more so didn’t want to apologize to them in public. In any case, it was Ling Han who had asked for him to launch three strikes anyway.

Without waiting for Ling Han’s agreement, he directly raised his palm. He was serious this time, and there was divine light flickering in his eyes. At the same time, a silver river materialized behind his back. This silver river was filled with dazzling stars, so many that they were uncountable at a glance.

Upon seeing this, Ling Han also unleashed his own silver river. He was purposefully doing this to compare their silver rivers.

99 heavenly bodies!

The stark contrast between the might of their silver rivers was truly astounding. Moreover, since they had unleashed their silver rivers, it would be impossible for them to hide their cultivation level.

Boom!

Hu Yingmu lashed out again, his heavenly bodies radiating with brilliance as his palm struck down. An overwhelming pressure crushed the surroundings.

Ling Han didn’t have the time to even dodge this strike. Saints were far too quick in their attack. In fact, this attack had been so quick that even his divine sense hadn’t been able to follow it.

Peng!

The devastating palm strike once again sent plumes of dust and earth into the air.

The disciples all had their hearts in their mouths. Although Ling Han had blocked the strike just then, Hu Yingmu definitely hadn’t been attacking with his full strength.

The dust cleared, revealing a figure who was still standing upright and proud.

“Ling Han!”

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Ling Han!”

The disciples faltered for a moment before roaring in fervent excitement again. Their voices were 100 times louder and more fervent than before.

They were far too excited!

If Hu Yingmu could have still peddled the excuse of not having tried just then, then the result of this strike had truly rendered this excuse void. He had already gathered power for half a day to launch his attack, so could he still be shameless enough to whine and make excuses?

There was a bright glimmer in the eyes of the Star Sand Saint and his nine disciples. They could say with 100% certainty that Ling Han had genuinely withstood both of these attacks with his own abilities. He hadn’t relied on some precious armor or precious robe.

This young man was incredible!

Meanwhile, Hu Yingmu wore a look of shock and disbelief.

‘Why? Why hasn’t he died yet?

‘He’s only at the Eternal River Tier, so why is he so difficult to kill?’

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “There’s still one more strike left. Are you going to use it or not? If not, then retract your statements, apologize, and then piss off!”

Hu Yingmu was boiling with rage, and he truly wanted to kill Ling Han. He refused to believe that an Eternal River Tier elite truly possessed the ability to withstand his attacks. Ling Han had definitely practiced some mysterious technique that would allow him to possess a power that rivaled him for a short period of time.

‘What kind of cultivation technique is this? It’s far too impressive!’

He nodded in his mind. He definitely had to obtain this cultivation technique. Even in the Celestial Realm, such a cultivation technique would still most likely be considered a paramount secret technique. Perhaps it was something that only Celestial Kings could practice!

‘I’ll return and request an ancestor to come and suppress this Great Saint. I’ll then capture Ling Han and force the cultivation technique from him!’

“I admit defeat!” he said. He then turned around to leave.

“Where’s the apology?” the students shouted. They were extremely unhappy with his attitude. Hadn’t he been all arrogant and haughty just then? Why was he cowering now?

Hu Yingmu flicked his sleeves in annoyance. What, were these people going to threaten him or something? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Humph!” A saintly might radiated from the Star Sand Saint’s body, and he said, “The most important quality of cultivators is trust and honor! If you go back on your promise, I’ll make sure to kill you on the spot!”

Hu Yingmu’s expression involuntarily changed. He could indeed rival the power of this Great Saint for a short period of time. However, he could only withstand 100 or so of his attacks. This was the limit of the divine patterns on his precious robe. After that, he would revert to being a Small Saint who was only slightly more powerful than ordinary Small Saints. Thus, what right did he have to argue with a Great Saint?

Moreover, upon seeing the look of resoluteness on the Star Sand Saint’s face, he was certain that this Great Saint wasn’t joking around with him.

Wise men didn’t fight against the odds.

Hu Yingmu hesitated for a moment before saying, “I retract my previous statements and apologize!”

The disciples instantly whooped in joy upon hearing this. Just how arrogant had Hu Yingmu been just then? Yet, he was being forced to obediently apologize now!

This was the might of the Star Sand Saint! This was the might of Ling Han!

Hu Yingmu turned around in bitter resentment and was just about to leave.

“Hold it right there!” Ling Han said as he dashed before Hu Yingmu. There was raging killing intent in his eyes, and he said, “You were apologizing for your ignorance just then. Now, however, I want to settle another score with you. You actually dared to target my wife! Toward people like you... I have a habit of killing them without mercy!”

Pu!

Everyone was transfixed with shock upon hearing this. Many people couldn’t help but splutter in astonishment.

‘What, what, what? Am I hearing things? Is there something wrong with my ears?!’
