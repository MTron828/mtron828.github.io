Chapter 906: Coming Up With An Idea

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han could only wander on the first floor of the library, but the books there were all accessible to him, without any restrictions on reading.

Obviously, these were techniques and arts below Immortal level.

Ling Han was also not in a hurry to find the alchemical arts; he slowly flipped through the books as he walked along.

The Origin Power cultivation technique which he was currently cultivating was by no means a top-notch one. If he wanted to rely on the Extreme Yang Technique to attain the strength of an additional four Stars outside of Origin Power, it would be tough! He might have to stop at the strength of 18 or 19 Stars.

Therefore, he intended to practice a different cultivation technique.

Changing to a different cultivation technique would inevitably have a considerable impact on his advancement into higher cultivation levels, but was absolutely necessary in order to charge towards the strength limit of 20 Stars.

The Scarlet Heaven Academy, or at least the Northern Institution, was very generous. There was a lot of techniques here, all complete with ten levels of cultivation and usable to cultivate up to the peak of the Shattering Void Tier. After reaching this step, one could apply at the Academy to learn the elites’ method of cultivation—such as instructions and technique applications—for charging towards the Mountain River Tier.

After stepping into the Mountain River Tier, the rest would depend on the individual.

This was also the unchanging and eternal truth of the martial arts world: practicing cultivation would always be your own personal matter. If you couldn’t understand any obscure theory, then no one would be able to explain it clearly to you. You could only think about it yourself, which might take a few days or a few years before you finally comprehended it. There was also a possibility that you would be stuck at this hurdle for a lifetime.

It was practically fatal for a cultivator to develop a habit of relying on others.

After searching for a long time, Ling Han did not find a technique most suitable for himself. While pushing one’s strength to nine Stars, 10 Stars, or even 11 Stars of Shattering Void Tier was relatively simple, breaking through to 12 or 13 stars was extremely difficult—an improvement by one Star was akin to reaching for the heavens.

After a moment’s contemplation, he suddenly felt a burst of inspiration, and thought to himself, ‘Now, I am complete with six attributes. What if I practice six different cultivation techniques and combine them?’

With such a thought, he suddenly felt an uncontrollable excitement.

He searched high and low for six techniques of similar level and comprising of six attributes, which belonged to the category of the five elements 1 and thunder, and then memorized each of them.

... The materials here couldn’t be taken out. Unlike traditional books, these techniques were inscribed on bone—some were beast bones, and some were even human bones, and holding them was slightly hair-raising.

As the fingers touched them, the bones glowed, and the techniques were manifested—they were all seen as interweaving secret patterns, and not real words. There was also a chart of veins, which described the route of flow of Origin Power and certain concealed acupuncture points in the human body that needed to be unblocked.

“So there are such things!”

This truly opened Ling Han’s eyes. He came from a small world, and even if he had lived two lifetimes, this was something he couldn’t change. Given the limitations of the environment in a small world, he had only studied two types of ten-level techniques—one was from the Sea Race, and another one from the five sects.

These techniques could at best allow him to cultivate his strength to the level of 11 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, still two Stars away from reaching the limit of Origin Power.

Ling Han was utterly engrossed in going through the techniques. He was already standing at the pinnacle of the ninth layer of the Shattering Void Tier; these techniques were just a reference for him, not a difficult problem that would constantly drive him up the wall in frustration. He couldn’t help but be extremely delighted.

He was confident that he could break through and attain the strength of 13 Stars of Origin Power after integrating the six techniques.

There was no need to worry about Body Arts—the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art was absolutely awesome, enough for him to reach the utmost limit of brute force.

After spending just less than half a day, he closed his eyes in satisfaction. Then, after exhaling a long breath, he revealed a smile. He put the bone books back in place before heading off in search of alchemical arts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘Found it!’

Ling Han found an ancient scripture. This one was an actual book. Flipping through it, he saw that it recorded the techniques to refine Level Ten alchemical pills, and described the effects of some Level Ten alchemical pills on cultivators of Mountain River Tier.

For example, Replenishing Spirit Pill.

Ling Han wasn’t greedy; he decided to only work on the recipe for this alchemical pill for the time being.

He memorized the pill’s recipe—it was a simple matter as long as one had a memory good enough. This wouldn’t be a problem for most cultivators. The difficulty lay in extracting the patterns from the medicinal ingredients and weaving them together during the process of concocting the pills.

It was too easy to make mistakes. A moment of inattentiveness, and the incorrect interweaving of patterns would cause the whole concoction to be completely destroyed.

Therefore, this pill recipe’s record of the ingredients was only a simple half a page, while the method of interweaving the patterns used up full 18 pages, and this was just a Level Ten alchemical pill—the God-level alchemical pills were even more terrifying. One whole book would only record the recipe of one alchemical pill, and this book would be outrageously voluminous.

Fortunately, the lifespan of Immortals was long enough, so they would have enough time to learn many more pill recipes. Otherwise, someone with Shattering Void Tier’s lifespan would only be able to study a dozen or so God-level pill recipes.

After spending another half a day, Ling Han finally closed the book and shut his eyes, digesting the information on this particular pill recipe.

This might just be a recipe for Replenishing Spirit Pill, but since it would have certain effects on cultivators of the Mountain River Tier, its recipe was naturally complicated, and could be regarded as the recipe for a pseudo God-level pill. For Ling Han who was merely in the Shattering Void Tier, refining it would be quite difficult.

‘The strength of my spirit has been greatly improved by the Reincarnation Tea. Furthermore, with the cultivation of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, the strength of my spirit is stable enough to refine this Replenishing Spirit Pill,’ Ling Han thought to himself confidently.

‘However, alchemy is a process of trial and error. From failure to success, it might take a few times, or possibly dozens of times. I only possess two True Origin Stones—I’m not sure how many ingredients I can buy.’

He put the ancient book back in its original place, and then turned around to leave. He planned to go out of the Academy to buy the ingredients for refining the Replenishing Spirit Pill.

When Ling Han came to the library’s main entrance, the white-haired elderly man glanced at him, and when Ling Han walked out through the doors, the old man suddenly said, “I am surnamed Xu, you can call me Old Man Xu. Do drop by when you have the time, I like chatting with young people.”

Ling Han was startled. He turned around and slightly bowed at the old man, and said, “Yes, Senior.”

Although the old man’s aura wasn’t conspicuous, and he looked like any ordinary old man, would there be any useless person in the Scarlet Heaven Academy?

His whole person exuded a lofty and unyielding disposition, but it was different from being haughty and arrogant.

Old Man Xu waved his hand at Ling Han. He stood there until Ling Han turned and walked away. After Ling Han’s figure disappeared, Old Man Xu murmured, “This kid actually intends to practice six different cultivation techniques! Hehe, not many people know that it would be impossible to charge towards the ultimate strength of Origin Power by merely practicing one cultivation technique, but a cultivator from a small world actually chanced upon the solution by chance. This is really interesting.

“This is certainly luck, but luck is also a part of one’s strength. Had it not been... then I wouldn’t have fallen into such circumstances. This is my destiny, my luck!

“Perhaps, the regrets of this old man could be made up by this kid!”

Just as Old Man Xu said the last sentence, his gaze suddenly sparkled, and a frightening aura surrounded his whole body. However, a black-colored chain also appeared simultaneously, and tightly wrapped itself around Elder Xu’s chest, causing him to cough up blood incessantly.

Four galaxies had actually appeared behind him, and each of them was of the same size—had anyone seen this, they would be absolutely shocked to the core.

Who would have thought that an elderly man guarding the library in the Northern Institution was actually a peerless elite whose cultivation level had reached the pinnacle of perfection level of the Heavenly Body Tier?
