“Brother Wolf is so mighty!” A boot-licking voice rang out. Everyone looked over, and they were so furious that they almost killed someone.

That was actually Qin Zhengchu!

‘You f****** are a member of the Dark North Nation, and your father is one of the Four Great Generals, but you actually publicly flatter a foreigner. Do you still have any integrity?’

“Qin Zhengchu, you’ve truly impressed me!” Xuanyuan Dingguo couldn’t help but mock.

“Xuanyuan, you’re just crying sour grapes because you can’t eat them, and are jealous that I’ve become friends with Young Master Hu,” Qin Zhengchu said shamelessly.

Xuanyuan Dingguo trembled in anger and rebuked, “How could General Vajra have such an unbearable descendant like you!”

“You are very arrogant!” Brother Wolf pointed at Xuanyuan Dingguo and said, “Brother Qin is Young Master Hu’s friend. You insulting Brother Qin is equivalent to insulting Young Master Hu. Come, come, come, see how Brother Wolf will deal with you!”

Xuanyuan Dingguo humphed again. Who was he?

A second-generation young master of one of the most powerful of the Dark North Nation, and he was actually being looked down upon like this. How could he accept this?

However, he was an Extreme Bone Tier, while the other party was only a Blood Transformation Tier. So what if he won?

Now that it had evolved into a clash on the level of cultivation of the two nations, it would not be glorious for him to win on the basis of his cultivation level, and if he lost, that would be even more humiliating.

—Don’t say that there was no possibility of losing. Because he had just broken through, though his various abilities had all been greatly improved, he had not stabilized his cultivation level, after all. Compared to when he had been at the peak stage of the Fifth Change, his battle prowess had only doubled, at most.

This Brother Wolf was freakishly strong, and he had absolutely no confidence that he could win.

“I disdain from picking on the weak,” Xuanyuan Dingguo said coldly. He refused to battle.

“Pei, trash!” Brother Wolf humphed.

“You’re nothing but an uncivilized person from the wilderness. What’s there to be proud of?” A cold voice rang out, and a man strode over.

Hong Tianliang!

Instantly, everyone was excited.

“Hong Tianliang is here!”

“Although he lost to Ling Han in the hunting competition, it can’t be denied that he’s powerful.”

“Furthermore, so many days have passed, so he may have become much stronger.”

Under everyone’s expectant gazes, Hong Tianliang stepped onto the tournament stage.

Young Master Hu glanced at Hong Tianliang, and his eyes involuntarily lit up. “This person has some strength.”

“Little Wolf, Young Master Hu said that this person has some strength,” a cloaked person immediately called out.

Brother Wolf laughed and said, “Then I’ll use 70% of my strength to deal with him.”

Hong Tianliang had become more and more composed. Otherwise, he would definitely fly into a thunderous rage upon hearing this. However, he had been defeated by Ling Han time and time again, so his personality had also undergone a great change.

He simply formed his hands into claws, and silver-colored blood and Qi surged behind him.

He had advanced into the Third Change!

What an astonishing rate of advancement. Following a freakish elder brother, could his strength actually soar so madly?

Hong Tianliang’s blood and Qi boiled at the first instant. Boom! The Condensed Blood Beast was a white tiger that released a soundless roar. However, everyone felt as if their souls were trembling, and they couldn’t help but want to lie down.

“As expected, you do have some strength.” Brother Wolf’s body also enlarged. “However, you actually dare to condense it into the form of a tiger; you are truly outrageously bold!”

Xiu, he leaped back onto the tournament stage, and took the initiative to charge towards Hong Tianliang.

Peng, peng, peng! The two of them battled fiercely, but Hong Tianliang was immediately at a disadvantage.

It could not be helped. He was only a Third Change, and was much inferior to Brother Wolf in terms of raw power, and with the eruption of his boiling blood and Qi, he fell even further behind.

“Is that all you’ve got?” Brother Wolf asked in slight disappointment.

Hong Tianliang was unmoved, and merely humphed coldly. Boom, a layer of grey light immediately wrapped around his hands.

“Yi, high-level energy?” Only now did Brother Wolf get a shock. “In the Dark North Nation, there is actually someone that can use high-level energy?”

In his eyes, in such a backward country, this should be a territory that no one could touch.

“However, you still have a long way to go!” With a battle cry, Brother Wolf waved his hands, and similarly, a dusky light flickered.

Hong Tianliang was astonished. The other party could actually absorb high-level energy as well? One had to realize that even a freak like Ling Han did not know how to absorb high-level energy!

Peng!

He didn’t hesitate to clash head-on with Hong Tianliang, but it was clear who was stronger. The gray energy on his hands was quickly dispersed, and Brother Wolf took advantage of the victory to follow up with another attack, blasting Hong Tianliang out of the arena with a single strike.

Everyone fell silent. Even Hong Tianliang had been horribly defeated. Who else in the Blood Transformation Tier could match this Brother Wolf?

“Hahaha, hahahaha!” Brother Wolf laughed madly. That was how insufferable he was, and how arrogant he was.

“What are you howling for? Don’t you know that you’re howling like a wolf? And that it is very unpleasant to hear?” Ling Han asked calmly, appearing especially out of place in this silent environment.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes turned towards Ling Han.

Ling Han put down his wine cup, and suddenly stood up.

“It’s you again!” Brother Wolf stared at Ling Han, his eyes burning.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and asked, “What is it? You miss me already?”

“Cheeky mouth!” Brother Wolf humphed, crooked his finger, and said, “Come on, let’s see how Brother Wolf will deal with you!”

Ling Han jumped onto the tournament stage, flexed his muscles and bones, and said, “I hope your skin is tougher, and not too fragile.”

Brother Wolf was furious. ‘You haven’t even fought yet, and you’re already so arrogant. How detestable.’

He couldn’t help it, and immediately rushed towards Ling Han.

Hong Tianliang immediately looked attentive. Though he had not seen Ling Han’s face, he could not be more familiar with Ling Han’s voice. He recognized him at the first instant.

At this moment, his emotions were very complicated. He both hoped that Ling Han could win, because Brother Wolf and his group were from Yue Empire, which naturally made them enemies. However, if Brother Wolf was defeated by Ling Han, he would feel terrible.

That was because he had lost.

Peng!

Ling Han was completely unafraid, and greeted the attack head-on with a punch.

Power shot out in all directions, and the arms that the two of them had stretched out did not move at all. They were evenly matched.

“What?!”

Those cloaked figures all revealed shocked expressions, and even Young Master Hu straightened up slightly.

They naturally knew that “Brother Wolf” was at the cultivation level of Fifth Change. Moreover, with how powerful their bloodline was, their power far surpassed that of an ordinary Fifth Change. However, Ling Han was clearly only at Third Change, and his blood and Qi was extremely obvious. It was pure silver, meaning that he had reached the peak stage of the Third Change.

However, a Third Change was actually capable of standing against a Fifth Change. What justice was there left in this world?

Weren’t they the only ones who could defeat an opponent stronger than themselves?

“Human, I’ve underestimated you!” Brother Wolf immediately roared. Xiu, xiu, xiu! His hands danced rapidly, and added with his hunched figure, he no longer looked like a human at all. Instead, he looked like a wild wolf.

“Hiding your head and showing your tail! Show me your true face!” Ling Han unleashed the Demonic Monkey Fists. He threw a punch, and the power of his fist condensed into the form of a Demonic Monkey. It was incredibly domineering, and it was as if it could suppress heaven and earth!

“What!” Young Master Hu immediately became excited.

Meanwhile, Brother Wolf was furious. ‘You’re wearing a mask yourself, and you still dare to accuse me of hiding myself.’

He roared loudly, and exchanged blows with Ling Han.

An astonishing scene appeared. That force that had taken the form of the Demonic Monkey seemed to come to life, swallowing the force that Brother Wolf had shot out. Then, it continued to attack.

Peng! Brother Wolf was instantly sent flying. His cloak exploded, revealing his true appearance.

‘What the f*ck?!
