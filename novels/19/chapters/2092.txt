Chapter 2093: Arrival of various Celestial Kings

Four-colored halos of light shone, as if there were four extremely powerful streaks of Heavenly Dao protecting him.

It was another Celestial King, and also a Fourth Heaven Celestial King at that. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lu Hairong looked solemn. Even if she originated from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, she did not dare to underestimate the other in the slightest, because what person that had advanced into the ranks of Celestial Kings was not an extraordinarily talented genius?

Especially for a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, who had undergone innumerable trials. His battle prowess was definitely like a Heavenly Sword that could kill anything.

“How should I address you?” Lu Hairong turned her eyes on this Celestial King.

This Celestial King showed a faint smile. “Dhara Sect, Full Winds Celestial King.”

Lu Hairong nodded. “Roc Palace, Lu Hairong.”

“So you are the renowned Sea Heavenly King!” Full Winds Celestial King chuckled, and clasped his hands in greeting. “I have long since heard of the great name of the Sea Heavenly King, and meet you today finally. Nice to meet you.”

“You are too polite.” Lu Hairong also smiled. The other party was a Celestial King, and could not be underestimated.

“The Roc Palace only accepts female disciples. This boy should not have any relation to your esteemed sect.” The Full Winds Celestial King changed the topic suddenly, and the conversation turned back onto Ling Han. “Thus, I would like the Sea Heavenly King to please give me some face, and hand this boy over to me.”

Lu Hairong shook her head. “That would be difficult to comply with.”

“Sea Heavenly King, you are making it difficult for me!” Full Winds Celestial King sighed, a troubled expression on his face.

“Hehe.” Lu Hairong chuckled. She was indeed wary of the other party’s strength, and indeed did not want to make any more powerful enemies for the Roc Palace, but if it really came down to a battle, she would not cower back in the slightest, either.

“Then, the only option is deciding through force,” Full Winds Celestial King said.

“Come then!” Lu Hairong declared proudly.

She definitely did not dare to underestimate the other party, but was also filled with confidence in her own abilities. One came from an Eighth Heaven Celestial King Tier force, while the other was from a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. Even though there was only a difference of one Heaven, it had already been mentioned that there were Nine Heavens in Celestial King Tier, and every step forwards was as difficult as climbing the heavens. Who could afford this difference?

For a great Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier sect, they taught astonishingly many cultivation techniques. This was an existence that stood at the apex of the Celestial Realm, and had accumulated unknown treasures in their possession.

Thus, in a battle of equal levels, she had enough confidence that she could win.

“Hehe, allow me to join in.” With a light laugh, a man strode forwards through the air. He was clearly not very tall or broad, but it seemed like even the heavens would prostrate beneath his feet. Propitious red clouds spread around him for thousands of meters, and a four-colored light surrounded him.

It was another Fourth Heaven Celestial King!

Seeing Lu Hairong look towards him, this Celestial King showed a cordial smile. “Cloudy Waves Valley, Celestial King Yuanfang.”

Ang, a beastly roar rang out, and hot clouds of volcanic ash appeared on the horizon. Then, these clouds of volcanic ash flew over at an astonishing speed. Then, the clouds dispersed, revealing a man of tall, broad build.

His upper body was bare, and there was an indescribably malevolent wolf-shaped tattoo on his chest.

This was not a tattoo, but something he was born with. There was a vague light of great dao flowing through it, exuding an intimidating pressure.

“Golden Crow Sect, Green Wolf!” this large man declared, his voice as loud as booming thunder. Beneath them, a great many people were instantly knocked unconscious from just his voice.

The might of a Celestial King would shake the heavens and earth, and a single thought would shake down even the stars in the skies.

Lu Hairong’s eyes involuntarily narrowed slightly, and she finally looked wary.

Celestial King Tier was too hard to attain, but what person who had become a Celestial King was not an extremely talented prodigy, a prodigy among prodigies? In a battle of one against one, she had absolute confidence that she could win, and in a battle of one versus two, she was also confident that she would not lose, but in a battle of one against three… the result would not be too certain.

More importantly, Hu Niu was still here, and she was the future Imperial Empress of the Roc Palace, bearing the future of every single person in the Roc Palace on her shoulders. She definitely could not come to the slightest bit of harm.

Thus, she was filled with qualms, and did not dare go all out in battle.

More importantly, if Hu Niu was captured, the Four Seas Palace would definitely be willing to offer an astonishingly exorbitant price in exchange for her, and possibly even an Eighth Heaven Celestial King would be unable to refuse this kind of offer.

For example, Celestial medicine that was epochs in age, or a Source Power of heaven and earth—as long as they had not reached Ninth Heaven yet, the Source Powers of heaven and earth was still a good reference material for even Celestial Kings.

“We only want this brat,” Celestial King Yuanfang said, pointing at Ling Han.

“If the Sea Heavenly King does not allow it, we can only come to blows.”

“However… the safety of these few girls could not be guaranteed by then.”

The three Celestial Kings each made their attempts of persuasion. There was completely no need to waste too many words when one had reached their level. They would be able to transmit their opinions with a single look, and move simultaneously.

It was absolutely impossible for a man to be a disciple of the Roc Palace, but it was possible that the women were ones. Though they did not know which one it was, or if it was all of them, it would do to just use all of them as a threat.

Immediately, Lu Hairong’s expression changed. This was her weak point.

In a great battle between Celestial Kings, even if she had drawn Hu Niu into her Spatial God Tool, it would not be safe. It was highly possible that the Spatial God Tool would crumble in battle, and the shock wave from a Celestial King Tier-level attack would easily kill her.

Three Fourth Heaven Celestial Kings were completely qualified to threaten her.

At this time, everyone else had become the background, and the meaning of their existence was that of mere spectators. Even Fei Qiang, the host, did not dare speak a single word. In front of Celestial Kings, however strong an Ascending Origin Tier was, they were still trash.

“Sea Heavenly King, how about it?” Green Wolf Celestial King asked loudly, each word turning into a seal of Heavenly Dao.

He was so strong that his words had taken solid form, capable of suppressing the world.

Lu Hairong showed a conflicted expression. For the pride of the Roc Palace, she initially should have responded in an incredibly assertive manner, and battled fiercely, leaving boldly after severely wounding one or two Celestial Kings, but now she was considering the idea of compromising.

However important Ling Han was, his value could not possibly surpass Hu Niu’s.

“Ugly hag, beat them up, beat these guys up!” Though Hu Niu was usually not very reliable, her insight was extremely skilled. Immediately, she could see the conflict that Lu Hairong was in, and rebelled at the first moment.

F***, how could Niu’s Ling Han be allowed to come to danger?

“Sea Heavenly King, please reconsider!” The Full Winds Celestial King’s eyes were set on Hu Niu, his gaze flickering.

Though there was quite a distance between them, the Full Winds Celestial King had still heard about some matters of the Roc Palace. After all, it was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force. Even in the Western Celestial Realm, there were only about a dozen or so such forces.

In the past, the Roc Palace had flourished greatly, with two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings standing guard, and had the domineering air of the strongest force in the Celestial Realm, but as the last Imperial Empress died in an ambush, the Roc Palace began slowly declining from their extreme prosperity. Presently, it was besieged by the Four Seas Palace, and was struggling on the borders of survival.

To garner such wariness from Lu Hairong, and to actually be able to call a Fourth Heaven Celestial King an “ugly hag”, Hu Niu’s identity was abundantly clear!

…The next Imperial Empress of the Roc Palace!

If Hu Niu was captured, and handed over to the Four Seas Palace, how would he be rewarded?

That was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier force that had existed for who knew how many epochs, and had to have astonishingly great wealth.

The moment this thought arose in him, his heart immediately became excited, and could not be suppressed.

To kill Lu Hairong, he naturally did not have the slightest bit of confidence, but if it was merely grabbing two Dividing Soul Tier juniors, he was filled with confidence.

What he had thought of, how could the Green Wolf Celestial King and Celestial King Yuanfang not think of? Their eyes also landed on Hu Niu, revealing a heated gaze.

Lu Hairong saw this happen, and immediately decided. She declared, “Fine, this boy can be handed over to you.” She definitely could not allow anything to happen to Hu Niu.

“Ugly hag, what nonsense are you saying!” Hu Niu howled in fury.

Full Winds Celestial King and the others exchanged looks, and nodded respectively. For the moment, it was best not to provoke Lu Hairong. After all, she was also a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, and if she really put her life on the line, it was highly possible that she could drag one or two of them down with her.

They would capture Ling Han first, and then they would inform the Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings, Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings, or even stronger existences in their sects. By then, they would naturally be able to apprehend both Lu Hairong and Hu Niu.
